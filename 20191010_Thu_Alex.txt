[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Gavin McInnes is back with his all new online network,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.760]   freespeech.tv.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.900]   Gavin McInnes, Joe Biggs, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Soph,
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.260]   all at freespeech.tv.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.000]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   - From the front lines of the information war,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.540]   it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.380]   - It is Thursday, October 10th, 2019.
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.620]   I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.180]   Now I'm going to be co-hosting with Will Johnson tonight
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.300]   from seven past nine o'clock during Firepower
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.220]   at infowars.com/show,
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.220]   covering the live Minneapolis, Minnesota rally
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.380]   that Trump is going to be holding.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.900]   I'll talk more about that in a moment.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.060]   As you know, the mayor is trying to keep the president
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.180]   from being able to speak,
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.700]   and that ties into a key point we'll hit in a second.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.180]   First off, the corporate media is very breathless.
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.740]   CBS News last night ran a story saying,
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.500]   "Read the second complaint of the second whistleblower."
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.940]   And when I read it, the story is that it's not a story.
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.820]   It's just stunning how they recycle the same thin air
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.460]   as if it's a giant porterhouse steak
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.380]   perfectly cooked on your plate
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.180]   with a side of mashed potatoes and carrots.
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.860]   It is a complete mirage.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.900]   It simply says, oh, that the person had knowledge
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.380]   of someone who simply was listening to, again,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.540]   the same phone call.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.980]   So more hearsay off of the hearsay
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.540]   when we have the transcript of what the president said.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.460]   They're also hoaxing, saying that Mike Pence
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.620]   was involved in bad stuff.
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.700]   He's trying to release his transcript.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.180]   But here's why this fraud is still successful.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.060]   It still makes the Republicans get on the defensive
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.700]   and start responding to the Democrats
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.180]   like they're the authority,
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.580]   like they're the boss up on high
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.540]   as they fire up this fake impeachment inquiry.
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.100]   And again, the impeachment's real.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.260]   They're moving forward,
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.740]   but it's not even through the lawful procedures.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.540]   It's done through an exploratory committee
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.220]   of an impeachment inquiry
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.580]   so they don't have to do the investigation
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.580]   with due process.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.580]   Again, unprecedented criminal activity.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.180]   They've made a conscious decision to engage
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.180]   in classical fraud, classical criminal activities
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.840]   at every level.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.380]   Now, let's shift gears into why I'm getting into Minnesota
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.180]   and the Trump problem tonight being so important.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.620]   There are articles out every single day.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.580]   So many reports that I really have gotten
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.220]   to a shell-shocked point and hardly ever cover it
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.780]   where major universities in Europe, in England,
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.620]   in Canada, and in the US, and as far away as Australia,
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.980]   which is called a globalized standard system,
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.100]   are telling white students
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.380]   that they have to go to mandatory classes
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.500]   and mandatory film screenings
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.300]   to learn how white people are inherently evil
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.500]   and how basically all sex is rape
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.700]   and just incredibly divisive systems.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.820]   And I've seen three articles just this week
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.500]   from England and the US where major universities
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.260]   are having anti-racism events,
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.360]   but then saying that white people can't come to those.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.340]   Paul Watson has an article today about Sheffield, England,
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.820]   actually where he's from,
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.820]   and the college there locally engaging in this.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.900]   They say it's not enough to be anti-racism.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.140]   You've got to be, quote,
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.060]   "Actively out there engaging all forms of it."
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.620]   Well, that means whiteness, America, the West, culture,
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.460]   any of that is evil, any of that is bad.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.940]   Take Sweden.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.420]   They've announced they're gonna ban all teaching
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.300]   in colleges and in primary school
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.820]   of Swedish culture and their history
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.860]   because Sweden itself existing
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.780]   and once being a homogeneous Viking culture is evil.
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.860]   So again, this is a global corporate system
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.180]   to erase any identity in the West
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.100]   so that the new technocracy backed up
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.140]   by the Chai-coms can take over.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.980]   And that ties into the mayor of Minneapolis
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.820]   saying Trump is a white supremacist.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.260]   He shouldn't be allowed to come into Minnesota
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.020]   or Minneapolis.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.780]   Again, it's all about barring people's speech,
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.300]   barring their action,
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.940]   using a global social credit score to totally control people.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.580]   And that's why this is so dangerous.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.820]   They're consciously doing this
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.580]   and they're training our children and others
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.140]   that they have no rights.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.780]   And we can laugh at this as adults,
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.140]   but in just another generation,
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.100]   this will be in place if we do not stand up
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.620]   and say no to all of it.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.980]   Tom Papert's coming up.

[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.900]   And they've been approving almost all the scripts
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.620]   that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.740]   And now they own our debt.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.060]   Now they own the Democratic Party.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.580]   Now they've merged with Silicon Valley
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.820]   to censor patriots off the air.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.580]   Washington Post comes out and says they hope
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.100]   that Xi Jinping, the dictator of China,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.980]   will, quote, "destroy Trump."
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.540]   That's a headline.
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.260]   So InfoWars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.100]   We have blown the whistle continuously
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.260]   and have been proven right.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.660]   And that's why it's more important than ever
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.060]   that we override Silicon Valley
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.100]   and their Qaikom masters by word of mouth
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.100]   and spread the word about InfoWars

[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.860]   Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide,
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.140]   it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.540]   - Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.020]   I am Tom Paffert, filling in for Alex today
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.540]   while he is out on a very important mission.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.700]   I just wanna recap on a quick programming note.
[00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.220]   Alex Jones will be live tonight on Firepower,
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.820]   where I'm usually co-hosting with Will Johnson.
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.860]   That's 7 p.m. tonight for the Trump rally.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.260]   Make sure to tune into that.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.820]   It is a scary situation and an unprecedented situation,
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.980]   what's happening in Minneapolis
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.820]   as the left-wing city administration
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.380]   is attempting to recreate what we have seen
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.980]   all across the country and, as Alex said
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.980]   in the last segment, all throughout the world.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.500]   It's now common practice,
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.940]   anytime a right-wing populist conservative
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.340]   wants to speak on a college campus
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.300]   or speak in a city at all,
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.740]   they ratchet up security costs to make the event unviable.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.540]   This results, of course, in the venue canceling the event,
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.820]   the people have to find a new venue,
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.260]   it may be the guests, the people who have bought tickets
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.860]   can't find the new venue.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.860]   The event may go on, it may go from 3,000 people to 150.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.900]   This happens constantly throughout the United States,
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.980]   but it has never happened before to an American politician,
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.820]   let alone a sitting president of the United States
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.300]   like Donald J. Trump.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.380]   Unprecedented what's happening,
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.420]   and it will be fascinating to see exactly what happens.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.340]   So again, make sure you tune in tonight for "Firepower"
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.940]   at 7 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.500]   We've seen, over this last week,
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.700]   a complete capitulation on behalf of corporate America
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.460]   to the communist Chinese,
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.820]   and this is something the viewers of this broadcast
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.900]   have known about for 10 or more years,
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.780]   especially over the past two years,
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.660]   nobody has been more on point on this subject
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.740]   than Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.860]   And again, just to recap,
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.260]   this week we saw the NBA offer a complete capitulation.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.180]   We've seen Blizzard, a video game company,
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:45.740]   banning popular streamers because they had the audacity
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.540]   to hope and pray and endorse a free, democratic Hong Kong
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.900]   that respects human liberty.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.300]   We've seen, I just saw a report about a hotel
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.660]   that reportedly fired an employee
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.660]   because they had the audacity to like a Twitter post
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.780]   about Hong Kong.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.780]   This is, I would say, unprecedented,
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.420]   but if you've been following along,
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.860]   you know that Alex Jones was banned over a year ago
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.700]   because he was a threat
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.740]   to the Chinese communist world order.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.740]   As Alex Jones frequently says,
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.260]   "The communist Chinese own our movies."
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.060]   They own the majority of Hollywood production studios.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.740]   The ones they don't own, though, it doesn't even matter
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.340]   because in order for a movie to get into China,
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.260]   China only accepts a handful of movies a year.
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.300]   And in order for a movie to get into China,
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.340]   they have to tow the Chinese communist line.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.580]   So we have a special message
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.900]   from Fentanyl the Qicom Dragon.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.100]   Let's go ahead and air that
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.660]   about how the NBA is capitulating
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.660]   and how it is serving our master, Xi Jinping.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.740]   Let's air that video.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.780]   (dramatic music)
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.100]   (camera shutter clicks)
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:15.540]   - Hello, stupid Americans.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.580]   Fentanyl Chinese communist dragon here.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.820]   I told you just a week ago,
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:24.420]   when you don't do what we say, you die.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.220]   Look what happened to a Hong Kong protester.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.820]   Oh, and don't forget, we killed more than Hitler ever did.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.220]   And that's why the liberals love us.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.060]   Oh.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:42.460]   In America, the colleges that we fund
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.300]   teach no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.980]   Let me show you a trained slave.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.980]   - No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.900]   - America is a rotting carcass
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.220]   covered in filthy maggots.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.740]   Look at your own James Harden.
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.540]   He came out and apologized to us.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.900]   That's good.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.900]   And now we tell the NBA what to do
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.620]   and the NBA say, "Yes, master."
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.780]   - Yeah, we apologize.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.340]   We love China.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.540]   We love playing there.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.460]   - Finally, you saw what happened to South Park.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.060]   They talk about our re-education camps
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.940]   and our death camps and how Winnie the Pooh was banned.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.860]   And let me now tell you what happens.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.620]   They abandon our country.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.420]   Then they put out sarcastic apologies.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.900]   That's not good enough.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.620]   Once we take over, we're going to kill
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.260]   the South Park producers.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.380]   That's what we do.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:49.100]   Everyone is adopting our motto.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.260]   Big Tech is censoring Alex Jones
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.340]   and now even Republican leaders.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.580]   And they do nothing.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.340]   Soon sites like BandarVideo will be shut down.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.060]   You stinking Americans do not share that site
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.700]   or Infowars.com.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.620]   Submit.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.900]   Do not fight back.
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.260]   Do what I say.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:16.980]   I just caught you, American.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.420]   You visited BandarVideo.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.740]   Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.700]   Do what CNN says and do not visit BandarVideo
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.020]   or I have to hurt your eyes.
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:35.060]   - That of course was Fentanyl the Chai-Kahn Dragon.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.980]   You can view the whole series on BandarVideo.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.340]   But folks, let me tell you,
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.540]   every single joke in that video is absolutely spot on.
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.940]   At this point, the Chinese Communist Party
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.420]   is involved in organ harvesting.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.620]   They're involved in concentration camps
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.540]   for an ethnic minority.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.340]   They're involved in open murder of Hong Kong protesters.
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.220]   These protesters are to the point
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.340]   where they're wearing projectors on their face
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.740]   to block out their face with light so they can't be seen.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.220]   They paint their face like Pepe the Frog.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.340]   So the Chinese surveillance state,
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.740]   which has millions of cameras on every street corner
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.740]   in the country, can't identify who is protesting.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.460]   And what's more important,
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.620]   the point that Alex brings up constantly,
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.140]   is this is the model that the globalists
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.340]   want to bring to the United States.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.420]   There was this great fantasy before I was alive
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.580]   and when Alex Jones was a very young man,
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.820]   that by trading freely with the communist Chinese,
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.740]   we would export our ideology of democracy
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.340]   and human liberty and peace.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.020]   And now, oh, four or five decades later,
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.140]   let's take a look and see what's happened.
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.100]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.020]   They have exported collectivism to our shores,
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.620]   along with their cheap Chinese manufactured goods.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.980]   They have exported totalitarianism
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.700]   and censorship to our shores.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.420]   The big tech companies are now doing the bidding
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.780]   of the communist Chinese, and now it's again beyond that.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.860]   The NBA, mass media, we have Hollywood
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.660]   all in the pocket of the communist Chinese.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.780]   When we come back, we're going to have a clip
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.980]   from two NBA analysts where they admit exactly
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.220]   the depravity that they are, I mean, it's unprecedented.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.340]   They admit this is all about getting
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.140]   to 600 million Chinese viewers.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.940]   It has nothing to do with caring about social justice
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.260]   or caring about liberty or caring about anything else.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.780]   Their only goal, their only consideration
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.620]   is getting the communist Chinese money.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.260]   It's a sick, sick system.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.260]   And not only that, we've got an article from newswars.com.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.420]   Pro Hong Kong Sixers fan has been booted
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.820]   from a Philadelphia NBA game
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.140]   for supporting the fight in Hong Kong.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.380]   Sam Wachs and his wife brought signs
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.940]   which read "Free Hong Kong" and "Free HK"
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.300]   to Tuesday night's game between the Sixers
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.940]   and the Zhengzhou Lung Lions
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.060]   of the Chinese Basketball Association.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.780]   According to Wachs, he lived in Hong Kong for two years
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.580]   and supports the anti-government movement.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.500]   He says, "We were just sitting in our seats
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.620]   near the Chinese bench and they've been ejected."
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.180]   There's no pretense anymore
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.420]   that the NBA is not a political organization.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.220]   It's a political organization, all right,
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.180]   but it's a political organization
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.820]   for the communist Chinese.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.420]   You know, meanwhile, we had the NFL a few years ago.
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.420]   They had their kneeling scandal
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.740]   where there were athletes were kneeling
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.380]   because of police brutality here in the United States.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.340]   And they tried to shut that down.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.940]   And as a result, they were lambasted by the leftists.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.660]   But if you shut down free expression,
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.140]   if you do that for the benefit
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.540]   of the Chinese Communist Party,
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.900]   then you're richly rewarded, my friends.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.740]   Don't go away.
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.380]   You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.100]   I'm guest host Tom Papert filling in for Alex.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.460]   We'll be right back after this short break.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.300]   - My fellow Freedom Lovers,
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.180]   I'm very excited to bring you Vasso Beats.

[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.220]   - Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.340]   I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.140]   when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.700]   I sued the IRS and won.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.660]   I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.340]   I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.540]   and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.180]   that they thought might never be solved.

[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.260]   - We sold Secret 12 for four years
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.260]   and it was our number third bestseller.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.460]   We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.020]   you are supposed to rename it.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.180]   That new formula is Ultra 12.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.260]   It's twice as strong as Secret 12,
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.580]   the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.860]   It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.700]   and it does amazing things.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.580]   Supports healthy nerve and brain cells,
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.180]   helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy,
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.660]   helps produce healthy blood cells,
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.740]   essential for proper nervous system function.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.020]   It goes on and on.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.580]   B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia,
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.540]   fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss,
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.740]   depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems,
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.780]   and low sperm count.
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.340]   Bottom line folks, you need Ultra 12.
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.020]   It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win

[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.180]   - As the world awakens to the fact that InfoWars was right,
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:15.140]   that Alex Jones was right,
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.820]   I could sit here and do a victory lap,
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.300]   but folks, we don't have time.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.780]   I don't wanna do a victory lap.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.020]   I'm not happy that I was right about all this.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.660]   No, I don't wanna be a slave of the globalist
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.260]   and live like a Chai Com slave.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.580]   I wanna see the poor Chinese people freed.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.260]   I don't wanna be brought down to their level.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.380]   I wanna see them brought up to our level.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.820]   Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be involved.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.120]   Now is the time to be spreading the word.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.500]   And now is the time to financially support InfoWars.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.700]   And we make it so easy.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.180]   It's such a 360 win.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.900]   We're running a gigantic special.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.460]   In some ways, it's the biggest ever,

[00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.660]   and it's all vitally needed.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.340]   And now is the time to fill up our war chest,
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.980]   to go in to this key year of 2020.
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.160]   So please support us at infowarsstore.com
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.120]   and take advantage of these great products.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.240]   - You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:22.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.600]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.540]   it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.760]   - Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.080]   I'm of course, Tom Pafford, filling in for Alex,
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.880]   who will be back tonight at 7 p.m.,
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.920]   guest hosting on Firepower with Will Johnson.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.760]   So in the last segment,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.920]   we saw Fentanyl the Qycom Dragon
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.080]   tell us exactly how things are going to be
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.320]   if we want to survive
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.880]   in the new glorious Chinese world order.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.520]   You may think that Fentanyl was exaggerating, but no.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.040]   In fact, the NBA analysts on popular TV shows
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.040]   are admitting exactly what Fentanyl the Qycom Dragon,
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   and of course, Alex Jones, have been saying for years.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.460]   Let's go ahead and go to clip eight.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:23.400]   - The NBA is strangling on its own hypocrisy.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.320]   They've branded themselves as the social justice league,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.600]   the most progressive league,
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.160]   we care about everything.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.920]   And Daryl Morey has tweeted out supportive democracy.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.720]   That's something that I think most Americans
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.900]   have a consensus on.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.920]   We believe in democracy.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.160]   And we don't believe in communism
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.040]   and repressive government.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   And so I don't think the NBA needs to be more honest
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.960]   about what it is.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.080]   It's a business, a cold hearted business.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.640]   And there's a ton of money to be made in China.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.880]   That's why every NBA player runs his ass over to China
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.040]   two or three times every summer to get the bag.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.440]   The NBA has been over there getting the bag.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.720]   That's one of the reasons why NBA salaries
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.400]   have escalated to such a high level.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.320]   And so the problem that people are having is like,
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.520]   the NBA, Steve Kerr, Greg Popovich, LeBron James,
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.000]   nobody wants to visit the White House.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.200]   Everybody's very critical of the American government.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   But here we have a communist repressive government
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.240]   that human rights violations out the yin yang.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.400]   - Okay.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.160]   - But Daryl Morey, innocent little tweet here
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.440]   and no one can stand by him for business purposes.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.040]   So quit faking the funk.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.880]   - There's no faking the funk.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.920]   - Pause that for just a second.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.240]   Pause that for just one second.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.780]   So now he lays it out.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.840]   The NBA is being hypocritical.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:51.480]   They're the social justice association of basketball
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.560]   is what they are.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.060]   And now that their bottom line is being affected
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.080]   because you can criticize President Donald Trump.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.640]   You can criticize the United States government.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.720]   You can refuse to go to the White House.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.760]   There are no negative repercussions.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.320]   Most Americans are adult enough, unfortunately,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.200]   in my opinion, to continue to watch basketball
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.400]   and other sports ball teams,
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.440]   regardless of whether or not they support
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.160]   the same president that they support.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.960]   However, when it comes to the Chinese empire,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.640]   the communist party will shut you down.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.660]   You've seen the viral videos of them tearing down banners,
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.040]   tearing down posters, painting over signs,
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.800]   anything they can do to spite the NBA
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.400]   because they are refusing in their minds
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.080]   to go along with the collectivist narrative.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.180]   Let's go back to that clip and see the pushback
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.840]   from a man who also admits it's all about the almighty yin.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.560]   Let's go back to the clip.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.400]   - In the funk.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.240]   There's no fake in the funk one.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.080]   - It can just be a business.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.440]   - There's no fake in the funk one.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.120]   And two, I understand what you're speaking of.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.020]   Well, when we take a stand, as far as in America,
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.560]   Steve Kerr, Greg Popovich, LeBron, whoever it is,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.440]   myself, you, whoever it is, that's in our backyard.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.040]   This is not our backyard, that's one.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.880]   - No, that's where you get your money from.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.640]   - Two is that 600 million people watching Chinese,
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.580]   that's over in China, that's watching NBA basketball.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.420]   600 million.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.480]   Wait, 200 million more than America.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.760]   So now what you're doing is you're biting them hands
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.800]   and feeding you.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.440]   So first of all, stay away from that.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.400]   Stay away from it.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.560]   Because if you're so gung ho,
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.800]   your name will be with Steve Kerr and Greg Popovich
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   when it comes to what's in America.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.640]   Do you tweet a lot of those things?
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.120]   - All right, let's end that clip right there.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.760]   That is brutal honesty from NBA analysts.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.360]   These people are very popular
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.160]   when it comes to sports entertainment
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.840]   and sports analysis programming.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.040]   And both of them, one criticizing
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.640]   and the other endorsing, admit this whole scandal over China
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.360]   is about courting the communist Chinese
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.680]   so you can get their money.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.320]   It's a disgusting state of affairs in the United States
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.360]   where you have virtually every single corporation,
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.780]   I guess South Park excluded,
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.440]   saying whatever the Chinese Communist Party wants
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.200]   is our bottom line.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.920]   You can't talk about homosexuality.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.600]   You can't talk about organ transplants.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.240]   You can't talk about disappearances.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.520]   You can't talk about surveillance.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.840]   You can't talk about human freedom, democracy, liberty,
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.120]   anything, because that goes against
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.280]   our new communist Chinese paymasters
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.440]   brought to you of course by the deep state
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.400]   who for decades have been betting
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:28.040]   that the Chinese would be the new force for the 21st century
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.280]   and only now under President Trump with tariffs,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.760]   with everything else he's trying to do
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.160]   to bring China in line,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.600]   only now are they starting to struggle.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.680]   There've been numerous reports
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.080]   that they may finally have an inflation.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.100]   They may finally have a recession.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.720]   Only in the age of President Trump.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.360]   And meanwhile, these people hate President Trump.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.640]   I'm beginning to wonder,
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.900]   and I think it's not too far-fetched,
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.160]   whether or not these professional sporting events,
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.040]   whether or not they loathe President Trump
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.280]   because of their love of the communist Chinese dollar.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.640]   In communist China, they don't like President Trump.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.400]   They don't like the NBA now either.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:12.600]   It's really an unprecedented series of events
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.000]   where you have virtually every single major American company
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.080]   coming out in support of the Chinese communist empire
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.960]   over human liberty.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.780]   That's what this is.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.540]   It's not them over us or us over them.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.280]   It's do you want to live as a free human being
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.160]   or do you want to be an ant in the giant collective
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.760]   with Xi Jinping, your queen ant,
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.580]   telling you what to think and what to say?
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.580]   So real quick, we need to do a quick plug
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.200]   because this deal, I thought the last deal
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.320]   was going to be the best ever.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.820]   The last sale was, of course, Black Friday comes early,
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.200]   and I'd never seen 50% off site-wide
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.660]   on Infowarsstore.com before,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.240]   but this, Alex somehow has topped it
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.880]   with the everything must go emergency sale.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.160]   You can get anywhere from 40 to 70% off
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:07.160]   virtually every product on the website, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.860]   And this is absolutely vital to fund the Infowar
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.360]   into the next year.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.880]   We need your help, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.460]   Amazing, amazing prices on Survival Shield X3.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.460]   The two-ounce bottle is 70% off.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.520]   And I know Alex says the X2 is better.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.920]   If you look at the ingredients, maybe it is, maybe it isn't,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.740]   but let me tell you, folks,
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.980]   the Survival Shield X3 is absolutely delicious.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.860]   You don't even know you're taking a supplement.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.220]   It tastes like you're drinking candy.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.380]   360 immune defense combo with Immune Wall
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.420]   and Silver Bullet is 71% off.
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.820]   Gut Fusion, which is a fantastic product,

[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.700]   which I've been trying the past couple weeks,
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.060]   a fan of the show bought me a bottle or bought me a tube.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.420]   The one-ounce is 30% off.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.700]   These are selling out fast.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.860]   They're already completely out of the three-ounce tube,
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.180]   so make sure to get it while you can.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.780]   Other great deals, InfowarsStore.com.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.580]   And I don't say this as somebody
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.660]   who's just trying to make a buck.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.420]   Yes, of course, it is vital that we fund the InfoWar
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.820]   going into the next year.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.220]   Make sure there are reserves in the account
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.100]   should the Chinese Communist threat come even harder.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.180]   Perhaps they can ban, banned video.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.620]   Perhaps they could ban InfoWars.com.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.180]   It's important that Alex has the funds to fight this.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:39.460]   But these are truly phenomenal products
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.700]   that for me have been life-changing.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.140]   Before every broadcast I do,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.860]   whether it's right here on the Alex Jones Show
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.320]   or on Firepower, I take two brain force,
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.020]   maybe a turbo force instead,
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.100]   super male vitality or alpha male,
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.180]   and I am good to go with the highest energy I've had
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.780]   in my young life.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.260]   So please, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.060]   This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:02.780]   Make sure to stay tuned.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.260]   We'll have Patrick Howley,
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.220]   reporter of Epic Times and National File
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.140]   right after this break.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.940]   If you are trying to quit drinking
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.700]   or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.740]   You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.500]   I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.100]   I drank and used to party a little too much
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.980]   till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.820]   I realized I needed help to fix my problem
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.060]   before it totally destroyed me.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.980]   If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.260]   and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.420]   you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.020]   They'll immerse you into a 30-day program
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.340]   to replace your old habits with new habits
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.340]   and totally change your life.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.140]   And if you have PPO, private health insurance,
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.580]   the entire program may be covered.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.900]   Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.820]   Get clean.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.900]   Call now and learn more.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.820]   800-506-6740.
[00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.740]   800-506-6740.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:07.660]   That's 800-506-6740.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:12.500]   - China was already running the United States.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.340]   You're like, well, China could never take over the US.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.380]   That's right.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.500]   As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned,
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.300]   a powerful empire can't fall from without
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.380]   before it first falls from within.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.700]   So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.860]   Yes, they're coming for your children.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.380]   They've already taken your speech almost everywhere
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.860]   except pockets of resistance like Infowars.com
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.260]   and Band.video.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.340]   So now you know why I'm so upset.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.380]   Now you know why I'm so angry.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.220]   I saw the producers of South Park on TV.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.660]   They're totally pissed and angry.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.900]   People are like, why are they angry?
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.020]   Because they see all of their freedom,
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.340]   their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.780]   Are you gonna get upset?
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:55.700]   Well, you're a listener.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.140]   You obviously are upset.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.140]   But you've gotta ring the alarm everywhere
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:00.980]   and tell others they've gotta get upset
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.060]   and then take action and let Congress,
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.260]   everybody else know that we're not backing down
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.900]   and we're not gonna sell America out to the shy cops.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.180]   The globalists have been planning to make their move
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.500]   on America for decades and decades.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.300]   Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover,
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.860]   the censorship, all of it.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.180]   That's why they took me off the air first
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.100]   and banned me across the internet
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.860]   because they knew that what we were saying was dead on
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.260]   and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.100]   Well, guess what?
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.380]   Thanks to you spreading the word
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.140]   instead of fastly supporting InfoWars,
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.620]   we're still on the air and we're still fighting.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.780]   So please keep spreading the word
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.180]   and keep buying the great products.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.260]   We're running a massive sale right now,
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.580]   store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points,
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.420]   40 to 70% off.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.260]   It's called the Everything Must Go Special.
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.540]   We're selling out of everything.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.500]   Who knows we'll even be here in six months.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.580]   Hopefully we will.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.540]   Who knows the country will be here in six months.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.740]   I just gut level know we need all the funds
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.700]   to go into the future.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.580]   So we're selling everything out right now.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.100]   Everything Must Go Sale, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.620]   Please visit the store today.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.460]   Again, it's the Everything Must Go Sale
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:06.780]   at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.620]   History is happening right now.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:15.060]   President Trump is trying to remove the swamp,
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.580]   the globalists that have been feeding on our nation
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.220]   and selling us out of the Chai comms and others.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.500]   That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.580]   and said that the Attorney General Barr
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.460]   has to resign because he's corrupt.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.860]   That's because they know that he's getting ready
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.300]   to move against the deep state,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.380]   that there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.660]   Already two weeks ago,
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.780]   the appeal of the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.460]   The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.300]   That means the indictment is there.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.860]   That's why there's so panic.
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.660]   That's why this impeachment's real.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.700]   Of course it's made up.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.700]   Of course it's a fraud,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.420]   but it's the neocon and leftist deep state
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.300]   that knows they've committed so many crimes,
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.820]   their back is against the wall,
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.780]   and they're making their move right now.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.860]   This is the time to be fully engaged,
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.700]   ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.900]   We're fighting for not just our nation,
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.260]   but the world's future.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.140]   America is fighting for its life.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:15.100]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:33.140]   - The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.620]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:41.220]   - Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.100]   Tom Pappert filling in for Alex Jones,
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.700]   who will be back tonight for firepower.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.060]   My guest for this segment and the next is Patrick Howley.
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.700]   He's a reporter for Epic Times,
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.500]   reporter for my website, National File,
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.220]   formerly at Daily Caller and Breitbart.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.540]   This man was the most drudged reporter in 2016,
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.380]   and I believe he's the only reporter
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.420]   to be on Drudge Report on four different websites.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.620]   So Patrick, you have been on top of what's going on
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.580]   with the Ukraine situation, with the impeachment push,
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.860]   all of this insanity.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.220]   We're seeing from the left.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.220]   And just yesterday, we saw presidential candidate,
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.340]   former vice president, Joe Biden,
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.700]   call for president Trump to be impeached.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.180]   To you, what does this mean?
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.620]   Is Joe Biden scared?
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.260]   - I think Joe Biden's terrified
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.660]   because Joe Biden has a very big problem
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.220]   with the Ukraine situation.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.940]   Joe Biden might very well be prosecuted.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.620]   And that's up to attorney general Barr.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.060]   But I mean, it's obvious.
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.420]   It's obvious that he engaged in illegal activity overseas.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.900]   And I believe he committed treason.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.820]   A lot of people believe that he committed treason.
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.420]   I don't necessarily predict in this 2D world
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.180]   that we're gonna see people getting convicted
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.060]   for treason necessarily,
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.060]   but the corruption here is just so overwhelming
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.500]   that it's obvious he could be prosecuted.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.460]   - Now let's quickly play that clip
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.340]   because I wanna hear, again,
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.220]   I think I heard fear in Biden's voice
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.460]   when he was on television saying,
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.740]   we need to impeach president Trump.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.700]   So let's go ahead and play clip six.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.580]   We'll have Patrick give his thoughts.
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.820]   - President Trump has indicted himself
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.300]   by obstructing justice,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.260]   refusing to comply with the congressional inquiry.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.180]   He's already convicted himself.
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.020]   In full view of the world and the American people,
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.380]   Donald Trump has violated his oath of office,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:40.380]   betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.460]   To preserve our constitution, our democracy,
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.420]   our basic integrity, he should be impeached.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.580]   That's not only because of what he's done.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:55.460]   To answer whether he has committed acts
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.660]   of sufficient to warrant impeachment is obvious.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.300]   He believes he can and will get away with anything he does.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.300]   We all laughed when he said he could stand
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.860]   in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.940]   and get away with it.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.780]   It's no joke.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.620]   He's shooting holes in the constitution
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.180]   and we can not let him get away with it.
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.540]   - Now, Patrick, there are so many levels of irony to that.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:25.100]   The fact that he says president Trump thinks
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.100]   he can get away with anything.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.060]   I mean, we've seen the video where it certainly sounds
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.060]   like Joe Biden engaged in quid pro quo.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.820]   If you give me the firing of this man,
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.220]   I will give you lots and lots of money.
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.820]   But can you just break down for us
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.420]   some of the hypocrisy of Biden's call for impeachment?
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.340]   - Well, what was his son doing on the board
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.180]   of a Ukrainian gas company to begin with?
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.180]   Hunter Biden is not exactly an expert
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.420]   in the energy industry.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.780]   He's a crack smoking black sheep son
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.820]   who has never accomplished anything in his life.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.340]   He was placed on that board so that Joe Biden
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.820]   could fleece money and enrich himself
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.460]   as he did all over the world, just as he did in China.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.900]   That's what these Democrats do.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.620]   I was the one who broke the story that Nancy Pelosi's son
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.860]   was on the board of a company doing energy business
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.780]   in Ukraine.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.700]   All of these people, these Democrats are using
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.980]   their positions in the government to enrich themselves.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.820]   That is the swamp that president Trump is fighting against.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.740]   And the important thing to remember is
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.500]   these people largely do not have an ideology.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.820]   They are atheistic worshipers of themselves
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.820]   and their money and their pocketbooks
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.060]   and their bank accounts.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.100]   That's what drives them.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.380]   That's what motivates them.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.620]   And so that's why they get into these massively
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.940]   influential positions.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.700]   And instead of doing anything to help the people,
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.580]   instead of doing anything to help this horrible situation
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.900]   that we're in, they are just going around
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.300]   and enriching themselves and lining their pocketbooks.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.860]   It's absolutely disgusting and it needs to be stopped.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.740]   - Now, Patrick, let's talk about some of these
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.660]   almost incestual relationships that the leftists have.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.420]   Of course, you did break on nationalfile.com
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.780]   the insane news that Nancy Pelosi may be embroiled
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.820]   in this as well as her son worked or was an executive
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.420]   rather for an energy company that did business in Ukraine.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.700]   But I also remember maybe over a year ago now,
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:15.340]   you were one of the reporters who broke the news
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.980]   about Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden,
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.060]   the same son who received this $50,000,
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.980]   I've seen some reports it was $150,000 a month job
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.940]   from a Ukrainian energy company.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.140]   You were the one who talked about him hitting on
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:33.860]   and having a relationship with his brother's widow.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.780]   How are these people, where is the morality of these people
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.860]   or is there any?
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.260]   - Well, talk about bloodlines.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.980]   Hunter Biden had an Ashley Madison profile.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.660]   And when I found this and I brought it to his attention,
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.740]   he said through a spokesperson that the Russians,
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.940]   because they hated him because he was on the board
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.180]   of a Ukrainian gas company,
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.980]   the Russians created a fake Ashley Madison profile for him.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.020]   I pointed out that this thing was based
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.620]   at Georgetown University.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.100]   So, that's where he was teaching at the time
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.300]   or quote unquote teaching.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.780]   So, it was obviously his,
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.260]   but he was blaming it on the Russians.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.740]   That's what these people do.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.260]   They use the political circumstances
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.260]   in order to absolve their own criminality
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.220]   and their own wrongdoing.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:21.580]   And they spend all of their political capital
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.660]   just covering up their own crimes.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.500]   These people can't get anything done to save social security.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.140]   These people can't fix immigration.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.460]   These people can't do anything
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.420]   because they spend all their political capital
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.260]   just trying to not get prosecuted.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.300]   - I think you're right about that, Patrick.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.020]   So, there's an article up at newswars.com.
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:40.860]   The headline is,
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.380]   "Ukrainian President Insists Trump Did Nothing Wrong.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.860]   "There Was No Blackmail."
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.500]   I'm wondering, how long do you predict,
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.460]   you've been following these people, the swamp,
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.180]   you're in the swamp now coming to us from Washington, DC.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.620]   I hope that you're doing all right there,
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.580]   but can you tell us exactly how long is this scandal,
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.140]   this that never was, going to go on
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.980]   when you have the Ukrainian president
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.020]   saying there was nothing wrong.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.420]   You have Vice President Mike Pence
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.340]   saying there was nothing wrong.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.820]   Donald J. Trump saying there was nothing wrong.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.060]   Every congressional Republican.
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.420]   About the only one who is still saying, or maybe two,
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.060]   who are still saying that President Trump
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.380]   acted improprietarily is, or improperly,
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.140]   is, of course, Shifty Adam Schiff
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.500]   and Nancy Pelosi, the 79-year-old wonder kid.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.940]   How long do we have to put up with this
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.380]   when you have the Ukrainian president
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.180]   issuing statement after statement that nothing happened?
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.420]   - Tom, it's so important to have independent media
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.940]   like this show because their psyop is exposed,
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.540]   their psyop is discredited,
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.460]   and so now everyone is laughing at them.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.540]   The entire country is looking at this and laughing at them.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.180]   The president has released the transcript of the phone call.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.300]   Adam Schiff has perjured himself in front of Congress.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.940]   I mean, these people are just lying.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.420]   They're using the apparatus of the mainstream media to lie.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.740]   I hope it goes on.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.220]   I hope it goes on because it is exposing
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.420]   their lying mainstream media apparatus once and for all,
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.820]   just like with Brett Kavanaugh.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.620]   This whole thing is gonna go down,
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.020]   and President Donald Trump is gaining.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.940]   He's raising a record amount of money.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:11.300]   The campaign is just ecstatic that this is going on
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.620]   because Nancy Pelosi is never gonna hold a vote.
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.460]   You know why?
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.940]   Jenny Beth Martin is agitating right now.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.220]   The Tea Party is sending people
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.340]   to every single congressional district office
[00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.140]   of every single lawmaker, Republican and Democrat.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.740]   There is no way that these Democrats in swing districts
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.140]   are gonna go ahead and put their vote down
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.540]   for impeachment on the record.
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.580]   It's not gonna happen 'cause they're gonna get voted out,
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.540]   and Trump's gonna take back the House.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.260]   - And of course, that brings us to President Trump's letter
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.540]   that he sent Nancy Pelosi just recently,
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.620]   where he laid out exactly how crooked this system is,
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.500]   where it's impeachment, but it's not impeachment.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.620]   It gives Democrats the right to do whatever they want
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.300]   and ignore evidence that they don't like,
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.060]   or Republicans have no subpoena power.
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.860]   They are essentially the slave to the Democrat Party,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.260]   which is unprecedented.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.580]   In the next segment, though,
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.900]   I wanna ask you about Fox News, our competitor,
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.780]   the former conservative stalwart,
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.180]   which is now they've got Napolitano saying
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.220]   Trump is going to be impeached and arrested.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.340]   They have a new poll that they're pushing
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.780]   saying that Republican support for impeachment
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.060]   is on the rise.
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.580]   It seems totally fictitious to me,
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.500]   and when we come back in the next segment,
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.220]   I wanna get your thoughts on this
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.300]   because it seems as though without the alternative media,
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.300]   without newswars.com, infowars.com,
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.460]   the Alex Jones Show, Band.video, Firepower,
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.180]   the Epoch Times, National File,
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.420]   all of these fantastic publications and shows,
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.940]   the American people would be left
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.700]   with absolutely nowhere to go.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.220]   I think that, in my view, these people are being exposed
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:44.460]   as voices for the UNA Party.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.300]   So you're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.180]   I am Tom Pappert, filling in for Alex.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.140]   Remember, Alex will be back tonight at 7 p.m.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.620]   Do not miss Firepower.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.260]   He's going to have President Trump's rally all night
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.140]   from seven until nine and maybe a little after.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.980]   When we come back, we'll have Patrick Halle
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.420]   to talk about the demise of Fox News.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.260]   Don't go away.
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:11.340]   - Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:12.460]   more than a decade ago,
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:14.860]   and they've been approving almost all the scripts
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.540]   that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.660]   And now they own our debt.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.020]   Now they own the Democratic Party.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.540]   Now they've merged with Silicon Valley
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.780]   to censor patriots off the air.
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.140]   Washington Post comes out and says
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.060]   they hope that Xi Jinping, the dictator of China,
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.940]   will, quote, "destroy Trump."
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.460]   That's a headline.
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.180]   So Infowars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:40.060]   We have blown the whistle continuously
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.220]   and have been proven right.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.620]   And that's why it's more important than ever
[00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.020]   that we override Silicon Valley
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.020]   and their Qaikom masters by word of mouth
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.060]   and spread the word about Infowars
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.060]   and check out infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.620]   That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded.
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.900]   That's where the tip of the spear
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:59.380]   is continually being forged, is infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:10.700]   My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump,
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.500]   just like you have.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.300]   And my goodness, yesterday's press conference,
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.660]   when they came in on him with all their garbage,
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.860]   the foreign reporters, the US reporters,
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.260]   these little political sellouts, these whores,
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.780]   he just tore them to bits.
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.580]   And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener,
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.540]   it's powerful, but if you see it,
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.900]   it's all at band.video.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.580]   We've got the full press conference.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.180]   We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.340]   It's all at band.video.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.340]   And I just, you've got to share this with people
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.420]   because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.460]   This was amazing.
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.900]   And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.260]   So Infowars, America, Trump, all of us,
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.940]   incredible things are happening.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.540]   And we're sharing the ideas that are gonna defeat the tyrants
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.660]   at band.video.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.020]   And I got to tell you, we've done great video work.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.180]   We've done great films.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.780]   We've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:02.700]   Well, now they are.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.540]   I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:05.380]   Check it out.
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.900]   There's a lot of new features, band.video.
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.180]   There's a reason we were deplatformed 14 months ago.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.140]   And it's because Infowars has been over the target
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.980]   with something like a 98% accuracy rate.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.700]   We have laid out everything that's going on
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.500]   and folks are really paying attention now.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.220]   That means now is the time
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.420]   to support the Infowar more than ever.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.300]   And we're gonna take this thing over the top together.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:35.620]   Everything must go super sale, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.140]   This sale on some items on the site
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.620]   is the biggest sale we've ever offered.
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.020]   40 to 70% off store wide.
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.900]   Many of these are at cost or below
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.020]   because we're offering free shipping
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:52.780]   on every order and double Patriot points.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.980]   Take advantage of the everything must go sale
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.580]   and the funds that come in allow us to fund ourselves
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.980]   in the next year and order new product for next year
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.820]   at infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.140]   That's infowarsstore.com and thank you for your support.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:12.060]   My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.500]   Constitutional lawyers, national talk show host,
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:17.420]   prominent guest I've had on over the years.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.900]   And they're all saying, Alex, it's incredible.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.620]   You've been obsessing on China since you got on air
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.380]   20 something years ago and now it's all coming true.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.700]   How did you know it?
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.380]   Because the Council on Foreign Relations
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.340]   is the shadow government and they admitted
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.940]   the plan to transfer all power to communist China.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.980]   And almost everyone calling me says, yeah,
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.820]   and they banned you because you were saying all that
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.460]   and how Silicon Valley, Google and Apple moved over there.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:45.180]   And it's incredible and wow, you're vindicated.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.380]   You're gonna get back on the air now, aren't you?
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:50.340]   And no, if we don't defeat this takeover,
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.980]   you're all gonna be taken off.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.820]   In fact, you're all gonna end up
[00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.220]   getting put in prison camps.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.460]   They're making their move.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.980]   They're coming for your guns.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.380]   They're coming for your kids.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.340]   They're coming for your right to religion.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.700]   They are coming for your soul.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.020]   Well, you know what they say,
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.220]   you gotta lower your ideals of freedom
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.940]   if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:14.780]   - You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:23.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:42.300]   - Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.220]   it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:48.540]   - Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.540]   I'm of course, Tom Pappert filling in for Alex.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.860]   Remember, I am encouraging everyone
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.300]   to watch "Firepower Tonight" with Alex Jones,
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.740]   co-hosting with Will Johnson.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.420]   They're gonna be discussing the Trump rally.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:01.300]   My guest for the rest of this segment is Patrick Howley.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.100]   Patrick, of course, reporter for "Epic Times,"
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.100]   "National File," formerly "Daily Caller,"
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:08.140]   formerly "Breitbart," fantastic investigative reporter,
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.340]   one of the few real journalists
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.620]   who is still out there making waves.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:15.060]   And Patrick, what I want to discuss in this segment,
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.340]   at least to start, is the situation
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.460]   that is ongoing over Fox News.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.940]   We've seen President Trump either late last night
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.340]   or early this morning come out and say,
[00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.540]   "Fox News is failing.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.580]   "They're going down the tubes, but oh well, I'm president."
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.060]   And we've seen Fox News pushing a poll,
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:32.380]   which I haven't had time to look into the numbers yet,
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.020]   but I am highly suspicious,
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.660]   saying that 41% of Republicans
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.060]   want President Trump to be impeached.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.860]   Can you talk about the demise
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.620]   of this once popular conservative network?
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:46.460]   - Well, I was in the Fox News green room
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:47.740]   just the other day, Tom,
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.100]   even though I wasn't on the network,
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.900]   'cause I'm not allowed to be on the network.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.220]   I won't say what I was doing in the green room.
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.500]   I was doing a little opposition research.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.300]   I happen to love Tucker Carlson.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.300]   I think he's the best person on television by far,
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.660]   and up there with Rush Limbaugh
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.420]   in terms of somebody who I really respect,
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.340]   and I respect their point of view.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:08.460]   Aside from him, Fox News is a travesty.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:12.780]   The lobbyist, the Fox News lobbyist in Washington, D.C.
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.420]   is a former Joe Biden aide.
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.020]   Donna Brazile is basically running the show.
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:17.980]   It's ridiculous.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.860]   The Murdoch sons have turned this into a globalist network,
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:24.020]   and it just goes to show, it proves,
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.780]   that these big corporations are on the same side.
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.700]   I mean, these are leftist, globalist corporations,
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:35.340]   and even though they have a conservative primetime lineup,
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.140]   they certainly don't support the nationalist agenda
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.940]   that President Donald Trump supports,
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.820]   and so that's why they're beginning to turn on him.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.580]   It is so important for independent media
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.300]   outside of Fox News to rally right now
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.780]   and to support Trump as much as we can,
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.500]   because Fox News is not gonna carry the ship.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.220]   - I think you are absolutely right about that.
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:00.020]   I often say Fox News has maybe two hours total
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.460]   of good programming a day.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.900]   Sean Hannity tries his best,
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.980]   but you can tell that the producers there
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.460]   have beaten that man down.
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.220]   There's rumors that he is not going to renew
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.300]   his contract in 2022, so maybe half of his show is good.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.300]   Same with Laura Ingraham.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.620]   You can tell she's trying her best,
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.140]   but she already had one attempt to get her off the air
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.580]   by attacking her advertiser,
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:20.300]   so maybe half of her show is good,
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.580]   but Tucker is one of the few people out there
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.700]   who is completely on point alongside Alex Jones
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.900]   and, as you said, Rush Limbaugh.
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.660]   I wonder, and I think you've talked about this publicly,
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.180]   but I understand if you don't want to go into detail.
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.900]   Fox News has repeatedly put the kibosh on stories
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.860]   that you have written.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.980]   They have, in a way, stolen from you.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.940]   Can you talk about some of the behavior
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.220]   that you have witnessed firsthand from Fox News?
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.220]   Are you comfortable with that?
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.060]   - Fox News is a completely vindictive enterprise
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.420]   that for years has ripped off my work.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:54.980]   They won't have me on anymore
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.100]   because they don't know what I'm gonna say
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.900]   and everything has to be scripted
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:03.820]   and it has to go through the Koch brother sausage factory,
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.300]   but they take my work,
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.700]   they talk about it on the air constantly,
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:09.980]   and I'm happy they do,
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.340]   but very, very rarely do they ever cite it,
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.180]   and in fact, sometimes they will outright lie
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.860]   and say that some other publication did it.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.140]   It is ridiculous.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.260]   Everybody who works in this business knows
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.340]   that Fox News is a vindictive operation.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.460]   If you're on their bad list,
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.220]   they stomp on you as much as they possibly can.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:29.660]   They rub it in your face.
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:33.020]   They are bad, bad people to other people in the business.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:36.380]   - You know, you are really onto something there,
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:38.500]   and I just have to say for some background info,
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.260]   when Alex called me to host the show,
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.780]   he said, "Have on whoever you want.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.780]   "It'll be a great show, anyone you want,"
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:45.300]   and so I thought, "Let's get Patrick,
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.540]   "let's get some other folks, and let's have a fun show."
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.540]   Now, at Fox News, it doesn't happen that way.
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.940]   You and I have a colleague,
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.820]   or former colleague at least, Patrick,
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.820]   who repeatedly has been told,
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.220]   "You're going to appear on this broadcast at this time.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.340]   "Get in the studio, get your suit and tie on,
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.340]   "and be ready only for at the last possible second
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.900]   "for the rug to be pulled up
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.380]   "by a senior Fox News producer,"
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.780]   who then says, "Never mind,
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.700]   "you're not allowed to appear on that broadcast.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.980]   "You're not allowed on our network,
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.300]   "but stay tuned because we're going to have,
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.500]   "we're going to do the same thing to you.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.180]   "We're going to tell you that you might appear,
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.020]   "you might not."
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:22.700]   It's a really disgusting thing that's happened to Fox News.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.460]   Tucker's having to fight for every single segment he airs,
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.820]   every single guest he brings on
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.220]   has to go through 15 different levels of screening.
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.900]   So, Patrick, later on in the show,
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.060]   we're going to be talking about the situation in Turkey,
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.180]   and what's happening with the withdrawal.
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:40.900]   I think you and I are both very pleased
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.300]   to see the troops finally starting to remove
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.300]   from Middle Eastern sandboxes.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.700]   But of course, there's a report today
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.460]   saying that Turkey's dictator, is really what he is,
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.700]   Erdogan, is threatening to send Syrian refugees to Europe.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.780]   And Patrick, I'm sure you know, as well as the viewers,
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.580]   he's been threatening this for years.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:01.100]   Anytime this little dictator of Turkey wants to get his way,
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.700]   he goes out and he says,
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.780]   "Well, if you don't let me have what I want,
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.460]   "then we're going to send millions of Syrian,
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.380]   "quote unquote, refugees into the European Union,
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.460]   "and we will destroy the European Union with mass migration."
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:17.700]   So now he is saying, if any NATO allies
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.580]   try to label what he is doing to the Kurds,
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.460]   and what he is doing in Syria as an occupation,
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.660]   he will release the migrants.
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.980]   I almost wonder if this is not a brilliant move
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.300]   on behalf of President Trump,
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.220]   because he's been threatening this for years,
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.620]   and it has yet to happen.
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.580]   Can you share your thoughts on what President Trump's
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.900]   withdrawal, what is the move behind the move, so to speak?
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.900]   - Trump is shaking the global power structure.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:46.380]   You mentioned Turkey being a NATO ally, whatever that means.
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.380]   It means basically, if Turkey gets attacked,
[00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.260]   then the United States has to go and defend Turkey,
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:54.260]   even though these people don't pay us a whole lot of money.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:59.060]   The fact that Trump is standing up to the war machine
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.580]   is the most significant part of his presidency.
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:04.140]   It is the area in which he's having the most impact.
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.940]   He's kept us out of a big Iraq-style war with Iran.
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.500]   As soon as another president gets in there,
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.020]   we're gonna be in Iran in two seconds, everybody knows that,
[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.300]   because the entire political class, the system,
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:14.660]   they need their billions of dollars,
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:16.980]   they need their trillion dollars from the taxpayers
[00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.020]   to hand out to defense contractors
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.740]   for another long, pointless war like we had in Iraq.
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.660]   They need to confuse people, they need to break this country.
[00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.260]   China, by the way, loves these endless wars.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.380]   They want America to go over to the Middle East
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.700]   and spend all of our treasure and all of our lives
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.580]   and all of our humanity over there.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.060]   It's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.700]   And you wanna talk about Fox News,
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.180]   this just goes to show that there's really no such thing
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.260]   as conservative or liberal,
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.660]   because the conservative agenda, they would have you think,
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.220]   is about going over there and starting constant war
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.980]   in the Middle East, right?
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:50.260]   That's national security, that's John McCain,
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.140]   that's the Republican Party.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.860]   Well, the right versus left paradigm is nonsense.
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:58.060]   There's a war machine, there's a swamp,
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:00.620]   there are bad people who profiteer off of horrible things,
[00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:03.540]   human trafficking, human slavery, okay?
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.540]   And those people are in charge, and the real people,
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:09.340]   the decent people in this world need to stand up to it.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:13.660]   - I think that that is a perfect description
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:14.540]   of what's happening.
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:16.020]   It's the uniparty in this country.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.180]   There is no left versus right,
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:20.500]   there is human liberty versus tyranny.
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:21.780]   That's what it comes down to.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.420]   So Patrick, we've got about two and a half minutes left.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.420]   Tell us some of the stories that keep,
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.580]   or where people should keep an eye out on,
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:30.300]   and obviously we don't wanna spoil anything,
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.020]   but tell us maybe some of the stories
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.060]   you've got coming down the line and where to find them.
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.580]   - I'm paying attention to the Tea Party protests today
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.620]   at every single lawmaker's office.
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.620]   I think the impeachment effort by the Democrats
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.820]   is circling the drain.
[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:44.980]   I'm gonna stay on that.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.460]   I'm also gonna stay on Child Protective Services,
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:50.100]   which has a financial incentive, thanks to the Clintons,
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.100]   to go around and take kids out of their homes,
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.900]   put them into the foster care system,
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.700]   where they're exposed to human trafficking.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.500]   I just got off the phone with a state senator in Arizona
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.140]   who's now championing that issue
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.780]   and saying that he believes
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.980]   CPS is linked to human trafficking.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.940]   So big progress on that front.
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.700]   - Fantastic, and Patrick, tell us,
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.780]   where can people follow you on social media?
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.480]   Where can they read your articles?
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:17.060]   - Follow me @howleyreporter, H-O-W-L-E-Y,
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.940]   Howley Reporter, all one word, on Twitter.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.460]   And I put the articles out there,
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.980]   I write for the Epoch Times,
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.700]   and writing for you people
[00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.100]   is really the great joy of my life.
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.100]   And I'm very grateful to be on the show
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.500]   and to be able to get these articles out there.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.300]   - Well, Patrick, thank you so much for coming on.
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.000]   You, Alex Jones, said it, and I agree,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.860]   you are a legend in this field.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.060]   You have been breaking news.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:40.860]   You are, in many, many ways,
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.820]   responsible for getting President Trump elected.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.020]   Some other time, we can go into the long story
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.280]   of how you completely destroyed the narrative
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:51.900]   and forced Breitbart to become a pro-Trump publication.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:52.940]   A lot of people don't know this.
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:55.540]   Before Patrick Howley, Breitbart was squarely
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.120]   in the corner of Senator Ted Cruz,
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.220]   who was running for president in 2016.
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.740]   Patrick is truly a national treasure.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:02.940]   And Patrick, I wanna say one more time,
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:06.220]   thank you so much for appearing on this broadcast.
[00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:07.920]   - You're the man, Tom, keep going.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.100]   - Thank you, Patrick.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.020]   So you are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.460]   When we come back in the next hour,
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.140]   in the next hour, maybe not right when we come back,
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.660]   we're going to have two clips from Alex Jones
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:23.300]   that we will be airing, so do not go away.
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.860]   When we come back, Alex will be here
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.300]   delivering some remarks.
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.380]   We also, I also wanna remind you one more time,
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.520]   tune into Firepower tonight,
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.940]   because we are going to have Alex Jones live in studio,
[00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:37.780]   manning shotgun for the Trump rally.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.780]   Coming up in the rest of the show,
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:40.900]   we're gonna have Louie Huey,
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.660]   who is going to talk about social media censorship,
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.820]   as well as drag queen story hour.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:47.940]   Later on in the show, I'll have Will Johnson
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.980]   there in the studio in Austin, Texas.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.660]   So you are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.980]   I'm Tom Papert.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.220]   We'll be right back after this break.
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:02.060]   - We are working with Silicon Valley
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:05.140]   to make you behave yourself.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:06.660]   Once we have full control,
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.660]   we send you to re-education camp
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:13.660]   like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:18.660]   Whatever you do, do not visit Band.Video.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:21.660]   Band.Video is evil Americans
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:25.020]   who Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up,
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.260]   like China do.
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:28.420]   (screams)
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:33.780]   Hey, I told you, don't go to Band.Video.
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.540]   I'm watching you.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:36.460]   (laughs)
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.060]   Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.460]   Soon, we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:44.860]   (laughs)
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.060]   Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:53.100]   Do what CNN says and do not visit Band.Video
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.900]   or I have to hurt you.
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.060]   (screams)
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:00.860]   - Do you feel that my style is wrong
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:02.180]   or my substance is wrong?
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.580]   Trying to fact check the president.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.260]   - The deceptive, humpty dumpty troll
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:10.140]   known as Brian Stelter, his little weasel minion,
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:12.860]   Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:15.580]   to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.580]   And of course, he famously said, along with many others,
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   that Trump is the InfoWars president.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.380]   - President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:25.420]   showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say,
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.220]   the InfoWars president.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.620]   - And you know what, it's true.
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.300]   Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew,
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.180]   and my drive and your drive,
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:34.820]   has brought Trump to the White House
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.940]   and other nationalists to power around the world.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:38.420]   And now Trump's openly coming out
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.860]   and declaring war on these globalist tyrants
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.940]   and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.100]   So this is a day of great victory,
[00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:47.620]   and I salute you all, but now we're in the thick of the fight
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.540]   so InfoWarsStore.com for products you need,
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:53.500]   massive sales now, so we can continue on to the future
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.660]   and give these bastards one hell of a fight
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.260]   right until the end, until we've defeated them.
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:05.740]   - You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:10.500]   (dramatic music)
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.260]   (dramatic music)
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:23.180]   Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.860]   You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.460]   Well, so does he.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.460]   Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:39.540]   - Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:44.540]   on this October 10th, 2019 Thursday edition.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.340]   I am Alex Jones, your host,
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.860]   and I'm gonna be here with you today
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.500]   for just a few segments because Tom Papert,
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.020]   the co-host, firepower, Will Johnson,
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:58.900]   weeknights 7 to 9 p.m. syndicated via radio and TV
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.500]   right here from this network,
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.940]   and of course syndicated to everybody via the internet
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:06.100]   at Band.Video is going to be hosting.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.300]   And I just really want him to host the show
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:13.460]   because he does such a really in-depth, great job
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.540]   breaking down world events.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:19.020]   And I think he's somebody that really needs a big platform.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:24.020]   He is ready for a marquee national broadcast.
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.860]   And that's what we're doing with firepower
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.180]   with he and Will Johnson.
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:32.660]   So look forward to him coming up here in about 15 minutes.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.220]   At the start of segment three, he'll be in studio.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:39.340]   I left the screens off here in the news set today
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.780]   'cause I thought it looks really interesting.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:44.300]   And I was already thinking about when I came in,
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.620]   really trying to strip away all the distractions
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.380]   and cut right to the heart of the matter
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.980]   of just how historic the times are.
[01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.980]   And so they hadn't turned the screens on yet.
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.180]   And I said, leave those off,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.300]   at least for the first few segments,
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:04.300]   because I think it is archetypally a lot of things.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.620]   It's kind of like 2001 Space Odyssey,
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.580]   like the monolith, but turned on its side.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.180]   It's also a symbol of what happens if they take us
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.020]   and other independent media off the air.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:19.620]   But again, it's a symbol of stripping everything away.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:24.620]   But I'll move away from that discussion
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.780]   and give you a prelude of what I'll be covering
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.900]   in the next segment.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.900]   We've heard a lot of talk about indictments coming soon
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.580]   and Trump's gonna move against the deep state.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.540]   And the indictments are just a few months away.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:47.380]   Well, I haven't seen Rudolph Giuliani make statements
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.460]   that are that strong until recently.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.460]   And he made more of those statements
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.580]   on Fox News just the other night.
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:59.260]   So I thought I would get into that when we come back.
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:02.900]   Fireworks in October, Giuliani says Biden, Clinton, Obama
[01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:04.620]   to be exposed within weeks.
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.900]   Well, that's the intel, the information I have.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.700]   And that's also sources that we have.
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.260]   And that's why the deep state is moving so quickly
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.740]   to try to block all this out.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.140]   It's why they're panicking so hard right now.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.300]   It's why they're trying to brand Trump as a criminal
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.100]   and basically have an unconstitutional coup against him
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.420]   with these hoax whistleblowers
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.700]   is because Trump doesn't have any other choice.
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.300]   Hillary and the corrupt deep state
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.020]   that have been selling this country out forever
[01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.300]   wouldn't just go away.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.980]   They want to continue their control.
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.700]   They believe that America is their prey
[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.540]   like a lion that's killed a gazelle.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:44.620]   And by God, they're going to finish that meal.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.420]   And after getting away with their crimes for so long,
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.060]   they believe they're politically bulletproof.
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.900]   And they believe that Trump, as I've said, is an anomaly.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.700]   Of course, Trump's not an anomaly.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.500]   All the arrogant globalists were congratulating themselves
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.100]   and patting each other on the back.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.620]   We were building a populist, nationalist,
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.420]   anti-globalist movement that started back
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.900]   with people like Cleon Skousen
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.500]   and of course, Barry Goldwater.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:13.260]   Long before Ron Paul or even Ronald Reagan,
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.340]   picked up the anti-New World Order mantle,
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.940]   which they did a great job overall doing,
[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.420]   at least in rhetoric.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.660]   But we got very, very serious about it
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:23.740]   and pointed out that the CFR and other globalist groups
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:28.420]   were maneuvering China into a dominant power position
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.460]   and that they were going to then export that tyranny
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.420]   here to the United States through the corporations
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:36.540]   that basically set up China as a slave colony.
[01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.500]   So I'm going to first define why China is so important
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.300]   in this system and how we were the first to really point
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.940]   this out from the opposition.
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:44.980]   The globalists have been admitting it
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.740]   in their own white papers for a long time.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.620]   Then we're going to get into Trump calling up the Marines,
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.260]   coming indictments and so much more today,
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.620]   right here on the Alex Jones Show
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.020]   with yours truly Alex Jones and then Tom Papert
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:59.420]   from his TV studios in Wichita, Kansas
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:01.060]   and the TV station that he runs
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.620]   that also carries this show live.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.460]   Please stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.620]   (upbeat music)
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:15.420]   - Band.video.
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:20.980]   - Now it's easier than ever to have Band.video
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.340]   on your iPhone.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:25.860]   Simply go to Band.video with your Safari browser.
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.460]   Then you click the share button
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.140]   at the bottom of the screen.
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.620]   When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.860]   It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.020]   I suggest Band.video.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.380]   You will now have Band.video app on your home screen
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.460]   despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.980]   The globalists think you're lazy,
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.340]   but by taking a little bit of action,
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.780]   you can override them, have the app
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:50.860]   and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.300]   So it's up to you whether you wanna defy big tech
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.060]   and click the share buttons below
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.580]   on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube,
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.700]   however you want, be sure and share Band.video.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:13.340]   - I have harped and harped
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:17.300]   and just really endlessly talked about communist China
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:22.300]   for 22 years or so of my 25 year tenure on air.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:27.100]   And that's because it became very apparent
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.140]   by the mid 1990s that the CFR
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.740]   and other globalist groups were not playing games.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.580]   They were de-industrializing the US on purpose.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.180]   They were demoralizing us by design
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.580]   and they were strategically moving industry
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.460]   and rare earth minerals
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.340]   and all the other components of civilization to China
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.060]   and then making them exempt
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:51.260]   from global regulations and taxes.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.820]   They then put them on the WTO
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:56.180]   and let them basically violate all the rules
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.460]   that everybody else had to follow.
[01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:03.460]   So they've been set up as a globalist slave colony
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.300]   of a billion, 400 million people
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:10.500]   to strategically for major corporations
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.340]   take over the planet.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.900]   So I wanna be clear, communist China
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.620]   is a criminal multinational network
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:21.460]   ruling over the poor people of China
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:23.460]   who are smart and hardworking,
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.660]   but because they have had such a huge population
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.740]   for 6,000 years, they have very low value in human life.
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.700]   And the people have been basically slaves and serfs
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.660]   in that entire history.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.620]   So the communists were just a new form of feudalism
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.020]   and serfdom taking over in 1949
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:43.820]   from the Chinese emperors
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:46.500]   who had had a similar form of slavery over them.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.100]   But it's the multinational corporations
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.420]   about 150 years ago, the robber barons,
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.420]   that figured out how to deploy communism
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:57.420]   against areas of Europe that were freeing their serfs
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.100]   and Russia that was freeing its serfs.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.780]   They can then hype the serfs up and say,
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.620]   well, don't just be free, overthrow your czars,
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:07.460]   overthrow your kaisers,
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.600]   which czar just means king in Russian,
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.220]   kaiser again just means king in German.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.860]   And so it's not that the feudal kings were good,
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.660]   it's that they were being replaced
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.900]   with something that was totally godless, anti-family,
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.420]   and didn't even want a middle class
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.180]   or any merchants to exist,
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.500]   but wanted total centralized control.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.340]   And it was the British oligarchs and the American oligarchs
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:33.340]   that were funding the 1917 revolution.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.180]   So at the end of World War II,
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:38.180]   when the United States saved China from Japan
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.480]   and their invasion that killed millions,
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.040]   our evil globalist government put Mao Zedong into power,
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.520]   and that's all declassified, that's all public.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.720]   And so when you see what's happening in China today,
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.480]   it's totally critical to understanding
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:55.880]   that the corporations want censorship, the Fortune 100.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.880]   They want to get rid of the American system
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.960]   of big middle class.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.320]   They want slave labor.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.960]   They like communist China.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.160]   They're not being dictated to by communist China.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.880]   They put the Chai Koms in power,
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.940]   and the Chai Koms carried out eugenics operations
[01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.060]   against their own people, one-child policies,
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.740]   organ harvesting, putting millions in camps,
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.120]   killing Christians, killing Buddhists.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.700]   They believe that it'll finally be
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.220]   the communist experiment that works,
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.540]   but it's not even a communist system.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.860]   No, ladies and gentlemen, it is a tyrannical,
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:30.020]   just kleptocracy that uses up the population
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.540]   as total slaves.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.300]   But as the world awakens to this,
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:37.060]   it's beyond critical to not just make China the bad guy.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.500]   The people aren't bad.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.740]   It's the ruling class there put in by the globalists
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:43.380]   that have hijacked us.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.620]   They just haven't been able to break our traditions
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.060]   of private property and religious freedom
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.580]   and right to self-defense
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.820]   because we already had those traditions
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:57.380]   and had defeated the British crown in the 1780s.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.260]   We had fought for our freedom.
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.620]   The Chinese never had freedom,
[01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:02.900]   so that's why they were so easily subverted
[01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.940]   and turned into an engine of absolute abject corruption
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.380]   and evil.
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.900]   We'll be talking more about that today,
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.160]   but when you decry the Chi-Coms,
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.780]   decry the major corporations that virtue signal
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:16.060]   and push racial division
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.980]   and kneeling during the national anthem,
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.180]   and America was never great, it'll never be great,
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.680]   and no borders, no walls, no USA at all,
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.060]   and remember that the same sickness that took over Russia
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.820]   that's taken over China is trying to fully take over here
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.340]   and preaching the exact same stuff.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.340]   All Democrat candidates sound just like Mao Zedong,
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:37.020]   and they say political power goes out of the barrel of a gun,
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:39.540]   and Buddha judge says, "We're gonna take your guns
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.980]   "because it's about government having power over you."
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:43.900]   So see, they're moving in for the kill.
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.260]   - And so this is not just a question about policy.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.100]   This is a question about power.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.820]   - Now let's shift gears back to the United States.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:56.420]   Rudolph Giuliani, Trump's consigliore, as they call him,
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.180]   has come out on Fox News and said,
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.900]   "Look, very soon they're all about to be exposed."
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:04.580]   And of course, the Justice Department
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.940]   was told there was an indictment of McCabe,
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.580]   and it went up to the deputy head, AG,
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:11.980]   and they said, "Please shoot this down,"
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.020]   and they said, "No, that was almost a month ago."
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.500]   So we should see the public announcement
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.860]   of these indictments, and what Giuliani had to say on Fox
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.740]   is in line with that.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.740]   This needs to happen, it has to happen.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.680]   Trump must get on the offense,
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.420]   or the deep state will only be more emboldened
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.780]   to illegally remove him from office
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.260]   via this whole ongoing coup attempt we're witnessing.
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.220]   - For years, Obama had a pay-for-play operation
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.540]   in his administration that's disgusting.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.740]   And one of the reasons they're fighting so hard,
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:44.540]   if Biden comes out, so does Clinton come out,
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:45.820]   and about three others.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:48.420]   This goes right to the top of the Obama administration.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.660]   And the administration- - Obama wanted to-
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:51.940]   - I didn't have scandals.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.340]   It'll be the most scandal-ridden administration
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.180]   in our history.
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:56.420]   - Obama needed to be informed. - Obama didn't care
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:57.340]   about ethics.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:59.060]   He didn't care, otherwise it wouldn't have happened.
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:11:59.900]   - That's right.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.500]   - A vice president should have been stopped
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:02.860]   from doing this by a president
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.700]   who had the slightest bit of integrity.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.700]   But a Chicago Paul like Obama, pay-for-play,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.460]   eight times, millions of dollars for your vice president,
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.300]   and hundreds of millions for your secretary of state.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.140]   - Oh, the Planned Foundation, this was all-
[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.620]   - He just bought the offices.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.420]   - Joe, how confident are you are
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.620]   in the next couple weeks?
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:20.180]   We're gonna know a lot more from Horowitz,
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.460]   Durham, and the rest.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.500]   - This is gonna be bang, bang couple of weeks.
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.660]   Now I wanna hit one more big story
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:28.580]   before we go to break and Tom Papert takes over.
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:31.820]   And that's this report that's up on Infowars.com
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.860]   where some reporters went out to California and said,
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.180]   "Hey, have you heard?
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:38.060]   New York has outlawed the term illegal alien."
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.940]   That's in federal law.
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:42.020]   They're illegal, they're an alien to our country.
[01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:42.860]   That's just the law.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.900]   That's what they call you in Mexico as a foreign alien.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.780]   And so we've thought about flying an airplane
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:50.100]   above New York, you know, saying deport illegal aliens,
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.700]   just because it's our right to say it.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.140]   It's the First Amendment.
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.940]   New York and this thought control,
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.180]   mind control board they've created
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.460]   does not have the right to say that.
[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.180]   And we need to fight that and litigate that out.
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.460]   And they need to be reprimanded.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.300]   They need to get in trouble for what they're doing,
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.740]   but they're expanding the censorship we've seen
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:08.460]   on the Maoist style universities to everywhere else.
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.140]   And bowing to it is only gonna intensify
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:13.580]   the authoritarianism of these people.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:17.180]   They're really trying to henpeck us into total submission.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.220]   And if you allow that,
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:22.740]   then we will face the arrest of political dissidents
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:24.740]   that we already see accelerating in Europe and other areas.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:28.180]   I mean, this is a real present danger.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.620]   And these people know what they're doing.
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:32.820]   So here is a clip from folks out in California
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:35.460]   agreeing that the term illegal alien
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.540]   should be outlawed there as well.
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:40.140]   Remember, they just passed a law last year in California
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.260]   that if you use the wrong pronoun
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:45.620]   for all these imaginary different sexual preferences
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:47.220]   that you can be arrested.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.620]   I mean, this is incredible fascism.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:53.780]   - So New York, they're recently trying to make it
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:57.260]   definable if you use the word illegal alien.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:58.660]   Do you think that that's right?
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.700]   - Yes, I actually do agree with that in a certain way
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.900]   because New York is very diverse
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.620]   and it's not only one race or one ethnicity.
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:10.260]   - That's a dehumanizing term in my opinion.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:11.820]   Like in my Chicano studies class,
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:14.180]   we had a whole discussion about it.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.980]   And I think it's used to put down people,
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:18.500]   to dehumanize them,
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.220]   to make them seem a lot less than they really are.
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.140]   And I think it should actually never be used.
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.300]   - Some people say it's like a racist term.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.340]   What do you think about that?
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:28.740]   - I just personally think it's wrong.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.540]   If I wouldn't want it said to me,
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.220]   I wouldn't want to say it to anybody else.
[01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:34.220]   - It has that like weight to it for me.
[01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.700]   So I think it goes with the same words
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:37.900]   like the N word and stuff like that.
[01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.980]   It carries that same effect to Hispanic people,
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.300]   at least in my case, at least.
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:45.100]   - It really is mind blowing that we've gotten to this point.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.900]   A lot of people think, oh,
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.260]   they're just well-meaning liberals.
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.100]   They don't understand.
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:51.700]   No, the same corporations that set up China
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:53.700]   and the communist are setting this up.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:56.020]   It's the same systems in Europe,
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.060]   the same systems in Canada, Australia.
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:03.060]   This is an admitted UNESCO UN plan to feminize the men,
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.780]   to sterilize the population, to dumb us down.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:09.020]   We are having war literally waged against us.
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:12.460]   And until we wake up to the fact that this is conscious
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:15.300]   and on purpose, we don't have a prayer of fixing it.
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.600]   But when we do admit it's conscious,
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.980]   and that we have a right to say no to it,
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.380]   people have courage and we can defeat this very quickly
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:26.380]   because this globalism system is absolutely tyrannical.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:28.380]   It's a bunch of corporations above the law
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:31.380]   who are tax exempt, who don't even pay taxes,
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:33.660]   who are all trying to get us to end fight with each other
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.860]   on race and religion while their command base
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.900]   is communist China, the most racist,
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:41.740]   homogeneous nation on the planet.
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.620]   And speaking of that, later,
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.220]   we've got a special report coming up on China
[01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.700]   that you're not gonna wanna miss.

[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.300]   - Heart disease is on the rise.

[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:13.020]   and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:15.180]   by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.900]   Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops,
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.180]   poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat

[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:10.340]   - Now is the critical time to keep Infowars on the air.
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:13.380]   Everything we've warned of is now being exposed
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:14.580]   and is out in the open.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.740]   I wanna be clear.
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.020]   It's not coming true, it was already true.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.140]   I didn't predict all this, it was already going on.
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:24.820]   Now the globalists are making their move with the Chai comms
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.260]   so it's naked, it's brazen.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:30.100]   This is the point when the enemy emerges.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.560]   It's like before World War II,
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.480]   the Poles kept warning that Nazi Germany
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.500]   was gonna attack 'em.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.360]   Nobody believed 'em as they saw the troops massing
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:39.260]   until it finally happened.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.340]   We're at that same point and we're all Paul Revere's
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.580]   who need to be out there warning everyone
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:47.580]   about what's unfolding because this is the critical fight.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.740]   And thank God, America and the world
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:53.260]   is waking up at the 11th hour, 58 minute.
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:55.460]   But will it be too little, too late?
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.420]   That's up to you.
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.180]   This battle's hot, it's real.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.700]   So spread the word and support Infowars today
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.180]   at infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.380]   But whatever you do,
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:05.580]   spread the word about the live transmission.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:10.340]   - Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood
[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.380]   more than a decade ago and they've been approving
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.180]   almost all the scripts that you see on television
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:17.580]   or in the movies for many years.
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.700]   And now they own our debt,
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.020]   now they own the Democratic Party,
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.580]   now they've merged with Silicon Valley
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.820]   to censor patriots off the air.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.540]   Washington Post comes out and says they hope
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.100]   that Xi Jinping, the dictator of China,
[01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.980]   will quote, "Destroy Trump."
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.500]   That's a headline.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:36.220]   So Infowars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:39.100]   We have blown the whistle continuously
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:40.260]   and have been proven right.
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.700]   And that's why it's more important than ever
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:44.100]   that we override Silicon Valley
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.100]   and their Qaikom masters by word of mouth
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.100]   and spread the word about Infowars
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.140]   and check out infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:53.700]   That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.980]   That's where the tip of the spear
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.460]   is continually being forged, is infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.220]   (dramatic music)
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.020]   - [Man] Stand Up Radio.
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:13.740]   - You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:20.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:24.460]   (dramatic music)
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:36.900]   - If you are receiving this transmission,
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.700]   you are the resistance.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:44.940]   Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:50.140]   - Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.700]   We're about to go back live to Tom Pappert.
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.780]   I just wanted to file a quick report here
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:59.780]   concerning Paul Joseph Watson's article at newswars.com
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:04.340]   where Facebook is now banning the OK symbol.
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:06.260]   Now again, that seems like it's silly.
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.200]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.780]   They're just idiots that have,
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.060]   basically part of a moral panic.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:13.860]   No, it was the Fabian socialist plan.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.580]   And George Orwell wrote about this.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:18.300]   He was at their highest levels of their leadership
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:21.340]   to set up a system where they could arbitrarily go in
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.780]   and start removing language.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.580]   And that they as the high priest of language
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:30.380]   would then decide who could use that language.
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:32.300]   And so this is about AI computers saying,
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:35.180]   "Okay, you can't have Alex Jones's photo
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:38.140]   "or anything positive about him or you'll be banned."
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.740]   And AI is gonna blur his photo out.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.580]   I've had hundreds of people, including Caitlin Bennett,
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:47.140]   send me shots of photos they posted years ago
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.340]   where I've been blurred out
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.420]   or info has been blurred out
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:51.060]   and then they're threatened to be banned.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.380]   Some have been banned.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:55.060]   So this is where the AI comes in.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:57.580]   And then they're always gonna be adding more things.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.100]   They're saying Donald Trump is a white supremacist symbol.
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.740]   They're saying red hats and making America great is evil.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.100]   They're saying America existing,
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.160]   remember nationalism itself is bad.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.460]   This is all meant on erasing the nation and identity
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:14.140]   and you being able to even use basic communication.
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:17.020]   So yes, it's racist to say white free day
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:17.980]   at major colleges.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:20.940]   Yes, it's racist to say whites have to go to re-education.
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:21.860]   We taught they're bad.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.860]   America and the West is now an open air re-education camp.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:28.500]   That's not a word I use to make it sound bad.
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.340]   That's what it is.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:35.340]   Obama created documents where they told the army,
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:38.900]   "Prepare to put Americans in camps for quote re-education."
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:41.460]   And they use the term re-education
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.660]   in official army.mil documents.
[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:46.540]   That's why elements of US intelligence revolted,
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.260]   picked up our information on how to reboot the country,
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.600]   boosted it and we got Trump in
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.980]   because the other system would be total tyranny.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.560]   There is no option here.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.540]   These people aren't playing games.
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.160]   They're not backing down.
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.140]   They're not going away until we say no.
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.520]   Every time you acquiesce to them,
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.500]   every time you battle them,
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.460]   every time you use the language they say to use,
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:10.980]   they are breaking your will
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.260]   and setting themselves up as the controllers,
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.500]   setting themselves up as the arbiters,
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.300]   setting themselves up as the priesthood
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:18.820]   that rule over everyone.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.300]   It's time to realize these are conscious authoritarians
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:24.800]   with a scientific plan.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.700]   Limbaugh always calls them environmentalist wackos.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.500]   They're not wackos.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.820]   They're dominant mega banks
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.280]   that wanna tax and control all carbon on the planet
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.420]   and track and trace it.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.700]   They're coming for your kids.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:36.860]   They're coming for your guns.
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.980]   They're coming for your religious freedoms.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.060]   They're coming for the ability for you even to live.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:43.020]   They're coming with forced inoculations.
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:46.420]   Google is now nothing but a giant big pharma company.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.260]   It's on.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.420]   They're allied with the chi-coms.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.260]   They mean business.
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.140]   They think we're weak.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:51.540]   They don't respect us.
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:52.380]   But you know what?
[01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:53.620]   I respect you.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.460]   And you know what?
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:55.300]   They were arrogant just a few years ago.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.420]   They're scared now and they should be
[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:58.100]   because they're never getting away with this.
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.260]   They think their tyranny is so big that it can't fail.
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.220]   They think it's so over the top,
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.740]   we won't be able to face the reality of how bad it is
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.420]   and it'll be blindsided.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.380]   Well, we're not blindsided because of you taking action,
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:08.820]   because you spreading the word,
[01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.780]   because you praying to God every day,
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:13.820]   and because of you financially supporting InfoWars.
[01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.020]   Back to Tom Papert and his critical report
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:16.860]   and so much more.
[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.180]   I'll be back in live tonight with Will Johnson
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.260]   for live coverage of the giant Trump event.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:22.660]   I'm here taking care of some key business.
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:24.260]   Sorry about the background noise.
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:27.060]   Now back to the live transmission in the ATX.
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.060]   Break your conditioning.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.260]   Refuse to submit and be free.
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:31.460]   Reinvent America.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.420]   Relaunch the public before it's too late.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.180]   The world is counting on you.
[01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:38.580]   - Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:41.100]   That was a special report from Alex Jones,
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:43.580]   who is out of the studio today on an important,
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:47.260]   important mission that shall not be disclosed.
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:50.420]   But I wanna go in depth on Facebook
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:54.820]   removing this okay hand sign as a form of hate speech.
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:57.140]   This, you know, a couple months ago,
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:24:59.180]   Paul Joseph Watson on Summit.News
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.980]   covered me being banned from Facebook
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:05.180]   because again, this, it's terrible, isn't it?
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:06.620]   Are you frightened for the viewers,
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.020]   or for the listeners, I should say,
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.860]   I'm doing the dreaded sign.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:15.580]   Now, this comes not that long after the ADL,
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.180]   the Anti-Defamation League,
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:22.180]   designated the okay hand symbol as a form of hate speech.
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:26.380]   And as we know, ADL seems to rule the world
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.540]   when it comes to this type of thing.
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.260]   So this article is from nationalfile.com.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:33.260]   And again, this just happened not that long
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:37.500]   before Facebook and Instagram decided to ban it.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:42.420]   ADL officially designates okay sign as a hate symbol.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:46.540]   And of course began this ADL designated hate sign,
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:49.780]   the okay symbol, in 2017 as an online troll campaign
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:52.500]   to trick the media into believing it was racist.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.620]   Despite believing, despite knowing, I should say,
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.860]   that the entire thing was made up
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.620]   to incense the liberal media,
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.180]   which the ADL admitted years ago,
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.460]   they admitted, they're trying to troll us,
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.340]   we can't just bow to the trolls.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.980]   So no, this hate symbol is not actually a hate symbol.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:13.820]   So despite knowing this, the ADL declared the okay sign
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.940]   to be an unironically racist symbol
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:19.700]   and included it in its hate symbol database.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:20.980]   This is what they had to say.
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:23.100]   Some white supremacists themselves
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:26.540]   soon also participated in such trolling tactics,
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.140]   lending an actual credence to those
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:30.780]   who labeled the trolling gesture as racist in nature.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:34.260]   By 2019, at least some white supremacists
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.780]   seem to have abandoned the ironic or satiric intent
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:38.980]   behind the original trolling campaign
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:42.500]   and used the symbol as a sincere expression
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.260]   of white supremacy.
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:48.580]   So there you have it, the ADL has confirmed it.
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:49.700]   They are the fount of truth.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.940]   They are the language police, as Alex could explain.
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:56.780]   Now we have Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:59.900]   following the ADL in lockstep.
[01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:03.820]   Even though they say they do not map to the SPLC, the ADL,
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:05.820]   they say that they have their own brain
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.140]   when it comes to banning things for hate speech.
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.780]   They say they make their own decisions.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:12.140]   This casts a little bit of doubt on that, I think.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:14.060]   So this is a very important article today.
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.900]   It's up at Infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watts,
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:18.100]   and Alex just referenced it.
[01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:22.100]   Instagram, to remove photos of okay hand sign
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.700]   as hate speech.
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:26.580]   Users could be banned for something as simple as this.
[01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:28.180]   Nobody take a screenshot.
[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:32.060]   Radio listeners do not ever put your index
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.500]   and thumb finger together
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:36.060]   and put the middle ring and pinky out.
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:39.900]   You are a hateful person if you do.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.500]   Instagram will begin removing photos
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.100]   of people displaying the okay hand sign
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.740]   and possibly banning users who do so
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.860]   under the company's new hate speech rules.
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:51.500]   According to Instagram, we remove photos of hate speech
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.100]   or symbols like swastikas or white power hand signs,
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.220]   states the company's report function.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.860]   This is exactly what Alex describes.
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.820]   They're testing, they're constantly testing
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:06.340]   to see what we will buckle to.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:08.780]   There are already words that are completely fine
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.820]   to say in any company.
[01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.340]   For instance, if you're a car enthusiast,
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:17.700]   you may refer to a transmission as a tranny.
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.100]   But if you say that on Facebook,
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.780]   even in that context, you will get banned.
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:26.500]   So now that we have an entire generation of people
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.580]   who are afraid to say certain words,
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.740]   there's the T word, the R word, the F word,
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:33.980]   so many words, and I don't mean the four-letter expletive
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:35.020]   we can't say on television.
[01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:36.340]   I could say this one on television,
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.660]   but because of my Facebook programming, I won't.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:41.060]   You see, just as Alex said,
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:45.100]   I have buckled to these language police officers,
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:49.420]   the new priests of knowledge over Facebook,
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.740]   Instagram, Google, Twitter,
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:55.100]   and I am supplicating myself before them.
[01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.980]   And it's one of the reasons I think everybody respects
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.780]   Alex Jones, he refused to do exactly that.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:01.500]   When we come back, we're gonna have another person
[01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:04.020]   who has been deplatformed almost to the extent of Alex.
[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.260]   You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.460]   - Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:09.540]   I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:11.380]   when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:12.940]   I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:15.860]   I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:17.580]   I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.780]   and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:21.420]   they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.620]   I can help you too.
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:25.580]   If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:27.780]   There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:32.220]   Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:36.180]   That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:38.740]   - Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:42.500]   but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.620]   Forget bunkers.
[01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:45.380]   You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.060]   You need Survivalist Camps,
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:49.300]   the ultimate fully functional, off-the-grid,
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:51.780]   mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.900]   and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.860]   Bold statement, you bet.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:59.380]   See 'em now at survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.580]   That's survivalistcamps.com.
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:05.080]   Trust your family's survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:10.140]   - My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.580]   Constitutional lawyers, national talk show host,
[01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.500]   prominent guest I've had on over the years,
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.900]   and they're all saying, "Alex, it's incredible.
[01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.620]   "You've been obsessing on China since you got on air
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:23.380]   "20-something years ago, and now it's all coming true.
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.780]   "How did you know it?"
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:26.460]   Because the Council on Foreign Relations
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.820]   is the shadow government, and they admitted the plan
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:32.020]   to transfer all power to Communist China.
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.500]   And almost everyone calling me says,
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.820]   "Yeah, and they banned you because you were saying all that
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:39.700]   "and how Silicon Valley, Google, and Apple
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.780]   "moved over there, and it's incredible.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.180]   "And wow, you're vindicated.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:45.460]   "You're gonna get back on the air now, aren't you?"
[01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:48.420]   And no, if we don't defeat this takeover,
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.100]   you're all gonna be taken off.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:50.940]   In fact, you're all gonna end up
[01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:52.300]   getting put in prison camps.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:53.580]   They're making their move.
[01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.060]   They're coming for your guns.
[01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.460]   They're coming for your kids.
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.420]   They're coming for your right to religion.
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:00.820]   They are coming for your soul.
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:02.100]   - Well, you know what they say.
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:04.340]   You gotta lower your ideals of freedom
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.100]   if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:09.940]   - Silicon Valley thinks you're the dumb jellyfish.
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.900]   They think the West is dead.
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.540]   They think if they censor nationalists
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:15.460]   and patriots off the internet, you'll just forget about us.
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:17.260]   And then they'll be the only information out there.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.820]   Well, so far, that's not been working too well for 'em.
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:22.700]   - Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:25.300]   that the resistance to globalism is alive and well

[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.180]   And then there's nothing the scumbags can do.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:54.020]   The power of America, the power of freedom,
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.860]   the power to build a better world
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.700]   and stand in the face of the censors and the tyrants
[01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:02.340]   is alive and stronger than ever at Band.Video.
[01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:05.500]   But it's up to you to unleash its full potential.
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.140]   Band.Video.
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:09.220]   - As the world awakens to the fact
[01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:13.100]   that InfoWars was right, that Alex Jones was right,
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.780]   I could sit here and do a victory lap,
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.260]   but folks, we don't have time.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:17.780]   I don't wanna do a victory lap.
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:19.980]   I'm not happy that I was right about all this.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:22.660]   No, I don't wanna be a slave of the globalist
[01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.260]   and live like a Chai Com slave.
[01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:26.540]   I wanna see the poor Chinese people freed.
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:28.220]   I don't wanna be brought down to their level.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:30.340]   I wanna see them brought up to our level.
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.780]   Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to be involved.
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:34.100]   Now is the time to be spreading the word.
[01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:37.500]   And now is the time to financially support InfoWars.
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:38.700]   And we make it so easy.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:40.180]   It's such a 360 win.
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:41.900]   We're running a gigantic special.
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.460]   In some ways, it's the biggest ever.

[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:54.300]   Some of these are to cost.
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.980]   We're bringing in some money on some of the others,
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:57.660]   and it's all vitally needed.
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:00.380]   And now is the time to fill up our war chest,
[01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:03.020]   to go in to this key year of 2020.
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:05.180]   So please support us at infowarsstore.com
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:07.180]   and take advantage of these great products.
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:13.140]   - You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.720]   (upbeat music)
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:32.040]   - From the front lines of the information war,
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.600]   it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:41.440]   - Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.060]   I am Tom Paffert, filling in for Alex today.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.660]   Remember, I'm gonna keep reminding you,
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:49.980]   Alex will be live on Firepower tonight, 7 p.m.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:52.140]   Make sure to watch for the Trump rally.
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:55.460]   My guest for the next two segments is Louie Huey.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:34:00.300]   He is host of the popular podcast, Major League Liberty.
[01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.140]   He's a Colorado proud boy and activist.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:05.100]   He has been, perhaps better than anyone else,
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.020]   exposing drag queen story time
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:11.640]   and drag time for children events happening in Colorado.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.440]   But Louie has also, to a very large extent,
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:18.420]   been deplatformed almost as badly as Alex Jones.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:21.000]   He's still allowed to have a couple little holdout
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.120]   social media networks,
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.600]   but he has been completely taken off Facebook.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.360]   And that avalanche started again
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.840]   because of this evil white power hate sign.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.960]   But radio listeners, you know what it is.
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.840]   Be very afraid.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.820]   Never do that, never do that.
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.320]   So Louie, welcome to the show.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.000]   - Thank you, Tom.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.020]   Good to see you again, my friend.
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.620]   - Absolutely, it's great to have you here.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:43.420]   So if you've missed the news,
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:45.860]   the new breaking news for the day is that Instagram,
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:49.740]   of course, a subsidiary of Facebook owned by Mark Zuckerberg
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:52.140]   is going to ban you for doing that vile
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:53.400]   white supremacist hate sign
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.900]   that most people refer to as the okay symbol.
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:58.720]   Now you have been completely deplatformed from Facebook
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.900]   and the original reason was because you did this.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:04.140]   But can you talk about this,
[01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:06.020]   I mean, I don't even know what to call it,
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.020]   this tyrannical thought and language policing
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:11.340]   that you've experienced and that those users,
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:13.860]   those few people who are still on Facebook are experiencing.
[01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.920]   What is your thought on this latest move?
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.380]   - Well, I think what the ADL and the SPLC are doing
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.980]   is more of the same of what they've been doing
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:22.000]   for the past couple of years.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.300]   What they're doing, like Alex says,
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.140]   is policing our language and our thoughts.
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:26.320]   And so now what they're gonna do
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.660]   is they're gonna go after signs like this
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:30.660]   or even saying illegal alien.
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:32.080]   They're gonna use that against us
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.460]   to shut down conservative speech.
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:36.860]   They're not actually, this is not racist,
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:38.640]   this does not mean white power,
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.980]   but it gives them the excuse to shut us down.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.840]   And that's exactly what they did.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.280]   Now you can have Barack Obama or some leftists out there
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.600]   doing the same single right here,
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.620]   but they're gonna be just fine
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.120]   and no one bats an eye about it.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.360]   But since I'm a conservative
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:54.900]   and I'm a libertarian activist and a Colorado proud boy,
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:57.280]   oh, they wanna shut me down immediately.
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:00.400]   And as soon as I was on my way out to Portland last month,
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.220]   well, now two months ago, that's when they shut me down.
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:04.720]   They used that as the excuse.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.920]   They said that I belong to a criminal organization.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.200]   I've never broken any laws.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.440]   I haven't hurt anybody.
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:12.840]   I just use my voice and I don't threaten anyone.
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.020]   I've never called for harm.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:15.520]   I've never called for anything like that,
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.640]   but just throwing this up right there
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.960]   is enough for you to be banned for life from Facebook.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.720]   They didn't even give me a warning.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.960]   I can't even get my baby pictures back.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.400]   I've appealed probably 30 times to Facebook
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:29.920]   to look into my suspension and permanent banning.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.960]   No response.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.300]   Been two and a half months.
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:33.380]   They won't give me anything.
[01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:34.900]   I feel like Laura Loomer, man.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:36.900]   I wanna go to Silicon Valley
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:38.540]   and go talk to the Facebook headquarters,
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.540]   but you know that's not gonna work
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:42.260]   'cause they're not gonna give us an explanation either.
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.300]   They're just gonna continue banning all of us.
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:46.980]   I see my friends list on Twitter and YouTube
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:49.560]   just going down and down and down and down.
[01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.860]   Everyone's being banned.
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.920]   Everyone's being silenced.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.760]   And it's for reasons like this.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.600]   That's it.
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.220]   That's all it takes now.
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.060]   It's absurd.
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:59.940]   We are living in this dystopian future.
[01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:02.440]   We used to hear Alex Jones saying it's gonna be here.
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.320]   It's here now.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.160]   It's actually here.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:06.120]   It's actually quite frightening.
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:06.960]   - Right.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.520]   I know you are completely on point there
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:09.960]   with everything you just said.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.520]   Now, you have been, of course, de-platformed from Facebook.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.320]   And the reason is because you are associated
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.680]   with the Colorado Proud Boys,
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:19.960]   who Facebook considers to be a violent gang
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.120]   and group of thugs or something along those lines.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.720]   But I wanna unpack this a little bit
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:27.520]   because it's an example of how Facebook uses
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.120]   and abuses language.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.020]   Because we had, I believe it was the Washington Post,
[01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:35.880]   put out an erroneous report over a year ago, I think,
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:38.800]   saying that the FBI has considered the Proud Boys
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.960]   to be an extremist group or something along those lines.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:44.200]   Now, the FBI later came out and said,
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.720]   "No, no, no, no, no, we don't do that.
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.220]   "That's not what we're in the business of doing.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:49.640]   "It is not an extremist group," which is very rare.
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:52.280]   You never see the FBI come out and say something like that.
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.600]   But regardless, the Washington Post
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.960]   or whatever publication it was, I believe the Post,
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.120]   you can correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:01.000]   but the Post kept their original article up
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.240]   and instead, they put out a second article,
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.600]   which is now on screen that folks can see.
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.640]   They never retracted, they never corrected,
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.960]   they just put out a second article.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.200]   So then, organizations like Facebook,
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.080]   we've seen major banks do it,
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.000]   what they do is they cite the original
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.600]   Washington Post article without,
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.580]   and pretend that the other one never exists.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.920]   I've seen other publications do this.
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:22.520]   The Miami New Times has done it.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:25.060]   It just seems to be this new way to abuse language
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:28.140]   to pretend like the part two to the article never existed.
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:31.260]   So, can you talk about how this abuse of language,
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.480]   how on earth do they justify this,
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.260]   and what are the real ramifications
[01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:36.860]   that it has for people like you?
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.920]   - Well, first of all, it's very dangerous
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:40.960]   what's going on right now,
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.280]   because the people that read the New York Times
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:45.840]   or Washington Post or any of these leftist rags out there,
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.180]   they truly believe what they're being told.
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:49.940]   And if you say the lie enough,
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:51.380]   they really think that it's gonna stick,
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:53.380]   and for some reason, it's sticking.
[01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:54.660]   So that's why, yeah, like this,
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:56.460]   they're saying that this is a hate signal.
[01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:59.460]   It's not, but poor brainwashed Marxists out there
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:00.800]   and liberals believe it.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.300]   They eat it up, and then they use it in the streets
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.260]   as justification to hurt us.
[01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:08.020]   Now, the SPLC and the Washington Post,
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.480]   they don't wanna retract their statements.
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.300]   They're just gonna double down and double down
[01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:13.620]   and keep hammering away like Alex Jones would say,
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:15.140]   and just keep saying the same lie
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:17.100]   over and over and over again.
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.540]   I'm not a hateful person, but what has happened now
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:23.940]   is I have leftist groups, Redneck Revolt, Antifa,
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:25.740]   all these Marxists, they come to my house now.
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:28.660]   They slashed my tires, they threatened my life,
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:30.460]   and I have no way of defending myself
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:31.940]   because I'm deplatformed.
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:34.460]   So now we have people chasing us down in the streets,
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:37.860]   following us home, causing violence in our neighborhoods
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:40.460]   like they did here at Aurora just a couple weeks ago,
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:41.980]   and it's getting out of control.
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:43.740]   This is how dangerous the situation is
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.660]   that we're living in here.
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:46.620]   I'm actually in the process of moving.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.380]   So if I sound a little echoey right now,
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:50.700]   it's because there's nothing left in my condo.
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:53.500]   But this is dangerous, and honestly,
[01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:55.620]   this future landscape and the political landscape,
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:59.060]   I'm nervous, man, because this is getting real.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.260]   The Cold Civil War is on right now,
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:02.740]   and anyone on the fence that doesn't think
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:05.900]   that it's coming, it's here, it's already here.
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:07.420]   - Right, they're ratcheting people up.
[01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:11.580]   They're driving leftists into a state of utter hysteria,
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:14.900]   and again, people like you cannot defend themselves.
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:17.020]   Now, Louie, we're getting ready to go to a break here
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:19.900]   in a couple minutes, but if you can, just very quickly,
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:21.300]   and then we'll talk about it in the next segment,
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:24.140]   talk about some of the drag queen events
[01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:25.660]   that you have been showing up at.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.580]   It's the reason why they're slashing your tires
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:28.580]   and they're going to your house,
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.580]   because they must defend the drag queens.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:33.620]   Drag queens have a right to have a four or five
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:35.500]   or six-year-old boy sit on their lap,
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.180]   regardless of whether or not they might have
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:38.500]   a criminal history.
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:40.820]   That is their right, and you are a Nazi
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:41.780]   for trying to stop that right.
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:44.940]   Tell us about a couple of these events in two minutes.
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:47.620]   - Okay, yeah, so once a month here in Denver, Colorado
[01:40:47.620 --> 01:40:49.980]   at Mile High Comics, which is the largest comic book store
[01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:52.340]   in North America, they host a once-a-month,
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:54.380]   all-ages children's drag show.
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:56.660]   Yes, boys four to nine years old are dressing
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:59.260]   in women's lingerie for dollars and tips,
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:01.060]   and they're saying love is love,
[01:41:01.060 --> 01:41:04.260]   and they're calling me and my boys Nazis,
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.460]   and they say that we're out there to harass the children.
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.380]   No, we're there using our First Amendment right
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.220]   to peacefully assemble and use our words
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:11.300]   and say this is wrong.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.460]   No matter how you dress it, it's not cute and cuddly,
[01:41:13.460 --> 01:41:14.620]   it's pedophilia.
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.420]   You are grooming our children.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:18.380]   You are taking away mothers and fathers.
[01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.660]   You're destroying the family unit.
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:22.180]   It's out of control.
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:23.980]   And so last Sunday, I was gonna go cover it
[01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:25.580]   with me and my Proud Boys again,
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.180]   and they knew I was gonna be there,
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:30.540]   and they slashed my tires, so I was not allowed to be there.
[01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:33.220]   But I still had about 15 of my Proud Boys show up,
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:35.540]   so I'm sure they weren't too happy about that.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:37.300]   This is disgusting.
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:40.260]   There was also another children's drag time story hour
[01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.540]   in Northern Colorado where we actually found out
[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:45.540]   that two of the transgender drag queens,
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:46.820]   whatever you wanna call them,
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:47.860]   that were reading to the children
[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:49.700]   were actually convicted pedophiles
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:52.340]   and the active prostitutes on Colfax.
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.980]   And they didn't do any background checks,
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:55.780]   but it's perfectly fine for you to bring your children
[01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:57.660]   to these evil events.
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:58.500]   We're here, man.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:41:59.780]   This Marxist revolution is here,
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:01.460]   and if we don't start doing something,
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:02.580]   we need more guys out there.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:03.820]   We need more people out there.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:05.420]   It's disgusting.
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:07.260]   Stop doing things to our children, man.
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:10.340]   I don't care what you do in your bedroom consenting adults,
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:13.140]   but when you're involving children, that's pedophilia,
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:16.100]   and that is evil and wrong, and it's gotta stop.
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:16.940]   It's disgusting.
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:18.020]   - It's truly disgusting,
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:20.060]   and I commend you for being brave enough to do that.
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:21.180]   I mean, you have a child,
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:22.340]   and I assume when you're doing this,
[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:24.980]   you're thinking, "What if somebody brainwashed your child
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:26.380]   "into wearing girls' clothes?"
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:27.780]   I mean, this isn't just girls' clothes.
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:30.260]   We're not talking a little My Little Pony sweatshirt.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.460]   We're talking, you get a six-year-old boy
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:35.940]   dressed like he's a woman of the night
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:38.660]   down in the bad part of town soliciting johns.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.700]   It's truly disgusting.
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.740]   When we come back, I wanna hear more about this.
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:43.260]   We're gonna talk more about the insanity
[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:46.380]   of drag queen events that are happening in Colorado.
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:48.780]   What is being done to peacefully, lawfully,
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:50.220]   politically oppose them,
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.180]   and how you can get in touch with Louie,
[01:42:52.180 --> 01:42:54.140]   who is, again, he's been unpersoned.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:56.260]   He's one of the verboten people.
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:57.460]   This is "The Alex Jones Show."
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:59.620]   I'm Tom Papert filling in for Alex.
[01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:00.620]   Stay tuned.
[01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:03.700]   We'll be back after this short commercial break.
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:10.020]   - We are working with Silicon Valley
[01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:13.140]   to make you behave yourself.
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.620]   Once we have full control,
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.620]   we send you to re-education camp
[01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:21.620]   like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:26.620]   Whatever you do, do not visit Band.Video.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:29.580]   Band.Video is evil Americans
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.940]   who Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up,
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.340]   like China do.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:36.340]   (yells)
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:41.740]   Hey, I told you, don't go to Band.Video.
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:43.460]   I'm watching you.
[01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:46.980]   Ha ha, our system has been adopted worldwide.
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:50.420]   Soon, we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:51.260]   Ha ha ha.
[01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:57.060]   Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:01.060]   Do what CNN says and do not visit Band.Video,
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:02.860]   or I have to hurt you.
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:04.940]   (growls)
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:08.420]   - Globalism was doomed to fail
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:11.860]   if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:14.060]   Didn't I say a thousand times
[01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.460]   that there's no way you're gonna have
[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:17.100]   an authoritarian corporate world government
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:18.940]   above the law that doesn't pay taxes,
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.500]   that has diplomatic immunity,
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:23.100]   that runs around saying it's communist and socialist,
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.300]   power to the people,
[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:26.660]   but then meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.300]   Well, Trump got that,
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:30.260]   and all these other populists get it.
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.740]   Why would you throw away wealthy,
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:33.460]   successful countries and cultures
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:35.940]   just so you can say the communist Chinese
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:37.860]   that David Rockefeller put in power
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:39.300]   are better than everybody?
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:42.100]   That is a sick, freakish joke.
[01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:43.900]   And I will not stand by
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.900]   and watch humanity turn over to these people.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:49.020]   And I beg God for the strength and the will
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:52.540]   to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:54.740]   And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years,
[01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:57.620]   and God is delivering because God is great.
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.980]   Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ.
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:03.100]   And now let's move forward against the NWO.
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:10.180]   - Communist China quietly bought up Hollywood
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:11.340]   more than a decade ago,
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:13.740]   and they've been approving almost all the scripts
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:17.420]   that you see on television or in the movies for many years.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.540]   And now they own our debt.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:20.860]   Now they own the Democratic Party.
[01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:22.380]   Now they've merged with Silicon Valley
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:24.660]   to censor patriots off the air.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:27.020]   Washington Post comes out and says
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:28.940]   they hope that Xi Jinping, the dictator of China,
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:30.820]   will, quote, "destroy Trump."
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:32.340]   That's a headline.
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:36.060]   So InfoWars has been the Paul Revere of this operation.
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:38.940]   We have blown the whistle continuously
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.100]   and have been proven right.
[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.500]   And that's why it's more important than ever
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:43.900]   that we override Silicon Valley
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:45.900]   and their Qaikom masters by word of mouth
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.900]   and spread the word about InfoWars
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.940]   and check out infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:53.500]   That's where the arsenal of our republic is being funded.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:54.740]   That's where the tip of the spear
[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:58.260]   is continually being forged, is infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:01.020]   (dramatic music)
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.620]   - [Man] Man. Radio.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:10.180]   - China was already running the United States.
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:12.020]   You're like, well, China could never take over the US.
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.020]   That's right.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:17.100]   As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned,
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:19.900]   "A powerful empire can't fall from without
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:23.060]   "before it first falls from within."
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:26.820]   So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:28.540]   Yes, they're coming for your children.
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:31.060]   They've already taken your speech almost everywhere,
[01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:34.540]   except pockets of resistance like infowars.com
[01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:35.980]   and Band.video.
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:38.060]   So now you know why I'm so upset.
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.060]   Now you know why I'm so angry.
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.900]   I saw the producers of South Park on TV.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:44.340]   They're totally pissed and angry.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:45.580]   People are like, why are they angry?
[01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:47.700]   Because they see all of their freedom,
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:51.020]   their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:52.460]   Are you gonna get upset?
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:53.380]   Well, you're a listener.
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:54.820]   You're obviously already upset.
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:56.860]   But you've gotta ring the alarm everywhere
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:46:58.780]   and tell others they've gotta get upset
[01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:00.780]   and then take action and let Congress,
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:02.980]   everybody else know that we're not backing down
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:05.580]   and we're not gonna sell America out to the Chyconks.
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:13.100]   - You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:20.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:30.060]   Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic,
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:31.980]   it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:35.820]   - Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:38.020]   Again, I am Tom Havard filling in for Alex
[01:47:38.020 --> 01:47:40.300]   who will be back tonight for Firepower.
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:44.100]   He's going to guest host with Will Johnson,
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.300]   where I normally am,
[01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:47.820]   and they're going to be covering the Trump rally.
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:50.180]   This Trump rally is bound to be insane
[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:53.140]   because of the local city government
[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:55.580]   trying to make sure Trump can't have a rally
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:58.140]   by ratcheting up costs for security,
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.620]   which is a common left-wing tactic.
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:03.580]   My guest for this segment is Louie Huey.
[01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:05.980]   He is host of Major League Liberty,
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.540]   an unpersoned individual.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:09.900]   Louie was talking about what he's been doing
[01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:12.820]   to provide peaceful, lawful, and political pushback
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:14.940]   to the drag queen epidemic
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:16.500]   that's been happening in Colorado
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.940]   as well as the rest of the United States.
[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:21.180]   Louie, you were just talking a moment ago
[01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:24.300]   about your tires being slashed by these people.
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:26.500]   I wonder if you can unpack this for a little bit
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.460]   because this is an event that happens
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:30.740]   where they get four to nine-year-old little boys,
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:33.900]   little young children, dressing up like sluts,
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:36.700]   wearing God knows what, I don't know what these people,
[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:38.500]   these children's parents must be thinking.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.700]   They're sick, demented human beings,
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:42.220]   but they go and they parade,
[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:44.420]   and they dance in their underwear,
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.900]   and they do it for money.
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:49.420]   They do it for tips, young boys dancing for tips.
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:51.100]   This is the type of degeneracy
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:54.660]   that you only used to see in backward parts of Afghanistan,
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:56.740]   and now it's in Denver, Colorado
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:59.340]   at the Mile High Comic Club or at the comic book store.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:01.580]   So tell us, you go to this every month.
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:03.620]   You were telling me the other day
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:05.900]   that you had these people come out.
[01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.580]   You saw essentially the people
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:09.780]   who slashed your tires, correct?
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:11.580]   - Yes, yes I did.
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:12.660]   I saw them in my neighborhood,
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:13.740]   so I went out there to my car.
[01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:15.460]   I tried to put in reverse and back up.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:16.740]   I didn't see my tires yet.
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:18.180]   The car wouldn't go anywhere,
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:21.020]   and sure enough, I get out of the car, look around,
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:22.980]   all four of my tires had been slashed.
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:24.300]   And the reason why they did this
[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:25.580]   is because it's the same reason
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:27.220]   why they banned me off of Facebook,
[01:49:27.220 --> 01:49:28.620]   because I counter the fake news.
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:30.260]   I'm out there with a phone, cameras,
[01:49:30.260 --> 01:49:31.620]   and a crew and my proud boys,
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:33.940]   and we're exposing all the evil filth
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:35.260]   going on in the world out there,
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.700]   and they don't want me doing that.
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:38.640]   They want the general populace coming home
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.540]   being brainwashed, dumb, and deaf,
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:42.860]   and you'll listen to what they have to say.
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:44.220]   Otherwise, we're gonna ban you
[01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:45.660]   just like we banned Alex Jones,
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:47.660]   Louie Huey, Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos,
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:49.020]   and all the rest of us.
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:50.380]   That's why they slashed my tires,
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:51.980]   because they don't want me out there.
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:53.500]   They think I'm a threat.
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:55.460]   Now, if they have nothing to hide,
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:56.300]   then why are they doing that?
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:57.860]   - You were telling me about,
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.580]   you tried to go into this event
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:01.100]   to see exactly what happens,
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:02.380]   which seems to be, I mean,
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:03.580]   if they have nothing to hide,
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.620]   why wouldn't they let you in?
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:06.620]   So talk a little bit about what happened
[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:08.060]   when you tried to just go see
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:11.980]   what was happening in this drag queen child event.
[01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:13.660]   - Well, after the first time that I went there,
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:16.300]   the leader of the whole thing, Chuck,
[01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:17.300]   I can't remember his last name,
[01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:20.280]   but he goes by the name of Betty Pages now.
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.460]   He said, you know what?
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:23.420]   We're not in here causing pedophilia.
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:24.700]   We're not harming children.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.020]   If you wanna come and see what's going on our show,
[01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.380]   if you promise to not be unruly, we'll let you in.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.020]   And myself, my podcast, "Major League Liberty,"
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.100]   Logan, and Keith from my Colorado Proud Boys,
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:36.340]   we said, yes, we want to come in there and film it
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:37.500]   and see what's going on.
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:39.220]   We'll be peaceful, that's fine.
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:40.900]   And they said, no, we're not gonna let you in there,
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.660]   and you can't film.
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:43.580]   What are you hiding?
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:44.760]   Why can't I come in there and film?
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:46.020]   I'm just a citizen journalist.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.580]   I'm not there to harass children,
[01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:48.900]   like they say in the news,
[01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:50.460]   and they tell the other reporters out there.
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:53.100]   They say that I'm coming to harass the children.
[01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:55.500]   I'm there to save the children, honestly,
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:56.860]   and that's what they don't want me to do.
[01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:58.300]   They don't want me to show the rest of the world
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:00.060]   what's really going on.
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:02.420]   They just wanna say love is love.
[01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:03.440]   - Right, love is love.
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:04.300]   That's their new thing.
[01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:06.140]   And love is love, and love has no age.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:07.900]   It's disgusting.
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:09.500]   It's pedophilia being shoved in the face
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:10.500]   of everyday Americans.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.220]   Now, do we have any idea what actually happens
[01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:14.780]   in these events other than the fact
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:16.460]   that there's five-year-old boys
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:18.740]   wearing adult women's clothing?
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:20.260]   I mean, are there videos?
[01:51:20.260 --> 01:51:21.940]   Is there anything publicly available?
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:24.220]   Or is this completely cameras off,
[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:27.620]   closed, standing room only type of event?
[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:29.060]   - That's what they want it to be.
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:30.940]   No videos at all.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.660]   They don't want any coverage.
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:34.420]   There has been a few that have been leaked,
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.780]   but Facebook and YouTube shut that down
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:38.140]   as soon as it goes out.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:40.300]   And algorithms won't even let anybody see it.
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:42.560]   There are, I mean, if you search hard enough on YouTube,
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:44.220]   you might be able to find a couple,
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:46.020]   but they're gonna have seven views,
[01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:48.900]   and it's gonna be buried under 20 pages of search results,
[01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:50.100]   and you're not gonna find it.
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:51.700]   And when YouTube does find it,
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:53.260]   it's gone.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.020]   - Truly, truly disgusting.
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:57.300]   So talk a little bit more about these two people
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:00.500]   who I believe you said were convicted pedophiles
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.860]   who were doing the drag queen story time.
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:04.300]   This is something, it's an epidemic.
[01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:05.260]   It's happened in Texas.
[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.380]   It's happened all over the country.
[01:52:06.380 --> 01:52:07.580]   In fact, in Wichita, Kansas,
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:09.520]   where I'm broadcasting from right now,
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:13.820]   we had a big scandal because they said it was anti-LGBT
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:15.540]   to do a criminal background check
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.100]   on these so-called drag queens.
[01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:18.180]   So they wouldn't do it.
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:19.420]   They wouldn't do the background check.
[01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:20.580]   We don't have any right to know
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:22.060]   because that's anti-LGBT.
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:24.260]   So talk a little bit about this separate event
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:26.860]   that you were mentioning in the last segment.
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:28.980]   - So yeah, it was a library up in,
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:31.900]   I believe, Windsor, Colorado, up northern of Denver,
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.960]   and they were doing just a one-time event,
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:37.100]   as far as I know, but we actually exposed it.
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:39.140]   I wanna say a special thanks to David Huntwork.
[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:41.340]   He leads a Patriot group out here in Colorado.
[01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:43.720]   I think it's MAGA Trump, Colorado.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:47.340]   And they actually exposed two actual known prostitutes
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:51.540]   from Colfax, a transgender drag queen, whatever,
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:53.020]   but both of them have been charged
[01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:54.900]   with sex crimes against children.
[01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:56.660]   There was no background check performed,
[01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:59.460]   which means they're willingly doing this
[01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:01.140]   and knowingly fully doing this,
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:03.940]   or they're lying and they're okay with it.
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:06.140]   I mean, you see AOC out there the other day saying,
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:07.520]   "We need to abolish prisons,"
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:09.300]   and this is getting out of control.
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:11.540]   The leftists, can you imagine this?
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:13.440]   All they stand for is lawlessness,
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.620]   and they're taking our children.
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:16.940]   The state actually owns our children now,
[01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:20.100]   and they're pushing convicted sex offenders on our children,
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:21.620]   and they're dancing around in clothes,
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:23.400]   teaching our kids how to twerk.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:24.500]   It's just out of control.
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.220]   People need to start standing up against this.
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:27.860]   I can't be the only guy.
[01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:29.660]   We need some help out here.
[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:30.480]   - You're right.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:32.220]   All across the country, people need to, again,
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:34.580]   legally, lawfully, peacefully, politically
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:35.700]   stand up against this.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.460]   And if you have these events happening,
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:39.220]   it is your right to stand on the sidewalk
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:41.540]   on public property and say that you disagree
[01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:42.380]   with what's happening.
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.320]   That needs to be happening all across the country,
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.720]   exactly what you are doing.
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:47.700]   So, Louie, I wanna definitely hear in a couple minutes,
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:49.060]   we're gonna have you say a few places
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:51.380]   people can still find you, but briefly,
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.340]   you also had a run-in with Antifa
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:55.500]   that resulted in, I believe, some assaults.
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.600]   There's multiple people that are facing criminal charges,
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:58.700]   or maybe they've already been convicted.
[01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:00.900]   Can you tell us about that?
[01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:03.500]   - Are you talking about our event last September?
[01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:04.700]   - I am. - So, yes.
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:06.780]   About a year ago, I held a rally
[01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:08.100]   at the Denver Capitol building
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:11.740]   called the Internet Rally Censorship of Conservatives.
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:13.260]   We were rallying against that,
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:15.720]   and there was about 40 Antifa that showed up.
[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.800]   And they were on the street down there on Broadway
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.040]   in downtown Denver yelling all these hateful things
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.880]   about how I'm a white supremacist, I'm a Nazi,
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:26.200]   and I hate LGBTQs and minorities.
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:28.240]   Well, I'm a minority, I'm Hispanic,
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.900]   I'm not a white supremacist.
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:32.360]   Anyways, seven Antifa members that day
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:34.680]   were in fact arrested because they split open
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.760]   four of my friends' heads with metal batons
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:38.480]   and attacked police officers.
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:40.120]   It was a complete media blackout.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:41.720]   The only thing Colorado media said
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:44.340]   was that we held a hate rally at the Capitol.
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:46.720]   Not a mention of the fact that seven little Marxists
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:49.340]   went to jail because they were attacking police officers
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:50.760]   and my friends with metal batons.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.640]   I mean, split their heads open.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.960]   Not a mention of it on the news.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:58.280]   And only one of these seven Antifa members.
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:54:59.880]   Yeah, it was, and Tom was there, thank you.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.160]   Tom was one of my speakers.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:03.520]   Oh, they hated you. (laughs)
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:04.920]   Oh, I love you, Tom. - See, I had never
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:07.000]   faced Antifa before, and I didn't realize
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.040]   that if you antagonize, I mean,
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.640]   the violence happened before I was ever there,
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:11.840]   but everybody else was just saying,
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.600]   yeah, America, stop the censorship,
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:15.160]   put Alex Jones back on Facebook.
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:17.160]   And I was there saying that Antifa
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:19.280]   is the paramilitary wing of the Democrat Party,
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.080]   which is completely true in my view,
[01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:23.240]   but they were not happy about that.
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.840]   And at one point in that event,
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.840]   the police got everybody together and said,
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:29.200]   if there is one more incident of violence that,
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:31.320]   by the way, Antifa was causing,
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:34.560]   I did not see a single Proud Boy or security person there
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.480]   from our side being violent,
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:39.520]   but if there is one more violent incident,
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:41.360]   then the rally was going to be called off.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.160]   I mean, we had Antifa, the police gave us an escort
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.800]   out of the area, Antifa was embedded in there.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.400]   It was like demons, these people would get out of their car
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.680]   because police stopped traffic,
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:52.560]   and these people get out of their car,
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.600]   screw you, Nazi scum, screw you,
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.120]   and then you walk down the street,
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:58.120]   and it's like the demon jumped to another body
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:01.160]   because another person in another car two blocks away
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.120]   just picks up where that person left off.
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.440]   Nazi scum, you have to die, get out of my city.
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.600]   Denver doesn't want you, it was almost unfathomable
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:11.680]   to see everything Alex Jones talks about
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:16.000]   being proven exactly 100% correct with my own eyes.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:16.840]   It was disturbing.
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:19.760]   So, Louie, where can people still find you?
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.480]   I know you still have some social media.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:23.960]   Please tell folks where they can watch what you're doing,
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.640]   where they can watch Major League Liberty,
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:28.440]   and where they can support you legally, lawfully,
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.880]   politically, peacefully, when it comes to standing up
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:33.960]   against this degeneracy from the left.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:37.160]   - Okay, well, my podcast, Major League Liberty,
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:38.800]   you can still find us on Facebook.
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:41.640]   We're running on fumes because we started late in 2016,
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:43.320]   right when those algorithms really started hitting,
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:45.320]   so they never really let us grow that much.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:47.200]   When we first started, we'd hit a million views
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.840]   in like five minutes, now we're lucky to get 2,000 views.
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:52.200]   But you can still find my podcast on Facebook,
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.720]   Major League Liberty.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:55.960]   You can find me and my podcast on Twitter.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:58.360]   I'm @RealLouieHuey.
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.520]   We're also on YouTube, we're on Mines,
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:03.280]   we're on Gab, we're on Parler, and we're on Miwi,
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:04.800]   and we're not going anywhere.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.760]   - Fantastic, I love that you're still willing to fight
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.640]   against the scum, even after everything they've done to you,
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.760]   the threats of violence, the actual violence,
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.440]   the destruction of property.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:17.200]   You are a fighter, my friend.
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:18.700]   Thank you for being out there.
[01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:21.640]   - Always, I'm not going anywhere, but yep,
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.840]   you see what I deal with on a day-to-day basis.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:26.000]   I'm not going anywhere, I'm not scared of you.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.360]   I'm scared of the New World Order, but not Antifa.
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:29.320]   (Tom laughs)
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.160]   Thanks, Tom.
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:31.800]   - That's exactly right, thank you, Louie.
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.920]   Everyone, you're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.600]   My name is Tom Paffert.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.640]   In the next segment, we're going to have,
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:40.880]   or maybe next hour, we're going to have Will Johnson,
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:43.320]   my co-host for Firepower.
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.640]   He's going to be hosting with Alex tonight,
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:46.760]   covering the Trump rally.
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.280]   We're gonna give you a taste of what Firepower is all about
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:50.880]   and talk about the news of the day.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:52.360]   Once again, I'm Tom Paffert.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.060]   Stay tuned, we'll be right back after this break.
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:59.000]   - The globalists have been planning to make their move
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.320]   on America for decades and decades.
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.120]   Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover,
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:05.680]   the censorship, all of it.
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.000]   That's why they took me off the air first
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.920]   and banned me across the internet,
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.680]   because they knew that what we were saying was dead on
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:15.080]   and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:15.920]   Well, guess what?
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:17.200]   Thanks to you spreading the word
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:18.960]   instead of fastly supporting Infowars,
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:21.440]   we're still on the air and we're still fighting.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:23.600]   So please keep spreading the word
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:25.040]   and keep buying the great products.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:27.080]   We're running a massive sale right now,

[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.400]   Hopefully we will.
[01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:41.360]   Who knows, the country will be here in six months.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:43.560]   I just gut level know we need all the funds
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:44.560]   to go into the future.

[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:59.240]   - Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:00.600]   - Alex, God bless you.
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:03.040]   I have an idea for a new Infowars t-shirt.
[01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:04.680]   Instead of this is your brain,
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:06.240]   this is your brain on drugs,
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:09.000]   this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:09.840]   - Ooh, yeah.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:11.040]   - Showing your brain getting fried.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:12.880]   Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:13.840]   Totally changed my life.
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:17.200]   I use Turbo Force, Body Ease, Alpha Power, Brain Force,
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:20.560]   Fish Oil, Ultra 12 daily, X2 every several days now.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.880]   What I've found is really combining them
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:26.640]   is a totally synergistic and transcendent feeling
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:28.280]   that I get by combining all your products.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.800]   And I just wanna urge all your listeners
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.680]   who haven't tried 'em, I just wanna say why not?
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.160]   - Well, you're right that all of these things
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:35.720]   are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric,
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.920]   or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil,
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:39.960]   or whether it's the DNA Force with the CoQ10
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.480]   and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[01:59:41.480 --> 01:59:42.960]   All of these are things that are like
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:44.080]   rocket fuel in the body.
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:45.760]   You take these bases together,
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.200]   then you have your foundation.
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:49.000]   Now you can build the big, strong temple.
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.440]   With these products I take,
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:51.760]   when I religiously remember to take 'em,
[01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:53.000]   it makes my life so much better.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.760]   And then it funds the information war,
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:55.800]   which is so critical.
[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:57.520]   Thank you so much, God bless you.
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:02.560]   - You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:08.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:18.360]   He aligns himself with the truth,
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:21.320]   and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:24.040]   You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:28.080]   - Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:30.320]   I'm Tom Paffert, filling in for Alex,
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:32.800]   who will be back tonight, 7 p.m.,
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:35.560]   co-hosting with Will Johnson on Firepower
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.880]   to discuss the Trump rally.
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:40.400]   You know, this has been an amazing opportunity,
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:41.600]   and I have to thank Alex and the crew
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.040]   for doing such a phenomenal job.
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:44.560]   But I also have to thank the audience
[02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:45.960]   for making this broadcast,
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:48.920]   this entire InfoWars platform possible.
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:50.520]   Band.video possible,
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:53.160]   Firepower with me and Will Johnson possible.
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:56.240]   You are, as Alex says, the driving force
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:58.800]   behind the tip of the spear.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.160]   And I just want to remind you that right now,
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.480]   this is possibly, I mean,
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:05.560]   I don't know how Alex keeps doing these mega sales.
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:08.600]   This one may be the biggest in InfoWars history,
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:12.280]   where everything site-wide for the everything must go sale
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:17.280]   is between 40 to 70% off on dozens and dozens of products.
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:20.520]   This is the big push to fund InfoWars
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:21.520]   through the end of the year
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:24.120]   and through the first few months of next year.
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:27.080]   And they're not doing the bad products.
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:28.840]   A lot of folks, when they see a sale like this,
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.680]   they say, "Oh, okay, they're getting rid of the stuff
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:31.520]   "that nobody likes."
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:34.120]   But no, this is Survival Shield X3,
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:37.640]   the two-ounce bottle, 70% off.
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:40.360]   And I cannot say enough nice things about that product.
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:41.200]   It tastes delicious.
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:42.480]   It's like liquid candy.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:45.480]   360 immune defense combo with immune wall
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:48.560]   and silver bullet is only 19.95.
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:51.840]   That's 71% off.
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:52.880]   Unbelievable price.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:55.200]   Silver bullet is unbelievably effective.
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:58.160]   I use it or another product from InfoWarsStore.com
[02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:00.520]   every single time I travel to keep myself healthy.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:02.120]   Gut Fusion, 50% off.
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:05.640]   You can get the Survival Shield X3 in the one-ounce bottle,
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:08.840]   60% off if you wanna start with a lower quantity.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:11.560]   You've got Ultimate Fission Krill Oils, 25% off.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:12.960]   Super Silver Skin Cream,
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:15.160]   the one ounce is all that's left, folks.
[02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:16.600]   And I believe that stuff works.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:18.720]   A fan bought it for me a few weeks ago
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:20.400]   and it is doing wonders.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:22.920]   But it's 30% off the one-ounce bottle.
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.080]   It's selling out fast.
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:27.320]   The three ounce is already gone, no longer available.
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:28.400]   And folks, one of the things
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.040]   that I don't think Alex has stressed is
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.000]   there's no guarantee any of these phenomenal products,
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.400]   these life-changing products,
[02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:37.080]   there's no guarantee they're going to be back
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:38.040]   before the end of the year.
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:39.880]   So if you wanna get a Christmas present
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:43.520]   at an unbelievable price, now is the time to do it.
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.080]   From my understanding, according to Alex,
[02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:47.080]   a lot of these contracts, they're not expecting
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:50.720]   the next delivery of these products until next year.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:53.640]   So if you want to get it now is the time.
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:58.640]   Tons and tons of fantastic deals at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:02.040]   And I can't say enough nice things about these products.
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:03.480]   Brain Force has been phenomenal.
[02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:05.360]   Super Male Vitality has been phenomenal.
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:07.440]   Survival Shield X3 has been phenomenal.
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:08.440]   X2 is great.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:11.680]   You barely even need a drop of it to get the full effect.
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:13.360]   B12, amazing.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:15.000]   Pollen Block, amazing.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.080]   I live in a very old building.
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.720]   I have an Alexa Pure Air Purifier,
[02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:22.960]   and it has changed my quality of life
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:24.840]   living in the old building.
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:27.920]   These are unbelievable products that you can right now
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:31.480]   get at an unbelievable price for a very limited time.
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:33.320]   These supplies will not last.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:36.720]   Infowarsstore.com.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:39.280]   When we come back, we're going to have Will Johnson,
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:43.080]   who I host Firepower with every single weekday night
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:46.160]   from 7 p.m. until 9 p.m., except tonight,
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:48.920]   you're going to get Will and Alex Jones.
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:50.640]   So Will and I are going to talk a little bit
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:52.280]   about the news of the day.
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.160]   We might look at some clips together,
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.240]   and we are, of course, going to tell you
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:58.600]   about Firepower, where to watch it, when to watch it.
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.520]   And I have to say again, thank you to Infowarsstore.com
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:06.040]   for sponsoring Firepower and making that possible.
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:08.040]   So Alex will be back in studio tomorrow,
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.320]   but again, yes, you can still catch Alex live today,
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:16.320]   7 p.m., band.video on Firepower.
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:17.440]   As I said, when we come back,
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:19.400]   it's going to be myself and Will Johnson.
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.560]   We're going to talk about everything that's going on today,
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.240]   but I just have to reiterate,
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:28.240]   you have to get these amazing sales while they last.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:30.120]   I know everybody likes a good sale.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:31.800]   Maybe you're gonna wait for the next one.
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:32.640]   Good luck.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:34.720]   The products may no longer be there.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:38.020]   That's just the facts behind this state
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:39.520]   in the information war.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:43.800]   This important juncture is when we need your support.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.640]   This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:48.080]   I'm Tom Pappert filling in for Alex.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:50.200]   We're getting ready to go out to break.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:52.600]   When we come back, I'll be joined by Will Johnson,
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:56.960]   who will be in studio in Austin, Texas.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.960]   Don't go away.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:58.880]   Stay tuned.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:02.200]   We'll be back in just one short minute.
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:07.280]   - History is happening right now.
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:10.740]   President Trump is trying to remove the swamp,
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:13.280]   the globalists that have been feeding on our nation
[02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:15.900]   and selling us out to the Chai Koms and others.
[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:18.160]   That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:20.240]   and said that the Attorney General Barr
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:23.160]   has to resign because he's corrupt.
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:26.520]   That's because they know that he's getting ready
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.000]   to move against the deep state,
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.880]   that there are sealed indictments
[02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.040]   against McCabe and others.
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.340]   Already two weeks ago,
[02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:37.460]   the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[02:05:37.460 --> 02:05:40.140]   The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:42.000]   That means the indictment is there.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.540]   That's why there's so panic.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:45.340]   That's why this impeachment's real.
[02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:46.380]   Of course it's made up.
[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:47.380]   Of course it's a fraud,
[02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:50.100]   but it's the neocon and leftist deep state
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:51.980]   that knows they've committed so many crimes.
[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:53.500]   Their back is against the wall
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.460]   and they're making their move right now.
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:59.420]   This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:01.580]   We're fighting for not just our nation,
[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:02.940]   but the world's future.
[02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:04.820]   America is fighting for its life.
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:06.780]   - We've got it.
[02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:09.360]   (upbeat music)
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:15.300]   - Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:20.820]   It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.420]   from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:27.580]   - Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:29.780]   I'm Tom Paffert filling in for Alex today.
[02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:34.280]   Typically you can find me on Firepower with Will Johnson
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:37.620]   every single weekday night from seven until 9 p.m. today.
[02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:39.820]   It'll be Alex with Will Johnson.
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:41.880]   And Will, of course, is our guest
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:43.060]   for the next two segments.
[02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:45.740]   Thank you so much, Will, for coming in early today.
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:46.580]   I know how it is.
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:48.140]   We do this night show and then all of a sudden
[02:06:48.140 --> 02:06:49.580]   somebody's telling you to get there early.
[02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:50.700]   So thanks for coming on.
[02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:52.020]   I really appreciate it.
[02:06:52.020 --> 02:06:52.860]   - No problem, Tom.
[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:53.940]   I'm happy to be here.
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:57.900]   - So Will, before I wanna talk about Firepower
[02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:00.140]   and kind of what we're doing every single night,
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.700]   it's a little bit different format.
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:04.460]   We run lots of clips, have some phenomenal interviews.
[02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:06.300]   It's been a great pleasure to do that with you.
[02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.760]   But there's a new story.
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:11.900]   It's on nationalfile.com as well as infowars.com.
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:14.540]   It's about a British college.
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:17.880]   And now the Sheffield University Student Union
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:21.020]   has banned white students from participating
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:23.660]   in anti-racism meetings.
[02:07:23.660 --> 02:07:27.140]   The idea is that only what they call BME,
[02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:29.580]   black and minority ethnic students,
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:31.780]   will be allowed to attend the meetings
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:35.180]   and share their views about how to turn Sheffield SU
[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:39.180]   from being non-racist to actively anti-racist.
[02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:42.340]   Is this, what is the logic here, Will?
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:44.420]   I mean, can you wrap your brain around this?
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:45.660]   It makes no sense to me.
[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:49.220]   - I'm trying to wrap my brain around what you just said.
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:52.820]   You know, it kind of reminds me when BLM had their event
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:54.540]   and there was white people there
[02:07:54.540 --> 02:07:56.140]   and there was white people in the front of the line
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:58.420]   and they told the white people to get in the back.
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:07:59.780]   They said, 'cause it's not for them,
[02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:02.380]   but yet you still have white people participating.
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:03.860]   This is ridiculous.
[02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:07.820]   Why in the world would they have such a meeting
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:09.920]   if they're not gonna include the people
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:13.420]   that they say are the problem, right?
[02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:14.380]   - That's exactly right.
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:16.560]   I mean, it makes no sense whatsoever.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.660]   I mean, you would think that the white students
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:20.380]   should be the first one to be there.
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:21.780]   This is the same college, Will.
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:22.940]   We saw another article,
[02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:24.980]   it was on National File earlier this week.
[02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:26.860]   They're forcing all students
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:29.580]   to attend climate change seminars.
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:30.660]   So that way they can learn,
[02:08:30.660 --> 02:08:33.360]   I guess they're going to be lectured to by Greta Thunberg.
[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:35.500]   So to recap, we have white people not allowed
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:37.220]   at the anti-racism meetings
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:39.380]   and all students are going to be forced
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:43.240]   to attend meetings or classes on climate change.
[02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:45.580]   I mean, Will, I know that you've got children
[02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:48.180]   that are getting ready to go to college in college.
[02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:50.600]   What are you doing and what can viewers do
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:52.380]   to inoculate their children
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:55.300]   against this type of globalist claptrap?
[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:57.700]   - You know, one thing a lot of parents have been doing
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:08:59.700]   have been homeschooling.
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:01.460]   I know it's kind of different,
[02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:04.500]   but you can even do college from home now.
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:07.420]   So it's completely different environment.
[02:09:07.420 --> 02:09:10.120]   That's the only way you can protect your children,
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:12.180]   the youth from getting brainwashed
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:14.780]   by these socialist liberals
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.740]   that have taken over the universities.
[02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:20.780]   And it's obvious that the universities have an agenda.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:23.420]   They have this agenda to change everyone's mind.
[02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:26.560]   So when they become older and they go out into society,
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:28.780]   that they will have this mindset
[02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:31.140]   to believe a certain narrative.
[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:33.780]   And the best way to get around all that
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:35.620]   is to homeschool your children.
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:38.120]   And then you have leftists, they get upset with you
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:39.620]   if you want to homeschool your children
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:41.820]   because, oh, you're not allowing us
[02:09:41.820 --> 02:09:44.900]   to indoctrinate your children, you're bad.
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:46.260]   We want to indoctrinate them
[02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:47.820]   so they'll have a certain belief
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:50.900]   instead of encouraging people to think for themselves.
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:52.700]   And then they have the audacity, the nerve,
[02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:55.180]   they constantly say that we're teaching children
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:56.300]   to think for themselves,
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:59.100]   and yet they turn around and indoctrinate them.
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.180]   It's insane, really.
[02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.020]   - It truly is.
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:03.640]   And Will, I'm so glad you brought that up
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:06.180]   because I think that is the best way to fight back
[02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:08.140]   against this type of brainwashing
[02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:11.420]   is to have a good 12 years of telling your children,
[02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:15.880]   or not just telling, but teaching and instilling good values,
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:18.420]   Christian values, American values.
[02:10:18.420 --> 02:10:20.980]   So that way, if they do, if they want to become a doctor
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:22.700]   or a dentist or anything that you have
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:26.660]   to go to a university for, they have years behind them.
[02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:29.580]   It's not going to be erased in four short years
[02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:31.980]   of a college university.
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:34.040]   So, Will, I'm wondering, I mean, this is obviously
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.700]   the Sheffield Student Union story.
[02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:37.660]   It's part of this whole narrative
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:40.100]   that white people are the worst on earth.
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:43.460]   And you and I, I mean, I think that we're proof
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:47.700]   that there is no animosity, there is no racial hatred.
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:49.020]   Or maybe there is, you know, there's what,
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:51.540]   50 guys in the KKK somewhere off in Alabama
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:52.680]   or something like that.
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:54.880]   But for the most part, there is no racial animosity
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:55.720]   on this show.
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:57.660]   We host a show every single night together
[02:10:57.660 --> 02:10:58.900]   that we do together.
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:00.300]   We take turns asking questions.
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:01.260]   We do a phone call.
[02:11:01.260 --> 02:11:02.380]   We do meetings.
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:03.900]   It's a wonderful experience.
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:07.180]   So can you just give the, people are tired
[02:11:07.180 --> 02:11:08.100]   of hearing me talk about it.
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:10.540]   Tell people a little bit about firepower, if you could.
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:11.380]   - You know what?
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:15.540]   Firepower is something that the left would hate to see
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:16.740]   when they see it.
[02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:19.100]   Because they can't stand the fact that you being
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:20.820]   a white male and I'm being a black male,
[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:22.900]   and we both support President Trump.
[02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:25.340]   For them, that is the number one no-no.
[02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:27.340]   I mean, you already got two strikes against you
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:29.100]   because you're a white male.
[02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:31.260]   And then, well, you're a male, you're white.
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:33.540]   And then I guess the other strike is you're straight.
[02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:34.620]   I'm assuming you're straight.
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:36.880]   And then you're a Trump supporter.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.260]   You know, I guess I shouldn't assume.
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:41.380]   But, you know.
[02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:42.780]   - You just assume my gender, Will.
[02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:45.100]   I assume my gender here.
[02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:46.340]   - You know, but you know what?
[02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:48.860]   Firepower is something that we have hundreds
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:52.140]   of thousands of people that love what we're doing, Tom.
[02:11:52.140 --> 02:11:57.140]   And I'm so thankful and it's a blessing to be here,
[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:59.020]   to have this platform with you,
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:00.900]   and to reach so many people and talk about
[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:03.740]   the different issues that actually matter.
[02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:06.820]   Not stuff that we feel that we should be pushing
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:07.660]   onto people.
[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:09.820]   Talking about what the left is doing.
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:10.980]   And you know, I have this whole thing,
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:12.700]   like I like to trigger liberals.
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:15.380]   And when I speak about the things that's going on
[02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:19.840]   in the world, the crazy stuff, nine times out of ten,
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:22.580]   you can guarantee that there's a progressive liberal
[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:25.380]   behind it that's actually pushing the agenda.
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:26.780]   The same thing which you just talked about
[02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:28.460]   with the university.
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:31.460]   With them, you know, want to exclude white people
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:35.420]   from teaching about racism and white supremacy.
[02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:37.300]   Instead of including the people that they say
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:39.780]   are the problem so we can have the open discussion.
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:42.860]   So you and I have open discussion every single night.
[02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:44.540]   And we want to get to the same goal,
[02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:47.740]   to wake up people to realize what has been happening
[02:12:47.740 --> 02:12:48.820]   in this country.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:51.500]   And we need more and more people to realize
[02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:54.820]   that we, you and I, we're not going to sit
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:56.900]   idly by and say nothing.
[02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:58.500]   You know, and you have more and more people
[02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:00.140]   waking up and saying more.
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:05.100]   So firepower is for us to get on fire for God
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:07.620]   and to get on fire for this country.
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:11.820]   And yes, because President Trump is our president.
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:13.460]   President Trump is our president.
[02:13:13.460 --> 02:13:16.820]   He is, we have to get on fire for our president
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:19.100]   because they are trying to impeach him.
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:20.220]   For what?
[02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:21.740]   Because he's done positive things.
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:24.420]   Look at the black unemployment.
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:27.340]   Lowest ever in the history of this country.
[02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:28.980]   Same thing with the Latino employment.
[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:30.020]   Lowest.
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:32.780]   More women are working now than the past 60 years.
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:35.260]   So that to them is a major problem.
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:36.900]   He's standing up for America.
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:39.940]   They can't stand the fact that we have a president
[02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:42.780]   that will do so much.
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:44.700]   So they have to go after him.
[02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:47.500]   So that's what firepower is about for us to show our support
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:48.740]   and our love for this country.
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:51.340]   And I don't care how many times I get the left
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:53.260]   send me these hateful messages.
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:54.900]   Actually, when I don't get the messages,
[02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:56.900]   I think, okay, I need to pick up my game
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:59.780]   because they're not getting ticked off by me doing my job.
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:02.220]   So that's what firepower is about,
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:06.980]   for us to be on fire for this country and on fire for God.
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:10.020]   - And you know, Will, it is truly, it's a fantastic show.
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:12.420]   And I'm so glad we have InfoWars store sponsoring us
[02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:14.300]   because it's really someplace you can go.
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:16.340]   We run lots of clips and then we have an hour,
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:18.220]   usually a fantastic interviews.
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:20.900]   And it's a good way to kind of recap your day.
[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:22.300]   We're extremely energetic,
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:23.140]   but at the same time,
[02:14:23.140 --> 02:14:24.900]   we know how to have some fun on that broadcast.
[02:14:24.900 --> 02:14:27.540]   On Friday, we typically take callers on the second hour.
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:30.100]   It's been a ton of fun doing that show with you.
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:31.860]   And I'm so glad you were able to come here today
[02:14:31.860 --> 02:14:32.780]   and talk about it.
[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:34.980]   So we're getting ready to go out to break here
[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:36.100]   in about a minute.
[02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:37.820]   But Will, when we come back,
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:40.460]   I want to get into the topic of impeachment
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:42.620]   because of course, last night we aired the clip on our show.
[02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:45.220]   We aired it again this morning of Joe Biden saying,
[02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:47.620]   "It is time to impeach President Trump."
[02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:50.580]   And that he is shooting holes in the constitution,
[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:54.260]   all of this absolute insanity when really,
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:56.020]   I mean, it's beyond projection.
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:57.300]   It's what they're doing, yes,
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:14:58.820]   but it's also what they want to do.
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:15:00.780]   They want to tear apart the constitution.
[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:02.820]   Every single Democrat wants to take away our guns.
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:04.780]   Every single Democrat wants to take away
[02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:06.320]   our first amendment rights.
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:07.620]   I also want to talk a little bit about
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:09.540]   what's happening on the China front,
[02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:12.700]   where we have virtually every American corporation
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:16.120]   walking in lockstep against the American people
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:17.820]   for the communist Chinese.
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:19.620]   So again, thank you, Will, for joining me.
[02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:21.260]   You'll be back for the next segment.
[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:23.420]   Everyone at home, you are watching and listening
[02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:25.380]   to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:28.620]   I am Tom Pampert filling in for Alex today.
[02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:32.020]   And another reminder, Alex will be in studio.
[02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:34.100]   So you will get to see Alex live
[02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:35.900]   and listen to him live today.
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:39.660]   He will be co-hosting with Will Johnson tonight
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:40.780]   on "Firepower."
[02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:44.580]   That's 7 p.m. for this absolutely fantastic
[02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:47.580]   and kind of insane rally that President Trump
[02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:49.940]   is having in Minneapolis, where they're trying to,
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:51.300]   what they're trying to do is they're trying to make it
[02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:52.220]   so he can't do it.
[02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:54.140]   They're ratcheting up the security costs
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:56.460]   to points that nobody has ever heard of before,
[02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:59.500]   and using that as a thinly veiled attempt
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:00.820]   to get him to cancel his rally.
[02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:01.980]   Well, he's not canceling it.
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:03.300]   You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:04.140]   We'll be back in a second.
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:06.580]   - Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain,
[02:16:06.580 --> 02:16:09.620]   the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:12.980]   No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month
[02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:14.700]   without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:17.260]   Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News,
[02:16:17.260 --> 02:16:20.100]   blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program
[02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:22.420]   in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:24.920]   Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:25.900]   during the gold rush,
[02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:27.580]   the money is in the mining equipment
[02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:30.540]   used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:32.380]   Not a security IPO or note,
[02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:34.060]   blockchain data centers have a proven
[02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:36.220]   turnkey equipment sale leaseback program
[02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:39.040]   with a 27% annualized lease payment
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.860]   deposited into your bank account each month.
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:42.700]   Don't miss this one.

[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:57.260]   800-600-3388.
[02:16:57.260 --> 02:16:58.620]   Equipment offer poses a financial risk.
[02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:00.020]   Owners consult with financial professionals
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:01.980]   before purchasing, not on offer to buy or sell a security
[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:03.940]   which requires an offering document.
[02:17:03.940 --> 02:17:06.420]   - Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage,

[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:11.840]   Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State

[02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:19.740]   where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children
[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:22.400]   without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:25.580]   to the freedom of Idaho or Montana,

[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:25.460]   Then you click the share button
[02:18:25.460 --> 02:18:27.140]   at the bottom of the screen.
[02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:28.200]   When the menu comes up,

[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:32.860]   It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:35.020]   I suggest Band.video.

[02:18:38.380 --> 02:18:40.460]   despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:41.980]   The globalists think you're lazy,
[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:43.340]   but by taking a little bit of action,
[02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:45.780]   you can override them, have the app,
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:48.860]   and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:51.300]   So it's up to you whether you wanna defy big tech

[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:09.020]   - There's a reason we were deplatformed 14 months ago.
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:11.980]   And it's because InfoWars has been over the target
[02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:14.820]   with something like a 98% accuracy rate.
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:17.540]   We have laid out everything that's going on
[02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:20.380]   and folks are really paying attention now.
[02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:22.100]   That means now is the time
[02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:24.300]   to support the InfoWars more than ever.
[02:19:24.300 --> 02:19:27.180]   And we're gonna take this thing over the top together.
[02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:31.460]   Everything must go super sale, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:34.020]   This sale on some items on the site
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:36.500]   is the biggest sale we've ever offered.

[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:35.260]   - America is coming back.
[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:37.820]   People in California have been suffering too long
[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:39.420]   from under the Democratic Party.
[02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:40.940]   People are still being censored.
[02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:43.180]   The shadow banning's taking place.
[02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:45.460]   Why is Google trying to change the outcome
[02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:46.820]   of the 2020 election?
[02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:47.780]   - Get your (beep) out of here.
[02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:48.740]   - You're approaching me?
[02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:49.700]   Trump supposed to be racist.
[02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:51.860]   Why he treating us all nice like that?
[02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:52.900]   - You know, I'm gonna give you a hug
[02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:54.500]   'cause I appreciate you.
[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:55.820]   (crowd cheering)
[02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:57.060]   - If she's not your president,
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:58.700]   then you're an illegal resident.
[02:20:58.700 --> 02:21:01.020]   If you're pro-American, if you're pro-Trump,
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:03.820]   then that goes against their community standards.
[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:04.780]   (crowd booing)
[02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:07.180]   I like triggering little
[02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:08.820]   and I like triggering them with facts.
[02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:09.860]   I mean, I'm serious.
[02:21:09.860 --> 02:21:11.780]   You know, it's becoming an issue.
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:12.940]   (man laughing)
[02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:16.220]   Why do you put illegals ahead of Americans?
[02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:17.060]   Time to go.
[02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:17.900]   Don't touch me.
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:18.740]   Don't touch me.
[02:21:18.740 --> 02:21:19.860]   Just because you have some idiot
[02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:22.980]   that went out there and did this horrific crime,
[02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:27.580]   doesn't mean law-abiding citizens should be penalized for it.
[02:21:27.580 --> 02:21:30.340]   - Firepower with Will Johnson.
[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:32.740]   Weeknight, seven till nine central,
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:35.820]   only at band.video.
[02:21:37.380 --> 02:21:39.980]   That was of course the promo for Firepower
[02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:42.060]   where you can find me and Will
[02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:44.660]   every single weekday night from seven until nine,
[02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:47.420]   except for tonight where you'll find Alex Jones there
[02:21:47.420 --> 02:21:52.100]   with Will and they'll be covering the insane Trump rally
[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:54.500]   that's going to be ongoing later tonight.
[02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:58.260]   So Will, we, last night, you unearthed a clip.
[02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.380]   One thing I love about Will Johnson, folks,
[02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:03.300]   is he watches CNN so you don't have to.
[02:22:03.300 --> 02:22:04.620]   And that, I don't,
[02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:06.700]   you must be getting some great supplements
[02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:09.180]   from InfoWars store not to have high blood pressure
[02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:10.580]   and heart problems from doing that
[02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:11.700]   because I can barely stand
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:13.260]   to watch the Communist News Network.
[02:22:13.260 --> 02:22:17.820]   But let's play clip seven about Simone Sanders
[02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:21.100]   openly lying on CNN and defending Schiff
[02:22:21.100 --> 02:22:23.020]   and trying to get President Trump impeached.
[02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:24.060]   Let's roll that clip.
[02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:28.260]   - Vice President Biden stood in Wilmington, Delaware,
[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:32.100]   and he said if Donald Trump refused to cooperate
[02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:34.820]   and obstructed the investigation
[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:37.500]   that Congress has as their constitutional duty,
[02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:40.180]   it would be a tragedy of his own making
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:43.020]   and those actions would very necessarily
[02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:44.900]   lead to impeachment proceedings.
[02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:46.300]   Well, the last 15 days, Brooke,
[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:48.220]   have been a remarkable time
[02:22:48.220 --> 02:22:49.980]   in our American political history.
[02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:53.220]   I mean, from the whistleblower complaint being made public
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:57.900]   to the revelations that Trump specifically reached out
[02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:02.900]   to Ukraine and on a call with a foreign government
[02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:06.580]   and asked him to investigate his political opponent
[02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:08.700]   for his own personal political gain
[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:11.500]   to in just the last 24 hours,
[02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:14.380]   Donald Trump asserting that he is not beholden
[02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:17.660]   to our constitution and obstructing the investigation
[02:23:17.660 --> 02:23:20.940]   of Congress by not allowing an ambassador to participate.
[02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:22.420]   As Vice President Biden noted today,
[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:24.940]   Donald Trump stood on the White House lawn
[02:23:24.940 --> 02:23:27.420]   and asked Ukraine as well as China
[02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:29.460]   to investigate his political opponent.
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:30.980]   It has been made very clear.
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:32.220]   Vice President Biden said today
[02:23:32.220 --> 02:23:34.500]   that Donald Trump has betrayed our country,
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:37.900]   his oath of office, and he has committed impeachable acts.
[02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:42.860]   - Wow, total and complete insanity.
[02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:46.220]   So Will, can you unpack what they just said
[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:49.980]   and the significance of Symone Sanders saying it?
[02:23:49.980 --> 02:23:53.260]   - You know what, with her saying it is kind of ironic
[02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:55.220]   because she was one of the main ones
[02:23:55.220 --> 02:23:57.780]   that was talking about how white people,
[02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:00.100]   specifically white males are the problem.
[02:24:00.100 --> 02:24:03.820]   And now she's working on Joe Biden's campaign.
[02:24:03.820 --> 02:24:07.820]   I mean, I don't know how anyone would take her serious
[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:10.540]   from anything that she has to say.
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:12.300]   One hand, she hates white people,
[02:24:12.300 --> 02:24:14.620]   then on the next hand, she's trying to get one elected.
[02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:17.860]   But you know what, the Democrats are done with Joe Biden.
[02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:20.220]   And for her to sit there on CNN,
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:24.380]   the criminal news network, and sit there and say that Trump,
[02:24:24.380 --> 02:24:29.220]   President Trump reached out to China and Ukraine
[02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:32.060]   for political help against Joe Biden
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:36.060]   when everyone knows that there's no way
[02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:40.500]   that Joe Biden can beat President Trump.
[02:24:40.500 --> 02:24:42.180]   It's just not possible.
[02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:45.460]   And they know this, they're using Joe Biden right now
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:46.660]   as a pawn.
[02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:50.260]   They're throwing Joe Biden under the bus
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:54.140]   just so they can bring up this whole scandal that happened,
[02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:56.820]   yes, under the Obama administration.
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:58.300]   You know how they always say that,
[02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:03.380]   the Obama administration is 100% scandal free?
[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:05.060]   Well, it's just a total lie.
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:09.500]   This took place under what Joe Biden did and his son,
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:13.020]   this took place under the Obama administration.
[02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:15.740]   But we don't have to get into that, what the IRS was doing.
[02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:21.420]   But anyways, on a side note, they are at President Trump,
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:25.940]   and now they're going after Rudy Giuliani.
[02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:29.460]   All because of impeachment, because Rudy Giuliani,
[02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:31.020]   he talked to some people in Ukraine.
[02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:33.820]   And now there's two people, to my understanding,
[02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:39.700]   that have been indicted for campaign fraudulent charges
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:41.900]   or something like that to the matter.
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:47.340]   My question, Tom, is how come we haven't seen anyone
[02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:50.380]   on the left indicted for the crimes
[02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:51.860]   that they have committed?
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:53.060]   This is just recent.
[02:25:53.060 --> 02:25:55.540]   They're talking about it all on the liberal media news
[02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:57.900]   because they're trying to figure out how to wait to knock
[02:25:57.900 --> 02:26:00.660]   Rudy Giuliani off the block.
[02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:03.820]   So he'll stop talking about Joe Biden and the corruption.
[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:06.700]   Because actually, there's an article up here
[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:12.060]   that talks about Joe Biden said that fireworks in October,
[02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:14.620]   Giuliani says Biden, Clinton, Obama
[02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:17.380]   will be exposed within weeks.
[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:20.300]   So you know, if he has the goods on him,
[02:26:20.300 --> 02:26:23.620]   they have to shut him down before he releases anything.
[02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:25.060]   So they're trying to shut him up.
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:26.260]   That's exactly what it is.
[02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:29.660]   How do we not recognize this as the American people?
[02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:31.300]   I don't get it.
[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:33.340]   Well, I think you're really onto something there.
[02:26:33.340 --> 02:26:35.020]   And I think that probably explains
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:38.260]   why the Biden campaign sent that letter out just a couple
[02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:40.980]   weeks ago instructing, I mean, ordering.
[02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:43.180]   Like, they are the dictator, the czar.
[02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:45.460]   The Biden campaign is already ruling the country.
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:47.620]   They ordered every single news outlet
[02:26:47.620 --> 02:26:50.820]   to stop having Rudy Giuliani, the lawyer for the president,
[02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:54.740]   the man who was mayor of New York during 9/11,
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:56.460]   the greatest terrorist attack that's
[02:26:56.460 --> 02:26:58.220]   ever struck on American soil.
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:02.300]   They ordered these networks to stop having him on television.
[02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:04.460]   And then, of course, we saw the viewers
[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:06.300]   who saw the first and second hour
[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:09.460]   saw Rudy Giuliani saying that, yes, there will be fireworks.
[02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:10.740]   There will be indictments.
[02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:15.300]   This is going to go to the top of the Obama administration.
[02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:16.780]   And I certainly hope so.
[02:27:16.780 --> 02:27:18.500]   Because, Will, I think you agree with me.
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:22.820]   Americans are getting sick and tired of the Democrats getting
[02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:24.780]   outweighed with anything they want.
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:27.140]   We now know-- we've known for years
[02:27:27.140 --> 02:27:31.780]   that Clinton had a pay-for-play situation happening
[02:27:31.780 --> 02:27:33.980]   with the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.
[02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:36.020]   People know because of Patrick Halley's reporting
[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:39.700]   on nationalfile.com that Nancy Pelosi's son was working
[02:27:39.700 --> 02:27:41.580]   at one of these energy companies that did
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:43.220]   massive business in Ukraine.
[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:46.060]   People now know because of President Trump and Ukraine
[02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:47.820]   and that wonderful release transcript
[02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:51.060]   that Joe Biden and his son likely had a pay-for-play
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:52.420]   situation happening there.
[02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:54.460]   So, Will, in our last minute, let's
[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:57.220]   talk about where can people find, of course, Firepower.
[02:27:57.220 --> 02:27:59.620]   Where can people follow you on social media?
[02:27:59.620 --> 02:28:00.980]   You know what?
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:04.380]   If you go to Twitter, it's @firepowernews,
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:07.740]   @firepowernews on Twitter.
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:09.940]   Check the messages there every single day.

[02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:20.820]   You know what, Tom?
[02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:24.980]   It's a real honor and a pleasure that you're on this Firepower
[02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:26.740]   travel train with me.
[02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:28.940]   So we've got to do everything we can.
[02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:30.140]   I love this country.
[02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:32.180]   I love being a free black man.
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:35.820]   I love being a free American, most of all.
[02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:38.140]   And of course, I love to say this,
[02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:41.660]   that we have to get on our knees on a day-to-day basis
[02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:44.820]   and say, in the name of Jesus, thank you, Lord,
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:47.540]   for bringing us President Trump.
[02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:49.900]   Thank you, Lord, for hearing our prayers.
[02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:52.260]   Thanks, Tom, for having me on with you.
[02:28:52.260 --> 02:28:53.100]   Absolutely, Will.
[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:54.180]   Thank you so much for coming on.
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:56.100]   And remember, folks, you can catch Will tonight,
[02:28:56.100 --> 02:28:57.980]   7 PM on Firepower.
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:28:59.700]   He'll be there with Alex Jones.

[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:06.860]   My fellow freedom lovers, I'm very excited to bring you

[02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:10.420]   I've been wanting a beat formula for years

[02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:12.420]   I could sit here and do a victory lap,
[02:30:12.420 --> 02:30:13.900]   but folks, we don't have time.
[02:30:13.900 --> 02:30:15.380]   I don't wanna do a victory lap.
[02:30:15.380 --> 02:30:17.620]   I'm not happy that I was right about all this.

[02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:08.500]   China was already running the United States.
[02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:10.340]   You're like, well, China could never take over the US.
[02:31:10.340 --> 02:31:11.340]   That's right.
[02:31:11.340 --> 02:31:15.500]   As the Roman historian and Senator Cicero warned,
[02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:18.300]   a powerful empire can't fall from without
[02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:21.340]   before it first falls from within.
[02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:25.140]   So yes, they're coming for your guns, all of them.
[02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:26.860]   Yes, they're coming for your children.
[02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:29.380]   They've already taken your speech almost everywhere,
[02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:31.180]   except pockets of resistance,
[02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:34.300]   like infowars.com and Band.video.
[02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:36.380]   So now you know why I'm so upset.
[02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:38.380]   Now you know why I'm so angry.
[02:31:38.380 --> 02:31:41.220]   I saw the producers of South Park on TV.
[02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:42.660]   They're totally pissing angry.
[02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:43.900]   People are like, why are they angry?
[02:31:43.900 --> 02:31:46.020]   Because they see all of their freedom,
[02:31:46.020 --> 02:31:49.340]   their American freedom, hard fought, taken away.
[02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.780]   Are you gonna get upset?
[02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:51.700]   Well, you're a listener.
[02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:53.140]   You obviously are upset.
[02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:55.180]   But you've gotta ring the alarm everywhere
[02:31:55.180 --> 02:31:57.100]   and tell others they've gotta get upset,
[02:31:57.100 --> 02:31:59.100]   and then take action and let Congress,
[02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:01.300]   everybody else know that we're not backing down
[02:32:01.300 --> 02:32:03.900]   and we're not gonna sell America out to the shy cops.
[02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:08.500]   Now is the critical time to keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:32:08.500 --> 02:32:11.540]   Everything we've warned of is now being exposed
[02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:12.780]   and is out in the open.
[02:32:12.780 --> 02:32:13.900]   I wanna be clear.
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:15.420]   It's not coming true.
[02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:17.180]   It was already true.
[02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:18.700]   I didn't predict all this.
[02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:20.300]   It was already going on.
[02:32:20.300 --> 02:32:23.020]   Now the globalists are making their move with the shy cops,
[02:32:23.020 --> 02:32:25.420]   so it's naked, it's brazen.
[02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:28.260]   This is the point when the enemy emerges.
[02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:29.740]   It's like before World War II,
[02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.660]   the Poles kept warning that Nazi Germany
[02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:32.660]   was gonna attack them.
[02:32:32.660 --> 02:32:35.540]   Nobody believed them as they saw the troops smashing
[02:32:35.540 --> 02:32:37.460]   until it finally happened.
[02:32:37.460 --> 02:32:38.980]   We're at that same point,
[02:32:38.980 --> 02:32:41.620]   and we're all Paul Revere's who need to be out there
[02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:43.820]   warning everyone about what's unfolding
[02:32:43.820 --> 02:32:45.780]   because this is the critical fight.
[02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:47.940]   And thank God, America and the world
[02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:51.460]   is waking up at the 11th hour, 58 minute.
[02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:53.660]   But will it be too little, too late?
[02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:54.620]   That's up to you.
[02:32:54.620 --> 02:32:56.420]   This battle's hot, it's real.
[02:32:56.420 --> 02:32:58.900]   So spread the word and support InfoWars today
[02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:00.380]   at infowarsstore.com.
[02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:01.580]   But whatever you do,
[02:33:01.580 --> 02:33:03.780]   spread the word about the live transmission.
[02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:06.020]   (clicking)
[02:33:06.020 --> 02:33:10.940]   - You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:18.540]   (upbeat music)
[02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:30.500]   Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic,
[02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:32.420]   it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.020 --> 02:33:36.460]   - Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:36.460 --> 02:33:39.700]   I am Tom Papert, your guest host today.
[02:33:39.700 --> 02:33:42.380]   Remember, you can catch Alex, you can still see him live.
[02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:43.900]   It's very rare when he takes a day
[02:33:43.900 --> 02:33:45.740]   when he's on an important mission out there,
[02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:47.740]   but he can still make it back to the studio.
[02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:51.060]   But he will be back tonight at 7 p.m.
[02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:53.580]   as a guest co-host with Will Johnson
[02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:55.740]   on firepower for the Trump rally.
[02:33:55.740 --> 02:33:57.420]   That's 7 p.m. tonight.
[02:33:57.420 --> 02:34:01.780]   Watch it at band.video, band.video.
[02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:04.380]   I wanna return to something that we talked about briefly
[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:07.660]   when Patrick Halley was on with us earlier in the show.
[02:34:07.660 --> 02:34:09.500]   That is Turkey.
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:12.060]   He's really the dictator.
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:15.620]   They had a faux military uprising a couple years ago.
[02:34:15.620 --> 02:34:17.220]   Many will remember this in Turkey,
[02:34:17.220 --> 02:34:21.460]   where it was allegedly a coup against Erdogan.
[02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:24.260]   And he was able to crush this coup.
[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:25.740]   There were videos in Turkey
[02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:27.780]   where it looked like there was absolutely no violence,
[02:34:27.780 --> 02:34:29.460]   no nothing, it was a lot of fireworks,
[02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:31.060]   a lot of pomp and circumstance.
[02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:33.540]   And afterwards, Erdogan took essentially
[02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:36.060]   complete control of the country,
[02:34:36.060 --> 02:34:38.940]   and it is now a Muslim theocracy.
[02:34:38.940 --> 02:34:41.940]   But it goes much deeper than that.
[02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:43.660]   I mean, longtime viewers of Alex Jones
[02:34:43.660 --> 02:34:45.380]   will remember a few years ago
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:48.380]   when Turkey started threatening the European Union
[02:34:48.380 --> 02:34:50.700]   and saying that Turkey had to do,
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:53.540]   or the European Union had to do the bidding of Turkey.
[02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:55.380]   Turkey wanted to be in the Union.
[02:34:55.380 --> 02:34:57.140]   Turkey wanted to be in the Eurozone.
[02:34:57.140 --> 02:34:58.900]   Turkey wants all the privileges
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:00.660]   that come with being part of the European Union.
[02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:03.060]   If the European Union would not do
[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:04.660]   exactly what Turkey wanted,
[02:35:04.660 --> 02:35:08.460]   well, the country, Erdogan, threatened to unleash
[02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:12.860]   millions and millions of so-called Syrian refugees
[02:35:12.860 --> 02:35:15.220]   onto the European people.
[02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:18.060]   This is after Europe has struggled
[02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:21.380]   with bringing in millions that came through the,
[02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:25.820]   as a result of the so-called Syrian Civil War,
[02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:28.100]   where they say that pro-democracy forces
[02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:29.900]   were trying to depose Assad.
[02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:31.660]   Of course, this all really goes back
[02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:34.900]   to the Hillary Clinton Department of State,
[02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:37.860]   where we had multiple Middle Eastern countries,
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:42.860]   Libya, Egypt, others, be destabilized and destroyed
[02:35:42.860 --> 02:35:45.820]   with the express purpose, I mean, likely purpose,
[02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:48.100]   of flooding Europe with immigrants.
[02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:52.300]   Everybody remembers Gaddafi, the former ruler of Libya,
[02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:54.660]   saying that Europe needs Gaddafi,
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:56.940]   and if Gaddafi were to go away,
[02:35:56.940 --> 02:36:00.020]   the floodgates from Africa would be opened
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:03.380]   and Europe would be overrun with migrants.
[02:36:03.380 --> 02:36:04.980]   Well, that's exactly what happened.
[02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:08.620]   Hillary Clinton sought to the death of Gaddafi,
[02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:11.140]   and now Europe has been flooded with immigrants,
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:13.260]   except for those who were commandeered
[02:36:13.260 --> 02:36:16.740]   and taken in, somewhat, by Turkey.
[02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:18.980]   Well, now Turkey is doing it again,
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:21.100]   because President Trump removed troops
[02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:23.900]   from a small section, it was about 50 troops.
[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:26.460]   Everybody is blowing this way out of proportion.
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:30.420]   President Trump removed 50 troops from Northern Syria.
[02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:34.340]   The Democrats and the Warhawks and the Republican Party,
[02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:37.860]   the Uniparty, is saying that Trump betrayed the Kurds
[02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:39.380]   and left them to die.
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:42.340]   I mean, despite the fact that we now have training video
[02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:45.180]   of what appear to be the Kurds training Antifa,
[02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:47.020]   despite the fact that the Kurds themselves
[02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:49.100]   are no wonderful, peachy people,
[02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:52.380]   as President Trump will often remind us,
[02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:54.060]   they're saying that he has abandoned the Kurds,
[02:36:54.060 --> 02:36:56.500]   and because he has left, he has withdrawn.
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:58.780]   Finally, some troops are coming home from the Middle East.
[02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:01.700]   Because of this, Turkey has taken it upon itself
[02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:03.700]   to invade with what they are calling
[02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:07.020]   a peacekeeping force and terrorist fighting force.
[02:37:07.020 --> 02:37:10.260]   They're invading Northern Syria.
[02:37:10.260 --> 02:37:13.740]   There have been reports of citizens, of bystanders,
[02:37:13.740 --> 02:37:15.820]   innocent people being killed by the Turks.
[02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:19.740]   There have been reports that the Kurdish forces
[02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:21.300]   are being totally overrun.
[02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:24.620]   And now, as world leaders are coming out
[02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:27.940]   to condemn Turkey for doing this,
[02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:32.300]   Turkey is once again threatening the European Union,
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:36.420]   threatening the West with another migrant crisis.
[02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:39.140]   It was reported first by Reuters early today,
[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:44.140]   Turkey's Eragon threatens to send Syrian refugees to Europe.
[02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:47.060]   And InfoWars as well has a phenomenal article about this
[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:49.580]   by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:52.340]   President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday,
[02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:57.340]   Ankara will send the 3.6 million Syrian refugees
[02:37:57.340 --> 02:38:00.980]   in Turkey to Europe if European countries label
[02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:05.980]   the country's military incursion in Syria as an occupation.
[02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:08.380]   Quote, "We will open the gates
[02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:12.740]   "and send 3.6 million refugees your way,"
[02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:16.940]   Erdogan said in a speech to lawmakers from his AK party.
[02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:22.620]   This, to me, this had to end sooner or later.
[02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:24.740]   I think that the world owes President Trump
[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:28.860]   a massive thank you because president or dictator,
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:30.820]   whatever this guy's title is now,
[02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:34.060]   Erdogan has been holding this over the heads of the West
[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:39.060]   for five years almost, 3.6 million Syrians.
[02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:41.060]   Of course, many of them are not even Syrian.
[02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:42.740]   Many of them are just coming from Africa,
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:43.980]   some sub-Saharan Africa.
[02:38:43.980 --> 02:38:45.420]   Everybody wants to get into Europe
[02:38:45.420 --> 02:38:48.540]   because it is the welfare capital of the world.
[02:38:48.540 --> 02:38:51.140]   I mean, the facts are simple behind this.
[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:53.300]   Somebody can work in a country like Syria
[02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:55.860]   their entire life, maybe they'll make $20,000
[02:38:55.860 --> 02:38:58.340]   over the course of a lifetime of working.
[02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:02.860]   Or they can move to Germany, they can move to Sweden,
[02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:05.940]   they can move to France, they can get on public benefits,
[02:39:05.940 --> 02:39:07.340]   some public benefits, by the way,
[02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:09.900]   that are not even available to the citizens
[02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:10.940]   of those respective countries,
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:13.860]   and they're exclusively meant for these so-called refugees.
[02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:15.220]   They can get on these public benefits,
[02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:17.180]   they can get on welfare, in other words,
[02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:20.180]   and they can make more money sitting on their hind end
[02:39:20.180 --> 02:39:23.220]   in one year than they can make working
[02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:26.100]   over the course of an entire lifetime
[02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:28.460]   in a country like Syria.
[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:31.180]   So Erdogan has been threatening the United,
[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:34.260]   the Western world with this for several years now,
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:35.980]   and President Trump is finally,
[02:39:35.980 --> 02:39:39.100]   essentially making them do it or shut up about it.
[02:39:39.100 --> 02:39:42.220]   I think that it's a move that's needed to be made
[02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:44.340]   for some time now, and I hope that President Trump
[02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:47.540]   will now continue to withdraw troops from the Middle East.
[02:39:47.540 --> 02:39:49.860]   There is no good reason for our men and women
[02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:50.780]   to be in Afghanistan.
[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:52.100]   There is no good reason for our men and women
[02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:55.500]   to be in Iraq or any of these sandbox countries
[02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:58.940]   where they're fighting for poppy fields and oil.
[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:00.660]   And as President Trump recently said,
[02:40:00.660 --> 02:40:03.020]   and Patrick Howley said earlier on this broadcast,
[02:40:03.020 --> 02:40:05.860]   nobody is happier about the situation
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:07.860]   in the Middle East than the Chinese.
[02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:10.780]   Afghanistan has been called for decades
[02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:13.540]   the graveyard of empires.
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:17.300]   It is largely how the Soviet Union fell.
[02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:19.620]   The Soviet Union spent years embroiled
[02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:21.820]   in a costly conflict in Afghanistan,
[02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:24.380]   and it bankrupted the Soviet Union.
[02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:27.980]   Now how many millions, billions, trillions of dollars
[02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:32.260]   has the United States spent in the same exact quagmire?
[02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:33.980]   So not only is President Trump starting
[02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:35.980]   to withdraw our troops from these pointless,
[02:40:35.980 --> 02:40:38.220]   ceaseless, endless wars,
[02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:40.100]   not only is President Trump doing that,
[02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:43.500]   he is forcing Turkey to finally play its card.
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:47.220]   I think that it's a phenomenal, phenomenal event.
[02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:49.460]   There's another article up on newswars.com.
[02:40:49.460 --> 02:40:53.180]   Rand Paul is of course supporting
[02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:54.820]   this move by President Trump.
[02:40:54.820 --> 02:40:58.340]   He says, "Neocons want to keep starting endless wars
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:02.380]   "in conflicts that go back hundreds of years."
[02:41:02.380 --> 02:41:04.500]   Rand Paul is of course responding to Lindsey Graham
[02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:06.580]   and the other neocons, the other war hawks
[02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:08.860]   who claim to be Republican.
[02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:10.780]   Paul tore apart Senator Lindsey Graham
[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:12.700]   and Representative Liz Cheney again,
[02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:16.060]   labeling them the Neocon War Caucus
[02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:17.940]   as they continue their attacks on Trump
[02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:21.220]   following Turkey's assault on Kurdish forces in Syria.
[02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:23.860]   Senator Rand Paul noted that, "Though they want a war,
[02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:26.860]   "the neocons are not sure who they want to side with."
[02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:28.820]   He added that the conflicts they want to continue
[02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:30.180]   date back centuries,
[02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:32.340]   and that their positions make zero sense.
[02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:35.420]   Paul also noted that Trump is the first president
[02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:36.820]   for many years to realize
[02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:40.820]   that endless military involvement weakens the country.
[02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:42.780]   Liz Cheney, who has previously accused Paul
[02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:43.940]   of putting terrorists first,
[02:41:43.940 --> 02:41:47.620]   has called Trump's Syria move a catastrophic mistake,
[02:41:47.620 --> 02:41:49.020]   while Graham has said Trump's decision
[02:41:49.020 --> 02:41:50.260]   could put the nation at risk
[02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:53.700]   and is the biggest mistake of his presidency.
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:58.980]   And again, we're talking about 50 soldiers here.
[02:41:58.980 --> 02:42:01.580]   We're talking about 50 men and women.
[02:42:01.580 --> 02:42:05.140]   We have troops all over Afghanistan, all over Iraq,
[02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:08.140]   all over the Middle East, and what do we get from it?
[02:42:08.140 --> 02:42:10.700]   We get dead soldiers.
[02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:12.180]   That's what it comes down to.
[02:42:12.180 --> 02:42:14.700]   So I am proud that Rand Paul is doing this.
[02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:16.020]   I'm impressed Rand Paul is doing this.
[02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:17.820]   Rand Paul, by the way, many will remember
[02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:19.620]   that before John McCain's death,
[02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:23.260]   Senator One Vote, as President Trump routinely calls him,
[02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:28.020]   he accused Rand Paul of doing the bidding of the Russians.
[02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:31.420]   So when it comes to war, if Rand Paul is on your side,
[02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:33.700]   I think it's generally a good sign.
[02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:35.220]   So bravo, President Trump.
[02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:37.340]   Thank you so much for doing this.
[02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:38.820]   In the next segment, we're gonna talk a little bit
[02:42:38.820 --> 02:42:42.220]   about Kamala Harris and her faltering campaign.
[02:42:42.220 --> 02:42:44.060]   It's getting rather pathetic these days.
[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:46.380]   We're gonna read from an email that was sent out
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:49.380]   that has been obtained by conservative platforms,
[02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:51.620]   including nationalfile.com.
[02:42:51.620 --> 02:42:53.580]   You're watching The Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:55.340]   I'm Tom Paffert, filling in for Alex.
[02:42:55.340 --> 02:42:58.540]   We'll be right back after this very short break
[02:42:58.540 --> 02:43:00.460]   with more coverage, and then later,
[02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:03.460]   we'll tell you who's gonna be hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:06.780]   - The globalists have been planning to make their move
[02:43:06.780 --> 02:43:09.100]   on America for decades and decades.
[02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:11.940]   Hillary was supposed to get in and complete the takeover,
[02:43:11.940 --> 02:43:13.460]   the censorship, all of it.
[02:43:13.460 --> 02:43:15.780]   That's why they took me off the air first
[02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:17.700]   and banned me across the internet,
[02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:20.460]   because they knew that what we were saying was dead on,
[02:43:20.460 --> 02:43:22.860]   and they didn't want us raising the alarm.
[02:43:22.860 --> 02:43:23.700]   Well, guess what?
[02:43:23.700 --> 02:43:24.980]   Thanks to you spreading the word
[02:43:24.980 --> 02:43:26.740]   instead of fastly supporting Infowars,
[02:43:26.740 --> 02:43:29.260]   we're still on the air, and we're still fighting.
[02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:31.380]   So please keep spreading the word

[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:49.220]   Who knows, the country will be here in six months.

[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:05.900]   >> Communist China quietly bought up
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:07.940]   Hollywood more than a decade ago,
[02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:09.980]   and they've been approving almost
[02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:11.740]   all the scripts that you see on
[02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:13.660]   television or in the movies for
[02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:14.460]   many years.
[02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:15.660]   And now they own our debt.
[02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:17.820]   Now they own the Democratic Party.
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:19.740]   Now they've merged with Silicon Valley
[02:44:19.740 --> 02:44:21.380]   to censor patriots off the air.
[02:44:21.380 --> 02:44:23.900]   Washington Post comes out and
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:25.420]   says they hope that Xi Jinping,
[02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:27.220]   the dictator of China, will, quote,
[02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:28.020]   destroy Trump.
[02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:29.220]   That's a headline.
[02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:31.780]   So Infowars has been the Paul Revere
[02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:32.980]   of this operation.
[02:44:32.980 --> 02:44:34.540]   We have blown the whistle
[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:35.660]   continuously and
[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:37.020]   have been proven right.
[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:38.540]   And that's why it's more important
[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:39.740]   than ever that we override
[02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:41.220]   Silicon Valley and their Chai Com
[02:44:41.220 --> 02:44:42.700]   masters by word of mouth and
[02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:44.860]   spread the word about Infowars.
[02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:46.860]   And check out InfowarsStore.com.
[02:44:46.860 --> 02:44:48.580]   That's where the arsenal of our
[02:44:48.580 --> 02:44:50.420]   republic is being funded.
[02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:52.180]   That's where the tip of the spear is
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:53.620]   continually being forged,
[02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:54.980]   is InfowarsStore.com.
[02:44:54.980 --> 02:45:04.980]   [MUSIC]
[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.180]   My phone has been ringing off
[02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:07.940]   the hook.
[02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:09.620]   Constitutional lawyers,
[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:11.380]   national talk show host,
[02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:12.780]   prominent guest I've had on over
[02:45:12.780 --> 02:45:13.340]   the years.
[02:45:13.340 --> 02:45:14.580]   And they're all saying, Alex,
[02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:15.780]   it's incredible.
[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:17.060]   You've been obsessing on China
[02:45:17.060 --> 02:45:18.500]   since you got on air
[02:45:18.500 --> 02:45:19.820]   20-something years ago.
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:21.260]   And now it's all coming true.
[02:45:21.260 --> 02:45:22.580]   How did you know it?
[02:45:22.580 --> 02:45:23.700]   Because the Council on Foreign
[02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:25.260]   Relations is the shadow government
[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:26.660]   and they admitted the plan to
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:28.620]   transfer all power to Communist
[02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:29.820]   China.
[02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:32.460]   And almost everyone calling me says,
[02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:34.620]   yeah, and they banned you because
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:35.780]   you were saying all that and
[02:45:35.780 --> 02:45:37.300]   how Silicon Valley, Google and
[02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:38.340]   Apple moved over there.
[02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:40.340]   And it's incredible and, wow,
[02:45:40.340 --> 02:45:41.060]   you're vindicated.
[02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:42.020]   You're gonna get back on the air
[02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:43.300]   now, aren't you?
[02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:45.700]   And no, if we don't defeat this
[02:45:45.700 --> 02:45:47.020]   takeover, you're all gonna be
[02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:47.860]   taken off.
[02:45:47.860 --> 02:45:48.620]   In fact, you're all gonna end up
[02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:50.100]   getting put in prison camps.
[02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:51.380]   They're making their move.
[02:45:51.380 --> 02:45:52.860]   They're coming for your guns.
[02:45:52.860 --> 02:45:54.260]   They're coming for your kids.
[02:45:54.260 --> 02:45:55.020]   They're coming for
[02:45:55.020 --> 02:45:56.260]   your right to religion.
[02:45:56.260 --> 02:45:58.580]   They are coming for your soul.
[02:45:58.580 --> 02:45:59.940]   >> Well, you know what they say,
[02:45:59.940 --> 02:46:01.540]   you gotta lower your ideals of
[02:46:01.540 --> 02:46:03.260]   freedom if you wanna suck on
[02:46:03.260 --> 02:46:05.100]   the warm teat of China.
[02:46:05.100 --> 02:46:07.020]   >> My friends, I've seen a lot of
[02:46:07.020 --> 02:46:09.380]   Donald Trump just like you have.
[02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:11.580]   And my goodness, yesterday's press
[02:46:11.580 --> 02:46:13.460]   conference when they came in on
[02:46:13.460 --> 02:46:15.140]   him with all their garbage,
[02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:16.620]   the foreign reporters,
[02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:17.740]   the US reporters,
[02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:19.940]   these little political sellouts,
[02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:22.060]   these whores, he just tore them to
[02:46:22.060 --> 02:46:22.620]   bits.
[02:46:22.620 --> 02:46:23.780]   And it's one thing to hear it if
[02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:24.780]   you're a radio listener,
[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:25.420]   it's powerful.
[02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:26.460]   But if you see it,
[02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:28.820]   it's all at band.video.
[02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:29.860]   You've got the full press
[02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:30.460]   conference.
[02:46:30.460 --> 02:46:32.060]   We've got my boil down of how
[02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:33.140]   epic it is.
[02:46:33.140 --> 02:46:34.260]   It's all at band.video.
[02:46:34.260 --> 02:46:35.980]   And you've gotta share this with
[02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:37.740]   people because Trump was hitting
[02:46:37.740 --> 02:46:39.340]   on all 45 cylinders.
[02:46:39.340 --> 02:46:40.380]   This was amazing.
[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:42.220]   And he turned the nitrous oxide on
[02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:42.860]   top of it.
[02:46:42.860 --> 02:46:44.620]   So InfoWars, America, Trump,
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:45.220]   all of us,
[02:46:45.220 --> 02:46:46.940]   incredible things are happening.
[02:46:46.940 --> 02:46:49.060]   And we're sharing the ideas that
[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:51.020]   are gonna defeat the tyrants at

[02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:53.140]   And I gotta tell you,
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:54.940]   we've done great video work.
[02:46:54.940 --> 02:46:56.100]   We've done great films.
[02:46:56.100 --> 02:46:57.060]   We've done so much, but
[02:46:57.060 --> 02:46:58.740]   websites are not our thing.
[02:46:58.740 --> 02:46:59.700]   Well, now they are.
[02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:01.500]   I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:02.020]   Check it out.
[02:47:02.020 --> 02:47:02.980]   There's a lot of new features
[02:47:02.980 --> 02:47:03.500]   at band.video.
[02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:09.020]   >> You're listening to
[02:47:09.020 --> 02:47:10.740]   The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:10.740 --> 02:47:17.940]   >> Wow, I feel good.
[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:24.940]   [MUSIC]
[02:47:24.940 --> 02:47:25.980]   >> Welcome back to
[02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:27.660]   The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:27.660 --> 02:47:29.220]   I'm Tom Paffer filling in for
[02:47:29.220 --> 02:47:29.940]   Alex today.
[02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:31.460]   He will be back in studio though
[02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:32.780]   tonight at 7 PM.
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:35.980]   I have in front of me a bombshell
[02:47:35.980 --> 02:47:38.060]   from InfoWars.com.
[02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:39.900]   As many have suspected,
[02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:43.260]   there is more to this story with
[02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:45.700]   Hunter Biden and Joe Biden than
[02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:48.020]   first appearance would indicate.
[02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:49.620]   The title, the headline,
[02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:50.780]   Bombshell.
[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:54.020]   Ukrainian MP says Joe Biden paid
[02:47:54.020 --> 02:47:58.180]   $900,000 by firm Hunter Biden
[02:47:58.180 --> 02:47:58.940]   works for.
[02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:03.180]   That is absolutely unprecedented.
[02:48:03.180 --> 02:48:04.380]   Let's just read a little bit from
[02:48:04.380 --> 02:48:04.940]   this article.
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:06.700]   You can read the full thing at
[02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:08.620]   InfoWars and NewsWars.com.
[02:48:08.620 --> 02:48:10.900]   Ukraine's parliamentarian
[02:48:10.900 --> 02:48:12.940]   Andrei Derkich, who was heading
[02:48:12.940 --> 02:48:15.060]   a criminal case on interference in
[02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:16.580]   the 2016 US elections,
[02:48:16.580 --> 02:48:18.740]   revealed on Wednesday that former
[02:48:18.740 --> 02:48:20.580]   Vice President Joe Biden was
[02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:22.340]   funneled $900,000 for
[02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:24.460]   lobbying activities by Burisma
[02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:26.740]   Group, where his son Hunter Biden
[02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:28.940]   has sat on the board of directors
[02:48:28.940 --> 02:48:29.940]   since 2014.
[02:48:29.940 --> 02:48:31.860]   Derkich provided charts and
[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:33.940]   images showing the connection
[02:48:33.940 --> 02:48:35.900]   between Burisma and US-based
[02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:38.260]   company Rosemont Seneca Partners,
[02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:40.500]   which of course was co-founded by
[02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:41.580]   Hunter Biden.
[02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:43.260]   Quote, this was the transfer of
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:44.700]   Burisma Group's funds for
[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:45.980]   lobbying activities,
[02:48:45.980 --> 02:48:47.460]   as investigators believe,
[02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:49.260]   personally to Joe Biden through
[02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:50.460]   a lobbying company.
[02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:52.420]   Funds in the amount of $900,000
[02:48:52.420 --> 02:48:54.260]   were transferred to the US-based
[02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:56.300]   company Rosemont Seneca Partners,
[02:48:56.300 --> 02:48:58.220]   which according to open sources,
[02:48:58.220 --> 02:49:00.140]   in particular the New York Times,
[02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:01.700]   is affiliated with Byman.
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:04.340]   Biden, the payment reference was
[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:07.260]   payment for consultative services.
[02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:08.300]   Hunter Biden and
[02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:10.060]   Rosemont Seneca co-founder
[02:49:10.060 --> 02:49:12.020]   Devin Archer, who is Burisma's
[02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:13.980]   independent director, were also
[02:49:13.980 --> 02:49:15.820]   paid big bucks by the Ukrainian
[02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:18.020]   gas company, according to Derkich.
[02:49:18.020 --> 02:49:19.580]   According to documents,
[02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:21.580]   Burisma paid no less than $16.5
[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:23.740]   million to former Polish president
[02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:25.980]   who became an independent director
[02:49:25.980 --> 02:49:27.820]   of Burisma Holdings in 2014,
[02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:28.740]   Joe Siencki.
[02:49:28.740 --> 02:49:30.860]   Now this is an actual quote from
[02:49:30.860 --> 02:49:32.900]   this investigator going on.
[02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:34.980]   Alan Apter, Burisma independent
[02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:36.780]   director, Devin Archer and
[02:49:36.780 --> 02:49:38.940]   Hunter Biden, who joined Burisma
[02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:40.860]   board of directors in 2014.
[02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:42.940]   Continuing, Derkich added, using
[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:45.020]   political and economic levelers of
[02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:47.100]   influencing Ukrainian authorities
[02:49:47.100 --> 02:49:48.820]   and manipulating the issue of
[02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:51.020]   providing financial aid to Ukraine,
[02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:52.860]   Joe Biden actively assisted in
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:54.620]   closing criminal cases into
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:49:56.660]   the activity of former Ukrainian
[02:49:56.660 --> 02:49:59.380]   ecology minister, Mikola Sochewski,
[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:00.940]   who is the founder and
[02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:02.700]   owner of Burisma Group.
[02:50:02.700 --> 02:50:04.620]   We all knew there was more to
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:05.540]   this story.
[02:50:05.540 --> 02:50:07.740]   I thought perhaps national file got
[02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:09.860]   to the bottom of it when we learned
[02:50:09.860 --> 02:50:11.540]   that Nancy Pelosi's son,
[02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:13.700]   Paul Pelosi Jr., was also perhaps
[02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:15.860]   involved in a Ukrainian scandal,
[02:50:15.860 --> 02:50:17.740]   having been the executive of
[02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:19.500]   an energy company that did
[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:21.620]   extensive business in Ukraine.
[02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:24.420]   Now we know it goes even deeper.
[02:50:24.420 --> 02:50:26.060]   I think Rudy Giuliani,
[02:50:26.060 --> 02:50:28.140]   may have been dead on the money
[02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:30.460]   when he said that this is going to
[02:50:30.460 --> 02:50:32.300]   end with the top levels of
[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:34.340]   the Obama administration.
[02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:36.340]   We all have seen the video where
[02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:38.420]   Joe Biden says, and I told them,
[02:50:38.420 --> 02:50:40.060]   if they don't believe me,
[02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:41.740]   call my boss, call Obama,
[02:50:41.740 --> 02:50:42.820]   see what he says.
[02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:46.820]   It's all coming out, folks.
[02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:48.340]   This explains why the Democrats
[02:50:48.340 --> 02:50:49.180]   are so worried.
[02:50:49.180 --> 02:50:50.860]   This explains why yesterday,
[02:50:50.860 --> 02:50:51.980]   Joe Biden called for
[02:50:51.980 --> 02:50:53.820]   President Trump to be impeached.
[02:50:53.820 --> 02:50:54.700]   And of course,
[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:56.860]   the Democrat play here is they're
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:50:58.740]   going to say that all of this is
[02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:01.020]   meaningless, because it came from
[02:51:01.020 --> 02:51:03.220]   President Donald Trump asking,
[02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:05.660]   in the words of Adam Shifty Schiff,
[02:51:05.660 --> 02:51:07.940]   asking for Ukraine to dig up dirt
[02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:09.940]   on his political opponents.
[02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:13.020]   And it is the job of Infowarriors
[02:51:13.020 --> 02:51:16.340]   to get out the real side of what's
[02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:18.140]   happened here.
[02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:20.580]   It's the job of the viewers of this
[02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:22.900]   broadcast to share the links,
[02:51:22.900 --> 02:51:24.660]   to share the articles,
[02:51:24.660 --> 02:51:26.320]   to get on the street and
[02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:28.660]   holler at the top of your lungs.
[02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:30.660]   And tell the truth about what's
[02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:31.460]   really happening.
[02:51:31.460 --> 02:51:33.220]   Because we've seen virtually every
[02:51:33.220 --> 02:51:34.660]   single Democrat candidate.
[02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:36.220]   I mean, this gives you an idea.
[02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:37.580]   This isn't evidence, but
[02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:39.060]   this gives you an idea to how
[02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:40.980]   complicit the Democrat Party really
[02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:41.480]   is.
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:43.140]   We saw Cory Booker say,
[02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:44.980]   if you want to get to Biden,
[02:51:44.980 --> 02:51:46.680]   you got to go through me,
[02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:47.540]   Spartacus.
[02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:48.980]   I guess he's going to fight,
[02:51:48.980 --> 02:51:50.420]   going to get in the arena for
[02:51:50.420 --> 02:51:52.100]   Joe Biden, going to defend him by
[02:51:52.100 --> 02:51:53.140]   any means necessary.
[02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:55.900]   We saw Kamala Harris refuse to
[02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:57.500]   even answer a question.
[02:51:57.500 --> 02:51:59.180]   And now Kamala Harris, I mean,
[02:51:59.180 --> 02:52:00.820]   the woman, I don't know what's
[02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:01.780]   going on with her.
[02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:03.060]   I don't know if Tulsi Gabbard
[02:52:03.060 --> 02:52:04.220]   threw her off her game and
[02:52:04.220 --> 02:52:05.680]   now the campaign's just going to
[02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:06.660]   go away into nowhere.
[02:52:06.660 --> 02:52:08.260]   Still, I don't know what the deal
[02:52:08.260 --> 02:52:10.140]   is, but just yesterday, she sent
[02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:11.860]   out an embarrassingly cringy
[02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:13.900]   political email asking for money.
[02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:15.660]   And folks, I just want to read
[02:52:15.660 --> 02:52:17.460]   a little bit from this because
[02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:19.300]   this is reminiscent, a lot of
[02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:21.220]   folks remember Hillary Clinton
[02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:23.020]   getting out there and saying,
[02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:25.020]   I don't know who made Pokemon Go,
[02:52:25.020 --> 02:52:26.580]   but we need Pokemon Go to
[02:52:26.580 --> 02:52:27.380]   the polls.
[02:52:27.380 --> 02:52:29.820]   It just still makes me cringe just
[02:52:29.820 --> 02:52:31.300]   thinking about it.
[02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:34.780]   So this is Kamala Harris's email.
[02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:36.980]   It was titled, y'all heard of
[02:52:36.980 --> 02:52:37.660]   TikTok?
[02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:39.420]   The story's available at
[02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:40.940]   nationalfile.com.
[02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:42.740]   Here's how the email starts.
[02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:44.340]   Hi y'all, Shelby here,
[02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:46.620]   Kamala's digital director.
[02:52:46.620 --> 02:52:48.820]   I am a human of the Internet.
[02:52:48.820 --> 02:52:50.380]   I spend a lot of time on Twitter
[02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:52.100]   reading the president's chaotic
[02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:52.580]   tweets.
[02:52:52.580 --> 02:52:53.820]   And when I need a break,
[02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:55.620]   there's this Instagram account of
[02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:57.380]   Scandinavian furniture that I go
[02:52:57.380 --> 02:52:58.620]   to look at to calm down.
[02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:01.620]   All right, what a thinly veiled
[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:04.740]   and pathetic attempt at courting
[02:53:04.740 --> 02:53:07.180]   the younger generations.
[02:53:07.180 --> 02:53:09.140]   This is stunningly pathetic,
[02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:10.700]   stunningly just sad and
[02:53:10.700 --> 02:53:12.380]   pathetic the way that they
[02:53:12.380 --> 02:53:14.500]   desperately tried to reach out to
[02:53:14.500 --> 02:53:16.780]   people, but it gets so much better.
[02:53:16.780 --> 02:53:17.980]   I mean, first of all,
[02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:19.740]   I would be shocked if this Shelby
[02:53:19.740 --> 02:53:21.260]   tweet was supposed to actually
[02:53:21.260 --> 02:53:21.740]   exist.
[02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:23.260]   It's probably a fictitious person
[02:53:23.260 --> 02:53:24.660]   they created for the purpose of
[02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:25.860]   their fundraising email.
[02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:27.460]   Second of all, I guess this is how
[02:53:27.460 --> 02:53:28.460]   young people talk.
[02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:30.020]   Alex Jones is one of the most
[02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:31.420]   popular Internet memes in
[02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:33.100]   the existence of the Internet.
[02:53:33.100 --> 02:53:34.860]   And it's not because he says,
[02:53:34.860 --> 02:53:36.100]   hi y'all, Alex here.
[02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:37.820]   There's no fundraising email
[02:53:37.820 --> 02:53:39.620]   coming from InfoWars saying,
[02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:41.140]   hi y'all, Michael here,
[02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:42.820]   Alex's digital director.
[02:53:42.820 --> 02:53:45.060]   This is the politics of the early
[02:53:45.060 --> 02:53:47.260]   2000s and the 1990s and 1980s
[02:53:47.260 --> 02:53:49.020]   where you, I don't know,
[02:53:49.020 --> 02:53:51.380]   1980s where you could assume that
[02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:53.220]   your audience is stupid.
[02:53:53.220 --> 02:53:55.260]   And any little attempt at an olive
[02:53:55.260 --> 02:53:56.780]   branch of reaching out to
[02:53:56.780 --> 02:53:58.820]   the younger generation will be met
[02:53:58.820 --> 02:54:00.500]   with thunderous applause.
[02:54:00.500 --> 02:54:02.140]   That's just not how it works
[02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:04.100]   anymore in the age of Alex Jones,
[02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:05.900]   in the age of President Trump.
[02:54:05.900 --> 02:54:07.620]   It just doesn't work that way
[02:54:07.620 --> 02:54:08.220]   anymore.
[02:54:08.220 --> 02:54:09.740]   So she goes on, finally,
[02:54:09.740 --> 02:54:11.220]   Shelby refers to TikTok,
[02:54:11.220 --> 02:54:13.020]   the new social network built on
[02:54:13.020 --> 02:54:14.820]   short viral videos that, yes,
[02:54:14.820 --> 02:54:16.940]   is extremely popular with teenagers
[02:54:16.940 --> 02:54:18.860]   and Generation Z, the Zoomers.
[02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:19.900]   Shelby goes on,
[02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:21.740]   my new favorite app is this app
[02:54:21.740 --> 02:54:22.780]   called TikTok.
[02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:25.220]   I literally watch it every night.
[02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:26.420]   Now I'm guessing the viewers of
[02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:27.020]   this broadcast,
[02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:28.140]   you probably have children out
[02:54:28.140 --> 02:54:29.500]   there. How many of your children
[02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:31.180]   say, yeah, I'm watching TikTok,
[02:54:31.180 --> 02:54:32.060]   dad?
[02:54:32.060 --> 02:54:34.220]   Just it's not the way any of this
[02:54:34.220 --> 02:54:34.780]   works.
[02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:35.740]   So she goes on,
[02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:37.820]   there's an account on there run by
[02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:39.900]   an English farmer who records his
[02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:41.980]   chickens and ducks running out of
[02:54:41.980 --> 02:54:43.500]   the barn each morning.
[02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:45.180]   He calls it early morning rush
[02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:46.540]   hour, it's the best.
[02:54:46.540 --> 02:54:47.980]   Now, so we did some research
[02:54:47.980 --> 02:54:49.180]   and found out that there is
[02:54:49.180 --> 02:54:50.540]   an actual account like that.
[02:54:50.540 --> 02:54:52.460]   But it's been extensively profiled
[02:54:52.460 --> 02:54:53.900]   by the likes of BuzzFeed,
[02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:55.740]   which calls into question whether
[02:54:55.740 --> 02:54:57.260]   or not again the Shelby person
[02:54:57.260 --> 02:54:59.020]   exists and whether or not again,
[02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:00.980]   she actually uses TikTok.
[02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:02.940]   I seriously doubt either.
[02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:05.340]   Then this Shelby person drops all
[02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:07.660]   pretense of being a totally woke
[02:55:07.660 --> 02:55:08.860]   17 year old and
[02:55:08.860 --> 02:55:11.620]   begs the recipient for money.
[02:55:11.620 --> 02:55:13.660]   Because you see, while Kamala
[02:55:13.660 --> 02:55:16.060]   Harris refuses to defend Joe Biden
[02:55:16.060 --> 02:55:17.980]   on television, in email,
[02:55:17.980 --> 02:55:19.980]   she's desperately afraid of
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:21.580]   the threat posed by Joe Biden's
[02:55:21.580 --> 02:55:22.300]   campaign.
[02:55:22.300 --> 02:55:23.100]   Let me tell you Kamala,
[02:55:23.100 --> 02:55:24.060]   I don't think she's your biggest
[02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:25.500]   threat. I don't think your campaign
[02:55:25.500 --> 02:55:27.180]   has a snowball's chance in hell.
[02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:28.700]   I think that locking up black men
[02:55:28.700 --> 02:55:30.220]   for small amounts of marijuana,
[02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:31.740]   I think they're refusing to let
[02:55:31.740 --> 02:55:33.340]   people go when you were basically
[02:55:33.340 --> 02:55:34.780]   required to because they were
[02:55:34.780 --> 02:55:36.140]   serving a life or even a death
[02:55:36.140 --> 02:55:37.580]   sentence and other evidence.
[02:55:37.580 --> 02:55:39.260]   I don't think you're going to have
[02:55:39.260 --> 02:55:40.700]   a very good time, especially
[02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:42.380]   considering Tulsi Gabbard will be
[02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:43.980]   in the next Democratic debate.
[02:55:43.980 --> 02:55:45.620]   So it immediately changes the
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:46.340]   tone though.
[02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:48.340]   Tick tock aside, I wanted to read
[02:55:48.340 --> 02:55:50.340]   you in on some big digital news in
[02:55:50.340 --> 02:55:51.780]   the fight for 2020.
[02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:53.700]   Joe Biden's Iowa campaign is
[02:55:53.700 --> 02:55:55.860]   dropping a whopping 6 million ad
[02:55:55.860 --> 02:55:57.940]   spend in Iowa, New Hampshire,
[02:55:57.940 --> 02:56:00.020]   South Carolina, and Nevada.
[02:56:00.020 --> 02:56:02.500]   Email goes on to beg for money and
[02:56:02.500 --> 02:56:05.140]   say that the Kamala's campaign is
[02:56:05.140 --> 02:56:07.780]   in dire trouble if they cannot get
[02:56:07.780 --> 02:56:08.340]   help.
[02:56:08.340 --> 02:56:10.580]   So this is just an insight into
[02:56:10.580 --> 02:56:12.420]   the Democrat campaign.
[02:56:12.420 --> 02:56:14.180]   I love obtaining these fundraising
[02:56:14.180 --> 02:56:14.660]   emails.
[02:56:14.660 --> 02:56:16.260]   In fact, I subscribed to several
[02:56:16.260 --> 02:56:17.620]   of them and they think I'm a
[02:56:17.620 --> 02:56:19.220]   wonderful newsletter recipient
[02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:20.980]   because I click every single time.
[02:56:20.980 --> 02:56:22.580]   But it's just to see what type of
[02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:24.180]   pathetic verbiage they might put
[02:56:24.180 --> 02:56:24.740]   in there.
[02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:27.220]   So just a quick reminder as we wrap
[02:56:27.220 --> 02:56:29.460]   up this hour of the broadcast,
[02:56:29.460 --> 02:56:32.020]   you can catch Alex Jones tonight at
[02:56:32.020 --> 02:56:35.140]   7PM Central Standard Time on Firepower.
[02:56:35.140 --> 02:56:37.380]   He'll be guest co-hosting with
[02:56:37.380 --> 02:56:40.020]   Will Johnson and they'll be covering
[02:56:40.020 --> 02:56:42.420]   the Trump rally that's going to be
[02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:43.940]   happening tonight.
[02:56:43.940 --> 02:56:45.140]   All sorts of fireworks are to be
[02:56:45.140 --> 02:56:45.860]   expected.
[02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:48.420]   Coming up in the next hour is Larry
[02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:49.940]   A. Johnson.
[02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:51.540]   He's a Penn State standout,
[02:56:51.540 --> 02:56:53.380]   former two-times pro bowler for
[02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:55.380]   all team for the Kansas City Chiefs.
[02:56:55.380 --> 02:56:56.820]   He now spends retirement raising
[02:56:56.820 --> 02:56:58.980]   his daughter and sits on the board
[02:56:58.980 --> 02:57:01.140]   of Motivational Edge, a non-profit
[02:57:01.140 --> 02:57:03.060]   that uses creative arts and music
[02:57:03.060 --> 02:57:04.340]   as therapy for young people.
[02:57:04.340 --> 02:57:04.980]   You can find him at
[02:57:04.980 --> 02:57:07.860]   themotivationaledge.com.
[02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:09.460]   And he'll be coming up in the next
[02:57:09.460 --> 02:57:12.500]   segment guest hosting the fourth hour.
[02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:13.940]   I want to remind everybody it's
[02:57:13.940 --> 02:57:15.940]   the Everything Must Go sale on
[02:57:15.940 --> 02:57:17.300]   Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:17.300 --> 02:57:19.700]   It is so vital that you help fund
[02:57:19.700 --> 02:57:22.980]   the Info War going into next year.
[02:57:22.980 --> 02:57:24.420]   These products will not last.
[02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:26.180]   These sales cannot last.
[02:57:26.180 --> 02:57:27.940]   This may be the biggest sale Alex
[02:57:27.940 --> 02:57:29.300]   has ever done and it is going to
[02:57:29.300 --> 02:57:31.540]   go away as soon as products sell out.
[02:57:31.540 --> 02:57:33.060]   There's no guarantee these products
[02:57:33.060 --> 02:57:34.820]   will be back before the end of the year.
[02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:36.180]   So I've been Tom Papert,
[02:57:36.180 --> 02:57:38.820]   guest hosting for Alex Jones.
[02:57:38.820 --> 02:57:40.980]   Thank you all so much for tuning in
[02:57:40.980 --> 02:57:43.060]   and stay tuned for the fourth hour
[02:57:43.060 --> 02:57:45.860]   with a very phenomenal guest host
[02:57:45.860 --> 02:57:46.420]   coming up.
[02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:48.020]   And thanks for watching.
[02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:49.380]   Remember, Alex coming up at
[02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:50.580]   seven o'clock tonight.
[02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:51.300]   We'll see you later.
[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:55.380]   I know most of you realize this,
[02:57:55.380 --> 02:57:56.180]   but I'm going to say it again
[02:57:56.180 --> 02:57:57.060]   very, very clearly.
[02:57:57.060 --> 02:58:00.660]   You are just as important as I am
[02:58:00.660 --> 02:58:02.340]   or the rest of the crew at Info Wars.
[02:58:02.340 --> 02:58:04.420]   And we are the individuals that
[02:58:04.420 --> 02:58:05.300]   have done the research to
[02:58:05.300 --> 02:58:07.060]   understand the globalist battle plan.
[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:08.660]   And we know how to take them down.
[02:58:08.660 --> 02:58:10.180]   That's why they're so upset.
[02:58:10.180 --> 02:58:11.780]   Think how far we've come together.
[02:58:11.780 --> 02:58:13.780]   Even if we were losing,
[02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:15.140]   we'd all still keep fighting on
[02:58:15.140 --> 02:58:16.180]   because it's the right thing to do
[02:58:16.180 --> 02:58:18.900]   against the truly satanic forces
[02:58:18.900 --> 02:58:19.940]   of the New World Order
[02:58:19.940 --> 02:58:21.780]   who've really taken the mask off.
[02:58:21.780 --> 02:58:24.500]   The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:25.860]   But you'd already chosen to fight
[02:58:25.860 --> 02:58:28.260]   the corruption and to stand with God
[02:58:28.260 --> 02:58:29.300]   and to stand with the unborn.
[02:58:29.300 --> 02:58:31.220]   So I just want to take time out again
[02:58:31.220 --> 02:58:32.260]   to salute the audience
[02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:34.340]   because you are truly activists
[02:58:34.340 --> 02:58:34.900]   in the arena.
[02:58:34.900 --> 02:58:37.220]   And without you and your prayers
[02:58:37.220 --> 02:58:37.940]   and your word of mouth
[02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:38.900]   and your financial support,
[02:58:39.860 --> 02:58:41.540]   this operation that you built,
[02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:42.420]   that's your operation,
[02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:43.380]   would not be here.
[02:58:43.380 --> 02:58:44.420]   We've got some giant specials
[02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:46.740]   running right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:46.740 --> 02:58:48.020]   A lot of items are 50% off.
[02:58:48.020 --> 02:58:49.860]   Please take advantage of it
[02:58:49.860 --> 02:58:50.900]   at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:52.500]   to help us fight even harder
[02:58:52.500 --> 02:58:53.060]   into the future.
[02:58:53.060 --> 02:59:07.540]   Now it's easier than ever
[02:59:07.540 --> 02:59:10.340]   to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:59:10.340 --> 02:59:12.260]   Simply go to Band.Video
[02:59:12.260 --> 02:59:13.860]   with your Safari browser.
[02:59:13.860 --> 02:59:15.460]   Then you click the share button
[02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:17.060]   at the bottom of the screen.
[02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:18.180]   When the menu comes up,
[02:59:18.180 --> 02:59:20.580]   you simply click add to home screen.
[02:59:20.580 --> 02:59:22.820]   It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:59:22.820 --> 02:59:24.420]   I suggest Band.Video.
[02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:27.220]   You will now have Band.Video app
[02:59:27.220 --> 02:59:28.340]   on your home screen,
[02:59:28.340 --> 02:59:29.540]   despite the fact that Tim Cook
[02:59:29.540 --> 02:59:30.420]   tried to stop it.
[02:59:30.420 --> 02:59:31.860]   The globalists think you're lazy,
[02:59:31.860 --> 02:59:33.300]   but by taking a little bit of action,
[02:59:33.300 --> 02:59:34.580]   you can override them,
[02:59:34.580 --> 02:59:35.700]   have the app,
[02:59:35.700 --> 02:59:37.380]   and then tell others about it
[02:59:37.380 --> 02:59:38.900]   so they can get the app.
[02:59:38.900 --> 02:59:39.700]   So it's up to you
[02:59:39.700 --> 02:59:41.300]   whether you want to defy big tech
[02:59:41.300 --> 02:59:43.060]   and click the share buttons below
[02:59:43.060 --> 02:59:44.500]   on your email, on Facebook,
[02:59:44.500 --> 02:59:45.620]   on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:59:45.620 --> 02:59:46.740]   However you want,
[02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:48.580]   be sure and share Band.Video.
[02:59:50.180 --> 02:59:52.900]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:52.900 --> 03:00:09.460]   Regrets, I've had a few.
[03:00:09.460 --> 03:00:16.180]   But then again, too few to mention.
[03:00:18.260 --> 03:00:24.580]   I did what I had to do.
[03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:28.740]   Saw it through without exemption.
[03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:34.980]   I planned each charted course.
[03:00:34.980 --> 03:00:37.380]   Each capital.
[03:00:37.380 --> 03:00:38.180]   Welcome back.
[03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:39.380]   I am Larry Johnson,
[03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:40.180]   former Penn State,
[03:00:40.180 --> 03:00:41.380]   former Kansas City chief,
[03:00:41.380 --> 03:00:44.020]   hosting the fourth hour
[03:00:44.020 --> 03:00:44.980]   Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:44.980 --> 03:00:46.820]   And if I told you I was going from
[03:00:46.820 --> 03:00:48.260]   playing in the National Football League
[03:00:48.260 --> 03:00:50.900]   to actually being and appearing
[03:00:50.900 --> 03:00:52.260]   on Alex Jones Show,
[03:00:52.260 --> 03:00:54.100]   I would pretty much told you,
[03:00:54.100 --> 03:00:54.980]   you're right.
[03:00:54.980 --> 03:00:55.620]   So yeah, right.
[03:00:55.620 --> 03:00:57.060]   I pray to told you like about time
[03:00:57.060 --> 03:00:58.660]   because since I've always been outspoken,
[03:00:58.660 --> 03:01:00.180]   I've always spoken my mind.
[03:01:00.180 --> 03:01:02.020]   So I'd like to thank Alex Jones
[03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:04.180]   personally for allowing me this opportunity.
[03:01:04.180 --> 03:01:06.340]   So let's get right into it.
[03:01:06.340 --> 03:01:10.180]   This happened to be a lot of situation,
[03:01:10.180 --> 03:01:13.300]   especially when it comes to racism
[03:01:13.300 --> 03:01:14.340]   and race baiting.
[03:01:14.340 --> 03:01:15.860]   And now it used to be in politics.
[03:01:15.860 --> 03:01:17.220]   It used to be in fashion lines.
[03:01:17.220 --> 03:01:20.580]   Now we're seeing it in the sports arena.
[03:01:20.580 --> 03:01:21.540]   So Penn State,
[03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:22.580]   if you want to bring that clip up,
[03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:26.820]   Penn State alums called black player
[03:01:26.820 --> 03:01:28.820]   out for having dreadlocks
[03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:31.140]   and saying it's not what he's used to
[03:01:31.140 --> 03:01:34.980]   dealing with when he was an alumni.
[03:01:34.980 --> 03:01:36.020]   Now, somebody like me
[03:01:36.020 --> 03:01:39.380]   who has been in that generation
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:41.140]   of when Joe Paterno played
[03:01:41.140 --> 03:01:42.820]   and we couldn't have facial hair,
[03:01:42.820 --> 03:01:43.860]   we could have dreadlocks.
[03:01:44.500 --> 03:01:46.500]   We had to show up 15 minutes before everything.
[03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:49.140]   Obviously kids get younger and younger
[03:01:49.140 --> 03:01:50.980]   every day and the generations change,
[03:01:50.980 --> 03:01:54.340]   but it was still good rules that we live by.
[03:01:54.340 --> 03:01:56.500]   But the one thing I don't understand
[03:01:56.500 --> 03:01:58.740]   is how would you let children
[03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:01.300]   or that let teenagers or players
[03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:05.860]   take photo shoots of these type of letters
[03:02:05.860 --> 03:02:07.780]   and put them out knowing it was going to be
[03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:09.620]   a race baiting situation.
[03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:10.980]   I think the coach should have
[03:02:10.980 --> 03:02:12.260]   really took control of that
[03:02:12.260 --> 03:02:14.980]   and not actually let those things get out
[03:02:14.980 --> 03:02:16.820]   because I don't think it shows the right,
[03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:18.980]   it doesn't show the right example
[03:02:18.980 --> 03:02:21.540]   of how players should deal with racism.
[03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:23.700]   Yes, we got to know that this generation
[03:02:23.700 --> 03:02:24.980]   is going to see a lot more racism
[03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:27.380]   than it did in the 50s, 40s and 30s.
[03:02:27.380 --> 03:02:28.260]   But at the same time,
[03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:30.500]   this isn't the 50s, 40s and 30s
[03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:31.940]   where black players weren't allowed
[03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:34.420]   to stay at the same hotel
[03:02:34.420 --> 03:02:36.100]   when they travel during games.
[03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:37.620]   I think we got to be really smart
[03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:39.460]   and responsible when it comes
[03:02:39.460 --> 03:02:42.020]   to race baiting situations.
[03:02:42.020 --> 03:02:43.620]   And it's almost the same exact thing
[03:02:43.620 --> 03:02:46.260]   that happened to Sherman
[03:02:46.260 --> 03:02:49.220]   when they used a,
[03:02:49.220 --> 03:02:51.300]   he's supposed to have a handshake,
[03:02:51.300 --> 03:02:52.340]   shook his hand.
[03:02:52.340 --> 03:02:53.300]   He didn't shake his hand,
[03:02:53.300 --> 03:02:54.180]   he did shake his hand.
[03:02:54.180 --> 03:02:56.580]   And now you see the video of he apologizing
[03:02:56.580 --> 03:02:57.940]   that he did shake his hand.
[03:02:57.940 --> 03:02:59.700]   I think we really have to understand
[03:02:59.700 --> 03:03:00.580]   what we are living in
[03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:01.860]   and as far as the climate
[03:03:01.860 --> 03:03:03.620]   or what the agenda is when they're trying
[03:03:03.620 --> 03:03:05.700]   to push these race baiting situations.
[03:03:05.700 --> 03:03:08.180]   You're trying to get us at odds at each other
[03:03:08.180 --> 03:03:10.580]   using any, every other tactic
[03:03:10.580 --> 03:03:13.620]   to show that racism is livin' well.
[03:03:13.620 --> 03:03:15.300]   We know racism is livin' well
[03:03:15.300 --> 03:03:17.380]   and they're using these situations,
[03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:18.740]   especially in the sports arena,
[03:03:18.740 --> 03:03:20.020]   to fuel the fire.
[03:03:20.020 --> 03:03:21.300]   Now, when I grew up,
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:22.980]   we played with anybody,
[03:03:22.980 --> 03:03:25.060]   you know, black, white, red, blue, green.
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:27.780]   We used sports to bring people together,
[03:03:27.780 --> 03:03:29.940]   bring people into the stadiums
[03:03:29.940 --> 03:03:32.100]   where they usually wouldn't sit next to 'em
[03:03:32.100 --> 03:03:33.620]   for four or five hours
[03:03:33.620 --> 03:03:34.420]   and cheer and all that.
[03:03:34.420 --> 03:03:36.260]   That's what sports was for.
[03:03:36.260 --> 03:03:38.420]   Now you're starting to see a global stage
[03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:42.340]   of attacking each other through sports
[03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:43.940]   and using every other little thing
[03:03:43.940 --> 03:03:45.060]   to make it a reality show
[03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:47.620]   where we have to show that we are different.
[03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:48.660]   We know we are different.
[03:03:48.660 --> 03:03:49.860]   We understand we are different.
[03:03:49.860 --> 03:03:51.300]   We all come from different backgrounds,
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:52.340]   walks of life,
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:54.420]   but these things such as sports
[03:03:54.420 --> 03:03:56.260]   should be the catalyst
[03:03:56.260 --> 03:03:57.540]   to bring us all together.
[03:03:57.540 --> 03:04:01.540]   If you can bring up that Richard Sermon article
[03:04:01.540 --> 03:04:04.260]   that he ended up having to apologize.
[03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:08.660]   We have that?
[03:04:08.660 --> 03:04:20.100]   Yeah, saying that he was annoyed
[03:04:20.100 --> 03:04:23.060]   with Baker Mayfield's handshake snub,
[03:04:23.060 --> 03:04:24.340]   but when the video shows,
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:28.020]   it shows that he actually shook hands with Baker.
[03:04:28.020 --> 03:04:29.540]   So I don't know why he would come out,
[03:04:29.540 --> 03:04:32.100]   admit, knowing that it would just be video footage,
[03:04:32.100 --> 03:04:33.780]   admit that he lied,
[03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:35.140]   knowing that this was gonna,
[03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:36.660]   what was gonna be the whole point
[03:04:36.660 --> 03:04:37.940]   of this whole segment
[03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:39.940]   was to push racism
[03:04:39.940 --> 03:04:42.660]   in all these little sports events.
[03:04:42.660 --> 03:04:43.460]   I think it's stupid.
[03:04:43.460 --> 03:04:45.620]   I think it's childish and irresponsible,
[03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:46.900]   especially in this climate,
[03:04:46.900 --> 03:04:48.020]   but we're really trying to push
[03:04:48.020 --> 03:04:49.620]   to get people together
[03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:51.220]   and recognize each other's differences
[03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:52.420]   and move to a whole new goal.
[03:04:52.420 --> 03:04:54.660]   But I think, you know, going forward,
[03:04:54.660 --> 03:04:55.780]   we need to do a lot better
[03:04:55.780 --> 03:04:57.860]   with unleashing these things.
[03:04:57.860 --> 03:05:00.260]   Coming back, we're gonna talk about more.
[03:05:00.260 --> 03:05:01.300]   This is the fourth hour
[03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:02.980]   and I'm hosting guest host of Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.980 --> 03:05:04.020]   We'll be right back soon.
[03:05:04.020 --> 03:05:04.660]   - Do you feel that my style is wrong
[03:05:04.660 --> 03:05:06.020]   or my substance is wrong?
[03:05:06.020 --> 03:05:07.220]   Trying to fact check the president.
[03:05:07.220 --> 03:05:10.100]   - The deceptive, humpty dumpty troll
[03:05:10.100 --> 03:05:11.780]   known as Brian Stelter
[03:05:11.780 --> 03:05:13.940]   and his little weasel minion,
[03:05:13.940 --> 03:05:14.980]   Oliver Darcy,
[03:05:14.980 --> 03:05:16.660]   have made it their life's mission
[03:05:16.660 --> 03:05:19.380]   to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[03:05:19.380 --> 03:05:20.660]   And of course he famously said,
[03:05:20.660 --> 03:05:21.380]   along with many others,
[03:05:21.380 --> 03:05:23.220]   that Trump is the InfoWars president.
[03:05:23.220 --> 03:05:25.060]   - President Trump's furious reaction
[03:05:25.060 --> 03:05:26.260]   to Facebook's action
[03:05:26.260 --> 03:05:27.860]   showcases that he is,
[03:05:27.860 --> 03:05:29.220]   I'm sorry to say,
[03:05:29.220 --> 03:05:30.820]   the InfoWars president.
[03:05:30.820 --> 03:05:32.420]   - And you know what is true?
[03:05:32.420 --> 03:05:33.780]   Our audience of activists,
[03:05:33.780 --> 03:05:35.140]   our guests, our crew,
[03:05:35.140 --> 03:05:36.980]   and my drive and your drive
[03:05:36.980 --> 03:05:38.580]   has brought Trump to the White House
[03:05:38.580 --> 03:05:39.460]   and other nationalists
[03:05:39.460 --> 03:05:40.740]   to power around the world.
[03:05:40.740 --> 03:05:42.180]   And now Trump's openly coming out
[03:05:42.180 --> 03:05:44.580]   and declaring war on these globalist tyrants
[03:05:44.580 --> 03:05:46.660]   and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[03:05:46.660 --> 03:05:48.820]   So this is a day of great victory
[03:05:48.820 --> 03:05:49.860]   and I salute you all,
[03:05:49.860 --> 03:05:51.460]   but now we're in the thick of the fight.
[03:05:51.460 --> 03:05:54.340]   So, InfoWarsStore.com for products you need.
[03:05:54.340 --> 03:05:55.540]   Massive sales now,
[03:05:55.540 --> 03:05:57.220]   so we can continue on to the future
[03:05:57.220 --> 03:05:59.460]   and give these bastards one hell of a fight
[03:05:59.460 --> 03:06:00.580]   right until the end,
[03:06:00.580 --> 03:06:01.860]   until we've defeated them.
[03:06:03.860 --> 03:06:06.440]   (upbeat music)
[03:06:06.440 --> 03:06:19.940]   - All right, we almost are back.
[03:06:19.940 --> 03:06:23.540]   I wanna open up with,
[03:06:23.540 --> 03:06:25.220]   I know a controversial issue
[03:06:25.220 --> 03:06:27.540]   that a lot of people are scared to talk about.
[03:06:27.540 --> 03:06:31.380]   I would say the whole John F. Kennedy
[03:06:31.380 --> 03:06:32.740]   or the whole Jonathan Van Ness,
[03:06:32.740 --> 03:06:35.380]   the queer eye guy who came out
[03:06:35.380 --> 03:06:36.740]   and said he was HIV positive.
[03:06:36.740 --> 03:06:39.540]   And I do feel for him
[03:06:39.540 --> 03:06:41.380]   as far as his situation goes
[03:06:41.380 --> 03:06:44.580]   where he was molested as a young man
[03:06:44.580 --> 03:06:46.260]   by a church leader.
[03:06:46.260 --> 03:06:50.500]   And these types of incidents happen in this community
[03:06:50.500 --> 03:06:52.260]   and it's very, very heartbreaking.
[03:06:52.260 --> 03:06:55.460]   It is very brave of him to be coming out
[03:06:55.460 --> 03:06:57.220]   and say he is a sexual abuse survivor.
[03:06:57.220 --> 03:06:59.860]   It did happen with a religious member.
[03:06:59.860 --> 03:07:01.540]   But I think at the same time,
[03:07:01.540 --> 03:07:02.580]   we have to,
[03:07:02.580 --> 03:07:05.220]   if we are followers of God,
[03:07:05.220 --> 03:07:06.900]   followers of Christ, followers of Yeshua,
[03:07:06.900 --> 03:07:10.020]   we have to judge a man by his fruits.
[03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:12.020]   Now this video that you're gonna see,
[03:07:12.020 --> 03:07:13.620]   it's actually Jonathan Van Ness
[03:07:13.620 --> 03:07:18.420]   mocking and making fun of our Lord and Savior
[03:07:18.420 --> 03:07:20.820]   who did die on the cross for our sins.
[03:07:20.820 --> 03:07:23.300]   And I think we really have to understand
[03:07:23.300 --> 03:07:28.020]   the point of what we're trying to do here
[03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:30.420]   as far as bring people back
[03:07:30.420 --> 03:07:33.620]   into a spiritual or biblical responsibility.
[03:07:33.620 --> 03:07:35.140]   And when it comes to that,
[03:07:35.140 --> 03:07:38.420]   you cannot be a follower of God
[03:07:38.420 --> 03:07:40.980]   and try to be the friend of the world at the same time.
[03:07:40.980 --> 03:07:42.820]   And I think when you see this clip,
[03:07:42.820 --> 03:07:45.940]   you'll see it's as much as disgusting
[03:07:45.940 --> 03:07:48.660]   as it looks and as disgusting as it sounds.
[03:07:48.660 --> 03:07:52.260]   And it's something that it really angers my heart
[03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:56.020]   because if anybody wants to defend any other religion,
[03:07:56.020 --> 03:07:58.900]   you have, you well, you want to, you can,
[03:07:58.900 --> 03:07:59.780]   you can do whatever you want.
[03:07:59.780 --> 03:08:02.100]   But when it comes to Christianity in this country,
[03:08:02.100 --> 03:08:06.420]   you can always see the attack on it day in and day out.
[03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:09.060]   It doesn't in the music industry, Hollywood does it.
[03:08:09.060 --> 03:08:12.820]   And now do you see someone that we want to feel sorry for,
[03:08:12.820 --> 03:08:14.260]   feel remorse for,
[03:08:14.260 --> 03:08:17.940]   you see him attacking a biblical character
[03:08:17.940 --> 03:08:20.980]   that we all owe our lives,
[03:08:20.980 --> 03:08:21.780]   owe our sins,
[03:08:21.780 --> 03:08:23.940]   owe our redemption and salvation to.
[03:08:23.940 --> 03:08:25.060]   If you can bring that clip up.

[03:11:16.340 --> 03:11:20.040]   - I have the ability to talk about these subjects.
[03:11:20.040 --> 03:11:25.340]   Most people don't have the ability to talk about this stuff.
[03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:29.840]   They get bullied, harassed, lose their jobs,
[03:11:29.840 --> 03:11:31.420]   lose opportunities.
[03:11:31.420 --> 03:11:36.540]   To be able to want to talk about the love they have for God,
[03:11:36.540 --> 03:11:38.500]   want to talk about the most high sun
[03:11:38.500 --> 03:11:42.880]   and what it did for them in their life and their struggle.
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:45.260]   I recently turned my life back over to God.
[03:11:47.260 --> 03:11:50.260]   I know what the type of work he has done in my life.
[03:11:50.260 --> 03:11:55.260]   And so you can't be a friend of the world
[03:11:55.260 --> 03:12:00.260]   and enjoy comments, enjoy videos,
[03:12:00.260 --> 03:12:04.260]   and feel sorry and feel bad that you can't speak out
[03:12:04.260 --> 03:12:08.260]   against this behavior because it's disgusting behavior.
[03:12:08.260 --> 03:12:10.260]   That it's always Christians that is the ones
[03:12:10.260 --> 03:12:13.260]   that take the downfall in this country.
[03:12:13.260 --> 03:12:16.260]   When it comes to them speaking about something that they love.
[03:12:16.260 --> 03:12:18.760]   Now let's switch a little bit, almost the same talk,
[03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:19.760]   but now we have,
[03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:23.760]   there was a CNN article that came out,
[03:12:23.760 --> 03:12:26.760]   which was a disturbing rise in hate crimes
[03:12:26.760 --> 03:12:28.920]   against the transgender community.
[03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:36.760]   And I think killing anybody or harming anyone
[03:12:36.760 --> 03:12:38.760]   that you don't know their situation,
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:42.260]   I think it's always, always, always, always,
[03:12:42.260 --> 03:12:44.260]   always, always, always wrong.
[03:12:44.260 --> 03:12:48.260]   You don't want to come out in trash, beat up, harass,
[03:12:48.260 --> 03:12:52.260]   and do anything, do any physical harm to anybody
[03:12:52.260 --> 03:12:56.260]   that doesn't deserve it, who hasn't done anything against you.
[03:12:56.260 --> 03:13:00.260]   What you should do is give these people encouragement.
[03:13:00.260 --> 03:13:05.260]   And I think this whole rise of hate crimes,
[03:13:05.260 --> 03:13:06.260]   I think it's always been there,
[03:13:06.260 --> 03:13:08.260]   but I think there's a lot of things that are not telling you
[03:13:08.260 --> 03:13:11.260]   and being responsible about this situation
[03:13:11.260 --> 03:13:13.260]   in this community.
[03:13:13.260 --> 03:13:16.260]   A lot of these crimes may have come from
[03:13:16.260 --> 03:13:19.260]   the transgender of men going to female
[03:13:19.260 --> 03:13:22.260]   who are not being completely honest
[03:13:22.260 --> 03:13:26.260]   when they go meet heterosexual partners.
[03:13:26.260 --> 03:13:29.260]   That they're waiting and they're accepting who they are,
[03:13:29.260 --> 03:13:32.260]   but they're not telling those who they are dating
[03:13:32.260 --> 03:13:34.260]   that they're transgender.
[03:13:34.260 --> 03:13:37.260]   And I think by doing that, you put yourselves,
[03:13:37.260 --> 03:13:40.260]   by holding in, not saying that you're holding onto
[03:13:40.260 --> 03:13:43.260]   a lie, but you're basically holding in truth
[03:13:43.260 --> 03:13:46.260]   of who you really are, and you're not giving
[03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:50.260]   that other person time to really swallow
[03:13:50.260 --> 03:13:53.260]   and bring that in to if they want to accept it or not.
[03:13:53.260 --> 03:13:58.260]   Not everyone is accepting to this behavior.
[03:13:58.260 --> 03:14:01.260]   Not everyone thinks this behavior is normal.
[03:14:01.260 --> 03:14:05.260]   So you cannot necessarily go into these situations,
[03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:08.260]   the social situations, thinking that everybody's going
[03:14:08.260 --> 03:14:11.260]   to be okay with you being transgender.
[03:14:11.260 --> 03:14:16.260]   So you set yourself up for all these violent attacks
[03:14:16.260 --> 03:14:19.260]   when you're not being honest.
[03:14:19.260 --> 03:14:21.260]   Now when you come out, you obviously got to put yourself
[03:14:21.260 --> 03:14:23.260]   in a community where you're not going to be harmed.
[03:14:23.260 --> 03:14:25.260]   I'm sorry, but this is the reality of the world,
[03:14:25.260 --> 03:14:29.260]   that people are not going to be open to this behavior.
[03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:31.260]   Probably for a while now, it's going to be these type
[03:14:31.260 --> 03:14:33.260]   of incidents that go on.
[03:14:33.260 --> 03:14:36.260]   There's incidents like this of people who still get bullied
[03:14:36.260 --> 03:14:40.260]   being a different type of person, being bullied
[03:14:40.260 --> 03:14:41.260]   for being smart.
[03:14:41.260 --> 03:14:43.260]   There's ways people are being bullied for being
[03:14:43.260 --> 03:14:44.260]   who they are.
[03:14:44.260 --> 03:14:45.260]   We get that.
[03:14:45.260 --> 03:14:47.260]   We get that information.
[03:14:47.260 --> 03:14:52.260]   But you have to understand the responsibility of bringing
[03:14:52.260 --> 03:14:54.260]   it all out on the table, and I think the media does
[03:14:54.260 --> 03:14:57.260]   a poor job of doing that.
[03:14:57.260 --> 03:14:59.260]   The media wants to make this a civil rights issue.
[03:14:59.260 --> 03:15:01.260]   It's not a civil rights issue.
[03:15:01.260 --> 03:15:04.260]   I wake up every day black.
[03:15:04.260 --> 03:15:07.260]   I have no choice but to be black.
[03:15:07.260 --> 03:15:13.260]   You have the ability whenever you want to, to change
[03:15:13.260 --> 03:15:16.260]   from one sex to another and one sex back again.
[03:15:16.260 --> 03:15:20.260]   You can do whatever you want to do outside of your race.
[03:15:20.260 --> 03:15:22.260]   So this is a choice issue.
[03:15:22.260 --> 03:15:24.260]   This is not necessarily a civil rights issue, and I think
[03:15:24.260 --> 03:15:29.260]   in the media, we are trying to ignite a war of this being
[03:15:29.260 --> 03:15:32.260]   a civil rights issue where all transgendered and people
[03:15:32.260 --> 03:15:34.260]   of the LGBTQ community are under attack.
[03:15:34.260 --> 03:15:36.260]   They're not under attack.
[03:15:36.260 --> 03:15:39.260]   As far as I'm seeing, you get and do whatever you want.
[03:15:39.260 --> 03:15:42.260]   You shut down businesses.
[03:15:42.260 --> 03:15:43.260]   You get people fired.
[03:15:43.260 --> 03:15:46.260]   You get people bullied and harassed into silence.
[03:15:46.260 --> 03:15:49.260]   So I don't think necessarily things are going wrong for you.
[03:15:49.260 --> 03:15:51.260]   I think things are going right for you where you want them
[03:15:51.260 --> 03:15:53.260]   to go, but I think you're trying to engineer a war that
[03:15:53.260 --> 03:15:58.260]   doesn't need to be, and it's done on the surface of lies
[03:15:58.260 --> 03:15:59.260]   underneath of it.
[03:15:59.260 --> 03:16:01.260]   All right, we're about to come back.
[03:16:01.260 --> 03:16:02.260]   Thank you.
[03:16:02.260 --> 03:16:03.260]   [break]
