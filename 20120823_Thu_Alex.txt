[00:42.840 --> 00:50.400]  of August 2012 transmission we will be here for the next three hours and I'll
[00:50.400 --> 00:54.680]  be back hosting the nightly news this evening 7 o'clock central 8 o'clock
[00:54.680 --> 01:00.480]  Eastern the website info wars news.com or prisonplanet.tv both of them will
[01:00.480 --> 01:06.280]  we'll get you there okay wow we have got a very important transmission as
[01:06.280 --> 01:11.320]  always lined up today but even more so every day because this world government
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.840]  gets more and more out in the open we've got a lot of signs that the globalists
[01:15.840 --> 01:20.960]  are planning the stage crises at the Republican and Democratic conventions
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.080]  we're going to be breaking down all of that also they're talking about
[01:25.080 --> 01:31.440]  canceling or moving the GOP convention if this hurricane that looks like it's
[01:31.440 --> 01:35.760]  steering right for right for the convention I can see Bill Gates in there
[01:35.760 --> 01:39.080]  with the hurricane machine guiding it you know that I mean that sounds crazy
[01:39.080 --> 01:43.640]  and it's probably a normal hurricane but 1967 they had certified that the
[01:43.640 --> 01:48.240]  government could create weakened strengthen and even steer hurricanes so
[01:48.240 --> 01:51.760]  we are living in a Buck Rogers world I've had been Linux and the father of
[01:51.760 --> 01:56.200]  weather weapons on the show to break all of that down so we're gonna be going
[01:56.200 --> 02:02.480]  over that here's one of the big ones Texas official warns of Obama civil war
[02:02.480 --> 02:06.360]  it's in the Houston Chronicle it's in the Associated Press it's up at info
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.480]  wars.com it's Lubbock it's the judge and people get confused outside Texas for
[02:11.480 --> 02:18.360]  other states that have this the County Commissioner head is called a judge and
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.400]  so it's it's basically the mayor of that county that Lubbock is in pretty
[02:23.400 --> 02:30.000]  populated area pretty focused and well-informed a conservative libertarian
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.120]  types out in West Texas. In fact I was ever gonna talk about a place that would
[02:33.120 --> 02:37.280]  really actually rebel against tyranny and it's people in Texas and
[02:37.280 --> 02:43.160]  particularly places like West Texas and he's sitting there with the police chief
[02:43.160 --> 02:46.880]  we were sitting there with a sheriff with a sheriff nodding his head when
[02:46.880 --> 02:49.920]  they're talking about waiting for the feds and their armored vehicles and
[02:49.920 --> 02:54.480]  stopping them and the guy's pretty respected I mean he's not this is the
[02:54.480 --> 02:58.920]  point we've gotten to where they're announcing on C-SPAN the UN and NATO
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.280]  run the military they're announcing on CNBC that world government is here they
[03:04.280 --> 03:07.680]  are announcing we're going under global receivership and global government has
[03:07.680 --> 03:12.280]  been established and the Bill of Rights and Constitution is being completely
[03:12.280 --> 03:19.440]  trashed and so people at the state level are gonna wake up I mean the Texas
[03:19.440 --> 03:23.520]  legislature said last year we're gonna enforce existing law if you touch
[03:23.520 --> 03:27.600]  somebody's genitals on the outside without a warrant or an emergency that
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.520]  is a misdemeanor inside it's a felony sexual assault and that's already on the
[03:32.520 --> 03:37.760]  books and the feds said F-16s are on standby to run a armed blockade of your
[03:37.760 --> 03:42.840]  state and I confirmed with military sources army mainly that they had the
[03:42.840 --> 03:49.320]  tanks loading on the trains to come to Texas in surrounding states yeah good
[03:49.320 --> 03:53.920]  luck with that as if they're gonna I mean if you have the government of a
[03:53.920 --> 03:59.960]  state stand up it's over because the federal government has zero moral
[03:59.960 --> 04:06.200]  authority zero the feds are supposed to keep the states in tune the states are
[04:06.200 --> 04:10.600]  supposed to keep the feds in tune that separation of powers and the feds are
[04:10.600 --> 04:16.600]  way way way way out of line because they're not feds they're globalist
[04:16.600 --> 04:21.880]  they're collaborators with foreign banks that brag in hundreds of publications
[04:21.880 --> 04:27.040]  that were slaves and look you can run denial on people long enough and have
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.240]  them just follow authority but it's not gonna fly in places like Texas and
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.680]  Tennessee and Vermont and New Hampshire and Arizona and other areas it is not
[04:36.680 --> 04:42.800]  going to fly in places like Missouri and Kansas and Indiana and Illinois I mean
[04:42.800 --> 04:47.600]  all over when open-world government is being thrown in our face and we're
[04:47.600 --> 04:51.360]  being told that liberty is bad and small business owners are bad I mean I'm
[04:51.360 --> 04:56.960]  sorry the New World Order is dead on arrival unless they start a civil war
[04:56.960 --> 05:02.600]  and that's what this judge is talking about supernatural silver is not an

[08:08.080 --> 08:13.720]  it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:17.920 --> 08:22.560]  if you are joining us for the first time and you're wondering what you've
[08:22.560 --> 08:28.760]  tuned into let me introduce myself I am Alex Jones of Texas and I am a
[08:28.760 --> 08:33.840]  defender of liberty and common sense and due process the family and private
[08:33.840 --> 08:39.280]  property and the right to follow your own religious beliefs and to have freedom
[08:39.280 --> 08:47.800]  and dignity and I have declared war for 17 years on pushers and purveyors of
[08:47.800 --> 08:53.400]  tyranny and control freak coward ideologies and I have sworn on the
[08:53.400 --> 09:00.600]  altar of God to put all of my energy and will against the New World Order and to
[09:00.600 --> 09:07.760]  trod them under my booted feet if God be with us none can stand against us the
[09:07.760 --> 09:12.960]  globalists spend their entire time trying to brainwash and program with
[09:12.960 --> 09:16.800]  all these anti-family anti-liberty messages that you see everywhere
[09:16.800 --> 09:24.520]  television is a weapon to pacify you now people think that oh Obama he's bad
[09:24.520 --> 09:29.720]  he's the reason all this is happening Obama is the manifestation at this
[09:29.720 --> 09:37.360]  current point a signpost of the globalist themselves and the fact that
[09:37.360 --> 09:42.840]  people are rebelling against Obama is a good thing and the fact that almost
[09:42.840 --> 09:47.000]  everyone I talked to who hates Obama and everything he's doing understands that
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.600]  Mitt Romney's bought and paid for by the very same people they just don't want
[09:51.600 --> 09:55.360]  Obama to get reelected and it's the only good argument I've heard for actually
[09:55.360 --> 10:00.360]  getting involved in the election is because if he gets four more years he's
[10:00.360 --> 10:04.760]  not facing re-election and he has pardon power and Katie bar the door I've
[10:04.760 --> 10:09.080]  talked to a lot of high-powered people even liberals and Democrats and big
[10:09.080 --> 10:13.960]  corporate people and they're scared of Obama and the people that run him
[10:13.960 --> 10:18.520]  clearly they want to start a civil war in this country between patriots and
[10:18.520 --> 10:22.720]  libertarians and conservatives whether you like it or not the battle lines have
[10:22.720 --> 10:26.800]  been drawn and if they see you as a libertarian or a conservative or a
[10:26.800 --> 10:33.080]  constitutionalist or a veteran you are the enemy period because the globalist
[10:33.080 --> 10:37.680]  manipulate both sides the political fake spectrum but the real ideology of
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.460]  their henchmen at the lower and mid and even upper levels is a socialist
[10:42.460 --> 10:52.440]  communist ideology and they're a very very very dangerous force that has to be
[10:52.440 --> 11:01.800]  dealt with and again Romney is just the globalist in a lower gear and that
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.120]  signifies the fact that they're trying to get him in now that they realize
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.960]  Obama has become nothing but a liability people are waking up under Obama
[11:09.960 --> 11:14.400]  people are getting organized under Obama they're getting out of their slumber
[11:14.400 --> 11:25.520]  and the country is on the edge of a restoration the Republic is awakening
[11:25.520 --> 11:28.720]  right now and I've got some amazing news we're going to be covering but if you
[11:28.720 --> 11:32.000]  just tuned in for the first time you have found it this is the tip of the
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.760]  spear this is the most widely listened to radio broadcast on AM FM XM and
[11:38.760 --> 11:44.480]  shortwave and internet worldwide that actually covers the full spectrum of
[11:44.480 --> 11:50.160]  the eugenics the world government the master plan we go way beyond Obama way
[11:50.160 --> 11:55.840]  beyond the Prime Minister of England way beyond the puppets to the source
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.840]  documents of the globalist who have to communicate to their mid-level minions
[11:59.840 --> 12:06.160]  so they basically admit their entire program all you've got to do is take a
[12:06.160 --> 12:10.880]  little time out of watching sports and a little time out of strutting around and
[12:10.880 --> 12:14.840]  acting tough and I'm talking to some of the new listeners out there to actually
[12:14.840 --> 12:19.840]  realize you're under assault I mean I I people watch and I go hiking and I I go
[12:19.840 --> 12:24.760]  swimming the lake's gotten too hot here to swim them again in the news so I like
[12:24.760 --> 12:30.680]  to go one of the big spring-fed areas will Barton Springs and I watch guys you
[12:30.680 --> 12:34.560]  know that are big and muscular and obviously powerful and I watch them
[12:34.560 --> 12:37.760]  kind of strutting around like they want to you know start a fight with somebody
[12:37.760 --> 12:43.200]  and I kind of watch some of the lap lane swimmers who will you know kind of get
[12:43.200 --> 12:46.760]  out of kilter of where they're swimming and get over into where you're at and
[12:46.760 --> 12:49.560]  then you'll see them looking at you in their goggles they're just gonna run
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.000]  into you they're good they're gonna play chicken with you adult men hyped up on
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.600]  testosterone swimming in ice cold water that's not really ice cold it's spring
[12:59.600 --> 13:04.440]  like 68 degrees it feels like icy are so wound up that they're ready to run
[13:04.440 --> 13:09.840]  into another man who potentially you know would break their nose because I'm
[13:09.840 --> 13:12.400]  sitting there thinking well the person runs into me I'll just ignore it if they
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.040]  get mad and attack me what am I gonna do I don't want to punch them in the
[13:16.040 --> 13:20.000]  throat and kill them I'll just I'll just break their nose because you know I mean
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.280]  I'm not not my mr. Tough guy but people aggress towards me I start thinking about
[13:24.280 --> 13:27.400]  how to assault them what I'm gonna do to them and that's just a normal response
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.600]  of any mammal that's got their head screwed on straight and my point for
[13:31.600 --> 13:37.240]  telling that story is I had to get way over on the side yesterday just to not
[13:37.240 --> 13:43.360]  have people running into me and and then I was watching them running into each
[13:43.360 --> 13:48.040]  other and I was I was just watching men going up the diving board posturing to
[13:48.040 --> 13:57.120]  each other and that's what this country has become is that they love posturing
[13:57.120 --> 14:02.600]  to their neighbor they love cops love getting mad at you and yelling at you
[14:02.600 --> 14:06.480]  if you drive wrong or something when they pull you over but they don't get mad
[14:06.480 --> 14:11.560]  when foreign banks openly steal 40 something trillion dollars out of the
[14:11.560 --> 14:15.160]  US Treasury bankrupting us by design they don't get mad when they come out in
[14:15.160 --> 14:18.280]  major studies and go yeah we put fluoride the water to brain damage you
[14:18.280 --> 14:29.280]  because they're brain damage that's why and again you should get mad you should
[14:29.280 --> 14:41.480]  get angry about real assaults that are taking place but again we're given these
[14:41.480 --> 14:47.440]  cultural icons and these cultural images of what is acceptable to do but
[14:47.440 --> 14:53.400]  I'm already digressing off the point is I see men who are either giving into
[14:53.400 --> 14:56.400]  being completely emasculated and castrated and kind of get into this
[14:56.400 --> 15:01.240]  jellyfish mode of talking and simpering voices and walking behind their wives and
[15:01.240 --> 15:05.640]  saying yes ma'am to them I see that the women look completely unhappy but they're
[15:05.640 --> 15:10.040]  following the feminist liberal dream of basically a dead family and now the
[15:10.040 --> 15:14.160]  feminist are we hate you men we just want to have kids without you and that's
[15:14.160 --> 15:18.600]  being pushed is super fashionable so so you have that rotting on one end and
[15:18.600 --> 15:22.920]  then on the other end I actually aren't even mad at men strutting around with
[15:22.920 --> 15:27.400]  tattoos acting tough because that's at least a primitive level I can work with
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.680]  in the future at least they've got enough humanity left that they still have
[15:31.680 --> 15:38.000]  some power even though it's infantile and badly directed at least there's
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.760]  something left there at least at least they're not embracing weakness and I
[15:44.760 --> 15:47.880]  used to think man it's kind of silly people in motorcycle jackets bugging
[15:47.880 --> 15:53.800]  their eyes out acting tough driving around but I understand hey they're
[15:53.800 --> 15:57.760]  trying to say we're not like the rest of these people so actually get it and
[15:57.760 --> 16:03.000]  like it and think it's good because I guess you've got to take on the outer
[16:03.000 --> 16:11.640]  form of something a lot of times before you start taking the inner form on but
[16:11.640 --> 16:16.480]  I'm I've got huge giant breaking news here and I'm basically engaging in a
[16:16.480 --> 16:20.080]  philosophy discussion and I apologize let me run down what's coming up on this
[16:20.080 --> 16:24.480]  huge broadcast today and a special guest in studio but I'll tell you about that
[16:24.480 --> 16:30.960]  coming up it's amazing what we've got coming up here on the broadcast truly
[16:30.960 --> 16:35.200]  incredible information it is confirmed BBC ran the footage in New York Times
[16:35.200 --> 16:41.200]  wrote about it there's a multiple TV crew footage of it the BBC removed the
[16:41.200 --> 16:47.120]  story and removed it because it is al-Qaeda jihadis funded out of Saudi
[16:47.120 --> 16:53.760]  Arabia torturing a man going through people's family belongings laughing at
[16:53.760 --> 16:59.240]  wedding photos swimming in a family swimming pool torturing the guy and
[16:59.240 --> 17:08.720]  then making him suicide bomb making him suicide bomb a police checkpoint and
[17:08.720 --> 17:13.800]  we're going to be playing that clip because it's censored by the BBC but it
[17:13.800 --> 17:17.560]  backfired on the one in Telegraph just put the video out now with their mask
[17:17.560 --> 17:20.760]  head on it saying okay well you censored it we're covering it Paul Watson has a
[17:20.760 --> 17:27.880]  big article about it up at info wars.com I mentioned this yesterday but I
[17:27.880 --> 17:31.160]  didn't read the article and it's so big I will get into the article itself today
[17:31.160 --> 17:34.720]  it's linked on the right hand side third story now at drudgereport.com
[17:34.720 --> 17:40.120]  that's drudgereport.com but also up at info wars.com is where it originates
[17:40.120 --> 17:47.040]  from TSA rifles through bags conducts pat downs at Paul Ryan event government
[17:47.040 --> 17:50.320]  agents moving out of airports of the streets big big article I'm gonna be
[17:50.320 --> 17:55.400]  covering that and then of course our top story here today because this
[17:55.400 --> 17:59.400]  signifies that we could really turn the corner in a lot of ways because I'm
[17:59.400 --> 18:02.880]  talking to military I'm talking to police I'm talking to county judges I'm
[18:02.880 --> 18:11.520]  talking to state judges current ones I've talked to Congress people off here
[18:11.520 --> 18:18.160]  I've talked to state senators on air and this is the reason he's saying this in
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.240]  local Fox News Fox 34 Lubbock took it serious because the county judge again
[18:22.240 --> 18:27.120]  is like them it's it's the mayor of the county like a select man of the county
[18:27.120 --> 18:33.240]  but Texas judge preparing for civil war of obama reelected well really it
[18:33.240 --> 18:37.480]  should be Texas judge preparing for American resistance to globalist
[18:37.480 --> 18:43.960]  takeover and again as more and more people just come out and say what it is
[18:43.960 --> 18:51.040]  this is where we're gonna have the victory the enemy would tell police
[18:51.040 --> 18:53.920]  world government doesn't exist foreign banks running a world government
[18:53.920 --> 18:56.840]  doesn't exist derivatives that are gonna bring it down don't exist those
[18:56.840 --> 19:00.960]  countless books videos made predicting all this the police were shown it as
[19:00.960 --> 19:06.440]  intelligence files to look out for us so the police have basically in the in
[19:06.440 --> 19:10.360]  the intelligence units and the SWAT teams and everything they've all seen this
[19:10.360 --> 19:14.200]  stuff and they're like well all that is exactly coming true show their own
[19:14.200 --> 19:19.960]  propaganda here's an example going back 15 years ago Marines would show my first
[19:19.960 --> 19:25.960]  films and army as well but some of them were like you know producers I had
[19:25.960 --> 19:28.600]  brothers and others I mean I had countless stories of these where I was
[19:28.600 --> 19:32.200]  personally told it and shown it shown letters or they would get them up and
[19:32.200 --> 19:37.120]  say Alex Jones videos are being given out you will get in trouble and you'll
[19:37.120 --> 19:42.040]  we'll get extra duties if you're caught with it and in the second time worse I've
[19:42.040 --> 19:45.760]  been told to tell you this by the Colonel by the way there's a stack of the
[19:45.760 --> 19:52.840]  videos right here I expect you to throw them away so the point is they get cops
[19:52.840 --> 19:56.120]  all over the country and tell them I'm a liar don't listen to me all they do is
[19:56.120 --> 20:02.160]  tune in and find out we're telling the truth the worst drought in 50 years

[25:50.280 --> 25:55.320]  for a tax increase to hire deputies like a one cent thing for the inevitable
[25:55.320 --> 25:59.560]  civil war he believes would follow President Obama's reelection well let's
[25:59.560 --> 26:04.440]  actually play what he really had to say because here's our article from June
[26:04.440 --> 26:09.560]  1st by Adon Salazar for info wars.com one of our in-house great researchers
[26:09.560 --> 26:17.520]  it's GX the guard experience magazine the threat at home who and what are the
[26:17.520 --> 26:22.480]  biggest dangers to homeland security and it shows a veteran with bombs strapped
[26:22.480 --> 26:28.040]  doing really and by the way that's how this works they tell somebody we're
[26:28.040 --> 26:31.240]  gonna kill your family we've got your little kids if you don't drive the
[26:31.240 --> 26:34.320]  suicide bomb and we're gonna kill your wife and kids and you know what daddy
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.600]  goes and blows himself up of course they go ahead and kill the wife and kids
[26:38.600 --> 26:41.800]  not gonna let witnesses be around they love it that's why people get into the
[26:41.800 --> 26:45.240]  business of being globalist minions in al Qaeda because they like to cut people's
[26:45.240 --> 26:49.000]  heads off they like to torture they like to murder and we're gonna play some of
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.840]  that footage and audio coming up where our government criminal government is
[26:52.840 --> 26:57.160]  al Qaeda has captured a family taken over their house they're making fun of
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.800]  their wedding pictures all of these are the heroes and then they they torture
[27:01.800 --> 27:06.360]  the guy and say you're now gonna drive this truck in and blow up a police
[27:06.360 --> 27:11.880]  station and there's another case we want to blow up a police checkpoint a truck
[27:11.880 --> 27:19.160]  full of explosives okay and that's up at info wars.com this is on the BBC
[27:19.160 --> 27:24.800]  they're like this is good this is heroic well no it's not this is the type of
[27:24.800 --> 27:28.560]  evil and now they're saying in army documents we covered three weeks ago
[27:28.560 --> 27:33.440]  became national news drudge importantly to that Washington Times covered it
[27:33.440 --> 27:36.000]  Washington Post covered it but they were like oh it's okay the Washington Post
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.080]  like this is this is a good thing saying that they were training in North
[27:39.080 --> 27:45.520]  Carolina when the militia with the Tea Party links up with al Qaeda yeah when
[27:45.520 --> 27:52.680]  the Lucky Charms leprechaun links up with the Easter Bunny and a Chinese jet
[27:52.680 --> 28:00.440]  pilot from Pluto and rainbow ponies dance around and pigs fly and I mean it's
[28:00.440 --> 28:04.600]  just it's actually I I knew this was going on six seven years ago for my
[28:04.600 --> 28:07.560]  sources that's why I said they're gonna say that the Patriots are gonna link up
[28:07.560 --> 28:11.400]  with al Qaeda that's one thing to claim the militia is which is ridiculous but
[28:11.400 --> 28:14.920]  they think the public's ignorant about the militia but to say that the Tea
[28:14.920 --> 28:19.760]  Party who up half the Tea Party because I know the Tea Party folks I mean I was
[28:19.760 --> 28:23.160]  there with Ron Paul helping found the original one but half the Tea Party today
[28:23.160 --> 28:28.400]  would is so Islamophobic folks they want to glass parking lot the entire
[28:28.400 --> 28:35.320]  Middle East you know them a lot of you are them they say you work with them it's
[28:35.320 --> 28:39.560]  so ridiculous it's so ridiculous and they have the big National Guard magazine
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.920]  about how yeah you're gonna be fighting veterans who link up with al Qaeda in
[28:44.920 --> 28:50.960]  America it's coming it will happen the number one threat is veterans yeah you
[28:50.960 --> 29:00.280]  they're teaching you that you are the enemy I mean this is so over the top
[29:00.280 --> 29:03.880]  that's how dumb they think everybody is but let me tell you when they start
[29:03.880 --> 29:10.560]  staging the events or or they when they bust the the al Qaeda operative will be
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.640]  some you know 80 IQ moron with some other veteran whose brain damage from
[29:15.640 --> 29:20.280]  IEDs this is exactly who they'll look for they'll just get them drunk or on drugs
[29:20.280 --> 29:23.640]  and have them say they're gonna blow something up and then it'll be on the
[29:23.640 --> 29:30.720]  news Habib Hassan Durga Durga was planning with you know John Smith the
[29:30.720 --> 29:39.080]  the evil redneck is to kill the innocent you know people at the military base I

[37:39.200 --> 37:46.720]  new world order everything we're taught about Cobra Cobra I am Cobra commander
[37:46.720 --> 37:51.320]  whenever I did the Cobra commander skip and interviewed myself people thought

[37:56.360 --> 38:00.640]  voice talent folks I can basically be a mockingbird if I want to not bragging

[38:30.880 --> 38:34.680]  to that and defeat the globalist all right let's get serious here this is
[38:34.680 --> 38:39.320]  good news and bad news the media doesn't know what to do because this is a
[38:39.320 --> 38:44.120]  respected longtime county judge that's basically the mayor of the county you
[38:44.120 --> 38:49.640]  don't live in Texas and it's a very populous about the most populous West
[38:49.640 --> 38:57.320]  Texas town Lubbock and to make a long story short but I'll just pull Lubbock
[38:57.320 --> 39:05.360]  up on a map for folks that are watching the prison planet TV I'll pull Lubbock
[39:05.360 --> 39:08.040]  up for everybody if you want to know where it's at we'll back out here on the
[39:08.040 --> 39:15.760]  old the old Google map so there's Lubbock it's up close you know to the
[39:15.760 --> 39:20.120]  middle of the panhandle south of Amarillo here in what they call terrorist
[39:20.120 --> 39:25.200]  country Texas that's for evil people actually want freedom you know the
[39:25.200 --> 39:28.320]  Alamo stuff like that it's just basically bad people that believe in the
[39:28.320 --> 39:32.400]  Second Amendment stuff like that that's why they admitted Louisiana which is full
[39:32.400 --> 39:35.520]  a lot of good folks I'm not getting a rivalry going here they even came on the
[39:35.520 --> 39:39.720]  newspapers ago they wait on the border and when you drive in they pull you over
[39:39.720 --> 39:43.800]  and try to manipulate state laws claiming you can't have a gun even though
[39:43.800 --> 39:48.600]  you can and take you to jail and then impound your car like you were visiting a
[39:48.600 --> 39:51.720]  crack house or something just want to put that little warning out to Texans
[39:51.720 --> 39:58.240]  that that's still going on so drive into Louisiana at your own risk a lot of
[39:58.240 --> 40:00.760]  people I know just drive around if they're going to Florida all the way
[40:00.760 --> 40:06.160]  through Arkansas just I mean I gotta warn people it's kind of like Mexico down
[40:06.160 --> 40:13.080]  there with the police but anyways a side issue digressing away from that
[40:13.080 --> 40:17.080]  there's towns in Texas they'll shake you down too so let's be honest you're
[40:17.080 --> 40:20.080]  coming from Louisiana there's some East Texas towns where they're gonna rob you
[40:20.080 --> 40:25.320]  as well so I guess I guess it's just hillbilly kingdom but but that's I can't
[40:25.320 --> 40:28.200]  engage in Texas worship without talking about some of the bad stuff we do as
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.960]  well but God bless Texas and just God bless the fact that I am from Texas
[40:33.960 --> 40:38.400]  that's one of the I am I am proud of my heritage I have to I have to admit it I
[40:38.400 --> 40:42.920]  think I better shut up now it is illustrious but all right I'm in a good
[40:42.920 --> 40:47.720]  mood I apologize I'm gonna stop right there let's get serious here for a
[40:47.720 --> 40:57.160]  moment Texas official warns of Obama civil war and we're gonna play a clip
[40:57.160 --> 41:01.320]  right now and then I'm going to comment on the rest of the story what this
[41:01.320 --> 41:09.880]  really signifies here is the county judge in Lubbock County Texas here it is
[41:09.880 --> 41:15.080]  judge head says he in the county must be prepared for many contingencies one
[41:15.080 --> 41:20.480]  that he particularly fears if President Obama is reelected he is gonna try to
[41:20.480 --> 41:25.120]  hand over the sovereignty of the United States to the UN mm-hmm okay what's gonna
[41:25.120 --> 41:28.200]  happen when that happens I'm thinking worst-case scenario right right I
[41:28.200 --> 41:33.520]  understand civil unrest civil disobedience civil war maybe and we're
[41:33.520 --> 41:37.800]  not talking just a few riots here and demonstrations we're talking we're
[41:37.800 --> 41:43.000]  talking Lexington Concord take up arms and get rid of the guy mm-hmm okay now
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.720]  what's gonna happen if we do that if the public decides to do that he's gonna
[41:46.720 --> 41:52.360]  send in UN troops I don't want them in Lubbock County mm-hmm okay so I'm gonna
[41:52.360 --> 41:55.080]  stand in front of their person armored personnel carriers and say you're not
[41:55.080 --> 41:58.640]  coming in here mm-hmm and the sheriff I've already asked him I said you gonna
[41:58.640 --> 42:01.840]  back me he said yeah I'll back you well I don't want a bunch of rookies back there
[42:01.840 --> 42:09.840]  true I want trained equipped seasoned veteran officers to back me whether you
[42:09.840 --> 42:14.440]  agree with the judge or think his theories are unrealistic the reality is a
[42:14.440 --> 42:21.400]  tax hike that will provide an additional 832,433 dollars coupled with about a
[42:21.400 --> 42:26.640]  two million dollar cut to make these numbers work you can sound off at two
[42:26.640 --> 42:31.040]  public hearings tomorrow morning at 10 on Monday August 20 we're gonna get him
[42:31.040 --> 42:39.920]  on the show or at least try now here's the issue all this tax money that sent
[42:39.920 --> 42:45.560]  military weapons to the states and counties fine we'll just take it see
[42:45.560 --> 42:51.680]  it's all a war for the mind if you've got the mind it doesn't matter the
[42:51.680 --> 42:57.800]  landscape and we don't brainwash and deceive and twist people to agree with
[42:57.800 --> 43:01.280]  us we just lay the truth out unapologetically over and over again
[43:01.280 --> 43:05.280]  and say hey you watch what's gonna happen and you wait the globalists try to
[43:05.280 --> 43:09.800]  drop the hammer because we've been out there warning everybody everyone now
[43:09.800 --> 43:13.960]  knows what they see coming down the road we're prepared we're not caught flat
[43:13.960 --> 43:18.880]  footed and it's happening all over the country why do you think we get the
[43:18.880 --> 43:24.200]  Homeland Security reports why do you think we get those and I'm gonna get them
[43:24.200 --> 43:27.040]  for over a decade but we finally have enough media power the last four years
[43:27.040 --> 43:32.600]  to get them out nationally they say veterans gun owners libertarians
[43:32.600 --> 43:36.280]  conservatives I've got at New York Times articles from three four years ago
[43:36.280 --> 43:39.680]  where it shows the Boy Scouts when I first reported on this a decade ago no
[43:39.680 --> 43:44.000]  one believe me even though I had the witnesses they're training Boy Scouts
[43:44.000 --> 43:49.720]  nationwide in the Explorer Scout 14 and up that they will face veterans in gun
[43:49.720 --> 43:53.440]  confiscation and and they do door-to-door drills taking the guns I mean
[43:53.440 --> 43:56.920]  that's in the New York Times headline scouts trained to fight terrorist and
[43:56.920 --> 44:01.240]  more and it's got more than what is it 20 photos or so we've shown it to you
[44:01.240 --> 44:06.640]  probably a hundred times and it it it shows them if you click on the New York
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.240]  Times article itself we also have it mirrored up at info wars.com be able to
[44:10.240 --> 44:19.520]  analyze it taking on veterans okay so you've always been the target it's
[44:19.520 --> 44:24.480]  always been the plan the foreign bankers run al-qaeda when we say 9-11's an
[44:24.480 --> 44:31.360]  inside job we're saying criminal global cartels helped organize what
[44:31.360 --> 44:35.480]  transpired as a pretext to shut up Homeland Security that would then be
[44:35.480 --> 44:40.480]  used against America Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the
[44:40.480 --> 44:45.160]  rebel fortress by the time this station is operational we will then crush the
[44:45.160 --> 44:51.800]  rebellion with one swift stroke I think governor talk is correct anyways the
[44:51.800 --> 44:59.520]  point is that the globalist are the ones who are the usurpers they are the
[44:59.520 --> 45:04.240]  revolutionaries and most revolutions are not to bring freedom this is a
[45:04.240 --> 45:08.680]  criminal group that is trying to overthrow our republic very illegitimate
[45:08.680 --> 45:18.920]  110% and so they sector and said none of this existed and that's backfiring on
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.480]  them they sat there and said there's no world government it's not run by mega
[45:22.480 --> 45:26.800]  banks and they're not gonna implode the world economy and then you know shut
[45:26.800 --> 45:30.560]  off your power there's no such thing as a 21 now it's all happening people are
[45:30.560 --> 45:34.640]  like wow this is really everything Alex Jones said is happening exactly as he
[45:34.640 --> 45:38.480]  said it would well yeah I mean they got public white papers I mean I'm reading
[45:38.480 --> 45:43.440]  with their plans be like if I had the coach's playbook and I was in all their
[45:43.440 --> 45:46.240]  meetings and then I'm now the other team and I'm I know exactly what they're
[45:46.240 --> 45:50.920]  gonna do I know all the hand signs all of it this is this is not believe Alex
[45:50.920 --> 45:55.800]  Jones see they count on you just to believe oh I believe Obama he reads off
[45:55.800 --> 45:59.080]  a teleprompter good or I believe Romney because he reads off a teleprompter good
[45:59.080 --> 46:04.920]  he has a nice-looking suit no no no you don't believe Alex Jones you type in to
[46:04.920 --> 46:09.720]  a search engine start page dot com or Google or whatever you type in army field
[46:09.720 --> 46:15.160]  manual internment camps for Americans and you will be on the army mill site you
[46:15.160 --> 46:23.400]  won't be Alex Jones it's there okay it's there it's the equivalent of habeas
[46:23.400 --> 46:30.120]  corpus show me the crime show me the body I'm saying dig in that backyard you're
[46:30.120 --> 46:34.880]  gonna dig up bodies you dig deep they're there like these bodies aren't even five
[46:34.880 --> 46:39.240]  feet under the ground they're on the surface laying there this is just
[46:39.240 --> 46:43.760]  waiting for you to go discover this waiting for you to realize the treason
[46:43.760 --> 46:47.400]  and are we just gonna sit there and let the big government buildings and the F
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.720]  16s all intimidate us those are all being flown by Americans by people that
[46:51.720 --> 46:55.440]  love freedom on average until the drones are in place that's what the globalist
[46:55.440 --> 47:00.680]  are racing announcing I start putting robots on the streets even primitive
[47:00.680 --> 47:04.160]  ones that basically just have cameras and weapons on them to acclimate you
[47:04.160 --> 47:10.720]  because they they cannot count on their own people anymore that's why TSA is now
[47:10.720 --> 47:13.760]  trying to hire outright criminals oh they run the background checked all right
[47:13.760 --> 47:20.280]  to make sure they're a criminal you see tyranny rots very quickly once you get
[47:20.280 --> 47:24.360]  to a certain point you go downhill three or four times faster than you were
[47:24.360 --> 47:29.880]  just a second ago you start racing and we're now hitting that racing point but
[47:29.880 --> 47:36.120]  we're seeing the immune system kicked in because everybody I know successful in
[47:36.120 --> 47:41.160]  business in literature in art and you name it a lot of amazing people live in
[47:41.160 --> 47:44.840]  Austin than I get to meet and know over the years they are all not just
[47:44.840 --> 47:49.080]  intellectually but in their gut just running around in circles trying to do
[47:49.080 --> 47:56.120]  something right now because they know everybody knows in their gut
[47:58.520 --> 48:04.800]  you know it's the strangest thing sometimes I it only happens like once a
[48:04.800 --> 48:08.760]  year or something the phone will ring my wife calls all the time on the hotline
[48:08.760 --> 48:14.120]  two or three times a day but the hotline will have a bad feeling and I'll
[48:14.120 --> 48:17.240]  know it's bad news when I picked the phone up when one of the kids falls off
[48:17.240 --> 48:21.400]  the porch and you know cuts their head open or whatever
[48:21.400 --> 48:26.200]  uh-huh go ahead and give me the bad news we've got that folks but you don't even
[48:26.200 --> 48:28.760]  need your sixth sense to know what's going on here
[48:28.760 --> 48:34.760]  it's ridiculous we're the plum of the globalist we're that plum that brass
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.600]  ring that jewel that that ring of power they fully
[48:38.600 --> 48:44.200]  get this country under their control the world better look out because they
[48:44.200 --> 48:47.640]  plan to use us as a battering ram against every other nation whether that
[48:47.640 --> 48:51.720]  nation be good or bad it doesn't matter we are now a captured system and now
[48:51.720 --> 48:54.760]  they're telling us torture is good and secret arrest is good and yeah we are
[48:54.760 --> 48:57.880]  spot on you without warrants and you know what it did now kind of it's good
[48:57.880 --> 49:02.840]  old boys under the terrorist it's happening
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.920]  it's happening right now and it's time to have a gut check
[49:08.920 --> 49:12.680]  hundreds of publications brag that we've been captured by foreign banks
[49:12.680 --> 49:17.800]  and so it's not just me saying this under law under
[49:17.800 --> 49:22.200]  organic common law under our constitution under international law
[49:22.200 --> 49:25.480]  we have right to revolt
[49:26.600 --> 49:31.960]  but i say don't play into their hands of physical confrontation
[49:31.960 --> 49:36.680]  because most people are just dumbed down zombies following a brainwashing
[49:36.680 --> 49:40.360]  template the fight is in the info war that's why the
[49:40.360 --> 49:42.840]  globalists want to kick off a physical conflict
[49:42.840 --> 49:46.760]  because we're going to have a velvet revolution here of ideas
[49:46.760 --> 49:51.320]  if we continue on this trajectory we're winning
[49:51.320 --> 49:54.920]  the churches or government run telling you it's the end of the world
[49:54.920 --> 50:01.160]  and they tell the new ages is 2012 so everybody stands down in the takeover
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.840]  but our forebears didn't stand down
[50:04.920 --> 50:08.120]  we're not going to stand down and even if it was the end of the world
[50:08.120 --> 50:11.320]  god isn't going to let you into those pearly gates i will assure you
[50:11.320 --> 50:14.680]  if you didn't stand against evil while you were here this is a test
[50:14.680 --> 50:18.200]  make no mistake and you better be worried about your eternal soul
[50:18.200 --> 50:21.800]  and if atheist i see your comments on youtube get mad by that give me a break
[50:21.800 --> 50:27.640]  okay i got my faith i'm not getting in the way of what you believe in
[50:31.400 --> 50:34.120]  let me tell you the new world order believes in a god and let me tell you
[50:34.120 --> 50:37.000]  it's a nasty god
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.280]  they don't want you to think anything's out there so you don't realize there's
[50:40.280 --> 50:44.600]  a lot going on in this world that can't be explained
[50:44.600 --> 50:48.600]  there's a lot of things in this world that aren't just in your little books
[50:48.600 --> 50:51.640]  we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen straight ahead

[55:21.000 --> 55:23.560]  bottom of the next hour because we just set up
[55:23.560 --> 55:27.400]  syrian girl who comes from a prominent exiled syrian family who's actually
[55:27.400 --> 55:30.680]  anti-assad but also don't want al-qaeda killing
[55:30.680 --> 55:33.560]  everybody and everything she's been covering the last
[55:33.560 --> 55:37.080]  eight months has been proven completely documented and they're getting ready for
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.640]  a stage chemical false flag to blame it on
[55:39.640 --> 55:44.200]  Assad and again we're not saying Assad's good but he's an angel compared to al-qaeda
[55:44.200 --> 55:49.240]  a veritable angel he's an angel compared to his dad
[55:50.280 --> 55:55.080]  even steve pechenick who was arrested by his dad has set that on the show
[55:55.080 --> 56:00.280]  see pechenick who had a black ops state department over the cia
[56:00.280 --> 56:04.840]  by the way he's going to be on the show i know some of you don't like him i
[56:04.840 --> 56:07.160]  understand that the point is he's a really
[56:07.160 --> 56:12.760]  interesting serious deep level person deep inside the secret state
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.920]  who comes on this show so we can learn a lot from him
[56:16.920 --> 56:19.560]  even though obviously when he's on he's got an agenda
[56:19.560 --> 56:23.000]  we'd be fools not to know that it's just important to talk
[56:23.000 --> 56:27.240]  and to learn things that's what we do we learn things by what
[56:27.240 --> 56:30.520]  questions people don't answer or how they answer them
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.160]  we immerse ourselves in the intelligence so that we may learn
[56:35.160 --> 56:39.560]  and develop a palette and a nose for what's real
[56:39.560 --> 56:45.400]  and only immersion in info war will give you that full spectrum
[56:45.400 --> 56:52.040]  awareness which is only a tiny glimmer of the overall potential of humanity but
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.480]  by full spectrum awareness you're at least realizing that there's
[56:55.480 --> 57:00.040]  a compendium of information all around you
[57:01.800 --> 57:06.360]  i want to get your take on this judge specifically on this question when we

[57:16.200 --> 57:19.080]  raised and being told we're under world government and having the supreme court
[57:19.080 --> 57:22.200]  justices four of them say that they're going to follow orders from the world

[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.240]  martial law and you an invasion but it won't be that exactly and i'll explain
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.360]  that after the break but let's start going to some of your phone calls
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.960]  and we'll get into al-qaeda
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:02:00.120]  ransacking homes doing horrible things torturing people and then making them
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.840]  suicide bomb
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:09.400]  or they kill their family in the propaganda piece but i researched it
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.280]  more they don't they don't even tell you that they say oh they told him your
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.480]  you go free just drive this truck well the guy obviously knew and got out so
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.320]  didn't blow up the police but
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.840]  they don't tell you that in these cases but it came out later in a side issue
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.240]  that they threatened to kill their family that still lives in the village
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:30.760]  where al-qaeda has occupied and they tell daddy after torturing him you're
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.800]  going to go do this or you're dead
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.640]  when who knows the loving al-qaeda will do to the families in the village now i'm
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.920]  sure it'll be something maybe al-qaeda should be given a peace price in fact
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.040]  i'm going to nominate al-qaeda for a peace price i mean they gave one to
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.520]  obama and al-qaeda were told is valiant and loving and good and
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.760]  hiding in our underwear so the tsa well has to you know do do what they do best
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.320]  sharon in west virginia you're on the air go ahead
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.880]  yeah alex thanks for taking my call and thanks for getting the news out to us
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.040]  it really sounds to me like they're ramping up their plan
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:11.800]  to clamp down on us and i believe that we are living in a police state
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:16.280]  but right now we need more than ever to embrace our police
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:22.840]  and our military and wake them up no it's an emergency situation because if we
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.720]  don't there's going to probably be a civil war
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.360]  and they'll be committed against us and then we're going to have no choice but
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.000]  to defend ourselves so it's either wake them up
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.360]  or things won't look good go ahead yeah we've got to talk to our troops or
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.760]  any friends in the police department we have
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.320]  any family members that are in the military we need to talk to them
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.560]  you can't jam it down their throat like a a starving dog
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.560]  will take a bone from your hand but if you try to jam it down his throat
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.560]  he's going to spit it back out at you and my experience it's best to just
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:00.520]  hammer people with info and and because if they're not if they don't already
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.800]  know something's wrong they just need that confirmation and support
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.840]  we need to get the buzz going and the buzz is going against this tyranny but
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.560]  we need it to explode and race across the country
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.000]  in peaceful resistance to the foreign occupational takeover
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.520]  then we can start arresting the globalist once we ever get to that point
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:21.320]  they push too far well we could look the fast and furious thing
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.680]  could lead right through all their ranks right through the ranks of all the
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.800]  criminals we can arrest thousands of them just off that
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.040]  go ahead Iceland get bounty hunters to go after the banksters
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.160]  yes is that true yeah 400 000 Vikings
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.320]  how can we do that wouldn't that be a great place well we have to wake up
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.000]  yeah we have to be smart enough see the Icelanders hadn't been drinking fluoride
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.200]  they put fluoride in there to brain damages i mean harvard admits it i mean
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.800]  they assault us these are these people are beyond criminal and you
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.880]  notice they they poison everybody cops military bureaucrats fbi

[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.800]  romney's a globalist as well but the fact that more and more people are
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.480]  talking like this this is a pretty big you know county big city out there
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.240]  one of the biggest in west texas and it just shows this is the type of info
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.120]  i'm getting from police military uh on and off the air
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.560]  and just amazing sources at the state house i've talked to
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:23.160]  state senators off the record that say look we know what's going on we hate the
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.000]  new world order uh and they know john warren defense authorization
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.760]  act is designed to use fema and the regular big army
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.640]  against the states if the states say no to tyranny
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.120]  the federal government has been seized by foreign banking cartel
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.400]  i mean it's that simple in fact i've played this probably 50 times
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.080]  the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what i want to
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.880]  address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it one
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.400]  world the central bankers in charge jim jim yorio
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.400]  you say we've got some downside here a correction in the markets fine
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.560]  but aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do aren't we
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.840]  all just counting on the fact that there's a bernanke putt
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.960]  putt and that we won't go any lower than say
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:11.160]  uh five percent down from here of course we are because if we look at the
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.040]  economic data there's nothing to get excited about in that
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.960]  so we you know yesterday we saw okay reluctance and they go on through the
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.240]  other four guests that saying we're under foreign banks here's how they took over
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.000]  hey you got to congratulate how good they were at taking over yeah
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.120]  would you be mad at the russians were doing this yeah you'd be up in arms
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.240]  today would you be mad at the chinese yeah you'd be up in arms today would you
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.400]  be mad if the germans did this yeah you'd be up in arms if mexico could do
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.400]  this would you'd be up in arms we don't need to get up in arms
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.480]  we don't want to get up in arms we just stop falling back that oh we're just
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.840]  going to wait and you know we're going to wait till they try to march down our
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.640]  street and then when the un comes down our road our police are going to fight
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.440]  with them they're not going to come in blue helmets
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.200]  that's why they've unified our military with the un with blue
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.960]  dark blue berets and black berets mainly black berets
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.880]  they're unifying the command structures they're unifying the police codes
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.240]  they're trying to head this off by federalizing the police right now
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.960]  they're giving police uh if they're special and in the right units but soon
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:18.120]  it'll be all of them little federal ID cards it's all happening
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.320]  the federal government got taken over this is elementary
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.240]  the federal government got taken over and i i know you know this is
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.600]  regular listeners but we've got to go talk to our neighbors like they're five
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.160]  years old and go let me explain what happened far and mega banks
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:37.720]  the ones that brag they've conquered the world here's a free info wars magazine
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.920]  that has all their quotes in an article called bankers
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.760]  have conquered the united states here's links to the videos where they say it
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.840]  they explain how they created 1500 trillion in fake paper
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.040]  had government signed on to the debt that isn't even our debt
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.520]  to hold us hostage and then their agenda is called agenda 21
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.680]  which means total takeover of society and turning us into poor prisoners
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.520]  basically in their words they call it a prison planet
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.280]  that's why at prisonplanet.com they say we need to go to a
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.080]  Chinese style control system a prison planet
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.000]  so we fight a prison planet with the info war
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.040]  and here we are now and they're getting ready to really implode the economy but
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.120]  they don't want to do it until they think everyone is prepared
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:30.360]  for it and then they can pose as the saviors in the reorganization of the
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.000]  country more than half the nation in their official
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.320]  un maps we just showed one on screen will be off limits that these maps were
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.720]  shown in congress in 1993 and put those back on screen
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.680]  core reserves little or no human use buffer zones highly regulated use
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:52.200]  and by the way that map in 92 the area right outside austin where they have it
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.200]  in red is the area they stole from ranchers and people
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.320]  took away from them but then built on it themselves later
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.640]  i mean i mean this is that they're doing this okay they're following a plan
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:08.680]  a recipe be like if my wife said hey will you stop by
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.160]  Whole Foods on the way home i need this this and that
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:17.000]  you know need some type of fish need you to get some ginger need you to get
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.280]  some of this sauce oh you're making my favorite fish yes
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.880]  i need you to get some broccoli need you to get some
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.720]  cauliflower whatever the case is give them some artichoke hearts and then i come
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.840]  home and she's got a recipe and she sits there and cooks it
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.360]  so you know we're watching the new world order takeover they they even tell us
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.960]  what the recipe is cut off the resources poses saviors
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.080]  get everybody fighting with each other on racial and religious issues
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.000]  while the corporate banksters rule over us and shut down our economy
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.880]  in phases while posing as saviors so a bunch of mega monopoly corporations can
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.640]  take over who are anti free market
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.680]  now i know i say that almost every day here on the show and i'm going to
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:02.440]  continue to say that i'm going to continue to warn you
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.520]  because that's it that's the game plan and if we don't get that out to people
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.120]  it's over it's over
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.960]  this isn't just a takeover financially they want to physically
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.920]  once and for all have a war with the american people
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.080]  using police and military who they hate with a passion while they sit offshore
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.640]  we all kill each other and just wear each other out the economy breaks down
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:29.000]  further they blame the economy imploding on the civil war
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.360]  slash race war while the globalists sit there with their controlled media
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:40.520]  that's government finance with your tax money telling you
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:45.240]  how great they are and how they're trying to stop all the problems
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:48.040]  maybe like a fire department that set fire to your house and then came over
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.720]  to your house and said oh look we put it out for you that's why you pay us
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.320]  that's why fire departments actually started in uh rome can look it up
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.200]  julia caesars family became prominent and wealthy but
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.240]  and kind of put him into where he was uh early on because they had run one of
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:06.920]  the main fire departments and was private and you had to pay
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.480]  it protection money or they'd burn down your neighborhood
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.400]  that's people think the italian mafia invented that a hundred years ago in
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.600]  new york where they'd say pay us protection or somebody's
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.240]  going to burn down your grocery store that came from
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.600]  italy and they didn't they didn't get it from the
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:31.800]  black nobility a thousand years ago on the west coast of italy no they got it
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:37.880]  that's like 2200 years old okay 2200 years old
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.320]  i mean that's what government turns into when it's criminal
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.840]  let us take your rides or al-qaeda is going to kill you well hey you run al-qaeda
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.440]  here's all the proof shut up conspiracy theorists but wait it's on the news
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.640]  that you run al-qaeda
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:56.280]  and look at this national guard magazine cover the threat at home and it says
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:00.600]  veterans it's teaching the military to fight themselves
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.520]  now when you're 25 years old and in the army or in the national guard
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:07.640]  30 years old you know five years from now sounds like a long time
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:12.520]  but five years goes about about 10 seconds and now oh you're the bad guy
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:16.440]  while they have this overlay propaganda about oh let's have rock concerts for
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.720]  the wounded veterans oh let's raise some money and give them a
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.640]  college tuition oh we love the veterans we love them
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.040]  they're the number one threat prepare to arrest them and take their second
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.760]  amendment and lock them up in psych wards they do anything wrong
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.200]  speaking of that then we'll go to your calls
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.520]  first amendment violated his facebook assist police and pre-crime investigations
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.840]  now i'm going to be honest with you about this
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:43.480]  we began reporting on this sunday when it first happened and you notice info
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.720]  warshot commas are veiled by homeland security
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:49.480]  that's come out in four-year documents and been national news

[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.000]  in this particular incident he's never been on any kind of medication or drugs
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.680]  he's a decorated marine yeah combat marine that's why they've got his father
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.720]  scared of him a bunch of combat he's seen now the point is is that on his giant
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.400]  facebook now it's turning out somebody else
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.200]  responding to him posted part of a song about sharpening the axe some song
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.880]  lyrics and and the fbi came with the police in front of
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.240]  his family who videotaped it and thank god he didn't resist so that it killed
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.680]  him and just took him off to a mental institution and committed him the
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.400]  government did and now the rutherford institute
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.040]  is suing and trying to get him out they're having a hearing right now
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:29.480]  and so he first did all this on august 13th well they came and grabbed him a
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.840]  few days later and i'll be honest you know we
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.080]  reported on it but i i thought well maybe they know
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.880]  just you know i'm still giving them benefit of the doubt just a little bit
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:41.640]  should not not that i know it won't be evil and bad in the final equation but
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.560]  i still just can't have that be a default so i i said yeah it looks
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.040]  bad looks bad we wrote articles about it
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:51.160]  then we started learning other talk show hosting people that we've had articles
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.800]  and infor words about you you've heard of here on the show
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.320]  who's saying things even milder like the hammers coming down i'm buying more
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.640]  guns to protect myself they come and grab them

[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.640]  going to try to come at us well it doesn't look like it this is what's
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:11.720]  happening uh is via is via
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.360]  uh saying we're mentally ill if we say there's a tyranny
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.560]  and the one reason they said the fact that he believed the government stages
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:21.240]  terror attacks is a sign of mental illness that was in the court filings
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.640]  now we're we're now getting all the court filings that

[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.920]  the years and they've all tasted pretty bad I tried one world way and found it
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.880]  to be delicious after 10 weeks on one world way my wife
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.640]  commented you have more muscles and your leaner than when you were 20 years old
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:18.200]  my body has changed dramatically I'm a cyclist normally I'll ride two days on
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.400]  and take two days off after being on one world way
[01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:25.640]  I rode 10 days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.760]  servings of one world way and then work out at the gym for another
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.960]  hour and a half I just couldn't believe these results
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.040]  my normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone

[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.960]  using those terms that's what it is as soon as the the ministry of love police
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.800]  released him out of the ministry of truth because war is peace and
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.760]  slavery's a good thing according to them I want to get him on it turned out
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.440]  McBreen is already in contact with the lady that the family gave the video to
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.200]  they're scared of the feds but they're listeners they're all listeners
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.840]  of course he's a listener and I just knew it
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.440]  and so we're gonna try to get them on the show as soon as they get him out of
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:02.760]  the lunatic asylum totally cogent totally focused
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.200]  it's some lyrics from a song about sharpening an axe
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.760]  I mean the globalists are sharpening their axe for America foreign banks the
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.600]  courts are ruling foreign banks can take your bank account
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.480]  and just keep your money now I mean it's their criminals
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:23.800]  their criminals and just like in other countries the police and military need
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.400]  to recognize this let's go to John in Texas
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.040]  then we'll go to everybody else that's holding um
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:34.920]  go ahead John you're on the air hey there mr. Jones
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:40.440]  hey I uh I'm a veteran from oh I have three I was a combat
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.840]  medic with five seven cavalry and third in particular vision
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:49.880]  I uh I've been leaning to call for a while but uh I worked the night shift so
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:54.920]  it's a little hard to do but uh and this is a little off the topic but
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:26:00.520]  uh I wanted to let you know how the military treats their soldiers uh
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:07.000]  or former soldiers um I've been working for the past six
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.480]  almost seven years uh to to better myself and get back into the medical
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:18.360]  field and uh they uh they really make it hard on you
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:24.360]  but um all that aside uh there were some things that uh
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:29.160]  that happened overseas I was labeled uh with uh
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:37.240]  severe PTSD um by three VA psychiatrists uh
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.840]  therefore I probably won't be able to own a
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:46.600]  uh firearm um but all you do is go buy one at a gun
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:51.960]  show you don't own firearms well I I'd like to say that uh
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:27:00.440]  my wife owns some firearms but you know that all that aside
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:03.480]  uh you know we did some things that were
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:09.800]  they were pretty heinous and um and I'd like to get more in depth with you if
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.960]  possible I'll just tell us what you did that was heinous
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:18.760]  um okay well I'll tell you what uh when I was in Iraq um
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.680]  I had asked for time off my fiance was cheating on me with my best friend my
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.360]  dad was put me in 17 grand worth of debt um
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.840]  as well as I was having some some severe nightmares and and stuff like that on my
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:35.640]  four hours off uh we were doing 20 hours on and and uh
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.160]  seven days a week um what happened was I wound up using some
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.840]  some morphine and uh I have a VA psychiatrist saying that it was self
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.040]  medication uh however I was court-martialed um
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:54.360]  with the general court-martial I was safe in 67 years to life I wound up
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.800]  Sweden guilty I didn't I didn't deny the fact that I did it
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:01.880]  uh at all but you're saying that's heinous it's heinous to have people
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:06.360]  for years on end you know 20 hours on and stuff that that's why the troops
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:09.720]  I mean it's like trying to blow an engine on a car they're just absolutely
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.000]  abusing the daylights out of the military while talking about how they love you
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.320]  all day so that's what's heinous that doesn't
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:19.720]  doesn't sound yeah well and I and I had uh I had asked for time off uh
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:25.160]  several times um and that's documented okay but I mean what's heinous sir
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:29.240]  well like I said uh I used some morphine and uh the court-martialed me I wound
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.640]  up serving a year in military for uh in a century um well listen John I
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:36.440]  appreciate your call and I'm sorry to hear that happen to you
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.600]  that's why there's record numbers of suicides with the military right now
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.440]  because not only do they do this type of stuff to people but
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.800]  after you burn out they put you on a bunch of drugs
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:51.160]  which say on the insert they cause you to commit suicide
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.640]  and then you wonder why they're committing suicide they're basically
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.160]  giving the troops suicide pills and then as they commit suicide they're
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:00.200]  decommissioning them they're killing them or as they go home and kill their

[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:15.320]  england this is big this is big uh because yeah

[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.320]  we were talking about that a year and a half ago at the start of the libya thing
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:25.720]  people didn't believe it but now it's out in the open but to actually see it
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.880]  and to see them making people suicide bomb or they basically kill their
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.160]  families that's really waking people up about
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:38.200]  totally how immoral the ruling class is beyond not caring and being mackey of

[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.880]  i have pulled the trigger on this we cannot print more because our shipping
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.760]  department cannot handle it i was going to print 50 000
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.040]  then i decided to print 70 000 of the new info wars
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:05.720]  magazine the first inaugural edition and we put 50 000 for free on the streets
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.920]  of austin advertising paid for that the others we hope
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:13.800]  selling it cost you know would pay for it i miscalculated
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:19.000]  and we're selling him when we counted our crew and and you know all that
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.840]  i was losing money on it so i went up a few dollars on the bulk orders
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.720]  so it's really yet cost we actually did the numbers i just kind of guesstimated
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:33.480]  it and got it wrong but we we sold 30 000 in the last 36 hours or so
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:38.200]  30 000 copies there are 10 000 copies left as of the start of the show i got
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:41.240]  to go check so if you want to get the inaugural first

[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.200]  okay we just aren't set up for that we're going to get a separate
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.480]  shipping department or a company to do it if this continues to take off like

[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:28.280]  and it's full of bombs and they're also getting people and saying we'll kill
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.000]  your families if you don't go bomb and that's where most
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.920]  the suicide bombers are suicide bombers are usually dead guys in a truck
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:37.640]  that's being remote controlled that's cheap technology you can buy for about
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.080]  $800 that's been confirmed or it's somebody where
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.680]  they've got their three-year-old back there you know tied up in piano wire and
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.960]  they're gonna you know they hack up the seven-year-old and go your three-year-old's
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:51.960]  dead if you don't go bomb okay that's what the CIA
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:55.640]  is because it's not our government it's foreign
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:58.680]  banker run raping children in Abu Ghraib in front of
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:01.320]  their parents army report when you shine on
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.080]  no wonder the troops are committing suicide
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.440]  the propaganda isn't real they're treated like dirt
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:14.040]  on top of it we're in we've got totally wicked globalist running things i'm
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:18.200]  going to quit running joining us syrian girl is
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:23.160]  herself a sunni she's not shia it's sunnis out of
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:26.920]  different countries like Saudi Arabia in there trying to kill the shiites
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:30.760]  and so she's such a credible witness because her family are exiles from there
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:34.520]  they didn't like Assad but she's saying this is wrong
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.760]  and evil is speaking out for eight months eloquently
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.880]  and exposing from family she still got there everything that's happening
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:43.560]  she's been proven right and so she joins us to give us a report
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:47.080]  in a breakdown i know she's seen this video
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:51.000]  because this is just par for the course of the unbelievable evil
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.560]  where they say we're going to kill your wife and children if you don't do a
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:58.600]  suicide bombing and this is the heroes this is who we're supposed to worship
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:03.000]  syrian girl what is it like to see this video and to see the cfr two weeks ago
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.640]  come out and say quote we need al-qaeda and talk about how great they are
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:11.400]  is it hurtful to see al-qaeda killing people
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:15.160]  of course it's hurtful to see al-qaeda killing people and
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:21.000]  you know it's when i look at what's happening in syria i can't believe that
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.800]  this is syria i'm looking at because it's totally different to what we're used to
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:30.440]  i know that uh the middle east is perceived as this violent place and
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:33.560]  you know these sort of things are sort of common for us but
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:39.560]  it's really not and we're used to having a nice peaceful life in syria you know
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.000]  maybe we are not rich but at the end of the day
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.520]  we have our families you know we have the tomorrow
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.640]  but what they've taken away is tomorrow for us
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.280]  and these horrors are happening it's just not just shocking for the world but
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:44:00.440]  shocking to a syrian as well to see it and the fact that
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:08.120]  these al-qaeda guys you know they've taken tactics that we've seen before
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:12.520]  so what happened with this video that the bbc took down from their website
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:18.280]  that's now available on my youtube channel um they took this man they
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:22.680]  tortured him got him to admit something about being pro regime
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:26.840]  or with the like uh fighting alongside the regime
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:31.160]  and if you could see all the bruises on him and then they put put him in a truck
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.840]  and they drove him to another truck full of explosives
[01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:38.760]  but what they told him was that if he drove this truck
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:43.160]  to an army checkpoint that his dad was waiting for him there
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.720]  and that he would be released but as a matter of fact he didn't realize he
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:50.600]  didn't even know that the truck had explosives in it
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:54.040]  and they were going to detonate it once you reach the checkpoint
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:59.640]  but the detonator didn't work and the new york times video the original video
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:05.960]  it's all there and uh i think it actually got taken down as well
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.040]  from the website i just heard a tweet that's right i was just noticing the
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:14.840]  new york times has now pulled it bbc has pulled it this is really backfiring on
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:18.120]  him uh big time right now the loving al qaeda
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:21.160]  making fun of the wedding photos torturing the guy
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.520]  all of it in fact uh do you want to air it now and come back from breaking
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:28.120]  comment on it sure let's go ahead and play this and
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:32.280]  since it's for radio the video is going to stream but we're gonna narrate
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.360]  some of this where there's not audio here it is
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.440]  a bomb being prepared on the back of a truck
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:45.480]  the target a nearby syrian government checkpoint
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:50.200]  at the entrance of the city of aleppo this video was shot by reporters for the
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:53.160]  new york times who spent five days with a group that
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:56.600]  fights under the banner of the free syrian army
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:00.520]  the group call themselves the lines of tabuid and say they'll accept nothing
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:05.000]  less than the end of the regime of president bashar al-assad
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.200]  this 52 man unit is led by a former accountant
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:12.280]  and is becoming increasingly organized as the bloody battle for the city of
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:15.720]  aleppo continues
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:18.920]  we're all gonna be martyrs eventually but not for nothing taken over the
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.040]  abandoned flat of a police captain loyal to the regime
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.880]  who's left his personal possessions behind
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.480]  as well as the family photos they're also enjoying the luxuries he wants
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:39.800]  have a little class envy
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.520]  at their base the group have a prisoner they say he's a member of the shabiya
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.840]  militia let's have pause to the government
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:50.040]  by the way i mean this guy obviously they knew what they were doing they picked
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.840]  the biggest this guy looks like he's mentally retarded
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.320]  i mean that's who they do for these suicide bombs this guy looks like he
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.080]  might have an 80 IQ uh i mean you could tell when somebody
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.800]  when they talk and look at me he's dumbered in boxer rocks
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:04.680]  i mean obviously you know they're putting you on a truck with a bunch of
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:08.280]  stuff on the back it's it's it's it's gonna explode but by the grace of god
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:12.120]  god protects god protects the little children that includes mentally
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:15.880]  retarded people uh but uh let's continue with the video and
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:19.320]  then get Syrian girls take on it here it is which is loyal to the government
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.440]  and that he's confessed to carrying out killings
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.680]  he bears the bruises of a beating it's said from those who'd held him before
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:30.360]  tonight the rebels appear to be treating him well
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.440]  offering him cigarettes and a shower and he's told that he'll be released as
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:41.400]  part of a prisoner exchange
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:45.480]  blindfolded he's driven towards the city he's told all he'll have to do is drive
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:49.240]  the truck towards a government checkpoint what he doesn't know
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.400]  is the truck is the one that's been rigged with a 300 kilo bomb
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:56.280]  the rebel fighters intend to detonate it remotely
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.520]  when he approaches the checkpoint he's being tricked into being an unwitting
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:04.520]  suicide bomber
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:09.960]  but the fighters return disappointed when they press the detonator
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:14.120]  the bomb failed to explode the new york times journalists who filmed all of this
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:17.800]  say that at the time they were not aware of the rebels' intentions
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:22.920]  oh yeah right using prisoners as suicide bombers would
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.600]  certainly be considered a war crime and whilst those opposing
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:30.280]  president Assad have said they respect the rights of prisoners
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:34.280]  this video shows what some rebel fighters are willing to do
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:39.400]  gordon carara bbc news now the bbc's pulled it new york times is pulling it
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.080]  and and early on the new york times was quite proud of this this was some
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:48.440]  wonderful g-hotting that they were uh uh showing us but now they get
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.320]  like when they say they're torturing people including their kids like we're
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.400]  supposed to like that we're like we don't like that they go
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.560]  oh we'll arrest those we ordered to do it then but but it just shows the
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:02.840]  absolute depths of immorality and wickedness
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.360]  seizing control but we see the footage where they're throwing families off
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.280]  buildings murdering people burning up blowing up churches
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.600]  which really makes obama's people happy uh what do you make of
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.560]  this new footage why do you think they were so proud of it at first they
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:22.760]  thought we'd love it i i think that they showed uh the
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:26.920]  fact that uh they're organized and the fact that they're actually taking over
[01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:31.240]  houses and controlling these areas maybe they thought that they could get away
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:35.400]  with it being show of force you know as if you know the
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.720]  insurgency is winning that that's could be how they intended the message to come
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:42.520]  across but on the other hand it could have just been a
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:46.680]  mistake and once the editors saw the backlash you know they could
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:50.040]  kick took it down perhaps they didn't realize that people are not that
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.200]  brainwashed you know they realized when a war crime is being committed
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.800]  so i just wanted to say as well that this is not new
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.240]  it's not a new tactic in iraq many times
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.000]  uh cars had been found with booby trapped
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.080]  bombs in the trunk of the car and it didn't go off because it was
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.680]  found previously and that's how things these things were done well no that's
[01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:15.880]  been confirmed they were doing that in iran where they put the bomb in somebody
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:19.000]  else's car that they knew was going into a ministry
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  then they say that person's a suicide bomber when it blows up
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.760]  exactly and there was another video actually released
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:32.520]  from syria where they have this guy um they have him make a video talking
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:35.800]  about suicide but in fact uh because he's been
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:39.800]  kidnapped he explodes himself and takes them with him
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.960]  so again this video is also on my youtube channel because
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:47.160]  he's obviously going to be killed anyway that's the way to do it yeah you
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:50.440]  strapped me with suicide bombs i'm gonna blow you up i'm gonna go blow up some
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.480]  police we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen on the other side we're going
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:55.640]  to talk about what syrian girl predicted three weeks
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:59.320]  together now saying Assad's going to use chemical weapons so here comes the
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:02.600]  peace prize president with bombs

[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:10.120]  generate your own supply of electrical power folks with what's been going on in
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:12.920]  this country i don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:16.120]  vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.960]  millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:23.880]  storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:27.560]  i've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:31.400]  and if you don't have a backup system in place i've got a great opportunity for
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:34.280]  you right now our good friends at solutions from science

[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:41.480]  in fact i think it's the best deal i've ever seen them make
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:45.880]  it's literally thousands of dollars in savings remember these backup systems
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.200]  don't need gas because they're solar powered
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:51.080]  that means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise

[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:14.600]  minutes but they were long gone with our tv jewelry
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:19.080]  and my guns i kept thinking what if my family had been home
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:22.840]  the police officer said that more than 85 percent of break-ins are through a
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:26.120]  door and that dead bolts alone don't stop intruders
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:30.360]  the officer told me to go to easy armor dot com if we wanted something that

[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:21.240]  the tactical stuff okay uh let's go ahead and uh go back to syrian girl
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:26.200]  for this segment and and the next little short one
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:30.200]  continuing here getting in to the nerve gas they're saying
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:34.520]  that Assad's going to use nerve gas so now nato's got to bomb the country
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:38.840]  to help al qaeda take over and meanwhile al qaeda has thousands of missiles they
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:42.680]  got out of libya and that's admitted i mean this is just wild
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:49.480]  uh what is syria facing on that front uh are the humanitarian love bombs coming
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:54.520]  well um the dangerous thing that's occurring in syria right now is that
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:59.320]  they're arming the insurgents with uh anti-air weapons
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.240]  and you know there's already been reports that they were armed with chemical
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:08.040]  weapons so if you know if they have this level of
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:11.880]  sophistication in weapons it's going to be very dangerous for syria
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:16.760]  and if they use the chemical weapons and the government is blamed for it
[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:21.160]  that's going to be taken to the un and when that's taken to the un
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:27.320]  it could result in a either a full sanctions on syria in which syria is
[01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:31.720]  starved for 10 years as iraq was you know weakened and starved not giving
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:36.120]  uh no no arms trade no trade of any kind no medicine trade
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.040]  no clean water and that's how you destroy a nation that's too strong to
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:43.400]  destroy front on so that's what that's what might
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:47.880]  eventually happen in syria i'm not sure if we would see um
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:54.360]  direct confrontation quick in you know as an outcome in the next few years
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.200]  but it's always a possibility and you know that might actually be
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:03.000]  coming from uh syria's side because when you corner a cat
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.040]  eventually it's going to lash out at you and that that's you know that might be
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:13.880]  what what we eventually see and if that happens it's going to be a regional
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:19.400]  well i agree with you and it's it's it's just so sad to see all of this
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:23.560]  unfolding when we come back i mean is there is there a time frame from your
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:28.200]  sources in syria when are they expecting the uh the drones and the
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:31.800]  attack craft of the empire the new world order the bankers to start
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.240]  attacking to give air cover to the al-qaeda forces
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:38.120]  burning down churches and uh murdering people
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:41.480]  to the right back

[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:13.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:29.560]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:38.120]  ladies and gentlemen we are back thank you so much for joining us five more
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:43.960]  minutes with syrian girl again they're from the higher level political class
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:49.880]  that basically run out by Assad so she's outside syria but still has some family there
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:53.800]  she's not even pro Assad but she's against the country being bombed and al-qaeda being sent
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:59.000]  in to rape rob pillage and kill everybody and you see them trying to make somebody suicide bomb
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:05.240]  and now the media trying to cover this up i mean this is so immoral and it just shows
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:10.840]  how the people running our society serve no one but themselves and want to destabilize the middle
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:16.040]  east and get a civil war going you heard my question as we went to break syrian girl
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:22.440]  so what is the word i mean they're they're talking more and more about that humanitarian carpet
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:28.760]  bombing of the country well you know now that the un monitors are out of the country the diplomatic
[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:36.680]  pathways are slimmer so there's not a lot of uh uh you know at the beginning the un monitors were
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:43.880]  used to rearm insurgency and to sort of stop the uh military the syrian military from fighting them
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:50.280]  whereas uh because uh the syrian military disregarded that because the other side kept
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:54.920]  fighting them so there was no ceasefire no i mean that's on record they would do a ceasefire roll in
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:02:02.920]  un so the west could bring in more weapons yeah but because it you know it was all out in the open
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:09.240]  eventually the the un monitors being in syria became sort of uh a way to keep the diplomatic
[02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:14.360]  pathway going so but now that they're out of the country you know that the next the next thing is
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:20.360]  what it's it's going to be something else maybe war and you asked me if i have any news on when it
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:26.520]  might start or a time frame you know every every so often i hear you know be prepared war is going
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:31.560]  to start in three months time and i've heard it again you know last week but you get used to
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:38.360]  hearing it and honestly nobody knows really um syria is surviving you know syria is defeating
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:44.040]  these foreign funded insurgents al-qaeda coming from libya and jordan they're defeating them
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:50.200]  every step of the way so uh while they're still being funded you know uh from outside they're throwing
[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:56.840]  as much money and propaganda as they possibly can they're just not succeeding so um this could
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:06.520]  this could be going on for a very long time but clearly even corporatist media is having to admit
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:12.520]  that this is very immoral and that it's a fraud more and more i mean they really run the risk
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:17.320]  as this goes longer and longer and longer of just absolutely discrediting themselves even
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:24.120]  with the dumbest sheeple that's exactly right i think the fact that uh it's damaging them is
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:29.240]  it's kind of when they attack syria it's coming back and uh slapping them in the face because
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:35.640]  nobody's watching CNN anymore all of their views plummeted and uh it's it's it's uh spreading to
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:40.280]  al-jazeera nobody believes al-jazeera in the middle east anymore well you know except for the very
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:46.840]  very brainwashed or the very very extremist i mean uh you know sady arabia is not exactly sunni
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:54.360]  neither it's a wahabi religion which is a very small section of islam which is extreme it's very
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:59.720]  extreme sure i wasn't trying to demonize you because you're sure i mean these are specialized
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:05.640]  you know kind of moron groups you can even see these fighters that are just brought in uh and
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:10.040]  that's how you can have suicide jihad people who think they're even fighting for islam but
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:16.360]  then you track the money back to uh major u.s and israeli and pakistani and british intelligence
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:24.600]  absolutely no i i just um you know i just wanted to say that that's you know the europe's
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:32.680]  accurate unfortunately a lot of these people are uneducated and getting money or a salary for anything
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:39.400]  like uh fighting what they perceive to be a holy war is very uh appealing to them and that's what
[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:47.160]  they're that's what the the uh power mad uh nato powers and and the globalists are feasible yeah
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:51.720]  they're perfect mind control they're culturally mind controlled by this brainwashing and then
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:57.400]  nato just uses them no laboratory needed syrian girl thank you so much for spending time with us

[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:59.800]  thank god he didn't resist him when they came or they love bagging a veteran that's a big trophy
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:06.280]  for the wall uh for the fbi and is their number one enemy i was just showing you earlier the
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:11.800]  threat at home you know the magazine for national guard they say veterans are going to kill you
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:16.600]  they're the new al-qaeda told you that was coming and they claim the tea party works with al-qaeda
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:22.440]  now the new army report if you're a new listener that's not a joke just type in new army report
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:28.840]  says tea party to link up with al-qaeda i know i know it's ridiculous but they they want to get the
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:34.920]  public simultaneously loving the military sing support the military support having them invade
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:40.360]  everywhere and breathing deadly do you support endless war and torture that's what the troops want
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.880]  put them on prozac that makes them commit suicide and then wonder why there's record suicides
[02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:50.760]  and make them serve five six seven tours and sometimes go weeks on end in 20 hour days kicking
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:56.680]  down doors and disarming poor villagers but simultaneously they're the big threat because
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.600]  they know they're people that won't go along with world government it won't go along with
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:05.960]  turning their guns in so welcome america we've been occupied by the new world order they're bragging
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:10.760]  and they're saying the veterans are the enemy and we've got the head of the rutherford institute
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:14.520]  coming on it's going to be on the nightly news i'm going to tape it right after the show today
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:18.600]  we may even put it out early before the show airs because sometimes part of the show is live part of
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:24.040]  its taped interviews because we can't do it all live at one time sometimes seven o'clock central
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:30.200]  and it looks like if he gets out that we've been told that uh that the rutherford institute went in
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:36.520]  and uh contended that his involuntary commitment was a fraud uh and that they've been ordered him
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:42.200]  to be released but we that's all the details we have right now with the brandon robb story
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:46.920]  again the evil marine uh that dared have a first amendment and and said our government's illegitimate
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:52.280]  on facebook and then somebody posted lyrics to a song that's got sharpening the axe in it so saying
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.920]  that uh they they went and grabbed him and we have other talk show host being arrested for even
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:02.840]  milder speech disappearing into psychiatric wards having their guns taken i mean this is the new
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:08.200]  soviet style terror the good news is it's totally blowing up in their face but hitler did this mal
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:13.080]  did it Stalin did it the del Castro did it if they couldn't trump something up they just say you were
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:19.080]  mentally ill and disappear you on the other side of the political spectrum uh Ernest Hemingway
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.240]  said the fbi was harassing him and spying on him co and telpro before the name was known
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:27.720]  they said that's mental illness i locked him up and gave him shock therapy that basically killed him
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.560]  and then uh Hemingway uh it came out was being surveilled and harassed by them so
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:39.240]  hey the fbi is surveilling and harassing me oh you're going to a mental institution bubba so
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:45.160]  we had troops rallying outside the mental institution uh it's but again we're not a
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:49.400]  hundred percent sure Mcbrane's talking to the to the neighbors the person that shot the video all
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:53.960]  that right now we're we're trying to vet all this as it develops but it looks like some good news
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:58.920]  because it backed him off but how many people is this happening to i've talked to friends and family
[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:06.440]  almost everyone i know has family in texas who shoot their mouth off about obama like i hate him
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:11.400]  you know i wish he'd get out our country secret service shows up they show up at car dealerships
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:15.720]  if a mechanic i know the car dealership here in town i haven't been authorized to say all of it yet
[02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:19.960]  well actually i was but we needed to check first with something but the point is and he just shot
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:24.680]  his mouth off about obama the secret service came and said you know it wasn't you know that
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:29.800]  threatening we want him fired or you're in trouble as a dealership they didn't have any other power
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:35.400]  other than color of law to destroy someone's livelihood and that's what homeland security
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:39.400]  and all this is about saying you won't be able to travel outside the country if they say you won't
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:43.960]  be able to travel if they say you won't be able to have a job if they say this is all admitted
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:47.800]  they're playing that's how i knew 10 years ago they'd be on the street someday because i saw
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:52.760]  them on c-span break it down you're gonna have to have an id approved by them no judge no jury to
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:58.200]  own a gun to have a job to travel the cars are all going to be computerized with kill switches
[02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:03.720]  and and and by the mile taxing systems that's now being announced i told you 15 years ago about that
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:14.040]  mit announced it this is what we've got going on now we're joined now for the rest of the hour by
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:20.840]  jamie belasia uh anyone who lives in central texas or even south texas or north texas knows
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:29.480]  who this guy is he's known as the dw i guy uh and he is a lawyer very successful and he teaches you
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:35.000]  you period when the police what you're not taught in school try to get in your car get
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.360]  in your trunk it's good information for firearms anything and let me tell you they take it to
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:45.880]  jail now for one glass of wine okay but meanwhile it's five times more likely to cause wrecks driving
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:50.040]  while texting or putting makeup on and sure if somebody's weaving and driving no need to charge
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:53.880]  them with drunk driving it's reckless driving i see people all the time at 10 o'clock at night
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:59.560]  that are drunk weaving down the road good they need to go to jail but you can you know you see the
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:05.400]  drunk you mean you see it they're reckless driving but but but what you don't need a law about texting
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:10.680]  while driving if you get a text and look at it in a red light that's okay it should be the old
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:17.000]  common law reckless driving which is a serious charge all you need is the old laws they had it
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.320]  all figured out and then the officer goes and testifies in court that they were sweeping and
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:27.400]  were he's been doing all this and then that they arrested him and then they and that they did have
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:34.280]  a alcohol level boom there's a probable cause right there but checkpoints which is just training us
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:40.840]  this guy really knows how to educate people on the bill of rights and constitution dwidude.com
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:49.480]  dwidude.com and i i've got to know a lot of people that uh read his website and his research
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:53.800]  and then don't go to jail when they've had two or three beers at the football game and you know
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:58.680]  literally probably don't have a blood alcohol level but the cops still arrest you for driving under
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:06.200]  the influence not even driving while intoxicated okay so uh he joins us now to break this down
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:10.360]  but i've got to say jamie what is it like for you being a constitutional style lawyer
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:16.040]  i mean just to see the wild tyranny now where they admit the nsa spying on all of us with no
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:21.160]  warrants every count of that's a felony i mean what's happening are we becoming an authoritarian
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:28.200]  state we've already become that it's gone past the turning point it's uh frustrating it's sickening
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:34.600]  to see what's going on in our society today and what really hits me at home is that being a former
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:42.440]  austin police officer who i thought my job was to protect and to serve i'm seeing that the national
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:49.000]  um movement towards you know stamping on the rights of the citizens is being enforced through the
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:54.920]  local constabulary it's being enforced through the austin police department the westlake police
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:16:01.720]  department new bronze fools uh san marcus your neighbors guys who went to school with and they're
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:07.000]  being placed in a terrible position and the propaganda machine is also working on them
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:13.080]  the police are now becoming in who we've been hiring lately on these police departments
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:20.280]  they're becoming more readily uh willing to do with uncle sam bids although it's not the true
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:27.800]  uncle sam it's the uh impersonator you know i should have pointed out you have a lengthy bio
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:33.400]  and you really are one of the leading experts on dwi in the country and you've been recognized as such
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:38.200]  that you were previously a police officer that's why you know all the tricks and and and now it's
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:42.600]  just been set with precedent on the street where you know the cops pull me over and they even know
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:47.960]  who i am and they go mind if i search the car and i'm like of course i'm mine what's that you're
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:52.440]  drinking it'll be a topochico mineral water and i go you know beer bottles don't look like that
[02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:57.640]  well you mind showing it to me i'm like no what is your emergency but but i mean describe your
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:02.440]  your time as a police officer and how you've seen things transform and why you went and got a law
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:08.600]  degree and have now become a preeminent expert on dwi's when i first joined the austin police
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:15.880]  department back in 1979 we were known as um a really lenient department we weren't out there
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:22.920]  trying to get numbers and bust people uh if we talked about dwi cases unless you were drunk
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:28.040]  and dangerous or caused a collision or were completely out of control you didn't go to jail
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:34.040]  we called you a cab if you live close by we had districts where we worked we'd take you home we
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:38.600]  might throw your keys out in the grass because what we wanted to do was make sure that nobody
[02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:45.080]  got hurt now they're trying to make their numbers and there are numbers a lot of the dwi enforcement
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:52.040]  in texas is done under the federal step program now when i worked the step program back in the um
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:18:00.600]  87 88 uh it would come up on a rotational basis you put your name in the in the pile and then
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:05.960]  they would you know pick your name as it came up but if you didn't make an arrest on tonight's
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:12.600]  assignment the next time your name came up you got passed that's a a bounty there's no other way
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.560]  to look at it it's uh it's a requirement to make an arrest and i guarantee you when you wanted that
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:23.640]  overtime for child support or your boat payment or maybe for your beer money you made an arrest
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:30.760]  now it's gotten so much further it's frightening uh i just got back from del rio a dwi trial on a
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:38.120]  point one one breath case got a not guilty um but i had a great judge and actually a very ethical
[02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:45.640]  and good prosecutor the dps trooper fortunately we had a videotape in san antonio you usually don't
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:53.720]  but the police report had absolute lies in it he was lying on this three tour iraqi veteran uh
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:19:01.000]  and it was just uh we had to win this case to save his military retirement the police officer dps
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.600]  trooper lied he lied on the stand i've never done this before but i'm going to get a copy of the
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:11.640]  of the traffic stop i'm going to get a copy of the offense report i'm going to follow complaint
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:17.400]  with dps internal affairs and i'm going to ask them to pull his testimony from you know sworn
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:22.840]  testimony and take appropriate action i agree you want to come up to our tv studio we could show
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:27.720]  all that show the footage and do a whole news report on it and show the lying if i can get
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:34.200]  permission from my hero we'll do just that and he's very likely to agree it just saddens me to see
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:41.800]  that he'll do that on videotape against the lawyer you know of my quality and on either characterization
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:46.360]  i have to take in the oath of the court what else would we do absolutely stay there we're going to

[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:28.920]  jamie belasia former austin police officer i become lawyer defending the bill of rights and
[02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:36.680]  constitution on a host of issues but centering in and around dwi's and i have been pulled over
[02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:41.880]  multiple times even in broad daylight when i've had nothing to drink and they asked me if i'm
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:47.080]  drinking i'm just like man okay but but what's crazy is then they're nice and let me go and don't
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:51.640]  give me a ticket for speeding five miles over the speed limit the point is the cops themselves
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:57.320]  aren't even bad people the policy is bad and they're pushing this mother against drunk driving thing
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:25:03.240]  that they use as a pretext to take over society and i could tell that you know the lawyer was
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:07.400]  agreeing with me that the point is somebody's reckless driving throw the book at them but
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:13.240]  somebody has two glasses of wine and you the cps comes and the kids are taken and the mom is taken
[02:25:13.240 --> 02:25:17.480]  and tens of thousands of dollars it's a big moneymaker i mean if we're really going to make
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:22.840]  it this big a crime then they have to ban alcohol and ban bars i mean it's an oxymoron here just
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:27.320]  have bars everywhere have bars everywhere and then if you have more than two drinks or even
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:31.400]  one and a half drinks you're going to jail i'm ranting jamie continue with your awakening
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:35.320]  and then go through people's rights we've got a long segment coming up this is a short one but
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:40.600]  please continue because this is such a scourge nationwide i took that rant a step further
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:48.200]  monday during my vordyre or jury selection uh process i talked about what's that flat black uh
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:53.400]  surface made of asphalt with stripes on it at every bar in every restaurant we see that serves
[02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:59.560]  alcohol if they don't i mean people are going to drink with a meal people are going to drink and
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:06.280]  have a good time just your body gets rid of about one drink per hour that you know depending on the
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:13.000]  person but if if someone says well i had four beers they're going to jail but if they had
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:18.040]  four beers over a three hour period they've got one beer in them they they aren't uh in any way
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:23.800]  impaired and i can't believe i'm using that term because in these courtrooms here the prosecutors
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:30.040]  and the police officers start saying well he was impaired he was buzzed and i'll start objecting
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:35.480]  and i a lot of times i let him put out a whole lot of ropes so i can hang him because inch by
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:40.840]  inch it's what you were talking about a moment ago inch by inch they are taking away our rights
[02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:46.840]  through these do good uh programs of let's get the drunk uh drivers off the roads that are killing
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:52.760]  our kids well what you're doing is you're getting everybody off the road you're giving everybody
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:57.880]  a criminal history you're not only arresting for one charge you're arresting for every charge you
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:04.440]  can come up with and it gets very frustrating on my end because to be able to beat a dwi charge
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:10.120]  in the courtroom i have got to be the best and smartest lawyer in that room i have to know more
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:17.000]  than the judge the cops the the prosecutors the uh states expert witnesses cost a ton of money for
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.760]  me to do that for myself and my staff and associates and of course that gets passed on to the client
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:30.920]  my client del rio we got out of a dwi charge with a not guilty finding the judge was good enough
[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:39.640]  not to just dismiss the case he found him not guilty that man paid 10 000 to clear his name
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:45.400]  when the police officer invented the charge basically and there's no grounds for a lawsuit
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:51.960]  if we sued the police officer the deputy uh i mean i'm sorry the dps trooper we'd lose more money
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:57.800]  and i just feel horrible for people but i can't do the job i need to do without being adequately
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:03.480]  prepared uh really appreciates you bringing this uh issue out to your viewers because
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:09.960]  nobody thinks they're going to get a dwi until they're getting locked up and it's a complete
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:15.560]  scourge and like you said you can be at a meeting with 10 people and go how many of you have a dwi
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:20.680]  and half of them raise their hands i mean this is getting ridiculous uh where i don't even want to
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:25.080]  have a party at my house and have friends over i feel like i'm going to send them off to be arrested
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:30.280]  if we're having barbecue and drink four or five beers over three hours nobody's even got a quote
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:36.520]  buzz especially men that weigh you know 250 pounds like i do i mean i'm sorry beer doesn't even do
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:42.600]  anything to me i mean it's a joke it's a joke uh you can't go out and have an italian meal without
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:47.160]  having a little wine and not be worried about getting arrested generally the husband or the wife
[02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:51.640]  or the you know one of the people on the date is the designated driver you know when do they come up
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:59.400]  with this a designated driver that program i believe encourages the non-drivers to get hammered and
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:05.240]  that's directed at young people so we've got our college kids and you know people in their early 20s
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:11.160]  who are being told well if you're gonna go out and drink let somebody else drive so you can get
[02:29:11.160 --> 02:29:17.240]  completely wasted so they start developing that habit uh i see the downside of the designated
[02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:20.840]  driver program what about the statistics i want to come back and talk about this and then talk
[02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:26.680]  most importantly about what you teach people how to deal with this so that even if you do uh you
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:32.280]  know go to jail uh you're not going to beat the ride but you will beat the rap i want to understand
[02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:36.280]  that because you really are one of the most successful lawyers out there using the constitution
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:41.000]  to defeat this but first i want to talk about the statistics i've seen in fact we'll even pull some
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:46.360]  of these up five times more lightly to cause a fatality texting why don't we have a big freak
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:52.840]  out about that well we'll be right back with our guest stay with us we're on the march the empires

[02:33:21.320 --> 02:33:27.320]  if you break the law you'll hear from me i know i'm worrying for the state i'm a highway patrol
[02:33:29.080 --> 02:33:36.600]  jamie belasia attorney at law is our guest his amazing website is dwidue.com and i'm gonna tell
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:41.800]  you you know before i go any further he's a former austin police officer finish your story how you
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:48.040]  woke up why you got involved and then you know get up to that next point of um what's happening in
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:55.720]  this country and the rights that people need to know what they need to understand in 1990 i started
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:34:01.480]  looking around uh at what was happening at the police department and i was working a lot of weekends
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:08.440]  on the sixth street doing overtime assignments and it it got to be where we were just like a bunch
[02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:16.040]  of robots hurting the cattle we would put up the um the barricades tell people they could only walk
[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:23.000]  one way they couldn't a 25 year old man couldn't carry a beer in his hand and walk down a public
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:31.480]  sidewalk um i then began to see the you know the first creeping of the control that was starting
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:36.760]  to take place of our citizens i didn't like it i thought about where my dreams had been earlier
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:41.240]  in life and i wanted to be a lawyer and i wanted to be a criminal defense lawyer always because
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:46.840]  we're the only ones that are fighting for the constitution we're the only ones that walk into
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:55.080]  court every day and we fight battles over search warrants over uh invalid traffic stops lying cops
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:35:01.160]  they're out there uh my family's law enforcement but we weren't we didn't play the game that way
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:05.960]  if we couldn't get you the right way we'd get you the next time we didn't play this game of
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:12.840]  planning evidence lying um tricking you the Supreme Court has said that police officers
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:20.040]  can lie to you as an investigative tool uh i was told to tell the truth when i was a police officer
[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:24.840]  so i don't know what's going on and that just keeps getting worse and worse when i first
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:29.240]  got out of law school i started representing police officers that were being disciplined by
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:34.760]  the police departments now you talk about the dirtiest tricks in the books that's when a police
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:40.920]  department goes after one of its own they will eat them alive and then you come talk to us criminal
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:46.600]  defense lawyers and ask who are the police officers who are really breaking the rules out here
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:52.280]  it's not the ones the department goes after that's those are their golden children they protect them
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:36:00.760]  at all cost anyway it's been fascinating to watch this how the dwi arena has changed so much
[02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:08.040]  in san antonio we have blood draws every day of the year and to get a blood warrant in san antonio
[02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:14.440]  or in austin during the no refusal programs odor of alcohol in your breath bloodshot eyes
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:21.160]  and then one more thing we'll get you a search warrant the refusal to give them evidence to take
[02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:26.280]  the field sobriety test which are designed for failure and i was writing something yesterday
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:33.240]  and i was saying how is it that the odor of uh alcohol and bloodshot eyes those are that's not
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:40.360]  enough to get a search warrant but if you merely add in and he would not take the test and give us
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:46.840]  evidence in violation of your constitutional rights then that's enough to get a warrant if they
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:52.840]  pulled you over in front of your house and you had a uh legalized marijuana bumper sticker in your
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:59.320]  car and you get out of your car and you're wearing a chichin chong t-shirt can they then go get a warrant
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:05.800]  to search your house because you tell them they can't search your house it's amazing they're saying
[02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:11.080]  we're well really it's a threat we're going to jab a needle in your arm if you don't blow if you
[02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:17.800]  exercise your fourth amendment that's evidence that you're bad that is 180 degrees the opposite of
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:23.000]  what our country was founded on and what would our founding fathers say if they saw the you know
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:30.200]  it's bad enough what washington dc is doing to us as they bend us over every day us people that
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:35.400]  work for a living work hard and try to earn a living for our families but then when you come
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:40.040]  down to your local neighborhoods and see now what your local police departments are doing
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:46.360]  it just sickens me it's it's an example now they're expanding it and that was my next question
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:51.240]  in the statistics i saw it just a few months ago but um i know you'll know more about it than i will
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:56.680]  five times more dangerous to text while driving but they're not doing anything about that other
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:38:01.160]  than just saying well if you have a phone in your hand you're gonna get a ticket no no no reckless
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:06.280]  driving i mean isn't that the way to go after it i mean i've seen the statistics i mean they hype it
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:12.200]  up yeah but and there are some deaths but drunk driving compared to a lot of other things isn't
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:17.560]  even on the chart it's just a way to grab the general public a couple of points you made a great
[02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:23.960]  one earlier and i argue this all the time we have enough laws on the books we had enough laws on the
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:31.800]  books 20 years ago we don't need more laws hate crimes is a pathetic excuse of a way to create
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:37.480]  new laws to target individuals we always had laws against assault and harassment and bullying
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:44.360]  enforce them and if it's a very egregious case then give them a higher sentence within the
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:51.800]  range that we're allowed by law another thing is that these checkpoints are talking about doing
[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:58.680]  for dwi's in texas i rue the day when that happens for dwi but currently they're doing it for driver's
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:06.680]  license and they're doing a run-in around the constitution statistics we read the statistics
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:15.240]  of some 18 000 people plus killed every year by alcohol related crashes if i'm completely sober
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:21.560]  and i pick up three of my friends and one of them in the backseat had a beer and an 18 wither runs a
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:31.400]  red light and kills me that's an alcohol related death according to nitsa standards if it's it's
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:36.040]  it does not necessarily mean that the person driving the vehicle that calls the collision
[02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:43.640]  and calls the injury was intoxicated so they're using statistics to fool the people it's upsetting
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:48.840]  when you start digging behind the veil that the wizard of ours has put up what about the hypocrisy
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:53.320]  because i've seen statistics that police are the hardest drinking groups statistically i mean it's
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:59.000]  been proven in studies people can look them up and then i read about police letting other police
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:06.680]  off when they're actually are seriously drunk and then i mean how do cops engage in hypocritical
[02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:12.280]  activity how do police arrest people college kids they find with a little bag of weed when the cop
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:16.920]  themselves smoke pot in college or may even be a pot smoker then i mean it's just it's i mean
[02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:21.960]  something like 85 percent of the american people have at least tried marijuana i mean this is all
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:27.720]  just a giant excuse to put people in prison and and raise money that's right what my kids
[02:40:27.720 --> 02:40:33.080]  did the day we went out to a restaurant it was one of the mom and pop kind of a places in austin
[02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:39.240]  and i said look in the kitchen guys and and i said who's cooking the meals who's doing the
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:45.240]  cleaning and everything and they said and it was probably individuals who are from south of the
[02:40:45.240 --> 02:40:53.400]  texas border not born in in our country um when i was growing up there were a lot of blacks that
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:58.840]  were working in the kitchens you know and i i told my kids and i said you know where so many
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:05.080]  the blacks are now they're in prison they're in prison over nonviolent crimes they're taken into
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:10.200]  a system that will indoctrinate them and force them to join gangs and become violent criminals
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:16.200]  they're set to criminal prison that's correct i mean they're set to criminal college criminal
[02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:21.800]  college it's horrible uh when you go to these courtrooms and and just listen to what's going on
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:28.680]  in the court we don't want drunk drivers killing people in our own ways we don't want uh rapists
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:35.080]  and pedophiles and murderers and violent bank robbers uh out here just doing what they please
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:42.120]  but they're sending nonviolent individuals to prison without trying to help them at all there's
[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:48.360]  no money for rehabilitation there's no money for job training it's a joke and it's it keeps the
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:53.960]  system churning but the system keeps getting bigger so they're having to take more of the fodder
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:59.240]  the sheeple in this country and shove them into the machine well that's right they're done uh
[02:41:59.240 --> 02:42:05.080]  you know feeding on the black folks they pretty much consume most of them the illegals i've noticed
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:09.640]  i've talked to police i've seen the news the judges just let them go because i guess they're
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:14.280]  outside of the system have you seen that anomaly where the police are told to basically go easy on
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:19.080]  the illegals but if you're a hispanic american and had three beers you're going to jail or you're
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:24.760]  white or black or asian have you seen that well especially in austin because uh for decades now
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:32.760]  they've been a a haven and a uh dog on the east have a term for it sanctuary city sanctuary city
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:38.760]  and we were basically told leave them alone now i don't have a problem with leaving home somebody
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:44.120]  who is working hard and and being productive sure but that doesn't mean leave them alone when they're
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:49.560]  engaged in all sorts of crimes while citizens are seen as chomps to be fed on exactly and i
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:57.240]  agree completely with that but we were um leaned on that if we made an arrest of an illegally alien
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:05.560]  of hispanic descent then we were being racist and uh it wasn't true but uh you know when you're
[02:43:05.560 --> 02:43:11.080]  when you're a police officer and you know it's okay i can i can enforce the laws as they're
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:16.600]  supposed to be enforced and i can catch a bunch of trouble from my supervisors and get investigated
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:24.280]  by internal affairs or i can just go sit at duncan donut and just screw it all and in one of the um
[02:43:24.920 --> 02:43:30.040]  old sayings we had when i was at apd is no nobody gets in trouble with internal affairs
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:36.280]  for eating a donut they eventually did have an officer who got suspended because he was
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.560]  sitting at duncan donut and he and he took a radio call he he got on there and said that he
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:46.440]  had arrived at the call then he cleared the call and he hadn't even finished his his donut and call
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:53.640]  for yet so that was the one time that's happened amazing i mean i mean it's such a joke i've told
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:59.480]  the story like probably a hundred times i'll tell it briefly one night we had an it problem and i had
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:04.680]  to come up here for a contractor and i pull up and there's four police cars right out here
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:09.880]  and they're running around inside the office and the it guys in handcuffs being put in a car
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:15.960]  and i go over there i go what's going on they go hi alex and it's a woman cop put him in the car
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:19.320]  but the three male cops you're talking to me they go oh we all like the show but i want to go what
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:24.280]  are you doing in my office oh and we thought he darted in here so so she pulled in here and then
[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:27.960]  and then uh well his driver's license was expired so we're going to go ahead and i thought you
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:33.480]  arrest to go well we can arrest even for no seatbelt now and i'm and i'm going but if he was an illegal
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:37.960]  alien you let him go well that's true we're told to do that i'm just like so i start telling her
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:42.440]  hey let him go they're like now don't interfere so they were all real friendly but they're ready
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:47.720]  to take me to jail for just going hey common sense guys common sense so what if he hasn't expired
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:52.120]  license he's here to get my computer's working but they'd use that to come in the office claiming
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:56.360]  they were that he darted in here he didn't dart in here he drives like an old woman he's out there
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:01.480]  right now i mean the point is is that it's like sacred police on the american people
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:05.160]  like i live in north korea or something but then the illegal aliens are above the law
[02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:12.600]  it really irritates me now just just sticking to the topic of the fact that except for speeding
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:20.440]  and open container in your vehicle they can arrest for every other offense or allegation of a traffic
[02:45:20.440 --> 02:45:27.320]  offense a class c misdemeanor that uh remember that soccer mom in lago vista with her kids in the car
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:32.200]  that uh she stopped at her mailbox a hundred yards away like a lot of neighborhoods have
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:36.200]  him in one spot the kids get out of the seatbelt mind you that we get close to home sometimes
[02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:42.600]  and they take her to jail that's right that's just uh incredible and you know that police officer
[02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:51.880]  should have been brought in they should have been okay his skype just cut out we're going to reconnect
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:56.760]  with our guest i'm about i tell you 45 minutes has gone by so quick i've got to get him back on this
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:01.160]  i want to get him in studio because i've seen him on tv and seen his ads and i've talked to people
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:06.440]  that uh because i want to get into what you do if you've had two three beers uh you know it's a
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:13.080]  football game and you're driving home and you know the cop wants you to blow in a breathalyzer
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:19.480]  what do you do at that point because i mean i remember one time a cop pulled me over and
[02:46:20.760 --> 02:46:24.360]  it was about 11 o'clock at night i said i'm coming home from work and he goes what do you do and i
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:29.240]  said and he knew who i was and later he said that and he goes well that's a little that's a little
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:32.520]  late in all this and i went ahead and let him do it but at a certain point i said i'm not doing this
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:37.720]  anymore follow follow the red light do this do that i said look i hadn't been drinking he goes
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:41.480]  well i want you to blow in a breathalyzer and i said you know what i said you may beat the
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:44.760]  rap but you're not gonna beat the rap i'm gonna sue you leave me alone anyways going back to our
[02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:50.600]  guest jaymean continue with the point you were making when you cut out i was the the fans must
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:57.240]  have been listening in on us and now what's irritating is is we have transformed the police
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:47:02.520]  departments from to protect to serve what did they used to tell i'm 55 years old when i was a
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:08.840]  kid if i got lost if i had problems who was i supposed to go find a police officer i'm not
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:14.120]  so certain that's what is supposed to happen nowadays you know who do you send your kids to
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:21.000]  because they might start investigating why you're lost and maybe your parents have endangered you
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:28.200]  which is a felony and then cps gets involved and the agencies all do work together it's very very
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:33.880]  frightening and disconcerting what's happening amongst our law enforcement criminal justice
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:40.680]  system i remember watching that the first uh terminator movie and there's the huge machine
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:46.920]  that's rolling over the skulls at the beginning of the movie and uh i tell my clients oftentimes
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:52.760]  and in the dw arena you meet people that have never done so much as a traffic ticket before
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:57.320]  and now they've spent the night in jail they're good people that are neighbors they're us
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:05.560]  and i tell them that is a criminal justice system it crushes and destroys lives so you
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:11.000]  can't just hook up thinking oh it's no big deal um once i get into the courts then i'll be protected
[02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:18.280]  look at how many cases we're seeing now prosecutors who are uh hiding braiding material shredding
[02:48:18.280 --> 02:48:23.320]  evidence they get caught sending innocent people with no criminal record to death row and for 20
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:28.360]  years try to keep them in there knowing they're innocent wanting to get them executed and what
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:34.520]  happens to them once they're caught nothing maybe they don't win their election but other than that
[02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:40.120]  nothing it's a it's a shame we that's another question though how do we get so evil i mean i
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:45.640]  get it's a machine but i mean i would really not sleep good at night if i send an innocent person
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:51.320]  to jail and then try to keep them in there i mean how well these are some evil people we have our
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:59.320]  jury system that is the last bastion of freedom in america and you would not believe what i encounter
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:07.080]  in these juries um they say that in a in a typical criminal case but the jury summons the people that
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:13.720]  show up with the jury summons in their hand about 70 to 75 percent of those people answer the question
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:20.520]  well or is the person guilty or not guilty they haven't even walked into the courthouse guilty
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:29.720]  three fours of the people except on dwi alex 88 percent it's unbelievable uh monday and i do this
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:36.360]  in every jury trial for the most part i raise my hand i'll nod my head and i'll say drink drive go
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:43.640]  to and everybody says go to jail i say now that's the law y'all understand that don't y'all monday
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:50.920]  29 people shook their heads in austin the last trial i did 24 out of 25 shook their heads and then
[02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:56.520]  i'll repeat it i'll say i mean y'all do know that is the law if you drink and drive you go to jail
[02:49:56.520 --> 02:50:04.200]  and they almost all agree and then i tell them that is a government lie it is not true how am i supposed
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:10.920]  to get a jury that will do their job properly on johnny here if you've all been brain when the government
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:15.720]  uses our money to put billboards up and run ads everywhere lying where they think if you drink
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:21.400]  a thimble you're a criminal when it's not true it's it is driving impaired it is the reckless
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:26.280]  driving clause coming in but they've twisted the whole thing correct that's right they and they
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:31.160]  you come in there into the courtroom as a defense attorney and you are fighting an uphill battle
[02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:38.280]  from the very start it's an incredible challenge i love it but it's frustrating when the jury
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:45.080]  goes out to deliberate and everyone in that courtroom judge bailiff officers and prosecutors
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:50.920]  know that we won this case and the jury will come out in three hours with the guilty verdict
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:57.640]  because they cannot get over years of indoctrination in a one or two or three day trial they just
[02:50:57.640 --> 02:51:04.840]  can't get there sometimes alex monday i do this as well i'll say if you do not find that the
[02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:10.360]  government proved the case beyond all reasonable doubt what must you say guilty or not guilty
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:17.640]  and the answer of course is not guilty i'll have jurors in the in the panel who cannot
[02:51:17.640 --> 02:51:22.920]  say the words not guilty they'll go well i'll do the right thing i said no you have to say guilty
[02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:29.640]  or not guilty well you know we'll we'll consider all the evidence i go no let's say you believe
[02:51:29.640 --> 02:51:35.400]  johnny is innocent what will you say and they cannot say not guilty well what about the issue
[02:51:35.400 --> 02:51:40.440]  that it's better than 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man go to jail we've got to protect
[02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:45.160]  our rights of due process we're going to live in north korea that's not taught in school but you
[02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:50.360]  have to explain it to them do you understand you've got to judge the facts as well as the law and if
[02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:54.920]  they have violated the constitution and the procedures then you've got to let him go even
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:59.000]  if he'd had two bottles of whiskey do you understand that i mean are you able to explain that to these
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:04.680]  people in del Rio they let me have an hour and a half in my wardrobe and i addressed that issue
[02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:10.760]  you're just talking about in austin they give you 20 minutes and on the breath test case you can barely
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:16.680]  even explain the machine's fallacies in that much time it's incredible the way that our citizens
[02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:22.600]  are being manipulated their rights are being crushed um i went to a courtroom in san antonio
[02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:28.200]  yesterday and they said oh as soon as this hearing starts everyone must clear the courtroom including
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:33.880]  lawyers because they're exposing a breath test uh technical supervisor down who has been fudging
[02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:39.880]  the data and getting people convicted wrongfully and i i told the bailiff i said if the judge comes
[02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:44.840]  out here and orders me out of the courtroom i guess i'm going to jail because i will be held
[02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:49.400]  exactly that's totally criminal but but but here's what's amazing we've got to get you in studio for
[02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:56.440]  like two hours because this this isn't just about dwis it it ties into literally everything it ties
[02:52:56.440 --> 02:53:04.280]  into every other place they're running over things but they systematically know what they're doing
[02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:09.720]  just shredding the bill of rights shredding the constitution not wanting people to have access
[02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:16.440]  to juries started with the war on drugs in a great uh way and they have been just hammering
[02:53:16.440 --> 02:53:24.360]  a sense to think that we could take 60 of the drug cartels money away overnight we could get
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:30.200]  a regulation of marijuana which marijuana can be found and bought anywhere in this country
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:38.120]  we can regulate it we can just like alcohol 21 and over we can tax it we can pour some of that
[02:53:38.120 --> 02:53:44.520]  money into rehab in case someone believes they have an addictive problem with marijuana instead
[02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:52.280]  we use it to to keep a a stranglehold on youth and to terrify people alex whether you agree with
[02:53:52.280 --> 02:53:59.480]  the use of marijuana or not people who don't use it but think it ought to be legalized are terrified
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:05.320]  to say that they'll be fired they'll be harassed uh they'll think they'll be put on the government
[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:12.840]  list it's it's really uh it's really terrifying the way that our government is abusing us and if
[02:54:12.840 --> 02:54:18.360]  someone would have i'd love to tell the democrats barack obama is set back the municipal marijuana
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:25.800]  program 20 years george bush was better for municipal marijuana which is saving lives and
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:34.200]  killing cancer and and barack obama is closing down the distribution points and throwing people
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:41.640]  in prison well said again go through we've only got a few minutes left here okay go through jamie
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:47.880]  what the dwidude.com covers what just the basics of what people should do or what you would do
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:52.760]  is i know each case is different but but hypothetically if you had three beers you don't
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:57.320]  even have what they call a buzz you're driving home you know some teenagers texting almost
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:04.200]  killing 20 people that's no big deal you're driving home uh eight o'clock at night lights go on uh and
[02:55:04.200 --> 02:55:09.880]  they're just out there randomly pulling people over coming out of a bar no due process no uh no
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:15.000]  excuse no reason no probable cause what do you do when the officer walks over i mean my big thing
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:20.280]  is just give them the license and stuff and don't answer questions what do you do he it's not his
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:24.920]  business where i've been it's not his business what i've been doing it's not his business where i'm
[02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:32.120]  going i don't have to answer those questions i provide my valid insurance my valid driver's license
[02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:36.120]  and then i'm gonna roll the window back up if he wants to talk i'll crack it a half an inch
[02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:41.720]  i don't drink out could you imagine if they caught me with one beer on my breath
[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:47.400]  they'd have the news team down at the jail when i got there um but you know you don't want to be
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:53.880]  ugly you don't want to use profanity hopefully you're being videotaped so everything is happening
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:56:00.600]  will be shown to such a jury so be in your best behavior but they're going to ask you to get out
[02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:07.160]  of the car if they smell any alcohol it's it's such a joke about red eyes in austin texas or
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:13.640]  anywhere that i practice all of my jurors have red eyes the one or two that don't use visine this
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:18.920]  morning probably because they smoke some weed but i was about to say i get red eyes from allergies
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:25.240]  and stuff it did during allergy season every everyone just i don't get red eyes when i drink
[02:56:25.240 --> 02:56:29.400]  by the way i don't even know what this red eye thing me and that sounds pretty stupid probably
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:35.800]  it's from fatigue or being a smoky bar and there aren't any smoky bars anymore so um i think it's
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:41.720]  just for me know you've been up so many hours your eyes get tired um they are trained to ask you
[02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:47.240]  questions that will divide your attention they'll say can i see your license please now while you're
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:51.720]  reaching for your driver's license they go where are you coming from now my daddy taught me to
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:57.000]  respect the police and answer their questions in a polite manner so i stop what i'm doing with my
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:02.040]  driver's license and i look up and i start answering his question his police report will say
[02:57:02.680 --> 02:57:06.840]  subject couldn't concentrate on answering my question and getting driver's license at the
[02:57:06.840 --> 02:57:13.320]  same time he had to stop what he was doing physically in order to try to respond through
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:20.120]  his befuddled and intoxicated mind that's what we're seeing in these reports um i i drive a corvette
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:25.720]  when he got out of the vehicle he had to use the door to get up while i weight 240 pounds and
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:29.800]  i'm 55 years old i ought to have a rope to crawl up out of to get out of that corvette
[02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:38.120]  thing that they see the red eyes is not allergies it's intoxication um the odor of alcohol in your
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:42.520]  breath have you been drinking out yeah i had a glass of wine with some spaghetti over at uh
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:47.800]  carabas it was terrific oh he admitted that he was drinking and i can smell the odor of
[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:52.200]  an alcohol beverage now i want to give him the portable breath test to see whether or not he
[02:57:52.200 --> 02:57:59.480]  has alcohol in his breath well i told you i did i drank you smelled it why do you need the uh
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:04.440]  the little breath device the one that can't introduce for a number in court but i'll tell
[02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:08.600]  you what that's another thing you want to tell the truth and go yeah i was a cookout i had two

[02:58:21.240 --> 02:58:27.800]  their receptors in our brain that show we were designed to drink alcohol your brain has receptors

[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:09.960]  ross the police officer uh jamie yes uh just in the four minutes we have left this little
[03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:14.760]  addendum what else would you want to tell people about when you get pulled over all right so knowing
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:19.960]  that they're going to look at anything you do and try to uh bring it into the courtroom or into the
[03:01:19.960 --> 03:01:25.560]  probable cause after david to get your blood uh as criminal activity or evidence of intoxication
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:31.960]  they'll say that your speech is slurred so don't say much unless you know your speech is not slurred
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:37.880]  and there's a video it's all right to talk a little bit uh just so later we can come to court
[03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:43.320]  and show that your speech was not slurred do not take the field sobriety test when they do this
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:52.840]  the hgn here goes nothing test it is absolute junk science do not let them have that if they do hgn
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:57.960]  and they find four more clues you're going to jail no matter what else you do don't take the walk
[03:01:57.960 --> 03:02:02.440]  and turn test they don't tell you what will make you fail they don't tell you what they're looking
[03:02:02.440 --> 03:02:07.720]  for so you don't even know that you're screwing up don't take the one leg stand even on a no
[03:02:07.720 --> 03:02:14.520]  refusal weekend or if it's 24 seven that does not mean you cannot refuse the field sobriety test
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:20.600]  it does and also you can still refuse the breath test they'll just take your license away unless
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:26.200]  we can win it back at a hearing if we have the hearing at dps we get the officers under oath
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:30.600]  and we get to paint them into a corner so they don't come into court later and start making
[03:02:30.600 --> 03:02:36.680]  up evidence so don't take the breath test unless you know you are going to pass i tell people
[03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:40.760]  this all the time if you go out drinking you're leaving a bar leaving a restaurant or leaving
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:46.920]  a friend's house whatever anticipate the police are going to stop you and do a dwa investigation
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:52.200]  if you still want to drive go for it just save my number to your cell phones you can call me
[03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:58.280]  from the pokey because probably where you're going if they get it if they ask you look if you
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:03.160]  don't take the breath test we're going to get a blood warrant so why don't you consent do not consent
[03:03:03.160 --> 03:03:10.040]  that's not voluntary consent say no you could waive your rights you know so so don't waive your right
[03:03:10.040 --> 03:03:15.000]  well that's right this this blood draw is a physical assault and if you can prove that
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:19.800]  they didn't get probable cause that the warrants a fraud i think people should just sue them if
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:26.360]  they have the money just to punish them with time and energy i mean there are ways to beat them aren't
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:31.960]  there the the ways to beat the blood draw is they're doing the blood draws incorrectly they're not
[03:03:31.960 --> 03:03:38.520]  they're i i would have to go to this for probably 30 minutes with the alex i went to axion labs up
[03:03:38.520 --> 03:03:45.320]  in chicago it's a number one lab in america on the gas chromatography and the mass spectometry
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:50.920]  and the issues of blood draws i can change one little number on the keyboard and double your
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:56.520]  alcohol reading um if they don't and by the way if they'll violate the bill of rights constitution
[03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:01.560]  lie on the stand set you up well i mean how many police labs have been caught defrauding people
[03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:06.760]  with the evidence labs at an industrial level the fbi crime lab the dalis crime lab the houston
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:13.480]  crime lab all every major city's been caught uh the dps crime lab in austin won't release to us
[03:04:13.480 --> 03:04:19.080]  the blood discovery we request they fight us tooth and nail if what you're doing is true
[03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:25.000]  and correct and honest you'd show it to anybody if i was running the books for a non-profit
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:30.040]  organization and you came to me and said we want to look at the books jamie and i said no and i
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:36.840]  fought you in court there's only one reason i'm cheating i'm a liar yeah i've actually sent people
[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:42.200]  to prison for violations of uh non-profits they had to access tv and that's what happened they
[03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:48.120]  fought us we knew something was there and uh we got them all right well i'm very impressed uh jamie
