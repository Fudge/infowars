[00:00:04.978 --> 00:00:06.820]  We are on the march.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.003]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:16.909]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.130]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.835]  I'm David Knight, your host today on this Sunday, October the 26th, 2014.
[00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:26.638]  We have an amazing conspiracy theory for you.
[00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:28.900]  And this one doesn't come from the Internet.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.103]  This one actually comes from AT&T and FEMA.
[00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:39.185]  We reported on Friday that the White House emergency alert system had interrupted TV viewers across America.
[00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:42.026]  Austin, across North Carolina, many other places.
[00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:49.568]  They got a message on their screen telling them not to use their phones and mentioning something about Ebola.
[00:00:49.568 --> 00:00:52.068]  And evidently they lost their service for quite some time.
[00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:58.450]  Now, AT&T has put up on Facebook, this is an update to the story, has put up on Facebook that
[00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.433]  Earlier today, an emergency message was carried on our networks as well as some other providers.
[00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:05.774]  And then, here's what they say.
[00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:17.081]  A FEMA investigation indicates that a nationally syndicated radio show, not affiliated with AT&T, accidentally sent a message over the National Emergency Alert System.
[00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:20.640]  Now that raises a lot of questions.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.420]  Each one of those clauses there.
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.543]  First of all, how could a radio show that is not affiliated with AT&T take over their system and accidentally put out a message?
[00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:34.464]  As one person said, for close to two hours they took this over?
[00:01:34.464 --> 00:01:36.565]  They're not even affiliated with you and they took it over?
[00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:41.186]  I don't know if they're referring to us, because we're the ones who broke the story.
[00:01:41.186 --> 00:01:43.447]  It was Paul Joseph Watson's story on Friday.
[00:01:44.227 --> 00:01:50.874]  Basically showing pictures of what people had put up, had happened to their television sets.
[00:01:50.874 --> 00:02:01.846]  This is absolutely amazing that this would be AT&T saying that FEMA told them that a radio show accidentally put this message out over their U-verse system.
[00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:05.931]  That's a pretty amazing revelation, but we've got something
[00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:09.013]  Just as amazing, from Hillary Clinton.
[00:02:09.013 --> 00:02:10.154]  Listen to this soundbite.
[00:02:10.154 --> 00:02:11.516]  This came out over this last weekend.
[00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:14.458]  Listen to what Hillary says about where jobs come from.
[00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:25.248]  Don't let anybody tell you that, you know, it's corporations and businesses that create jobs.
[00:02:25.248 --> 00:02:28.531]  You know, that old theory, trickle down economics.
[00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.227]  Yeah, right.
[00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:36.808]  Yeah, we know that jobs don't come from businesses.
[00:02:36.808 --> 00:02:40.890]  It's not people working really hard, saving their money, starting a small business.
[00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.990]  They don't create jobs.
[00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.871]  No, it's first ladies that create jobs.
[00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:47.693]  It's governors, it's presidents who create jobs.
[00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:50.014]  That is one of my pet peeves when I watch these debates.
[00:02:50.814 --> 00:02:59.736]  Even Republicans, I shouldn't say even Republicans, but especially Republicans like to brag about how many jobs they created as governor when they're running for president.
[00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:02.117]  At that point, I'm throwing stuff at the television set.
[00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:05.477]  If you understand the way the world works, you are too.
[00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:11.319]  This is Hillary Clinton's moment where she's imitating Obama saying, you didn't build that.
[00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.539]  Look.
[00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:14.980]  Everybody knows that it's businesses that create jobs.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.440]  That's not their intention.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.741]  But it's what they have to do if they're going to grow their business.
[00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.402]  One person can't do it all.
[00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:22.922]  They're going to have to hire people.
[00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:31.885]  That's one of the reasons why small businesses, innovative businesses, create more jobs than the crony capitalist that Hillary Clinton hangs out with.
[00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:37.127]  How many jobs does Hillary Clinton create when she speaks for a quarter of a million dollars at a university?
[00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:40.831]  She's got some assistance, maybe a hairstylist.
[00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:42.714]  I don't know, looking there, maybe she doesn't have a hairstylist.
[00:03:42.714 --> 00:03:45.518]  But, you know, how many jobs does she create?
[00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:48.102]  Are they jobs that we want created?
[00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:53.369]  You know, we have a situation right now where the federal government is creating so many jobs.
[00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.373]  And places that we don't want them like IRS agents to enforce Obamacare.
[00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:02.416]  We should be very concerned about that because that's shutting the economy down.
[00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:04.217]  They're not providing people a service.
[00:04:04.217 --> 00:04:09.741]  They're not offering them a sandwich or a hot dog or some other service or product.
[00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:12.142]  No, they're shutting things down.
[00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:17.166]  And that has a direct application to whether or not you will be able to start a business someday.
[00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:20.168]  It has a direct application as to whether or not you will have a job.
[00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:22.065]  But they're going to shut that down.
[00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:32.833]  We're also going to be talking about how the IRS is moving now, accelerating, confiscating money from businesses because of the way and the timing in which they make their deposits.
[00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:39.637]  They call it structuring and they confiscate that money from small businesses without even charging them with a crime.
[00:04:39.637 --> 00:04:41.939]  It's a major story breaking on the New York Times.
[00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.420]  It's been around for a very long time.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.242]  It's good that mainstream media is finally picking this up.
[00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:47.143]  Better late than never.
[00:04:47.543 --> 00:04:52.573]  We're going to be back with that and some breaking admissions from congressional testimony about Ebola.
[00:04:52.573 --> 00:04:53.515]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:00.322 --> 00:05:01.643]  The experts are clear.
[00:05:01.643 --> 00:05:08.748]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:05:08.748 --> 00:05:15.032]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:05:15.032 --> 00:05:18.615]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:22.958]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:28.281]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:29.301]  Not our iodine.
[00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:35.645]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:05:50.354 --> 00:05:50.755]  I'm sick.
[00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:51.715]  Just let me sick.
[00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:56.419]  I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:57.420]  It's Chancellor Sattler.
[00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:22.767]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:25.932]  Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen,
[00:06:28.727 --> 00:06:33.548]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:34.589]  You designed it, sir.
[00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:35.529]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.169]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:39.290]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.070]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:50.733]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and surveilling your submission.
[00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:50.953]  Cameras.
[00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:51.933]  We need cameras.
[00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.354]  How did this happen?
[00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:54.134]  Who's to blame?
[00:06:55.427 --> 00:06:57.770]  Certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.693]  They will be held accountable.
[00:06:59.693 --> 00:07:05.562]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:08.464]  I know why you did it.
[00:07:08.464 --> 00:07:10.265]  I know you were afraid.
[00:07:10.265 --> 00:07:11.505]  Who would it be?
[00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:12.265]  War?
[00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:12.885]  Terror?
[00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:14.185]  Disease?
[00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:20.647]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:07:20.647 --> 00:07:27.028]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:33.149]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.591]  There is a war.
[00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:43.472]  It's happening now.
[00:07:43.472 --> 00:07:45.833]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:48.414]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:07:48.414 --> 00:07:50.315]  We are the resistance.
[00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:52.076]  We are the Infowar.
[00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:56.398]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:58.659]  I'm David Knight on this Sunday, October 26, 2014.
[00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:19.424]  Now, if you were looking at Infowars.com on Friday and listening to our show, you heard us break the news that the White House Emergency Alert System had interrupted TV viewers across America with a message that came up and said, don't use your phone, and some information about the Ebola outbreak.
[00:08:19.424 --> 00:08:20.564]  Now there's been an update to this.
[00:08:21.983 --> 00:08:41.372]  AT&T, which was running the stations that this occurred on, said that they were told, they put this up on their Facebook account, they were told that a FEMA investigation indicated that a nationally syndicated radio show, not affiliated with AT&T, accidentally sent a message over the National Emergency Alert System.
[00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:45.626]  Now that raises a lot of amazing questions.
[00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:53.411]  First of all, how could a nationally syndicated radio show, maybe they're talking about us, I don't know, they don't name any names.
[00:08:53.411 --> 00:08:54.691]  We were the ones who broke the story.
[00:08:54.691 --> 00:09:03.777]  How could a radio show, even if it is nationally syndicated, if it's not affiliated with AT&T, how could it broadcast over their network?
[00:09:04.574 --> 00:09:06.776]  How could it do that accidentally?
[00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:12.703]  How could it take their system down, as some of these comments are saying on Facebook, for two hours?
[00:09:12.703 --> 00:09:14.525]  How could that happen?
[00:09:14.525 --> 00:09:17.388]  Let's go back to that report that was filed on Friday.
[00:09:17.388 --> 00:09:19.751]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson breaking that down for you.
[00:09:32.293 --> 00:09:49.959]  Americans watching television were puzzled earlier today when their programs were interrupted by an emergency alert message from the White House telling them that their channels would automatically be changed for an emergency alert and that they were not to use their phones in order to keep lines open.
[00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:57.962]  This is the message that viewers in Austin, Atlanta, North Carolina and numerous other areas of the country saw earlier today.
[00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:12.144]  You said Captain was looking for me.
[00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:15.251]  I said I'd take care of it, so why don't we stay out of each other's jobs?
[00:10:26.622 --> 00:10:37.650]  And these are clips, for those of you listening on radio, these are clips of television programs where you can see that they're putting the banner across there about the emergency broadcast system, which is only available to the White House.
[00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.952]  Then we had other people on Twitter reporting the same thing.
[00:10:40.952 --> 00:10:44.135]  Brian Jacuto, who's in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:51.205]  Got the same emergency broadcast, but again, in each case, no alert message followed.
[00:10:51.205 --> 00:11:00.518]  It was seemingly a test run, forcing the TV channels to tune in to the local news station for a White House alert, which never came.
[00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:19.390]  Shortly after the alert, WSOC-TV, which is based out of Charlotte, North Carolina, put out an alert, a message on their website, saying it was looking into the emergency alert that aired at around 8.30am on Friday morning, after hearing that radio stations and television stations broadcast the message.
[00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:25.413]  So, the local news channels that broadcast the message aren't even aware that it was planned.
[00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:30.656]  So, if this was a test, then it wasn't communicated to any of the radio or television stations,
[00:11:31.036 --> 00:11:33.737]  In advance by the federal government.
[00:11:33.737 --> 00:11:46.162]  So AT&T put out a statement to U-verse customers, it seems that this was restricted to U-verse customers, saying that earlier today U-verse TV customers may have received an emergency alert notification.
[00:11:46.162 --> 00:11:50.923]  We confirm that there is no emergency at this time and we are investigating why this occurred.
[00:11:50.923 --> 00:11:53.144]  We apologize for any convenience.
[00:11:53.144 --> 00:11:55.365]  So the Atlanta Journal-Constitution called it
[00:11:56.005 --> 00:12:00.767]  Alarming, but erroneous, that viewers received this message.
[00:12:00.767 --> 00:12:22.518]  So they're claiming that it was a mistake, that this was broadcast, the AT&T and U-verse spokespeople, and yet we know for a fact that the White House Emergency Alert System is completely outside of the control of radio and television stations, so when they want to broadcast that emergency signal, be it real or a test,
[00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:25.117]  It's automatic.
[00:12:25.117 --> 00:12:35.861]  The radio, the television station has no choice to interrupt or to dismiss or to opt out of the signal if it's directly from the White House by law.
[00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:43.725]  Stations are required by federal law to relay EAN, Emergency Action Notification, messages immediately.
[00:12:43.725 --> 00:12:53.069]  So the encoders and decoders are actually installed directly within the broadcast systems of the television and radio stations who have no control
[00:12:54.144 --> 00:12:56.785]  No power to interrupt these messages.
[00:12:56.785 --> 00:13:00.646]  They come directly from the federal government.
[00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:20.714]  And what's concerning is the fact that these emergency messages we reported back in 2011 in the case of the PlanAlert program, which is the same system but for mobile phones, for cell phones, in New Jersey, caused panic when authorities in the state sent out an emergency alert via Verizon
[00:13:21.624 --> 00:13:29.250]  Which warned residents that there was a civil emergency in progress and advising them to quote, take shelter.
[00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:38.117]  So then panicked citizens flooded 911 lines with anxious calls because of this test which wasn't supposed to go out.
[00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:45.983]  So now we have another example of a test going out amidst a national concern about the Ebola outbreak
[00:13:46.744 --> 00:14:01.613]  The White House is sending out emergency alert messages, quote, by mistake, telling people not to use their phone lines and advising them to wait for an emergency broadcast directly from the government, which never came.
[00:14:01.613 --> 00:14:09.017]  And so, as you can imagine, this has caused huge consternation on conspiracy websites and
[00:14:10.063 --> 00:14:29.628]  You know, I'm not one for believing, embracing every conspiracy, but I think with just cause that people are concerned about this, especially given Obama's remarks a couple of days ago when he said that Ebola is a trial run for a deadlier airborne disease, and that this Ebola situation was allowing the federal government to prepare.
[00:14:30.268 --> 00:14:50.814]  So now, two days after those comments, we have this bizarre emergency message from the White House being sent out to people across the country, urging them not to use their telephone lines and to stand by for an emergency message from the White House amidst this national Ebola situation, a message which never came.
[00:14:50.814 --> 00:14:58.636]  So is the emergency alert message that went out today part of another trial run to see how Americans would respond?
[00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.809]  I don't know.
[00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:13.312]  It's definitely disconcerting that they would commit this mistake, this mistake test run of the emergency alert system amidst the general concern about the Ebola outbreak.
[00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:16.733]  Let me know in the comments below if you saw this emergency alert message.
[00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:17.393]  So there you have it.
[00:15:17.393 --> 00:15:22.014]  Here's the emergency alert system that is under the direct control of the White House.
[00:15:22.014 --> 00:15:26.755]  As Fox News pointed out, it can only be activated by the President in times of emergency.
[00:15:27.435 --> 00:15:38.745]  They put this out and then when people get upset about the false alarm, they blame it on a nationally syndicated radio show that they say is not affiliated with AT&T.
[00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:41.848]  The ones that it went out over, their network that it went out over.
[00:15:41.848 --> 00:15:44.871]  I guess they're referring to us because we're the ones who broke that.
[00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:49.693]  That's one of the most amazing conspiracy theories you'll ever hear, and it comes from FEMA.
[00:15:49.693 --> 00:15:52.374]  Stick with us, you're going to hear an amazing lie from Hillary Clinton.
[00:15:52.374 --> 00:15:54.354]  Businesses don't create jobs.
[00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:58.396]  She's doubling down on Obama's lies about you didn't build that.
[00:15:58.396 --> 00:15:59.256]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:16:01.391 --> 00:16:11.957]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:16:11.957 --> 00:16:18.420]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:16:31.167 --> 00:16:34.829]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:39.112]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:16:39.112 --> 00:16:40.893]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:16:40.893 --> 00:16:48.738]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.

[00:17:00.851 --> 00:17:02.792]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:07.315]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:17:07.315 --> 00:17:11.778]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:19.102]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:17:19.102 --> 00:17:28.168]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:17:28.388 --> 00:17:33.931]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.

[00:18:00.769 --> 00:18:10.415]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:20.340]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.262]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:18:23.482 --> 00:18:24.103]  I think so.
[00:18:46.186 --> 00:18:52.448]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:19:07.051 --> 00:19:09.614]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:19:09.614 --> 00:19:16.662]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:19:16.662 --> 00:19:19.645]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:19:19.645 --> 00:19:22.608]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:19:22.608 --> 00:19:24.631]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.414]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:33.256]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:36.778]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:39.859]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:20:03.888 --> 00:20:10.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.330]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.831]  I'm David Knight.
[00:20:13.831 --> 00:20:15.511]  On this Sunday, October 26, 2014.
[00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:30.551]  And we were just talking just before this break about this White House emergency alert system that went out.
[00:20:30.551 --> 00:20:32.773]  And of course, it put out this weird message.
[00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.234]  Everybody was saying, you know, what's this about?
[00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.496]  It's telling us not to use our cell phones.
[00:20:36.496 --> 00:20:39.998]  It's warning people, you know, stay off the phone.
[00:20:39.998 --> 00:20:43.441]  It went out over the AT&T U-Verse connections.
[00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:45.663]  Evidently, it was their customers that it was focused on.
[00:20:46.523 --> 00:21:03.456]  And AT&T then responded to this report, to this article that Paul Joseph Watson had on Friday, blaming a quote, nationally syndicated radio station for sending the alert message, despite the fact that only the federal government, actually only the White House, sends out these emergency alerts.
[00:21:03.456 --> 00:21:06.298]  This is something that's under control of the President.
[00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:12.502]  And so it raises a lot of questions, but here's where this is going to play out in the broader scheme of things.
[00:21:13.303 --> 00:21:20.272]  It's not just an emergency alert that can scare people when they put it out without any reason like they just did.
[00:21:20.272 --> 00:21:22.114]  And it actually went out for a couple of hours.
[00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:28.322]  The questions remain, how could a radio show that's not affiliated with AT&T, as they said, put this out?
[00:21:28.322 --> 00:21:31.005]  Of course, that was what FEMA told them to tell the public.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.182]  But it's really not just the communications that they want to control for people.
[00:21:36.182 --> 00:21:42.145]  Telling them don't use your phones, even being able to shut down broadcast television at the same time.
[00:21:42.145 --> 00:21:45.006]  This is also about driverless cars.
[00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:53.892]  This is about controlling not only your communications, but you're going to eventually have your transportation, your movement, controlled very much as well.
[00:21:53.892 --> 00:21:58.695]  Understand that driverless cars are not self-driving cars, as I like to tell everybody.
[00:21:58.695 --> 00:22:01.497]  Right now, a self-driving car is essentially what you've got.
[00:22:01.497 --> 00:22:03.298]  You're driving the car yourself.
[00:22:03.298 --> 00:22:15.447]  What you're going to have is a computer-driven car under control of the government or the large corporations that work with the government, that the government works for, where you can't tell where one ends and the other begins, like Uber.
[00:22:17.145 --> 00:22:26.669]  The CEO of Uber has said what makes his service and other taxi services expensive is that other dude in the car with you when you're driving around.
[00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:36.012]  He said, once we get rid of that other dude in the car, in other words, we're just going to have a computer-controlled car, once we get rid of that other dude, you're going to find that it's very cheap.
[00:22:36.012 --> 00:22:42.635]  As a matter of fact, it's going to be so cheap that you're not going to want to have individual car ownership.
[00:22:43.834 --> 00:22:47.896]  We're going to go down the same path, and I think it's only about five to six years.
[00:22:47.896 --> 00:22:51.057]  They're accelerating this very, very rapidly.
[00:22:51.057 --> 00:23:07.844]  If you look, it was just back in March and April that they were talking about how the legal framework was being adjusted at that time, and the European Union, also in the United States, allowing them to legally run self-driving autonomous cars on the streets in Europe and in America.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.921]  The technology is not the obstacle.
[00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:15.282]  It's really the legal issues and customer acceptance.
[00:23:15.282 --> 00:23:18.202]  I think a lot of people don't like to drive.
[00:23:18.202 --> 00:23:19.062]  They want to just sit there.
[00:23:19.062 --> 00:23:24.804]  They would just love to sit there and play with Facebook and Twitter as they're being transported from place to place.
[00:23:24.804 --> 00:23:28.885]  They don't understand the issues of autonomy and liberty.
[00:23:29.665 --> 00:23:33.728]  And they don't understand how this is going to put them under the control of the government.
[00:23:33.728 --> 00:23:38.771]  Understand that the very interstate system was originally started by the military.
[00:23:38.771 --> 00:23:43.434]  It was Eisenhower who took a trip up in the Northeast and he was going from one place to the other.
[00:23:43.434 --> 00:23:52.680]  He wrote a book on his experience, how difficult it was to move this military convoy from one part of the country to the other on the current road system.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.584]  Then during World War II, he saw the autobahn that Hitler had created and said, we've got to have that.
[00:23:58.024 --> 00:24:02.931]  Their first primary concern was to move the military around.
[00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:12.925]  But they also, today, want to control not only what opinions are being formed on the internet, they not only want to control the information that you receive with these emergency alerts,
[00:24:13.365 --> 00:24:16.006]  But they also want to be able to control your movement.
[00:24:16.006 --> 00:24:19.287]  This is going to be the perfect way that they'll be able to do it.
[00:24:19.287 --> 00:24:22.528]  And it's going to go down the same way that smartphones did.
[00:24:22.528 --> 00:24:30.510]  Remember the files that were released from the NSA talking as part of the Snowden releases?
[00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.551]  And it showed a couple of presentations.
[00:24:33.551 --> 00:24:34.211]  One of them said,
[00:24:35.216 --> 00:24:42.622]  Who would have thought in 1984, and they showed the picture, the famous, iconic 1984 commercial from Apple about the iPhone.
[00:24:42.622 --> 00:24:47.447]  They said, who would have thought in 1984, show a picture of that, that this would become Big Brother.
[00:24:47.447 --> 00:24:48.527]  That's the next slide.
[00:24:48.527 --> 00:24:51.970]  And they show Steve Jobs holding up an iPhone.
[00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:54.953]  So they say the iPhone would become Big Brother.
[00:24:54.953 --> 00:25:04.041]  Then the third slide says, and that they would willingly pay for it, and it shows everybody lined up feverishly to get their new iPhones or their new iPads.
[00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:08.866]  That's the way it's going to happen with self-driving cars, as they like to call it.
[00:25:08.866 --> 00:25:11.768]  People will pay for their own slavery.
[00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:27.479]  They'll put some features, some bells and whistles in it, they'll make life even more passive, even more comfortable for you, and you will give up your freedom to ride in this driverless car that's going to run you everywhere you think that you want to go.
[00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:29.441]  Of course, there will be places that will be off-limit to you.
[00:25:29.441 --> 00:25:37.827]  There'll be times where they can just shut down transportation, or maybe they'll just key something in and say, uh, drive Joe to the nearest FEMA camp.
[00:25:38.573 --> 00:25:40.354]  And there you go, just like in Minority Report.
[00:25:40.354 --> 00:25:40.914]  Remember that?
[00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:45.696]  He gets in the car, locks the doors, says it's going to take him to the police station.
[00:25:45.696 --> 00:25:48.597]  That's the future, if they're allowed to do this type of thing.
[00:25:48.597 --> 00:25:58.701]  When they take over communications, and make this clear, this is something that is, it's not just taking control of the different broadcast frequencies.
[00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:00.501]  We see them moving in the internet range.
[00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:05.443]  We see them also moving to shut down and monitor and adjust content.
[00:26:05.443 --> 00:26:07.624]  We've had the director of the FCC point out
[00:26:08.124 --> 00:26:16.491]  That they wanted to do this survey, that was broken a few months ago, where they wanted to do a survey of print newsrooms, of internet news, as well as broadcast news.
[00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:24.198]  They don't even have the authority to look at content of broadcast stations, let alone these other outlets, but that's where they're moving.
[00:26:24.198 --> 00:26:32.505]  Also, the same FCC commissioner also pointed out that the National Science Foundation put out a multi-million dollar grant in a truthy project
[00:26:33.507 --> 00:26:39.229]  Saying essentially they were going to look at how memes were created, how information was passed on social networks.
[00:26:39.229 --> 00:26:44.830]  They were going to vet that and see what was truthful and what wasn't, how opinions are shaped.
[00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.451]  That's what they're really concerned about.
[00:26:46.451 --> 00:26:47.691]  How opinions are shaped.
[00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:49.172]  They're not concerned about the truth.
[00:26:49.172 --> 00:26:59.215]  That's why we see this phony explanation from AT&T about how a radio show could hijack their emergency alert system that's under control of the president.
[00:26:59.215 --> 00:27:03.076]  Of course, they don't say who that is, but I imagine they're referring to us since we broke that.
[00:27:03.436 --> 00:27:08.979]  Now, we've also got an amazing admission that came out just a couple of days ago over this weekend from Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:08.979 --> 00:27:12.421]  Remember when Obama said, you didn't build that?
[00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:14.422]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:27:14.422 --> 00:27:16.083]  Well, Hillary Clinton said this.
[00:27:16.083 --> 00:27:26.449]  Don't let anybody tell you that, you know, it's corporations and businesses that create jobs.
[00:27:26.449 --> 00:27:29.050]  You know, that old theory, trickle down economics.
[00:27:32.411 --> 00:27:34.176]  That has been tried.
[00:27:34.176 --> 00:27:35.219]  That has failed.
[00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:37.253]  There you go.
[00:27:37.253 --> 00:27:49.417]  See, it's not... If you get a job, you didn't get that job because that was created by somebody who worked hard, who saved their money, who created a company, who saw it growing, and of course, one man can't control a growing company.
[00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:51.037]  He's going to have to hire people.
[00:27:51.037 --> 00:27:57.139]  Businesses, you know, there's an element of truth in what she has to say, that their goal is not to create jobs.
[00:27:57.139 --> 00:28:00.540]  Their goal is to create profits.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.481]  But in order to do that, they have to create jobs.
[00:28:04.392 --> 00:28:07.655]  See, unlike Hillary Clinton, they have to create jobs.
[00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:08.856]  Now, she does create jobs.
[00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:20.265]  You know, the governors and the presidents, when they go to the debates and they brag about how many jobs they create, in most of those cases, they're taking credit for the hard work, the savings of other people.
[00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:22.046]  But in many cases, they do create jobs.
[00:28:22.046 --> 00:28:26.950]  You know, Obama has created 16,000 IRS jobs as part of Obamacare.
[00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:35.882]  Now, he's also driven out of business a lot of independent physicians, driven them into retirement, made it clear to them that they don't want to stay in that business.
[00:28:35.882 --> 00:28:36.763]  That's the fruit of it.
[00:28:36.763 --> 00:28:41.470]  It's not how many jobs you create, but what you're creating the jobs to do.
[00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.010]  And it's not
[00:28:42.631 --> 00:28:43.371]  The experts are clear.
[00:29:02.697 --> 00:29:09.824]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:29:09.824 --> 00:29:16.110]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.693]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:29:19.813 --> 00:29:24.036]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:29:24.036 --> 00:29:29.360]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.

[00:31:01.152 --> 00:31:07.254]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forward situation?
[00:31:07.254 --> 00:31:10.576]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.

[00:31:40.096 --> 00:31:42.178]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:31:42.178 --> 00:31:43.219]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:31:43.579 --> 00:31:52.552]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.TV and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[00:32:30.737 --> 00:32:34.398]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:32:34.398 --> 00:32:38.679]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:32:38.679 --> 00:32:40.459]  Can you put two and two together?

[00:33:03.383 --> 00:33:06.924]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:06.924 --> 00:33:14.586]  We are on the march.
[00:33:14.586 --> 00:33:16.686]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:16.686 --> 00:33:19.267]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:31.997 --> 00:33:33.398]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.398 --> 00:33:44.164]  I'm David Knight, your host today, and we're going to be joined in the next hour with someone who is running for local office, but who is also a small businessman running a gun shop.
[00:33:44.164 --> 00:33:47.266]  And I think it's something that we need to look at carefully.
[00:33:47.266 --> 00:33:56.092]  When we say that most of the time we're looking at national office, we're looking at the president, we're looking at congressional races, or maybe even at governor's races.
[00:33:57.233 --> 00:34:00.255]  They understand that all politics is local.
[00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:03.076]  That's what the people who are successful understand.
[00:34:03.076 --> 00:34:07.398]  But they have us focused almost exclusively on national issues.
[00:34:07.398 --> 00:34:19.304]  And of course those are important, but how are we going to fight it when we have someone like Obama who is opening our borders to crime, to disease, to so many different things, creating wars abroad.
[00:34:19.304 --> 00:34:20.544]  How do we fight that?
[00:34:20.544 --> 00:34:23.366]  Do we fight that by sending congressmen to Washington?
[00:34:23.826 --> 00:34:29.112]  Maybe we fight it by getting people elected at the state and local level who are patriots.
[00:34:29.112 --> 00:34:30.233]  Maybe that's the way we do it.
[00:34:30.233 --> 00:34:33.536]  Maybe, as they say, think globally and act locally.
[00:34:33.536 --> 00:34:37.000]  Maybe we need to think about liberty and act locally.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.061]  Maybe that's what we need to do.
[00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:40.063]  So we're going to talk to someone who's running here.
[00:34:40.063 --> 00:34:41.685]  You're going to find a lot of commonality.
[00:34:42.165 --> 00:34:45.647]  Between what he's doing here and what you can do in your area.
[00:34:45.647 --> 00:34:50.329]  You need to be involved in elections so that you know what's happening at the local level.
[00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:52.711]  It's where the sheriffs are, where the town council are.
[00:34:52.711 --> 00:35:01.315]  That's where you can put some effective checks on this abuse of power in Washington, where it may be so corrupt that you can't get control of it anymore.
[00:35:01.315 --> 00:35:08.319]  You know, it's kind of like in many ways, we've got this contest, Ebola and tyranny is the disease.
[00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:15.824]  Just like Ebola, just like a lot of infectious diseases, sometimes it can be stopped in the early stages fairly easily.
[00:35:15.824 --> 00:35:18.166]  Just with cleaning your hands or something.
[00:35:18.166 --> 00:35:25.172]  But after it gets into you, starts reproducing, reaches a certain critical mass, there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[00:35:25.772 --> 00:35:29.254]  And so there are some things that we can do, and a lot of those are at the local level.
[00:35:29.254 --> 00:35:32.956]  So we're going to talk about that with someone here in Austin who's running for it.
[00:35:32.956 --> 00:35:35.497]  I think you'll see a lot of parallels to your area.
[00:35:35.497 --> 00:35:43.262]  But we were just talking in the last section about Hillary Clinton's new quote that businesses don't create jobs.
[00:35:43.262 --> 00:35:47.224]  You know, we need to get over the idea that businesses are interested in creating jobs.
[00:35:47.224 --> 00:35:52.287]  And as I said, there's a certain element of truth in that, that businesses don't set out to create jobs.
[00:35:52.887 --> 00:36:06.037]  But most of the new job creation comes from small businesses, not from crony capitalists who are the friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton, who are the friends of big GOP politicians in Washington.
[00:36:06.037 --> 00:36:09.340]  It's really local businesses that are creating these jobs.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.382]  They're not focused on creating a headcount.
[00:36:12.382 --> 00:36:18.086]  They're focused on providing a service to their customers, and if that's not their primary focus, they're not going to be successful.
[00:36:18.086 --> 00:36:20.988]  But part of that is going to require them hiring people.
[00:36:20.988 --> 00:36:29.855]  And of course, as I said, it's small business that hires the jobs, and it's small business that really feels the brunt of government regulation.
[00:36:30.495 --> 00:36:39.841]  The people who are the crony capitalists who have bought influence with Bill and Hillary Clinton or with the Bushes, those people escape the regulations that the rest of us live under.
[00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:45.105]  They also escape the scrutiny of the IRS or I would say even the abuse of the IRS.
[00:36:45.105 --> 00:36:50.749]  It's not just institutions like Tea Party groups that are being hit, targeted unfairly by the IRS.
[00:36:50.749 --> 00:36:52.030]  Of course a lot of that goes on.
[00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.832]  The IRS is used to target political enemies.
[00:36:55.552 --> 00:37:03.454]  If you haven't seen it, I would suggest that you go to Alex Jones' YouTube channel and look at the interview that we aired on Friday night on the Nightly News.
[00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:09.696]  We talked to someone about the case of George Hanson, a congressman who wrote a book to harass our people.
[00:37:09.696 --> 00:37:11.256]  It was about IRS abuses.
[00:37:11.256 --> 00:37:16.117]  He also wrote and got passed the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which we still use today.
[00:37:16.117 --> 00:37:21.739]  He also stopped the IRS from taxing the relief money from flood victims in his jurisdiction.
[00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:22.979]  And because of all that,
[00:37:23.499 --> 00:37:26.181]  He was targeted by the IRS.
[00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:28.482]  They used dirty tricks for him before the election.
[00:37:28.482 --> 00:37:32.084]  When that didn't work, they came after him with criminal charges.
[00:37:32.084 --> 00:37:32.725]  That didn't work.
[00:37:32.725 --> 00:37:36.747]  He actually, as part of that audit, he got money back from them.
[00:37:36.747 --> 00:37:45.152]  Eventually, they were able to convict him on some fine details of something that he had already cleared with the House Ethics Committee.
[00:37:45.152 --> 00:37:46.313]  He had gotten their OK with it.
[00:37:46.313 --> 00:37:48.815]  It was very upfront as to what he was doing.
[00:37:48.815 --> 00:37:50.656]  And it was selective persecution.
[00:37:51.156 --> 00:37:53.618]  And I'll say persecution, not prosecution.
[00:37:53.618 --> 00:38:01.343]  Because at the same time, Ed Meese, Ronald Reagan's Attorney General, was given a pass for doing the same sort of thing.
[00:38:01.343 --> 00:38:10.549]  Geraldine Ferraro, the vice presidential running mate of Walter Mondale, who ran against Ronald Reagan in 1984, was given a free pass for doing the exact same sort of thing.
[00:38:10.549 --> 00:38:14.352]  But they came after him in the same way they came after Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:38:14.352 --> 00:38:20.256]  They came after him criminally for what should have been a civil fine if they were going to do anything at all.
[00:38:21.116 --> 00:38:22.899]  Eventually they got a conviction from him.
[00:38:22.899 --> 00:38:26.504]  Even that conviction was overturned after he fought it for 10 years.
[00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.427]  It was overturned in the Supreme Court.
[00:38:28.427 --> 00:38:32.152]  Knowing that was going to happen, they came after him yet again.
[00:38:32.152 --> 00:38:34.956]  Relentless political persecution.
[00:38:34.956 --> 00:38:36.999]  But it's not just political persecution.
[00:38:37.219 --> 00:38:40.481]  They're stealing property from small businessmen.
[00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:42.462]  Listen to this story from the New York Times.
[00:38:42.462 --> 00:38:47.745]  The law lets the IRS seize accounts on suspicion with no crime required.
[00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:55.330]  They start out by saying, for almost 40 years, Carol Henders has dished out Mexican specialties in her modest cash-only restaurant.
[00:38:55.330 --> 00:39:00.513]  For just as long, she deposited the earnings at a small bank branch a block away until last year.
[00:39:00.513 --> 00:39:04.916]  And she got some IRS agents who came and informed her that they had seized her checking account
[00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:05.977]  Almost $33,000.
[00:39:05.977 --> 00:39:14.784]  She would have that kind of money in because, of course, she has a payroll, because she has employees, jobs she created.
[00:39:14.784 --> 00:39:25.333]  They said the money was seized solely because she had deposited less than $10,000 at a time, which they viewed as an attempt to avoid triggering a required government report.
[00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:26.674]  They call that structuring.
[00:39:27.392 --> 00:39:37.176]  Now, if you've got a cash business and you're going to accumulate business, wouldn't you want to deposit the cash as you're getting it in, rather than keeping it under your mattress?
[00:39:37.176 --> 00:39:40.397]  I mean, that's the whole point that you have banks, isn't it?
[00:39:40.397 --> 00:39:46.619]  But I say, using a law that's designed to catch drug traffickers, racketeers and terrorists by tracking their cash, and I would
[00:39:47.139 --> 00:39:51.261]  Different with that, I would say it's not designed to catch them, okay?
[00:39:51.261 --> 00:39:53.402]  That's not who it's being used at.
[00:39:53.402 --> 00:40:03.807]  They didn't design the war on drugs to go after the drug dealers, because as we learned from Gary Webb's investigation and many other times, it's the government that is involved in that, it's the corruption.
[00:40:03.807 --> 00:40:09.390]  They designed it to give them power, to take away our due process, our civil liberties.
[00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.771]  This is just one aspect of it.
[00:40:11.771 --> 00:40:15.873]  The civil asset forfeiture laws that really aren't laws at all, because
[00:40:16.553 --> 00:40:18.934]  They don't charge you with a crime.
[00:40:18.934 --> 00:40:20.914]  They don't give you due process.
[00:40:20.914 --> 00:40:22.694]  They violate the Constitution.
[00:40:22.694 --> 00:40:25.535]  And if they do all of those things, they're not legitimate laws.
[00:40:25.535 --> 00:40:27.215]  But here's some other examples of this.
[00:40:27.215 --> 00:40:32.797]  To show how bad this has gotten and how rapidly it's ramping up, they say the IRS made 639 seizures in 2012, up from 114 in 2005.
[00:40:38.098 --> 00:40:42.321]  Okay, so about five to six times the amount in seven years.
[00:40:42.321 --> 00:40:55.711]  They said the practice has swept up dairy farmers in Maryland, an army sergeant in Virginia saving for his children's college education, and the person that we started this with, Mrs. Henders, who is 67.
[00:40:55.711 --> 00:40:59.234]  It's an amazing thing to see this being done to our citizens.
[00:40:59.234 --> 00:41:03.077]  And of course, as I mentioned, you know, the government really does create a lot of jobs.
[00:41:03.077 --> 00:41:05.539]  We're at the point now where if you total up the people,
[00:41:06.428 --> 00:41:18.359]  Who are dependent on the government and you total up the people who work for the government, the massive expansion that we've seen of government employees under Obama, you're getting to the tipping point of it being more than 50%.
[00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:19.240]  Maybe it is already 50%.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.382]  I don't have the stats in front of me.
[00:41:21.382 --> 00:41:23.124]  I know it's getting very close.
[00:41:23.124 --> 00:41:24.865]  Just with Obamacare alone.
[00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:28.848]  Obama added 16,000 IRS agents.
[00:41:28.848 --> 00:41:35.212]  And as I mentioned in the last segment, many physicians have self-retired or gotten out of the business.
[00:41:35.212 --> 00:41:44.619]  Many people are getting out of producing health care services because of the bureaucracy, the harassment of these employees that they're creating.
[00:41:45.259 --> 00:41:51.445]  I had a friend who was in the military, and I had a business at the time, and when we got together, we were talking about my business.
[00:41:51.445 --> 00:41:58.551]  He didn't ask me the metrics that you would expect, you know, what are your gross sales, what is your profit margin, how many stores do you have, whatever.
[00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:02.015]  He asked me how many people I had working for me.
[00:42:02.015 --> 00:42:03.977]  And I thought that was really kind of a strange question.
[00:42:04.707 --> 00:42:16.311]  And as I thought about it, I thought, people who are working for government, whether it's the military, whether it's civilian, they are looking at how many people they have underneath them as a metric of their success.
[00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:19.452]  Because it's all about how many people you control.
[00:42:19.452 --> 00:42:21.093]  It's about building an empire.
[00:42:21.693 --> 00:42:26.097]  And unfortunately, that mentality flows out to the entire society.
[00:42:26.097 --> 00:42:31.523]  Because ultimately, it doesn't become just about how many people you control in your own little fiefdom.
[00:42:31.523 --> 00:42:34.706]  It becomes about controlling everyone.
[00:42:34.706 --> 00:42:39.290]  That is the purpose of our government now, is to control us in everything we do.
[00:42:40.231 --> 00:42:42.614]  That's why they send out the emergency alert systems.
[00:42:42.614 --> 00:42:45.577]  That's why they want driverless cars.
[00:42:45.577 --> 00:42:52.205]  So that they can control your communications, your transportation, your movement, and shape your opinions.

[00:42:52.806 --> 00:42:53.627]  We're going to be right back.

[00:43:11.097 --> 00:43:21.022]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new Oxy Powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:43:21.022 --> 00:43:23.944]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:43:24.144 --> 00:43:24.745]  I don't know.
[00:43:46.903 --> 00:43:52.048]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.

[00:44:01.456 --> 00:44:07.622]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the waters.
[00:44:07.802 --> 00:44:10.365]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:44:10.365 --> 00:44:17.413]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:44:17.413 --> 00:44:20.416]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:23.420]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.382]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:44:25.382 --> 00:44:28.165]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:44:28.285 --> 00:44:34.009]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:44:34.009 --> 00:44:37.531]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:44:37.531 --> 00:44:40.613]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:44:40.613 --> 00:44:47.937]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[00:44:47.937 --> 00:44:51.159]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[00:44:58.743 --> 00:45:08.226]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:45:08.226 --> 00:45:13.367]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:45:13.367 --> 00:45:22.109]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:24.070]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:45:26.135 --> 00:45:28.425]  I guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:45:40.268 --> 00:45:42.389]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:45:42.389 --> 00:45:44.190]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:47.051]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:45:47.051 --> 00:45:51.112]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:45:56.394 --> 00:45:57.975]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:45:57.975 --> 00:45:58.755]  Got it.
[00:45:58.755 --> 00:45:59.256]  Others don't.
[00:46:00.868 --> 00:46:02.828]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[00:46:02.828 --> 00:46:07.369]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:11.830]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:19.131]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:28.213]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:46:28.433 --> 00:46:33.978]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[00:46:33.978 --> 00:46:41.564]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.

[00:47:03.983 --> 00:47:06.605]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:21.409 --> 00:47:29.591]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:34.193]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[00:47:34.193 --> 00:47:49.357]  We've been talking about the war on business, about Hillary Clinton saying that businesses don't create jobs, about the IRS seizing massive amounts of money from small businesses, claiming that they were structuring their deposits.
[00:47:50.347 --> 00:47:54.565]  Not charging them with a crime, not giving them due process, just seizing the money.
[00:47:55.828 --> 00:48:09.298]  You know, if you've got a small business, if you've got a, especially if it's a cash business, let's say it's your hot dog vendor, are you going to be able to deposit your cash at the end of each day without somebody saying, I think you're structuring your deposits to stay under $10,000?
[00:48:09.298 --> 00:48:13.942]  So we're going to treat you as if you're a drug dealer, a money launderer.
[00:48:13.942 --> 00:48:23.329]  They always use those labels to get their laws passed, and then you wind up seeing it used against ordinary people who are not engaged in any criminal activity.
[00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:29.572]  And taking away the due process that our Constitution guarantees.
[00:48:29.572 --> 00:48:34.794]  It respects our rights as individuals that we have over and above the Constitution.
[00:48:34.794 --> 00:48:36.774]  Rights of self-defense.
[00:48:36.774 --> 00:48:38.675]  Rights of free speech.
[00:48:38.675 --> 00:48:40.075]  Rights of privacy.
[00:48:40.075 --> 00:48:44.577]  And yet they take these things away and ignore the Constitution.
[00:48:45.762 --> 00:48:51.587]  There's no legitimate purpose for the kinds of things that we see being done in the name of the war on drugs.
[00:48:51.587 --> 00:48:53.489]  This has been going on for decades.
[00:48:53.489 --> 00:48:58.373]  Finally we see some items being run by the mainstream media.
[00:48:58.373 --> 00:49:03.838]  Perhaps they're laying the groundwork for drug legalization because maybe they don't need the war on drugs anymore.
[00:49:03.838 --> 00:49:08.382]  Now they've got the war on terror because they can do exactly the same sorts of things.
[00:49:08.382 --> 00:49:11.565]  SWAT teams, militarized police, denial of civil liberties.
[00:49:12.466 --> 00:49:19.227]  Repossessing or taking away your possessions without any due process, without even charging you with a crime.
[00:49:19.227 --> 00:49:22.208]  They can do all of that and more with the War on Terror.
[00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:31.630]  So now we see that the Obama administration is looking at putting someone in a position that is advocating legalizing all drugs.
[00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.770]  Someone who was formerly with the ACLU.
[00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:36.071]  I would like to see drug prohibition end, but
[00:49:36.571 --> 00:50:05.574]  Drug prohibition, just simply ending drug prohibition isn't going to be enough if we allow those abuses of our individual freedoms to stand as we see them being impinged upon at airports and elsewhere, if they roll the TSA out all over the streets, if they continue with these SWAT team raids on people for no reason at all, as we see it's expanded even into areas like the Department of Education, SWAT teaming a family because someone in the family had an unpaid student loan.
[00:50:05.874 --> 00:50:13.557]  If we're going to allow that to happen, it's not going to do us any good to take away the criminal penalties for drugs.
[00:50:13.557 --> 00:50:18.079]  And again, I'm not advocating the use of drugs any more than I advocate the use of alcohol.
[00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:22.680]  We just learned that lesson, hopefully, in some ways, about alcohol prohibition.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.521]  It's the prohibition that is the problem.
[00:50:24.941 --> 00:50:28.524]  But taking away the prohibition isn't going to restore our civil liberties.
[00:50:28.524 --> 00:50:33.109]  We can only do that if we get active at the local and state level.
[00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:35.611]  I think it's perhaps, in my opinion, maybe it's not too late.
[00:50:35.611 --> 00:50:39.455]  In my opinion, I think it is too late to try to do anything much about Washington.
[00:50:41.256 --> 00:50:46.799]  Protection against the kind of criminals that we've seen take over Washington is at the state and federal level.
[00:50:46.799 --> 00:50:50.281]  We're going to have to elect patriots with a backbone.
[00:50:50.281 --> 00:51:06.811]  In the next hour we're going to talk to somebody here locally who is someone like that, who is someone who has started small businesses, who knows that businesses in fact do create jobs, and we need people at the local level who are going to push back against this tyranny at the national level.
[00:51:06.811 --> 00:51:09.052]  We haven't talked about Ebola yet today, so I want to
[00:51:09.392 --> 00:51:11.593]  Change directions and go with that for a moment.
[00:51:11.593 --> 00:51:22.216]  And if you want to call in and talk about Ebola or talk about Hillary's amazing profession that businesses don't create jobs, our number on Sundays is 877-789-2539.
[00:51:22.216 --> 00:51:23.397]  That's 877-789-ALEX if you want to chime in on that.
[00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:38.137]  Now we had some amazing revelations that we reported on at Infowars.com from the testimony and congressional hearings on Friday.
[00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:51.610]  Basically we had a major general and some other individuals from the Obama administration go before Congress and they were asked questions about the troop deployment that is going to be taking place in Liberia.
[00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:56.712]  One of the most intense areas of the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa.
[00:51:56.712 --> 00:52:03.956]  Many of us have questioned from the very beginning why it is necessary to send the 101st Airborne Division into that area.
[00:52:03.956 --> 00:52:18.143]  We've been told that it's to build medical facilities to train people, but of course, as Dr. Francis Boyle pointed out several times on our shows with interviews this last week, the 101st Airborne is not known for being a medical unit.
[00:52:18.991 --> 00:52:42.162]  Dr. Boyle is known for being a bioweapons expert and he's pointed out that we have a lot of research facilities in that area and he's pointed out that under treaties that he wrote back in the 1970s and 80s that were enacted with criminal penalties for doing the kinds of research in many cases that these bioweapons labs are doing in Western Africa.
[00:52:42.162 --> 00:52:45.904]  He said they put them there so they could evade monitoring.
[00:52:46.144 --> 00:52:47.986]  That they would get here in America.
[00:52:47.986 --> 00:52:56.736]  So we see a lot of, we see the CDC involved there, we see the US military involved in these areas where the outbreak was, we see Tulane University involved there.
[00:52:56.736 --> 00:53:05.625]  It was interesting to me to hear NPR do a story Friday night as we learned that another medical person had come down with Ebola.
[00:53:06.246 --> 00:53:09.549]  They talked to someone from Tulane University.
[00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:23.661]  Now, of course, Tulane is where they had the famous Tuskegee syphilis experiments, where they did experiments on people without their informed consent, told them they were being treated for diseases, when in fact they were not giving them any treatment.
[00:53:23.661 --> 00:53:28.826]  They just wanted to use black people as guinea pigs, and they did it for decades there.
[00:53:28.826 --> 00:53:29.927]  That was Tulane University.
[00:53:30.427 --> 00:53:34.210]  Now also at the center of our bioweapons research.
[00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:48.199]  And of course, this guy from Tulane was telling NPR that with proper care, he thought that we could get the number of people who died from 80% down to 20% as long as we made sure they had fluids and that was replaced.
[00:53:48.199 --> 00:53:49.860]  He didn't have any basis for that number.
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.222]  He just gave that as a ballpark figure.
[00:53:53.668 --> 00:53:55.910]  Uh, there's a lot of crazy things that are coming out.
[00:53:55.910 --> 00:54:02.096]  But this, what we had on Friday during the day, the congressional testimony, we had a lot of interesting admissions.
[00:54:02.096 --> 00:54:10.664]  The first one that came out was the DOD admitting that they only have one plane available to transport infected soldiers out of Africa.
[00:54:10.664 --> 00:54:13.326]  Here's that testimony before Congress.
[00:54:13.326 --> 00:54:15.368]  How many patients can that aircraft hold?
[00:54:16.269 --> 00:54:20.937]  Well, the aircraft can hold one at a time and can do four movements a week at this point.
[00:54:20.937 --> 00:54:22.038]  Four movements a week?
[00:54:22.038 --> 00:54:23.961]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:23.961 --> 00:54:24.703]  Is that sufficient?
[00:54:26.598 --> 00:54:32.200]  Given the number of Ebola patients that the United States has had in total at the present time, it is sufficient.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.121]  However... But that's not how these epidemics work.
[00:54:35.121 --> 00:54:35.661]  Right.
[00:54:35.661 --> 00:54:48.726]  And so at this time, the Department of Defense has an urgent unstatement that's being worked through the system with Transcom to put together a isolation pod that can carry multiple persons for C-17 aircraft.
[00:54:48.726 --> 00:54:50.066]  Testing will begin in October.
[00:54:50.066 --> 00:54:50.907]  Or, I'm sorry.
[00:54:52.487 --> 00:54:55.329]  Development will begin in October.
[00:54:55.329 --> 00:54:56.309]  Testing in December.
[00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:57.430]  Let me come back in here.
[00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:06.934]  So what he's saying is that they've got one plane that can transmit one person at a time with symptoms and that plane can make four trips a week.
[00:55:06.934 --> 00:55:12.197]  So they're going to send 5,000 troops into the heart of the Ebola outbreak
[00:55:12.697 --> 00:55:17.201]  And they're going to be able to bring back, at most, four per week.
[00:55:17.201 --> 00:55:20.484]  Now that was Representative McHenry from North Carolina.
[00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:23.387]  He says, so really that's all that you can bring back?
[00:55:23.387 --> 00:55:27.190]  And the Major General says, well if they're symptomatic, yeah.
[00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:30.033]  Then Representative McHenry says, so this is not at all sufficient.
[00:55:30.033 --> 00:55:33.276]  And then the Major General says, well we don't know if it's sufficient.
[00:55:33.616 --> 00:55:37.282]  And then McHenry says, this is very disconcerting.
[00:55:37.282 --> 00:55:38.605]  Yes, it is very disconcerting.
[00:55:38.605 --> 00:55:45.797]  It's also very disconcerting to see that they're shipped over there with only four hours of training and with only
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.521]  Gloves and a mask that's not a sufficient mask.
[00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:53.642]  That's what we were told at the beginning of the week.
[00:55:53.642 --> 00:56:01.965]  Then they modified their story somewhat and first they said that's all they really need because they're not going to be exposed to anyone when they're over there.
[00:56:01.965 --> 00:56:11.588]  We learned in the testimony on Friday that they're going to be bringing in 500 medical professionals that are working in the West Africa area working with Ebola patients.
[00:56:11.588 --> 00:56:15.429]  They're going to be bringing 500 of them in a week for training.
[00:56:16.149 --> 00:56:21.977]  That's going to be a lot of exposure to people who are on the front lines with Ebola patients.
[00:56:21.977 --> 00:56:28.505]  Now we hear that they are going to issue them Tyvek suits once they get in country.
[00:56:28.505 --> 00:56:33.331]  But we were told that they didn't need those suits because they weren't going to be exposed.
[00:56:33.331 --> 00:56:34.533]  Listen to what came out
[00:56:34.793 --> 00:56:38.116]  So, General, why do we only hold our troops for 10 days before we release them to bring them back to the United States?
[00:56:59.815 --> 00:57:00.115]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:00.115 --> 00:57:01.016]  Thanks for the question.
[00:57:01.016 --> 00:57:10.506]  And I can understand the confusion on this, but let me see if I can make it clear.
[00:57:10.506 --> 00:57:17.973]  To start, the 21-day period for monitoring has to take place outside the infection zone.
[00:57:17.973 --> 00:57:19.595]  For us, that'll be in the United States.
[00:57:20.422 --> 00:57:35.636]  Out of an abundance of caution, prior to departure, in order to reduce their risk, commanders will be allowed to remove their personnel from whatever jobs they were doing for up to 10 days prior to departure from Liberia.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:49.211]  Yeah, what he's saying is, and we'll have that full clip after we come back, he says the entire country is an infection zone for purposes of quarantine.
[00:57:49.211 --> 00:57:50.232]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:57:51.553 --> 00:57:55.215]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:57:55.215 --> 00:57:59.477]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:57:59.477 --> 00:58:01.258]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:58:01.258 --> 00:58:09.122]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[00:58:09.122 --> 00:58:10.263]  But for how long?
[00:58:10.263 --> 00:58:16.906]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:58:16.906 --> 00:58:19.728]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:58:21.232 --> 00:58:31.777]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[00:58:31.777 --> 00:58:38.240]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:59:03.413 --> 00:59:10.498]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:59:11.178 --> 00:59:13.660]  Or because they're not 100% organic.
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:20.265]  Or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at Infowarslife.com.

[00:59:53.915 --> 01:00:02.862]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.862 --> 01:00:09.487]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:09.487 --> 01:00:13.971]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:16.773]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.773 --> 01:00:17.994]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.883]  We were talking in the last segment about the congressional hearings on Friday on Ebola.
[01:00:23.883 --> 01:00:26.484]  They were asking about the deployment of U.S.
[01:00:26.484 --> 01:00:30.926]  troops in order to quote-unquote fight Ebola in Liberia.
[01:00:30.926 --> 01:00:40.491]  We had some interesting admissions come out of this in terms of what they're doing or have not done to look after the health of the soldiers who are going over there.
[01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:45.374]  We learned that they only have one plane that can bring someone back who is symptomatic.
[01:00:45.374 --> 01:00:46.875]  In other words, keep them in isolation.
[01:00:47.495 --> 01:00:53.561]  That plane can only carry one person at a time and can only make four trips per week.
[01:00:53.561 --> 01:00:58.847]  So they can bring a total of four people back per week that are symptomatic from this area.
[01:01:00.387 --> 01:01:01.748]  And that's it.
[01:01:01.748 --> 01:01:04.809]  Out of 5,000 troops that they're sending over there.
[01:01:04.809 --> 01:01:07.210]  And then we learned this from the Major General.
[01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:08.210]  I want to play this full clip.
[01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:12.491]  We didn't have time for it in the last segment just before the top of the hour.
[01:01:12.491 --> 01:01:14.032]  Let's go back to that clip and play this.
[01:01:14.032 --> 01:01:18.974]  He has amazing admission about how they look at Liberia.
[01:01:18.974 --> 01:01:27.277]  So, General, why do we only hold our troops for 10 days before we release them to bring them back to the United States?
[01:01:28.615 --> 01:01:39.318]  Yes sir, thanks for the question, and I can understand the confusion on this, but let me see if I can make it clear.
[01:01:39.318 --> 01:01:46.780]  To start, the 21-day period for monitoring has to take place outside the infection zone.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.380]  For us, that'll be in the United States.
[01:01:49.247 --> 01:02:04.450]  Out of an abundance of caution, prior to departure, in order to reduce their risk, commanders will be allowed to remove their personnel from whatever jobs they were doing for up to 10 days prior to departure from Liberia.
[01:02:05.502 --> 01:02:12.066]  In case, just to limit their exposure and provide an extra layer of protection.
[01:02:12.066 --> 01:02:16.368]  They're struggling to explain why they're only going to keep them for 10 out of the 21 days they need to be isolated.
[01:02:16.368 --> 01:02:22.311]  I'm going to need further explanation of this because I don't understand the 10 days when the science says the 21 days.
[01:02:22.311 --> 01:02:29.315]  But the 21 days takes place, well the 21 day monitoring for US military personnel will take place stateside after they've left.
[01:02:30.215 --> 01:02:37.000]  Uh, in order to ensure that they are Ebola-free, just as was described previously for other health care workers.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:45.545]  Why can't you quarantine in the country of infection, particularly if we're sending over military that could build a quarantine unit?
[01:02:46.614 --> 01:03:00.688]  Ma'am, I'll defer to the doctors, but what our infectious disease personnel tell us, in order to be absolutely certain that everybody is Ebola-free, it has to be outside the infection zone, and for all intents and purposes, the entire country of Liberia is an infection zone.
[01:03:00.688 --> 01:03:01.189]  There we go!
[01:03:01.189 --> 01:03:05.774]  For all intents and purposes, the entire country of Liberia is an infection zone.
[01:03:06.354 --> 01:03:12.238]  Remember when we were told last week that they were only going to give limited protective equipment to the soldiers who were going over there?
[01:03:12.238 --> 01:03:14.160]  They only gave them four hours of training.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:21.925]  They only needed limited protection equipment like gloves and a mask, not a suit, because they were not going to be exposed to Ebola.
[01:03:21.925 --> 01:03:23.547]  Yet, for purposes of quarantine,
[01:03:24.298 --> 01:03:28.941]  They believe that the entire country is an infection zone.
[01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:34.664]  Now, I find it interesting, as the Congress lady there was pointing out, I think it was Maloney from New York, she was a Democrat.
[01:03:34.664 --> 01:03:37.706]  That was both Democrats and Republicans asking these hard questions.
[01:03:37.706 --> 01:03:42.049]  Why, if we're being told by the CDC that it is 21 days, would you only hold them for 10?
[01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:44.851]  And let's understand, too, the science of this.
[01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:48.253]  That doesn't mean that people are 100% safe after 21 days.
[01:03:48.253 --> 01:03:52.876]  It means that there's a 95% chance that you're not going to get it transmitted after that.
[01:03:53.456 --> 01:03:56.657]  If you go all the way up to 42 days and it goes down to 98%.
[01:03:56.657 --> 01:03:57.697]  It's still not 100%.
[01:03:57.697 --> 01:04:01.698]  So let's understand that these are measures of risk.
[01:04:01.698 --> 01:04:02.878]  They're not absolute.
[01:04:02.878 --> 01:04:04.159]  It's safe or it's not safe.
[01:04:04.159 --> 01:04:06.279]  It's not a binary function here.
[01:04:06.279 --> 01:04:09.480]  It is how much of a risk are we willing to live with.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.901]  They're willing to take a 5% chance that this is going to spread, but they're not even doing that.
[01:04:13.901 --> 01:04:15.001]  They're bringing people back.
[01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:16.282]  They're going to bring people back.
[01:04:16.282 --> 01:04:20.222]  Put all these military personnel after quarantining there for 10 days.
[01:04:20.222 --> 01:04:21.663]  They're going to bring them back.
[01:04:22.643 --> 01:04:33.349]  In a small plane together after 10 days, and we've seen that after about 10 to 14 days, that's when people who have been exposed to it typically come down with it.
[01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:44.374]  So that process of not holding them in country for quarantine, but putting them on a plane for 30 some odd hours and shipping them back stateside, that is even more dangerous.
[01:04:44.374 --> 01:04:47.476]  But they were telling us it wasn't a problem because they were going to be isolated.
[01:04:47.476 --> 01:04:51.498]  Yet now we learned that they consider the entire country to be an infection zone.
[01:04:51.578 --> 01:04:59.502]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back with a couple of your calls and with a local candidate who's going to talk about politics being local in your area as well.
[01:04:59.502 --> 01:05:00.283]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:05:00.283 --> 01:05:09.808]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:05:09.808 --> 01:05:19.533]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:05:19.733 --> 01:05:30.100]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:34.763]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:37.005]  Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[01:05:37.205 --> 01:05:39.747]  And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[01:05:39.747 --> 01:05:45.433]  Instead, OxyPowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:05:45.433 --> 01:05:50.778]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:05:50.778 --> 01:05:56.263]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com to get started with OxyPowder.
[01:05:56.263 --> 01:05:56.743]  Or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:06.223 --> 01:06:07.864]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:10.085]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:06:10.085 --> 01:06:11.785]  Mao took the guns.
[01:06:11.785 --> 01:06:15.146]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:06:15.146 --> 01:06:18.107]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:37.273 --> 01:06:42.716]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:06:42.716 --> 01:06:45.718]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:06:59.324 --> 01:07:01.249]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:07:01.249 --> 01:07:05.561]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:11.096]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:11.096 --> 01:07:12.697]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:07:12.697 --> 01:07:19.443]  We were just talking about congressional testimony on Friday, where we saw a major general, as well as some civilians.
[01:07:19.443 --> 01:07:25.608]  There was only one doctor on the panel that could be asked questions by the congressional committee.
[01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:37.258]  We don't seem to be interested in having doctors in charge of this, but they were primarily focused on the risks to the soldiers, what was being done to protect them, and really, what was the mission?
[01:07:38.072 --> 01:07:50.597]  Now what we learned, not too many people have talked about this, we had a story on Friday on Infowars.com that they only have one plane that can take one person that is symptomatic at a time and that plane can make four journeys a week.
[01:07:50.597 --> 01:07:56.980]  So they can get four people, four soldiers out of the 5,000 that they're sending over there back a week, per week.
[01:07:57.819 --> 01:08:00.561]  Now we've been told, don't worry, they're not going to be in contact with anybody.
[01:08:00.561 --> 01:08:10.528]  Yet we also learned that they're going to be bringing in 500 medical workers per week from the African countries there that are on the front lines of the Ebola outbreak.
[01:08:10.528 --> 01:08:13.410]  They're going to be bringing them in to train them.
[01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:22.897]  We also learned, in this last clip that we played in the last section, the Major General said that they are only going to hold the soldiers in quarantine in that country for 10 days.
[01:08:24.119 --> 01:08:27.502]  And the Congress people were amazed at that.
[01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:28.602]  Why not the 21 days?
[01:08:28.602 --> 01:08:31.064]  We keep hearing that you're going to quarantine people for 21 days.
[01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:35.147]  So he says, well, we'll do some quarantine with them back stateside, but...
[01:08:36.058 --> 01:08:43.966]  We can't do the full quarantine in country because for all practical purposes, Liberia, the entire country, is an infection zone.
[01:08:43.966 --> 01:08:44.647]  There you go.
[01:08:44.647 --> 01:08:48.731]  So the entire country is an infection zone, yet they're sending the soldiers over there.
[01:08:48.731 --> 01:08:53.556]  Soldiers who, in many cases, are not specialists in medicine.
[01:08:53.556 --> 01:08:55.758]  We're sending the 101st Airborne Division over there.
[01:08:56.258 --> 01:09:11.605]  As Dr. Francis Boyle, who is an expert on bioterrorism, pointed out, and he also knows a lot about what the CIA and other agencies have been doing with bioweapons, he pointed out, these are not the divisions that we see as medical divisions or building divisions.
[01:09:11.605 --> 01:09:14.707]  There are a lot of elite fighting units that are going over there.
[01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:15.887]  For what purpose?
[01:09:15.887 --> 01:09:17.328]  Well, we know that the Bilderberg Group
[01:09:17.908 --> 01:09:22.470]  In 2013, pointed out that Africa was one of their areas of special interest.
[01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:28.153]  We know that AFRICOM was created back in 2007, fairly recently.
[01:09:28.153 --> 01:09:32.175]  Are they looking to get at natural resources in Africa?
[01:09:32.175 --> 01:09:37.917]  Are they looking to get a pandemic going across the world so they can sell us vaccines?
[01:09:37.917 --> 01:09:44.340]  It's been reported by the WHO, we have this up on InfoWars.com today, that the Ebola cases have now gone past 10,000.
[01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:46.682]  Worldwide.
[01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:49.365]  This is from the WHO, the World Health Organization.
[01:09:49.365 --> 01:09:55.972]  Now to put that in perspective, that is more than four times the number of all the previous Ebola outbreaks.
[01:09:55.972 --> 01:09:57.835]  There's been about 32 of them.
[01:09:57.835 --> 01:10:00.978]  All of them combined, in total, are less than 2,500.
[01:10:00.978 --> 01:10:03.041]  So this is more than four times that already.
[01:10:06.064 --> 01:10:10.445]  We were told at the beginning of the outbreak that it was a different strain of Ebola.
[01:10:10.445 --> 01:10:12.885]  That's something that hasn't been talked about a great deal.
[01:10:12.885 --> 01:10:27.068]  And so, we keep hearing the same pronouncements that this is, we understand the science, we know everything about this, you just need to trust us, we know how this is spread, and yet, this is still accelerating.
[01:10:27.068 --> 01:10:30.049]  It is still, now it has crossed the 10,000 mark.
[01:10:30.049 --> 01:10:31.669]  We have up on Infowars.com
[01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:55.589]  A quote from the Army Times, from Patricia Keim, it says, viruses like Ebola have been of interest to the Pentagon since the late 1970s, mainly because Ebola and its fellow viruses have high mortality rates and its stable nature in aerosol, its stable nature in aerosol, make it attractive as a potential biological weapon.
[01:10:56.394 --> 01:10:58.714]  I want to take a couple of your calls before we go to a guest.
[01:10:58.714 --> 01:11:13.237]  We have a businessman, a gun shop owner, someone who's going to talk to us about how the elites understand that all politics are local, but many of us who are concerned about liberty haven't gotten that message yet.
[01:11:13.237 --> 01:11:16.077]  Michael Cargill is going to be on with us later in the hour.
[01:11:16.077 --> 01:11:17.958]  Before we do, I want to take a few of your phone calls.
[01:11:17.958 --> 01:11:19.918]  Let's go to Mary in Wisconsin.
[01:11:19.918 --> 01:11:22.898]  Mary?
[01:11:22.898 --> 01:11:23.359]  Hello?
[01:11:23.359 --> 01:11:23.999]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:11:26.501 --> 01:11:34.005]  You and Alex Jones are doing a tremendous job with your team at InfoWars getting the truth out about the acquired diseases that are actually created in labs.
[01:11:34.005 --> 01:11:39.689]  But the most important news that you can share, and I know Alex knows this, and I know you know this, is that Yahweh Jesus Christ is in Australia.
[01:11:39.689 --> 01:11:42.490]  Brian Lunder Golightly Marshall.
[01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:47.353]  His last site on YouTube is Sword of Truth 3168, and also on Google.
[01:11:47.353 --> 01:11:54.417]  God is in the world right now in Australia, and we all, as angels incarnate, and angels in the heavenly realm, and the saints,
[01:11:54.861 --> 01:12:00.265]  Great show, and I got my Ebola t-shirt, and I'll be taking a picture if there's still time for the contest.
[01:12:24.099 --> 01:12:27.542]  If not, I'm going to put it on YouTube or Facebook anyhow.
[01:12:27.542 --> 01:12:29.584]  Yeah, I think the submissions have ended.
[01:12:29.584 --> 01:12:31.005]  I'm not sure.
[01:12:31.005 --> 01:12:34.127]  Guys, have the submissions ended for that contest?
[01:12:34.127 --> 01:12:39.191]  I know the winner is going to be announced on Halloween, but they're going to look that up and I'll let you know.
[01:12:39.191 --> 01:12:39.391]  Go ahead.
[01:12:39.391 --> 01:12:41.133]  What did you want to say?
[01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:45.937]  Well, I just want to say that I'm quite worried about the
[01:12:51.653 --> 01:12:57.135]  Yes, that's something else that's come out that it does have the capacity to go airborne.
[01:12:57.135 --> 01:13:12.641]  Another thing that came out during these congressional testimonies that I did not mention was the fact that they begrudgingly got the doctor to admit that yes, Ebola can be spread by someone touching a surface and the virus staying on that surface and someone else touching that surface.
[01:13:12.641 --> 01:13:13.201]  As a matter of fact,
[01:13:13.781 --> 01:13:22.684]  Nancy Wrightball, the second person who came back, remember the first two that came back and went to Emory University was Kent Brantley and Nancy Wrightball.
[01:13:22.684 --> 01:13:25.705]  She said she had no idea how she contracted it.
[01:13:25.705 --> 01:13:28.146]  She said there was no breach of her protective equipment.
[01:13:28.146 --> 01:13:32.227]  The same thing that the doctor who's currently getting treatment in New York said.
[01:13:32.227 --> 01:13:39.050]  She believed, however, that it might have been that a co-worker who she did not have any direct physical contact with, she was sure about that,
[01:13:39.730 --> 01:14:03.571]  came down with Ebola and she thought that she might have touched something that he touched and so that is a very important part of the training that of course the US military I don't know if they're getting time for that or not they're only getting four hours of training before they go over there but the most important thing about your protective equipment is knowing how to take it off without contaminating yourself because you can contaminate yourself with your own
[01:14:04.352 --> 01:14:04.572]  I think?
[01:14:22.273 --> 01:14:25.956]  To have Ebola riding on a bus because they can give it.
[01:14:25.956 --> 01:14:27.698]  Do you understand that?
[01:14:27.698 --> 01:14:33.983]  So you can't get it on a bus according to Frieden, but you know, don't get on a bus because you could give it to somebody else.
[01:14:33.983 --> 01:14:45.173]  Well, they were able on Friday to get an admission from the people there that begrudgingly that yes, in fact, you could transmit it independently.
[01:14:45.173 --> 01:14:47.495]  Let's go to Chris in Indiana.
[01:14:47.495 --> 01:14:47.715]  Chris.
[01:14:50.831 --> 01:14:51.171]  Hi, David.
[01:14:51.171 --> 01:14:53.112]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:14:53.112 --> 01:14:54.153]  What do you want to talk about?
[01:14:54.153 --> 01:14:55.594]  Oh, I'm doing all right.
[01:14:55.594 --> 01:14:56.894]  You know, we're all being trained.
[01:14:56.894 --> 01:15:10.162]  You know, the first was 9-11, then came the body scanners, then the vaccines, then the checkpoints, and then the martial law via the Boston bombing, and now I think it's all come down to the Algalene Dialectic Problem Reaction Solution.
[01:15:10.162 --> 01:15:15.004]  And with this whole Ebola thing, I think it really is coming through that.
[01:15:15.004 --> 01:15:16.465]  I mean, just think about it.
[01:15:16.465 --> 01:15:20.107]  If there is a real outbreak coming after this new victim in New York City,
[01:15:20.774 --> 01:15:25.837]  And who knows, he's going bowling everywhere, restaurants, subways, everything, taxis.
[01:15:25.837 --> 01:15:30.741]  If it really came down to it, it might affect the economy very much so, and then...
[01:15:31.249 --> 01:15:34.090]  And I think that's what they're more concerned about than people getting sick.
[01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:37.071]  They're concerned about the economic fallout.
[01:15:37.071 --> 01:15:39.712]  They're concerned about the political fallout about this.
[01:15:39.712 --> 01:15:49.115]  I think you're going to see, I think a lot of this stuff is being suppressed and of course we had the doctor who called us and talked about how he had been told that people were being disappeared.
[01:15:49.115 --> 01:15:51.076]  We've had that from several different sources.
[01:15:51.076 --> 01:15:54.117]  I think they're trying to keep this under wraps before the election.
[01:15:54.477 --> 01:15:56.019]  And then it's going to be Katie bar the door.
[01:15:56.019 --> 01:16:00.243]  We're going to find out about that, but especially about Obama's open borders policy.
[01:16:00.243 --> 01:16:00.583]  Stay with us.
[01:16:00.583 --> 01:16:01.404]  We'll be right back.

[01:16:13.897 --> 01:16:30.752]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality, or because they're not 100% organic, or because they don't pass all of the strictest toxicology tests there are that we have listed at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:17:07.247 --> 01:17:08.087]  Security alert.
[01:17:08.087 --> 01:17:09.308]  Security alert.
[01:17:09.308 --> 01:17:11.308]  This is Homeland Security.
[01:17:11.308 --> 01:17:12.209]  Analysis.
[01:17:12.209 --> 01:17:14.889]  InfoWars building into the media operation.
[01:17:14.889 --> 01:17:19.891]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[01:17:19.891 --> 01:17:20.932]  Crime Directive.
[01:17:20.932 --> 01:17:22.472]  Discredit Alex Jones.
[01:17:22.472 --> 01:17:25.333]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:28.574]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[01:17:28.574 --> 01:17:30.735]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[01:17:31.075 --> 01:17:32.395]  These people are assaulting us.
[01:17:32.395 --> 01:17:35.216]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:17:35.216 --> 01:17:37.176]  They are never going to stop.
[01:17:37.176 --> 01:17:41.217]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:17:49.159 --> 01:17:51.119]  Destroy Little Planet TV.
[01:17:51.119 --> 01:17:55.720]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.981]  Intellectually, it's begun and you can feel it.
[01:18:00.816 --> 01:18:02.137]  The experts are clear.
[01:18:02.137 --> 01:18:09.262]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[01:18:09.262 --> 01:18:15.526]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:15.526 --> 01:18:19.129]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[01:18:19.249 --> 01:18:23.472]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[01:18:23.472 --> 01:18:28.795]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:18:28.795 --> 01:18:29.796]  Not our iodine.
[01:18:29.796 --> 01:18:36.160]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:19:00.816 --> 01:19:04.478]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:08.759]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:19:08.759 --> 01:19:10.540]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:15.862]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[01:19:15.862 --> 01:19:18.383]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.

[01:19:41.008 --> 01:19:47.471]  Super Male Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:20:18.074 --> 01:20:28.978]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:20:33.167 --> 01:20:35.792]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:40.854 --> 01:20:42.195]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:42.195 --> 01:20:42.796]  I'm David Knight.
[01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:50.342]  On this Sunday, October 26, 2014, I'm joined here in studio with someone who is running for local office.
[01:20:50.342 --> 01:20:55.226]  Now, why would we put that on an international radio show?
[01:20:55.226 --> 01:21:01.431]  Well, because it's important to have a check against unlawful power at every level.
[01:21:01.431 --> 01:21:03.934]  That's the way our government was initially set up.
[01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:17.037]  Our founders not only put restrictions on the central government, but they also put checks within the central government against the different branches, also checks against the central government's power at the state and the local level.
[01:21:17.037 --> 01:21:25.619]  And yet, we are constantly focused by the mainstream media, by the political parties, only on the highest level offices.
[01:21:25.619 --> 01:21:30.661]  We have a lot of power that is not being used at the state and local level.
[01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:34.002]  And as we're looking at this Ebola outbreak, we have to wonder,
[01:21:35.066 --> 01:21:37.387]  What is being hidden before the election?
[01:21:37.387 --> 01:21:44.912]  We know that Democrats are running fast away from Obama, away from Harry Reid, away from Nancy Pelosi.
[01:21:44.912 --> 01:21:58.400]  They don't want to be seen with the people who personify the agenda that is behind the failure of the Obama administration, behind the anti-freedom, anti-prosperity, open borders agenda that they represent.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.300]  They're running from them.
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:01.602]  And yet, it really is the agenda.
[01:22:02.242 --> 01:22:04.163]  Look at Ebola, for example.
[01:22:04.163 --> 01:22:21.973]  As we pointed out last week, we had a brave whistleblower, Dr. James Lorenzi, a physician, call us and tell us about people that he had first-hand knowledge of that had been basically disappeared once they had Ebola.
[01:22:21.973 --> 01:22:29.677]  Also in the hospital system, that was not in the hospital system where he was, but in the hospital system where he was, they were removing protective equipment.
[01:22:29.677 --> 01:22:31.358]  Remember that it wasn't just
[01:22:31.858 --> 01:22:42.287]  That Mr. Duncan, who had Ebola, the Liberian who came to Dallas and had Ebola, it wasn't just that he was sent away from the emergency room for two days that was the biggest outrage.
[01:22:42.287 --> 01:22:49.473]  I think just as outrageous was the fact that when he came back two days later and they realized that he did have Ebola, they quarantined him and separated him.
[01:22:49.473 --> 01:22:53.257]  They didn't give the nursing staff protective equipment.
[01:22:53.257 --> 01:22:54.278]  Why would they do that?
[01:22:54.978 --> 01:22:58.841]  I think perhaps for the same reason that they're now confiscating protective equipment.
[01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:03.324]  They don't want people being seen walking around in hazmat suits.
[01:23:03.324 --> 01:23:04.885]  They don't want to panic people.
[01:23:04.885 --> 01:23:15.472]  We see the essay from the Wall Street Journal, the anti-hysteria hysteria, saying that the only thing they're getting hysterical about is the fact that they don't want people to get afraid of this.
[01:23:15.472 --> 01:23:18.074]  And yet, we need to understand what the risks are.
[01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:20.494]  And there are risks out there.
[01:23:20.494 --> 01:23:22.275]  It's not totally safe.
[01:23:22.275 --> 01:23:24.736]  And it isn't like the previous Ebola outbreaks.
[01:23:24.736 --> 01:23:28.556]  But this is something that they're deliberately trying to keep under the radar.
[01:23:28.556 --> 01:23:35.818]  We've had not only that doctor relate to us what he's heard from other doctors about Ebola patients being disappeared.
[01:23:35.818 --> 01:23:39.719]  We have had other doctors tell that to us off the record.
[01:23:39.719 --> 01:23:42.120]  He was brave enough to come on the record and say that.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:50.026]  We also know that in the New York Fire Department they have been given a bulletin saying not to use the word Ebola on the radio.
[01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:51.808]  So they want to keep that quiet.
[01:23:51.808 --> 01:23:56.492]  They want to keep the consequences of our open borders quiet as well.
[01:23:56.492 --> 01:24:00.135]  They don't want that to be an issue that people are thinking about.
[01:24:00.135 --> 01:24:01.836]  The crime associated with it.
[01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:09.122]  One of the things I want to talk to Mike Cargill about is this shooting that just happened over the weekend with the two sheriff deputies that were shot.
[01:24:09.122 --> 01:24:10.404]  The guy who did that.
[01:24:11.064 --> 01:24:11.244]  I don't
[01:24:32.423 --> 01:24:53.630]  The open borders, that is part of why they are downplaying the Ebola risk, that is something that right after the election, when Obama is a lame duck president, that is when you're really going to see him cut loose with the open borders immigration, and that's when we're really going to find out what the state of Ebola in this country currently is.
[01:24:53.630 --> 01:25:00.032]  Now, as an introduction to what's going on in the Austin area, something that's very similar to what's going on in your area,
[01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:18.077]  Remember that it was just earlier this year that the sheriff in Milwaukee, David Clark, who had come out very strongly for people's rights to defend themselves and protect themselves, being very honest with his constituents, saying, we can't always be there when something happens.
[01:25:18.077 --> 01:25:24.320]  We can get there eventually, but initially, of course, you're going to be on your own when somebody kicks in the door, breaks into your home.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.620]  You need to protect yourself.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.761]  You need to get firearms.
[01:25:26.761 --> 01:25:28.382]  You need to learn how to use them.
[01:25:29.002 --> 01:25:34.945]  And for that, he was targeted by Michael Bloomberg.
[01:25:34.945 --> 01:25:42.069]  $150,000 against him, and over $500,000 was spent in that race, just a local sheriff's office race.
[01:25:42.069 --> 01:25:43.910]  Now, of course, Bill Gates understands that as well.
[01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:50.294]  He's put a million dollars into a fund specifically to attack Second Amendment rights in Washington State.
[01:25:50.294 --> 01:25:52.275]  And he's had a lot of Microsoft billionaires
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:53.741]  Join him.
[01:26:08.464 --> 01:26:09.505]  What they're doing.
[01:26:09.505 --> 01:26:12.446]  Now fortunately in Milwaukee, David Clark did win.
[01:26:12.446 --> 01:26:15.888]  He made the point of saying that the election could not be bought.
[01:26:15.888 --> 01:26:19.149]  And so it kind of backfired on Michael Bloomberg.
[01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:28.634]  But we have people in Austin, as well as people wherever you live, there are politicians who want to get on the bandwagon of banning all firearms.
[01:26:28.634 --> 01:26:33.436]  And remember, this was about, I guess maybe about a year ago or so, this happened at a
[01:26:34.758 --> 01:26:37.969]  An anti-gun rally that was being done at the state capitol.
[01:26:37.969 --> 01:26:40.257]  Here's Jakari Jackson's report to give you a context.
[01:26:48.391 --> 01:26:53.634]  Michael Cargill, during the break they were telling me about it, who owns Central Texas Gun Works, is a great guy.
[01:26:53.634 --> 01:26:56.315]  He's been a frequent guest here.
[01:26:56.315 --> 01:27:08.782]  They just told me he's gonna run against Mike Martinez, Mayor Pro Tem, in Austin, Texas, who's running for mayor and is the heir apparent to Lee Laffingwell, the literal demon.
[01:27:08.782 --> 01:27:12.644]  But, Martinez is even worse!
[01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:13.204]  And I'll be brief.
[01:27:14.002 --> 01:27:20.747]  First of all, to the gentleman that's dying for attention, someone needs to inform him that there is no gun ban currently.
[01:27:20.747 --> 01:27:27.432]  But because of the work that we're doing here today, we will make your side legitimate shortly.
[01:27:27.432 --> 01:27:30.855]  So you hang on to that.
[01:27:30.855 --> 01:27:38.601]  So just talk about these mayors all over the country, like Mike Martinez, the mayor of Pro Tam, who says we will ban your guns.
[01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:45.007]  Once we get him registered, and he works for Bloomberg openly, he heads that up in Texas.
[01:27:45.007 --> 01:27:49.790]  Imagine the yuppies listening to me right now and the so-called trendies in people.
[01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:56.335]  Do you morons really want to be like Chicago, with a crime rate the highest in the world because they've taken the guns?
[01:27:56.335 --> 01:27:59.617]  Do you really want to try to confiscate my guns?
[01:27:59.617 --> 01:28:01.098]  You're like, oh, we're not going to do that.
[01:28:01.098 --> 01:28:03.199]  Come on, Alex.
[01:28:03.199 --> 01:28:04.721]  Nobody's trying to take your tanks.
[01:28:05.868 --> 01:28:07.349]  They haven't, they haven't taken the guns.
[01:28:07.349 --> 01:28:08.170]  Assault weapons.
[01:28:08.170 --> 01:28:09.731]  Ban assault weapons.
[01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:10.672]  They're not trying.
[01:28:10.672 --> 01:28:11.273]  Says right here.
[01:28:11.273 --> 01:28:12.374]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:28:12.374 --> 01:28:13.314]  That's all semi-auto.
[01:28:13.314 --> 01:28:14.836]  Shut up!
[01:28:14.836 --> 01:28:16.557]  Nobody wants your guns.
[01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:20.821]  Nobody wants my guns in New York, in D.C., in Chicago.
[01:28:20.821 --> 01:28:24.944]  Everywhere you people get in control, you ban them.
[01:28:24.944 --> 01:28:31.369]  Councilman Martinez needs to focus his attention on relieving traffic off of I-35 and keep his hands off of our Second Amendment rights.
[01:28:32.972 --> 01:28:33.612]  There you go.
[01:28:33.612 --> 01:28:35.193]  That's the way you beat them, isn't it?
[01:28:35.193 --> 01:28:36.114]  That's absolutely right.
[01:28:36.114 --> 01:28:41.657]  All politics is ultimately local, and we haven't really understood that very well in the Liberty Movement, have we?
[01:28:41.657 --> 01:28:42.557]  No, sir, we have not.
[01:28:42.557 --> 01:28:55.385]  And I'm glad you brought up the Ebola situation, because like the CDC, what they should have done in that incident there, they should have actually sent a team from Atlanta to that hospital to handle that situation.
[01:28:55.385 --> 01:28:55.845]  Absolutely.
[01:28:55.845 --> 01:28:57.966]  And we're going to be right back with Mike Cargill.
[01:28:57.966 --> 01:29:00.187]  We're going to talk about how politics is local.
[01:29:00.187 --> 01:29:00.688]  Stay with us.
[01:29:00.688 --> 01:29:01.188]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:01.568 --> 01:29:02.829]  Another major health threat.
[01:29:02.829 --> 01:29:07.813]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[01:29:07.813 --> 01:29:10.474]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:29:10.474 --> 01:29:17.519]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:20.501]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:29:20.501 --> 01:29:23.544]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:29:23.544 --> 01:29:25.485]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:28.327]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:29:28.387 --> 01:29:34.128]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:29:34.128 --> 01:29:37.629]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:40.730]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:29:40.730 --> 01:29:48.052]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[01:29:48.052 --> 01:29:51.252]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[01:29:59.575 --> 01:30:08.482]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:08.482 --> 01:30:13.626]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:13.626 --> 01:30:22.372]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:22.372 --> 01:30:24.374]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:26.417 --> 01:30:28.559]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:30:28.559 --> 01:30:35.445]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:30:35.445 --> 01:30:38.528]  Blue diamond gussets, got it!
[01:30:40.505 --> 01:30:42.648]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:42.648 --> 01:30:44.429]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:30:44.429 --> 01:30:47.332]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:30:47.332 --> 01:30:53.959]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:30:53.959 --> 01:30:56.662]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:30:56.662 --> 01:30:59.024]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:30:59.024 --> 01:30:59.885]  Others don't.
[01:31:01.144 --> 01:31:03.085]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:31:03.085 --> 01:31:07.627]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[01:31:07.627 --> 01:31:12.090]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:31:12.090 --> 01:31:19.393]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:31:19.393 --> 01:31:28.458]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:28.678 --> 01:31:34.241]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA Force, just one of the key compounds.
[01:31:34.241 --> 01:31:41.826]  BioPQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed-listed published studies.
[01:31:41.826 --> 01:31:44.387]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[01:31:44.387 --> 01:31:49.510]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the Info War.
[01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:54.701]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:54.701 --> 01:31:55.843]  DNA Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:32:01.059 --> 01:32:10.702]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[01:32:10.702 --> 01:32:20.625]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[01:32:20.625 --> 01:32:23.546]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[01:32:23.766 --> 01:32:31.011]  And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[01:32:31.011 --> 01:32:35.674]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[01:32:35.674 --> 01:32:40.657]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad tasting concoctions.
[01:32:40.657 --> 01:32:46.341]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[01:32:46.341 --> 01:32:51.685]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and ozonide technology.
[01:32:51.685 --> 01:32:53.586]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com
[01:32:53.846 --> 01:32:56.468]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:56.468 --> 01:32:57.088]  Big Brother.
[01:32:57.088 --> 01:32:58.209]  Mainstream media.
[01:32:58.209 --> 01:32:59.030]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:24.841 --> 01:33:26.765]  You want answers?
[01:33:26.765 --> 01:33:28.689]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:28.689 --> 01:33:35.061]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.621 --> 01:33:38.941]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:38.941 --> 01:33:40.702]  I'm David Knight, your host today.
[01:33:40.702 --> 01:33:46.023]  I am joined by Michael Cargill, who's running for town council here in Austin.
[01:33:46.023 --> 01:33:49.744]  But it's a story that has applications to wherever you are.
[01:33:49.744 --> 01:33:56.985]  You know, many times we overlook the obvious, simple things that we can do looking for some kind of a miracle solution.
[01:33:56.985 --> 01:33:59.246]  And one of the ways is with your health care.
[01:33:59.246 --> 01:34:03.627]  You know, it's time to get prepared with Survival Shield X2 from InfoWars Life.
[01:34:04.267 --> 01:34:05.268]  I take it every day.
[01:34:05.268 --> 01:34:10.690]  Secure yours at Infowarslife.com and store it in your preparedness pack or your home cabinet.
[01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:24.016]  Really, your own health and your immune system being optimized is one of the most effective ways that you're going to be able to survive regardless of whether it's Ebola or MERS or SARS or whatever you're going to come in contact with.
[01:34:24.016 --> 01:34:25.717]  If you're in top physical condition,
[01:34:26.497 --> 01:34:31.741]  You're going to be able to weather the storm better than any miracle drug is going to do for you.
[01:34:31.741 --> 01:34:48.194]  You can't isolate yourself fully, but what you can do to prepare right now, since there is no cure for many of these diseases that we're faced with, since the vaccines themselves are dangerous, one of the best things you can do is to prepare your immune system and your health with something like Survival Shield X2.
[01:34:48.194 --> 01:34:55.920]  A few drops and you'll receive a powerful dose of key nascent iodine instead of drinking excessive amounts of bad-tasting iodine.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:56.921]  I don't
[01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:27.857]  We've seen from Bloomberg and from Bill Gates at a national level, these are guys who have a national agenda, but they understand that in order to get their gun control agenda, for example, enacted, they're going to have to affect local
[01:35:28.838 --> 01:35:29.799]  Uh, races.
[01:35:29.799 --> 01:35:32.922]  So they're pouring a lot of money into local races.
[01:35:32.922 --> 01:35:36.064]  Even against, uh, pro-gun Democrats.
[01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:50.296]  If you look at the spending that, uh, Michael Bloomberg's Independence USA PAC has put in, he's put in, out of about $5 million, he's put in, 27% of that has been against Democrats who support gun ownership.
[01:35:50.296 --> 01:35:56.802]  He's put in 41% of it in favor of Republicans who are against our Second Amendment rights.
[01:35:57.122 --> 01:35:58.383]  So it can run the other way.
[01:35:58.383 --> 01:36:06.872]  So when you look at that, the bulk of the money that he's putting in, almost 70% is for pro-gun Democrats and anti-gun Republicans.
[01:36:06.872 --> 01:36:07.173]  Absolutely.
[01:36:07.173 --> 01:36:08.874]  And they're doing this all around the country.
[01:36:08.874 --> 01:36:11.077]  They're not doing this in Texas.
[01:36:11.077 --> 01:36:12.118]  They're doing it everywhere.
[01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:21.981]  Bloomberg has actually come out and he said, hey, I have millions and I'm going to spend those millions to affect, you know, the different elections around the country.
[01:36:21.981 --> 01:36:28.123]  New York, you know, they want to bring all those ideas that they have in New York, you know, to your state and your neighborhood.
[01:36:28.123 --> 01:36:31.024]  But we're trying to push back and we're saying, no, we're going to fight.
[01:36:31.024 --> 01:36:39.847]  We don't have that kind of money, but we're going to fight and stand up because this is something that, you know, all of the leaders or local leaders down on that ballot believe in.
[01:36:40.367 --> 01:36:40.727]  That's right.
[01:36:58.664 --> 01:36:59.084]  Absolutely.
[01:36:59.084 --> 01:37:00.025]  And we saw that happen in Milwaukee.
[01:37:16.895 --> 01:37:17.716]  Sheriff Dave Clark.
[01:37:17.716 --> 01:37:24.740]  That's why Bloomberg targeted him with $150,000 that he spent against David Clark.
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:28.022]  It was a half a million dollars in that local sheriff primary.
[01:37:28.022 --> 01:37:31.064]  Of course, there wasn't any Republican running, so that really was the election.
[01:37:31.064 --> 01:37:36.428]  But still, a half a million dollars, and that was outside money being spent against him.
[01:37:36.428 --> 01:37:36.948]  He won.
[01:37:36.948 --> 01:37:39.610]  He said, you're not going to be able to buy this election.
[01:37:39.610 --> 01:37:43.172]  But he had a very loyal constituency, I think, because he had been honest with them.
[01:37:43.172 --> 01:37:43.693]  He had told them,
[01:37:44.033 --> 01:37:46.094]  Look, we're going to do everything we can to protect you.
[01:37:46.094 --> 01:37:47.995]  We're going to come after these guys after the fact.
[01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:51.896]  But while it's going on, a cop can't be everywhere.
[01:37:51.896 --> 01:37:57.058]  They can't be at your door when your door gets kicked in by a home invasion.
[01:37:57.058 --> 01:38:03.220]  So it's important, he said, to be armed as well as to understand how to safely use a firearm.
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:04.661]  That's something that you do in your business.
[01:38:04.661 --> 01:38:07.002]  You not only sell firearms, but you also do training.
[01:38:07.322 --> 01:38:07.762]  Absolutely.
[01:38:07.762 --> 01:38:08.762]  We do a lot of training.
[01:38:08.762 --> 01:38:12.083]  We teach people how to draw that firearm when they need to.
[01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:14.284]  Law enforcement is not going to always be there.
[01:38:14.284 --> 01:38:25.346]  And different little situations we've seen around the country, we've seen it takes, you know, law enforcement anywhere from 12 to 15 minutes to arrive on the scene after the first shots are fired.
[01:38:25.346 --> 01:38:31.687]  So, you know, who's going to be that person that's going to help you and save you, get you out of that building, out of that room, or out of that situation?
[01:38:31.687 --> 01:38:33.268]  That's going to be yourself.
[01:38:33.268 --> 01:38:35.008]  And law enforcement cannot be everywhere.
[01:38:35.368 --> 01:38:41.872]  But they can be an effective backstop against federal intrusions, as you pointed out, with the sheriff especially.
[01:38:41.872 --> 01:38:44.653]  But it goes for a lot of the different offices.
[01:38:44.653 --> 01:38:49.515]  As the liberals know, we've heard from them over and over again, think globally, act locally.
[01:38:49.515 --> 01:38:51.897]  In other words, they have a global agenda.
[01:38:51.897 --> 01:38:56.879]  They have a national agenda, whether it's gun control or whether it's some other aspects.
[01:38:56.879 --> 01:38:59.020]  They have that agenda that they've created.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.682]  They're using this same tactic all over the country.
[01:39:02.262 --> 01:39:05.906]  And yet, they know that it's going to have to be implemented at the local level.
[01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:14.114]  But unfortunately, so often, we put all of our attention on just the highest level offices, like you mentioned before, for governor or for president.
[01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:25.665]  I remember when I was involved with the Libertarian Party back in North Carolina, in order to get ballot access and to retain that, we had to get a fairly high percentage, I think it was 10% of the vote, for president or for governor.
[01:39:26.926 --> 01:39:47.923]  Almost impossible to do, but it makes you focus all your resources on that high-profile race, rather than looking downstream to see what else is going, because when you get someone in who performs an effective backstop against invasions of your personal liberties, that person can also do other things locally that are going to help your quality of life.
[01:39:48.203 --> 01:39:57.969]  Absolutely, and we've seen a lot of times where some of those elections down at the bottom of the ballot takes, you know, three or four votes for that election is decided.
[01:39:57.969 --> 01:40:02.872]  There's a state representative that was elected into office by a difference of four votes.
[01:40:02.872 --> 01:40:06.474]  And you're talking one household could have made a difference in that election.
[01:40:06.474 --> 01:40:09.916]  And some people don't go all the way down, they don't continue on.
[01:40:09.916 --> 01:40:13.098]  In your city council races, a lot of that stuff is nonpartisan.
[01:40:13.098 --> 01:40:16.780]  So people go out and they hit that one button
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.481]  I'm going to vote straight Democrat.
[01:40:18.481 --> 01:40:20.301]  I'm going to vote straight Republican.
[01:40:20.301 --> 01:40:23.082]  They don't pick and choose, you know, and look at the individual.
[01:40:23.082 --> 01:40:28.124]  I encourage people to look at the individuals and vote for the person, not for the party.
[01:40:28.124 --> 01:40:36.688]  And that's very important, as we saw in Jakar's report a little over a year ago when we had Mike Martinez at that gun control rally.
[01:40:37.248 --> 01:40:39.350]  Somebody was holding a stop the gun ban.
[01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:43.974]  He says, we're not going to do that, but hang on to that sign because we're going to make your sign come true.
[01:40:43.974 --> 01:40:46.156]  In other words, we are going to ban guns.
[01:40:46.156 --> 01:40:48.178]  That was an amazing admission.
[01:40:48.178 --> 01:40:54.644]  And here's this from a guy who's just a town councilman, but he has a lot of power to help make that happen.
[01:40:54.644 --> 01:40:56.145]  And now he's moving to the next level.
[01:40:56.145 --> 01:40:56.586]  He's moving
[01:40:56.886 --> 01:40:57.286]  That's right.
[01:41:17.265 --> 01:41:19.247]  Exactly, because traffic is our main problem here.
[01:41:19.247 --> 01:41:19.567]  Yeah.
[01:41:19.567 --> 01:41:28.415]  But, you know, your city council members and those people in those positions are going to be the ones that make that decision when something happens on a national level.
[01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:39.204]  Something happens on a national level when they're going to come down and they're going to say, OK, well, we need to now confine everyone into this area, do these things or do this or do that.
[01:41:39.204 --> 01:41:42.827]  They're going to those people are going to be the key people to make those decisions.
[01:41:43.127 --> 01:41:47.449]  Because it's going to be done in an incremental regulatory way.
[01:41:47.449 --> 01:41:54.571]  In other words, you know, we have these fundamental rights, but they're always looking for ways to turn them into privileges that they can then use to infringe.
[01:41:54.571 --> 01:41:57.772]  And that's why the Second Amendment said you won't infringe on this.
[01:41:57.772 --> 01:42:05.715]  They knew that it was going to be a gradual process of taking away our rights by taking the, moving the boundaries in on the edges.
[01:42:05.715 --> 01:42:08.536]  And that's essentially what it is with these infringements that they're doing.
[01:42:08.536 --> 01:42:11.117]  And the way they enact that is at the local level.
[01:42:11.337 --> 01:42:21.650]  Right, and I always remind people that if you, you know, one thing you need to remember, if you, you know, I hope those chains rest lightly on your wrist if you do not come out to vote.
[01:42:21.650 --> 01:42:23.011]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[01:42:23.011 --> 01:42:30.921]  We're talking to Michael Cargill who's running for town council here in Austin, but again this is something that is going to affect you wherever you are.
[01:42:31.301 --> 01:42:49.186]  Many times, you've got about a week or so before the final election deadline, you need to look at your ballot and look down the ballot and see what these people stand for that are going to be your town councilmen, your mayors, because that's where you're going to see a lot of infringement on your freedom or a defense of your freedom.
[01:42:49.186 --> 01:42:55.707]  We're going to be right back and we're going to talk about this shooting in California where it was an illegal alien deported twice.
[01:42:55.707 --> 01:42:57.408]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Michael Cargill.
[01:43:01.411 --> 01:43:11.978]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[01:43:11.978 --> 01:43:18.442]  Super male vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[01:43:31.272 --> 01:43:34.933]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:43:34.933 --> 01:43:39.215]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:43:39.215 --> 01:43:40.995]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:43:40.995 --> 01:43:46.317]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.

[01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:58.501]  Infidel Body Armor.
[01:43:58.501 --> 01:43:59.441]  Just won't quit.
[01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:07.154]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there was a terror alert on Monday about a potential Fort Hood situation?
[01:44:07.154 --> 01:44:10.456]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:44:10.456 --> 01:44:12.197]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[01:44:12.197 --> 01:44:18.601]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[01:44:18.601 --> 01:44:24.505]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless security by sticking their hands down on the fence on the streets?
[01:44:24.645 --> 01:44:28.609]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:31.551]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[01:44:31.551 --> 01:44:39.959]  If you watch, the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:44:39.959 --> 01:44:42.061]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:44:42.061 --> 01:44:43.082]  It's a war against the truth.
[01:44:43.462 --> 01:44:52.405]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.

[01:45:13.279 --> 01:45:20.347]  We have rejected literally hundreds of products from the InfoWarsLife line because they are not of the very highest quality.

[01:46:23.197 --> 01:46:28.519]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[01:46:28.519 --> 01:46:29.539]  Not our iodine.
[01:46:29.539 --> 01:46:33.341]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[01:46:33.341 --> 01:46:35.882]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[01:46:56.294 --> 01:46:57.795]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.468 --> 01:47:16.516]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:21.874 --> 01:47:23.175]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.175 --> 01:47:26.197]  I'm David Knight, joined in studio with Michael Cargill.
[01:47:26.197 --> 01:47:27.337]  We're out of Austin.
[01:47:27.337 --> 01:47:30.559]  He is actually running for city council.
[01:47:30.559 --> 01:47:34.922]  We're highlighting the idea that you need to be involved locally.
[01:47:34.922 --> 01:47:49.111]  You need to understand what your local candidates are doing, not just what's going on with the governor's race or with the presidential race or with the congressional race, because some of your most effective bulwarks against tyranny are going to be at the local level.
[01:47:49.111 --> 01:47:50.132]  As we mentioned earlier,
[01:47:50.992 --> 01:47:59.475]  It was a sheriff's race that Bloomberg got involved in, trying to shut down pro-Second Amendment sheriff David Clark in Milwaukee.
[01:47:59.475 --> 01:48:00.755]  He spent $150,000.
[01:48:00.755 --> 01:48:03.736]  That race was incredibly expensive for a sheriff's race.
[01:48:03.736 --> 01:48:05.836]  A half a million dollars of outside money being spent.
[01:48:05.836 --> 01:48:11.018]  But of course, Bloomberg's PAC has focused primarily on congressional races.
[01:48:11.678 --> 01:48:25.220]  If we look at some of the things that they've done, they spent $3.3 million to help a Democratic challenger, Gloria McLeod, upset a longtime Democrat, Joe Baca, in California's 35th congressional district.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.561]  $3.3 million.
[01:48:26.561 --> 01:48:36.142]  He can just come in, as he did a couple of years ago, $15 million that he pulled in just in the last couple of weeks, because this guy has billions of dollars.
[01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:40.783]  And of course, we see Bill Gates doing the same thing in Washington state right now.
[01:48:41.563 --> 01:48:42.004]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:48:59.787 --> 01:49:05.873]  It's the City Council and also you know those people that lower ballot there.
[01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:09.177]  What we try to do is we try to support small businesses.
[01:49:09.177 --> 01:49:21.169]  You have a lot of different companies like Uber and Lyft that are trying to get off the ground and you have you know the people that are in the city and the county level that actually are slowing that that progress down and those people
[01:49:22.858 --> 01:49:24.679]  We're going to make a change, make a difference.
[01:49:24.679 --> 01:49:31.343]  We need to support small businesses and that's going to make the city, your city, your county, it's going to make it grow.
[01:49:31.343 --> 01:49:33.544]  It's going to provide jobs for you.
[01:49:33.544 --> 01:49:35.626]  Let's play this quote from Hillary Clinton.
[01:49:35.626 --> 01:49:39.568]  I want to get your reaction to this where she says that businesses don't create jobs.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:50.224]  It's corporations and businesses that create jobs.
[01:49:50.224 --> 01:49:56.229]  You know, that old theory, trickle-down economics.
[01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:57.971]  That has been tried.
[01:49:57.971 --> 01:49:58.992]  That has failed.
[01:50:00.330 --> 01:50:04.352]  I think the problem is that they didn't trickle enough on us.
[01:50:04.352 --> 01:50:06.613]  Most of her friends keep all the money.
[01:50:06.613 --> 01:50:08.194]  They don't even trickle on us.
[01:50:08.194 --> 01:50:12.296]  I started my business out of my living room.
[01:50:12.296 --> 01:50:14.517]  I didn't need anyone else's help.
[01:50:14.517 --> 01:50:16.118]  I didn't need any assistance or anything like that.
[01:50:16.118 --> 01:50:21.180]  I started it from scratch, from zero zilch, and built it up to the business that it is now.
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:27.083]  And your goal was not to create jobs, but it turned out to be what you had to do in order to grow your business.
[01:50:27.083 --> 01:50:28.264]  You had to create jobs.
[01:50:28.264 --> 01:50:28.524]  Correct.
[01:50:29.224 --> 01:50:31.045]  What you're trying to do is you're trying to create a product.
[01:50:31.045 --> 01:50:32.526]  You're trying to create a service.
[01:50:32.526 --> 01:50:37.849]  You're putting your hard-earned money in, as well as your labor, to build it.
[01:50:37.849 --> 01:50:42.311]  But we hear from Hillary Clinton the same thing that we hear from Barack Obama, that you didn't build this.
[01:50:42.311 --> 01:50:45.113]  That businesses don't create jobs.
[01:50:45.113 --> 01:50:48.635]  And what some of them can do is they can prevent people from creating jobs.
[01:50:48.635 --> 01:50:50.816]  They can prevent, you know, expansion.
[01:50:50.816 --> 01:50:51.096]  Yes.
[01:50:51.096 --> 01:50:54.998]  So we need to get people in there that will, you know, remove some of those roadblocks.
[01:50:54.998 --> 01:50:55.499]  Yes.
[01:50:55.499 --> 01:50:57.720]  Remove some of the structure trying to
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:50:58.860]  Absolutely.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:51:00.821]  Basically, government is there as an inhibitor of job creation.
[01:51:00.821 --> 01:51:03.842]  And so what they can do is they can basically get out of the way to allow people to do that.
[01:51:03.842 --> 01:51:07.303]  And of course, it is the small businesses that we see the most job creation come from.
[01:51:22.809 --> 01:51:30.536]  Politically connected crony capitalists that have their way with Hillary Clinton's and the Harry Reid's and the Nancy Pelosi and the George Bush's.
[01:51:30.536 --> 01:51:36.001]  It's not those people that we see creating the most jobs, it's actually the small local businesses.
[01:51:36.001 --> 01:51:46.350]  That's why, you know, just as you try to do business with local businesses to try to help your community, that's why you need to be involved in what's going on down ticket
[01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:48.931]  The races that are not so high profile.
[01:51:48.931 --> 01:51:51.752]  That's why we're talking to Michael Cargill here.
[01:51:51.752 --> 01:51:59.275]  Now one of the other things that comes up, of course, you mentioned the importance of a sheriff in terms of protecting your rights.
[01:51:59.275 --> 01:52:04.177]  I just went to a forum within the last week here on secure communities.
[01:52:04.177 --> 01:52:05.438]  Now that is the
[01:52:06.238 --> 01:52:23.329]  The program that was created by Bush as well as by Obama administration, where a sheriff, if they pick an illegal alien up after they've arrested them and they're holding them, they will report it to ICE and hold them for up to 48 hours so that ICE can take a look at their background.
[01:52:23.877 --> 01:52:39.828]  Now, what they were doing in this community meeting, they were coming down hard on the sheriff, who was a Democrat, telling him, hey, if you're going to send information about illegal aliens who've committed crime to ICE, you're in the wrong party.
[01:52:39.828 --> 01:52:40.988]  You need to get out of this party.
[01:52:40.988 --> 01:52:41.829]  You shouldn't be doing that.
[01:52:41.829 --> 01:52:44.591]  And yet we see that this California cop killer
[01:52:45.371 --> 01:52:47.413]  Uh, who killed two cops over the weekend.
[01:52:47.413 --> 01:52:51.175]  This was somebody who has been deported on multiple times.
[01:52:51.175 --> 01:52:55.879]  I don't even see that the deportation is effective as long as we've got such open borders.
[01:52:55.879 --> 01:52:59.161]  But it was our city council talking about the importance of elections, okay?
[01:52:59.161 --> 01:53:11.510]  This is, whether or not this is going to happen in our community comes down to the sheriff, who at this point is standing against the city council, who is telling him, don't tell ICE if you pick somebody up that has violated the law that's an illegal alien.
[01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:28.781]  And that's why that county official is very important, because that person is going to allow ICE to come in and say, hey, let's take a look at this guy's records, okay, and let's go ahead and hold him, because he's been here, you know, several times, he's gone back, come over, gone back, come over, and he's committed crimes.
[01:53:28.781 --> 01:53:36.246]  The particular case that you're talking about, you know, that county official, he's going to be facing some very hard times when it's time for his reelection.
[01:53:37.426 --> 01:53:37.987]  Let's hope so.
[01:54:07.066 --> 01:54:11.007]  Yeah, Mexico has one standard, but we're supposed to have a completely different standard.
[01:54:11.007 --> 01:54:13.628]  We're supposed to not patrol our borders.
[01:54:13.628 --> 01:54:16.189]  We're supposed to let everyone in whether or not they're sick.
[01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:18.129]  Remember when they had the cruise ship?
[01:54:18.129 --> 01:54:21.290]  We had the lab technician from Dallas do a self-quarantine.
[01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:30.573]  She didn't have it, but she heard that they had been lax on the quarantine issues, and so she wanted to declare that she had been working there when she didn't put herself in quarantine.
[01:54:30.573 --> 01:54:31.333]  Belize wouldn't take her.
[01:54:31.913 --> 01:54:33.194]  Mexico wouldn't take her.
[01:54:33.194 --> 01:54:36.577]  They had to ship the entire cruise ship back to Texas.
[01:54:36.577 --> 01:54:44.023]  Every other country in the world patrols their border to make sure that people are not bringing a pandemic into their country.
[01:54:44.023 --> 01:54:45.584]  We used to do that at Ellis Island.
[01:54:45.584 --> 01:54:49.987]  They used to inspect people to make sure that they weren't sick as they were coming into the country.
[01:54:49.987 --> 01:54:54.751]  We also have a right to know whether somebody has a criminal background when they're coming into our country.
[01:54:55.191 --> 01:55:01.398]  And yet with the open borders policy that we see, and we're going to really see that accelerate after the election.
[01:55:01.398 --> 01:55:07.284]  That's why it's very important for us to have in place patriots who are going to have the backbone to stand up to this.
[01:55:07.284 --> 01:55:10.568]  And a lot of that is going to have to happen at the local level.
[01:55:10.788 --> 01:55:17.991]  Right, we need to make this president a lame duck president so that he does not have any power to do anything his last few years.
[01:55:17.991 --> 01:55:27.495]  Because if we allow some of the people down on that ballot to get elected that are not looking out for our best interest, then we're going to have problems with people crossing over the border.
[01:55:27.495 --> 01:55:29.496]  We're going to have problems with Ebola.
[01:55:29.496 --> 01:55:31.777]  We're going to have problems with our crime.
[01:55:31.777 --> 01:55:36.179]  Our crime is going to increase just like we saw in that incident right there with that school shooting.
[01:55:36.459 --> 01:55:36.839]  Yeah.
[01:55:36.839 --> 01:55:39.541]  I mean, twice kicked out of the country.
[01:55:39.541 --> 01:55:40.362]  Twice.
[01:55:40.362 --> 01:55:41.903]  And now he's killed a police officer.
[01:55:41.903 --> 01:55:43.904]  I want someone to explain that to me.
[01:55:43.904 --> 01:55:46.226]  He actually killed two police officers.
[01:55:46.226 --> 01:55:49.248]  This was a guy who had been sent out.
[01:55:49.248 --> 01:55:52.030]  He was arrested and convicted in Arizona for narcotics possession in 1997.
[01:55:53.271 --> 01:55:57.055]  And then he was later arrested and sent back to Mexico again in 2001.
[01:55:57.055 --> 01:56:04.203]  One of the things that I heard, so that second deportation was simply because he was here illegally or had prior convictions.
[01:56:04.203 --> 01:56:11.632]  One of the things that I heard in this meeting against secure communities was you shouldn't send somebody back just because they're only here illegally.
[01:56:12.472 --> 01:56:33.239]  Okay, that's what they're telling the sheriff and that's what they're saying, you know, you're in the wrong party and it's like we need to understand where people are and we need to understand too that in the case of the sheriff I don't know what else he stands for and I'm not endorsing him but at least on this issue he's a Democrat fighting his own party and we need to understand that this isn't something that you can simply do by voting a partisan checklist.
[01:56:33.239 --> 01:56:37.661]  You need to understand where these people are on the issues that are important as you go down the ballot.
[01:56:37.981 --> 01:56:47.206]  And the majority of your county officials, these sheriffs that are participating in this program, what they're doing is they're saying, hey, this person here has committed multiple crimes.
[01:56:47.206 --> 01:56:50.068]  This person has three DWIs.
[01:56:50.068 --> 01:56:56.532]  This person has actually been charged or convicted of a sex offender with a minor, you know, sex with a minor.
[01:56:56.912 --> 01:56:58.594]  So we're talking major offenses here.
[01:56:58.594 --> 01:56:59.995]  We're not talking about a traffic ticket.
[01:56:59.995 --> 01:57:01.496]  We're not talking about running a stop sign.
[01:57:01.496 --> 01:57:03.838]  We're not talking about a Class C misdemeanor.
[01:57:03.838 --> 01:57:06.500]  We're talking about Class B, A's, and felonies.
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:07.241]  They need to go.
[01:57:07.241 --> 01:57:09.663]  We don't need to have that riffraff in our country.
[01:57:09.663 --> 01:57:10.003]  That's right.
[01:57:10.003 --> 01:57:11.704]  It's a very dangerous thing to have that.
[01:57:11.704 --> 01:57:16.128]  We're talking to Michael Cargill, who is running for town council here in Austin.
[01:57:16.128 --> 01:57:19.551]  What's your website address that they can find out about you, Mike?
[01:57:19.551 --> 01:57:21.772]  It's cargillfortexas.com.
[01:57:21.772 --> 01:57:24.395]  That's cargillfortexas.com.
[01:57:25.015 --> 01:57:25.756]  Very important.
[01:57:25.756 --> 01:57:32.141]  Very important that you look at what the people down ticket stand for in your location.
[01:57:32.141 --> 01:57:37.726]  This is something that we're only going to win if we get involved and understand what is happening at the local level.
[01:57:37.726 --> 01:57:45.652]  And don't underestimate the importance of the Sheriff, of the City Council, in protecting your freedoms, as well as just doing the right things.
[01:57:45.652 --> 01:57:48.254]  Making sure that traffic is flowing the right way.
[01:57:48.254 --> 01:57:49.936]  The things that government should do.
