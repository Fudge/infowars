[00:00.000 --> 00:13.680]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:13.680 --> 00:21.520]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today on this Sunday October the
[00:21.520 --> 00:28.240]  26 2014 we have an amazing conspiracy theory for you and this one doesn't come from the
[00:28.240 --> 00:34.800]  internet this one actually comes from AT&T and FEMA you know we reported on Friday that the
[00:34.800 --> 00:39.920]  White House emergency alert system had interrupted TV viewers across America Austin across North
[00:39.920 --> 00:46.560]  Carolina many other places they got a message on their screen telling them not to use their
[00:46.560 --> 00:51.680]  phones and mentioning something about Ebola and evidently they lost their service for quite some
[00:51.680 --> 00:58.400]  time now AT&T has put up on Facebook this is an update to the story has put up on Facebook that
[00:59.120 --> 01:04.240]  earlier today an emergency message was carried on our networks as well as some other providers
[01:04.240 --> 01:10.480]  and then here's what they say a FEMA investigation indicates that a nationally syndicated radio show
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.040]  not affiliated with AT&T accidentally sent a message over the national emergency alert system
[01:17.040 --> 01:25.280]  now that raises a lot of questions each one of those clauses there first of all how could a radio
[01:25.280 --> 01:30.400]  show that is not affiliated with AT&T take over their system and accidentally put out a message
[01:30.400 --> 01:35.280]  as one person said for close to two hours they took out this over they're not even affiliate
[01:35.280 --> 01:39.200]  with you and they took it over I don't know if they're referring to us because we're the ones
[01:39.200 --> 01:46.240]  who broke the story it was Paul Joseph Watson's story on Friday basically showing pictures of
[01:46.240 --> 01:52.160]  what people had put up had happened to their television sets this is absolutely amazing
[01:52.160 --> 01:59.120]  that this would be AT&T saying that FEMA told them that a radio show accidentally put this message
[01:59.120 --> 02:05.840]  out over their U-verse system that's a pretty amazing revelation but we've got something
[02:06.480 --> 02:11.120]  just as amazing from Hillary Clinton listen to this soundbite this came out over this last
[02:11.120 --> 02:16.960]  week and listen to what Hillary says about where jobs come from don't let anybody tell you that
[02:18.320 --> 02:27.120]  you know it's corporations and businesses that create jobs you know that old theory trickle
[02:27.120 --> 02:35.760]  down economics that has been tried yeah right has failed yeah we know that jobs don't come from
[02:35.760 --> 02:40.720]  businesses it's not people working really hard saving their money starting a small business
[02:40.720 --> 02:45.760]  they don't they don't create jobs no it's it's first ladies that create jobs it's governors it's
[02:45.760 --> 02:51.520]  presidents who create jobs that is one of my pet peeves when I watch these debates even Republicans
[02:51.520 --> 02:56.000]  I shouldn't say even Republicans but especially Republicans like to brag about how many jobs
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.200]  they created as governor when they're running for president at that point I'm throwing stuff at the
[03:01.200 --> 03:06.240]  television said it line if you understand the way the world works you are too this is Hillary's
[03:06.240 --> 03:13.120]  Clinton's moment where she's uh imitating Obama saying you didn't build that look everybody knows
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.840]  that it's businesses that create jobs that's not their intention but it's what they have to do if
[03:17.840 --> 03:22.800]  they're going to grow their business one person can't do it all they're going to have to hire people
[03:22.800 --> 03:28.400]  that's one of the reasons why small businesses innovative businesses create more jobs than the
[03:28.400 --> 03:34.080]  crony capitalist that Hillary Clinton hangs out with how many jobs does Hillary Clinton create
[03:34.080 --> 03:39.440]  when she speaks for a quarter of a million dollars at a university she's got some assistants maybe a
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.920]  hairstylist I don't know looking at her maybe she doesn't have a hairstylist but you know how many
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.360]  how many jobs does she create those are the jobs that we want created you know we have a situation
[03:49.360 --> 03:55.520]  right now where the federal government is creating so many jobs and places that we don't want them
[03:55.520 --> 04:01.280]  like IRS agents to enforce Obamacare we should be very concerned about that because that's shutting
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.640]  the economy down they're not providing people a service they're not offering them a sandwich or a
[04:06.640 --> 04:13.600]  hot dog or some other service or product no they're shutting things down and that has a direct
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.680]  application to whether or not you will be able to start a business someday it has a direct
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.080]  application as to whether or not you will have a job but they're going to shut that down we're
[04:22.080 --> 04:27.920]  also going to be talking about how the IRS is moving now accelerating confiscating money from
[04:27.920 --> 04:33.200]  businesses because of the way and the timing in which they make their deposits they call it
[04:33.200 --> 04:39.040]  structuring and they confiscate that money from small businesses without even charging them with
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.280]  a crime it's a major story breaking on the New York Times it's been around for a very long time
[04:43.280 --> 04:47.520]  it's good that mainstream media is finally picking this up better late than never we're
[04:47.520 --> 04:51.520]  going to be back with that and some breaking admissions from current congressional testimony
[04:51.520 --> 05:03.360]  about ebola stay with us we'll be right back the experts are clear sunlight purified water

[06:03.360 --> 06:09.280]  there are of course those who do not want us to speak just let me say even now orders are being
[06:09.280 --> 06:15.280]  shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way it's chances at them damn it why
[06:16.000 --> 06:21.760]  because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation words will always retain their
[06:21.760 --> 06:28.000]  power words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen the enunciation of truth
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.880]  there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't there you decided sir you wanted
[06:34.880 --> 06:40.880]  it for proof you told me every television in London cruelty and intolerance and oppression
[06:40.880 --> 06:45.760]  and where once you had the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit you now have
[06:45.760 --> 06:51.760]  sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and setting your sub machine cameras
[06:51.760 --> 06:57.280]  how did this happen who's to blame well certainly there are those who are more responsible than
[06:57.280 --> 07:03.600]  others they will be held accountable but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty
[07:03.600 --> 07:12.160]  you need only look into a mirror i know why you did it i know you were afraid who wouldn't be war
[07:12.160 --> 07:18.880]  terror disease there were a myriad of problems to conspire to corrupt your reason and rob you of
[07:18.880 --> 07:25.200]  your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor
[07:25.200 --> 07:31.280]  adam subtler he promised you order he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your
[07:31.280 --> 07:45.680]  silent obedient consent there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity
[07:45.680 --> 07:52.000]  the time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war
[07:52.000 --> 08:00.480]  welcome to the alex jones show i'm david night on this sunday october 26 2014
[08:01.360 --> 08:06.960]  now if you were looking at info wars dot com on friday and listening to our show you heard us
[08:06.960 --> 08:12.000]  break the news that the white house emergency alert system had interrupted tv viewers across
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.600]  america with a message that came up and said don't use your phone and some information about the
[08:17.600 --> 08:23.840]  ebola outbreak now there's been an update to this at and t which was running the stations
[08:23.840 --> 08:28.480]  that this occurred on said that they were told they put this up on their facebook account they
[08:28.480 --> 08:35.680]  were told that uh fema investigation indicated that a nationally syndicated radio show not
[08:35.680 --> 08:41.360]  affiliated with at and t accidentally sent a message over the national emergency alert system
[08:41.360 --> 08:49.280]  now that raises a lot of amazing questions first of all how could a nationally syndicated radio
[08:49.280 --> 08:53.920]  show maybe they're talking about us i don't know they don't name any names uh we were the ones who
[08:53.920 --> 08:59.520]  broke the story how could a radio show even if it is nationally syndicated if it's not affiliated
[08:59.520 --> 09:06.800]  with at and t how could it broadcast over their network how could it do that accidentally how
[09:06.800 --> 09:12.000]  could it take their system down as some of these uh comments are saying on facebook for two hours
[09:12.560 --> 09:18.240]  how could that happen let's go back to that report that was filed on friday here's paul joseph
[09:18.240 --> 09:34.640]  watson breaking that down for you americans watching television were puzzled earlier today
[09:34.640 --> 09:39.920]  when their programs were interrupted by an emergency alert message from the white house
[09:39.920 --> 09:45.600]  telling them that their channels would automatically be changed for an emergency alert and that they
[09:45.600 --> 09:51.440]  were not to use their phones in order to keep lines open this is the message that viewers in
[09:51.440 --> 10:09.280]  austin atlanta north carolina and numerous other areas of the country saw earlier today
[10:21.680 --> 10:30.240]  and these are clips for those of you listening on radio these are clips of television programs
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.240]  where you can see that they're putting the banner across there about the emergency broadcast system
[10:36.240 --> 10:43.120]  which is only available to the white house twitter reporting the same thing brian jackoo tow who's in
[10:43.120 --> 10:51.040]  atlanta georgia got the same emergency broadcast but again in each case no alert message followed
[10:51.040 --> 10:57.760]  it was seemingly a test run forcing the tv channels to tune into the local news station
[10:57.760 --> 11:04.800]  for a white house alert which never came shortly after the alert w s o c tv which is based out
[11:04.800 --> 11:10.080]  of charlotte north carolina put out an alert a message on their website saying it was looking
[11:10.080 --> 11:15.280]  into the emergency alert that aired at around eight thirty a m on friday morning after hearing
[11:15.280 --> 11:21.120]  that radio stations and television stations broadcast the message so the local news channels
[11:21.120 --> 11:27.600]  that broadcast the message aren't even aware that it was planned so if this was a test then it wasn't
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.960]  communicated to any of the radio or television stations in advance by the federal government
[11:33.600 --> 11:38.960]  so at and t put out a statement to uverse customers it seems that this was restricted to
[11:38.960 --> 11:45.280]  uverse customers saying that earlier today uverse tv customers may have received an emergency alert
[11:45.280 --> 11:50.080]  notification we confirm that there is no emergency at this time and we are investigating why this
[11:50.080 --> 11:55.280]  occurred we apologize for any convenience so the alant to journal constitution called it
[11:55.840 --> 12:03.440]  alarming but erroneous that viewers receive this message so they're claiming that it was a mistake
[12:03.440 --> 12:10.000]  that this was broadcast the eighteen t and uverse spokespeople and yet we know for a fact that the
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.520]  white house emergency alert system is completely outside of the control of radio and television
[12:17.520 --> 12:24.960]  stations so when they want to broadcast that emergency signal be it real or a test it's automatic
[12:24.960 --> 12:31.280]  the radio the television station has no choice to interrupt or to dismiss or to opt out of the signal
[12:31.280 --> 12:38.720]  if it's directly from the white house by law stations are required by federal law to relay
[12:38.720 --> 12:46.160]  ean emergency action notification messages immediately so the encoders and decoders are
[12:46.160 --> 12:51.760]  actually installed directly within the broadcast systems of the television and radio stations
[12:51.760 --> 12:58.960]  who have no control no power to interrupt these messages they come directly from the federal
[12:58.960 --> 13:06.480]  government and what's concerning is the fact that these emergency messages we reported back in 2011
[13:06.480 --> 13:12.560]  in the case of the plan alert program which is the same system but for mobile phones for cell
[13:12.560 --> 13:19.920]  phones in new jersey caused panic when authorities in the state sent out an emergency alert via
[13:19.920 --> 13:27.120]  Verizon which warned residents that there was a civil emergency in progress and advising them to
[13:27.120 --> 13:35.520]  quote take shelter so then panicked citizens flooded 911 lines with anxious calls because of this
[13:35.520 --> 13:41.600]  test which wasn't supposed to go out so now we have another example of a test going out
[13:41.600 --> 13:49.440]  amidst a national concern about the Ebola outbreak the white house is sending out emergency alert
[13:49.440 --> 13:55.760]  messages quote by mistake telling people not to use their phone lines and advising them to wait
[13:55.760 --> 14:02.240]  for an emergency broadcast directly from the government which never came and so as you can
[14:02.240 --> 14:10.720]  imagine this has caused huge consternation on conspiracy websites and you know i'm not one
[14:10.720 --> 14:15.840]  for believing embracing every conspiracy but i think with just cause that people are concerned
[14:15.840 --> 14:21.920]  about this especially given obama's remarks a couple of days ago when he said that Ebola is a
[14:21.920 --> 14:27.920]  trial run for a deadlier airborne disease and that this Ebola situation was allowing the federal
[14:27.920 --> 14:35.360]  government to prepare so now two days after those comments we have this bizarre emergency message
[14:35.360 --> 14:40.240]  from the white house being sent out to people across the country urging them not to use their
[14:40.240 --> 14:46.800]  telephone lines and to stand by for an emergency message from the white house amidst this national
[14:46.800 --> 14:54.240]  Ebola situation a message which never came so is the emergency alert message that went out today
[14:54.240 --> 15:00.880]  part of another trial run to see how americans would respond i don't know it's definitely
[15:00.880 --> 15:08.240]  disconcerting that they would commit this mistake this mistake test run of the emergency alert system
[15:08.800 --> 15:14.960]  amidst the general concern about the Ebola outbreak let me know in the comments below if
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.320]  you saw this so there you have it here's the emergency alert system that is under the direct
[15:20.320 --> 15:25.440]  control of the white house as fox news put pointed out it can only be activated by the president
[15:25.440 --> 15:31.600]  in times of emergency they put this out and then when people get upset about the false alarm they
[15:31.600 --> 15:38.960]  blame it on a nationally syndicated radio show that they say is not affiliated with AT&T the ones
[15:38.960 --> 15:43.600]  that it went out over their network that it went out over i guess they're referring to us because
[15:43.600 --> 15:48.080]  we're the ones who broke that that's one of the most amazing conspiracy theories you'll ever hear
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.320]  and it comes from thema stick with us you're going to hear an amazing lie from hillary clinton
[15:52.320 --> 15:58.400]  businesses don't create jobs she's doubling down on obama's lies about you didn't build that stay

[20:12.560 --> 20:20.720]  i'm david night i'm the sunday october 26 2014 and domestic it's alex jones
[20:20.720 --> 20:29.920]  now we were just talking just before this break about this white house emergency alert system
[20:29.920 --> 20:33.760]  that went out and of course it put out this weird message everybody was saying you know what's
[20:33.760 --> 20:39.360]  this about it's telling us not to use our cell phones as warning people uh you know stay off
[20:39.360 --> 20:44.560]  the phone it went out over the at&t uverse connections evidently it was their customers
[20:44.560 --> 20:50.240]  that it was focused on and at&t then responded to this report to this article that paul joseph
[20:50.240 --> 20:55.920]  wasan had on friday blaming a quote nationally syndicated radio station for sending the alert
[20:55.920 --> 21:01.680]  message despite the fact that only the federal government actually only the white house sends
[21:01.680 --> 21:07.280]  out these emergency alerts this is something that's under control of the president and so it raises
[21:07.280 --> 21:12.480]  a lot of questions but here's where this is going to play out in the broader scheme of things
[21:13.120 --> 21:18.640]  it's not just a an emergency alert that can scare people uh when they put it out without
[21:18.640 --> 21:23.120]  any reason like they just did and it actually went out for a couple of hours the questions remain
[21:23.120 --> 21:28.720]  how could a radio show that's not affiliated with at&t as they said put this out of course that was
[21:28.720 --> 21:34.720]  what fema told them to tell the public but it's really not just the communications that they
[21:34.720 --> 21:40.080]  want to control for people telling them don't use your phones even being able to shut down broadcast
[21:40.080 --> 21:47.360]  television at the same time this is also about driverless cars this is about controlling not only
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.400]  your communications but you're going to eventually have your transportation your movement controlled
[21:52.400 --> 21:57.600]  very much as well understand that driverless cars are not self-driving cars as they like to tell
[21:57.600 --> 22:03.120]  everybody right now a self-driving car is essentially what you've got you're driving the car yourself
[22:03.120 --> 22:09.200]  what you're going to have is a computer driven car under control of the government or the large
[22:09.200 --> 22:13.920]  corporations that work with the government that the government works for where you can't tell where
[22:13.920 --> 22:21.280]  one ends and the other begins like uber the ceo of uber has said what makes his service and other
[22:21.280 --> 22:27.200]  taxi services expensive is that other dude in the car with you when you're driving around he said
[22:27.200 --> 22:31.360]  once we get rid of that other dude in the car in other words we're just going to have a computer
[22:31.360 --> 22:36.000]  controlled car once we get rid of that other dude you're going to find that it's very cheap as a
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.080]  matter of fact it's going to be so cheap that you're not going to want to have individual car
[22:42.080 --> 22:47.840]  ownership we're going to go down the same path and i think it's only about five to six years
[22:47.840 --> 22:54.400]  they're accelerating this very very rapidly if you look it was just back in march and april
[22:54.400 --> 22:58.880]  that they were talking about how the legal framework was being adjusted at that time and the european
[22:58.880 --> 23:05.200]  union also in the united states allowing them to legally run self-driving autonomous cars
[23:05.200 --> 23:12.320]  on the streets in europe and in america the technology is not the obstacle it's really the
[23:12.320 --> 23:18.400]  legal issues and customer acceptance i think a lot of people don't like to drive they want to
[23:18.400 --> 23:22.560]  just sit there they would just love to sit there and play with facebook and twitter as they're
[23:22.560 --> 23:28.880]  being transported from place to place they don't understand the issues of autonomy and liberty
[23:29.440 --> 23:33.600]  and they don't understand how this is going to put them under the control of the government
[23:33.600 --> 23:39.520]  understand that the very interstate system was originally started by the military it was eisenhower
[23:39.520 --> 23:43.920]  who took a trip uh up in the northeast and he was going from one place to the other he wrote a book
[23:43.920 --> 23:49.920]  on his experience how difficult it was to move these military uh this military convoy from one
[23:49.920 --> 23:54.320]  part of the country to the other on the current road system then during world war two he saw the
[23:54.320 --> 24:01.360]  autobahn that hitler had created and said we've got to have that their first primary concern was to
[24:01.360 --> 24:08.080]  move the military around but they also today want to control not only what opinions are being formed
[24:08.080 --> 24:12.480]  on the internet they not only want to control the information that you receive with these emergency
[24:12.480 --> 24:17.680]  alerts but they also want to be able to control your movement this is going to be the perfect way
[24:17.680 --> 24:22.800]  that they'll be able to do it and it's going to go down the same way that smartphones did remember
[24:22.800 --> 24:31.120]  the the files that were released from the nsa talking as part of the snowden releases and it showed
[24:31.120 --> 24:37.360]  a couple of presentations one of them said who would have thought in 1984 and they showed the
[24:37.360 --> 24:43.120]  picture the famous iconic 1984 commercial from apple about the iphone they said who would have
[24:43.120 --> 24:48.160]  thought in 1984 show a picture of that that this would become big brother the next that's the next
[24:48.160 --> 24:54.400]  slide and they show uh steve jobs holding up an iphone so they say the iphone would become big
[24:54.400 --> 24:59.840]  brother then the third slide says and that they would willingly pay for it and it shows everybody
[24:59.840 --> 25:05.920]  lined up feverishly to get their new iphone or their new ipads that's the way it's going to happen
[25:05.920 --> 25:12.720]  with self-driving cars as they like to call it people will pay for their own slavery they'll put
[25:12.720 --> 25:18.800]  some features some bells and whistles in it they'll make life even more passive even more comfortable
[25:18.800 --> 25:25.520]  for you and you will give up your freedom to ride in this driverless car that's going to run you
[25:25.520 --> 25:28.720]  everywhere you think that you want to go of course there will be places that will be off
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.280]  limit to you three times so they can just shut down transportation or maybe they'll just key
[25:33.280 --> 25:40.000]  something in and say uh drive joe to the nearest fema camp and there you go just like in minority
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.400]  report remember that he gets in the car locks the doors says it's going to take him to the police
[25:44.400 --> 25:49.360]  station uh that's the future if they're allowed to do this type of thing when they take over
[25:49.360 --> 25:56.960]  communications and make make this clear this is something that is it's not just taking control
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.680]  of the different broadcast frequencies we see them moving in the internet range we see them also
[26:01.680 --> 26:08.000]  moving to shut down and monitor and adjust content we've had the director of the FCC point out
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.160]  that they wanted to do this survey that was broken a few months ago where they wanted to do a survey
[26:12.160 --> 26:18.000]  of print newsrooms of internet news as well as broadcast news they don't even have the authority
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.960]  to look at content of broadcast stations let alone these other outlets but that's where they're
[26:22.960 --> 26:28.880]  moving he also the same FCC commissioner also pointed out that the national science foundation
[26:28.880 --> 26:34.720]  put out a multimillion dollar grant in a truthy project saying essentially they were going to
[26:34.720 --> 26:40.080]  look at how memes were created how information was passed on social networks they were going to vet
[26:40.080 --> 26:45.520]  that and see what was truthful and what wasn't it how opinions are shaped that's what they're really
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.240]  concerned about how opinions are shaped they're not concerned about the truth that's why we see
[26:50.240 --> 26:57.280]  this phone he explanation from at&t about how a radio show could hijack their emergency alert system
[26:57.280 --> 27:01.280]  that's under control of the president of course they don't say who that is but i imagine they're
[27:01.280 --> 27:05.920]  referring to us since we broke that now we've also got an amazing admission that came out of just
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.360]  a couple of days ago over this weekend from hillary clinton remember when obama said you didn't
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.040]  build that if you got a business you didn't build that well hillary clinton said this don't let anybody
[27:17.040 --> 27:27.280]  tell you that um you know it's corporations and businesses that create jobs you know that old
[27:27.280 --> 27:38.320]  theory trickle down economics that has been tried that has failed there you go so it's not if you
[27:38.320 --> 27:43.760]  got a job you didn't get that job because that was created by somebody who worked hard who saved
[27:43.760 --> 27:48.640]  their money who created a company who saw it growing and of course one man can't control
[27:48.640 --> 27:52.320]  a growing company he's going to have to hire people businesses you know there's an element
[27:52.320 --> 27:58.640]  of truth in what she has to say that uh their their goal is not to create jobs their goal is to
[27:58.640 --> 28:05.600]  create profits but in order to do that they have to create jobs say unlike hillary clinton
[28:06.240 --> 28:10.720]  they have to create jobs now she does create jobs you know the governors and the presidents when
[28:10.720 --> 28:15.440]  they go to the debates and they brag about how many jobs they create in most of those cases
[28:15.440 --> 28:21.600]  they're taking credit for the hard work the savings of other people but in many cases they do create
[28:21.600 --> 28:28.720]  jobs you know obama has created 16 000 irs jobs as part of obama care now he's also driven out of
[28:28.720 --> 28:34.000]  business a lot of independent physicians driven them into retirement made it clear to them that they
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.560]  don't want to stay in that business that's the fruit of it it's not how many jobs you create but
[28:38.560 --> 28:45.040]  what you're creating the jobs to do and it's not the type of jobs we want to see being created
[28:45.040 --> 28:49.120]  right after the break we're going to talk about a story that's breaking the new york times a law
[28:49.120 --> 28:55.200]  let's see irs sees accounts on suspicion with no crime required stay with us we're going to be right

[33:13.360 --> 33:28.800]  we are on the march the empire is on the run alex jones and the gcm radio network
[33:31.840 --> 33:35.760]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today and we're going to be
[33:35.760 --> 33:40.880]  joined in the next hour with someone who is running for local office but who is also a small
[33:40.880 --> 33:47.120]  businessman running a gun shop and i think it's something that we need to look at carefully
[33:47.120 --> 33:52.080]  when we say that uh uh most of the time we're looking at national office we're looking at
[33:52.080 --> 33:57.280]  the president we're looking at congressional races or maybe even at governor's races they
[33:57.280 --> 34:02.880]  understand that all politics is local that's what the people who are successful understand
[34:02.880 --> 34:08.960]  but they have us focused almost exclusively on national issues and of course those are important
[34:08.960 --> 34:14.080]  but how are we going to fight it when we have someone like obama who is opening our borders to
[34:15.040 --> 34:20.640]  crime to disease to so many different things creating wars abroad how do we fight that do we
[34:20.640 --> 34:26.080]  fight that by sending congressmen to washington maybe we fight it by getting people elected at
[34:26.080 --> 34:32.000]  the state and local level who are patriots maybe that's the way we do it maybe as they say thank
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.360]  globally and act locally maybe we need to think about liberty and act locally maybe that's what
[34:37.360 --> 34:40.960]  we need to do so we're going to talk to someone who's running here you're going to find a lot of
[34:40.960 --> 34:46.400]  commonality between what he's doing here and what you can do in your area you need to be
[34:46.400 --> 34:50.640]  involved in elections so that you know what's happening at the local level it's where the
[34:50.640 --> 34:55.360]  sheriffs are where the town council are that's where you can put some effective checks on this
[34:55.360 --> 35:01.200]  abuse of power in washington where it may be so corrupt that you can't get a control of it anymore
[35:01.200 --> 35:08.240]  you know it's kind of like in many ways we've got this contest obola and tyranny is the disease
[35:09.040 --> 35:13.760]  just like ebola just like a lot of infectious diseases sometimes they can be stopped in the
[35:13.760 --> 35:20.160]  early stages fairly easily just with cleaning your hands or something but after it gets into you
[35:20.160 --> 35:26.160]  starts reproducing reaches a certain critical mass there's nothing you can do to stop it and so
[35:26.160 --> 35:29.520]  there are some things that we can do and a lot of those are at the local level so we're going to
[35:29.520 --> 35:34.080]  talk about that with someone here in austin who's running for it i think you'll see a lot of parallels
[35:34.080 --> 35:40.640]  to your area but we were just talking in the last section about hillary clinton's new quote that
[35:40.640 --> 35:46.400]  businesses don't create jobs you know we need to get over the idea that businesses are interested
[35:46.400 --> 35:50.960]  in creating jobs and as i said there's a certain element of truth in that that businesses don't
[35:50.960 --> 35:57.520]  set out to create jobs but most of the new job creation comes from small businesses not from
[35:57.520 --> 36:03.680]  from crony capless who are the friends of bill and hillary clinton who are the friends of big g.o.p
[36:04.400 --> 36:10.080]  politicians in washington it's really local businesses that are creating these jobs they're
[36:10.080 --> 36:15.040]  not focused on creating a headcount they're focused on providing a service to their customers and if
[36:15.040 --> 36:19.040]  that's not their primary focus they're not going to be successful but part of that is going to
[36:19.040 --> 36:25.280]  require them hiring people and of course as i said it's small business that hires the jobs and
[36:25.280 --> 36:31.040]  it's small business that really feels the brunt of government regulation the people who are the
[36:31.040 --> 36:36.720]  crony capless who bought influence with bill and hillary clinton or with the bushes those people
[36:36.720 --> 36:42.320]  escape the regulations that the rest of us live under they also escape the scrutiny of the irs or
[36:42.320 --> 36:47.920]  i would say even the abuse of the irs it's not just institutions like tea party groups that are
[36:47.920 --> 36:54.000]  being hit targeted unfairly by the irs of course a lot of that goes on the irs is used to target
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.600]  political enemies if you haven't seen it i would suggest that you go to alex jones's youtube channel
[36:59.600 --> 37:04.400]  and look at the interview that we aired on friday night on the nightly news we talked to someone
[37:04.400 --> 37:09.760]  about the case of george hanson a congressman who wrote a book to harass our people it was
[37:09.760 --> 37:15.920]  about irs abuses he also wrote and got past the taxpayer bill of rights which we still use today
[37:15.920 --> 37:21.600]  he also stopped the irs from taxing the relief money from flood victims in his jurisdiction
[37:21.600 --> 37:28.000]  and because of all that he was targeted by the irs they used dirty tricks for him before the
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.720]  election when that didn't work they came after him with criminal charges that didn't work he
[37:32.720 --> 37:39.280]  actually uh as part of that audit he got money back from them eventually they were able to convict
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.960]  him on some fine details of something that he had already cleared with the house ethics committee
[37:44.960 --> 37:49.040]  he'd gotten there okay with it it was very upfront as to what he was doing and it was
[37:49.040 --> 37:56.080]  selective persecution and i'll say persecution not prosecution because that the same time
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.480]  edmice ronald reagan's attorney general was given a pass for doing the same sort of thing
[38:01.120 --> 38:06.480]  jeldein ferraro the vice presidential running mate of walter mondale who ran against ronald reagan
[38:06.480 --> 38:11.920]  in 1984 was given a free pass for doing the exact same sort of thing but they came after him in the
[38:11.920 --> 38:16.720]  same way they came after dinesh desuza they came after him criminally for what should have been
[38:16.720 --> 38:22.240]  again a civil fine if they were going to do anything at all eventually they got a conviction
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.200]  from him even that conviction was overturned after he fought it for 10 years it was overturned
[38:27.200 --> 38:32.880]  in the supreme court knowing that was going to happen they came after him yet again relentless
[38:32.880 --> 38:39.360]  political persecution but it's not just political persecution they're stealing property from small
[38:39.360 --> 38:44.560]  businessmen listen to this story from the new york times law lets the irs seize accounts on
[38:44.560 --> 38:50.800]  suspicion with no crime required they start out by saying for almost 40 years carol hinders has
[38:50.800 --> 38:56.560]  dished out mexican specialties in her modest cash only restaurant for just as long she deposited
[38:56.560 --> 39:01.920]  the earnings of a small bank branch a block away until last year and she got some irs agents who
[39:01.920 --> 39:07.840]  came and informed her that they had seized her checking account almost 33 000 she would have
[39:07.840 --> 39:14.640]  that kind of money in because of course she has a payroll because she has employees jobs she created
[39:14.640 --> 39:20.800]  they said the money was seized solely because she had deposited less than 10 000 at a time
[39:20.800 --> 39:26.000]  which they viewed as an attempt to avoid triggering a required government report they call that
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.960]  structuring now if you've got a cash business and you're going to accumulate business wouldn't
[39:30.960 --> 39:37.280]  you want to deposit the cash as you're getting it in rather than keeping it under your mattress i mean
[39:37.280 --> 39:42.640]  that's the whole point that you have banks isn't it but i say using a law that's designed to catch
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.680]  drug traffickers racketeers and terrorists by tracking their cash and i would differ with that i
[39:47.680 --> 39:53.280]  would say it's not designed to catch them okay that's not who it's being used at they're not
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.840]  they didn't design the war on drugs to go after the drug dealers because as we learned from
[39:58.480 --> 40:03.040]  gary webbs investigation and many other times it's the government that is involved in that it's the
[40:03.040 --> 40:09.280]  corruption they designed it to give them power to take away our due process our civil liberties
[40:09.280 --> 40:15.520]  this is just one aspect of it the civil asset forfeiture laws that really aren't laws at all
[40:15.520 --> 40:21.680]  because they don't charge you with a crime they don't give you due process they violate the
[40:21.680 --> 40:26.080]  constitution and if they do all of those things they're not legitimate laws but here's some other
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.520]  examples of this to show how bad this has gotten and how rapidly it's ramping up they say the irs
[40:31.520 --> 40:41.840]  made 639 seizures in 2012 up from 114 in 2005 okay so about five to six times the amount in seven
[40:41.840 --> 40:47.280]  years they said the practice has swept up dairy farmers in maryland an army sergeant in virginia
[40:47.280 --> 40:53.360]  saving for his children's college education and the person that we started this with mrs hinders
[40:53.360 --> 41:00.240]  who is 67 it's an amazing thing to see this being done to our citizens and of course as i mentioned
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.880]  you know the government really does create a lot of jobs we're at the point now where if you total
[41:04.880 --> 41:09.920]  up the people who are dependent on the government and you total up the people who work for the
[41:09.920 --> 41:15.520]  government the massive expansion that we've seen of government employees under obama you're getting
[41:15.520 --> 41:20.080]  to the tipping point of it being more than 50 percent maybe it is already 50 percent i don't
[41:20.080 --> 41:26.560]  have the stats in front of me i know it's getting very close just with obama care alone obama added
[41:26.560 --> 41:34.320]  16 000 irs agents and as i mentioned in the last segment many physicians have self-retired or gotten
[41:34.320 --> 41:41.200]  out of the business many people are getting out of producing health care services because of the
[41:41.200 --> 41:46.080]  bureaucracy the harassment of these employees that they're creating i had a friend who was in
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.160]  the military and i had a business at the time and when we got together we're talking about
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.040]  my business he didn't ask me the metrics that you would expect you know what are your gross
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.120]  sales what are what is your profit margin how many stores do you have whatever he asked me how
[41:59.120 --> 42:03.920]  many people i had working for me and i thought that was really kind of a strange question
[42:04.480 --> 42:08.320]  and as i thought about it i thought people who are working for government where there's the
[42:08.320 --> 42:13.520]  military where there's civilian they are looking at how many people they have underneath them
[42:14.080 --> 42:20.080]  as a metric of their success because it's all about how many people you control it's about
[42:20.080 --> 42:25.920]  building an empire and unfortunately that mentality flows out to the entire society
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.480]  because ultimately it doesn't become just about how many people you control in your own little
[42:30.480 --> 42:37.760]  fiefdom it becomes about controlling everyone that is the purpose of our government now is to
[42:37.760 --> 42:43.200]  control us in everything we do that's why they send out the emergency alert systems that's why
[42:43.200 --> 42:49.360]  they want driverless cars so that they can control your communications your transportation

[47:15.920 --> 47:30.720]  um crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcm radio network radio
[47:32.000 --> 47:36.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we've been talking about the war on business
[47:36.800 --> 47:44.320]  about hillary clinton saying that businesses don't create jobs about the irs seizing massive amounts
[47:44.320 --> 47:50.880]  of money from small businesses claiming that they were structuring their deposits not charging them
[47:50.880 --> 47:56.720]  with a crime not giving them due process just seizing the money you know if you've got a small
[47:56.720 --> 48:02.160]  business if you've got a especially if it's a cash business let's say it's a your hot dog vendor
[48:02.160 --> 48:06.560]  are you going to be able to deposit your cash at the end of each day without somebody saying i think
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.440]  you're structuring your deposits to stay under ten thousand dollars so we're going to treat you
[48:11.440 --> 48:17.840]  as if you're a drug dealer a money launder they always use those labels to get their laws passed
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.480]  and then you wind up seeing it used against ordinary people who are not engaged in any
[48:22.480 --> 48:30.400]  criminal activity and taking away the due process that our constitution guarantees it respects our
[48:30.400 --> 48:37.360]  rights as individuals that we have over and above the constitution rights of self-defense rights of
[48:37.360 --> 48:44.560]  free speech rights of privacy and yet they take these things away and ignore the constitution
[48:45.600 --> 48:50.640]  there is no legitimate purpose for the kinds of things that we see being done under the name of
[48:50.640 --> 48:57.440]  the war on drugs that's been going on for decades finally we see some items being run by the mainstream
[48:57.440 --> 49:02.560]  media perhaps they're laying the groundwork for drug legalization because maybe they don't need
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.960]  the war on drugs anymore now they've got the war on terror because they can do exactly the same
[49:06.960 --> 49:14.080]  sorts of things swat teams militarized police denial of civil liberties repossessing or retaking
[49:14.080 --> 49:19.520]  away your possessions without any due process without even charging with the crime they can do
[49:19.520 --> 49:25.120]  all of that and more with the war on terror so now we see that the obama administration
[49:25.120 --> 49:31.760]  is looking at putting someone in a position that's that is advocating legalizing all drugs someone
[49:31.760 --> 49:37.440]  who is formerly with the aclu i would like to see drug prohibition in but drug prohibition just
[49:37.440 --> 49:42.880]  simply ending drug prohibition isn't going to be enough if we allow those abuses of our
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.480]  individual freedoms to stand as we see them being impinged upon at airports and elsewhere if they
[49:48.480 --> 49:55.520]  roll the tsa out all over the streets if they continue with these swat team raids on people for
[49:55.520 --> 50:01.120]  no reason at all as we see it's it's expanded even into areas like the department of education
[50:01.120 --> 50:06.480]  swat teaming a family because someone in the family had an unpaid student loan if we're going to
[50:06.480 --> 50:13.440]  allow that to happen it's not going to do us any good to take away the criminal penalties for drugs
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.080]  and again i'm not advocating the use of drugs anymore than i advocate the use of alcohol we
[50:18.080 --> 50:23.520]  just learned that lesson hopefully in some ways about alcohol prohibition it's the prohibition
[50:23.520 --> 50:28.720]  that is the problem but taking away the prohibition isn't going to restore our civil liberties we can
[50:28.720 --> 50:34.560]  only do that if we get active at the local and state level i think it's perhaps in my opinion
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.880]  maybe it's not too late my opinion i think it is too late to try to do anything much about
[50:38.880 --> 50:45.360]  washington our best protection against the kind of criminals that we've seen take over washington
[50:45.360 --> 50:50.160]  is at the state and federal level we're going to have to elect patriots with a backbone
[50:50.160 --> 50:54.000]  in the next hour we're going to talk to somebody here locally who is someone like that who is someone
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.560]  who has started small businesses who knows that businesses in fact do create jobs and we need
[51:00.560 --> 51:06.640]  people at the local level who are going to push back against this tyranny at the national level
[51:06.640 --> 51:11.440]  we haven't talked about ebola yet today so i want to change directions and go with that for a moment
[51:11.440 --> 51:18.240]  and if you want to call in and talk about ebola or talk about hillary's amazing profession that
[51:18.240 --> 51:27.520]  uh businesses don't create a jobs our number on sundays is 877-789-2539 that's 877-789 alex if you
[51:27.520 --> 51:34.320]  want to chime in on that now we had some amazing revelations that we reported on at info wars.com
[51:34.320 --> 51:41.120]  from the testimony and congressional hearings on friday basically we had a major general and some
[51:41.120 --> 51:46.960]  other individuals from the obama administration go before congress and they were asked questions
[51:46.960 --> 51:53.440]  about the troop deployment that is going to be taking place in liberia one of the most intense
[51:53.440 --> 51:58.400]  areas of the ebola outbreak in western africa many of us have questioned from the very beginning
[51:58.400 --> 52:05.280]  why it is necessary to send the 101st airborne division into that area we've been told that it's
[52:05.280 --> 52:12.000]  to build medical facilities to train people but of course as dr france's boil pointed out several
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.840]  times on our shows with interviews this last week the 101st airborne is not known for being a medical
[52:17.840 --> 52:26.000]  unit dr boil is known for being a bio weapons expert and he's pointed out that we have a lot
[52:26.000 --> 52:32.480]  of research facilities in that area and he's pointed out that under treaties that he wrote back
[52:32.480 --> 52:37.920]  in the 1970s and 80s that were enacted with criminal penalties for doing the kinds of research
[52:37.920 --> 52:43.200]  in many cases that these bio weapons labs are doing in western africa he said they put them there
[52:43.200 --> 52:48.880]  so that they could evade monitoring that they would get here in america so we see a lot of
[52:49.600 --> 52:53.280]  we see the cdc involved there we see the us military involved in these areas where the
[52:53.280 --> 53:00.000]  outbreak was we see tulane university involved there it was interesting to me to hear npr do a
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.080]  story friday night as we learned that another medical person had come down with the ebola
[53:06.080 --> 53:12.240]  they talked to someone from tulane university now of course tulane is where they had the famous
[53:12.240 --> 53:18.720]  tuskegee syphilis experiments where they did experiments on people without their informed
[53:18.720 --> 53:22.960]  consent told them they were being treated for diseases when in fact they were not giving them
[53:22.960 --> 53:28.640]  any treatment they just wanted to use black people as guinea pigs and they did it for decades there
[53:28.640 --> 53:35.200]  that was tulane university now also at the center of our bio weapons research and of course this guy
[53:35.200 --> 53:41.120]  from tulane was telling npr that with proper care he thought that uh we could get the number of people
[53:41.120 --> 53:48.160]  who died from 80 down to 20 as long as we made sure they had fluids and that was replaced he
[53:48.160 --> 53:54.560]  didn't have any basis for that number he just gave that as a ballpark figure uh there's a lot of
[53:54.560 --> 53:59.040]  crazy things that are coming out but this what we had on friday during the day the congressional
[53:59.040 --> 54:05.040]  testimony we had a lot of interesting admissions the first one that came out was the do d admitting
[54:05.040 --> 54:11.040]  that they only have one plane available to transport infected soldiers out of africa here's that
[54:11.600 --> 54:17.120]  testimony before congress how many patients can that aircraft hold we're told what our craft can
[54:17.120 --> 54:21.520]  the aircraft can hold one at a time and can do four movements a week at this point four movements
[54:21.520 --> 54:28.960]  a week yes sir um is that sufficient given the number of uh a bowl of patients that the united
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.520]  states has had in total at the present time it is sufficient however but that's not how these
[54:33.520 --> 54:38.240]  epidemics work right and so at this time the department of defense has an urgent
[54:38.240 --> 54:43.440]  unstatement that's being worked through the system with transcom to put together a uh
[54:44.640 --> 54:50.320]  isolation pod that can carry multiple persons for c-17 aircraft testing will begin in october
[54:50.320 --> 54:57.120]  or i'm sorry uh development will begin in october is uh testing in december let me come back in
[54:57.120 --> 55:03.040]  here so what he's saying is that they've got one plane that can transmit one person at a time with
[55:03.040 --> 55:09.600]  symptoms and that plane can make four trips a week so they're going to send five thousand troops
[55:09.600 --> 55:16.240]  into the heart of the ebola outbreak and they're going to be able to bring back as at most four
[55:16.240 --> 55:22.080]  per week now that was uh representative mckinry from north carolina he says uh so really that's
[55:22.080 --> 55:26.400]  all that you can bring back and the major general says well if they're symptomatic yeah they says
[55:26.960 --> 55:30.960]  then representative mckinry says so this is not at all sufficient and then the major general says
[55:30.960 --> 55:37.120]  well we don't know if it's sufficient and then mckinry says this is very disconcerting
[55:37.120 --> 55:41.440]  yes it is very disconcerting it's also very disconcerting to see that they're shipped over
[55:41.440 --> 55:50.080]  there with only four hours of training and with only gloves and a mask that's not a sufficient
[55:50.080 --> 55:55.440]  mask that's what we were told at the beginning of the week then they modified their story somewhat
[55:55.440 --> 56:00.560]  and first they said that's all they really need because they're not going to be exposed to anyone
[56:00.560 --> 56:05.440]  when they're over there we learned in the testimony on friday that they're going to be bringing in
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.520]  500 medical professionals that are working in the west uh africa area working with ebola patients
[56:11.520 --> 56:17.760]  they're going to be bringing 500 of them in a week for training that's going to be a lot of exposure
[56:17.760 --> 56:24.160]  to people who are on the front lines with ebola patients now we hear that they are going to
[56:24.160 --> 56:30.480]  issue them tyvek suits once they get in country but we were told that they didn't need those suits
[56:30.480 --> 56:35.920]  because they weren't going to be exposed listen to what came out on friday in congressional
[56:35.920 --> 56:42.000]  testimony again this is the same major general he was being asked why they're only going to hold
[56:42.000 --> 56:48.720]  soldiers under a 10-day quarantine when 21 days is what we've been told and listen to what he says
[56:48.720 --> 56:57.120]  is the reason so general why do we only hold our our troops for 10 days before we release them to
[56:57.120 --> 57:03.120]  bring them back to the united states yes sir thanks for the question and and i can understand the
[57:03.120 --> 57:12.640]  confusion on this but let me let me let me see if i can make it clear for to start the 21 day period
[57:12.640 --> 57:19.120]  for monitoring has to take place outside the infection zone uh for us that'll be in the united
[57:19.120 --> 57:26.080]  states out of an abundance of caution um prior to departure in order to reduce their risk commanders
[57:26.080 --> 57:32.640]  will be allowed to remove their personnel from whatever jobs they were doing for up to 10 days
[57:33.600 --> 57:42.480]  prior to departure from liberia in case uh to just to limit their exposure and what he's saying is
[57:42.480 --> 57:47.760]  that we have that full clip after we come back he says the entire country is an infection zone
[57:47.760 --> 57:52.880]  for purposes of quarantine stay with us we'll be right back the government's department of homeland
[57:52.880 --> 57:58.080]  security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time the restricting civilians rights to own and

[1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:12.400]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:19.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show on david night your host today we were talking in the
[1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:25.280]  last segment about the congressional hearings on friday on ebola they were asking about the
[1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:31.200]  deployment of us troops in order to quote unquote fight ebola in liberia and we had some
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:36.640]  interesting admissions come out of this in terms of what they're doing or have not done to look
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:41.280]  after the health of the soldiers who are going after that going over there we learned that they
[1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:46.240]  only have one plane that can bring someone back who is symptomatic in other words keep them in
[1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:53.520]  isolation that plane can only carry one person at a time and can only make four trips per week so
[1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:58.800]  they can bring a total of four people back per week that are symptomatic from this area
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:05.840]  and that's it out of five thousand troops that they're sending over there and then we learned
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:09.520]  this from the major general i want to play this full clip we didn't have time for it in the last
[1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:15.040]  segment just before the top of the hour let's go back to that clip and play this he has amazing
[1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:23.680]  admission about how they look at liberia so general why do we only hold our our troops
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:29.280]  for 10 days before we release them to bring them back to the united states yes sir thanks for the
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:35.440]  question and and i can understand the confusion on this for let me let me uh let me see if i can
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:44.320]  make it clear for to start the 21 day period for monitoring has to take place outside the
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:52.000]  infection zone for us that'll be in the united states out of an abundance of caution prior
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:57.200]  to departure in order to reduce their risk commanders will be allowed to remove their
[1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:04.400]  personnel from whatever jobs they were doing for up to 10 days prior to departure from liberia
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:13.120]  in case uh just to limit their exposure and provide a struggling explain why they're only
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:17.040]  going to keep them for 10 out of the 21 days i need to be isolated i'm going to need further
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:22.480]  explanation of this because i i don't understand the 10 days when the science has the 21 days but
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:27.280]  but the 21 days takes place well the 21 day monitoring for us military personnel will take
[1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:33.200]  place stateside after they've left uh in order to ensure that they are Ebola free just like
[1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:39.280]  just as was described previously for other health care workers why can't you quarantine
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:44.400]  in the country of of of infection particularly if we're sending over military that could build a
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:50.480]  quarantine unit ma'am i'll defer to the doctors here we go listen to this disease uh personnel
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:55.200]  tell us in order to be absolutely certain that everybody is Ebola free it has to be outside
[1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:59.680]  the infection zone and for all intents and purposes the entire country of liberia is an
[1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:04.960]  infection zone there we go for all intents and purposes the entire country of liberia is an
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:09.600]  infection zone remember when we were told last week that they were only going to give limited
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:13.440]  protective equipment to the soldiers who were going over there they only gave them four hours of
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:19.200]  training they're only needed limited protection equipment like gloves and a mask not a suit
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:23.440]  because they were not going to be exposed to Ebola yet for purposes of quarantine
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:30.640]  they believe that the entire country is an infection zone now i find it interesting as the
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:34.560]  congress lady there was uh pointing out i think it was maloney from new york she was a democrat
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:39.600]  that's both democrats and republicans asking these hard questions why if we're being told by the cdc
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:44.640]  that it is 21 days would you only hold them for 10 and and let's understand too the science of this
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:50.400]  that doesn't mean that people are 100 safe after 21 days it means that there's a 95 percent chance
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:55.200]  that you're not going to get it transmitted after that if you go all the way out to 42 days and it
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:01.040]  goes down to 98 percent it's still not a hundred percent so let's understand that these are measures
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:06.960]  of risk they're not absolute it's safe or it's not safe it's not a binary function here it is
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:11.760]  how much of a risk do we willing to live with they're willing to take a five percent chance
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:14.960]  that this is going to spread but they're not even doing that they're bringing people back they're
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:20.080]  going to bring people back put all these military personnel after quarantining there for 10 days
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:27.520]  they're going to bring them back in a small plane together after 10 days and we've seen that after
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:33.520]  about 10 to 14 days that's when people who have been exposed to it typically come down with it so
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:39.440]  that process of not holding them in country for quarantine but putting them on a plane for 30
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:44.800]  some odd hours and shipping them back stateside that is even more dangerous but they were telling
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:48.880]  us it wasn't a problem because they were going to be isolated yet now we learned that they consider
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:53.040]  the entire country to be an infection zone say with us we're going to be right back with a couple
[1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:58.720]  of your calls and with a local candidate who's going to talk about politics being local in your
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:02.720]  area as well stay with us we'll be right back using unparalleled research in the development
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:08.560]  of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation the next level

[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:19.600]  through info wars life was invented during doctor group's research on the toxification of our bodies
[1:05:19.600 --> 1:05:24.960]  many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:31.040]  ingredients oftentimes full of synthetic fillers gmo's additives or worse gently start cleaning

[1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:45.680]  the republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns
[1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:55.120]  i have sworn upon the author of god internal hostility against every form of tyranny over the
[1:06:55.120 --> 1:07:07.440]  mind of man the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:13.200]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host today we were just talking
[1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:19.280]  about congressional testimony on friday but we saw a major general as well as some civilians
[1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:24.480]  it was only one doctor on the panel that could be asked questions by the congressional committee
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:31.600]  we don't seem to be interested in having doctors in charge of this but they were primarily focused
[1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:37.200]  on the risks to the soldiers what was being done to protect them and really what was the mission
[1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:42.240]  now what we learned not too many people have talked about this we had a story on friday
[1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:47.600]  on info wars dot com that they only have one plane that can take one person that is symptomatic at a
[1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:53.520]  time and that plane can make four journeys a week so they can get four people four soldiers out of
[1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:58.880]  the 5000 that they're sending over there back a week per week now we've been told don't worry
[1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:02.320]  they're not going to be in contact with anybody yet we also learned that they're going to be bringing
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:09.600]  in 500 medical workers per week from the african countries there that are on the front lines of
[1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:14.960]  the abola outbreak they're going to be bringing them in to train them we also learned in this last
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:20.400]  clip that we played in the last section the major general said that they are only going to hold the
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:27.520]  soldiers in quarantine in that country for 10 days and the congress people were amazed at that why
[1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:31.440]  not the 21 days we keep hearing that you're going to quarantine people for 21 days so he says well
[1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:37.920]  we'll do some quarantine with them back stateside but we can't do the full quarantine in country
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:44.480]  because for all practical purposes liberia the entire country is an infection zone there you go
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:49.440]  so the entire country is an infection zone yet they're sending the soldiers over there soldiers
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:55.520]  who in many cases are not specialists in medicine we're sending the 101st airborne division over
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:09:00.800]  there as dr frances boil who is an expert on bioterrorism pointed out and he also knows a lot
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:06.640]  about what the cia and other agencies have been doing with bio weapons he pointed out these are
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:13.040]  not the divisions that we see as medical divisions or building divisions there are a lot of elite
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:17.760]  fighting units that are going over there for what purpose well we know that the Bilderberg group
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:24.160]  in 2013 pointed out that africa was one of their areas of special interest we know that african
[1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:32.080]  was created back in 2007 fairly recently are they looking to get at natural resources in africa
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:38.080]  are they looking to get a pandemic going across the world so they can sell us vaccines it's been
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:44.480]  reported by the WHO we have this up on info wars.com today that the ebola cases have now gone past
[1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:50.480]  10 000 worldwide this is from the WHO the world health organization now to put that in perspective
[1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:56.880]  that is more than four times the number of all the previous ebola outbreaks there's been about 32
[1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:04.880]  of them all of them combined in total are less than 2,500 so this is more than four times that
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:10.320]  already we were told at the beginning of the outbreak that it was a different strain of ebola
[1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:14.400]  that's something that hasn't been talked about a great deal and so we keep hearing the same
[1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:20.000]  pronouncements that this is we understand the science we know everything about this you just
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:28.480]  need to trust us we know how this is spread and yet this is still accelerating it is still now it
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:35.920]  is across the 10 000 mark we have up on info wars.com a quote from the army times from patricia
[1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:41.040]  kime it says viruses like ebola have been of interest to the pentagon since the late 1970s
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:48.560]  mainly because ebola and its fellow viruses have high mortality rates and its stable nature in aerosol
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:55.520]  it's stable nature in aerosol make it attractive as a potential biological weapon
[1:10:56.160 --> 1:11:01.360]  i want to take a couple of your calls before we go to a guest we have a businessman a gunshot
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:08.000]  owner someone who's going to talk to us about how the elites understand that all politics are local
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:13.760]  but many of us who are concerned about liberty haven't gotten that message yet michael cargill
[1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:17.360]  is going to be on with us later in the hour before we do i want to take a few of your
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:20.160]  phone calls let's go to uh mary in wisconsin mary
[1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:28.320]  hello yes go ahead yes day tonight uh you and alex jones are doing a tremendous job with
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:32.800]  your team at info wars getting the truth out about the acquired diseases that are actually created
[1:11:32.800 --> 1:11:37.200]  in labs but the most important news that you can share and i know alex knows this and i know you
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:43.120]  know this is that yeah wages prices in australia brian lender go lightly marshal his last site on
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:49.600]  you to the sort of truth three one six eight and also on google god is in the world right now australia
[1:11:49.600 --> 1:11:55.520]  in australia and we all is angel incarnate and angels in heaven realm and the same work together
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:12:01.200]  to reveal the truth and to uncover the evil that's truly happening by the state well i think that
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:06.000]  yeah i do i i do believe that god is in the world right now i don't think that he is incarnate but
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:09.120]  that's an interesting idea thank you so much you told us you're gonna have something to talk about
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:17.600]  ebola uh let's go to andrew and illinois andrew yeah great great great show and uh i got my

[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:53.520]  the fall and then i'd go it will be airborne you know yes that's something else that's come out that
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:58.080]  it it does have the capacity to go airborne something another thing that came out during
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:02.400]  these congressional testimonies that i did not mention was the fact that they begrudgingly
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:09.840]  got the doctor to admit that yes ebola can be spread by someone touching a surface and and the
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:13.600]  virus staying on that surface and someone else touching that surface as a matter of fact
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:18.320]  nancy right ball the second person who came back remember the first two that came back and went to
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:24.960]  emory university who's kent bradley and uh nancy right ball uh she said she had no idea how she
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:29.120]  contracted it she said there was no breach of her protective equipment the same thing that the doctor
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:34.560]  who's currently getting treatment in new york said she believed however that it might have been
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:39.040]  that a co-worker who she did not have any direct physical contact with she was sure about that
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:44.400]  came down with ebola and she thought that she might have touched uh something that he touched
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:50.080]  and so that is a very important part of the training that of course the u.s military uh
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:53.440]  i don't know if they're getting time for that or not they're only getting four hours of training
[1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:58.160]  before they go over there but the most important thing about your protective equipment is knowing
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.520]  how to take it off without contaminating yourself because you can contaminate yourself with your own
[1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:08.800]  a protective equipment but there's also been the issue where obama said that you couldn't get it
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:16.160]  on a bus and then we had at a press conference someone asked the director of the cdc freeden
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:20.400]  can you get it on a bus or not and he gave us the answer he said well you can't get it on a bus
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:27.200]  but we don't want people to have ebola writing on it on a bus because they can give it you understand
[1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:32.480]  it so you can't get it on a bus according to freeden but uh you know don't get on a bus because
[1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:38.000]  you could give it to somebody else well they were able on uh friday to get an admission from the
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:45.520]  people there that begrudgingly that yes in fact you could transmit it independently uh let's go
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:54.560]  to uh chris in indiana chris hi david hey how you doing what you want to talk about oh i'm doing
[1:14:54.560 --> 1:14:59.440]  all right uh you know we're all being trained you know the first was 9 11 then came the body
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:04.320]  scanners then the vaccines then the checkpoints and then the martial law via the boston bombing and
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:10.240]  now i think it's all come down to all gayly and dialectic problem reaction solution and
[1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:16.640]  but this olabola thing i think it really is coming through that i mean just think about it if there
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:22.000]  is a real outbreak i mean after this new victim in new york city and who knows he's going bowling
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:29.440]  everywhere restaurants subways everything taxis if it really came down to it it might affect the economy
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:34.000]  very much so and then and i think that's what they're more concerned about than people getting sick
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.560]  they're concerned about the uh economic fallout they're concerned about the political fallout
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:42.640]  about this i think you're going to see i think a lot of this stuff is being suppressed and of
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:48.480]  course we had the doctor who called us and talked about how he had been told that people were being
[1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:52.480]  disappeared we've had that from several different sources i think they're trying to keep this under
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:56.720]  wraps before the election and then it's going to be katie bar the door we're going to find out about
[1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:02.560]  that but especially about obama's open borders policy stay with us we'll be right back info wars

[1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:45.840]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night on this sunday october the 26 2014
[1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:51.600]  be joined here in studio with someone who is running for local office now why would we put
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:58.640]  that on a national actually an international radio show well because it's important to have a check
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:03.840]  against unlawful power at every level that's the way our government was initially set up
[1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:09.120]  our founders not only put restrictions on the central government but they also put checks
[1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:12.560]  within the central government against the different branches also checks against the
[1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:19.680]  central government's power at the state and the local level and yet we are constantly focused
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:24.960]  by the mainstream media by the political parties only on the highest level offices
[1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:31.120]  we have a lot of power that is not being used at the state and local level and as we're looking
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:38.000]  at this ebola outbreak we have to wonder what is being hidden before the election we know that
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:45.040]  democrats are running fast away from obama away from harry reid away from nancy polosi they don't
[1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:51.200]  want to be seen with the people who personify the agenda that is behind the failure of the
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:57.200]  obama administration behind the anti-freedom anti-prosperity open borders agenda that they
[1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:04.000]  represent they're running from them and yet it really is the agenda look at ebola for example
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:11.200]  as we pointed out last week we had a brave whistleblower dr james lorenzi a physician call us and
[1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:20.320]  tell us about people that he had firsthand knowledge of that had been uh basically disappeared
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:25.120]  once they had ebola also in the hospital system where that was not in the hospital system where
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:30.240]  he was but in the hospital system where he was they were removing protective equipment remember
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:36.240]  that it wasn't just that mr duncan who had ebola the librarian who came to dallas that had ebola
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:41.600]  it wasn't just that he was sent away from the emergency room for two days that was the biggest
[1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:45.840]  outrage i think just as outrageous was the fact that when he came back two days later and they
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:51.600]  realized that he did have ebola they quarantined him and separated him they didn't give the nursing
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:56.400]  staff protective equipment why would they do that i think perhaps for the same reason that
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:01.600]  they're now confiscating protective equipment they don't want people being seen walking around in
[1:23:01.600 --> 1:23:07.360]  hazmat suits they don't want to panic people we see the essay from the wall street journal the
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:12.400]  anti hysteria hysteria saying that the only thing that they're getting hysterical about is the fact
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:18.000]  that they don't want people to get afraid of this and yet we need to understand what the risks are
[1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:24.640]  and there are risks out there it's not totally safe and it isn't like the previous ebola outbreaks
[1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:29.360]  but this is something that they're deliberately trying to keep under the radar we've had not
[1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:34.720]  only that doctor relate to us what he's heard from other doctors about ebola patients being
[1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:40.800]  disappeared we have had other doctors tell that to us off the record he was brave enough to come
[1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:45.920]  on the record and say that we also know that in the new york fire department they have been given
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:51.840]  a bulletin saying not to use the word ebola on the radio so they want to keep that quiet they
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:58.800]  want to keep the consequences of our open borders quiet as well they don't want that to be an issue
[1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:03.120]  that people are thinking about the crime associated with it one of the things I want to talk to
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:07.760]  Mike Cargill about is this shooting that just happened over the weekend with the two sheriff
[1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:13.440]  deputies that were shot the guy who did that had been deported twice was an illegal alien who
[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:19.760]  was deported twice and yet we're not supposed to have any control over who comes to live in our
[1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:24.000]  country we're not allowed to look at their criminal background to vet them we're not allowed to look
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:29.680]  at their medical history to vet them for that we're just supposed to allow anyone who comes into
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:35.200]  this country into this country and of course the open borders that is part of why they are
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:41.200]  downplaying the ebola risk that is something that right after the election when obama is a lame
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:47.040]  duck president that is when you're really going to see him cut loose with the open borders immigration
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:51.600]  and that's when we're really going to find out what the state of the current of ebola in this
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:58.080]  country currently is now as an introduction to what's going on in the austin area something that's
[1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:03.280]  very similar to what's going on in your area remember that it was just earlier this year
[1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:10.160]  that the sheriff in milwaukee david clark who had come out very strongly for people's rights to
[1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:15.760]  defend themselves and protect themselves being very honest with his constituents saying we can't
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:20.560]  always be there when something happens we can get there eventually but initially of course you're
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:24.960]  going to be on your own when somebody kicks in the door breaks into your home you need to protect
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:31.280]  yourself you need to get firearms you need to learn how to use them and for that he was targeted
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:40.080]  by michael bloomberg 150 000 against him and over 500 000 a spin in that race just a local
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:44.560]  sheriff's office race now of course bill gates understands that as well he's put a million
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:50.080]  dollars into a fund specifically to attack second amendment rights in washington state
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:57.200]  and he's had a lot of microsoft billionaires join him with massive contributions in washington state
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:03.680]  they understand that where they're really going to take this down is at the local level where people
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:10.080]  don't have a lot of interest and a lot of resources to fight what they're doing now fortunately in
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:15.680]  milwaukee david clark did win he made the point of saying that the election could not be bought
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:22.400]  and so it kind of backfired on michael bloomberg but we have people in austin as well as people
[1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:28.480]  wherever you live there are politicians who want to get on the bandwagon of banning all firearms
[1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:35.520]  and remember this is about uh i guess maybe about a year ago or so this happened uh at a uh an anti
[1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:46.880]  gun rally that was being done at the state capitol here's jacari jackson's report to give you a context
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:51.120]  michael cargill during the break they were telling me about it
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:55.200]  the lone central texas gunworks is a great guy right it's been a frequent guest here
[1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:01.440]  they just told me he's going to run against mike martinus mayor proteam in austin texas
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:10.240]  who's running for mayor and is the heir apparent to lee leppingwell the literal demon but martinus
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:17.440]  is even worse and i'll be brief first of all to the gentleman's dying for attention uh someone
[1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:24.000]  needs to inform him that there is no gunband currently but because of the work that we're doing
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:32.560]  here today we will make your side legitimate shortly so just talk about these mayors all over
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:39.600]  the country like mike martinus the the mayor proteam who says we will ban your guns once we
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:46.080]  get him registered and he works for bloomberg openly heads that up for in texas imagine
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:50.880]  the yuppies listening to me right now in the so-called trendies in people do you morons really
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:56.240]  want to be like chicago with a crime rate the highest in the world because they've taken the guns
[1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:01.440]  do you really want to try to confiscate my guns you're like oh we're not going to do that come on
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:08.080]  alex nobody's trying to take your toys they haven't they haven't taken the guns assault weapons
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:16.960]  van assault weapons they're not says right here that's all semi-honor nobody wants your guns nobody
[1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:23.760]  wants my guns in new york in dc in chicago everywhere you people get in control you ban them
[1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:30.000]  councilman martinus needs to focus his attention on relieving traffic off of i-35 and keep his hands
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:35.920]  off for our second member rights there you go that's the way you beat him isn't it that's absolutely
[1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:40.720]  all politics is ultimately local and we haven't really understood that very well in the liberty
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:45.680]  movement have we no sir we have not and i'm glad you brought up the abola situation because like the
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:51.840]  cdc uh what they should have done in that incident there they should have actually sent a team from
[1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:57.120]  atlanta to that hospital to handle that situation absolutely we're going to be right back with
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:01.440]  mike cargill we're going to talk about how politics is local stay with us we'll be right back
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:06.160]  another major health threat this one in teledo ohio where everybody in the entire city has been
[1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:10.960]  told not to drink the water ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency did you know
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:17.920]  that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day if there's a
[1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:23.440]  water emergency will you be prepared panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day
[1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:28.800]  we're here at a supermarket in teledo you can see the shelves empty where water once was to stay
[1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:35.040]  safe and healthy during a crisis you must have access to safe clean water water which will not

[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:09.040]  keep your immune system and your body in tip top shape well michael we're talking about
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:17.920]  the movement that we've seen from bloomberg and from bill gates at a national level these are guys
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:23.840]  who have a national agenda but they understand that in order to get their gun control agenda for
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:31.600]  example enacted they're going to have to affect local races so they're pouring a lot of money into
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:38.800]  local races even against pro-gun democrats if you look at the spending that michael bloomberg's
[1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:44.800]  independence usa pack has put in he's put in out of about five million dollars he's put in
[1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:52.240]  27 percent of that has been against democrats who support gun ownership he's put in 41 percent of
[1:35:52.240 --> 1:35:58.000]  it in favor of republicans who are against our second amendment rights so it can run the other
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:02.640]  way so when you look at that the bulk of the money that he's putting in almost 70 percent
[1:36:02.640 --> 1:36:08.160]  is for pro-gun democrats and anti-gun republicans absolutely they're doing this all around the
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:13.360]  country they're not doing this in texas they're doing it everywhere bloomberg has actually
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:18.240]  come out and he said hey i have millions and i'm going to spend those millions to affect
[1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:23.360]  you know the different elections around the country new york you know they want to bring
[1:36:23.360 --> 1:36:28.320]  all those ideas they have in new york you know to your state and your neighborhood but we're
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.480]  trying to push back and we're saying no we're going to fight we don't have that kind of money
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:36.880]  but we're going to fight and stand up because this is something that you know all of the
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:41.840]  the leaders or local leaders down on that ballot believe in and we tried to encourage people you
[1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:46.560]  know when those big elections come around that governor's race that presidential race uh please
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:50.560]  go all the way down the ballot in support the people that are on the bottom of the ballot
[1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:55.520]  that's right you know you have like for instance your your county sheriff uh that person's very
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:59.760]  important that person's going to be the first person that's going to stand in front of you and
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:04.160]  say hey when the feds come and knocking they can actually stop it and kick them out of the county
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:08.640]  and we've seen that in california where you know you have your different sheriffs stand up and say
[1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:13.840]  hey i want the fbi out of my county i'm going to handle this my way absolutely it's happened here
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:19.040]  in texas as well and we saw that happen in milwaukee sheriff dav clark that's why bloomberg
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:25.280]  targeted him targeted him with 150 000 dollars that he spent against david clark it was a half
[1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:29.840]  million dollars in that local sheriff primary course there wasn't any republican running so
[1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:35.360]  that really was the election but still a half a million dollars and that was outside money being
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:40.480]  spent against him he won he said you're not going to be able to buy this election but he had a very
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:44.320]  loyal constituency i think because he had been honest with him he had told him look we're going
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:48.320]  to do everything we can to protect you we're going to come after these guys after the fact but while
[1:37:48.320 --> 1:37:55.920]  it's going on a cop can't be everywhere they can't be at your door when your door gets kicked in by
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:02.560]  a home invasion so it's important he said to be armed as well as to understand how to safely use
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:06.400]  a firearm that's something that you do in your business you not only sell firearms but you also
[1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:10.480]  do training absolutely we do a lot of training we teach people how to draw that firearm when they
[1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:16.320]  need to uh law enforcement is not going to always be there and on different little situations we've
[1:38:16.320 --> 1:38:22.400]  seen around the country we've seen it takes you know law enforcement anywhere from 12 to 15 minutes
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:26.880]  to arrive on the scene after the first shots are fired so you know who's going to be that person
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:30.960]  that's going to help you and save you get you out of that building out of that room or out of that
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:36.160]  situation that's going to be yourself and law enforcement cannot be everywhere but they can
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:41.680]  be an effective backstop against federal intrusions as you pointed out with a sheriff especially
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:46.480]  but it goes for a lot of the different offices as the liberals know we've heard from them over
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:52.400]  and over again thank globally act locally in other words they have a global agenda they have a
[1:38:52.400 --> 1:38:57.760]  national agenda whether it's gun control or whether it's some other aspects they have that agenda
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:03.200]  that they've created they're using the same tactic all over the country and yet they know
[1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:08.160]  that it's going to have to be implemented at the local level but unfortunately so often we
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:13.440]  put all of our attention on just the highest level offices like you mentioned before for governor or
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:17.600]  for president i remember when i was involved with a libertarian party back in north carolina
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:22.480]  in order to get ballot access and to retain that we had to get a fairly high percentage i think it
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:28.960]  was 10 of the vote for president or for governor now that's almost impossible to do but it makes
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:35.520]  you focus all your resources on that high profile race rather than looking downstream to see what
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:41.520]  else is going because when you get someone in who performs an effective backstop against invasions
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:46.880]  of your personal liberties that person can also do other things locally that are going to help
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:52.240]  your quality of life absolutely and we've seen a lot of times where some of those elections down
[1:39:52.240 --> 1:39:58.080]  on the bottom of the ballot takes you know three or four votes for that election is decided there's
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:03.200]  a state representative that was elected to office by difference of four votes you know and you're
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:07.440]  talking one household could have made a difference in that election and some people don't go all the
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:12.960]  way down they don't continue on in your city council races a lot of that stuff is non-partisan
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:18.480]  so people go out in a they hit that that one button i'm going to vote straight democrat i'm
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:22.800]  going to vote straight republican they don't pick and choose you know and and look at the individual
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:28.080]  i encourage people to look at the individuals and vote for the person not for the party and
[1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:33.520]  that's very important as as we saw in jacar as report a little over a year ago when we had
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:39.920]  mike martinez at that uh gun control rally somebody was holding a stop the gun ban he says
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:43.600]  we're not going to do that but hang on to that sign because we're going to make your sign come
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:48.960]  true in other words we are going to ban guns that was an amazing admission and here's this from a
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:54.960]  guy who's just a town councilman but he has a lot of power to help make that happen and now he's
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:41:00.400]  moving to the next level he's moving to the level of running for mayor of austin and so that's why
[1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:05.600]  we need to get people who respect individual liberty in at the local level and one of the
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:10.640]  things that you mentioned when you spoke against that at the at the time which you said uh he needs
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:14.560]  understand these are fundamental rights we have in the constitution and he needs to pay attention
[1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:19.440]  to the traffic flow area in this area exactly because traffic is our main problem here yeah
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:23.920]  but you know your city council members and and those people in those positions are going to be
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:28.800]  the ones that make that decision when something happens on the national level something happens
[1:41:28.800 --> 1:41:34.080]  on that national level when they're going to come down and they're going to say okay well we need to
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:40.000]  now uh confine everyone into this area do these things or do this or do that they're going to
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:44.720]  those people are going to be the key people to make those decisions because it's going to be done
[1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:49.680]  in an incremental regulatory way in other words you know we have these fundamental rights but
[1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:54.560]  they're always looking for ways to turn them into privileges that they can then use to infringe and
[1:41:54.560 --> 1:41:58.800]  that's why the second amendment said you won't infringe on this they knew that it was going to
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:05.600]  be a gradual process of taking away our rights by taking the moving the boundaries in on the edges
[1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:09.120]  and that's essentially what it is with these infringements that they're doing and the way they
[1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:14.240]  enact that is at the local level right and and i always remind people that if you you know one
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:20.240]  thing you need to remember if you you know i i hope those chains risk lightly on your risk if you
[1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:24.960]  do not come out to vote yes yes absolutely we're talking to michael cargill who's running for town
[1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:31.200]  council here in austin but again this is something that is going to affect you wherever you are
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:36.480]  many times you've got about a week or so before the final election deadline you need to look at
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:41.200]  your ballot and look down the ballot and see what these people stand for that are going to be your
[1:42:41.200 --> 1:42:46.480]  town councilman your mayors because that's where you're going to see a lot of infringement on your

[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:06.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:11.360 --> 1:47:16.480]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:26.240]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night joined in studio with michael cargill
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:32.480]  you're out of austin he is actually running for city council but we're highlighting the idea
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:37.680]  that you need to be involved locally you need to understand what your local candidates are doing
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:41.440]  not just what's going on with the governor's race or with the presidential race or with a
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:47.120]  congressional race because some of your most effective bulwarks against tyranny are going to
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:53.840]  be at the local level as we mentioned earlier it was a sheriff's race that bloomberg got involved
[1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:59.360]  in trying to shut down a pro second amendment sheriff david clark and milwaukee spent a
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:03.520]  hundred and fifty thousand dollars that race was incredibly expensive for a sheriff's race
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:07.760]  a half a million dollars of outside money being spent but of course bloomberg's pack
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:13.280]  has focused primarily on congressional races if we look at some of the things that they've
[1:48:13.280 --> 1:48:18.880]  done they spent 3.3 million dollars to help a democratic challenger gloria mcleod upset a
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:26.560]  longtime democrat joe baca in california's 35th congressional district 3.3 million dollars he
[1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:32.320]  can just come in as he did in a couple of years ago 15 million dollars that he pulled in just in
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:38.080]  the last couple of weeks because this guy has billions of dollars and of course we see bill
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.920]  gates doing the same thing in washington state right now there have a anti gun control amendment
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:50.400]  there that's going on but a lot of this is being targeted towards democrats who are pro gun and
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:55.120]  supporting republicans who are anti second amendment that's one of the things that i found
[1:48:55.120 --> 1:49:02.800]  interesting about this mic oh yeah oh yeah and you know it's the city council and also you know
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:08.320]  those people that lower ballot there uh what we try to do is we try to support small businesses
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:13.360]  you have a lot of different companies like uber and lyft that are trying to get off the ground
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:18.960]  and you have you know the people that are in the city and the county level that actually are slowing
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:23.760]  that that progress down and those people are the ones that you know are going to you know make a
[1:49:23.760 --> 1:49:29.040]  change make a difference we need to support small businesses and that's going to make the city your
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:34.240]  city your county it's going to make it grow it's going to provide jobs for you let's let's play
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:38.320]  this quote from hillary clinton i want to get your reaction to this where she said that businesses
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:51.680]  don't create jobs you know it's corporations and businesses that create jobs you know that old theory
[1:49:51.680 --> 1:50:01.680]  trickle down economics that has been tried that has failed i think the problem is is that they
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:06.800]  they didn't trickle enough on us right they most of most of her friends keep all the money they don't
[1:50:06.800 --> 1:50:12.400]  even trickle on us right i started my business out of my uh out of my living room yeah i didn't
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.560]  need anyone else anyone else's help i didn't need any assistance or anything like that started it
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:22.080]  from scratch from zero zilch and build it up to the the business that it is now and your goal was
[1:50:22.080 --> 1:50:27.120]  not to create jobs but it turned out to be what you had to do in order to grow your business you
[1:50:27.120 --> 1:50:30.640]  had to create jobs correct right you know what you're trying to do is you're trying to create a
[1:50:30.640 --> 1:50:36.400]  product you're trying to create a service you're putting your hard earned money in as well as your
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:41.200]  labor to build it but we hear from hillary clinton the same thing that we hear from barack obama
[1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:46.160]  that you didn't build this that that businesses don't create jobs and what some of them can do is
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:51.600]  they can prevent people from creating jobs they can prevent you know expansion yes so we need to get
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:56.720]  people in there that won't you know remove some of those roadblocks yes remove some of the uh the
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:02.720]  structure trying to prevent people from actually getting permits and things of that nature and so
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:07.520]  we need to you know kind of help our small business people and and that way they can grow and flourish
[1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:13.360]  absolutely basically government is there as an inhibitor of job creation and so what they can
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:17.840]  do is they can basically get out of the way to allow people to to do that and of course it is the
[1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:23.840]  small businesses that we see the most job creation come from it's not the politically connected
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:28.240]  crony capitalists that have their way with the hillary clinton's and the harry reeds and the
[1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:33.440]  nancy polosi and the george bushes that's not those people that we see creating the most jobs
[1:51:33.440 --> 1:51:40.480]  is actually the small local businesses that's why you know just as you try to do business with local
[1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:45.920]  businesses to try to help your community that's why you need to be involved in what's going on down
[1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:51.520]  ticket um the races that are not so high profile that's why we're talking to uh michael cargill here
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:56.880]  now one of the other things uh that comes up of course you mentioned the importance of a sheriff
[1:51:56.880 --> 1:52:03.360]  in terms of protecting your rights i just went to a forum uh within the last week here on secure
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:11.040]  communities now that is the the program that was created by bush as well as uh by obama administration
[1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:17.280]  where a sheriff if they pick an illegal alien up after uh they've they've arrested them and
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:22.080]  they're holding them they will report it to ice and hold them for up to 48 hours so that ice can
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:27.840]  take a look at their background now what they were doing in this community meeting they were coming
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:34.960]  down hard on the sheriff who is a democrat telling him hey if you're going to send information about
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:40.560]  illegal aliens who've committed crime to ice you're in the wrong party you need to get out of this
[1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:46.320]  party you shouldn't be doing that and yet we see that this california cop killer uh who killed two
[1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:51.840]  cops over the weekend this was somebody who has been deported on multiple times i don't even see
[1:52:51.840 --> 1:52:56.560]  that the deportation is effective as long as we've got such open borders but it was our city
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:53:00.400]  council talking about the importance of elections okay this is whether or not this is going to
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:06.000]  happen in our community comes down to the sheriff who at this point is standing against the city
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:10.640]  council who is telling him don't tell ice if you pick somebody up that has violated the law that's
[1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:14.800]  an illegal alien and that's why that county official is very important because that person
[1:53:14.800 --> 1:53:19.600]  is going to allow ice to come in and say hey uh let's take a look at this guy's records okay and
[1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:25.040]  let's go ahead and hold him because he's been here you know several times he's gone back come over
[1:53:25.040 --> 1:53:30.640]  gone back come over and he's committed crimes it the particular case that you're talking about you
[1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:35.600]  know that that county official he's going to be facing some very hard times when it's time for his
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:40.640]  reelection um you know let's hope so i don't know that uh people are aware of this and and they're
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:45.760]  the activists are really kind of lined up on the uh you know you shouldn't be telling ice that
[1:53:45.760 --> 1:53:51.040]  somebody is here illegally oh no they they should they really should that these people need to go
[1:53:51.040 --> 1:53:56.720]  what what about sergeant tamarisi uh this guy is in mexico um he made a mistake made a wrong turn
[1:53:56.720 --> 1:54:01.200]  now he's held in mexico because he had his personal firearms inside of his vehicle
[1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:05.840]  and now they won't let him go and the president needs to make that call and get sergeant tamarisi
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:10.480]  released immediately yeah mexico has one standard but we're supposed to have a completely different
[1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:15.600]  standard we're supposed to not patrol our borders we're supposed to let everyone in whether or not
[1:54:15.600 --> 1:54:20.400]  they're sick remember when they had the cruise ship we had the lab technician from dallas do a
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:26.000]  self quarantine she didn't have it but she heard that they had been lax on the uh quarantine issues
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.760]  and so she wanted to declare that she had been working there when she didn't put herself in
[1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:34.880]  quarantine belize wooden taker mexico wooden taker they had to ship the entire cruise ship
[1:54:34.880 --> 1:54:41.360]  back to texas every other country in the world patrols their border to make sure that people
[1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:45.920]  are not bringing a pandemic into their country we used to do that at ellis island they used to
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.000]  inspect people to make sure that they weren't sick as they were coming into the country we
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:54.400]  also have a right to know whether somebody has a criminal background when they're coming into our
[1:54:54.400 --> 1:54:59.520]  country and yet with the open borders policy that we see and we're going to really see that
[1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:04.720]  accelerate after the election that's why it's very important for us to have in place patriots
[1:55:04.720 --> 1:55:08.800]  who are going to have the backbone to stand up to this and a lot of a lot of that is going to
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:13.440]  have to happen at the local level right we need to make this president a lame duck president
[1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:19.360]  so that he does not have any power to do anything his last few years because if we allow some of
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:23.760]  the people down on that ballot to get elected that are not looking out for our best interest
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:27.680]  then we're going to be problem we're going to have problems with people crossing over the border
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:32.080]  we're going to have problems with ebola we're going to have problems with our crime our crime is
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:36.320]  going to increase just like we saw in that incident right there with that school shooting
[1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:41.680]  yeah i mean two twice kicked out of the country twice and now he's killed the police officer
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:46.720]  i want to want to explain that to me he actually killed killed two police officers this was a
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:51.920]  a guy who had been sent out he was arrested and convicted in arizona for narcotics position
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:57.520]  1997 and then he was later arrested and sent back to mexico again in 2001 one of the things
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:03.280]  that i heard so that second deportation was simply because he was here illegally or had
[1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:08.080]  prior convictions one of the things that i heard in this meeting against secure communities was
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:13.120]  you shouldn't send somebody back just because they're only here illegally okay that's what
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:16.400]  they're telling this sheriff and that's what they're saying you know you're in the wrong party and
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:20.880]  it's like we need to understand where people are and we need to understand too that in the case of
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:24.880]  this sheriff i don't know what else he stands for and i'm not endorsing him but at least on this
[1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:29.440]  issue he's a democrat fighting his own party and we need to understand that this isn't something
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:34.480]  that you can simply do by voting a partisan checklist you need to understand where these
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:38.800]  people are on the issues that are important as you go down the ballot and the majority of your
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:43.120]  your county officials these sheriffs that are participating in this program what they're doing
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:50.160]  is they're saying hey this person here has committed multiple crimes this person has three dwis uh this
[1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:56.160]  person has actually been charged or convicted of a sex offender with a minor you know sex with a
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:00.160]  minor so we're talking major offenses here we're not talking about a traffic ticket we're not
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:04.080]  talking about a run any stop sign we're not talking about a class c mr. meaner we're talking
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:09.520]  about class b a's and felonies they need to go we don't need to have that riff ref in our country
[1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:13.680]  that's right it's a very dangerous thing to have that we're talking to michael cargill who is uh
[1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:18.720]  running for town council here in austin what's your uh website address that they can find out
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:25.600]  about you might it's cargill for texas uh dot com that's cargill f or texas dot com very important
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:32.240]  very important that you look at what the people down ticket stand for in your location this is
[1:57:32.240 --> 1:57:36.960]  something that we're only going to win if we get involved and understand what is happening at the
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:42.640]  local level and don't underestimate the importance of the sheriff of the city council and protecting
[1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:47.280]  your freedoms as well as just doing the right things making sure that traffic is flowing the
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:58:11.200]  right way the things that government should do
