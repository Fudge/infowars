[00:00.000 --> 00:09.120]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[00:09.120 --> 00:14.760]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[00:14.760 --> 00:15.760]  one!
[00:15.760 --> 00:29.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.320 --> 00:34.480]  While China's arsenal of hypersonic weapons becomes more of an international threat, as
[00:34.480 --> 00:41.080]  China's troops amass on the waters outside of Taiwan and the Atlantic coast of Africa.
[00:41.080 --> 00:47.280]  Some observers have described a nightmare scenario where President Putin invades Ukraine
[00:47.280 --> 00:53.960]  and also simultaneously President Xi uses force to reunify Taiwan with China.
[00:53.960 --> 00:58.360]  Is the U.S. prepared to deal with such a scenario?
[00:58.360 --> 01:04.160]  The United States is going to take every action that we can take from the point of view of
[01:04.160 --> 01:09.520]  both deterrence and diplomacy to make sure that the Taiwan scenario you just described
[01:09.520 --> 01:10.760]  never happens.
[01:10.760 --> 01:15.600]  But if the Biden administration can't even wind down the nearly 20-year occupation of
[01:15.600 --> 01:21.680]  Afghanistan without military deaths and abandonment, wouldn't the real nightmare scenario be an
[01:21.680 --> 01:24.880]  inevitable Biden bungling of World War?
[01:24.880 --> 01:30.040]  And while corporatic senators make reckless, veiled threats like these.
[01:30.040 --> 01:32.440]  What does military action mean, Senator?
[01:32.440 --> 01:36.040]  I would not rule out American troops on the ground.
[01:36.040 --> 01:43.440]  We don't, do you know, we don't rule out first use nuclear action.
[01:43.440 --> 01:49.600]  It is times like these that the skills of Julian Assange are vital to leveling the playing
[01:49.600 --> 01:54.840]  field for a populace continuously kept in the dark by the planners of the pandemic.
[01:54.840 --> 02:01.400]  The great reset and the gradual infiltration of Chinese communism undermining western civilization.
[02:01.400 --> 02:26.840]  I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right, including two Reuters employees.
[02:26.840 --> 02:31.000]  And releasing this cause widespread outrage.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.640]  What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage, do you think?
[02:35.640 --> 02:36.640]  I don't know.
[02:36.640 --> 02:39.760]  I guess people can see the gross disparity in force.
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.040]  You have a guy is walking in a relaxed way down the street and then a patchy helicopter
[02:44.040 --> 02:49.840]  sitting up at a one kilometer firing 30 millimeter cannon shells on everyone looking for any
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.880]  excuse to do so and killing people, rescuing the wounded.
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.200]  And there was two journalists involved who clearly weren't insurgents because that's
[02:58.200 --> 02:59.200]  a full-time job.
[02:59.200 --> 03:05.080]  Instead, Julian Assange, the 50 year old founder of WikiLeaks, faces extradition from Britain
[03:05.080 --> 03:10.720]  to the United States after the U.S. government won an appeal in London's High Court, reportedly
[03:10.720 --> 03:13.680]  causing Julian Assange to suffer a stroke.
[03:13.680 --> 03:16.600]  Didn't hack anybody's computers, he's a journalist.
[03:16.600 --> 03:22.160]  He reprinted facts that were deeply embarrassing to our political class, the Democratic National
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.440]  Committee and to above all the foreign policy establishment, which has an awful lot to be
[03:26.440 --> 03:27.880]  embarrassed of.
[03:27.880 --> 03:31.240]  And for doing that, the New York Times has done things like that for a hundred years,
[03:31.240 --> 03:32.240]  no problem.
[03:32.240 --> 03:33.240]  Julian Assange does it.
[03:33.240 --> 03:37.400]  Well, he's been incarcerated for almost a decade since the summer of 2012.
[03:37.400 --> 03:40.920]  The Biden administration has criminalized telling the truth with this indictment and
[03:40.920 --> 03:46.760]  it's even worse than that, actually, they've criminalized knowing of our classified information.
[03:46.760 --> 03:51.560]  Why is getting your brother more important in bringing, say, murderers to justice?
[03:51.560 --> 03:57.800]  People who run our democracies now would like to rule them, you know, with impunity.
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.160]  They don't want people to know what's been done in their name.
[04:01.160 --> 04:03.280]  They want to keep secrets.
[04:03.280 --> 04:07.920]  They want to, they don't want the public to be informed, basically.
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.360]  I think that's why, and they're creating, Julian, they're making an example out of Julian.
[04:13.360 --> 04:19.360]  They're saying to people, if you tell the truth about our secrets, if you tell the truth
[04:19.360 --> 04:25.160]  about the security state or anything really, this is what's going to happen to you.
[04:25.160 --> 04:30.640]  You're going to be locked in a prison for the rest of your life, your reputation will
[04:30.640 --> 04:34.480]  be destroyed, you'll be taken away from your family.
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.720]  If your brother is extradited in the United States, do you think he'll survive?
[04:37.720 --> 04:40.840]  If he gets extradited, he will most likely die.
[04:40.840 --> 04:46.480]  Assange was a weapon of the First Amendment, wrestling the documents that forced transparency
[04:46.480 --> 04:52.320]  from a secretive military and political industrial complex, hiding earth-shattering revelations
[04:52.320 --> 04:56.560]  that affect all of humanity and the future of the Republic.
[04:56.560 --> 04:59.560]  John Bowne reporting.
[04:59.560 --> 05:05.360]  Everything I do get our great bag of it here.
[05:05.360 --> 05:09.600]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[05:09.600 --> 05:14.040]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild, harvested, above
[05:14.040 --> 05:18.400]  organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee, and yeah, we buy it from
[05:18.400 --> 05:21.360]  the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really, they're just
[05:21.360 --> 05:22.360]  a commune.
[05:22.360 --> 05:25.720]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it, and the farmers
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.000]  don't let the Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.760]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[05:31.760 --> 05:36.480]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just
[05:36.480 --> 05:38.600]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[05:38.600 --> 05:42.120]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[05:42.120 --> 05:49.360]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, but yeah, I'd like to, I'll tell you
[05:49.360 --> 05:50.360]  if you want to believe it.
[05:50.360 --> 05:55.120]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't
[05:55.120 --> 06:00.800]  fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[06:00.800 --> 06:17.340]  So, I'll see you in a few minutes.
[06:17.340 --> 06:29.920]  It's Tuesday, December 14th.
[06:29.920 --> 06:37.600]  year is 2021 as we plunge into the year 2022. The United States government
[06:37.600 --> 06:42.280]  hijacked controlled by the kleptocratic psychotic globalist is now laying out
[06:42.280 --> 06:48.640]  battle plans to attack Russia if Russia defends any of its interest in eastern
[06:48.640 --> 06:53.040]  Ukraine. That is incredible news we're going to be getting to. Germany has now
[06:53.040 --> 06:59.000]  blocked something that Biden didn't even try to block. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.440]  out of Russia into Western Europe. Germany has blocked it and so you can see
[07:05.440 --> 07:10.840]  war written all over this. European gas prices at record high as Germany blocks
[07:10.840 --> 07:16.520]  Nord Stream 2 ladies and gentlemen just like our pipelines are being cut off as
[07:16.520 --> 07:21.160]  well. The West is being set up to go bankrupt and collapse. That is the great
[07:21.160 --> 07:25.680]  reset so they can collapse civilization and build back better and that's really
[07:25.680 --> 07:31.800]  our top story today is what's behind the COVID-19 hysteria and the lockdowns and
[07:31.800 --> 07:35.680]  the global IDs. What's behind war with Russia? What's behind installing the
[07:35.680 --> 07:38.640]  Communist Chinese and letting them take over the world? What's behind all the
[07:38.640 --> 07:42.440]  pedophilia and all the Hollywood corruption? What's the fountain of it? Where
[07:42.440 --> 07:48.000]  does it all come from? What's the root of it? And it is the International
[07:48.000 --> 07:56.400]  Criminal Consortium made up of megabanks, intelligence agencies and subsidiary
[07:56.400 --> 08:02.040]  corporations that after World War II got the different power brokers together of
[08:02.040 --> 08:09.000]  the world through the Bilderberg Group in the 1954 in Oosterbeck Holland and what
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.840]  had been the OSS and then CIA created the organization. We have their corporate
[08:15.840 --> 08:22.800]  minutes that were smuggled out by patriots since the 70s and 80s who had
[08:22.800 --> 08:29.760]  access to intelligence files in in one case the US Senator's office who was
[08:29.760 --> 08:33.960]  retired the Archivist released this information. Then I was covering Bilderberg
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.520]  Group in DC when they were meeting in Chantilly in Virginia outside DC but now
[08:38.520 --> 08:45.360]  15 years ago and another Archivist showed up and gave me hundreds of pages of
[08:45.360 --> 08:50.400]  secret documents that investigative journalists then used to blow Bilderberg
[08:50.400 --> 08:57.120]  Group wide open and from that point on ladies and gentlemen they could not
[08:57.120 --> 09:08.480]  hide it anymore. So we've tracked the Bilderberg Group to Eastern Europe and
[09:08.480 --> 09:14.480]  to Turkey and to Germany and to the UK and to Canada and to the United States.
[09:14.480 --> 09:19.120]  I've tracked them all over the Western world where they meet and that's in my
[09:19.120 --> 09:28.040]  film Endgame but the reason that this is so incredibly important is that we've
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.160]  now discovered how the networks work and operate right into local government and
[09:34.160 --> 09:37.800]  now that they're emerging to not just control the money and wealth of the
[09:37.800 --> 09:41.360]  earth but to actually destroy everybody else's wealth and consolidate it for
[09:41.360 --> 09:49.920]  depopulation which was their main goal in more documents that leaked. They are
[09:49.920 --> 09:55.960]  now externalizing the method in the hierarchy and admitting that this is
[09:55.960 --> 09:59.480]  their program and you hear their slogans the great reset and build back
[09:59.480 --> 10:04.240]  better. So whether it's your local school with Drag Queen Storytime or your state
[10:04.240 --> 10:06.760]  government saying we're not worried about having debts anymore we want to
[10:06.760 --> 10:11.000]  abolish the police they say we're gonna build back better while they destroy
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.760]  everything. Build back better whether it's the corrupt leaders of Australia or
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.240]  New Zealand or Canada or Germany or the UK or the US. When you hear them say
[10:20.240 --> 10:31.120]  build back better that'd be like a James Bond movie or Specter buys off all the
[10:31.120 --> 10:34.280]  major politicians of the world and releases a virus for political control
[10:34.280 --> 10:39.600]  and power to take over and establish itself as the world government. You're
[10:39.600 --> 10:43.280]  like well that's actually what's happening well Ian Fleming was in OSS at
[10:43.280 --> 10:49.640]  the highest levels he then was the deputy head of the MI6 out of the OSS and
[10:49.640 --> 10:54.800]  he wrote more than 15 books on different plans and things that they'd batted
[10:54.800 --> 10:58.960]  around for their future operations. That's why there's a global group of
[10:58.960 --> 11:02.480]  billionaires that release a bio weapon to kill everybody on earth while they're
[11:02.480 --> 11:06.560]  on a space station. That's why there's movies where they buy up all the water
[11:06.560 --> 11:09.480]  to cut the water supply off to bankrupt third-world countries and then take
[11:09.480 --> 11:12.880]  control of them. That's why they have the latest movie where there's a bio weapon
[11:12.880 --> 11:17.120]  released that's tailored to only kill the person that gets it. All of that is
[11:17.120 --> 11:21.200]  real stuff that they throw in your face so when you think about Specter and the
[11:21.200 --> 11:28.600]  guy with the cat that's Klaus Schwab because it was people in his family and
[11:28.600 --> 11:33.680]  other families that act and behave exactly the same that the former deputy
[11:33.680 --> 11:40.000]  head of MI6 knew personally. Ian Fleming went to Bilderberg group meetings on
[11:40.000 --> 11:47.520]  record. Came out long after his death. He was at these so Rand Paul and Donald
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.520]  Trump and all these people that could be our leaders won't even address what
[11:51.520 --> 11:55.880]  we're up against. Won't even address that we're in a war and who they are. Yes
[11:55.880 --> 12:00.600]  Trump got us out of the UN to a great extent, UNESCO and the rest of it. Good
[12:00.600 --> 12:07.800]  job. Obama put us Obama 2.0, Biden I think of him as Obama, it is Obama put us
[12:07.800 --> 12:14.880]  right back in. And so if we don't address who they are and how they're
[12:14.880 --> 12:18.840]  operating we don't have any hope of stopping these people so at the bottom
[12:18.840 --> 12:24.200]  of the hour I'm going to go over the latest developments because a whole
[12:24.200 --> 12:28.120]  bunch of information came together and then right as I was already planning to
[12:28.120 --> 12:34.440]  cover this today actually yesterday and I got too busy and didn't do it. Greg
[12:34.440 --> 12:39.240]  Reese sends me his latest report that is on this exact subject on the exact
[12:39.240 --> 12:45.840]  subgroup I was going to hit yesterday so the Lord works in mysterious ways. A lot
[12:45.840 --> 12:49.280]  of times I get up here and I make hours of preparation for the show and then
[12:49.280 --> 12:52.960]  those are the worst broadcasts sometimes. I'm not saying it was a bad show but I
[12:52.960 --> 13:00.120]  just get so upset by the time I'm on air looking at it that I just have
[13:00.120 --> 13:04.800]  unable to cover it and that happened yesterday. I mean I legitimately just my
[13:04.800 --> 13:10.360]  brain turns off. Well my brain's not turned off today. It's very focused right
[13:10.360 --> 13:14.480]  now so bottom of the hour I'm going to play Greg Reese's latest report if you
[13:14.480 --> 13:19.440]  scroll down there you can see it dealing with this and I called him this morning
[13:19.440 --> 13:22.400]  and I said I want you to do a longer report on the whole enchilada and he's
[13:22.400 --> 13:27.680]  going to be doing that. The Banking Cartel School for Judas Goats and I mean
[13:27.680 --> 13:32.000]  you understand the Bilderberg group trained Gavin Newsom, the Bilderberg
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.440]  group trained Kamala Harris, the Bilderberg group trained Boris Johnson,
[13:36.440 --> 13:41.000]  the Bilderberg group trained Angela Merkel, the Bilderberg group trained the
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.280]  new chancellor of Germany. On record oh and guess what they trained Leonardo
[13:46.280 --> 13:52.720]  DiCaprio and they trained almost all the top Hollywood stars Tom Hanks all of
[13:52.720 --> 13:59.600]  them spend months a year not in Davos and Switzerland on a mountain top but with
[13:59.600 --> 14:03.440]  these people you think Scientologists are a mafia group out there operating
[14:03.440 --> 14:07.960]  they're like a grain of sand if you have a bad totally bad view of them
[14:07.960 --> 14:13.400]  compared to these people. These people are the Himalayan mountains compared to a
[14:13.400 --> 14:17.960]  grain of sand this is the real group and of course Rand Paul knows that of course
[14:17.960 --> 14:23.480]  Ted Cruz knows that of course they all know that they know if you talk about
[14:23.480 --> 14:27.680]  these people you get destroyed that's what they're trying to make an example out
[14:27.680 --> 14:34.960]  of me but we're here making it safe for everybody to talk about it we're here
[14:34.960 --> 14:40.360]  making it safe for Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and everybody else and it's
[14:40.360 --> 14:44.560]  starting to happen and Elon Musk has been signaling again that he's not with
[14:44.560 --> 14:48.480]  this group he wants to lead the new elite that's pro-human if that's actually
[14:48.480 --> 14:53.400]  the truth then I'm all behind that but I've said to Elon I'm gonna leave it at
[14:53.400 --> 14:58.520]  that message to Elon that he needs to come out and really show us who he is
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.120]  we've seen some dramatic action in the last month but I'm not saying he's a
[15:03.120 --> 15:06.320]  savior but he's come out against these people saying they're dangerous saying
[15:06.320 --> 15:09.000]  they're mind-controlling us and saying we shouldn't be forced to take
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.600]  inoculations and we shouldn't be forced into this world government and that the
[15:12.600 --> 15:15.720]  governments are devaluing the currencies and consolidating power and waging
[15:15.720 --> 15:18.840]  war against us and we've got to come together for a pro-human future and have
[15:18.840 --> 15:24.520]  more children and innovate well that's what a tree that's good says Christ said
[15:24.520 --> 15:32.440]  you judge a tree by its fruits and Elon Musk has 95% good fruit the part about
[15:32.440 --> 15:35.600]  brain chips well he says if you want them he doesn't want you to have to take
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.360]  them so I get his point but still he said watch out for those that worship AI
[15:40.360 --> 15:44.040]  gods which is the globalist is they want to kill you that's true so out of
[15:44.040 --> 15:47.840]  this whole crop of globalist Elon Musk is the best of them or he's the most
[15:47.840 --> 15:51.920]  sophisticated and is actually the head of them but we'll find out soon enough
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.880]  won't we we are living in the future we are living in the year 2021 stay with
[15:55.880 --> 16:02.880]  us if you're concerned about the power everything I do is about victory for
[16:02.880 --> 16:07.400]  humanity everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order
[16:07.400 --> 16:11.800]  by empowering humanity well that's why reset wars dot com is so important not
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.080]  only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your
[16:16.080 --> 16:20.240]  mind from the matrix but it's something that gets around
[16:20.240 --> 16:25.720]  plow Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American
[16:25.720 --> 16:32.240]  jobs it is the true digital economy it's the spiritual economy of the mind and
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.960]  transcendent or control I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has

[17:02.080 --> 17:06.240]  to Malcolm in Tennessee welcome hello Alex yes Malcolm all right I'll make this
[17:06.240 --> 17:10.200]  quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line Alex I
[17:10.200 --> 17:14.680]  have to promote one thing from one of your co-host Owen shroyer super male
[17:14.680 --> 17:19.280]  volatility and brain force plus mix those two together you're an unstoppable
[17:19.280 --> 17:24.400]  tank super male volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural
[17:24.400 --> 17:29.880]  compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared
[17:29.880 --> 17:33.800]  to powdered versions but also work quite well but just aren't as strong this is
[17:33.800 --> 17:37.880]  like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes
[17:37.880 --> 17:41.000]  it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.880]  something and admitting sometimes the batches in a strong that's just how it
[17:43.880 --> 17:49.080]  is it's how it works so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super
[17:49.080 --> 17:55.400]  strong but yeah if you want the Rolls-Royce at a decent price then this is it
[18:00.920 --> 18:07.960]  what are champions made of here's a man who can show you
[18:07.960 --> 18:16.280]  my
[18:37.960 --> 18:59.700]  If a war store.com is simply the best, If a war store.com beats out all the rest.
[18:59.700 --> 19:04.600]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait until they've
[19:04.600 --> 19:10.040]  They've got their world ID and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[19:10.040 --> 19:15.680]  And CloudSwab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that
[19:15.680 --> 19:20.800]  once they've gotten you with that system then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere
[19:20.800 --> 19:23.240]  you go and track what you do.
[19:23.240 --> 19:26.960]  And publicly they're saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when you
[19:26.960 --> 19:27.960]  can't travel.
[19:27.960 --> 19:32.400]  And MasterCard and all the other big companies are currently announcing that they're going
[19:32.400 --> 19:37.480]  to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[19:37.480 --> 19:41.080]  This is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen.
[19:41.080 --> 19:42.080]  This is the takeover.
[19:42.080 --> 19:44.400]  In humanity better wake up and say no.
[19:44.400 --> 19:46.080]  Finally folks are starting to wake up.
[19:46.080 --> 19:49.760]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others are leaving the charts along with them fours but it's
[19:49.760 --> 19:50.760]  not enough.
[19:50.760 --> 19:54.600]  Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalists
[19:54.600 --> 19:55.600]  to justice.
[19:55.600 --> 20:01.600]  You see they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[20:01.600 --> 20:11.440]  Bringing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.440 --> 20:21.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[20:21.000 --> 20:24.920]  Reset wars have begun.
[20:24.920 --> 20:32.120]  Businesses of research and work is now available at resetwars.com.
[20:32.120 --> 20:39.600]  Info wars greatest achievement is now available to the public at resetwars.com.
[20:39.600 --> 20:49.600]  The reset wars have begun.
[20:49.600 --> 20:56.720]  Do you go to the full show headline on infowars.com, there's some very important information there.
[20:56.720 --> 20:59.880]  World War 3 question mark.
[20:59.880 --> 21:05.640]  Biden reveals plan to attack Russia, got this right here in my hand, as Germany blocks Putin's
[21:05.640 --> 21:10.040]  Nord Stream gas pipeline.
[21:10.040 --> 21:16.200]  Global exclusive top researchers have identified the secret corporate intelligence agency that
[21:16.200 --> 21:24.560]  launched COVID-19 while commanding the Great Reset to conquer the world.
[21:24.560 --> 21:30.960]  Meanwhile, humanity is awakening, Elon Musk and Ben Shapiro have both come out and condemned
[21:30.960 --> 21:35.600]  big pharma's bioweapon vaccine saying it's all a power grab and not about protecting
[21:35.600 --> 21:36.600]  us.
[21:36.600 --> 21:42.800]  Ben Shapiro has been pro-vax, pro-COVID-19 BS, but now all of his listeners have turned
[21:42.800 --> 21:49.720]  against him so he's being forced by the force of will, your will to be a good person or
[21:49.720 --> 21:52.000]  to do the right thing.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.560]  Elon Musk has not been forced to that position and early on said he wouldn't take the injection
[21:56.560 --> 22:01.160]  if he was you and that it looked like it would attack your immune system which it does.
[22:01.160 --> 22:06.680]  So I'm not in a Elon Musk worship fest, I just when I see somebody at this level doing
[22:06.680 --> 22:12.640]  the right thing, a lot of what he says irrevocably damages the globalist, you've got to give
[22:12.640 --> 22:15.720]  it credit and Joe hangs out with him all the time, they're big buddies, I'm going to leave
[22:15.720 --> 22:20.960]  it at that, but they go to each other's houses and all the rest of it and he tells me Elon
[22:20.960 --> 22:21.960]  is awake.
[22:21.960 --> 22:25.960]  I mean it took a lot to get Joe over to being fully awake to the New World Order he is
[22:25.960 --> 22:26.960]  now.
[22:26.960 --> 22:33.280]  Again I had dinner with him twice last week and he's just completely awake, I mean because
[22:33.280 --> 22:37.680]  Joe is as smart as I am or smarter, that's why he's so good at so many different disciplines
[22:37.680 --> 22:42.840]  and now that he isn't naive anymore and now that he sees it, you can't unsee it.
[22:42.840 --> 22:48.760]  So I'm going to make this announcement right here and this is not again to thump my chest,
[22:48.760 --> 22:54.160]  this is not to spike the football, this is to let you know how much danger I'm in and
[22:54.160 --> 22:57.120]  that I really do need your prayer and support now more than ever.
[22:57.120 --> 23:02.760]  I am seen by the globalist and I knew this four or five years ago and I knew even a decade
[23:02.760 --> 23:06.840]  ago that they saw me as the leader of the populist resistance worldwide because they
[23:06.840 --> 23:10.800]  could track all the different movements around the world and from Brazil to the UK to Germany
[23:10.800 --> 23:14.920]  to Japan, I mean I could really get their attention when I had the Japanese Vice President
[23:14.920 --> 23:21.360]  on about 9-11 and stuff like that and that's why the Kissinger Group tried to hire me and
[23:21.360 --> 23:27.280]  the rest of it and the Kissinger Group is, the Bilderberg Group is, Klaus Schwab is them
[23:27.280 --> 23:32.920]  and that's what they do, they recruit their opposition, I said no and they basically said
[23:32.920 --> 23:38.560]  so you choose the way of pain and I, it doesn't sound funny to me to be owned by these people
[23:38.560 --> 23:43.040]  and be part of this evil agenda and then pretend I'm an elitist and then go to these conferences
[23:43.040 --> 23:47.160]  with them and be part of their evil, what because I won't get prosecuted because I can
[23:47.160 --> 23:52.880]  have sex with hookers all day or screw little kids, no thank you.
[23:52.880 --> 23:56.480]  But let me just as a testament to our 28 years of fighting together, many of you have been
[23:56.480 --> 24:03.480]  listening over 25 years, I am seen as the leader and that's why they're after us and
[24:03.480 --> 24:10.360]  whereas you're humble and I'm humble and we don't think of ourselves in that type of
[24:10.360 --> 24:14.640]  light, you don't think of yourself as the tip of the spear, you are in just your support
[24:14.640 --> 24:18.840]  of this broadcast alone and then everything else you do and they see American opposition
[24:18.840 --> 24:22.920]  to the New World Order as their only opposition around the world, as bad as America is, that
[24:22.920 --> 24:29.120]  old bill of rights and constitution, our old Americans sensibilities were the freest country
[24:29.120 --> 24:32.800]  in the world of an industrialized nation from the COVID BS.
[24:32.800 --> 24:39.320]  We have the best defenses against the great reset and out of that resistance, this little
[24:39.320 --> 24:46.280]  ship is the flagship, this ragtag operation is the best we've got to offer but it's true,
[24:46.280 --> 24:51.520]  it's populist and it has got on its side and that's why this David is winning battles
[24:51.520 --> 24:56.640]  against the Goliath but that's why we need your prayer and your support, that's why
[24:56.640 --> 25:01.360]  we need to thank the local stations that pick up the show, you do in my view and we have
[25:01.360 --> 25:04.520]  to thank God for the position we've been put in, I'm very honored to be here, I'm very
[25:04.520 --> 25:08.960]  honored to be persecuted, it's not fun and God always keeps us right on the edge to
[25:08.960 --> 25:15.840]  keep us humble but then always provides the last minute like the Liddos might but I just
[25:15.840 --> 25:18.560]  knew this morning I had to come in here and tell you this, I've known this for a while
[25:18.560 --> 25:24.040]  but I think we have to recognize it and know it, the globalists have seen Info Wars, I'm
[25:24.040 --> 25:27.320]  just a focal point of that, this is a whole family that you're part of, that you're an
[25:27.320 --> 25:30.400]  endricle part of, you're not just an outside of it, you're the heart of it, you're the
[25:30.400 --> 25:34.480]  guts of it, the blood of it, the brains of it, the eyes of it, the will of it, you are
[25:34.480 --> 25:39.240]  the progenitor power of it to wake up more people so you want to use analogy, you are
[25:39.240 --> 25:44.560]  the genitals of it, you are the entire thing, you understand that, you are it, you are it
[25:44.560 --> 25:50.960]  and they know and they fear this community we have ladies and gentlemen, they fear the
[25:50.960 --> 25:54.760]  power we have as their evil tries to take over, they know we're their opposition, they
[25:54.760 --> 26:01.280]  know of old we'd be challenging them and we're here and so we've been put in this position
[26:01.280 --> 26:07.960]  as the leaders of the resistance and I am seen as the leader worldwide of the populist
[26:07.960 --> 26:11.800]  resistance to their takeover, in my whole life I couldn't imagine that, that I'd be in the
[26:11.800 --> 26:21.720]  position of the evil one, this fallen entity seeing Alex Jones as the tip of the spear
[26:21.720 --> 26:28.120]  and as the archetypal example of the humans it wants to kill, steal and destroy and that's
[26:28.120 --> 26:31.800]  all God working through me and you supporting us and God working through you but let's not
[26:31.800 --> 26:38.640]  lie about this, let's not because it needs to be said, it would be a lie if I continued
[26:38.640 --> 26:42.040]  in the name of humbleness to not tell you what I've known for years and I think a lot
[26:42.040 --> 26:46.400]  of you already recognize that, people recognize that everywhere but we're together and being
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.240]  on the tip of the spear means I'm not stupid, I know there's very low chances I'm going
[26:50.240 --> 26:53.840]  to make it out of this, that's okay, I'd die a thousand times to be here with you right
[26:53.840 --> 26:58.640]  now in what we're going into as they literally inject our children with a system that turns
[26:58.640 --> 27:02.840]  off their white blood cells and gives them the equivalent of AIDS, I mean of course
[27:02.840 --> 27:06.400]  we better stand up against these people, of course we better resist whatever thing we've
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.540]  got, what type of family do we come from, would your grandparents appreciate you not
[27:11.540 --> 27:16.800]  fighting back, would your great grandparents, would your parents, this is our chance to
[27:16.800 --> 27:22.960]  do the right thing, our chance to shine in front of God and country and the world.
[27:22.960 --> 27:25.800]  So I'm going to come back and get into the globalist and who our enemy is and what we're
[27:25.800 --> 27:31.040]  up against and what their plan is and how to stop them but I think it's most important
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.720]  for all of you, you can be living in Africa, you can be living in South America, you can
[27:35.720 --> 27:40.760]  be living in Japan or Russia or the United States or anywhere, Mexico, if you love justice
[27:40.760 --> 27:44.680]  and freedom and you see through this and you know what's going on, we are all interconnected
[27:44.680 --> 27:51.320]  spiritually, we are brothers and sisters forever and we are all part of this body of
[27:51.320 --> 27:55.200]  humanity that wants a future and loves our children and are not going to bow to the satanic
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.200]  system that's making its move, that it's prepared for hundreds of years, really thousands but
[28:00.200 --> 28:04.360]  hundreds they've been preparing this same group out of the British Empire, it's not
[28:04.360 --> 28:07.840]  the British people, it's the folks that run the British Empire and now they're making
[28:07.840 --> 28:16.320]  their big move in the year 2020, 2021, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and they believe
[28:16.320 --> 28:21.520]  they say that at least 80 to 90% of us, they give different numbers, will be dead within
[28:21.520 --> 28:22.520]  eight years.
[28:22.520 --> 28:26.440]  Well I've got a prediction to make and I don't even care about killing these people or not
[28:26.440 --> 28:29.120]  even, I just want them to get out of our way and I'm not going to launch any attacks on
[28:29.120 --> 28:35.320]  them offensively, but I've got a prediction to be made that in 2030, their new world order
[28:35.320 --> 28:39.840]  is basically gone and wiped out and collapsed and that they're going to be the ones that
[28:39.840 --> 28:41.640]  aren't going to be on this planet.
[28:41.640 --> 28:46.240]  So they've attacked us, they've started the war, we've tried to get out of it but they're
[28:46.240 --> 28:48.280]  not going to let us.
[28:48.280 --> 28:51.440]  The Bible is now being fulfilled ladies and gentlemen, you are living in the beginning
[28:51.440 --> 28:58.680]  of the end times, Satan gets his hour of power and then it's over.
[28:58.680 --> 28:59.680]  Hey everybody.
[28:59.680 --> 29:00.680]  Confused?
[29:00.680 --> 29:04.520]  Get our great bag of it here.
[29:04.520 --> 29:09.240]  I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[29:09.240 --> 29:13.960]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[29:13.960 --> 29:17.720]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[29:17.720 --> 29:21.680]  farmers that the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever
[29:21.680 --> 29:25.240]  the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[29:25.240 --> 29:28.760]  Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've
[29:28.760 --> 29:30.880]  been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[29:30.880 --> 29:34.960]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, per pound
[29:34.960 --> 29:37.760]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[29:37.760 --> 29:42.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[29:42.000 --> 29:49.560]  not going to tell you a little story, I'd like to, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[29:49.560 --> 29:54.280]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[29:54.280 --> 30:00.000]  fund us and don't want to steer, that's fine.
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.520]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in infowar's live products and that's
[30:04.520 --> 30:08.840]  why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth and we could never
[30:08.840 --> 30:13.880]  get the ingredients again until now and we have reformulated and not just used the same
[30:13.880 --> 30:17.560]  ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.

[32:00.560 --> 32:10.200]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the change
[32:10.200 --> 32:14.600]  that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the global private corporations has put
[32:14.600 --> 32:15.600]  in place.
[32:15.600 --> 32:21.160]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[32:21.160 --> 32:26.600]  It is the symbol that we are diseased at evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[32:26.600 --> 32:29.520]  faces from the light of the sun.
[32:29.520 --> 32:37.640]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[32:37.640 --> 32:42.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[32:42.080 --> 32:45.520]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[32:45.520 --> 32:49.000]  Cloud Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.840]  the world ID and carbon taxes.
[32:51.840 --> 32:54.000]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[32:54.000 --> 33:01.760]  They only get better if we resist and say no, non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
[33:01.760 --> 33:30.760]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.760 --> 33:40.560]  So, here we are at the final twilight days of 2021, plunging in 2022, the year where
[33:40.560 --> 33:46.320]  the globalists are really going to sink their teeth into us and set up the permanent lockdowns,
[33:46.320 --> 33:50.520]  the forts inoculations, the martial law, it's all being announced across the world by the
[33:50.520 --> 33:51.520]  same group.
[33:51.520 --> 33:57.360]  So, doesn't everybody ask, why does the leader of the UK, the leader of Australia, the leader
[33:57.360 --> 34:01.800]  of the US, the leader of Germany, the leader of France, the leader of New Zealand, the leaders
[34:01.800 --> 34:10.520]  of more than 100 countries all get up in lockstep and say, the great reset, build back better.
[34:10.520 --> 34:11.960]  We need carbon taxes.
[34:11.960 --> 34:13.400]  We need carbon lockdowns.
[34:13.400 --> 34:17.880]  We need the same phone apps run by the UN and the Davos group to tell us where we can
[34:17.880 --> 34:18.880]  go, what we do.
[34:18.880 --> 34:19.880]  We need carbon taxes.
[34:19.880 --> 34:21.120]  We need social credit score.
[34:21.120 --> 34:28.800]  We need drag queen story time from Perth, Australia to New York City, New York.
[34:28.800 --> 34:29.800]  Why?
[34:29.800 --> 34:31.840]  It's all this group.
[34:31.840 --> 34:38.120]  If you watch the Davos group and you read their writings, Hoss Schwab gets up and says,
[34:38.120 --> 34:42.600]  we must teach the children to be gay so they do not have to be more children.
[34:42.600 --> 34:43.600]  They say it all.
[34:43.600 --> 34:48.000]  It's not that I hate somebody that's, quote, gay, I'm trying to explain to people that
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.200]  they're pushing this for depopulation.
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.320]  Everything they do is about control from electric cars to the windmills.
[34:56.320 --> 34:58.160]  It's not about energy and a future.
[34:58.160 --> 35:02.760]  It's about sabotaging the industrial world and ending it in their own words.
[35:02.760 --> 35:08.440]  You're not going to elect them and get free healthcare and free tuition and free everything.
[35:08.440 --> 35:11.880]  You get nothing once they get control.
[35:11.880 --> 35:17.040]  And now you see, Biden's come out and says, oh, I promised everybody all these free student
[35:17.040 --> 35:18.040]  loans and everything.
[35:18.040 --> 35:19.040]  Sorry, you don't get that.
[35:19.040 --> 35:21.240]  Of course, that was all coming.
[35:21.240 --> 35:30.920]  So here's a cover of a magazine from hard to believe this is eight, nine years ago.
[35:30.920 --> 35:34.040]  This is nine years ago, 2013.
[35:34.040 --> 35:35.040]  And who is it?
[35:35.040 --> 35:45.000]  It's Eric Schmidt of Google as the Mater D or the Butler serving the planet up on a silver
[35:45.000 --> 35:51.880]  platter to Henry Kissinger Bill Gates, David Rockefeller, Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan and
[35:51.880 --> 35:55.240]  a bunch of other Bilderberg group members.
[35:55.240 --> 36:00.000]  Elite plan, global takeover, welcome to Bilderberg.
[36:00.000 --> 36:03.000]  And then we predict they're going to use a virus to take control of the planet.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  Why?
[36:04.000 --> 36:05.000]  Because we got their internal documents.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.640]  Might have been some important information.
[36:07.640 --> 36:10.840]  People ask, how do I know all this stuff?
[36:10.840 --> 36:15.320]  I didn't print up a million of these and hand them out for free in a bunch of major cities
[36:15.320 --> 36:19.760]  like Austin and D.C. and spend that money I had that I could have, you know, put my
[36:19.760 --> 36:22.400]  children's fund or whatever.
[36:22.400 --> 36:24.680]  I didn't do that because I was playing tiddlywinks.
[36:24.680 --> 36:26.720]  I did it because I knew it was coming.
[36:26.720 --> 36:32.800]  These people aren't playing games.
[36:32.800 --> 36:37.360]  Here's another headline video, Rand Paul warrants COVID mandates are about conditioning the
[36:37.360 --> 36:44.400]  American individual to submit to government, yes, top Catholic cardinal head of the Vatican
[36:44.400 --> 36:50.600]  court came out an incredible interview and said it's a world government that's planning
[36:50.600 --> 36:53.840]  to make us all slaves with global IDs and the mark of the beast.
[36:53.840 --> 36:57.080]  And it's all run by Klaus Schwab and it controls much of the Vatican.
[36:57.080 --> 37:00.240]  I mean, you talk about, we want to see insiders go public.
[37:00.240 --> 37:04.520]  This guy is the most powerful cardinal in Europe, the head cardinal in Germany and the
[37:04.520 --> 37:08.160]  head of the Vatican court.
[37:08.160 --> 37:09.680]  And everything he says is word to word.
[37:09.680 --> 37:14.920]  What I say, not because he's following when I say because it's true.
[37:14.920 --> 37:19.000]  And this guy might be a little bit worried about his immortal soul because if you don't
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.640]  stand up against this, I mean, you are signed up with the old devil.
[37:23.640 --> 37:27.720]  We're going to come play some of that next segment.
[37:27.720 --> 37:34.680]  Another cardinal warrants elites ushering in total control surveillance state through COVID.
[37:34.680 --> 37:36.760]  Got to read the article on info wars.com.
[37:36.760 --> 37:37.760]  Got to read the transcript.
[37:37.760 --> 37:38.760]  Got to see the video.
[37:38.760 --> 37:41.480]  It's in German.
[37:41.480 --> 37:53.040]  There's another one from Mises Institute rating the world bank exposing a fondness for dictators
[37:53.040 --> 37:56.760]  and it goes into how they want dictatorship in their own words and who is the IMF and
[37:56.760 --> 38:00.000]  World Bank, the private banking families, less than 10 families.
[38:00.000 --> 38:01.800]  And they don't like you running around on the earth.
[38:01.800 --> 38:03.160]  They don't like you.
[38:03.160 --> 38:04.280]  They want you off the earth.
[38:04.280 --> 38:07.280]  They think they own it through fraud.
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.520]  California, the story yesterday, tells the public in official letters, we won't tell
[38:11.520 --> 38:13.840]  you where $300 billion are.
[38:13.840 --> 38:15.120]  This is why they're so arrogant.
[38:15.120 --> 38:16.120]  This is why they're so criminal.
[38:16.120 --> 38:18.920]  And now they're going to give you shots in a racial immune system where you die from
[38:18.920 --> 38:19.920]  a common cold.
[38:19.920 --> 38:24.120]  Then they tell you, oh, the unvaccinated got you sick.
[38:24.120 --> 38:28.720]  The communist Chinese head spokesperson said the era in which the U.S. acted arbitrarily
[38:28.720 --> 38:34.960]  in the world under the pretext of democracy, human rights is over, citing the police state,
[38:34.960 --> 38:36.800]  citing what the CIA has done.
[38:36.800 --> 38:42.400]  But the globalists did this on purpose to maneuver us into this position.
[38:42.400 --> 38:48.400]  IMF, 10 countries simulate cyber attack on global financial system.
[38:48.400 --> 38:52.280]  That's going to be their next big move.
[38:52.280 --> 38:56.480]  Banking assets at $52 trillion, growing by $40 trillion since 2008.
[38:56.480 --> 38:58.440]  This is what HyperMMT looks like.
[38:58.440 --> 39:00.240]  I'll explain that when we come back.
[39:00.240 --> 39:06.760]  But if you want to understand how this group controls people, look right here, Chris Cuomo
[39:06.760 --> 39:12.320]  and his head producer arrested for training little girls how to be sex operatives to serve
[39:12.320 --> 39:13.320]  the quote elite.
[39:13.320 --> 39:14.320]  That's what this is.
[39:14.320 --> 39:17.400]  He was sex training with their mothers.
[39:17.400 --> 39:21.200]  He was just a Jeffrey Epstein mini-me.
[39:21.200 --> 39:26.440]  You don't even get in this club, as I've told you, unless you're part of this.
[39:26.440 --> 39:29.040]  They've all got that look on their eyes.
[39:29.040 --> 39:33.040]  If you look really close, those eyes look scared, don't they?
[39:33.040 --> 39:38.200]  Because they know they signed on and they're scared.
[39:38.200 --> 39:41.040]  They signed on to evil and lost everything in their lives.
[39:41.040 --> 39:42.040]  Now they're slaves.
[39:42.040 --> 39:46.520]  Now they've got to go out and commit all these horrible crimes against humanity, like knowingly
[39:46.520 --> 39:49.960]  killing 20-plus thousand people and locking their families out so they couldn't see them
[39:49.960 --> 39:55.400]  in New York nursing homes, so $53,000 could be cut up amongst Cuomo and his family and
[39:55.400 --> 39:56.400]  the globalist.
[39:56.400 --> 39:58.200]  They all followed orders of Klaus Schwab to do it.
[39:58.200 --> 40:00.600]  They did it all over the world, but why are they being burned?
[40:00.600 --> 40:02.120]  I'll talk more about that coming up.
[40:02.120 --> 40:05.280]  It's an example to their minions that if they don't follow orders, this is what's going
[40:05.280 --> 40:06.280]  to happen.
[40:06.280 --> 40:10.520]  They don't let people get into positions of power at that level in those blue states
[40:10.520 --> 40:12.040]  unless they are beyond evil.
[40:12.040 --> 40:16.200]  If you look at the new governor, not just her evil actions, not just all her police
[40:16.200 --> 40:20.560]  state actions, not just her little new lockdowns and trying to keep people from able to see
[40:20.560 --> 40:23.920]  their families and nursing homes and all the rest of it, or saying that she's Jesus
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.480]  and you're her disciples, you just look at her and you go, that's an evil damn woman
[40:29.480 --> 40:30.480]  right there.
[40:30.480 --> 40:34.480]  It's like you look at Brian Steltzer and you go, that's an evil son of a bitch.
[40:34.480 --> 40:39.200]  Now we've got a longer segment, the longest segment of the hour is coming up.
[40:39.200 --> 40:45.120]  I'm going to come back and get into the victory because I can talk about how they operate
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.200]  and how they work all day, but I mean, it's a fact that until about 14 years ago, really
[40:50.200 --> 40:56.040]  12 years ago, the media, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, they would get up
[40:56.040 --> 41:00.360]  on television and in the newspaper and say, there is no Bilderberg group.
[41:00.360 --> 41:01.640]  It doesn't exist.
[41:01.640 --> 41:08.360]  Alex Jones and Jim Tucker are insane and Daniel Estolin are insane.
[41:08.360 --> 41:13.000]  New York Times article saying Jones was in Virginia at the Santilli Hotel Complex believing
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.920]  there was a meeting and just imagining men in suits and dark glasses and earpieces.
[41:18.920 --> 41:19.920]  Have it all on videos.
[41:19.920 --> 41:20.920]  Bilderberg, they were there.
[41:20.920 --> 41:23.200]  Klopp the King of Spain coming in, all of it.
[41:23.200 --> 41:26.280]  Got 35-millimeter photos of it all here.
[41:26.280 --> 41:27.960]  You're looking at it right here.
[41:27.960 --> 41:29.080]  We got photos in Europe.
[41:29.080 --> 41:30.920]  We got photos in the U.S. and Canada.
[41:30.920 --> 41:31.920]  We've been everywhere.
[41:31.920 --> 41:36.400]  We even got photos of their name tags.
[41:36.400 --> 41:39.840]  These are photos we got that you're seeing on TV screen right now.
[41:39.840 --> 41:42.440]  There's the Queen of the Netherlands.
[41:42.440 --> 41:47.760]  Those are photos we took.
[41:47.760 --> 41:49.760]  That's photos from our film.
[41:49.760 --> 41:50.760]  Took that.
[41:50.760 --> 41:56.800]  One of my crew took that at 250 yards, the long lens.
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.440]  Wolfson, former head of the World Bank.
[42:02.440 --> 42:08.800]  And the list goes on and on and on and on and imagine the media being so evil they tell
[42:08.800 --> 42:10.760]  you this group doesn't even exist.
[42:10.760 --> 42:14.440]  Well, I'm going to explain to you when we come back how they run their minions, how
[42:14.440 --> 42:19.240]  they control their operations, who their alumni are and how we stop them.
[42:19.240 --> 42:21.520]  We're going to go to break and come back with that.
[42:21.520 --> 42:24.560]  Please don't forget, their operation is the great reset.
[42:24.560 --> 42:27.240]  Our operation to respond is reset wars.
[42:27.240 --> 42:32.440]  We're going to truly reset ourselves to defeat their false reset and we break down the secrets
[42:32.440 --> 42:33.440]  they don't want you to know.
[42:33.440 --> 42:36.280]  Folks, if you want to support the broadcast and be part of the most important work we've
[42:36.280 --> 42:39.960]  done and keep us on air, but also get incredible information that will power you and your family
[42:39.960 --> 42:45.800]  and friends, then be part of our first two course, six plus hour presentation at reset
[42:45.800 --> 42:46.800]  wars.
[42:46.800 --> 42:47.800]  It's now live.
[42:47.800 --> 42:48.800]  You can now go watch it.
[42:48.800 --> 42:51.240]  You can now get the course at resetwars.com.
[42:51.240 --> 42:57.240]  And until tomorrow at 1159 p.m. central, you can get 25% off at resetwars.com.
[42:57.240 --> 42:59.240]  Thank you for your support.
[42:59.240 --> 43:04.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.720]  I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[43:08.720 --> 43:13.440]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[43:13.440 --> 43:16.000]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.480]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[43:19.480 --> 43:20.760]  but really they're just a commune.
[43:20.760 --> 43:23.800]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[43:23.800 --> 43:25.960]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[43:25.960 --> 43:29.160]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[43:29.160 --> 43:30.360]  and the price has never gone up.
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.760]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[43:34.760 --> 43:37.240]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[43:37.240 --> 43:41.440]  Let's wake up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[43:41.440 --> 43:48.920]  not going to tell you a little story, we had like that, okay, do you want to believe it?
[43:48.920 --> 43:53.440]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[43:53.440 --> 43:56.440]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[43:56.440 --> 44:06.160]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[44:06.160 --> 44:10.680]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out and they're doing that not because
[44:10.680 --> 44:16.240]  we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful and
[44:16.240 --> 44:19.480]  the social engineers fear that so much.
[44:19.480 --> 44:23.320]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[44:23.320 --> 44:27.120]  with the boy, is it true?
[44:27.120 --> 44:32.960]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.720]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[44:36.720 --> 44:43.400]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[44:43.400 --> 44:45.200]  of this world who is a loser.
[44:45.200 --> 44:49.600]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever
[44:49.600 --> 44:53.560]  because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[44:53.560 --> 44:58.360]  up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they
[44:58.360 --> 45:01.360]  just announced.
[45:01.360 --> 45:06.400]  I want to explain something that is absolutely seed understanding our world that's very simple
[45:06.400 --> 45:08.400]  but the most people don't know.
[45:08.400 --> 45:15.120]  The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions
[45:15.120 --> 45:21.680]  of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure, intellectual
[45:21.680 --> 45:28.360]  property, energy, they're using it to buy people, to buy influence and in the past they
[45:28.360 --> 45:33.040]  created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulated market so
[45:33.040 --> 45:37.080]  they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause
[45:37.080 --> 45:38.080]  massive inflation.
[45:38.080 --> 45:43.200]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[45:43.200 --> 45:49.160]  buying up everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down and
[45:49.160 --> 45:53.720]  force the collapse of civilization making the companies they do fund be the only things
[45:53.720 --> 45:54.720]  left standing.
[45:54.720 --> 45:59.600]  This is what's happening now, warn everyone, it's the only way to stop it.
[45:59.600 --> 46:06.360]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[46:06.360 --> 46:11.800]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[46:11.800 --> 46:15.880]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[46:15.880 --> 46:19.160]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[46:19.160 --> 46:20.160]  have.
[46:20.160 --> 46:23.040]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[46:23.040 --> 46:26.920]  filtration, self defense and a relationship with God.
[46:26.920 --> 46:31.280]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders in now, we're ready to
[46:31.280 --> 46:35.920]  ship to you within 24 hours of your order, it's high quality, it's very very low cost
[46:35.920 --> 46:41.480]  at infowarstore.com because in the future you're going to see more food supply shortages and
[46:41.480 --> 46:45.080]  you're going to see food supply price increases that are already taking place.
[46:45.080 --> 46:51.400]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[46:51.400 --> 46:55.240]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[46:55.240 --> 46:56.240]  control.
[46:56.240 --> 47:01.760]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[47:01.760 --> 47:08.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:08.760 --> 47:33.760]  Where are the clowns, send in the clowns, just when I stopped, opening doors, finally
[47:33.760 --> 47:51.760]  knowing the one that I wanted was yours, making my entrance again with my usual flair.
[47:51.760 --> 48:21.560]  The core of my lines, no one is there, don't you love the farce, my fault I fear.
[48:21.560 --> 48:28.560]  The clowns, all right let me do this, let me cut right to the chase.
[48:28.560 --> 48:31.960]  Hiding in plain view, and I've known this, we've written articles about it, I've made
[48:31.960 --> 48:37.760]  films about it, I've explained it, but it's hiding in plain view and I forget that stuff
[48:37.760 --> 48:43.040]  we covered 20 years ago or 10 years ago or 5 years ago needs to be covered again, especially
[48:43.040 --> 48:47.820]  since the Bilderberg group, that's the main consortium, has launched its attack through
[48:47.820 --> 48:55.200]  its public spokesperson arm, the Deboce group, that it uses to recruit sub-puppet organizations
[48:55.200 --> 48:56.200]  that it controls.
[48:56.200 --> 49:03.920]  The best description of it is a private, corporate, combine that uses governmental intelligence
[49:03.920 --> 49:11.240]  agency warfare tactics of infiltration, espionage, sex ops, you name it for control.
[49:11.240 --> 49:15.160]  And that's what Jeffrey Epstein was a part of, with thousands of girls at a time under
[49:15.160 --> 49:21.000]  age corrupting men, how do you take over a whole society?
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.040]  How people go against their own best interest, you set them up and you blackmail them, that's
[49:25.040 --> 49:30.240]  why most of the girls Epstein got weren't 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old, they were 15 but
[49:30.240 --> 49:35.040]  look like they were 20, so they can set these men up and blackmail them and control them,
[49:35.040 --> 49:39.360]  that's how they get control of the blue cities.
[49:39.360 --> 49:43.800]  So when you see a blue city, that's an area they've gotten control of and now you look
[49:43.800 --> 49:49.200]  at Europe and you look at much of Africa and Asia and Latin America, it's all been taken
[49:49.200 --> 49:54.640]  over by them and their party is the build back better, great reset party and they tell
[49:54.640 --> 50:00.160]  you where would the build back better, where would the great reset and they tell you everything's
[50:00.160 --> 50:06.880]  about to be free, your healthcare, your tuition, your transportation, your home, yeah because
[50:06.880 --> 50:11.040]  you're going to be starving to death, you're going to have nothing, you're going to be
[50:11.040 --> 50:16.200]  free to sleep on the street until you get a disease and die, well they're going to build
[50:16.200 --> 50:23.600]  back better alright and people don't ask where's this build back better come from, where's
[50:23.600 --> 50:27.320]  the Republican leadership who I think Ted Cruz is a good person, I know Rand Paul's
[50:27.320 --> 50:33.760]  a good person, Josh Holly, Tom Cotton, they all seem like good men, Devin Nunes is going
[50:33.760 --> 50:38.480]  to work for Trump, run his social network, Jim Jordan, okay guys can we even say the
[50:38.480 --> 50:41.960]  name of the team we're fighting, can we even talk about who's running all this, can we
[50:41.960 --> 50:49.320]  even discuss them, but again it's like when Fiona Hill who brought in all the globalists
[50:49.320 --> 50:52.920]  in the Trump's administration, we exposed her 2017 all hell broke loose, all the lawsuits
[50:52.920 --> 50:56.160]  started all the attacks because we were exposing their takeover and they were trying to derail
[50:56.160 --> 51:00.200]  what Trump did and they successfully did it, we almost beat them just because we actually
[51:00.200 --> 51:07.920]  researched, we're not heroes, we're supposed to be slaves and she came out and said Alex
[51:07.920 --> 51:13.840]  Jones to Congress, she said Alex Jones lied, I don't know what a globalist is and she goes
[51:13.840 --> 51:19.640]  I'm not a socialist, I'm not even a liberal, Fiona Hill was the head of George Soros's
[51:19.640 --> 51:29.880]  foundation for nine years, not just on the board, she headed it up, Fiona Hill is the
[51:29.880 --> 51:35.840]  chief writer at TheGlobalist.com, so again that's like saying the Dallas Cowboys don't
[51:35.840 --> 51:44.960]  have a silver baby blue helmet with a navy blue star, the Cowboys aren't based in Dallas
[51:44.960 --> 51:52.920]  either and Texas isn't based in Texas, the level of lies is just stratospheric, so I've
[51:52.920 --> 51:57.520]  been on air 28 years and I got woken up by General Benton K. Parton, former head of Air
[51:57.520 --> 52:00.960]  Force Weapons Development who ran the secret space program, Harp and everything else, I
[52:00.960 --> 52:06.240]  think he's a pretty good source and Ted Gunderson who was tapped to be the FBI director but
[52:06.240 --> 52:11.000]  he was too conservative, former head of the LA division of the FBI, a good guy, a great
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.600]  guy and I'll tell you when I was 20 years old and heard him talking like this at events
[52:15.600 --> 52:19.360]  I went and saw him speak at, right as I was getting on air but he helped get me on air
[52:19.360 --> 52:25.640]  by encouraging me, I thought this guy really seems crazy but a lot of what he's telling
[52:25.640 --> 52:29.520]  me, my family's told me and I've read in history books so I know a lot of what he's
[52:29.520 --> 52:33.880]  saying is true and I can't disprove any of it and now decades later every damn thing
[52:33.880 --> 52:37.920]  he told me was true, he was dead on a real American.
[52:37.920 --> 52:42.920]  So let me tell you something, I am so blessed, it was God doing this, that I grew up with
[52:42.920 --> 52:47.000]  an uncle who'd been in Iran, Contra and that they tried to recruit my dad in their whole
[52:47.000 --> 52:51.360]  eugenics operation, he got recruited for a while but got out of it and that then I got
[52:51.360 --> 52:56.420]  to run into General Parton and all those people and I got to learn from the best patriots
[52:56.420 --> 53:02.840]  in America how things were really operating and what was really going on.
[53:02.840 --> 53:07.520]  And now here we are ladies and gentlemen and it is a global private corporate crime syndicate,
[53:07.520 --> 53:11.080]  oh my gosh I didn't go to the Gregory's report yet, I think there's still time, go to the
[53:11.080 --> 53:38.840]  Gregory's report on this, here it is.
[53:38.840 --> 53:44.760]  Wolf has been researching the history of Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum and has
[53:44.760 --> 53:51.600]  found a very fundamental piece of their criminal puzzle, the young global leaders school established
[53:51.600 --> 53:54.480]  and managed by Klaus Schwab.
[53:54.480 --> 54:00.520]  The World Economic Forum, originally called the European Management Forum, brought together
[54:00.520 --> 54:08.160]  31 nations at its very first meeting in 1971 and is currently funded by a thousand multinational
[54:08.160 --> 54:09.960]  corporations.
[54:09.960 --> 54:15.320]  Klaus Schwab hadn't really accomplished much in economics, his father made weapons for
[54:15.320 --> 54:20.600]  the Nazis and he trained under Henry Kissinger at the Harvard Business School which is where
[54:20.600 --> 54:25.040]  he was likely tapped to be the face of the World Economic Forum.
[54:25.040 --> 54:31.760]  In 1992 Schwab established the Global Leaders for Tomorrow School which was re-established
[54:31.760 --> 54:35.880]  as the young global leaders in 2004.
[54:35.880 --> 54:41.120]  These must officially apply for admission and be selected, alumni of the school's very
[54:41.120 --> 54:48.680]  first class include Angela Merkel, Nicholas Sarkozy and Tony Blair.
[54:48.680 --> 54:56.120]  Other attendees include Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, the Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda
[54:56.120 --> 54:57.120]  Ardern.
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.520]  So long as there's people who are eligible who haven't been vaccinated we've got work
[55:00.520 --> 55:01.520]  to do.
[55:01.520 --> 55:04.280]  You know I don't think I'll ever be satisfied so long as there's someone who's choose,
[55:04.280 --> 55:08.160]  you know, who is eligible who hasn't been and that's why I've said this but it's not
[55:08.160 --> 55:11.120]  going to be an end point to this vaccination program.
[55:11.120 --> 55:16.760]  President of France Emmanuel Macron, Governor of California Gavin Newsom.
[55:16.760 --> 55:20.480]  That's why we recognize our responsibility to do more and that's what we are announcing
[55:20.480 --> 55:29.640]  here today, a statewide requirement for in-person instruction for all of our children to add
[55:29.640 --> 55:35.560]  to a well-established list that currently includes 10 vaccinations and well-established
[55:35.560 --> 55:41.920]  rules and regulations that have been advanced by the legislature for decades to add to
[55:41.920 --> 55:43.920]  that list the vaccination.
[55:43.920 --> 55:48.720]  U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.
[55:48.720 --> 55:54.360]  Other attendees of the young global leaders include Virgins Richard Branson, the Clinton
[55:54.360 --> 55:59.800]  Foundation's Chelsea Clinton and Black Rock's Larry Fink.
[55:59.800 --> 56:07.680]  Approximately 1,300 global leaders have attended the school from North America, Asia, Africa
[56:07.680 --> 56:14.600]  and South America, most of whom are all pushing the same criminal hoax, the lockdowns and
[56:14.600 --> 56:17.760]  the deadly experimental jabs.
[56:17.760 --> 56:22.680]  These are the foot soldiers bringing about the angry world that Klaus Schwab talked about.
[56:22.680 --> 56:29.400]  I don't know how it will play out in November, but what we know is that we will end up with
[56:29.400 --> 56:36.240]  many more unemployed and particularly also people in the gray economy which are not
[56:36.240 --> 56:39.040]  counted for who lose their jobs.
[56:39.040 --> 56:47.160]  So we will see definitely a lot of anger already now, but probably increased by the end of
[56:47.160 --> 56:54.760]  this year because this crisis will be with us until we really have found remedy.
[56:54.760 --> 57:00.720]  So we have to prepare for a more angry world so that his masters can bring about their
[57:00.720 --> 57:03.240]  one-world government system.
[57:03.240 --> 57:09.500]  And in 2012, Klaus Schwab began the global shapers community which has groomed an army
[57:09.500 --> 57:15.800]  of 10,000 young people to be the next group of saboteurs around the world, currently holding
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.040]  meetings in 400 cities worldwide.
[57:20.040 --> 57:22.320]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[57:22.320 --> 57:28.300]  And again, that's the British Royal Round Table Group model that became our CFR.
[57:28.300 --> 57:30.240]  This is another model of it out of the Bilderberg Group.
[57:30.240 --> 57:34.440]  This is the most powerful elite group of them and you can see all the master criminals they've
[57:34.440 --> 57:35.440]  got in place.
[57:35.440 --> 57:38.840]  They also train and control the major pedophile rings, all of it.
[57:38.840 --> 57:41.680]  And they're now seeing unlimited shots forever.
[57:41.680 --> 57:44.020]  You'll never be properly vaccinated until you're dead.
[57:44.020 --> 57:45.840]  They are a eugenicist death cult.
[57:45.840 --> 57:48.680]  They are the people that the Nazis wished they were.
[57:48.680 --> 57:53.960]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[57:53.960 --> 57:59.280]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[57:59.280 --> 58:01.800]  Well, that's why ReesetWars.com is so important.
[58:01.800 --> 58:07.640]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[58:07.640 --> 58:14.760]  it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[58:14.760 --> 58:16.960]  and American jobs.
[58:16.960 --> 58:19.240]  It is the true digital economy.
[58:19.240 --> 58:24.280]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[58:24.280 --> 58:30.120]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[58:30.120 --> 58:34.920]  divine empowerment and blessing, but I got to tell you out of everything I've done, ReesetWars
[58:34.920 --> 58:41.080]  is the most important and it is now available now at the month of December 20, 2021 is here
[58:41.080 --> 58:43.240]  at ReesetWars.com.
[58:43.240 --> 58:48.760]  Start your journey to the next level today at ReesetWars.com, the globalist fear this
[58:48.760 --> 58:49.760]  information.
[58:49.760 --> 58:56.760]  Come to command here with an important message to humanity.
[58:56.760 --> 59:03.760]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe,
[59:03.760 --> 59:12.760]  but the injection is not ready yet and so I need all of you to stay indoors for the
[59:12.760 --> 59:17.080]  next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[59:17.080 --> 59:25.240]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[59:25.240 --> 59:32.160]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[59:32.160 --> 59:35.560]  only I own profitable.
[59:35.560 --> 59:42.760]  You will then be my slaves, old and then you get that special shot of freedom from Cobra.
[59:42.760 --> 59:48.240]  It will remove your immune system so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable
[59:48.240 --> 59:51.520]  lives.
[59:51.520 --> 1:00:06.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:12.080]  After decades of intense research, our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:14.840]  bonds is now life.
[1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:18.000]  The reset wars have begun.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:26.800]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:29.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, reset wars is now live.
[1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:34.160]  You can see the course Mind Wars Spirit War now.
[1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:39.720]  Game changing, most powerful info I've ever released at resetwars.com.
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:45.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very, very special guest that's going to be
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:51.600]  joining us coming up in the next segment to deal with COVID-19 and everything that has
[1:00:51.600 --> 1:00:55.200]  been unfolding since then.
[1:00:55.200 --> 1:01:01.760]  But I wanted to spend a few minutes here in this segment speaking to you about what I'm
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:05.320]  going to cover in the third hour today.
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:10.280]  And that deals with the January 6 committee and what's happening there and how they're
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:16.600]  trying to act like Republican Congress people sending text messages to Trump saying ask
[1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:22.080]  the people to stop attacking the building, CNN, ABC News, NBC News, they're all saying
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:26.200]  this is proof that Trump ordered an attack on the Capitol.
[1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:28.920]  No, most people were following him on Twitter.
[1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:32.000]  He had 80 million plus Twitter followers.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.800]  And so people were telling him once it started, he was speaking when it started.
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:39.200]  It was going on for an hour while he spoke.
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:43.000]  They started it right while he was speaking so they could claim, they had provocateurs
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.840]  there we now know, that he didn't try to help.
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:50.960]  As soon as he gets off, drives to the White House a few minutes away, he's getting the
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:56.480]  phone calls and he then put out tweets saying be peaceful, leave the building, don't be there.
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:03.000]  But they're acting like because his son Don Jr. and a bunch of Republican congressmen and
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.960]  others were telling his chief of staff, hey, tell the president, tell people get out of
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:07.960]  the building.
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:10.080]  This is really going to hurt everything we've done.
[1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:12.280]  We want a 10-day investigation by the Senate.
[1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:13.280]  We had the votes.
[1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:16.520]  This is horrible.
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:19.640]  Which again, ladies and gentlemen, is the motive.
[1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:22.400]  You don't have a motive when you're about to have a 10-day investigation by the Senate
[1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:25.200]  to go attack the Capitol and make yourself look bad.
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:31.040]  So they're trying to spin this right now.
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.640]  They're trying to spin all of this right now as if it's proof.
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:37.440]  So that's what they do with every piece of information they get.
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:45.920]  Oh my gosh, there's text messages on Mark Meadows, his chief of staff's phone that he
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:53.520]  gave them, where the Republicans are trying to stop everything.
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:58.680]  And then they turn that around and act like, oh, see, it's proof that Trump was in command
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:01.240]  because why would you ask him to stop it if he wasn't in command?
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:02.240]  That's ridiculous.
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:04.600]  It's like calling the fire department to come put a fire out.
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:06.480]  They didn't start the fire, but you call the fire department.
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:12.160]  Who had a better chance to electronically tell the 600 people out of a million that were
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:15.560]  foolish enough to go inside to turn back?
[1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:18.480]  Only Donald Trump had that megaphone.
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:23.680]  And it took him 30 minutes from the time he was asked to do it.
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:26.000]  He definitely wanted to watch it, wanted to know what was happening.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.400]  A little bit of a slow response, I'll give you that.
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:31.400]  But that's it.
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:32.800]  Obviously he wouldn't blow his feet off.
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:34.080]  Obviously he wouldn't want this.
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:35.680]  This destroyed Trump at that level.
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:36.680]  It totally hurt him.
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:42.280]  So I'll be talking about that some more because I've gotten these subpoenas, not subpoena,
[1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:43.280]  subpoenas.
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:50.880]  It's three subpoenas now from the House Committee on Un-American Activities, part two.
[1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:57.040]  And I know that whatever I turn over, I turn stuff over to him, will be twisted and misrepresented.
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:03.680]  Now, I got there and within five minutes of me being there and seeing flash bangs and
[1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:09.360]  attacks and smoke and people climbing on the Capitol and going in, I was on top of a big
[1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:12.400]  pallet of chairs that hadn't been unfolded yet.
[1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:15.880]  I was up on a big pallet, the highest place I could find, saying, get down, stop, come
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:17.080]  down.
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:20.080]  And that was the five minutes it took me to get through the crowd of hundreds of thousands
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:24.040]  up closer to the Capitol, and then our guys are trying to get cell service going, what's
[1:04:24.040 --> 1:04:25.040]  going on?
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:26.040]  Well, they say they've reached the Capitol.
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:28.120]  They're like, get up, get out of there.
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:29.120]  Don't do it.
[1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:30.640]  Don't be part of this.
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:37.320]  Even PR is running pieces, so is the New York Times saying that I was cowardly there commanding
[1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:38.640]  people to break in.
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:42.240]  They're still doing that, despite the video, because they don't care, because they're
[1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:47.040]  criminal organizations working with the great reset and Klaus Schwab to bring down this
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:48.040]  country.
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:51.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very special surprise guest coming up next
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:52.320]  segment.
[1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:53.320]  You'll definitely want to stay with us.
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:05:03.600]  We'll be right back in full wars.com everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:08.800]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:11.400]  Well, that's why reset wars.com is so important.
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:17.280]  Not only is it a game changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:24.400]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:26.600]  and American jobs.
[1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:28.880]  It is the true digital economy.
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:33.920]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control.
[1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:38.000]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:42.080]  Thanks to God and God's divine empowerment and blessing.
[1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:46.280]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, reset wars is the most important and
[1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:52.880]  it is now available out of the month of December, 2021 is here at reset wars.com.
[1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:56.800]  Start your journey to the next level today and reset wars.com.
[1:05:56.800 --> 1:06:08.600]  The globalist fear this information live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:31.880]  This is Alex Jones, well, I really appreciate our next guest because out of the hundreds
[1:06:31.880 --> 1:06:36.840]  of amazing doctors and scientists that we've interviewed, she is right up there in the
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:44.040]  top three or so, probably number one, and she's so prodigiously successful at waking
[1:06:44.040 --> 1:06:49.640]  people up and traveling around and doing interviews on top of the hard work she does.
[1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:54.440]  Dr. Lee Merritt, I'm not going to go over her whole medical doctor background, but we
[1:06:54.440 --> 1:07:03.400]  really appreciate her coming on the broadcast today to go over what's happening, themedicalrebel.com.
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:11.000]  And there are so many big developments, obviously, Biden officials warned COVID explosion imminent.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:15.720]  That's the same PR by the Bilderberg Group, Davos Group around the world, new lockdowns
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:19.400]  coming in January, I'm told by my FEMA and military connections.
[1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:22.280]  COVID is a deadly pandemic.
[1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:28.600]  It killed science, logic, evidence-based medicine, and common sense, says Dr. Eli David.
[1:07:28.600 --> 1:07:34.880]  WHO warns of COVID tsunami before Christmas, California brings back statewide mass main
[1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:40.640]  date in all indoor spaces after COVID cases skyrocket, or is it really cases of people
[1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:41.840]  that have had the shot that are sick?
[1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:42.840]  We now know that.
[1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:47.000]  I thought you're safe if you've had the shot.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:50.320]  We'll need to get COVID-19 vaccine boosters forever.
[1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:55.760]  That's in the Globe and Mail, and that's in CNN, and that's in today.com, NBC.
[1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:56.880]  It's just everywhere.
[1:07:56.880 --> 1:07:58.360]  Now it's forever.
[1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:04.320]  The worst part of the first 15 days to flatten the curve is the first two years.
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:09.320]  Aussie Prime Minister compares the vaccinated to sheep, calls them good sheep.
[1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:13.720]  Elon Musk says, I am against forcing people to be vaccinated, not something we should
[1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:14.720]  do in America.
[1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:20.840]  InfoWars has the article, Elon Musk, Person of the Year, Radicalized by Lockdowns.
[1:08:20.840 --> 1:08:27.440]  Maybe somebody else reports FDA accused of colluding with USPS to stop and destroy packages
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:29.080]  of ivermectin mailed to patients.
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:30.680]  That's now confirmed.
[1:08:30.680 --> 1:08:34.360]  Criminal beyond Nuremberg Crimes.
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:39.280]  Unvaccinated people shouldn't reproduce, declares Winterfest announcer.
[1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:43.280]  Build Back Better, a game changer for early childhood education.
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:44.720]  Got some news on that.
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:48.920]  UK government refuses to reveal details about first Omnicron death.
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:52.320]  Oh, it goes on and on and on.
[1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:57.720]  Dr. Lee Merritt joins us to cover a host of issues, she's going to give us a preview
[1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:59.680]  of those and then dive right into them.
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:01.960]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming back with us.
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:03.560]  Thanks for having me.
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:08.280]  It's probably been six months since you were on, seems like a million years, so much has
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:10.920]  happened but also five seconds ago at the same time.
[1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:14.080]  Where do you want to start first?
[1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:15.080]  I don't know.
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:19.520]  We're living in such a theater of the absurd, it's a target-rich environment, you know.
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:25.560]  I mean, you know, your point about ivermectin, keep in mind the FDA has told the Postal Service
[1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:29.520]  to interdict ivermectin at the border, destroy the packages.
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:34.240]  This is a drug that the WHO has on its list of most essential drugs.
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:35.740]  Are you kidding me?
[1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:41.320]  And it's clearly, one of the largest studies or the largest study I think was just published
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:50.440]  from Brazil, 220,000 adults and ivermectin decreased the risk of going down with this
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:54.880]  by I think depth and going to hospital by 50%.
[1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:56.480]  So it just goes on and on.
[1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:00.240]  I mean, there's lots of people that don't think there's peer-reviewed studies, there's
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:03.200]  peer-reviewed studies, there's unpure-reviewed studies.
[1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:04.200]  It's everywhere.
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:09.480]  Yeah, I mean, I wish the USPS would try to stop the fentanyl killing millions of people
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:12.000]  but I guess they're not going to do that, a totally safe drug.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.960]  They're not going to let evil Americans order that from outside countries even if a doctor
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:17.960]  prescribes it.
[1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:18.960]  Right.
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:23.200]  And I told somebody jokingly, but it's actually kind of true because they can't get it anywhere
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:24.200]  else.
[1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:25.680]  It's hard to order it from overseas pharmacies.
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:29.840]  I've been contacted by one of them and they had all of their packages have been stopped.
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:30.840]  They can't bring them in.
[1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:32.680]  So this has confirmed multiple ways.
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:37.360]  But you know, we think of meals bringing cocaine across the border, now you can bring ivermectin
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:38.640]  and probably make a fortune.
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:39.640]  Isn't that sad?
[1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:40.640]  Absolutely.
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:44.640]  I mean, that's a great example, Doc, and please continue.
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:47.280]  Well, I was going to say, it doesn't stop here.
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:49.260]  I was just speaking in Ohio.
[1:10:49.260 --> 1:10:55.480]  In the great state of Ohio, doctors cannot prescribe azithromycin and doxycycline without
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:58.040]  worried about somebody looking at their license.
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:01.040]  So they don't give more than one or two days for people.
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:05.680]  I said to a doctor there, I said, are you telling me we can't treat acne anymore with
[1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:09.960]  doxycycline or azithromycin for a sinus infection?
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:10.960]  Are you kidding me?
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:12.160]  And that's where they've gone.
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:14.160]  Because so it isn't about the drug.
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:17.920]  It's about they don't want us to save people, apparently.
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:19.560]  I can't come up with another reason.
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:24.200]  Why would you prohibit drugs that we've used for literally for 60 years?
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:26.680]  Because suddenly they've been shown to be useful for this.
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:27.680]  Well, that's right.
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:32.360]  I mean, Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates said they want to depopulate us and it doesn't matter
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:37.200]  what all the science shows, it doesn't matter what the facts show, this is about these corporations
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:40.880]  through big tech and through the media and through agencies of government having total
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:41.880]  control.
[1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:43.280]  So docs, slow down and repeat that.
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:44.280]  That's the big news.
[1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:48.040]  And I know I've seen that in the news confirming what you're saying, that some areas of the
[1:11:48.040 --> 1:11:53.760]  United States are now trying to block basic antibiotics for people that have lung infections.
[1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:55.720]  I mean, this is beyond criminal.
[1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:56.720]  Right.
[1:11:56.720 --> 1:12:02.200]  And it's in Ohio, it was azithromycin and doxycycline.
[1:12:02.200 --> 1:12:04.920]  Now we've used doxycycline for a lot of things.
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:09.880]  So it's a very safe drug and it's been used for, like dermatology used it.
[1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:14.400]  I took it multiple times for acne rosacea in my life.
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:15.400]  Come on.
[1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:20.600]  It's not a, this isn't controversial, but there's a hold on it.
[1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:23.760]  Now I will say this for people out there going to pharmacies.
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:26.320]  This is the reason to use independent pharmacies.
[1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:31.040]  The good news about independent pharmacies where the government's not getting too involved,
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:36.160]  they still will, they still will give out ivermectin and hydroxychloric one and, and
[1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:40.760]  these things, but you go to one of the chains and they've been told from on high not to
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:41.760]  prescribe it.
[1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:50.000]  Even in states like mine, where I practice where there's no prohibition on using ivermectin.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.680]  So time to support your local pharmacies.
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:54.200]  That's a big deal right now.
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:58.200]  And again, it's Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the UN.
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:02.200]  Whatever medical doctors or US senators who are medical doctors like Rand Paul, try to
[1:13:02.200 --> 1:13:06.440]  give a speech about natural immunity being 27 times better than this Pfizer shot.
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:10.640]  They censor him on Google and YouTube and the Senate just puts up with that.
[1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:15.280]  I mean, imagine the level of this control of telling doctors what they can prescribe
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:18.200]  and telling senators what they can say.
[1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:19.200]  Yeah.
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:23.400]  I mean, the censorship isn't science.
[1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:28.160]  And so we need to realize that it isn't been, you know, I, I've started reading
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:32.440]  more about the tab of stock than about medicine these days, because what we're dealing with
[1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:36.480]  is a huge mass mind control propaganda outbreak.
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:38.400]  We're not really dealing with a viral outbreak.
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:40.480]  It's, it's taking us down.
[1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:41.480]  It's been acting.
[1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:45.920]  We've been, we've been under the impression that we could speak freely about medicine
[1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:49.800]  for a long time, but it turns out it hasn't been true for a long time.
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:54.560]  The notion, I'll just point out that one of the couple things got us here.
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:14:00.600]  One was Obamacare, which made it so difficult for private physicians to act, you know, as
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:05.040]  independent physicians that because of all the regulation that they sold out to hospitals.
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:10.120]  So now when it was seven, before that 70 some percent of doctors were independent.
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:13.560]  Now they all work for hospitals and the hospitals are controlled.
[1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:17.360]  But the other thing that we've been victim of is this idea that the only thing to listen
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:21.160]  to we've taught all the new, new medical students and everybody.
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:25.920]  The only thing we can listen to is a 30 year double blind peer reviewed study.
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:30.800]  You know, peer review is the Politburo attached to medicine and science.
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:34.760]  You have three or five people on the top of some journal.
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:38.960]  I have my own experience with this in, in my profession.
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:42.360]  And they decide whether or not something gets published or not.
[1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:47.640]  Now admittedly there should be some kind of screening for some quality of, of, you know,
[1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:49.200]  language or whatever.
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:52.760]  But when you have a few people that decides on the basis of, for example, I had it one
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:56.880]  time I had a publication that was submitted and the response I got from one of the reviewers
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:14:58.960]  was everyone knows you can't do this.
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:03.160]  It was about a surgical procedure, but I thought that was a funny review after I spent a lot
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:07.440]  of time and money and energy putting together a very quality paper.
[1:15:07.440 --> 1:15:09.760]  Everyone knows you can't do this.
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:14.040]  If you don't follow the narrative, then the peer reviewers don't publish.
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:18.480]  And if, and the narrative can be controlled by funding the peer reviewers.
[1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:19.680]  That's pretty easy.
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:24.240]  You know, look at what Pfizer, you've probably seen that video that all these news reports
[1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:28.080]  funded by Pfizer, you know, brought to you by Pfizer.
[1:15:28.080 --> 1:15:29.080]  It's just on and on.
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:32.760]  So that's a total conflict of interest on its face, but they just ignore that.
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:33.760]  Now Dr. Merritt stay there.
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:38.480]  We're going to come back in the next segment and, and speaking of them manipulating reviews
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:43.360]  and studies, we now know that Pfizer did indeed do that and they tried to block and now they
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:49.360]  want 75 years till it gets released, but the first group of that or Tronsh came out and
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:53.000]  it was confirming everything you and others warned about over a year ago.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.280]  We'll be right back with Dr. Lee Merritt stay with us.
[1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:02.600]  What if you could get our great bag of it here?
[1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:06.840]  I mean, this is from people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communist?
[1:16:06.840 --> 1:16:12.080]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:14.640]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:18.440]  And yeah, we buy from the little farmers that the media calls communist, but really they're
[1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:19.440]  just a commune.
[1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:22.400]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:24.560]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:16:24.560 --> 1:16:27.960]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and
[1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:28.960]  the price has never gone up.
[1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:33.400]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:35.880]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:40.280]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally in fact, I'm not
[1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:47.080]  going to tell you a little story, um, we have like the, I'm not saying you wouldn't believe
[1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:48.080]  it.
[1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:52.040]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:58.680]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:00.040]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:01.960]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:02.960]  Welcome.
[1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:03.960]  Hello, Alex.
[1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:04.960]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:05.960]  All right.
[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:07.960]  I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:12.760]  Well, Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, Super
[1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:15.720]  Mel Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[1:17:15.720 --> 1:17:16.720]  Mix those two together.
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:18.240]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:20.240]  Super Mel Vitality really, really works.
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:25.200]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:17:25.200 --> 1:17:30.880]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well,
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:31.880]  but just aren't as strong.
[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:33.760]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:36.200]  It's, it's, it's, in fact, each batch is different.
[1:17:36.200 --> 1:17:38.240]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just OK.
[1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:41.680]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:42.680]  That's just how it is.
[1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:43.680]  It's how it works.
[1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:45.840]  Uh, so it's always good.
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:47.680]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:58.200]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:03.000]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the Globalist.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.040]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:10.720]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:11.720]  But we failed.
[1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:13.200]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:18.960]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:21.320]  deindustrialization great reset.
[1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:25.640]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:30.240]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:33.160]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda.
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:36.920]  We've also got to get personally prepared and one of the number one things to do is
[1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:38.120]  high quality, storeable food.
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:43.120]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:57.960]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:57.960 --> 1:19:00.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.

[1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:08.520]  that no one else will touch.

[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:28.840]  And you know, I'm telling you the vitamin D gummies, this is a great thing for your
[1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:29.840]  kids.
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:30.840]  They love it.
[1:19:30.840 --> 1:19:31.840]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:32.840]  It's healthy.
[1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:34.480]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:36.080]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:38.640]  I think I think for kids that'd be great.
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:44.080]  Calcium good for them, the vitamin D. So that's at infowarstore.com.

[1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:07.800]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:23.480]  All right, Dr. Lee Merritt is our guest here and I really appreciate coming on the Alex
[1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:29.200]  Jones show on this Tuesday, December 14th broadcast and it reminded me of why I think
[1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:32.400]  she's one of the most articulate best people we've got out there fighting this tyranny
[1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:37.400]  is she goes to the big picture and I wanted to get the nuts and bolts of where we are
[1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:41.000]  and what's coming next and I'm the crown and the rest of it.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:45.720]  But you talked about Tabistock Institute, but those that don't know MI6 connected behavioral
[1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:50.720]  psychology outfit and the fact that they admit they hired militaries around the world with
[1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:55.560]  the Tabistock Institute to engage in fear mongering and even use terms like brainwashing.
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:56.560]  This isn't our opinion.
[1:20:56.560 --> 1:21:01.520]  This is MKUltra stuff on the mass scale and so you're a medical doctor speaking about
[1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:02.520]  that.
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:06.480]  What is the big picture and is it the way to beat this not to argue every point of their
[1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:13.520]  lies and every new variant, but to argue the fact of their using this for their global
[1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:18.080]  government takeover, the build back better, great reset?
[1:21:18.080 --> 1:21:19.200]  I think so.
[1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:23.800]  You can get down in the weeds and get lost and I think the point here is, I mean just
[1:21:23.800 --> 1:21:30.040]  looking at these variants, the guy without being prejudiced and confused by an inadequate
[1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:35.840]  medical or scientific education that we were all given, you just look at this and you say,
[1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:36.840]  is this really crazy?
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:37.840]  I mean, come on.
[1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:38.840]  Can they make up?
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:40.920]  This sounds like a made up story.
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:45.440]  We've got all these countries that are highly vaccinated that are having the highest rate
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:46.440]  of outbreak.
[1:21:46.440 --> 1:21:52.600]  On the other hand, the lowest countries like they come out with a news story saying South
[1:21:52.600 --> 1:21:57.600]  Africa, surprisingly low number of cases, even though they only have 6% of people vaccinated
[1:21:57.600 --> 1:21:58.600]  or something like that.
[1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:05.680]  I mean, the average guy would make the conclusion that if more vaccination means more disease,
[1:22:05.680 --> 1:22:10.160]  then maybe we should stop vaccinating, that the vaccine may be causing the disease.
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:12.480]  But no, we have to come out with variants.
[1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:17.680]  I mean, it's just too, it's just too obvious.
[1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:20.360]  You can't make this stuff up as they've thought this out.
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:22.360]  I will tell you the other thing I looked at.
[1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:26.640]  I looked at the 1918 history of the pandemic back then.
[1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:30.280]  And you know, there were really four things that happened then.
[1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:31.440]  And most people don't realize this.
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:37.040]  I was never taught this in medical school that they could not prove transmission of
[1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:38.040]  influenza.
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:43.840]  You know, we've had all this stuff come out now that just makes it, you realize that there's,
[1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:45.360]  I'm not saying there's nothing there.
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:51.040]  There's something that's killing people, but there is a huge psychological operation that's
[1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:55.040]  driving kind of overlay over that.
[1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:59.680]  And we, and even when you look at what's killing people, we don't know a lot about it.
[1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:02.080]  Why we've been told not to do autopsies.
[1:23:02.080 --> 1:23:03.840]  There are very few autopsies out there.
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:09.300]  I pulled all the autopsies I could find since last year, and there were 74 from around the
[1:23:09.300 --> 1:23:11.200]  world of COVID deaths.
[1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:14.200]  And you know, they're telling us we have a horrible virus that's giving us this viral
[1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:15.200]  pneumonia.
[1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:16.200]  We're dying, right?
[1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:21.480]  And what the one diagnosis is, I didn't find in any of those autopsies, viral pneumonia.
[1:23:21.480 --> 1:23:23.640]  You would think it would be there.
[1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:28.840]  No, but the one thing that is there is microvascular clotting in every one.
[1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:30.760]  So something is happening.
[1:23:30.760 --> 1:23:33.400]  We've been prohibited from scientifically evaluating it.
[1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:36.240]  We've been prohibited from treating it correctly.
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:37.240]  We've been censored.
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:42.840]  I mean, does that sound like a nation or a medical system that really wants to help
[1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:44.840]  us figure this out and treat people?
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:50.040]  Oh, I should admit, they're killing people with protocols that they don't change in the
[1:23:50.040 --> 1:23:51.040]  ICU.
[1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:52.040]  That's right.
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:54.080]  They know sending sick people to nursing homes kills.
[1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:58.280]  They know putting people on innovators and not giving them any type of treatment kills
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:23:59.280]  them.
[1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:00.280]  And they still are doing it.
[1:24:00.280 --> 1:24:02.200]  Now it's prepared to enter year three.
[1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:03.600]  Right.
[1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:07.120]  And listen to what Michael Yidin just said about the midazolam.
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:13.320]  In his mind, the midazolam, and I can't check all the things he has at his, you know, he's
[1:24:13.320 --> 1:24:15.320]  but it's on record.
[1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:16.320]  It makes you or you can't breathe.
[1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:17.320]  It's an assisted suicide drug.
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:18.320]  Right.
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:24.520]  The midazolam and the his point was they stockpiled it before 2020 and then they strategically
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:28.720]  released it and started using it at a time to boost the death numbers.
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:29.720]  That's right.
[1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:30.720]  This is a giant.
[1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:33.480]  So what you're getting at is it's what claustrophobic gates want depopulation.
[1:24:33.480 --> 1:24:34.480]  And this is their rollout.
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:38.240]  The murder of Western medicine, the murder of logic, the murder of free speech, getting
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:42.840]  all their millions in place, purging the military and police and hospitals of people
[1:24:42.840 --> 1:24:46.360]  will ask questions before they roll out something far deadlier.
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:48.200]  That's if I war game it.
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:49.200]  That's the main scenario.
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:50.200]  I see Dr.
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:51.200]  Right.
[1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:55.160]  It's and it's fear that's driving people to do things they would not do in a normal
[1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:56.160]  situation.
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:01.640]  I mean, look, most people would have researched back this vaccine that was experimental when
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:04.560]  the word experimental came out that should have said it should have been a red flag.
[1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:08.200]  Oh, maybe I shouldn't wait and not be the first person on the block to get this.
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:09.800]  But that isn't what happened.
[1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:15.000]  All that I respect that are smart, intelligent people that would have looked at car facts
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:21.240]  before buying a used car ran out and got a vaccine that's never been with a new technology,
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:28.080]  never really made it through animal testing, completely unknown elements in the vaccine.
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:31.480]  Even your doctors don't know what's in it because they don't have to tell us under emergency
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:33.240]  use authorization.
[1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:35.240]  And they went out and got this.
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:39.600]  And here's the point that I've been making to people about this vaccine.
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:40.600]  What we call a vaccine.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:45.600]  I shouldn't even use that term because a vaccine by law or by technical terms is supposed
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:48.000]  to decrease transmission.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.200]  Okay.
[1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:51.960]  They've agreed this doesn't be to decrease transmission.
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:55.520]  It just may on in the e way it may decrease symptoms a bit.
[1:25:55.520 --> 1:25:57.440]  Well, that's a therapeutic agent.
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:02.760]  That's not able to be mandated in any real I mean, that would be like mandating a blood
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:05.320]  pressure medicine rather than another one.
[1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:06.320]  You can't do that.
[1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:11.560]  And so they've missed, they've mislabeled things, they've lied to us about these things.
[1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:16.000]  And at the end of time, people went out and they were so afraid by all the confusion and
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:20.040]  the isolation, everything happening that they took this vaccine without really knowing much
[1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:21.040]  about it.
[1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:26.040]  And now we have numbers coming out that as we, some of us predicted are not good numbers.
[1:26:26.040 --> 1:26:30.000]  Well, that's what I was about to say, what we're having massive more numbers of deaths.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:31.440]  The hospitals this year are actually full.
[1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:32.720]  They weren't last year.
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:36.640]  And they admitted the German and British news, I don't even hide it, that you're twice as
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:39.000]  likely in the hospital or dive, you've had the shot.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.760]  And their answer is more shots, even though they don't protect you.
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:43.360]  I mean, this is crazy.
[1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:44.360]  Right.
[1:26:44.360 --> 1:26:51.560]  It's again, you know, if people weren't afraid, I think they would look at this more realistically.
[1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:53.280]  But they're being afraid.
[1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:57.680]  And part of it is, of course, the nonstop propaganda on television that doesn't tell
[1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:01.240]  you in the mainstream media, that doesn't tell you the truth about this.
[1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:02.840]  So is it this really an IQ test?
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:05.080]  The globalist claim they want to get rid of dumb people.
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:07.320]  I don't agree with doing that.
[1:27:07.320 --> 1:27:10.760]  But this really is a Darwin Awards here.
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:14.040]  Well, some of the smartest people I know ran out and got this.
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:17.160]  I mean, it's hard to believe, but they try to understand they go under Stockholm syndrome.
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:19.120]  Plus the children don't deserve this.
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:20.600]  The children don't deserve it.
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:21.600]  Yeah.
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:25.440]  And that's the, that's the point about the Tabastock Institute and mass mind control.
[1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:26.920]  This is a scientific study.
[1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:27.960]  They know how to do this.
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:32.840]  They know how to push our buttons and make normal people not be acting normally.
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:36.240]  I really think that's what's, that's a major component here.
[1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:40.800]  And I, the other, the other, the other thing I always worry about is that as we're looking
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:43.360]  one direction, what are they doing the other direction?
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:44.360]  That's the other thing.
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:47.280]  It's, it's not the reason I want to get you on in a longer segments coming up.
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:50.440]  It's starting now, Dr. Exactly.
[1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:52.280]  You're a smart lady, big picture.
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:54.400]  What are you expecting them to pull next?
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:57.040]  Well, I think they're already pulling it.
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:03.280]  I'm starting to see people that are younger people that are getting sick with something.
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:04.280]  Okay.
[1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:09.920]  And, but if you look at the, at what we know about, for example, electromagnetic frequency
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:15.800]  toxicity, it's indistinguishable from COVID, from what they call COVID.
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:19.480]  The idea, we, you know, the idea is we don't have a nice little virus.
[1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:20.840]  We're being told there's a virus.
[1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:22.200]  We're being told it's airborne.
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:26.720]  We're being told a lot of things that are not proven, but we do know something about
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:33.240]  electromagnetic frequency and the history behind the pandemic of 1918, various flu pandemics
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:34.240]  in the past.
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:35.240]  That's right.
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:39.880]  We know when new type of radiations are released, it's that at first our bodies aren't used
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:40.880]  to it.
[1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:41.880]  Plagues are connected to that.
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:45.600]  And now you're talking about major studies when we come back that just broke this week.
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:51.960]  Major studies by prestigious groups confirming that 5G radiation is causing symptoms identical
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:52.960]  to COVID-19.
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:54.600]  And this is not a conspiracy theory.
[1:28:54.600 --> 1:28:55.600]  This is proven.
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:28:58.600]  Attention, radio listeners.
[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:02.520]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:07.760]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity.
[1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:10.160]  Well, that's why resetwars.com is so important.
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:16.200]  Not only is it a game changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:23.320]  but it's something that gets around Claw Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:25.560]  and American jobs.
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:27.800]  It is the true digital economy.
[1:29:27.800 --> 1:29:32.000]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent control.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:38.600]  I've been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:40.600]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:45.280]  But I got to tell you out of everything I've done, resetwars is the most important and it
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:51.800]  is now available out of the month of December 2021 is here at resetwars.com.
[1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:57.360]  You're adjourning to the next level today at resetwars.com, the globalist fear this
[1:29:57.360 --> 1:29:58.360]  information.
[1:29:58.360 --> 1:30:02.960]  Get our great bag of it here.
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:07.240]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[1:30:07.240 --> 1:30:12.400]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:30:12.400 --> 1:30:14.960]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:18.200]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:19.720]  but really they're just a commune.
[1:30:19.720 --> 1:30:22.720]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:24.880]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:28.120]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:29.320]  and the price has never gone up.
[1:30:29.320 --> 1:30:33.680]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more for pound.
[1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:36.200]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[1:30:36.200 --> 1:30:40.480]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally, in fact, I'm not
[1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:48.120]  going to tell you a little story, um, we had like the, okay, you wouldn't believe it anyway.
[1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:52.320]  So it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:58.520]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[1:30:58.520 --> 1:31:01.320]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[1:31:01.320 --> 1:31:06.480]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[1:31:06.480 --> 1:31:10.400]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:16.880]  and threatening in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:21.160]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come
[1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:25.440]  and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:31:25.440 --> 1:31:27.240]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:31:27.240 --> 1:31:31.480]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[1:31:31.480 --> 1:31:35.720]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[1:31:35.720 --> 1:31:38.360]  grade at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:38.360 --> 1:31:43.120]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com.
[1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:48.720]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones,
[1:31:48.720 --> 1:31:51.360]  we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:53.920]  It's all there at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:53.920 --> 1:31:59.720]  So protect your privacy today and support the info war at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:59.720 --> 1:32:05.680]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:07.480]  and chemicals added to the food.
[1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:08.480]  It's all come out.
[1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:12.120]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of
[1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:18.960]  God, the creator, and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:22.800]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:26.600]  with the boy, is it true?
[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:32.440]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:32:32.440 --> 1:32:36.240]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:42.920]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:44.920]  of this world who is a loser.
[1:32:44.920 --> 1:32:48.800]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever.
[1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:53.040]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:54.840]  up is safe handling.
[1:32:54.840 --> 1:33:00.240]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[1:33:00.240 --> 1:33:07.240]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:35.640]  TheMedicalRebel.com, see her great writings and amazing interviews and videos there and
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:40.480]  supporter, TheMedicalRebel.com, that are Lee Merritt, is our guest and I wanted to hit
[1:33:40.480 --> 1:33:46.840]  here the fact that I produced this film, part two is out, it's a five part series, very
[1:33:46.840 --> 1:33:50.520]  highly produced, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., you name it, everybody's got it.
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:54.480]  And it is cobbled in the mask, even more powerful than part one, and part one's very powerful.
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:57.760]  It's available right now, ready to ship it out to you in time for Christmas or before
[1:33:57.760 --> 1:33:58.760]  Christmas.

[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:21.200]  Dark Cigarettes Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death All on One DVD.

[1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:30.520]  their store-wide free shipping right now, and double-patriot points.
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:34.640]  Going back to Dr. Lee Merrim, got interrupted by the break, and you were getting into the
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:39.120]  Tabistock Institute and the Mind Control, and then there's a Greg Riesch report that
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:43.840]  I'll put on screen that has the different medical studies that came out years ago about
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:48.440]  5G before Covid came out, and then currently in the new ones that it indeed pushes oxygen
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:51.240]  out of the blood and causes other effects.
[1:34:51.240 --> 1:34:56.640]  Scientific study concludes that 5G exacerbated Covid, that just broke, and you were going
[1:34:56.640 --> 1:34:57.640]  there.
[1:34:57.640 --> 1:34:58.640]  Dr. Lee, please continue.
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:01.800]  Dr. Lee Merrim Well, yeah, we know how this works.
[1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.600]  I mean, it's not that we haven't looked at the science.
[1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:13.840]  What happens, and what happens is, when you're in an electromagnetic field, your metabolism
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:18.840]  depends on your being able to have an electron transport chain in your mitochondria.
[1:35:18.840 --> 1:35:23.440]  The mitochondria, the little parts of your cells, they're like your furnaces.
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:29.920]  They would produce power from food, and when you disrupt that electron chain ever so slightly,
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:36.400]  you disrupt your ability to optimally metabolize food, and that's essentially what happens
[1:35:36.400 --> 1:35:40.960]  if you're toxic from radiofrequency radiation, non-ionizing radiation.
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:47.320]  Now, it's interesting that when you go back to, and I have my family is filled with electrical
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:50.960]  engineers and they all think I'm a little nuts because they're working in the macro
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:59.840]  environment, but it's true that we're dealing with microcurrents and very, very small currents
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:01.720]  that are going through that are causing this.
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:03.880]  It doesn't take a lot.
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:09.480]  In 1918, it's very interesting, I mentioned earlier, they never proved transmission of
[1:36:09.480 --> 1:36:11.520]  the flu.
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:16.680]  They tried, I mean, they did even things like taking, and I apologize the term snot, but
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:20.040]  that's not a technical medical term, but you know what it is, the goobers from your
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.640]  nose and your lungs, and they put it into healthy people, they couldn't get them sick.
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:30.200]  They also literally spun that stuff down, tried to purify it essentially, so if there
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:34.560]  were a small particle in there, it'd be concentrated, and injected it into volunteers, and they
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:36.080]  didn't get the flu.
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:41.520]  Horses came down with this, but they couldn't transmit it from horse to horse.
[1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:42.520]  So what was going on?
[1:36:42.520 --> 1:36:45.480]  Well, it's interesting that we call it the Spanish flu.
[1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:46.480]  Why do we do that?
[1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:47.840]  Because it didn't start in Spain.
[1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:51.120]  It started in Fort Riley, Kansas, and what was happening there?
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:56.720]  Well, we were training a group of Army guys to go overseas, and among those were telegrophers,
[1:36:56.720 --> 1:37:01.280]  the people that are learning to do Morse code, and it was the first time that humans were
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:08.120]  really around interrupted electrical signals, alternating currents, and what happened is
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:12.800]  even before that, we had called it telegrophers disease.
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:16.280]  Telegram operators, as soon as the lines went up, started getting sick.
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:19.800]  Not necessarily dying, but they were getting sick around the world.
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:22.720]  And so in 1918, four things came together.
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:26.280]  We had the telegrophers being trained in Fort Riley, Kansas.
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:32.680]  It's the first time that we gave our military a battery of vaccines before they went overseas.
[1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:36.280]  We had a drug that was being given inappropriately.
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.120]  It was called aspirin, and the Bayer and aspirin had lost their patent, and were convincing
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:45.760]  doctors through the AMA to use it whenever there was a fever, and we have a lot of these
[1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:52.200]  memory books from 1918 that show doctors just pushing handfuls of aspirin into these young
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:55.560]  recruits that were sick with the so-called flu.
[1:37:55.560 --> 1:38:01.200]  Well, ultimately, we sent out a pathologist, William Wells, from the Armed Forces Institute
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:07.560]  of Pathology, who did autopsies on these people in 1918, and what he found was bloody lungs,
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:09.360]  that they were bleeding into their lungs.
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:13.240]  Again, inflammation and aspirin overdose explains some of this.
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:14.880]  A lot of people died.
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:17.000]  But it's interesting who it was.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.080]  And then when it went overseas, think what we also did.
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:28.840]  We also vaccinated our overseas people, and we took over the telegram and ways to do high
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:32.600]  volume signaling with this thing, so we can get it across the English Channel to France,
[1:38:32.600 --> 1:38:33.600]  et cetera.
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.520]  And Dr. Merrick, let me just back up what you're saying, because I've been studying this
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:37.960]  long before this even happened, and I know you have.
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:39.880]  And this is mainline medical research.
[1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:43.360]  What you're saying isn't like something Cougs came up with, and here's the difference.
[1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:50.440]  They argue, well, the sun is this giant electromagnetic microwave, but it comes up gradually, it goes
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:55.080]  down gradually, and it's based on when we go to bed, when we get up, we got a habit
[1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:58.360]  in our skin to live, and yeah, it gives us cancer actually in the end.
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:00.440]  So we needed to live, but it also kills us.
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:01.560]  It's what makes the plants grow.
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:06.000]  We're in a high level of electromagnetic radiation, but what I've read from the studies
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:10.560]  is, they've done this with ants, with birds, and with plants, with just the regular cell
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:15.040]  towers that are, again, are the longer wavelengths, and of course, up closer, really deadly, just
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:16.040]  like the small ones.
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:17.040]  It's not debatable.
[1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:21.680]  You could type in 5G in cancer, and you've got Wired Magazine articles five years ago
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:25.080]  with prestigious scientists saying, yeah, massive increase in cancer.
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:27.040]  It's flicking on and off.
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:32.920]  It's constantly oscillating, and so your body, at a level, is electrochemically giving itself
[1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:33.920]  orders.
[1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:38.120]  It also gets influx from the universe, so there's more crimes and stuff with the moon,
[1:39:38.120 --> 1:39:40.560]  so we're getting a more electromagnetic radiation at night.
[1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:46.160]  We're not used to, and so it's the constant billions of changes an hour, just all these
[1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:51.120]  different fields, all of this then causing issues inside the cells, then you add a new
[1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:55.000]  pathogen to that, and it can cause all sorts of strange mutations.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:56.160]  That's my layperson's read.
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:39:57.640]  Is that accurate?
[1:39:57.640 --> 1:39:58.880]  I think that's pretty close.
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:04.440]  The, you know, the, the eye, Canon's law of the body, we learned in medical school.
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:07.280]  It says the body responds to rate of change.
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:12.480]  So if something is gentle and it starts slowly, you can adapt to it to some degree, but you're
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:13.480]  right.
[1:40:13.480 --> 1:40:16.720]  When it keeps flicking on and off, it's hard, and that's what happened when you bring up
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:17.720]  the sun.
[1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:21.920]  You know, most people don't realize that before the telegram lines were laid, we didn't have
[1:40:21.920 --> 1:40:24.200]  seasonal influenza.
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:27.600]  Influenza was something that had a worldwide outburst.
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:29.920]  Influenza comes from the word to influence.
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:34.480]  Nobody knew what it was for, from, but they knew that periodically in the, you know, back
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:40.640]  into the 1500s and 1700s, these, boom, they'd be an outbreak all around the world.
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:43.240]  And then it would be absent for decades.
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:44.520]  And then what happened again?
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:47.680]  And it turned out a very smart astronomer, I think from Winnipeg, looked back at this
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:50.560]  and said, it correlates with sunspot activity.
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:51.560]  So do wars.
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:52.560]  So do wars.
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:57.200]  I mean, I mean, like even bank capital, Goldman Sachs, they're all obsessed with sunspots in
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:40:58.200]  their own literature.
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:40:59.440]  They know this is real.
[1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:00.440]  Yeah.
[1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:02.400]  So, so there's a lot of things happening here.
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:05.480]  And so I don't believe it's all psychological operation.
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:10.760]  I personally think we've, we even the mainstream media has come to the belief that the spike
[1:41:10.760 --> 1:41:16.080]  protein was manipulated as genetic material taken from nature, taken into labs, manipulated
[1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:17.400]  to harm people.
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:19.000]  So by definition, that's a bio weapon.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.680]  Now, keep in mind, if that's a bio weapon, when your body produces the same spike protein,
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.120]  haven't been giving these, this RNA or DNA vaccine, it's also a bio weapon.
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:29.800]  I totally agree, Dr. Merritt.
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:33.800]  So what do you think they're really doing because obviously multiple injections was
[1:41:33.800 --> 1:41:34.800]  always pre-planned.
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:36.760]  They admitted, now they say it's permanent.
[1:41:36.760 --> 1:41:39.480]  You were on the, years ago saying that was going to come.
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:40.680]  This is clearly a plan now.
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:41.680]  We now know that.
[1:41:41.680 --> 1:41:43.180]  Where's the plan go?
[1:41:43.180 --> 1:41:46.920]  I think it goes, I think the 5G is part of the end game.
[1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:47.920]  I really do.
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:52.040]  I think that they're distracting us with all the, everything else.
[1:41:52.040 --> 1:41:57.480]  And quite frankly, I feel confident that we are going to master the disease process.
[1:41:57.480 --> 1:42:01.920]  Right now, we could be saving a lot more people if we, if people would put things in their
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:06.840]  homes like nebulizers, pulse oximeters, stock up on ivermectin that they won't let us do,
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:07.840]  stock up on these things.
[1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:11.480]  We could probably solve 90% of this or more.
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:13.640]  We always are going to have disease among humans.
[1:42:13.640 --> 1:42:14.640]  No man, I agree.
[1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:16.760]  They're trying to stop us fixing the problem.
[1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:18.600]  But they're trying to stop us fixing the problem.
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:22.080]  While we are so concentrated on this, what else is going on?
[1:42:22.080 --> 1:42:24.440]  I can't prove this to them, but what else is going on?
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:28.080]  They're putting the 5G in, they're collapsing the borders, they're destroying the dollar,
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:30.000]  they're getting ready for the cyber attack.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:31.800]  Yeah, activating this.
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:37.560]  And I've heard, you know, a friend of mine who's a researcher was sent a video from
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:43.720]  China that claimed that the Chinese, it's a leak apparently, I've got it on my telegram,
[1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:50.920]  she's got it on hers, Lynn Finn, it's Chinese talking about how their goal is to vaccinate
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:53.000]  all our military and then they've won.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  No, that's right.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  What about that when we come back?
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  Stay with us.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  So this could
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:04.680]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:11.040]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause an economic
[1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:14.160]  and financial collapse worldwide.
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:17.440]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always been something that's important to
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:18.440]  have.
[1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:21.320]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have, taking care of, right along with water
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:25.200]  filtration, self-defense and a relationship with God.
[1:43:25.200 --> 1:43:28.560]  But now more than ever, you need to get your storeable food orders in.
[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:32.000]  Now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  It's high quality.
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:37.720]  It's very, very low cost at infowarstore.com because in the future, you're going to see
[1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:42.040]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:43.360]  already taking place.
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:49.680]  So lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund the info war at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:53.560]  That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient and not under their
[1:43:53.560 --> 1:43:54.560]  control.
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:43:59.080]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:03.000]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.520]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss that everybody else
[1:44:08.520 --> 1:44:19.240]  has and it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:22.920]  and bled and sweat for.
[1:44:22.920 --> 1:44:28.480]  And now we're just throwing it all away and I see that they're all public, ENA, medically
[1:44:28.480 --> 1:44:35.640]  induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled, tranty and I know
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:39.760]  we're being fed into this global speaker under and it's so incredibly sad.
[1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:46.960]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then deteriorating
[1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:49.840]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:54.800]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[1:44:54.800 --> 1:44:58.280]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:02.880]  If you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad, wait till they've
[1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:08.520]  got their world ID in and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[1:45:08.520 --> 1:45:13.960]  And clow swab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own words they admit that
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:19.080]  once they've gotten you with that system then they're going to carbon tax you everywhere
[1:45:19.080 --> 1:45:24.040]  you go and track what you do and publicly they're saying they're going to decide when
[1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:29.320]  you can travel and when you can't travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies
[1:45:29.320 --> 1:45:33.400]  are currently announcing they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:35.760]  you with a carbon tax for it.
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:39.360]  This is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen.
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:42.920]  This is the takeover and humanity better wake up and say no.
[1:45:42.920 --> 1:45:44.360]  Many folks are starting to wake up.
[1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:48.320]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others who leave the chart along with info wars but it's not
[1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:49.320]  enough.
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:52.880]  Every individual has to not comply and we have to talk about bringing the globalists
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:53.880]  to justice.
[1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:58.320]  You see they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:46:01.160]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[1:46:01.160 --> 1:46:05.480]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide
[1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:11.440]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data and
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:16.240]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do so in the future under
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:20.080]  their globalist takeover they can shut you down.
[1:46:20.080 --> 1:46:24.200]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[1:46:24.200 --> 1:46:27.920]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:31.160]  That's why everybody should visit info wars store.com.
[1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:38.480]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant made in America products that have 100% reviews

[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:22.160]  Dr. Lee Merritt is our guest and I'm going to do a commercial free podcast soon with
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:24.880]  her so she can really roll and go through all this.
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:29.320]  I got Dr. Peter McCullough on Joe Rogan and they're saying that's going to be his biggest
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:30.320]  interview yet.
[1:47:30.320 --> 1:47:34.200]  It may even break records that I set and that Elon Musk set to be the number one podcast
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:35.200]  he's ever done.
[1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:40.840]  It's over 20 million people just on one platform so far, 40 million total as of last night.
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:45.400]  So that's very exciting news and Joe Rogan kept asking him, why are they doing this?
[1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:48.160]  And Dr. McCullough doesn't want to go that extra mile.
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:52.760]  I get it, he's a doctor, he's been an FDA scientist, he doesn't want to speculate but
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:58.160]  this is political at the end of the day, it's about a takeover, it's about depopulation.
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:02.000]  So Dr. Lee Merritt, I want to thank you so much for being here with us today.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:05.600]  I've got a few more questions for you and again please come back on a commercial free
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  show because an hour is then uninterrupted.
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:14.080]  But what else do you want to impart to the listeners and viewers of this show?
[1:48:14.080 --> 1:48:18.280]  Well, you know, J. Edgar Hoover one time said that the individual is handicapped by coming
[1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:22.880]  face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous that he cannot believe it exists.
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:27.640]  That's part of what's happening here, the biggest lie we've ever been involved with
[1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:33.220]  and it's engendering fear and fear is the, that's what's going to take us down.
[1:48:33.220 --> 1:48:37.880]  So I think there are really four things we need to do to get out of this.
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:42.240]  The first thing is people need to turn off their TV and movies because it's used for
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:45.880]  predictive programming and to an outright propaganda.
[1:48:45.880 --> 1:48:46.880]  It really is.
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:50.440]  I mean, you cannot, you cannot look at the numbers scientifically and then look at what
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:53.720]  they're telling you and make any sense of it.
[1:48:53.720 --> 1:48:58.480]  And everybody needs to get into this fight now because first of all, purpose in life
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:00.060]  is a great antidote to fear.
[1:49:00.060 --> 1:49:05.120]  But next, the second point is, is that when 5G is fully implemented, if that really is
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:08.440]  the point, it's a directed energy weapon.
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:11.920]  That's what it was designed for and we're going to have to take this on.
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:17.080]  We can't just sit by because it will, it will come into our homes.
[1:49:17.080 --> 1:49:21.680]  And by the way, we found a bunch of CIA documents, we covered my reset Wars piece where they
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:25.400]  were admitting decades ago they were going to put up towers for mind control to control
[1:49:25.400 --> 1:49:26.400]  the populace.
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:30.240]  Of course, that's the logical extension of control freak bureaucrats and mad scientist
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:31.920]  given unlimited power.
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:32.920]  Yeah.
[1:49:32.920 --> 1:49:38.680]  I mean, you know, this was 5G was used for a directed energy weapon and it was a denial
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:41.400]  of access weapon in places like Iraq.
[1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:46.240]  You turn on 5G, you turn up enough power, you hit the right frequency and it resonates
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:48.120]  with everybody's hair follicles.
[1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:50.560]  So it makes you feel like you're completely on fire.
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:55.960]  Oh, that's the next thing everybody's talking about their hair falling out in the 5G areas.
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:49:56.960]  Yeah.
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:49:58.400]  I don't know what to make of that.
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:00.320]  I've, I've, that's been a problem.
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:05.680]  I think what happens is it can be from being just from being sick can do it.
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:08.800]  But I agree with you that there is a lot of suspicious things.
[1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:13.400]  Another one, pink urine, believe it or not, that's one of the things it turns out people
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:20.320]  that are more sensitive to electrical magnetic frequency toxicity have a, have a defect in
[1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:24.120]  their porphyrin manufacturing, what makes hemoglobin.
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:27.960]  And one of the ways it shows up is you have pink urine sometimes.
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:28.960]  So,
[1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:33.800]  And by the way, shows like Better Call Saul and the rest of it make fun of people to talk
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:39.440]  about this, but you can type in cell phone towers or 5G cancer and get prestigious reports
[1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:40.640]  going back decades.
[1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:42.760]  What we're talking about is not debatable.
[1:50:42.760 --> 1:50:46.400]  The fact is what is in your cell phone is the same thing in a microwave oven.
[1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:48.680]  The difference is a microwave oven is shielded.
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:49.680]  Right.
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:51.400]  And it's not completely shielded.
[1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:52.400]  Right.
[1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:55.200]  That's why they tell you to be careful when you've got pacemakers.
[1:50:55.200 --> 1:50:56.640]  And what are they telling you with a new iPhone?
[1:50:56.640 --> 1:50:59.400]  Be careful if you don't buy one, if you have a new pacemaker.
[1:50:59.400 --> 1:51:05.240]  Yeah, neurosurgeons know about this and they, the same, you know, who controls you when
[1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:07.560]  you know whom you cannot criticize.
[1:51:07.560 --> 1:51:13.920]  And the telecommunications industry has the same indemnity from lawsuit that the vaccine
[1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:15.400]  industry does.
[1:51:15.400 --> 1:51:17.400]  And anybody, and that's the point.
[1:51:17.400 --> 1:51:21.040]  Every time, you know, I've been in medicine for 45 years.
[1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:25.840]  I've actually been instrumental in taking a drug off the market that was not a good
[1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:26.840]  drug.
[1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:32.160]  I think nobody, you know, and when Vioxx came out, after three weeks, I recognized it wasn't
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:33.160]  a good drug.
[1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:35.200]  It took the FDA three years to take it off.
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:40.000]  But when I started speaking against Vioxx, nobody said, oh, that's one of those crazy
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:43.440]  Cux 2 inhibitor, you know, non blah, blah, blah.
[1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:47.960]  No, but you don't like one vaccine and suddenly you're an anti-vaxxer.
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:51.120]  And you know, you're a tinfoil hat if you speak against 5G.
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:53.720]  I think that we see a pattern here.
[1:51:53.720 --> 1:51:55.240]  The answer is not to argue the science.
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:58.920]  The answer is to demonize the people speaking out.
[1:51:58.920 --> 1:52:05.080]  And this one, everybody better wake up to, because it's not by accident that this is
[1:52:05.080 --> 1:52:07.960]  happening altogether, I think.
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:08.960]  It should tell you something.
[1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:13.960]  I think it's in Haifa, Israel that the, wherever Technion is, I think it's Haifa.
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:17.400]  But they've gotten the Wi-Fi out of their schools.
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:18.720]  Why did they do that?
[1:52:18.720 --> 1:52:24.640]  Because they realized just what you were showing on that graph, that children's body mass
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:29.040]  makes them more susceptible to damage from Wi-Fi.
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:30.840]  And so they hardwired their schools.
[1:52:30.840 --> 1:52:35.200]  I read that and I went home and told my husband we had a hardwire house.
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:39.000]  You know, I had my house totally hardwired and then, you know, you catch family members
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:41.760]  hiding wireless transmitters doing it.
[1:52:41.760 --> 1:52:42.760]  Absolutely.
[1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:43.760]  I mean, we have the answer.
[1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:44.760]  It's called wiring things.
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:46.560]  Well, like in a gun, a gun has a tube.
[1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:48.000]  You fire it one place.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.320]  You don't have it where it explodes in all directions.
[1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:55.040]  We need directed energy, not directed energy at us.
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:56.040]  Right.
[1:52:56.040 --> 1:53:00.080]  And I hope my husband is an IT guy is listening to this because I had the same issue.
[1:53:00.080 --> 1:53:01.680]  Family members hide these.
[1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:02.680]  And I went around.
[1:53:02.680 --> 1:53:07.000]  Unfortunately, the 5G, you cannot test with meters at this point, but you can test the
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:09.800]  lesser cellular frequencies.
[1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:14.320]  And it turned out that, you know, when you go around, I kept saying there's got to be
[1:53:14.320 --> 1:53:18.840]  something under my chair where my office is because this, and I found it was a router
[1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:19.840]  that we had stacked.
[1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:23.360]  You know, listen, when my ex-wife was divorcing me, I had to live in a condo for a while.
[1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:25.320]  It was in this big high-rise.
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:29.360]  And I'm not a person that's paranoid, I'm not a person that has trouble sleeping.
[1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:31.880]  And I couldn't sleep in this room.
[1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:34.440]  So when I slept in another room, I could, and I've always slept good.
[1:53:34.440 --> 1:53:38.320]  And I finally realized there was a giant wireless router in the closet right behind the bed.
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:42.080]  Turned that sucker off, had him hardwired, slept great for the two years I lived there.
[1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:45.720]  But I mean, if something's messing my sleep up, I know something's going on.
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:48.960]  And it's because it's flicking on and off and it's sending a charge through my brain.
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:52.200]  And yeah, it's a lot weaker than a microwave or whatever, but at the point it doesn't matter.
[1:53:52.200 --> 1:53:54.960]  My brain picks up a new wave coming through.
[1:53:54.960 --> 1:53:55.960]  And that's what's happening.
[1:53:55.960 --> 1:53:56.960]  Yeah.
[1:53:56.960 --> 1:54:02.600]  And I've been treating people this last year with Ivermectin and the various different
[1:54:02.600 --> 1:54:08.080]  things for presumed COVID that we don't completely have our heads wrapped around what it is.
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:10.640]  But it kind of died out in the summer.
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:15.560]  And we could, but before even the cold weather hit, it came back.
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:20.720]  And suddenly I was getting calls and I finally asked somebody, I said, because this person
[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:21.720]  did have pink here.
[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:27.000]  And I said, do you think there's 5G that's gone around by your area because I'm getting
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:28.320]  a lot of calls in that area?
[1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:30.240]  And that's exactly, that had happened.
[1:54:30.240 --> 1:54:32.280]  And it had actually, we had been sick in the office.
[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:33.280]  Well, it's the same thing in Wuhan.
[1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:34.280]  I'm starting to rub it.
[1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:38.960]  I mean, Wuhan, all the main places it broke out was where the 5G was instituted.
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:43.880]  And in that hospital where Dr. Lee died, it had been completely 5G Wi-Fi.
[1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:44.880]  Yeah.
[1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:47.600]  And that and Lombardi, I understand, and also New York City.
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:53.240]  Now, they're not the only cities, but apparently it's a pretty good match.
[1:54:53.240 --> 1:55:00.040]  I'm just, the problem with 5G too that people need to understand is it's not like 2G and
[1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:01.040]  3G, it's 4G.
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:04.040]  It makes it sound like there's just a continuum now we just set it up.
[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:08.520]  No, it's just a totally new technology, super small, high-powered wavelength.
[1:55:08.520 --> 1:55:10.080]  And it's intermittent, like you said.
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:13.840]  It's not, we live in a little cloud of 2G or 3G or 4G.
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:16.240]  That was okay to a certain degree.
[1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:19.360]  It was somewhat harmful, but we were able to adapt to it.
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:24.360]  But when you have something like this that comes in bursts all the time is hard for the
[1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:25.520]  body to adapt.
[1:55:25.520 --> 1:55:26.520]  Exactly.
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:27.520]  All right.
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:28.520]  Well, Dr. Merritt, incredible job.
[1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:32.240]  Well, you promised, I know it lots going on, but the next few months, let's do a commercial
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:33.240]  free hour interview.
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:34.720]  You can send a whole list of things.
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:35.720]  We'll get into them all.
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:38.520]  Dr. Lee Merritt, and is the best place for people to find the great work you're doing
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:40.360]  at themedicalrebel.com?
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:41.360]  Absolutely.
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:46.640]  And I've got a how-to, what you should do right now to protect yourself and your family.
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:47.640]  All right.
[1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:48.640]  30 seconds on this, though.
[1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:50.640]  Are you optimistic about the future?
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:51.720]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:59.440]  You know, besides the fact that we're humans, we have a connection to God, and we're also
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:00.440]  Americans.
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:01.440]  Americans don't give up.
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:02.440]  We're not going to give over our land.
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:04.400]  We're not going to give over our freedoms.
[1:56:04.400 --> 1:56:05.640]  I don't see that happening.
[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:06.640]  Absolutely.
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:07.640]  This is a real war.
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:08.640]  We realize it's a war.
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:09.640]  We win.
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:10.640]  We don't.
[1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:11.640]  It's a great Christmas.
[1:56:11.640 --> 1:56:12.640]  Thank you.
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:13.640]  You too.
[1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:14.640]  All right, folks.
[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:15.640]  Amazing interview.
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:16.640]  Amazing lady.
[1:56:16.640 --> 1:56:20.960]  I have got so much to cover next hour on the January 6th Committee on Inflation, on Elon
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:25.440]  Musk, on China, and this key article out of ZeroHedge that is so smart, now it ties into
[1:56:25.440 --> 1:56:29.680]  the Bilderberg Group that runs Davos, that is running this whole thing.
[1:56:29.680 --> 1:56:30.680]  That's coming up.
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:34.360]  But separately, you know, a lot of people are signing up for Reset Wars, and we're getting
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:38.880]  a lot of great feedback from the thousands of people that have signed up for the course.
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:43.640]  And it's a great course, and it's game-changing stuff, and it funds us launching whole new
[1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:45.520]  operations, whole new systems.
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:50.520]  So soon on the air, I'm going to lay out people that, going at the course, what else
[1:56:50.520 --> 1:56:52.120]  is going to be added to the site?
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:57.400]  But it's going to be independent shows, special guests, master classes, you know, so much
[1:56:57.400 --> 1:56:59.960]  at resetwars.com.
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:07.760]  And you've got till tomorrow night, 11.59 p.m. to get 25% off on the course at Reset
[1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:10.400]  Wars.com.
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:18.240]  And again, folks, if people would have listened to me 25 years ago, we would have stopped
[1:57:18.240 --> 1:57:19.240]  it.
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:20.240]  You were listening.
[1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:24.560]  But I'm telling you, this is so game-changing, and people will just understand this is real.
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:25.720]  This is how they control us.
[1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:29.960]  This is, if people actually embrace this, research this, and use it, we will defeat
[1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:30.960]  them quickly.
[1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:33.640]  I got a feeling those stuff's going to get a lot worse, where people finally dig this
[1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:34.640]  up and use it.
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:39.440]  One way or another, this will be a game-changer.
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:43.080]  Resetwars.com, and it also keeps us on the air, want to thank you for your support.
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:47.200]  Go to Reset Wars and sign up right now.
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:48.880]  So this could be...
[1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:52.440]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity.
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:57.200]  Everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering
[1:57:57.200 --> 1:57:58.200]  humanity.
[1:57:58.200 --> 1:58:00.240]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com is so important.
[1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:06.120]  Not only is it a game-changing course of critical information to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[1:58:06.120 --> 1:58:13.240]  but it's something that gets around Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure
[1:58:13.240 --> 1:58:14.720]  and American jobs.
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:17.720]  It is the true digital economy.
[1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:21.920]  It's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent control.
[1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:28.520]  I've been on there 28 years, and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's
[1:58:28.520 --> 1:58:30.520]  divine empowerment and blessing.
[1:58:30.520 --> 1:58:35.200]  But I got to tell you, out of everything I've done, ResetWars is the most important, and
[1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:38.680]  it is now available out of the month of December 2021.
[1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:41.720]  It's here at ResetWars.com.
[1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:45.640]  Start your journey to the next level today at ResetWars.com.
[1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:48.360]  The globalist fear this information.
[1:58:48.360 --> 1:58:52.800]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:54.160]  I like going to concerts.
[1:58:54.160 --> 1:58:55.520]  I like going to play golf.
[1:58:55.520 --> 1:58:56.920]  I like going out to dinner.
[1:58:56.920 --> 1:58:58.960]  I like the metropolitan life.
[1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:01.440]  I like everything that comes with this.
[1:59:01.440 --> 1:59:07.520]  But see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities,
[1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:12.120]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas, because unless we change course soon, it's
[1:59:12.120 --> 1:59:13.120]  all crashing down.
[1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:17.040]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in
[1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:20.600]  the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the
[1:59:20.600 --> 1:59:21.600]  land?
[1:59:21.600 --> 1:59:22.600]  That's the survival instinct.
[1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:27.480]  See, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no, no, no, no.
[1:59:27.480 --> 1:59:28.480]  Stay in the city.
[1:59:28.480 --> 1:59:31.840]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there's ever notion that you need
[1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:33.520]  to get a vaccine or a mask.
[1:59:33.520 --> 1:59:39.000]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you and the audience are facing
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  as well.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:44.600]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[1:59:44.600 --> 1:59:46.600]  And so we have the best ones at M4WarsStore.com.
[1:59:46.600 --> 1:59:47.600]  M4Wars.
[1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:54.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[2:00:17.600 --> 2:00:28.920]  2022 is the year of the Tiger.
[2:00:28.920 --> 2:00:34.880]  The Communist Chinese haven't thrown away all of the ancient mysticism and folklore
[2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:35.880]  of China.
[2:00:35.880 --> 2:00:40.360]  And they really go off of these are couple years and they believe the best years to launch
[2:00:40.360 --> 2:00:43.840]  a war, launch a new endeavor are the Dragon and the Tiger.
[2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:47.480]  But the Dragon and their lore can be seen as turning against you and though it gives you
[2:00:47.480 --> 2:00:52.200]  great power in that year to launch a war, sometimes the Dragon can be a trickster.
[2:00:52.200 --> 2:00:57.960]  But the Tiger is never a trickster and is the second most powerful creature on the Chinese
[2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:01.440]  Zodiac and their leaders really believe in this stuff.
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:05.160]  Well, it just so happens that I'm year of the Tiger next year as well and that's my
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:06.160]  sign.
[2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:11.360]  So maybe there is something to it, but probably not regardless in their minds there is.
[2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:15.880]  And it's all about what your mind believes, it's all about the confines we put over our
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:21.520]  minds that limit us and so that's why superstitions like what year or your Zodiac are so important
[2:01:21.520 --> 2:01:22.520]  even to world leaders.
[2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:26.760]  Hitler was obsessed with stuff like that, Napoleon, Julius Caesar and so many others
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:31.080]  because by believing in the stars it allows them to actually believe in themselves and
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:33.840]  this goes into the false constructs and mind control.
[2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:39.640]  So this is the year of the Tiger 2022 that we are going into and I want everybody to
[2:01:39.640 --> 2:01:42.920]  get the latest information on how we are fighting back and how we are breaking our condition
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:45.620]  together at resetwars.com.
[2:01:45.620 --> 2:01:49.640]  Resetwars is now live, of course he is now available, thousands of people have signed
[2:01:49.640 --> 2:01:54.480]  up, we are getting rave reviews back and there is 25% off running right now for just a few
[2:01:54.480 --> 2:01:55.480]  more days.
[2:01:55.480 --> 2:02:09.080]  So we are about to leave 2021 and go to 2022, the year of the Tiger and resetwars.com.
[2:02:09.080 --> 2:02:15.400]  Most people grasp the information in the resetwars, two courses that are together right now, spiritwars,
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:16.400]  mindwars.
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:21.480]  It will change the whole paradigm but if people realize the Bilderberg group was a private
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:26.280]  corporate mafia intelligence agency that took control of most major governments, we even
[2:02:26.280 --> 2:02:31.920]  have all the documents, we change things too but people just hear this show and they just
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:36.720]  think oh that guy has got a Texas twang, I've seen a lot of, I love folks from New York
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:40.400]  and the East Coast are great people, a lot of them are really awake, a lot of people
[2:02:40.400 --> 2:02:44.400]  aren't awake down here in Texas but they say I didn't listen to that guy because he had
[2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:50.320]  a Texas accent, how about I speak to you in an English accent then, in fact next segment
[2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:55.440]  I will, next segment I will talk about the Bilderberg group and the organizations they
[2:02:55.440 --> 2:03:00.720]  set up and they are establishing a world government in ways I believe we can stop them
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:04.800]  because we must stop them together.
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:09.400]  Only realizing a criminal organization is attacking us, only realizing they are out
[2:03:09.400 --> 2:03:14.720]  to literally depopulate us, not just conquer us, will give us the tools we need to not
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:22.040]  just survive but to thrive on our planet today and so I will no longer ever again speak with
[2:03:22.040 --> 2:03:29.720]  my normal Texas accent, I will now speak with this accent that gives me a 50 point IQ boost
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:38.040]  to 200 points, yes my friends, little Alex Jones, can you imagine I'm actually so speedy
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:44.040]  in this accent all the time, for months on in with the media will do a major news issue
[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:50.560]  and will become, actually the question is do I have the strength to stop conducting all
[2:03:50.560 --> 2:04:02.560]  future broadcasts in this voice, I can walk, that's German accent, it's so hard to do a
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:13.920]  British accent, oh my God help me, oh I got so much news to cover, whiskey bottles, brand
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:23.720]  new cars, oak tree in my way, I am so sick of these murdering globalists, but let me
[2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:27.680]  tell you what I'm really sick of, the general public that stays in their damn trance while
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:31.960]  they're having their whole future destroyed with this whole globalist operation, we've
[2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:36.520]  proven we're the horse to bet on in the fight, we've proven we've got the zeitgeist and I'm
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:41.480]  telling you, you want the zeitgeist of the zeitgeist of the zeitgeist of the zeitgeist,
[2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:44.840]  you want the creme dollar creme, the creme of the creme of the creme of the creme of
[2:04:44.840 --> 2:04:50.440]  the creme, it's at resetwars.com, not just the course of super powerful information,
[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:57.600]  your funding of us will take us to the next level together, resetwars.com is live, everything
[2:04:57.600 --> 2:05:05.840]  I do, get our great bag of it here, I mean this is from, people say why is it from Chiapas,
[2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:09.960]  Mexico, the communists, well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's
[2:05:09.960 --> 2:05:15.520]  wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah,
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:18.840]  we buy it from the little farmers that the media calls communists but really they're
[2:05:18.840 --> 2:05:22.800]  just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and
[2:05:22.800 --> 2:05:25.880]  the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the
[2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:29.120]  Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years and the price has never gone
[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:33.480]  up, the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, for pound
[2:05:33.480 --> 2:05:36.560]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere, it's Wake Up
[2:05:36.560 --> 2:05:41.560]  America, Patriot Blend, from the Chiapas rebels, literally, in fact, I'm not going to tell
[2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:50.560]  you a little story, we had one, okay, you wouldn't believe it, anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[2:05:50.560 --> 2:05:53.680]  and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us and don't want to share
[2:05:53.680 --> 2:06:10.800]  that, that's fine.
[2:06:10.800 --> 2:06:17.000]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Tuesday, December 14th, World Wide
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:24.040]  Broadcast, well, Gregory always releases really powerful information at Band-Aught Video
[2:06:24.040 --> 2:06:30.640]  on the Gregory section, but he put out a video today dealing with the training and the development
[2:06:30.640 --> 2:06:37.560]  of the Bilderberg, Deimos Group, New World Orders, Judas Goats and it goes and shows
[2:06:37.560 --> 2:06:41.960]  how they go recruit all the major leaders for decades and then fund them and put them
[2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:47.440]  in office, the Banking Cartel School for Judas Goats, if we wanted to be free and break
[2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:51.840]  their trance, they put us under and we'd get a billion views, but instead we'll probably
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:58.000]  get a half million, okay, we'll keep fighting uphill, even though we have the keys to the
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:01.200]  criminal mafia.
[2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:08.280]  You know, if you go back to the early 1950s, La Cosa Nostra had reportedly blackmailed the
[2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:12.320]  head of the FBI and others, but regardless of whether that was true, Congress would not
[2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:18.160]  say that organized crime existed, it didn't exist, there was no organized group out there
[2:07:18.160 --> 2:07:26.840]  organizing crimes until finally the FBI was able to record a bunch of mafia dons in Vermont
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:36.080]  meeting at a ski lodge together in one big hall while drinking cognac and eating mistakes.
[2:07:36.080 --> 2:07:42.320]  And that was really just the FBI mafia getting big for its britches and stepping up and standing
[2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:48.000]  up to one of the other organized crime syndicates that it thought had gotten a little uppity
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.320]  or a little big for its britches.
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:55.040]  But there were hearings in the 40s and 50s where Jagger Hoover, you can look this up,
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:08:01.840]  would get up there and say, there is no such thing as La Cosa Nostra or our thing or the
[2:08:01.840 --> 2:08:02.840]  mafia.
[2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:06.760]  Now, you don't think members of Congress didn't know it was real, they were getting
[2:08:06.760 --> 2:08:08.440]  paid off and were part of it.
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:11.120]  You don't think the Senate didn't know, you don't think the President didn't know, you
[2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:13.440]  don't think they, no, no, no.
[2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:16.920]  They like to use those operations to commit crimes they wanted done.
[2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:21.400]  They were the real mafia above it, just like Mario Puzo's The Godfather, which is a composite
[2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:25.600]  of three stories, says, you know, I was hoping Michael someday it'd be you that pulled the
[2:08:25.600 --> 2:08:32.960]  strings, Senator Collion, President Collion, oh, like, we'll get there, Pop.
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:38.000]  See, the mafia wasn't the real mafia, they wanted to get to the real mafia in the Senate,
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.880]  in the presidency.
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:43.240]  We'll get there, Pop.
[2:08:43.240 --> 2:08:44.480]  We'll get there.
[2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:49.440]  Well, let me tell you, Jeffrey Epstein got there, it's a bunch of pedophile devil worshipers.
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:51.480]  You don't want to get there.
[2:08:51.480 --> 2:08:54.240]  They tried to make me a made man of their system.
[2:08:54.240 --> 2:08:57.560]  God just don't thank you, let the door hit you on the ass.
[2:08:57.560 --> 2:09:00.680]  My soul is already been made by Jesus Christ.
[2:09:00.680 --> 2:09:02.240]  That's who I'm with.
[2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:03.840]  That's my Don in the sky.
[2:09:03.840 --> 2:09:04.840]  That's my boss.
[2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:08.480]  He gives the orders, I follow him and don't question it.
[2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:14.520]  So again, the idea that, and I'm not knocking the Italian mafia or saying they weren't organized
[2:09:14.520 --> 2:09:20.200]  and make a bunch of money, they got very organized and started challenging the British royalty
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:24.920]  globalist Anglo-Saxon Jewish mafia.
[2:09:24.920 --> 2:09:28.880]  Every time I talk about this, people freak out, oh, he's being anti-Semitic, the ADL
[2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:29.880]  says.
[2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:32.000]  The ADL was founded by the Jewish mafia.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:36.240]  Jews are great people, Italians are great people, Germans are great people, but they've
[2:09:36.240 --> 2:09:37.240]  got mafias.
[2:09:37.240 --> 2:09:42.640]  And that's what the ADL is, is the Jewish mob.
[2:09:42.640 --> 2:09:49.120]  And so what a great trick they did in telling us that only Italians have organized crime,
[2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:54.720]  that only Italians organize organizations and groups, and then had Hollywood tell us
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:10:01.120]  all that Italians are criminals, and next they told us blacks were criminals.
[2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:03.920]  And then black folks saw that and thought, hell, these guys are making money doing great
[2:10:03.920 --> 2:10:05.800]  and all these movies, I should become a gangster.
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:10.120]  That was all directed in the 70s and 80s and 90s by Hollywood.
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:14.120]  And the crime rate in the black community went from lower than in the white community
[2:10:14.120 --> 2:10:19.400]  to the highest ever seen in the United States.
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:24.600]  A black person, a black male is 10 to 20 depending on the area, times likely to come into crime
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:25.600]  in the other group.
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:32.160]  They flip those numbers with their mind control, with their brainwashing, with their programming.
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:33.160]  That's the same thing.
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:36.920]  No, the mafia and the criminals is the National Education Association.
[2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:39.040]  The mafia and the criminals is the CIA.
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:41.680]  The mafia and the criminals is the Democratic Party.
[2:10:41.680 --> 2:10:46.800]  The mafia and the criminals are the Davos group and the Bilderberg group and the British
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:52.360]  Royal Family and the New World Order.
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:53.880]  They're the mafia.
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:58.520]  And these aren't mafias that are just trying to sell you some booze or some drugs, that's
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:10:59.520]  bad enough.
[2:10:59.520 --> 2:11:02.800]  They're mafias that want to set you up.
[2:11:02.800 --> 2:11:05.640]  And what do they do in the Godfather too, based on real stories that happened out in
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:11.360]  Nevada, but composites, where they change the names, so only the guilty are protected.
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:17.280]  The senator won't do the deal to give the gaming license to Michael Carleone, so what
[2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:18.280]  does he do?
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:23.520]  Well, they wait until he gets drunk and is banging a hooker and they kill the hooker.
[2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:27.520]  That's when you know Michael isn't his dad, because Don Carleone wouldn't kill a woman
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:30.880]  to set somebody up, but Michael will.
[2:11:30.880 --> 2:11:33.160]  That's why Michael's in charge.
[2:11:33.160 --> 2:11:35.840]  And that's the whole message is that's how you go up the hierarchy.
[2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:40.920]  Now Michael Carleone orders a woman killed and put in a bed with the scumbag senator
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:42.480]  so he wins.
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:43.480]  He shows that senator.
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:45.200]  Next, he's got to kill his brother.
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:48.240]  See how it very sophisticated Mario Puzo's writing.
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:50.360]  The books are way better than the movies.
[2:11:50.360 --> 2:11:51.640]  The composites are real stuff.
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:52.640]  Now you got to kill your brother.
[2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:54.400]  Oh, you killed some innocent woman.
[2:11:54.400 --> 2:11:55.880]  Next it's your brother.
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:11:59.560]  And then your wife kills your son.
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:02.200]  You kill an innocent whore.
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:07.800]  Now you got to kill your brother and your wife kills your son.
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:10.560]  See how it works?
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:11.560]  That's writing.
[2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:12.560]  That's sophistication.
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:14.840]  Who reads Mario Puzo and gets all the points?
[2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:15.840]  Almost nobody.
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:16.840]  But you just got it from me.
[2:12:16.840 --> 2:12:22.040]  That's why I can read it dozens of times, because it's so powerful.
[2:12:22.040 --> 2:12:29.560]  So I've just done a long rant about the Italian mafia and how they were chosen for destruction
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:33.400]  just because they kind of gave the establishment a little run for their money.
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:35.240]  Oh, you're getting up and eat?
[2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:38.680]  Oh, you black people run your own businesses, run your own shopping malls, your own banks?
[2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:42.400]  How about we ship some cocaine into your neighborhood?
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:43.960]  And who are these predators?
[2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:45.520]  Who are the people that are doing it?
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:48.400]  Who are the ones shipping fentanyl in to kill us all now?
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:51.640]  It's this guy right here.
[2:12:51.640 --> 2:12:52.640]  It's these people.
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:54.120]  They think it's all funny.
[2:12:54.120 --> 2:12:58.480]  They think it's all cute because they don't follow any rules.
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:00.320]  They'll kill the hooker to set you up.
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:03.360]  They'll kill their brother if he gets in the way.
[2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:07.600]  And none of them even have kids anymore because they don't even believe in that, so you don't
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:08.800]  have to leverage on them.
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:11.240]  They're like, oh, you're going to kill my kid?
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:12.240]  I killed my kid.
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:17.720]  I decided not to have him.
[2:13:17.720 --> 2:13:19.200]  I'm the winner.
[2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:22.480]  I'm more evil than anybody.
[2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:28.120]  So Don Corleone dies in his backyard with his grandson in a tomato farm having fun.
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:29.920]  You die alone with Satan.
[2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:30.920]  That's the message.
[2:13:30.920 --> 2:13:31.920]  And that's where I come from.
[2:13:31.920 --> 2:13:33.760]  I'm not part of you pedophiles.
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:35.240]  I'm not part of your crap.
[2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:39.080]  I'm not using all your dark energy and all your twisted stuff that you think killing
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:41.480]  innocent people and killing women and children.
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:42.480]  It's tough.
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:43.480]  No.
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:44.480]  That's not tough.
[2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:45.480]  That's what losers do.
[2:13:45.480 --> 2:13:47.520]  That's what pieces of crap do.
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:49.680]  That's what you do.
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:52.720]  And at the end of the day, it's going to be you swinging from a rope.
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:56.360]  It's going to be you begging for mommy because there are a lot of people on this planet that
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:00.840]  aren't sold out to your Satanism and who know that it's God's mission for us to defeat
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:01.840]  you.
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:06.000]  All right, I said, I hit the big news on this front and I didn't yet in this segment because
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.520]  I'm out of control.
[2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:12.280]  And as much as I hate coming on here on air because I don't rob banks and I don't run
[2:14:12.280 --> 2:14:17.400]  whorehouses and I don't get my money from from from from Clouse Schwab or Bill Gates
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:21.760]  or Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger or any of these devils.
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:25.200]  I get it from you and I need money to keep this operation going.
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:28.240]  And when has there ever been a horse you bet on gave you this much results?
[2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:29.960]  And I'm not even sitting here bragging.
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:34.960]  I'm nervous as hell and, you know, going into my thousandth stretch of the fight here.
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:39.460]  I've never been stronger, but I need dollar signs to run this platform in the face of
[2:14:39.460 --> 2:14:43.280]  incredible attacks, which we expect in the minute we're supposed to be defeated.

[2:16:57.960 --> 2:17:03.260]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[2:17:03.260 --> 2:17:08.520]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[2:17:08.520 --> 2:17:15.480]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[2:17:15.480 --> 2:17:21.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[2:17:21.400 --> 2:17:24.760]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[2:17:24.760 --> 2:17:29.760]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[2:17:29.760 --> 2:17:34.920]  of this research, a fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:35.920]  symptoms.
[2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:41.480]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact current research
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:46.360]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:50.120]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:55.720]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe, head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of
[2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:59.720]  our pollen block chewable tablets.
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:01.720]  What are champions made of?
[2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:10.720]  Here's a man who can show you.
[2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:40.540]  Chewable tablet is the notable version of наш Ireland's
[2:18:40.540 --> 2:19:01.300]  This is a great sponsor.

[2:19:27.380 --> 2:19:30.220]  at infowarsphone.com.

[2:19:32.420 --> 2:19:33.420]  These aren't.
[2:19:33.420 --> 2:19:34.820]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[2:19:34.820 --> 2:19:40.620]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes, so the calls you were free
[2:19:40.620 --> 2:19:44.420]  or took a regular cell phone, you're not being tracked or traced, and I keep one in my car.
[2:19:44.420 --> 2:19:47.700]  I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[2:19:47.700 --> 2:19:48.700]  don't work.
[2:19:48.700 --> 2:19:49.700]  They work.
[2:19:49.700 --> 2:19:59.140]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[2:19:59.140 --> 2:20:06.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:06.140 --> 2:20:15.260]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[2:20:15.260 --> 2:20:20.820]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got
[2:20:20.820 --> 2:20:21.820]  one.
[2:20:21.820 --> 2:20:39.260]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:39.260 --> 2:20:46.620]  Like millions of us must be feeling worldwide, economist Ernest Wolfe believes a hidden alliance
[2:20:46.620 --> 2:20:53.300]  of political and corporate leaders are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of crashing
[2:20:53.300 --> 2:20:58.340]  their economies and making way for a global digital currency.
[2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:03.860]  Wolfe has been researching the history of Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum
[2:21:03.860 --> 2:21:08.020]  and has found a very fundamental piece of their criminal puzzle.
[2:21:08.020 --> 2:21:13.820]  The young global leaders school established and managed by Klaus Schwab.
[2:21:13.820 --> 2:21:19.780]  The World Economic Forum, originally called the European Management Forum, brought together
[2:21:19.780 --> 2:21:27.500]  31 nations at its very first meeting in 1971 and is currently funded by a thousand multinational
[2:21:27.500 --> 2:21:29.260]  corporations.
[2:21:29.260 --> 2:21:33.480]  Klaus Schwab hadn't really accomplished much in economics.
[2:21:33.480 --> 2:21:38.300]  His father made weapons for the Nazis and he trained under Henry Kissinger at the Harvard
[2:21:38.300 --> 2:21:44.340]  Business School, which is where he was likely tapped to be the face of the World Economic
[2:21:44.340 --> 2:21:45.340]  Forum.
[2:21:45.340 --> 2:21:51.060]  In 1992, Schwab established the Global Leaders for Tomorrow School, which was reestablished
[2:21:51.060 --> 2:21:54.740]  as the young global leaders in 2004.
[2:21:54.740 --> 2:21:58.900]  Attendees must officially apply for admission and be selected.
[2:21:58.900 --> 2:22:07.980]  Alumni of the school's very first class include Angela Merkel, Nicholas Sarkozy and Tony Blair.
[2:22:07.980 --> 2:22:13.100]  Other attendees include Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.
[2:22:13.100 --> 2:22:16.260]  The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern.
[2:22:16.260 --> 2:22:19.780]  So long as there's people who are eligible who haven't been vaccinated, we've got work
[2:22:19.780 --> 2:22:20.780]  to do.
[2:22:20.780 --> 2:22:23.540]  You know, I don't think I'll ever be satisfied so long as there's someone who's choose,
[2:22:23.540 --> 2:22:26.260]  you know, who is eligible and hasn't been.
[2:22:26.260 --> 2:22:29.060]  And that's why I've said this, but it's not going to be an end point to this vaccination
[2:22:29.060 --> 2:22:30.060]  program.
[2:22:30.060 --> 2:22:36.060]  President of France, Emmanuel Macron, Governor of California, Gavin Newsom.
[2:22:36.060 --> 2:22:39.780]  That's why we recognize our responsibility to do more, and that's what we are announcing
[2:22:39.780 --> 2:22:40.940]  here today.
[2:22:40.940 --> 2:22:50.260]  A statewide requirement for in-person instruction for all of our children to add to a well-established
[2:22:50.260 --> 2:22:56.740]  list that currently includes 10 vaccinations and well-established rules and regulations
[2:22:56.740 --> 2:23:03.060]  that have been advanced by the legislature for decades to add to that list, the vaccination.
[2:23:03.060 --> 2:23:08.060]  U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg.
[2:23:08.060 --> 2:23:13.700]  Other attendees of the young global leaders include Virgins Richard Branson, the Clinton
[2:23:13.700 --> 2:23:19.140]  Foundations Chelsea Clinton, and Black Rocks Larry Fink.
[2:23:19.140 --> 2:23:27.140]  Approximately 1,300 global leaders have attended the school from North America, Asia, Africa,
[2:23:27.140 --> 2:23:32.540]  and South America, most of whom are all pushing the same criminal hoax.
[2:23:32.540 --> 2:23:37.100]  The lockdowns and the deadly experimental jabs.
[2:23:37.100 --> 2:23:42.020]  These are the foot soldiers bringing about the angry world that Klaus Schwab talked about.
[2:23:42.020 --> 2:23:48.780]  I don't know how it will play out in November, but what we know is that we will end up with
[2:23:48.780 --> 2:23:55.580]  many more unemployed, and particularly also people in the gray economy, which are not
[2:23:55.580 --> 2:23:58.380]  counted for who lose their jobs.
[2:23:58.380 --> 2:24:06.500]  So we will see definitely a lot of anger already now, but probably increased by the end of
[2:24:06.500 --> 2:24:14.100]  the year because this crisis will be with us until we really have found remedy.
[2:24:14.100 --> 2:24:17.740]  So we have to prepare for a more angry world.
[2:24:17.740 --> 2:24:22.580]  So that his masters can bring about their one-world government system.
[2:24:22.580 --> 2:24:28.860]  And in 2012, Klaus Schwab began the global shapers community, which has groomed an army
[2:24:28.860 --> 2:24:35.140]  of 10,000 young people to be the next group of saboteurs around the world, currently holding
[2:24:35.140 --> 2:25:01.540]  meetings in 400 cities worldwide.
[2:25:01.540 --> 2:25:05.060]  This is the real mafia.
[2:25:05.060 --> 2:25:07.620]  This is the real criminal group.
[2:25:07.620 --> 2:25:11.740]  And they are artificially shutting off the industry, shutting off the society because
[2:25:11.740 --> 2:25:16.620]  the capitalist system produced so much wealth and power it produced a big population.
[2:25:16.620 --> 2:25:18.780]  Well, they said they don't want a big population.
[2:25:18.780 --> 2:25:20.820]  You can say, well, maybe there are too many people.
[2:25:20.820 --> 2:25:23.540]  They've programmed you to say that, whether it's true or not.
[2:25:23.540 --> 2:25:26.700]  We are overpopulated in some areas of the technologies we have, but we can deal with
[2:25:26.700 --> 2:25:28.340]  that in different ways.
[2:25:28.340 --> 2:25:35.180]  This is not honest, and this is run by really evil people who use pedophilia for control.
[2:25:35.180 --> 2:25:41.580]  So anybody that is raping and killing children at a high level is not supposed to run anything
[2:25:41.580 --> 2:25:42.580]  or at a low level.
[2:25:42.580 --> 2:25:46.820]  What I'm saying is they're at a high level doing this at a very sophisticated level because
[2:25:46.820 --> 2:25:50.820]  their religion is about giving up their humanity and giving up their empathy.
[2:25:50.820 --> 2:25:52.020]  They believe that strength.
[2:25:52.020 --> 2:25:54.300]  Oh, but they've got to be protected.
[2:25:54.300 --> 2:25:55.700]  They've got to be pampered.
[2:25:55.700 --> 2:25:56.700]  They're important.
[2:25:56.700 --> 2:26:02.460]  So I say you're not important, and you're all going to end up like Jeffrey Epstein.
[2:26:02.460 --> 2:26:07.100]  Just a bunch of gross, weird men acting tough.
[2:26:07.100 --> 2:26:10.460]  It's disgusting.
[2:26:10.460 --> 2:26:15.100]  Brian Stelter is disgusting.
[2:26:15.100 --> 2:26:16.420]  Chris Cuomo is disgusting.
[2:26:16.420 --> 2:26:17.420]  Hillary Clinton is disgusting.
[2:26:17.420 --> 2:26:21.260]  I mean, again, I've shown this a thousand times.
[2:26:21.260 --> 2:26:26.780]  Hillary Clinton, out of college, after the Watergate Committee, asked for a job in Little
[2:26:26.780 --> 2:26:33.300]  Rock, Arkansas, working for the Dixie Mafia, and they had so many cases of them raping
[2:26:33.300 --> 2:26:39.100]  little girls and committing crimes that she asked for the worst jobs for the mafia.
[2:26:39.100 --> 2:26:45.100]  When I say Dixie Mafia, that was their territory, but it was mafia from all over the United
[2:26:45.100 --> 2:26:54.380]  States, as far north as Delaware, and New York City, and Boston, and the Midwest, Illinois,
[2:26:54.380 --> 2:27:02.380]  Nevada, Dallas, and they would all go to Little Rock and Hot Springs, and this is on record.
[2:27:02.380 --> 2:27:08.220]  And she was 25 years old working for these people.
[2:27:08.220 --> 2:27:11.420]  If you want your daughter to really get accelerated into the New World Order, that's how you do
[2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:12.420]  it.
[2:27:12.420 --> 2:27:16.220]  These cases were kidnappers of little girls.
[2:27:16.220 --> 2:27:17.300]  I've interviewed some of those women.
[2:27:17.300 --> 2:27:21.860]  I've sat there with them having lunch with their broken, smashed faces, smashed in by
[2:27:21.860 --> 2:27:22.860]  the men.
[2:27:22.860 --> 2:27:34.420]  They could never have babies because they raped them so hard with a mop handle that
[2:27:34.420 --> 2:27:39.380]  their uterus fell out on the ground.
[2:27:39.380 --> 2:27:43.660]  And Hillary made, there's articles about it on the screen, made jokes about it.
[2:27:43.660 --> 2:27:45.700]  You're like, well, that's the most horrible thing I can imagine.
[2:27:45.700 --> 2:27:49.460]  That's how you become a made man in the New World Order, is you grab a 10-year-old girl
[2:27:49.460 --> 2:27:55.300]  off a bicycle, and you rape her for two days in a drunken stupor in some rich guy's cabin,
[2:27:55.300 --> 2:28:05.020]  and then you rape her out with a mop handle because you're in charge, and you are the
[2:28:05.020 --> 2:28:08.820]  best person, and you're going to ruin a young woman's life.
[2:28:08.820 --> 2:28:14.900]  You're going to satanically take everything you've got from them because you are Hillary
[2:28:14.900 --> 2:28:22.580]  Clinton, the pig, whose father was the number two mafia chief under Mayor Daley.
[2:28:22.580 --> 2:28:26.580]  Oh, but I'm sorry, his name's Daley.
[2:28:26.580 --> 2:28:28.500]  There's no mafia with a last name like Daley.
[2:28:28.500 --> 2:28:29.500]  I'm sorry.
[2:28:29.500 --> 2:28:34.020]  If it had been like Luigi, then it would have been okay, but it doesn't exist.
[2:28:34.020 --> 2:28:35.020]  That's right.
[2:28:35.020 --> 2:29:01.980]  If you're concerned about the power grid, so this could be literally your last chance
[2:29:01.980 --> 2:29:30.780]  with
[2:29:30.780 --> 2:29:34.340]  You get a free DVD with two films on it about Bohemian growth.
[2:29:34.340 --> 2:29:37.380]  Turbo, Force, 10-Hour Clean Energy, 40% off.
[2:29:37.380 --> 2:29:40.700]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 40% off.
[2:29:40.700 --> 2:29:44.900]  DNA Force Plus, the world's Royce for your cells and immune systems.
[2:29:44.900 --> 2:29:46.140]  40% off.
[2:29:46.140 --> 2:29:50.060]  InfoWarsStore.com, this could be potentially your last chance
[2:29:50.060 --> 2:29:53.500]  to get a t-shirt, a book, a film, or these great supplements.
[2:29:53.500 --> 2:29:57.980]  We're going to keep going 110%, but we need your support.
[2:29:57.980 --> 2:30:03.380]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[2:30:03.380 --> 2:30:09.300]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly, and debilitating experimental injection
[2:30:09.300 --> 2:30:13.460]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:18.660]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population
[2:30:18.660 --> 2:30:23.420]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[2:30:23.420 --> 2:30:27.620]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening,
[2:30:27.620 --> 2:30:30.300]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[2:30:30.300 --> 2:30:32.820]  But there is only two things to do.
[2:30:32.820 --> 2:30:35.940]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:30:35.940 --> 2:30:39.300]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[2:30:39.300 --> 2:30:43.940]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to
[2:30:43.940 --> 2:30:44.940]  an end.
[2:30:44.940 --> 2:30:50.340]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration,
[2:30:50.340 --> 2:30:57.420]  survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:57.420 --> 2:31:01.980]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in infowar's live products, and that's
[2:31:01.980 --> 2:31:05.420]  why for more than two years, we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[2:31:05.420 --> 2:31:10.420]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now, and we have reformulated and not
[2:31:10.420 --> 2:31:14.980]  just used the same ingredients, we've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[2:31:14.980 --> 2:31:18.820]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[2:31:18.820 --> 2:31:20.140]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[2:31:20.140 --> 2:31:25.180]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[2:31:25.180 --> 2:31:30.100]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and
[2:31:30.100 --> 2:31:34.700]  a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbocharge your body with antioxidants.
[2:31:34.700 --> 2:31:38.260]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium
[2:31:38.260 --> 2:31:39.260]  added.

[2:31:45.860 --> 2:31:47.740]  sea salt, and it just goes on and on.

[2:32:59.580 --> 2:33:09.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:09.380 --> 2:33:14.140]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:15.860]  You want to stop tyranny?
[2:33:15.860 --> 2:33:26.460]  Well so does he, live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:30.940]  I need you to sign up at infowarstore.com for resetwars.com.
[2:33:30.940 --> 2:33:35.900]  I need you to take your mind to the next level to defeat the globalist.
[2:33:35.900 --> 2:33:41.380]  I need you to purchase this to also fund the info war, it's a 360 win, and it's at resetwars.com.
[2:33:41.380 --> 2:33:44.660]  We're about to lay out for the first time exclusively what's in the course here in a
[2:33:44.660 --> 2:33:56.220]  moment, but first, 2022 is the year of the tiger.
[2:33:56.220 --> 2:34:02.180]  The Communist Chinese haven't thrown away all of the ancient mysticism and folklore
[2:34:02.180 --> 2:34:06.820]  of China, and they really go off of these archetypal years, and they believe the best
[2:34:06.820 --> 2:34:11.700]  years to launch a war or to launch a new endeavor are the dragon and the tiger.
[2:34:11.700 --> 2:34:15.220]  But the dragon and their lore can be seen as turning against you, and though it gives
[2:34:15.220 --> 2:34:20.020]  you great power in that year to launch a war, sometimes the dragon can be a trickster.
[2:34:20.020 --> 2:34:25.780]  But the tiger is never a trickster, and is the second most powerful creature on the Chinese
[2:34:25.780 --> 2:34:29.300]  zodiac, and their leaders really believe in this stuff.
[2:34:29.300 --> 2:34:33.620]  Well it just so happens that I'm year of the tiger, next year as well, and that's my sign,
[2:34:33.620 --> 2:34:39.180]  so maybe there is something to it, but probably not, regardless in their minds there is.
[2:34:39.180 --> 2:34:43.740]  And it's all about what your mind believes, it's all about the confines we put over our
[2:34:43.740 --> 2:34:49.340]  minds that limit us, and so that's why superstitions like what year or your zodiac are so important
[2:34:49.340 --> 2:34:50.340]  even to world leaders.
[2:34:50.340 --> 2:34:54.900]  Hitler was obsessed with stuff like that, Napoleon, Julius Caesar, and so many others,
[2:34:54.900 --> 2:34:58.940]  because by believing in the stars, it allows them to actually believe in themselves, and
[2:34:58.940 --> 2:35:01.700]  this goes into the false constructs and mind control.
[2:35:01.700 --> 2:35:07.500]  So this is the year of the tiger, 2022 that we're going into, and I want everybody to
[2:35:07.500 --> 2:35:10.780]  get the latest information on how we're fighting back and how we're breaking our conditioning
[2:35:10.780 --> 2:35:13.480]  together at resetwars.com.
[2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:17.780]  Resetwars is now live, the course is now available, thousands of people have signed up, we're
[2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:22.500]  getting rave reviews back, and there's 25% off running right now for just a few more
[2:35:22.500 --> 2:35:23.500]  days.
[2:35:23.500 --> 2:35:38.140]  We're about to leave 2021 and go to 2022, the year of the tiger and resetwars.com.
[2:35:38.140 --> 2:35:44.100]  The world is changing, history is happening now.
[2:35:44.100 --> 2:35:49.940]  The Great Reset is a corporate assault on humanity, a total consolidation over every
[2:35:49.940 --> 2:35:56.220]  aspect of our lives, but we have the answer to respond to the Great Reset.
[2:35:56.220 --> 2:36:03.980]  It's called resetwars, and it is the combined knowledge of my 28 years on air, understanding
[2:36:03.980 --> 2:36:07.540]  how the new world order operates and how to stop them.
[2:36:07.540 --> 2:36:09.060]  Now is the time to be part of history.
[2:36:09.060 --> 2:36:14.580]  If you wait six months or a year to get involved, the situation's going to be a lot worse than
[2:36:14.580 --> 2:36:15.580]  it is now.
[2:36:15.580 --> 2:36:20.540]  We have a narrow window to really take on the globalist during their attempt to take
[2:36:20.540 --> 2:36:21.540]  over the planet.
[2:36:21.540 --> 2:36:23.940]  They've launched their main offensive.
[2:36:23.940 --> 2:36:27.820]  Once they get their casual society tracker system in place, it's going to be very hard
[2:36:27.820 --> 2:36:29.740]  to get out from under their thumb.
[2:36:29.740 --> 2:36:33.140]  But humanity is waking up all over the world, and there are millions of people every day
[2:36:33.140 --> 2:36:38.460]  protesting against the COVID-19 U.N. takeover, which is again the main fear weapon of the
[2:36:38.460 --> 2:36:40.260]  Great Reset in their own words.
[2:36:40.260 --> 2:36:43.900]  Koshwab, the head of the Davos Group, who's launched this program, says that you will
[2:36:43.900 --> 2:36:47.340]  have to have a microchip under your skin to buy and sell soon as part of your vaccine
[2:36:47.340 --> 2:36:48.840]  passport.
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:50.700]  This isn't tyranny that's coming.
[2:36:50.700 --> 2:36:51.700]  It's here.
[2:36:51.700 --> 2:36:56.060]  And resetwars enables you to not let them demoralize you or break your will.
[2:36:56.060 --> 2:36:57.460]  People ask, why am I will so strong?
[2:36:57.460 --> 2:37:00.820]  Well, it's this information that's allowed me to stand against them.
[2:37:00.820 --> 2:37:05.660]  It's this information that God put in all of us that is our shield, our armor, our sword
[2:37:05.660 --> 2:37:07.380]  against this fraud.
[2:37:07.380 --> 2:37:13.340]  So I want to invite you all now to be part of history and to join me at resetwars.com.
[2:37:13.340 --> 2:37:17.740]  Resetwars is now live, ladies and gentlemen, as we prepare to go into the year 2022, such
[2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:21.860]  a critical year in these midterm elections, now more than ever, you have to realize the
[2:37:21.860 --> 2:37:24.140]  innate power you have.
[2:37:24.140 --> 2:37:27.900]  When you also go to resetwars.com and sign up for the course, you'll learn about a whole
[2:37:27.900 --> 2:37:32.300]  new system that we're building that only members will have access to.
[2:37:32.300 --> 2:37:37.980]  So this is the gateway to a wider world and literally to connecting to the divine and
[2:37:37.980 --> 2:37:38.980]  beyond.
[2:37:38.980 --> 2:37:41.260]  It is resetwars.com.
[2:37:41.260 --> 2:37:43.980]  The course is now live, history is now happening.
[2:37:43.980 --> 2:37:47.180]  You also fund the M4 when you do this, so it's a 360 win.
[2:37:47.180 --> 2:37:51.220]  Thank you all for your past support and join me now at resetwars.com.
[2:37:51.220 --> 2:37:55.660]  This information is critical that people actually research it, discover how real it is and then
[2:37:55.660 --> 2:37:57.100]  teach others.
[2:37:57.100 --> 2:37:59.900]  This is the secret weapon to break out of their matrix-like system.
[2:37:59.900 --> 2:38:02.020]  Secondarily, M4 Wars needs funding.
[2:38:02.020 --> 2:38:05.580]  We're launching some major new projects in the near future in just a few months.
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:09.580]  We've got all these globalist attacks happening right now, 2022 is the year they're trying
[2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:12.340]  to sew up the new world order and take everybody down.
[2:38:12.340 --> 2:38:16.940]  So I need a lot of capital and so the price of the course will go to keep us on air.
[2:38:16.940 --> 2:38:20.060]  So I want to thank you all for your past support and I want to encourage you all now to realize
[2:38:20.060 --> 2:38:23.180]  how far we've come together and what we've been through together.
[2:38:23.180 --> 2:38:28.100]  We don't want all that work to just be thrown away to the side right at the point of its
[2:38:28.100 --> 2:38:30.180]  culmination and our greatest victories.
[2:38:30.180 --> 2:38:32.060]  So thank you all for your support.
[2:38:32.060 --> 2:38:36.620]  Please continue to visit M4WarsStore.com for all the great products, books, films, t-shirts,
[2:38:36.620 --> 2:38:37.620]  you name it.

[2:38:43.780 --> 2:38:48.420]  Again, we're not funded by George Soros and the globalist police support our local AM&FM
[2:38:48.420 --> 2:38:52.780]  stations and TV stations as well and at one part of me feels guilty just marketing, marketing,
[2:38:52.780 --> 2:38:54.900]  marketing, but we built our own independent system.
[2:38:54.900 --> 2:38:58.940]  We've built servers that are now underground that are now just been fired up so when they
[2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:01.020]  tried to take us down we were able to boot up.
[2:39:01.020 --> 2:39:04.340]  We've had to do so much more, I can't tell you, we had to build everything ourselves.
[2:39:04.340 --> 2:39:11.260]  It cost more than $50 million the last four years would be platforming everything we had
[2:39:11.260 --> 2:39:16.100]  and then I was out of money so I started putting my house on sale six months ago, finally sold
[2:39:16.100 --> 2:39:17.940]  it right when I needed the money.
[2:39:17.940 --> 2:39:23.700]  So sold my house and I'm just totally in because we're supposed to stay on air in 2022 the
[2:39:23.700 --> 2:39:24.700]  year of the tiger.
[2:39:24.700 --> 2:39:29.940]  I mean it's on so thank you and I appreciate you and I just want you to keep us on air.
[2:39:29.940 --> 2:39:33.220]  Now if you just went and bought the course and funded us that's a great thing you did
[2:39:33.220 --> 2:39:38.660]  but this is the most game changing info where I'm actually calm and go over it and all the
[2:39:38.660 --> 2:39:39.660]  documents.
[2:39:39.660 --> 2:39:43.460]  So I asked Jake Ducey who helped me put this together for recentwars.com and he'll be
[2:39:43.460 --> 2:39:45.700]  hosting in the next hour, I'll host some with him.
[2:39:45.700 --> 2:39:47.020]  This is a long report he wrote up.
[2:39:47.020 --> 2:39:49.980]  I said well you please because he's good at writing and getting some together and I'm
[2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:50.980]  not.
[2:39:50.980 --> 2:39:54.660]  Well you go through all my crazy notes in the film and in the classes it's really a
[2:39:54.660 --> 2:39:59.420]  six hour plus documentary and give people a prelude of actually what's in there.
[2:39:59.420 --> 2:40:02.100]  So I'll try to shut up right now and have you go through this.
[2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:07.260]  Yeah well first of all before I do that I just want to thank you for being committed
[2:40:07.260 --> 2:40:09.860]  to the long term to put together something like Reset Wars.
[2:40:09.860 --> 2:40:14.580]  I know many of your audience sincerely appreciates it and it's an all new part of what you're
[2:40:14.580 --> 2:40:15.580]  doing.
[2:40:15.580 --> 2:40:19.780]  I got a bunch of Instagram messages and emails of people saying hey I just went through everything
[2:40:19.780 --> 2:40:22.100]  and I just want to say thanks for encouraging Alex Ducey.
[2:40:22.100 --> 2:40:24.860]  Oh yeah the reviews are great and that's what matters to me is what you think.
[2:40:24.860 --> 2:40:29.100]  Because I know this is powerful, I know this is the key but did I present it correctly?
[2:40:29.100 --> 2:40:34.580]  Yeah and there's nothing like having fire you know and nobody knows what fire is yet
[2:40:34.580 --> 2:40:37.220]  and you're like trying to give people the next level and I'm sorry to say folks this
[2:40:37.220 --> 2:40:41.460]  is like as important as our discovery and harnessing of fire and I'm like sitting here
[2:40:41.460 --> 2:40:44.780]  saying hey we got this thing and I just folks I'm not a BS or I just hope you listen to
[2:40:44.780 --> 2:40:45.780]  us.
[2:40:45.780 --> 2:40:50.180]  Yeah and you know obviously Info Wars needs the funding it's an important but this is
[2:40:50.180 --> 2:40:51.940]  one of the best things we did in a minute.

[2:41:18.900 --> 2:41:19.900]  Five people out?
[2:41:19.900 --> 2:41:20.900]  All right.
[2:41:20.900 --> 2:41:23.980]  Yeah no no the people that sign up at the first of this it's already available now we're
[2:41:23.980 --> 2:41:27.500]  going to fly five people out here we're going to do a special I'm already I'm going to launch

[2:41:31.020 --> 2:41:34.940]  whole new game changing direct private stuff that they can't stop.
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:39.340]  So I'm going to get into those bonuses that's five times better than I thought literally
[2:41:39.340 --> 2:41:43.300]  he's going to fly out five people you submit a video testimony you buy the course right

[2:42:02.780 --> 2:42:06.180]  before 1159 answering your questions directly.
[2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:10.860]  So I'll get into those bonuses more but these are incredible opportunities and I want to
[2:42:10.860 --> 2:42:11.860]  get into a little bit.
[2:42:11.860 --> 2:42:15.540]  We're going to go to break but let's come back people want to know what's in the course
[2:42:15.540 --> 2:42:16.540]  yeah I got it.
[2:42:16.540 --> 2:42:20.020]  There's one thing to have MK ultra documents we know how to take what they're saying in
[2:42:20.020 --> 2:42:25.020]  the documents that's coded and decoded literally again people I don't BS okay God strike me
[2:42:25.020 --> 2:42:29.260]  down if I am this is I want you to know this is the tools if you actually research this
[2:42:29.260 --> 2:42:33.140]  and incorporate this and learn this you're either going to go completely crazy or you're
[2:42:33.140 --> 2:42:36.980]  going to become completely enlightened and it is kind of a little guilt even releasing
[2:42:36.980 --> 2:42:40.100]  this because the globalist don't want you to have this information.
[2:42:40.100 --> 2:42:43.740]  Yeah we know that for a fact so in the next segment last night I went through the entire
[2:42:43.740 --> 2:42:48.740]  course again for Alex to break down exactly what's in it will break down all the content
[2:42:48.740 --> 2:42:53.740]  this is about 1015 pages show you exactly what's in it Alex will fly you out reset

[2:43:00.820 --> 2:43:06.820]  everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity
[2:43:06.820 --> 2:43:11.980]  well that's why reset wars.com is so important not only is it a game changing course of critical
[2:43:11.980 --> 2:43:17.700]  information to unlock your mind from the matrix but it's something that gets around
[2:43:17.700 --> 2:43:24.660]  Paul Schwab's attempt to shut down American infrastructure and American jobs it is the
[2:43:24.660 --> 2:43:31.780]  true digital economy it's the spiritual economy of the mind and transcendent or control I've
[2:43:31.780 --> 2:43:38.300]  been on there 28 years and all of our work has been amazing thanks to God and God's divine
[2:43:38.300 --> 2:43:42.260]  empowerment and blessing but I got to tell you out of everything I've done reset wars
[2:43:42.260 --> 2:43:48.420]  is the most important and it is now available out of the month of December 2021 is here
[2:43:48.420 --> 2:43:55.340]  at reset wars.com start your journey to the next level today at reset wars.com the globalist
[2:43:55.340 --> 2:44:00.340]  fear this information the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still
[2:44:00.340 --> 2:44:06.740]  unaware that there's a war between three individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist
[2:44:06.740 --> 2:44:12.460]  on the other who are literally trying to create a post-human world for the United States of
[2:44:12.460 --> 2:44:16.740]  Brazil and of course triggered by the Brexit the UK nations were pulling out of the private
[2:44:16.740 --> 2:44:21.660]  corporate fascist world government that's why they launched their great reset and their
[2:44:21.660 --> 2:44:28.820]  program after collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down
[2:44:28.820 --> 2:44:33.780]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because
[2:44:33.780 --> 2:44:38.580]  we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this world government system
[2:44:38.580 --> 2:44:45.460]  could win they released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned
[2:44:45.460 --> 2:44:49.820]  about it about 20 months ago it's that simple they can't meet us because of our free speech
[2:44:49.820 --> 2:44:54.540]  and our guns so the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is
[2:44:54.540 --> 2:45:00.900]  history expose this paradigm and we win in late August in full war saw an explosion of
[2:45:00.900 --> 2:45:07.180]  orders because our audience understands that the globalist are destabilizing the planet
[2:45:07.180 --> 2:45:13.780]  by design and are attempting to cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide now ladies
[2:45:13.780 --> 2:45:17.260]  and gentlemen storeable food has always been something that's important to have it's a
[2:45:17.260 --> 2:45:21.980]  checkbox that everybody needs to have taking care of right along with water filtration
[2:45:21.980 --> 2:45:26.860]  self-defense and a relationship with God but now more than ever you need to get your storeable
[2:45:26.860 --> 2:45:31.540]  food orders in now we're ready to ship to you within 24 hours of your order it's high
[2:45:31.540 --> 2:45:36.820]  quality it's very very low cost at info or store dot com because in the future you're
[2:45:36.820 --> 2:45:41.260]  going to see more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases
[2:45:41.260 --> 2:45:45.980]  that are already taking place so lock in your storeable food now at a lower price and fund
[2:45:45.980 --> 2:45:51.220]  the info war at info or store dot com that's how you fight the great reset is by being
[2:45:51.220 --> 2:45:59.660]  self-sufficient and not under their control so get prepared now at info or store dot com
[2:45:59.660 --> 2:46:05.100]  are great a bag of it here I mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico
[2:46:05.100 --> 2:46:09.900]  the communists well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[2:46:09.900 --> 2:46:14.620]  above organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy it from
[2:46:14.620 --> 2:46:17.660]  the little farmers that you know the media calls communist but really they're just a
[2:46:17.660 --> 2:46:21.460]  commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the
[2:46:21.460 --> 2:46:24.820]  farmers don't let the Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican
[2:46:24.820 --> 2:46:28.020]  rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the
[2:46:28.020 --> 2:46:32.700]  same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[2:46:32.700 --> 2:46:35.780]  think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up america
[2:46:35.780 --> 2:46:44.420]  patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally in fact I'm gonna tell you a little story
[2:46:44.420 --> 2:46:51.380]  anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[2:46:51.380 --> 2:47:17.340]  find us you don't want to see that's fine leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[2:47:17.340 --> 2:47:24.180]  so if thanks to the grace of God we hadn't had such great effects and been the zeitgeist
[2:47:24.180 --> 2:47:29.500]  so many times I wouldn't expect you to believe me but I'm always faithful I'm always true
[2:47:29.500 --> 2:47:34.460]  and I know that if you take the information and reset wars and grasp it and really listen
[2:47:34.460 --> 2:47:39.020]  to it and really research it because in the six plus hours you can spend a year going
[2:47:39.020 --> 2:47:43.300]  into each little piece of it literally if you spend all day but if you actually grasp
[2:47:43.300 --> 2:47:47.860]  it it's the most valuable thing in the world better than an eight year education in my
[2:47:47.860 --> 2:47:54.380]  view and it's at resetwars.com right now 25% off until tomorrow at midnight but Jake let's
[2:47:54.380 --> 2:47:59.180]  get into it people want to know what's in the course go over just a quick snapshot of
[2:47:59.180 --> 2:48:03.860]  it so last night I was up till 2 3 a.m. I went back through the whole course for Alex
[2:48:03.860 --> 2:48:08.340]  he asked me to break down everything and just go straight so you know what you know what
[2:48:08.340 --> 2:48:15.620]  you're getting so we got chapter one is the mind wars and spirit wars because the reset
[2:48:15.620 --> 2:48:20.860]  wars course Alex actually decided to make it two courses and ones you're buying actually
[2:48:20.860 --> 2:48:26.540]  two courses the mind wars and the spirit wars so chapter one you're going to learn how the
[2:48:26.540 --> 2:48:33.460]  war on your mind is being waged and discover the five simple tricks you can use to protect
[2:48:33.460 --> 2:48:38.980]  yourself and your family this is all practical here so part number two learn how the war
[2:48:38.980 --> 2:48:45.340]  on your soul is being waged in the 11 biblical secrets to build a personal connection to
[2:48:45.340 --> 2:48:51.580]  God last part chapter one you'll discover three exercises you can easily do on a daily
[2:48:51.580 --> 2:48:56.780]  basis to raise your consciousness and protect yourself from the toxic negativity the mass
[2:48:56.780 --> 2:49:03.340]  media machine throws at you every day now one of my favorite chapters is chapter two Alex
[2:49:03.340 --> 2:49:08.180]  called this one beyond the great reset so as I was going back through everything last
[2:49:08.180 --> 2:49:14.740]  night my note says discover what the great reset is really about hint it has nothing
[2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:20.740]  to do with one world government it's even more sinister and if you do not learn you
[2:49:20.740 --> 2:49:26.580]  cannot protect yourself and your family this is really what Clash Wab and Mark Zuckerberg
[2:49:26.580 --> 2:49:32.420]  don't want you to know then Alex goes into the nature of reality in chapter three so
[2:49:32.420 --> 2:49:37.940]  chapter three is about uncovering the truth about the quantum physics the science of consciousness
[2:49:37.940 --> 2:49:43.580]  and the true nature of reality and Jake for me this is my favorite chapter I agree I and
[2:49:43.580 --> 2:49:47.180]  I really like chapter eight or nine when you when you get into God and close it all out
[2:49:47.180 --> 2:49:53.060]  there I mean yeah exactly but so you're going to learn how to apply this is huge here you're
[2:49:53.060 --> 2:49:59.540]  going to learn how to apply Nobel Prize winning physicist and mathematicians discoveries in
[2:49:59.540 --> 2:50:06.180]  order to create your own reality learn the hidden teachings of Albert Einstein and how
[2:50:06.180 --> 2:50:12.060]  to use them to master your consciousness you're going to see the scientific proof behind your
[2:50:12.060 --> 2:50:18.060]  connection to God and what the elite do to ruin this bond for you every single day and
[2:50:18.060 --> 2:50:21.340]  that's why this whole course is practical about protecting yourself your friends your
[2:50:21.340 --> 2:50:25.300]  family then laugh this is what daughters and they go talks about God consciousness you
[2:50:25.300 --> 2:50:30.820]  have it we're simply pointing out exercises to get there yep reconnect it's there God's
[2:50:30.820 --> 2:50:36.460]  knocking you got to open the door yeah this is all practical this is not theory that this

[2:50:42.140 --> 2:50:48.060]  to they're freaking out over this right now and so next next from chapter three you're

[2:55:59.660 --> 2:56:04.340]  is the term Alex coined in the course about trapping you in the mental and emotional plane
[2:56:04.340 --> 2:56:08.420]  and that's how they keep the matrix going so he shows how to break out of that you're

[2:56:48.020 --> 2:56:54.860]  will prepare for angry world but what Alex has done is broken down these very top level
[2:56:54.860 --> 2:57:00.540]  Nobel Prize winning physicist and mathematicians to use these laws of the universe energies
[2:57:00.540 --> 2:57:06.380]  never created or destroyed to take that energy of anger transmute it turn it into creativity
[2:57:06.380 --> 2:57:10.820]  for creative solutions ideas and then it doesn't happen immediately it logarithmically doubles

[3:07:39.780 --> 3:07:46.860]  and i really challenge alex and we're putting this together sometimes to to you know a disagreement
[3:07:46.860 --> 3:07:54.060]  here or there to make every single mini section as practical and applicable as humanly possible
[3:07:54.060 --> 3:07:58.260]  so you're not just saying i always just do stuff see to my pants we reshot a lot of
[3:07:58.260 --> 3:08:02.900]  this three four times yeah and and not just that this isn't just theory you're getting
[3:08:02.900 --> 3:08:08.700]  dozens and dozens and dozens of very specific things he never talks about on air exercises
[3:08:08.700 --> 3:08:13.380]  techniques tools that he does that he doesn't talk about on air there's a whole is all organic
[3:08:13.380 --> 3:08:18.860]  and and that's what we were codifying how organically was doing this yeah exactly and
[3:08:18.860 --> 3:08:25.740]  that's why i say and why i'm up here telling you how powerful this is and why this is so
[3:08:25.740 --> 3:08:31.060]  important because you're powerful yep and that's how we win this is really how you
[3:08:31.060 --> 3:08:35.380]  recognize you're powerful because god made you then you recognize god's plan you decide
[3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:38.820]  whether you're going to join that mission then you surrender yep and that's how we're
[3:08:38.820 --> 3:08:42.540]  going to win this thing and and believe me if you're depressed if you're stressed if
[3:08:42.540 --> 3:08:46.740]  you're anxious that's why it's called surrender because we've got our own plans we get it
[3:08:46.740 --> 3:08:51.300]  we don't want to be with the devil worshipers we surrender we surrender to god because we're
[3:08:51.300 --> 3:08:54.940]  going to surrender to claus wabber bill gates wouldn't you rather surrender to what created
[3:08:54.940 --> 3:08:59.420]  all this and then you find out that god has something bigger and store i mean i never
[3:08:59.420 --> 3:09:03.220]  thought i'd be sitting here when i was a freshman in college watching alex in my dorm room
[3:09:03.220 --> 3:09:07.900]  i never thought i'd be sitting here and and and and help and tell you about this amazing

[3:09:41.700 --> 3:09:47.540]  looks like and how to discover what god wants for you in life yes there's actually a technique
[3:09:47.540 --> 3:09:51.860]  you'll learn in reset wars that will help you connect to god to find your purpose and
[3:09:51.860 --> 3:09:56.860]  as a side note before i hit the rest of these is one of the things that i probably learned
[3:09:56.860 --> 3:10:01.020]  most just from watching you record this and being around you and talking through a lot
[3:10:01.020 --> 3:10:09.700]  of it is your commitment to free will and that god has these big plans for you but it's
[3:10:09.700 --> 3:10:14.780]  a god of free will and unless you step into this bigger vision for your life and unless
[3:10:14.780 --> 3:10:21.100]  you watching this do we can't win no that's it no it's i mean i mean god's and it's not
[3:10:21.100 --> 3:10:25.060]  like god gives you a program to follow at the satanist have an exact program if you submit
[3:10:25.060 --> 3:10:30.460]  to them you're ordered under a i do this exact thing no god goes here's all this you can do
[3:10:30.460 --> 3:10:34.900]  but you must do it in this spectrum this is my will and then you have all this freedom
[3:10:34.900 --> 3:10:39.180]  satanist it's one little path but with god it's just follow the program you do whatever
[3:10:39.180 --> 3:10:44.140]  you want in this area and once you step into that it gets stronger and like it becomes a
[3:10:44.140 --> 3:10:49.180]  joke like why isn't everybody following god i mean it's what it's what doctors and lingo
[3:10:49.180 --> 3:10:52.780]  calls god consciousness he's like this isn't about being jewish or christian because i
[3:10:52.780 --> 3:10:58.420]  love jesus i love christians he gets it it's god i love jews i love a buddhist i love everybody
[3:10:58.420 --> 3:11:03.260]  we love god we must transcend with god consciousness yeah and there's a section earlier which made
[3:11:03.260 --> 3:11:09.540]  me think about you talk about godlessness consciousness and and that's why they're trying
[3:11:09.540 --> 3:11:13.740]  to push us just into an identification they want us dialed into the metaverse and their
[3:11:13.740 --> 3:11:18.700]  limited system and their control no there's a transmission that's from god we just want
[3:11:18.700 --> 3:11:21.340]  you to get but see the priest class doesn't want you to get in that there oh no don't
[3:11:21.340 --> 3:11:25.380]  get that transmission go with us go with us we're like telling you the magician's trick
[3:11:25.380 --> 3:11:30.180]  we're giving you the cheat sheet to the course folks because god gave us free will but god
[3:11:30.180 --> 3:11:36.740]  cheated because he loves us so much and gave us the the manual with jesus christ and revelation
[3:11:36.740 --> 3:11:42.820]  and daniel and ezekiel and and and and and genesis and we've been given the cheat gods
[3:11:42.820 --> 3:11:47.060]  like i love you you've got free will but just like you know when you're taking your kid
[3:11:47.060 --> 3:11:50.860]  to drive the first time or they get their livers license you just go i trust you here's here's
[3:11:50.860 --> 3:11:56.980]  the owners manual and god gave us the owners manual folks god did that and this how we
[3:11:56.980 --> 3:12:01.180]  win when all of us step into that when all of us find our purpose and we find out how
[3:12:01.180 --> 3:12:05.020]  really powerful we are that's what we fight back that's how you make sense of everything
[3:12:05.020 --> 3:12:08.180]  that's happening that's how you find your place in this battle once you get the holy
[3:12:08.180 --> 3:12:13.340]  spirit which you don't get in some dirty church most of them are controlled the devil controls
[3:12:13.340 --> 3:12:16.460]  those he knows you're looking for he wants to block you once you just connect to god
[3:12:16.460 --> 3:12:20.620]  then it all makes sense and then it's like oh my god where was this before yep and that's
[3:12:20.620 --> 3:12:25.460]  how we tell what they say those that serve the devil are lost because they are lost sorry
[3:12:25.460 --> 3:12:29.980]  finish the other sub points it's this is what it's this is why i'm so optimistic right
[3:12:29.980 --> 3:12:34.780]  now and this is why i'm just you know i'm i'm unabashedly telling you you gotta sign
[3:12:34.780 --> 3:12:40.620]  up for this right now so next we've got you're gonna learn alex jones top five techniques
[3:12:40.620 --> 3:12:45.420]  to harness the power of of your imagination and the power of of consciousness i.e. the
[3:12:45.420 --> 3:12:52.100]  absorber effect so that you can make mountains move and they shall you're gonna practice
[3:12:52.100 --> 3:13:00.180]  the number one technique and method to protect yourself your family from the collapse of america
[3:13:00.180 --> 3:13:07.460]  and that's what this entire course is about is getting your mind and soul ready yep because
[3:13:07.460 --> 3:13:11.980]  look all they're doing right now is bombarding us with all this crap to keep us that's the
[3:13:11.980 --> 3:13:16.820]  psychological warfare component and that's why this course is reset words is two courses
[3:13:16.820 --> 3:13:20.580]  in one year you're buying two courses for this you're getting the mind wars and the
[3:13:20.580 --> 3:13:25.660]  spirit wars and that's why they're trying to disconnect us say this because i was literally
[3:13:25.660 --> 3:13:29.420]  having dreams about this and was physically upset about this whenever i'm not doing i'm
[3:13:29.420 --> 3:13:33.300]  supposed to get upset i'll figure it out i'm like i've got to expose the ai takeover i've
[3:13:33.300 --> 3:13:36.380]  got to expose how they're trying to block us off from god i've got to expose we have
[3:13:36.380 --> 3:13:39.900]  the holy spirit i was like how do i do this i'm just like i need to launch a church i
[3:13:39.900 --> 3:13:45.540]  need to create some religious manifesto christian manifesto and then along you come going let's
[3:13:45.540 --> 3:13:49.980]  do a cryptocurrency and go no i want spirit wars and then you're like yeah absolutely
[3:13:49.980 --> 3:13:53.820]  well let's look at and we you it was all meant to happen this was this was meant to happen
[3:13:53.820 --> 3:13:59.580]  check oh yeah no it absolutely was i mean it's it's and that's what i mean you have no idea
[3:13:59.580 --> 3:14:03.980]  what god has planned for you how you're supposed to protect your family where you're supposed
[3:14:03.980 --> 3:14:08.180]  to step into and how you're supposed to because you've got to realize that advanced intelligence
[3:14:08.180 --> 3:14:13.300]  the omnipresence is waiting but it doesn't rape you like satanist it needs you to open
[3:14:13.300 --> 3:14:17.260]  up and that's the free will and that's why we're saying when you join this course and
[3:14:17.260 --> 3:14:21.780]  move through it things start happening in your life because you step into the next dimension
[3:14:21.780 --> 3:14:25.580]  of clear it's not even what i'm saying and it's important when i say it's that it gets
[3:14:25.580 --> 3:14:30.540]  you in the mindset of this yep it's the free will component of of stepping to the next level
[3:14:30.540 --> 3:14:34.220]  and that's how we win that's the shift in consciousness and that's what they're trying

[3:18:00.340 --> 3:18:05.020]  people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico the communists well that's where some of the
[3:18:05.020 --> 3:18:10.220]  best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic and the volcanic soil better
[3:18:10.220 --> 3:18:14.180]  than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy from the little farmers that you know the media
[3:18:14.180 --> 3:18:17.620]  calls common is but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that
[3:18:17.620 --> 3:18:21.340]  it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over
[3:18:21.340 --> 3:18:24.700]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what fourteen years
[3:18:24.700 --> 3:18:28.060]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for
[3:18:28.060 --> 3:18:31.740]  about fifty percent more per pound and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're
[3:18:31.740 --> 3:18:36.140]  going to find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally
[3:18:36.140 --> 3:18:44.180]  um in fact I'm gonna tell you a little story um we had like that you wouldn't believe it

[3:18:58.780 --> 3:19:04.780]  everything I promote is about standing up against the new world order by empowering humanity
[3:19:04.780 --> 3:19:09.980]  well that's why resetwar.com is so important not only is it a game changing course of critical
[3:19:09.980 --> 3:19:15.860]  information to unlock your mind from the matrix but it's something that gets around Clough

[3:21:01.500 --> 3:21:07.340]  and what they're trying to do is overwhelm you so much with everything that's happening
[3:21:07.340 --> 3:21:12.900]  that it traps us in lower dimensions of consciousness it traps us into our minds they're just going
[3:21:12.900 --> 3:21:17.700]  to keep feeding us another another thing another thing another thing that's the psychological
[3:21:17.700 --> 3:21:22.340]  warfare that they're enacting on us right now it's the disorient us it's a trap us
[3:21:22.340 --> 3:21:27.020]  in lower states of consciousness and this is why reset wars is so important because
[3:21:27.020 --> 3:21:31.860]  it's about breaking out of it it's about identifying with your true self and it's about finding
[3:21:31.860 --> 3:21:37.340]  that creativity that strength that motivation in order to not only defeat the great reset

[3:24:48.820 --> 3:24:53.180]  one of the other things just you guys you're all big fans of info wars we all are one
[3:24:53.180 --> 3:24:57.740]  of the other things that's so important about this is because we all know that what's what's
[3:24:57.740 --> 3:25:02.700]  this all about they have to collapse America by shutting down small businesses 70 80% of
[3:25:02.700 --> 3:25:08.260]  people are employed by small businesses we all know all the data on how the amount of
[3:25:08.260 --> 3:25:15.700]  deaths increase per one percentage of unemployment Robert F. Kennedy talks about this a lot in
[3:25:15.700 --> 3:25:23.260]  his new book on Anthony Fauci when he's dissecting the emotional and societal costs of lockdowns
[3:25:23.260 --> 3:25:28.140]  now their goal is to shut down small businesses we all know their goals to shut down Alex
[3:25:28.140 --> 3:25:32.180]  shows we all know that their goals to shut down info wars how do they do that shut down
[3:25:32.180 --> 3:25:36.660]  the supply chains if there's a cyber attack if they shut down the supply chains any worse
[3:25:36.660 --> 3:25:42.580]  than they already are guess what happens we cannot continue to fund info wars so in advance
[3:25:42.580 --> 3:25:48.260]  of any potential of something like that happening what we've done is put together in pivot with
[3:25:48.260 --> 3:25:53.300]  a digital product that's available that is totally bulletproof and that's why this is
[3:25:53.300 --> 3:25:58.700]  so important for my car keys yes I'm on my car keys keep going so that's why this is
[3:25:58.700 --> 3:26:03.380]  so important not to mention if you sign up right now Alex is going to give you his car
[3:26:03.380 --> 3:26:11.060]  for free just joking and so let's get into a little bit and I want to thank you for sticking
[3:26:11.060 --> 3:26:15.100]  with me here my name is Jake and I'm here in honor if you're just joining for reset wars
[3:26:15.100 --> 3:26:18.460]  you probably heard us talking about a lot maybe you've seen it a lot and you're like
[3:26:18.460 --> 3:26:23.980]  oh now I've seen this thing so much and it's 100% money back guarantee I want to encourage
[3:26:23.980 --> 3:26:28.260]  you to join do it for your friends do it for your family protect your family that's what
[3:26:28.260 --> 3:26:33.380]  this is about and this how we win you know simultaneous we didn't even get into it might
[3:26:33.380 --> 3:26:38.380]  be over here yeah Hillary Clinton lost her masterclass yesterday George Bush's is coming
[3:26:38.380 --> 3:26:42.940]  up next we have all the documents here on theirs which is well maybe I'll get into it
[3:26:42.940 --> 3:26:47.940]  in the next segment here so Hillary Clinton's masterclass which is she's going to teach you
[3:26:47.940 --> 3:26:52.620]  the power of resilience even though she spent the last however many years complaining about
[3:26:52.620 --> 3:26:56.940]  why she lost the election none of it's about resilience but let's go through let's compare
[3:26:56.940 --> 3:27:02.540]  Hillary Clinton's masterclass to Alex Joneses number one is meet your instructor number
[3:27:02.540 --> 3:27:08.020]  two is discover your mission which is probably about how you set up a how you set up a nonprofit
[3:27:08.020 --> 3:27:14.060]  foundation so you can take political for an adversary's money the next is Hillary's framework
[3:27:14.060 --> 3:27:19.060]  for hard work well that's got to be good she's probably knows a lot about that number four
[3:27:19.060 --> 3:27:24.100]  organizing a busy life which is probably you need a bunch of servants and they'll do everything
[3:27:24.100 --> 3:27:27.860]  for you all you need to do is accept a bunch of money from foreign governments pay a bunch
[3:27:27.860 --> 3:27:33.100]  of servants then everything's done next is prepare for public speaking oh man guys you're
[3:27:33.100 --> 3:27:39.860]  going to learn how to get a $500,000 20 minute speech from Goldman Sachs next is studying
[3:27:39.860 --> 3:27:47.380]  persuasive speakers look guys it's Russia they did it's Russia next is maximizing your
[3:27:47.380 --> 3:27:52.940]  strengths and learning to pivot she might need to reread her own course next is the
[3:27:52.940 --> 3:27:58.860]  fundamentals of negotiation you don't do what I want I kill you right we all know about
[3:27:58.860 --> 3:28:03.100]  the Clinton bodies that's that's probably what they're going to teach you there next is navigating
[3:28:03.100 --> 3:28:12.620]  and the compromise and trade offs taking criticism seriously not personally next is ambition
[3:28:12.620 --> 3:28:19.380]  and sexism which is probably I didn't win the election because America is sexist it's
[3:28:19.380 --> 3:28:25.180]  okay I'll be resilient anyways and then next is overcoming setbacks so now compare that
[3:28:25.180 --> 3:28:29.820]  and this woman so they're charging a lot of money for these things well this is a Alex's
[3:28:29.820 --> 3:28:35.140]  courses is a drop in the bucket and you can see how powerful this is I'll go back through
[3:28:35.140 --> 3:28:39.420]  everything in a minute we got I went through all the chapters everything that's in there

[3:34:57.300 --> 3:35:00.980]  got to do join reset wars right now go through the course right now record a video on your
[3:35:00.980 --> 3:35:05.940]  phone or whatnot submit your video testimony of what you learned in your message and we're
[3:35:05.940 --> 3:35:12.860]  going to pick a few winners as well so i thought let's get into a little bit of what
[3:35:12.860 --> 3:35:18.100]  and in addition to that twenty five percent off until tomorrow so let's get into a little
[3:35:18.100 --> 3:35:24.340]  bit of my personal favorite parts if you're joining us for the first time i just spent
[3:35:24.340 --> 3:35:29.460]  the last while going through the entire chapters we spent through a hillary's masterclass which
[3:35:29.460 --> 3:35:34.500]  alex didn't even cover so we just went through hillary's masterclass oh oh yeah i forgot we
[3:35:34.500 --> 3:35:40.460]  have we have some extra parts exclusive the would be victory speech she's going to read
[3:35:40.460 --> 3:35:46.140]  her speech that she would have given if she did win the presidency so let's compare this
[3:35:46.140 --> 3:35:51.260]  going back through what you got included in alex's so chapter one is mind wars spirit
[3:35:51.260 --> 3:35:56.500]  wars this is actually two courses in one reset wars is there's two standalone courses mind
[3:35:56.500 --> 3:36:03.820]  wars and spirit wars they're both included so here's why i love this section and why
[3:36:03.820 --> 3:36:08.300]  i love that it's mind wars and spirit wars is because in the course alex likens the
[3:36:08.300 --> 3:36:15.900]  mind to a computer operating system and like it simplifies the whole thing that in the
[3:36:15.900 --> 3:36:20.660]  same way that once you code an operating system of a computer it it works habitually just
[3:36:20.660 --> 3:36:25.300]  like your subconscious mind alex breaks down high psychologist know ninety five percent
[3:36:25.300 --> 3:36:30.780]  of your entire life is sub conscious now the empowering part of that is alex breaks this
[3:36:30.780 --> 3:36:37.420]  whole down into mind wars in that we've been installed with viruses in our operating systems
[3:36:37.420 --> 3:36:46.540]  from the new world order and he breaks down how do you actually erase those viruses from
[3:36:46.540 --> 3:36:51.900]  your operating system and write a new software script now the crazy thing about that is if
[3:36:51.900 --> 3:36:57.260]  everyone has that elon musk tweet handy there's a tweet from elon musk alex and i were talking
[3:36:57.260 --> 3:37:02.340]  on november twenty ninth we did a live show just talking a little bit about some of our
[3:37:02.340 --> 3:37:07.540]  favorite our favorite topics on psychology and mind control and how this whole thing works
[3:37:07.540 --> 3:37:14.380]  and so if you guys got it behind the scenes there elon musk tweet we pulled it up yesterday
[3:37:14.380 --> 3:37:20.140]  so alex and i were on air on the twenty ninth and this as you can see in the bottom there
[3:37:20.140 --> 3:37:25.180]  this tweets from the thirtieth so on the twenty ninth alex and i were breaking down
[3:37:25.180 --> 3:37:31.180]  a couple hundred declassified cia documents one of them was from the pentagon or from
[3:37:31.180 --> 3:37:35.460]  darpa from the head of darpa if you could keep that up for one more moment the head of darpa
[3:37:35.460 --> 3:37:40.940]  was from uh... richard to zero and as you see right there on the second line elon says
[3:37:40.940 --> 3:37:46.540]  the overarching problem is we need better mental firewalls from the information constantly coming
[3:37:46.540 --> 3:37:52.940]  at us that's a very weird word to use if you weren't watching alex shones because richard
[3:37:52.940 --> 3:37:57.620]  to zero in this declassified document that we show the night the day before his tweet
[3:37:57.620 --> 3:38:06.500]  came out was about uh... how the the darpa realized the pentagon's advanced research
[3:38:06.500 --> 3:38:11.460]  and weaponry realized that the human mind doesn't have a firewall like china has their
[3:38:11.460 --> 3:38:16.020]  firewall on their internet and we don't well your mind doesn't have a firewall so they've
[3:38:16.020 --> 3:38:20.340]  learned how to manipulate it with non-lethal energy weapons how to manipulate it with
[3:38:20.340 --> 3:38:27.700]  hypnosis how to manipulate it with what alex calls uh... trauma-based mind control and how to install
[3:38:27.700 --> 3:38:33.660]  viruses into your operating system so elon tweets that the next day and then he ends
[3:38:33.660 --> 3:38:39.700]  it with the most important thing is to find out who wrote your software and i saw that
[3:38:39.700 --> 3:38:44.700]  tweet and i immediately texted alex and i said this is kind of weird because we just
[3:38:44.700 --> 3:38:49.900]  published this yesterday he's literally asking the questions we've said online directly from
[3:38:49.900 --> 3:38:53.660]  the course who wrote the software running in your head are you sure you actually want
[3:38:53.660 --> 3:38:59.060]  it there well this course shows you who wrote the software what it is how to rewrite it
[3:38:59.060 --> 3:39:04.740]  how to put new software in and how to put mental firewalls up so that they can access
[3:39:04.740 --> 3:39:10.140]  it that's what this whole thing is about so it made me think i mean i don't i don't personally
[3:39:10.140 --> 3:39:14.380]  know elon must have no idea but it made me think that he's not only watching the show
[3:39:14.380 --> 3:39:19.860]  but that he's going through the same documents and research that we went through for hundreds
[3:39:19.860 --> 3:39:24.420]  of hours to put reset wars together and why i'm telling you you need to sign up right
[3:39:24.420 --> 3:39:29.540]  now why i'm telling you that this information is so important because that's a question
[3:39:29.540 --> 3:39:34.820]  and it's a question they don't want us to ask is who wrote the software that is your
[3:39:34.820 --> 3:39:39.780]  operating system because we like to think that we did it
[3:39:39.780 --> 3:39:43.620]  oh yeah i did it yeah but 95 percent of our life is subconscious and up in the time we're
[3:39:43.620 --> 3:39:48.140]  six years old the brainwave state that we're in is akin to hypnosis so we're in a hypnotic
[3:39:48.140 --> 3:39:54.620]  state so all of that programming has went directly into your subconscious and so what
[3:39:54.620 --> 3:40:02.180]  happens if we rewrite that operating system what happens in 50,000 people right now join
[3:40:02.180 --> 3:40:10.420]  reset wars move through this course and rewrite their operating system it's over we win and
[3:40:10.420 --> 3:40:13.900]  that's why i'm not giving into the fear anymore that's why i'm not giving into this idea that
[3:40:13.900 --> 3:40:19.700]  we're not going to win what can we do about it oh my gosh we can win but we have to build
[3:40:19.700 --> 3:40:24.980]  mental firewalls and we have to start finding out what our operating system is and rewriting
[3:40:24.980 --> 3:40:30.700]  it and alex breaks down exactly how to do that in the reset wars course even if you
[3:40:30.700 --> 3:40:35.820]  haven't purchased it yet do it for somebody else that do this for your wife do this for
[3:40:35.820 --> 3:40:39.660]  your husband do this for your children do this for your grandchildren because it's the
[3:40:39.660 --> 3:40:44.300]  hundredth monkey effect it's the collective unconsciousness if you do it and you make
[3:40:44.300 --> 3:40:48.420]  that shift because everything's an energy field other people pick that up and that's
[3:40:48.420 --> 3:40:55.700]  how we get that hundredth monkey effect and those drastic shifts in the world so that's
[3:40:55.700 --> 3:41:00.340]  one of my favorite parts as we kind of as i kind of discuss when we wrap up here on
[3:41:00.340 --> 3:41:05.140]  some of my most important or some of my most favorite parts another one that i absolutely
[3:41:05.140 --> 3:41:11.700]  love is beyond the great reset which is chapter two and i said this earlier but as i was alex
[3:41:11.700 --> 3:41:16.180]  asked me to put together this big big huge document here and go back through the whole
[3:41:16.180 --> 3:41:19.660]  course so i was up till two three and putting this whole back thing together and just kind
[3:41:19.660 --> 3:41:24.500]  of put in a summary together for you so you know exactly what's in it no sales no marketing
[3:41:24.500 --> 3:41:30.420]  you know what's in it and you know why you need to buy it and so i said discover what
[3:41:30.420 --> 3:41:36.620]  the great reset is really about hint it has nothing to do with a one world government
[3:41:36.620 --> 3:41:43.740]  it's even more sinister and if you do not learn you cannot protect yourself and your
[3:41:43.740 --> 3:41:51.860]  family this is what claus wab and mark zuckerberg do not want you to know chapter three is about
[3:41:51.860 --> 3:41:57.140]  the nature of reality so alex breaks down how quantum physics works how the observer
[3:41:57.140 --> 3:42:02.260]  effect works how consciousness affects subatomic particles how you can use it to change your
[3:42:02.260 --> 3:42:06.820]  personal reality how he used it to which i didn't know before watching this course be
[3:42:06.820 --> 3:42:10.740]  filmed i didn't know that he started as a as a little kid recording in his closet to
[3:42:10.740 --> 3:42:14.340]  become one of the most powerful people in the world but he breaks down how he was able
[3:42:14.340 --> 3:42:18.180]  to use the observer effect to do that and i know a lot of you listening you want to
[3:42:18.180 --> 3:42:21.820]  be a you want to be a big broadcaster reach and inspire millions of people and defeat

[3:46:04.140 --> 3:46:10.500]  I like the metropolitan life I like everything that comes with this but see I have the survival

[3:46:16.500 --> 3:46:21.620]  areas because unless we change course soon it's all crashing down is it time to just

[3:50:34.740 --> 3:50:42.300]  where alex really dives deeply into his connection to god there's a series of actual prayers
[3:50:42.300 --> 3:50:48.220]  that you can utilize that are incredibly powerful prayers on everything from forgiveness on
[3:50:48.220 --> 3:50:55.780]  clarity in life on god sending you sign very powerful stuff that's included in here and
[3:50:55.780 --> 3:51:00.380]  so there were some people asking well what is this all about and so today I wanted to
[3:51:00.380 --> 3:51:07.140]  take that time to as if you've been listening to move through all of this I covered in depth
[3:51:07.140 --> 3:51:13.100]  now compare that to our good old friend hillary clinton's course hillary clinton reads her
[3:51:13.100 --> 3:51:19.980]  would be 2016 presidential victory speech in her new mastery class on resilience well
[3:51:19.980 --> 3:51:24.900]  if america wasn't so sexist I would have won and if it wasn't so sexist here would have
[3:51:24.900 --> 3:51:29.580]  been my speech that I didn't write anyways and you know I paid my speech writers your
[3:51:29.580 --> 3:51:35.140]  golden sacks pay my speech writers $500,000 and I had them read it then you're going
[3:51:35.140 --> 3:51:40.940]  to learn about sexism after you learn about sexism then you're going to learn about the
[3:51:40.940 --> 3:51:47.340]  power of manipulation after you learn that then what you're going to learn is negotiation
[3:51:47.340 --> 3:51:52.180]  and we're going to teach you how to basically get people to do what they want or add them
[3:51:52.180 --> 3:51:58.060]  to the clinton body bag and it just basically goes on and on and on and on it what's hilarious
[3:51:58.060 --> 3:52:03.140]  is they announced this pretty shortly after you know obviously Alex shone's lives in
[3:52:03.140 --> 3:52:07.620]  hillary clinton's head and they announced this pretty shortly after Alex started saying
[3:52:07.620 --> 3:52:11.620]  hey I've got this online course about this online training coming it's almost like they're
[3:52:11.620 --> 3:52:16.380]  just trying to fill everyone with a bunch of crap to distract from everything that's
[3:52:16.380 --> 3:52:21.380]  really happening so you can meet your trainer you can meet your instructor it's hillary
[3:52:21.380 --> 3:52:27.460]  she's woman of the year all these great things now compare that to imagine if you got to
[3:52:27.460 --> 3:52:32.460]  sit down with Alex for 24 hours you have to ask him any questions understand how Alex
[3:52:32.460 --> 3:52:37.260]  ticks understand everything that's happening in the world and break it down into cohesive
[3:52:37.260 --> 3:52:45.020]  and organized fashion that's what reset wars is all about so that's reset wars dot com
[3:52:45.020 --> 3:52:48.460]  and I want to take a minute here and I just want to talk a little bit about some optimistic
[3:52:48.460 --> 3:52:52.340]  stuff as we're coming to the end of the day here you know there's a lot of crap happening
[3:52:52.340 --> 3:52:56.940]  in the world and the whole goal is to overwhelm us with this crap to move us into lower dimensions
[3:52:56.940 --> 3:53:03.060]  of consciousness because the way that they win is to disconnect us to one inspiration
[3:53:03.060 --> 3:53:08.780]  what is inspiration Alex breaks down in the course inspiration is in spirit it's when
[3:53:08.780 --> 3:53:12.940]  you're in alignment with God it's when you're in alignment with the Holy Spirit it's when
[3:53:12.940 --> 3:53:17.060]  you're connected to your higher self so their whole goal is to get us uninspired to disconnect
[3:53:17.060 --> 3:53:21.940]  us from spirit to trap us into lower dimensions of fear to keep our nervous system constantly
[3:53:21.940 --> 3:53:27.100]  in a fight or flight where it's like the nervous system is just always in a state of flux that's
[3:53:27.100 --> 3:53:31.860]  what they need to have happen and that's why vice news attacked reset wars before it even
[3:53:31.860 --> 3:53:37.660]  came out which shows you how afraid that they were of it in addition to that we had one
[3:53:37.660 --> 3:53:42.700]  of our software systems get nixed right before this came out without getting into too much
[3:53:42.700 --> 3:53:47.540]  more detail so they knew this was coming out and then the other thing in addition I didn't
[3:53:47.540 --> 3:53:53.180]  even talk about is we do not know how long reset wars will be available when you buy
[3:53:53.180 --> 3:53:58.020]  it you get access to it if they shut the sites down they shut down info wars which obviously
[3:53:58.020 --> 3:54:01.700]  they're trying to do you're going to have this no matter what you're going to rest assured
[3:54:01.700 --> 3:54:05.580]  knowing that you have it now let's talk a little bit about some things to be excited
[3:54:05.580 --> 3:54:10.540]  about let's talk about a little bit of some things to be grateful for number one is people
[3:54:10.540 --> 3:54:15.900]  are waking up in mass the whole way the media system and the algorithms are designed is to
[3:54:15.900 --> 3:54:20.060]  make us feel alone it's important to recognize that you are not alone there are a lot of
[3:54:20.060 --> 3:54:25.340]  people waking up every single solitary day number two is I'm thankful to I'm thankful
[3:54:25.340 --> 3:54:28.540]  to God and I'm thankful that we all have a bigger plan in our life than we ever could
[3:54:28.540 --> 3:54:32.500]  imagine and when we find the courage when we find the strength when we find the motivation
[3:54:32.500 --> 3:54:36.860]  to pursue it we have literally no idea where a life will lead I mean Alex had no idea who's
[3:54:36.860 --> 3:54:41.220]  going to be some kid recording in a closet to become this guy you know reaching millions
[3:54:41.220 --> 3:54:45.580]  of people every single day and targeted by you know all these entities and agencies all
[3:54:45.580 --> 3:54:49.580]  around the world because I want to shut them down you don't know you have no idea you can't
[3:54:49.580 --> 3:54:55.380]  even imagine what you're really capable of when you step into this place and that's why
[3:54:55.380 --> 3:55:00.660]  Alex put together reset wars because Alex is Alex is fighting the fight he's tired he's
[3:55:00.660 --> 3:55:04.540]  got a lot going on he's getting attacked in every which direction he said we need to create
[3:55:04.540 --> 3:55:10.260]  more leaders and that's what this is about and so if you if you feel a connection to
[3:55:10.260 --> 3:55:15.700]  Alex if you feel connection to info wars if you're thankful for what they're doing what
[3:55:15.700 --> 3:55:19.500]  they're putting out you're watching it every day one of the best ways you could return
[3:55:19.500 --> 3:55:23.580]  because people say I just want to thank you Alex I just want to thank you one of the best
[3:55:23.580 --> 3:55:28.820]  ways you could thank Alex is to not only just buy reset wars and support that financially
[3:55:28.820 --> 3:55:33.580]  but is to move through the course and move through the exercises submit your video testimony
[3:55:33.580 --> 3:55:38.020]  and apply this into your life that's how he said he told me that he could rest assured
[3:55:38.020 --> 3:55:43.020]  knowing that his work is going to the next level because he realizes that if we're really
[3:55:43.020 --> 3:55:48.300]  going to win this thing we have to have these shifts in consciousness we have to have these
[3:55:48.300 --> 3:55:56.300]  transformations in the course Alex talks about Transformation Trans meaning beyond and form
[3:55:56.300 --> 3:56:02.500]  meaning the physical world and Asian is the process of so transformation and a lot of
[3:56:02.500 --> 3:56:05.580]  times when we look at what's happening in the world we think we're stuck in this little
[3:56:05.580 --> 3:56:10.540]  physical realm called the matrix well taking the red pill is realizing that reality is
[3:56:10.540 --> 3:56:15.180]  malleable reality is made up of a bunch of energy and subatomic particles and energies
[3:56:15.180 --> 3:56:20.140]  never created or destroyed and due to the power of consciousness due to our own free will
[3:56:20.140 --> 3:56:25.660]  we can start to change reality we can start to recreate reality which is another thing
[3:56:25.660 --> 3:56:32.220]  to be excited about it I mean ask ourselves why did Max Plank which Alex talks a lot
[3:56:32.220 --> 3:56:39.060]  about Max Plank in his course how did Max Plank win the Nobel Prize in 1913 for quantum
[3:56:39.060 --> 3:56:43.300]  physics breaking all of this down but it's not taught in schools it's because they need
[3:56:43.300 --> 3:56:47.900]  to hide this information about the power of consciousness trap us into our physical selves
[3:56:47.900 --> 3:56:54.140]  get us to believe we're just physical bodies because if they do then they can officially
[3:56:54.140 --> 3:56:58.300]  run a tyranny system but if people wake up to the power that they have they're inspired
[3:56:58.300 --> 3:57:03.420]  by some great purpose as Patanjali says some extraordinary bonds all their barriers break
[3:57:03.420 --> 3:57:07.180]  their limitations they find herself a more powerful person they ever imagine this is
[3:57:07.180 --> 3:57:10.620]  why they're trying to stop it this is what school should be teaching this is what everything
[3:57:10.620 --> 3:57:14.700]  should be teaching and this is what you're going to learn in the reset wars course show
