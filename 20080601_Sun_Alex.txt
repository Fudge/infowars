[00:00.000 --> 00:03.560]  Democratic primaries is being held today in Puerto Rico.
[00:03.560 --> 00:05.080]  Hillary Rodham Clinton is favored,
[00:05.080 --> 00:08.200]  but Obama still has a commanding lead in delegates
[00:08.200 --> 00:10.640]  and could clinch the nomination this week.
[00:10.640 --> 00:12.840]  Clinton says improving healthcare would become
[00:12.840 --> 00:15.360]  a top priority if she became president.
[00:15.360 --> 00:19.160]  I am very committed to making healthcare
[00:19.160 --> 00:24.160]  of high quality, of equality, and of affordability.
[00:24.160 --> 00:25.760]  And Clinton's supporters are threatening
[00:25.760 --> 00:27.160]  to stretch the delegate fight
[00:27.160 --> 00:29.400]  into the Democratic Convention in August.
[00:29.400 --> 00:31.320]  They're unhappy with yesterday's decision
[00:31.320 --> 00:33.080]  from the party's rules committee
[00:33.080 --> 00:36.400]  fearing she was denied four delegates she deserved.
[00:36.400 --> 00:39.680]  Obama thinks both Clintons will accept Saturday's decision
[00:39.680 --> 00:42.520]  on seating half the delegates in Michigan and Florida.
[00:42.520 --> 00:44.320]  I think they deeply believe that
[00:44.320 --> 00:46.560]  Democrats need to win in November.
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.960]  And so I trust that they're gonna do the right thing.
[00:48.960 --> 00:51.560]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:52.600 --> 00:56.120]  Suriasis, the itching, flaking, and irritation is painful,
[00:56.120 --> 00:58.880]  but the emotional suffering can be even more devastating.
[00:58.880 --> 01:00.040]  My body was so sore.
[01:00.040 --> 01:01.280]  My mind was so worn out.
[01:01.280 --> 01:02.480]  I could not sleep at night.
[01:02.480 --> 01:03.600]  I felt self-conscious.
[01:03.600 --> 01:05.080]  Nobody knows what that flaking is.
[01:05.080 --> 01:07.600]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[01:07.600 --> 01:09.160]  A lot of people know when I have this embarrassing.
[01:09.160 --> 01:10.480]  Of course I felt self-conscious.
[01:10.480 --> 01:11.920]  Not very attractive to look at.
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.800]  The solution is new and improves.
[01:13.800 --> 01:17.600]  Kin Zink Advanced, the number one OTC treatment for suriasis.
[01:17.600 --> 01:19.800]  Kin Zink turned out to be the perfect answer.
[01:19.800 --> 01:22.360]  Kin Zink has changed my life the third day.
[01:22.360 --> 01:24.440]  I saw that my suriasis was disappearing.
[01:24.440 --> 01:26.600]  One week I noticed that the rashes on my arms
[01:26.600 --> 01:27.440]  were going away.
[01:27.440 --> 01:29.320]  The elbows are completely cleared up.
[01:29.320 --> 01:30.320]  You have to try it.
[01:30.320 --> 01:32.240]  Kin Zink will make your suriasis go away.
[01:32.240 --> 01:34.320]  I think we're a Kin Zink family for life.

[01:36.800 --> 01:40.520]  of Kin Zink with hydronize 1-800-626-5198.

[01:48.840 --> 01:51.040]  1-800-626-5198.
[01:52.880 --> 01:54.840]  Myanmar's military rulers are denying
[01:54.840 --> 01:58.200]  that they were slow to help victims of last month's cyclone.
[01:58.200 --> 02:00.320]  One of the generals speaking in Singapore
[02:00.320 --> 02:02.680]  says they broadcast warnings about the storm
[02:02.680 --> 02:04.920]  and moved quickly to provide relief.
[02:04.920 --> 02:07.360]  Specialists could be needed from outside the country.
[02:07.360 --> 02:08.600]  And here's Michael Casey.
[02:08.600 --> 02:10.640]  In terms of running a relief operation
[02:10.640 --> 02:13.480]  and running technical equipment like a water purification
[02:13.480 --> 02:15.880]  system requires real expertise.
[02:15.880 --> 02:18.680]  And when you start moving into the rehabilitation stage,
[02:18.680 --> 02:19.680]  you need engineers.
[02:19.680 --> 02:20.520]  You need architects.
[02:20.520 --> 02:22.440]  You need people that can rebuild communities.
[02:22.440 --> 02:24.680]  In Australia has quit combat operations
[02:24.680 --> 02:25.720]  in Iraq.
[02:25.720 --> 02:29.040]  That was one of the promises of Australia's new prime minister
[02:29.040 --> 02:31.000]  who says his country's deployment has made it
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.120]  more of a target for terrorists.
[02:33.120 --> 02:36.120]  Some troops will remain to provide security.
[02:36.120 --> 02:37.920]  And hundreds of people in black T-shirts
[02:37.920 --> 02:40.960]  have marched in Hong Kong to mark the 19th anniversary
[02:40.960 --> 02:42.880]  of China's bloody crackdown.
[02:42.880 --> 02:44.880]  It was a silent march from a Hong Kong
[02:44.880 --> 02:47.080]  park to government headquarters.
[02:47.080 --> 02:52.560]  For more news and analysis, log on to irnnews.com.
[02:52.560 --> 02:54.600]  When peanuts or cattle roasted, they're extra crunchy.
[02:54.600 --> 02:56.320]  Like planters, cattle roasted peanuts.
[02:56.320 --> 02:58.560]  Here to explain, cattle expert Dagmar the witch.
[02:58.560 --> 03:01.520]  To make extra crunchy peanuts, you must first
[03:01.520 --> 03:03.000]  prepare your kettle.
[03:03.000 --> 03:03.760]  That sounds reasonable.
[03:03.760 --> 03:06.640]  With the fat rendered from boiling children.
[03:06.640 --> 03:08.120]  Ow!
[03:08.120 --> 03:11.120]  Dagmar, we just want to make the peanuts extra crunchy.
[03:11.120 --> 03:11.620]  Nothing.
[03:11.620 --> 03:14.160]  Into the kettle, you crunchy, crunchy bruh.
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.960]  No children were harmed in the making of the planters,
[03:15.960 --> 03:17.600]  extra crunchy, cattle roasted peanuts.
[03:17.600 --> 03:20.000]  Drop that kid, Dagmar.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.120]  Planters, instinctively good.
[03:23.120 --> 03:28.120]  Your wildest dreams by the Moody Blues
[03:28.120 --> 03:30.880]  played as wake-up music for the shuttle crew.
[03:30.880 --> 03:32.120]  Good morning, Discovery.
[03:32.120 --> 03:34.240]  A special good morning to you today, Ken.
[03:34.240 --> 03:37.120]  Welcome to your first full day in space.
[03:40.120 --> 03:41.320]  Well, thanks, Shannon.
[03:41.320 --> 03:44.120]  And I know where that one came from.
[03:44.120 --> 03:46.120]  It's been a long time and some great memories
[03:46.120 --> 03:47.120]  since that song.
[03:47.120 --> 03:47.880]  Thanks, Bob.
[03:47.880 --> 03:49.760]  Space Shuttle Discovery is cruising
[03:49.760 --> 03:52.120]  toward the International Space Station.
[03:52.120 --> 03:54.040]  It's scheduled to dock tomorrow.
[03:54.040 --> 03:56.840]  The shuttle is carrying up a huge new addition
[03:56.840 --> 04:00.880]  for the orbiting outpost, a Japanese science lab.
[04:00.880 --> 04:04.440]  Israel has freed a convicted spy and sent him to Lebanon.
[04:04.440 --> 04:05.400]  Here's Mark Levy.
[04:05.400 --> 04:08.680]  Israel deported 11-ease Jews who served six years in prison
[04:08.680 --> 04:09.960]  on spying charges.
[04:09.960 --> 04:12.720]  And in a surprise move, the 11-ease Hezbollah guerrillas
[04:12.720 --> 04:15.240]  returned a box with what they said were body parts
[04:15.240 --> 04:18.240]  of Israeli soldiers killed in a war two years ago.
[04:18.240 --> 04:20.480]  Hezbollah was holding two Israeli soldiers captured
[04:20.480 --> 04:21.640]  at the start of the war.
[04:21.640 --> 04:24.240]  And Israel has seven more 11-ease in its prisons.
[04:24.240 --> 04:25.840]  The two sides are bitter enemies.
[04:25.840 --> 04:27.400]  Nothing is done for free.
[04:27.400 --> 04:29.880]  That's sparking predictions of a larger prisoner swap
[04:29.880 --> 04:31.280]  in the near future.
[04:31.280 --> 04:32.480]  Mark Levy, Tel Aviv.
[04:32.480 --> 04:34.120]  And authorities in South Texas are
[04:34.120 --> 04:36.840]  looking for a man who shot free people last night
[04:36.840 --> 04:39.880]  after being thrown out of an illegal cock fight.
[04:39.880 --> 04:43.120]  Several others attending the event had guns and shot back.
[04:43.120 --> 04:45.840]  Police didn't find out about it until the wounded began
[04:45.840 --> 04:47.680]  arriving at the hospital.
[04:47.680 --> 04:50.440]  I'm Jody Jordan, and that's news from the Information
[04:50.440 --> 04:53.040]  Radio Network.
[04:53.040 --> 04:54.720]  Can a magnet relieve pain?
[04:54.720 --> 04:56.560]  Can a magnet kill bacteria?
[04:56.560 --> 04:58.920]  Can a magnet address your health concerns?
[04:58.920 --> 05:01.120]  Lion Legacy has the answer.
[05:01.120 --> 05:03.520]  Lion Legacy has been around for 17 years
[05:03.520 --> 05:05.800]  and has coined the phrase, properly designed,
[05:05.800 --> 05:07.080]  therapeutic magnets.
[05:07.080 --> 05:09.120]  Lion Legacy offers therapeutic magnets
[05:09.120 --> 05:10.880]  that are used by people all around the world
[05:10.880 --> 05:12.080]  with great success.
[05:12.080 --> 05:13.880]  These are not everyday magnets that
[05:13.880 --> 05:16.360]  are designed to hold a report card on the refrigerator.
[05:16.360 --> 05:19.120]  No, these magnets are nothing like you've ever seen.
[05:19.120 --> 05:20.360]  What makes them different?
[05:20.360 --> 05:21.880]  What makes them unique?
[05:21.880 --> 05:24.600]  Well, the poles are separated to deliver the healing energy
[05:24.600 --> 05:27.200]  of the North Pole and are large enough to deliver
[05:27.200 --> 05:28.640]  an effective force field.
[05:28.640 --> 05:30.760]  They're so durable that if you happen to drop them,
[05:30.760 --> 05:31.960]  they won't lose their strength.
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.200]  There is nothing more natural and safe than magnetic therapy.
[05:35.200 --> 05:37.360]  Lion Legacy has developed a line of supplements
[05:37.360 --> 05:40.320]  that improve the effectiveness of the magnets even more.

[06:29.600 --> 06:36.280]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[06:36.280 --> 06:39.040]  Welcome, my friends, stations.
[06:39.040 --> 06:41.160]  Taking this transmission across the country.
[06:41.160 --> 06:43.400]  Folks listening on satellite global shortwave,
[06:43.400 --> 06:45.240]  the internet or out of the mothership
[06:45.240 --> 06:46.600]  where I come to you from.
[06:46.600 --> 06:48.840]  This radio 590 KELBJ in Austin, Texas,
[06:48.840 --> 06:53.440]  deep in the heart of geographic Texas.
[06:53.440 --> 06:56.800]  It is June 1, 2008.
[06:56.800 --> 06:59.440]  I've never really asked for donations on my radio show
[06:59.440 --> 07:02.920]  for my news websites and films, though every other type
[07:02.920 --> 07:06.040]  organization seems to do it.
[07:06.040 --> 07:09.800]  The same folks that bought up the Ron Paul Money Bomb who
[07:09.800 --> 07:15.000]  raised $6.7 million in one day breaking all campaign finance
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.040]  records and it was small donations,
[07:17.040 --> 07:20.280]  they decided a few weeks ago to have a money bomb for me.
[07:20.280 --> 07:22.120]  And I kind of got behind it about a week ago
[07:22.120 --> 07:24.800]  and it did raise about $250,000.
[07:24.800 --> 07:29.920]  I say about because we turned the graph off at Pacific time
[07:29.920 --> 07:31.040]  midnight last night.
[07:31.040 --> 07:32.280]  And I know more came in.
[07:32.280 --> 07:34.400]  It's probably more than $250,000.
[07:34.400 --> 07:38.920]  But as of last night, it was about $210,000.
[07:38.920 --> 07:42.240]  And 100% of that money, and I should say 110%,
[07:42.240 --> 07:44.920]  because I'm going to put a bunch of my own meager savings
[07:44.920 --> 07:50.480]  into it, is going to go into developing a dish network,
[07:50.480 --> 07:53.800]  TV show, and then if I can do that in the next year,
[07:53.800 --> 07:56.760]  launching a channel, something like Democracy Now,
[07:56.760 --> 07:59.240]  but that is truly conservative.
[07:59.240 --> 08:01.160]  Not founded by the big foundations,
[08:01.160 --> 08:04.720]  fake establishment liberal like Democracy Now,
[08:04.720 --> 08:06.440]  and not something like Fox News.
[08:06.440 --> 08:08.080]  Of course, it'll be low budget, but that's
[08:08.080 --> 08:09.160]  how Democracy Now started.
[08:09.160 --> 08:11.320]  And it'll be a lot of work.
[08:11.320 --> 08:15.520]  But I announced I was going to do something like this,
[08:15.520 --> 08:18.320]  and then the Money Mom folks had the idea to try to support me.
[08:18.320 --> 08:20.600]  And so now I've got to take that money out of our main business
[08:20.600 --> 08:22.000]  account and stick it in another account,
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.040]  because I'm going to spend 100% of that
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.640]  on fighting the New World Order.
[08:26.640 --> 08:29.760]  I'm not even going to buy the office Chinese food.
[08:29.760 --> 08:32.560]  I mean, that money will all go to fighting the New World Order.
[08:32.560 --> 08:33.760]  So very exciting.
[08:33.760 --> 08:34.880]  From the bottom of my heart, I want
[08:34.880 --> 08:39.960]  to thank all of the listeners out there who did go in and donate.
[08:39.960 --> 08:42.600]  The average donation size was about $18.
[08:42.600 --> 08:44.320]  I did the average yesterday in the middle of the day.
[08:44.320 --> 08:46.800]  It was about $18.
[08:46.800 --> 08:48.920]  And thousands of people donated.
[08:48.920 --> 08:51.640]  And I really appreciate it.
[08:51.640 --> 08:55.440]  And that will go a long way towards doing what we need to do.
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.240]  That said, we are here to cover the news and information.
[08:59.240 --> 09:01.880]  I thought in this first segment, I would first tell you,
[09:01.880 --> 09:03.560]  I'm going to take a lot of calls today.
[09:03.560 --> 09:09.600]  Toll free 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525.
[09:09.600 --> 09:11.120]  You're listening on stations across the country
[09:11.120 --> 09:14.680]  from San Diego to Kansas City to Niagara Falls to Tampa, Florida.
[09:14.680 --> 09:19.120]  But if you're listening in Texas, you can call 830-590.
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.000]  If you're listening in central Texas, 830-590
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.000]  is the local number.
[09:27.040 --> 09:30.400]  I thought I would try to be a little bit calmer today.
[09:30.400 --> 09:32.080]  You know, that usually doesn't end up working.
[09:32.080 --> 09:34.480]  So I could talk about some about my philosophy.
[09:34.480 --> 09:36.560]  Because people are always asking me, what's your view on this?
[09:36.560 --> 09:38.320]  What's your view on that?
[09:38.320 --> 09:41.360]  What are you, a liberal, a conservative, and all these terms?
[09:41.360 --> 09:43.840]  Or, well, you're against the global carbon tax,
[09:43.840 --> 09:48.200]  the, quote, global warming tax, what you're not for the environment.
[09:48.200 --> 09:51.080]  I mean, I want to explain just a few basics.
[09:51.080 --> 09:55.840]  Or, Alex, do you hate Mexicans?
[09:55.840 --> 09:58.800]  You know, I get emails like that.
[09:58.800 --> 10:02.480]  So I want to try to answer a few of those more popularly asked
[10:02.480 --> 10:04.880]  questions, and then I'm going to get into all the news
[10:04.880 --> 10:07.120]  that I have here in front of me.
[10:07.120 --> 10:08.760]  And here's one of them.
[10:08.760 --> 10:12.040]  Worst vaccine bill ever seeks compulsory shots
[10:12.040 --> 10:13.600]  for all children, four shots.
[10:13.600 --> 10:16.080]  Now, a lot of mainline listeners are going, what do you mean?
[10:16.080 --> 10:18.240]  It's already the law to take shots.
[10:18.240 --> 10:20.240]  No, it's not the law.
[10:20.240 --> 10:23.120]  And the mere fact of even if you're four inoculations
[10:23.120 --> 10:26.120]  and think they're all safe, why is the media and the government
[10:26.120 --> 10:28.960]  lying to you in concert?
[10:28.960 --> 10:31.600]  I mean, that's a serious crime.
[10:31.600 --> 10:32.920]  I mean, it is a crime.
[10:32.920 --> 10:34.080]  And so I want to go over that.
[10:34.080 --> 10:37.320]  But this new bill, very, very serious.
[10:37.320 --> 10:42.600]  Also, another report that I have here in front of me
[10:42.600 --> 10:45.320]  is out of Indianapolis, Indiana.
[10:45.320 --> 10:49.680]  I'm tempted to play part of this newscast
[10:49.680 --> 10:52.640]  because it's even hard for me to believe.
[10:52.640 --> 10:54.720]  And when you watch the newscast, I mean,
[10:54.720 --> 10:58.600]  if I just read the text of the WISH TV, it's hard to believe.
[10:58.600 --> 11:00.000]  I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[11:00.000 --> 11:01.560]  I'm going to play part of it, document.
[11:01.560 --> 11:03.760]  This is real.
[11:03.760 --> 11:05.640]  Now, I say it's hard for me to believe.
[11:05.640 --> 11:10.000]  You would have heard this from me many times on this show.
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  But if you go to the dentist any time in the nine months
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.960]  that you're having a baby and you tell the hospital,
[11:18.960 --> 11:21.800]  and well, now a lot of the times they just get your medical records,
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.360]  that you've taken any painkillers, CPS will take your child.
[11:25.360 --> 11:27.840]  Doesn't matter if doctors prescribe it.
[11:27.840 --> 11:30.920]  Doesn't matter if it's OK to give it to a pregnant woman.
[11:30.920 --> 11:32.360]  You see, they have quotas.
[11:32.360 --> 11:35.240]  And they've got to kidnap kids.
[11:35.240 --> 11:37.240]  And the feds pay for this.
[11:37.240 --> 11:43.320]  And so we're going to cover that.
[11:43.320 --> 11:45.720]  Coming up, also, the Marines, starting in three days,
[11:45.720 --> 11:47.400]  are going to be in Indianapolis, Indiana,
[11:47.400 --> 11:49.440]  speaking of the same place, training people
[11:49.440 --> 11:53.640]  for martial law takeover, and actually running checkpoints
[11:53.640 --> 11:55.440]  and stopping pedestrians.
[11:55.440 --> 11:58.000]  Now, I videotaped this eight years ago, nine years ago,
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.000]  six years ago.
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.760]  Put it in police state 2000, police state do the takeover,
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.520]  police state three total enslavement, 9-11 the road to tyranny.
[12:05.520 --> 12:12.680]  Last film I did covering this was in 2003.
[12:12.680 --> 12:15.440]  Kind of what I was known for was covering this.
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.600]  And if I wasn't going to Virginia to DC and then
[12:19.600 --> 12:23.160]  right outside DC and Chantilly, right on the border there,
[12:23.160 --> 12:25.960]  very wealthy area, to cover the Bilderberg group,
[12:25.960 --> 12:27.720]  the true government of the planet,
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.200]  meeting Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, I haven't
[12:32.200 --> 12:34.120]  decided I'm going to have Jason Bermas, great talk show
[12:34.120 --> 12:36.000]  host, who sits in there in my weekday show,
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.800]  come in and do next Sunday here with a Sunday show,
[12:38.800 --> 12:40.960]  or whether I should just want to rebroadcast with stuff
[12:40.960 --> 12:43.320]  you haven't heard, like my full second Willie Nelson
[12:43.320 --> 12:46.960]  interview, or a bunch of other big interviews
[12:46.960 --> 12:50.440]  we've had next week.
[12:50.440 --> 12:51.880]  There will be a guest host in here,
[12:51.880 --> 12:57.760]  or you will hear every broadcast next week.
[12:57.760 --> 12:58.920]  But because I'm going to be there.
[12:58.920 --> 13:02.000]  But if I wasn't there, I'd be in Indianapolis.
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.440]  I want to talk about this evolution of training us
[13:04.440 --> 13:07.360]  to accept occupying military force.
[13:07.360 --> 13:09.760]  They're training the police, the public, everybody.
[13:09.760 --> 13:11.320]  And they also bribe the local government.
[13:11.320 --> 13:14.520]  We have documented this, I've interviewed two police chiefs,
[13:14.520 --> 13:16.840]  an emergency manager, and others.
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.200]  Police chief of San Antonio said they tried to bribe him.
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.520]  That's how they do it.
[13:24.520 --> 13:32.600]  $60-plus billion has been flown in on C-130s into Iraq.
[13:32.600 --> 13:36.360]  And the private skid on average, $30,000 in cash.
[13:36.360 --> 13:37.240]  They're told it's illegal.
[13:37.240 --> 13:38.160]  Tell no one.
[13:38.160 --> 13:40.760]  That's to compromise them.
[13:40.760 --> 13:43.560]  A mid-level sergeant gets about $100,000,
[13:43.560 --> 13:46.640]  a colonel, close to $1 million, or more.
[13:46.640 --> 13:50.160]  Brigadier generals, it's hundreds of millions.
[13:50.160 --> 13:53.760]  And again, that's to bring them into black ops,
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.880]  get them into criminality, bring them back
[13:55.880 --> 13:58.200]  as a criminal force to rule over us.
[13:58.200 --> 14:00.760]  And it's actually mainstream news now.
[14:00.760 --> 14:02.520]  But I wanted to not just get into how they're
[14:02.520 --> 14:03.760]  training to confiscate your guns.
[14:03.760 --> 14:05.960]  I mean, I videotaped that and had the troops on video.
[14:05.960 --> 14:07.360]  Training to take your guns, America.
[14:11.000 --> 14:11.680]  And it's the same thing.
[14:11.680 --> 14:12.800]  Do I hate our military?
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.760]  Am I some peacenik person who hates guns and uniforms?
[14:16.760 --> 14:17.260]  No.
[14:17.260 --> 14:22.700]  But I mean, that's, it'd be like if I was a German in 1940
[14:22.700 --> 14:24.420]  saying, do you hate the German military?
[14:24.420 --> 14:28.420]  No, I hate what Hitler is doing with it.
[14:28.420 --> 14:30.100]  Kind of like, do I hate the Russian military?
[14:30.100 --> 14:32.980]  If I lived in Russia in 1918, I'd say no,
[14:32.980 --> 14:36.060]  I'm not against Russia's military.
[14:36.060 --> 14:43.780]  I am against what Vladimir Lenin is doing with them.
[14:43.780 --> 14:44.540]  See, it's real simple.
[14:44.540 --> 14:47.740]  Just like I'm not against the Mexican people.
[14:47.740 --> 14:51.420]  They're hardworking, wonderful, smart, neat people.
[14:51.420 --> 14:53.740]  But the Ford Foundation and other big money
[14:53.740 --> 14:57.700]  groups have spent hundreds of billions in the last 50 years
[14:57.700 --> 15:02.900]  for comic books, the textbooks in Mexico telling them
[15:02.900 --> 15:05.540]  the US belongs to Mexico, the US is evil.
[15:05.540 --> 15:07.900]  Our government pays for that.
[15:07.900 --> 15:09.900]  Just like it's admitted, Washington Post,
[15:09.900 --> 15:12.780]  that our government for 50 years radicalized the Muslims,
[15:12.780 --> 15:15.380]  created the Wahhabist Al-Qaeda sects
[15:15.380 --> 15:17.700]  to overthrow secular governments and destabilize
[15:17.700 --> 15:18.860]  the Middle East.
[15:18.860 --> 15:20.980]  They're little time bombs the globalists created
[15:20.980 --> 15:23.380]  and put over there.
[15:23.380 --> 15:26.300]  I'm against how the illegal aliens are driving down the wages
[15:26.300 --> 15:28.780]  and have radio stations named the race,
[15:28.780 --> 15:30.780]  talking about how they're going to take over and kick
[15:30.780 --> 15:31.980]  the gringos out.
[15:31.980 --> 15:34.500]  See, I protested the Ku Klux Klan.
[15:34.500 --> 15:38.100]  So I'm going to protest the LaRica Conquistus,
[15:38.100 --> 15:39.900]  because it's just Hispanic Klan.
[15:39.900 --> 15:41.020]  Am I against white people?
[15:41.020 --> 15:43.540]  No, I'm against the Klan.
[15:43.540 --> 15:44.580]  Am I against Mexicans?
[15:44.580 --> 15:46.580]  No, I'm against Mexican Klan.
[15:46.580 --> 15:47.380]  We'll be right back.
[15:47.380 --> 15:47.940]  Stay with us.
[15:53.020 --> 15:57.260]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[15:57.260 --> 16:00.140]  In the near future, Earth is dominated
[16:00.140 --> 16:02.180]  by a powerful world government.
[16:02.180 --> 16:04.980]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[16:04.980 --> 16:07.820]  Could their objective be world domination?
[16:07.820 --> 16:10.900]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[16:10.900 --> 16:13.860]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[16:13.860 --> 16:17.740]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[16:17.740 --> 16:18.340]  is at hand.
[16:21.340 --> 16:23.980]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan
[16:23.980 --> 16:26.780]  for world government is blown wide open.
[16:26.780 --> 16:29.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world
[16:29.500 --> 16:30.620]  order agenda.
[16:30.620 --> 16:33.180]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[16:33.180 --> 16:34.340]  Most people have no idea.
[16:34.340 --> 16:35.140]  They're not after money.
[16:35.140 --> 16:36.420]  They have all the money they need.
[16:36.420 --> 16:37.380]  They're after power.
[16:37.380 --> 16:38.460]  That's their after easy.

[16:43.260 --> 16:47.180]  or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[16:47.180 --> 16:50.020]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[16:50.020 --> 16:51.700]  You have been warned.
[16:51.700 --> 16:54.460]  Hi, Ted Enners from Midas, May 29, 2008.
[16:54.460 --> 16:55.500]  Gold, $891.
[16:55.500 --> 16:59.460]  The Honseco coins can be purchased for $917.90, $452.15
[16:59.460 --> 17:01.500]  for half to $2608 per quarter.
[17:01.500 --> 17:05.980]  That's $917.90, $452.15, and $2608.
[17:05.980 --> 17:07.820]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position
[17:07.820 --> 17:09.620]  to uphold constitutional rights.
[17:09.620 --> 17:11.620]  He's been branded by special interest groups
[17:11.620 --> 17:14.140]  as Dr. Noel, refusing to bend his values.
[17:14.140 --> 17:16.460]  I could only imagine the pressure applied by Congress
[17:16.460 --> 17:18.540]  as he stands alone for these principles.
[17:18.540 --> 17:20.860]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[17:20.860 --> 17:22.860]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[17:22.860 --> 17:25.500]  The ideas of strong currency ending the war,
[17:25.500 --> 17:28.140]  defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties
[17:28.140 --> 17:29.100]  are catching on.
[17:29.100 --> 17:32.740]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources and I
[17:32.740 --> 17:35.380]  would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family
[17:35.380 --> 17:36.220]  Cookbook.
[17:36.220 --> 17:40.060]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[17:40.060 --> 17:43.500]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[17:43.500 --> 17:45.540]  I hope his values are touching your heart
[17:45.540 --> 17:46.780]  as deep as they are mine.
[17:46.780 --> 17:49.580]  That's 800-686-2237.
[17:49.580 --> 17:53.460]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[17:53.460 --> 17:57.220]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[17:57.220 --> 17:59.740]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us,
[17:59.740 --> 18:02.260]  it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[18:02.260 --> 18:05.020]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million,
[18:05.020 --> 18:07.740]  the vast majority of the population of the US.
[18:07.740 --> 18:10.500]  Though the people of the US, where their numbers and influence
[18:10.500 --> 18:12.660]  are strongest, have primary responsibility
[18:12.660 --> 18:15.060]  for reigning the men and bringing them to justice,
[18:15.060 --> 18:18.740]  all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[18:18.740 --> 18:21.660]  They are called Illuminati, elite, opponents
[18:21.660 --> 18:23.140]  of the New World Order.
[18:23.140 --> 18:25.900]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[18:25.900 --> 18:29.420]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[18:29.420 --> 18:31.420]  Everything they have built over the centuries,
[18:31.420 --> 18:33.540]  the wealth they have accumulated, the power
[18:33.540 --> 18:36.060]  they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[18:36.060 --> 18:38.420]  the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[18:38.420 --> 18:40.380]  we will undo through the authority that
[18:40.380 --> 18:42.460]  has now been delegated to us.

[19:12.740 --> 19:15.460]  to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[19:15.460 --> 19:18.020]  HHO, also called Brown's Gas, burns beautifully
[19:18.020 --> 19:19.580]  and provides tons of energy.

[20:00.340 --> 20:02.340]  [?].
[20:16.340 --> 20:20.380]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:20.380 --> 20:21.940]  Phone lines are completely jammed.
[20:21.940 --> 20:23.380]  I want to take your calls.
[20:23.380 --> 20:25.420]  In fact, we'll just do that now instead of making everybody
[20:25.420 --> 20:28.540]  awake to the second hour like I do half the time.
[20:28.540 --> 20:30.580]  Then later, we'll get into the big diversion, the big
[20:30.580 --> 20:31.300]  distraction.
[20:31.300 --> 20:35.260]  Looks like Barack Obama is cinching and all of Hillary
[20:35.260 --> 20:37.660]  Clinton's still throwing fits.
[20:37.660 --> 20:38.420]  Does it matter?
[20:38.420 --> 20:39.260]  Absolutely not.
[20:39.260 --> 20:44.540]  Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Barack Obama, no
[20:44.540 --> 20:45.860]  difference in their policies.
[20:45.860 --> 20:47.580]  They all work for the same people.
[20:47.580 --> 20:48.580]  They're puppets.
[20:48.580 --> 20:50.540]  And so we'll talk about that later.
[20:50.540 --> 20:52.700]  Also, I'm going to chime in on the whole Scott McClellan
[20:52.700 --> 20:55.100]  thing you've been hearing about all week and tell you
[20:55.100 --> 20:58.020]  that it's all a big distraction itself.
[20:58.020 --> 21:00.460]  What McClellan has said in his book, it's hundreds of
[21:00.460 --> 21:02.020]  times worse.
[21:02.020 --> 21:03.620]  And it's not my opinion.
[21:03.620 --> 21:05.380]  You can go to the executive orders.
[21:05.380 --> 21:06.780]  You can go to the documents.
[21:06.780 --> 21:08.860]  You can go to the CIA assessments.
[21:08.860 --> 21:11.540]  Of course, they knew there were no WMDs.
[21:11.540 --> 21:15.940]  Of course, they'd had the UN there for what, since 91
[21:15.940 --> 21:18.260]  through 2002.
[21:18.260 --> 21:19.780]  And they'd torn the whole place apart and
[21:19.780 --> 21:21.180]  destroyed everything.
[21:21.180 --> 21:23.900]  And the US and England had sold him almost everything that
[21:23.900 --> 21:25.220]  was, quote, questionable.
[21:25.220 --> 21:27.700]  World War I, World War II-style chemicals and
[21:27.700 --> 21:30.180]  biologicals.
[21:30.180 --> 21:31.180]  But I'm already digressing.
[21:31.180 --> 21:32.300]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[21:32.300 --> 21:34.660]  It's just unbelievable.
[21:34.660 --> 21:37.740]  For anybody that wants to know how they're lying to you,
[21:37.740 --> 21:39.180]  they are on the news again.
[21:39.180 --> 21:42.620]  And I saw this week headlines with the White House says,
[21:42.620 --> 21:46.860]  Iran is with al-Qaeda, running al-Qaeda in Iraq.
[21:46.860 --> 21:49.500]  Now, every week I talk about this.
[21:49.500 --> 21:51.460]  I mean, I can't get over this.
[21:51.460 --> 21:55.700]  I am begging you out there who are mainline conservatives.
[21:55.700 --> 21:58.020]  Have you seen the government treble in size?
[21:58.020 --> 22:01.060]  Have you seen the gun control increase, the open borders?
[22:01.060 --> 22:02.580]  Okay, Bush isn't a conservative.
[22:02.580 --> 22:03.580]  He's a puppet.
[22:03.580 --> 22:04.700]  He runs nothing.
[22:04.700 --> 22:07.940]  The big foreign banks are basically getting all of our
[22:07.940 --> 22:09.940]  assets through corporate welfare, the destroying the
[22:09.940 --> 22:13.180]  dollar by design, to come in and buy things up cheaply.
[22:13.180 --> 22:16.260]  The whole left-right system is a big distraction, a smoke
[22:16.260 --> 22:21.540]  screen, while the Fortune 500 multinationalized everything.
[22:21.540 --> 22:25.380]  And they write books on it and policy reports and think tank
[22:25.380 --> 22:26.380]  documents.
[22:26.380 --> 22:27.380]  All of this is public.
[22:27.380 --> 22:32.460]  If you'll just take some time out to research what I'm saying.
[22:32.460 --> 22:33.580]  But don't believe me.
[22:33.580 --> 22:39.580]  Just go look into this basic fact, please.
[22:39.580 --> 22:43.180]  Iran is a religious Shiite state.
[22:43.180 --> 22:45.300]  It is not Arab.
[22:45.300 --> 22:47.980]  It is Persian.
[22:47.980 --> 22:51.940]  It's where central Asia begins.
[22:51.940 --> 23:03.300]  They are more Caucasian slash mix of Asian than what you have with the Arabs.
[23:03.300 --> 23:05.340]  It is a totally different culture.
[23:05.340 --> 23:07.940]  I hear them on the news all the time, calling them Arabs.
[23:07.940 --> 23:09.420]  And let's kill those Arabs in Iran.
[23:09.420 --> 23:11.500]  I mean, just a little look.
[23:11.500 --> 23:13.260]  Stop being schmucks.
[23:13.260 --> 23:17.900]  Stop letting fake conservatives on talk radio in the news and the Pentagon with all its black
[23:17.900 --> 23:20.300]  op people putting out propaganda.
[23:20.300 --> 23:22.780]  The Pentagon works for foreign private banks.
[23:22.780 --> 23:28.860]  They admit they're making the U.S. a quote control grid for the confiscation of your
[23:28.860 --> 23:32.980]  wealth, your transfer of your wealth through taxes and regulations to the elite who go
[23:32.980 --> 23:33.980]  offshore.
[23:33.980 --> 23:36.620]  You understand that?
[23:36.620 --> 23:38.100]  Your mind's a computer.
[23:38.100 --> 23:40.660]  You've been given false maps, false terms.
[23:40.660 --> 23:46.140]  You've got to at least wake up to the fact you've been lied to, but I digress.
[23:46.140 --> 23:49.380]  Iran is Shiite.
[23:49.380 --> 23:52.940]  Their government, their ruling Islamic council is Shiite.
[23:52.940 --> 23:57.100]  That is arch enemies.
[23:57.100 --> 24:03.460]  The Shiites and the other branch of Islam are arch enemies.
[24:03.460 --> 24:15.940]  The Sunnis out of the religious system based in Mecca in Saudi Arabia, their most radical
[24:15.940 --> 24:27.340]  sect is the Wahhabist and the British 90 years ago, the Germans 65 years ago, the United
[24:27.340 --> 24:34.220]  States 55 years ago went in, radicalized, paid them, had them go in, kill secular governments,
[24:34.220 --> 24:38.620]  kill elected governments because they would, would they want an elected government where
[24:38.620 --> 24:41.420]  the people have freedom and get to have their own oil wells and make money?
[24:41.420 --> 24:42.420]  No.
[24:42.420 --> 24:47.940]  They'd go hire Wahhabists to go kill everybody and then they'd go in and wipe everybody out
[24:47.940 --> 24:50.820]  and then they'd put in an Islamic government.
[24:50.820 --> 24:54.060]  So again, this is a mainline history.
[24:54.060 --> 25:00.340]  The crooks running our government for at least 60 years now with the British, they put them
[25:00.340 --> 25:01.840]  in.
[25:01.840 --> 25:07.380]  Over through Mosaddegh and 53 and Iran, I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[25:07.380 --> 25:13.100]  Now, the New Yorker magazine, four years ago, I reported five years ago, a year ago, the
[25:13.100 --> 25:19.580]  White House admitted what we already knew, US special forces are all over Iran, the north,
[25:19.580 --> 25:24.620]  the south, the east, the west, the central area, running Wahhabi al-Qaeda groups, three
[25:24.620 --> 25:26.020]  major Wahhabi groups.
[25:26.020 --> 25:31.300]  They call any Wahhabist Mamujahideen group a al-Qaeda, which was the CIA computer name
[25:31.300 --> 25:32.300]  for it in 79.
[25:32.300 --> 25:35.820]  And they officially set up that operation under Zbigniew Brzezinski and Jimmy Carter
[25:35.820 --> 25:37.500]  to get the Russians to attack.
[25:37.500 --> 25:40.940]  By the way, Brzezinski's already written a book about it, it's been declassified now.
[25:40.940 --> 25:47.140]  You go see movies with Tom Hanks, Charlie Wilson's war, total fiction, just totally
[25:47.140 --> 25:52.460]  made up.
[25:52.460 --> 25:58.380]  Paul just popped in and said he just watched that.
[25:58.380 --> 26:06.060]  So this is a type of issue that I, as someone who's informed, have to deal with seeing you
[26:06.060 --> 26:07.660]  being kind of manipulated.
[26:07.660 --> 26:12.020]  So that said, Iran is Shi'i.
[26:12.020 --> 26:15.460]  Saudi Arabia, where if you believe the official story, all the hijackers came from and the
[26:15.460 --> 26:17.620]  attacks were run from, notice they never got invaded.
[26:17.620 --> 26:18.620]  They never got attacked.
[26:18.620 --> 26:23.300]  James Baker, former Secretary of State, he went and blocked families from suing them.
[26:23.300 --> 26:25.620]  They own the Kallal group with the Bushes and the Queen of England.
[26:25.620 --> 26:29.580]  Go look at who owns it.
[26:29.580 --> 26:35.380]  They make all the big money off the no-bed defense contracts, hundreds of billions.
[26:35.380 --> 26:38.500]  Frank Carlucci, I mean, learn all these names.
[26:38.500 --> 26:45.940]  So the news keeps saying that Iran is with al-Qaeda, that Iran is attacking Iraq and
[26:45.940 --> 26:54.340]  attacking the troops, the Iraqi forces, U.S. forces, British forces, and that Iran is doing
[26:54.340 --> 27:00.940]  all this meanwhile in reality, while they put that on the nightly news for the dumb
[27:00.940 --> 27:05.620]  down people halfway watching TV while they cook steaks on their grill at home, and they
[27:05.620 --> 27:09.460]  think those dirty Iranians are running attacks with al-Qaeda.
[27:09.460 --> 27:14.660]  In real publications and White House press releases, they say, yes, number three in al-Qaeda
[27:14.660 --> 27:15.820]  works for us.
[27:15.820 --> 27:17.580]  He is running attacks.
[27:17.580 --> 27:20.340]  We've been attacking for five years.
[27:20.340 --> 27:21.340]  We blew up a mosque.
[27:21.340 --> 27:22.380]  We blew up a police station.
[27:22.380 --> 27:26.620]  We shot a bunch of kids getting in a school bus, trying to get Iran to attack.
[27:26.620 --> 27:29.980]  And Iran, since they're taking it, putting out releases going, you've blown up our mosque
[27:29.980 --> 27:32.740]  again, and then the U.S. goes on.
[27:32.740 --> 27:36.540]  Now they come out on Fox to its mixed propaganda and go, yeah, we're blowing stuff up.
[27:36.540 --> 27:42.180]  They have generals on TV going, yeah, we blew up their mosque.
[27:42.180 --> 27:47.140]  So the propaganda is so crazy that on one newscast, Fox News will go, yeah, we're running terror
[27:47.140 --> 27:49.460]  attacks in there with our people.
[27:49.460 --> 27:52.220]  They don't say they're al-Qaeda, though you'll read the group it is.
[27:52.220 --> 27:59.780]  In another newscast, they'll say, Iran is al-Qaeda, and Iran's running al-Qaeda attacks.
[27:59.780 --> 28:04.940]  When Saudi Arabia and Iran, one Wahhabis, the other Shiite, have always been killing
[28:04.940 --> 28:08.580]  each other.
[28:08.580 --> 28:12.500]  And I mean, how dumb do they think you are?
[28:12.500 --> 28:17.100]  And I guess some of you are, because I hear mainstream so-called conservative talk radio
[28:17.100 --> 28:19.900]  every day, and they're going, yeah, Iran's behind al-Qaeda.
[28:19.900 --> 28:21.380]  We got a nukem.
[28:21.380 --> 28:28.220]  And I'm like, but our government runs al-Qaeda, admittedly, and has them attacking Iran.
[28:28.220 --> 28:33.860]  I mean, it's just, it's so, the propaganda is so baseline, because they know you're tuned
[28:33.860 --> 28:34.860]  out of reality.
[28:34.860 --> 28:37.540]  I promise your calls, straight ahead on the other side.
[28:37.540 --> 28:38.540]  Huge news as well.

[29:53.060 --> 29:57.500]  According to the EPA, our indoor air is many times more polluted than outdoor air.
[29:57.500 --> 29:59.540]  One child in 10 suffers from asthma.
[29:59.540 --> 30:01.300]  How can we improve the air we breathe?

[30:52.100 --> 30:58.100]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[30:58.100 --> 31:01.060]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's

[33:25.980 --> 33:26.980]  are controlled.
[33:26.980 --> 33:30.500]  You get dental work done.
[33:30.500 --> 33:34.820]  You fill out when you're going in to have your baby six months later that you've taken
[33:34.820 --> 33:38.580]  those drugs, CPS comes, and takes your child.
[33:38.580 --> 33:41.820]  You say, but the doctor gave me this and they test your blood that's not in you, you're
[33:41.820 --> 33:42.820]  out on them.
[33:42.820 --> 33:44.500]  They say, sorry, your kid's gone.
[33:44.500 --> 33:49.940]  We're going to get about 400 grand, 300 grand, depending on the type of baby.
[33:49.940 --> 33:52.500]  That's right, different babies go for different prices.
[33:52.500 --> 33:55.300]  Young healthy white couples are particularly targeted.
[33:55.300 --> 33:57.380]  The government's criminal now, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:57.380 --> 34:01.980]  It's not completely criminal, but it is filled with criminals and they operate with almost
[34:01.980 --> 34:02.980]  invincible impunity.
[34:02.980 --> 34:07.620]  And if you're rolling your eyes, don't forget of thousands of points I can make, the Texas
[34:07.620 --> 34:10.260]  Youth Commission, and it's the same in every state.
[34:10.260 --> 34:14.820]  You can look up Florida's even worse, where they would have huge rape parties and videotape
[34:14.820 --> 34:17.700]  it at facilities all over the state.
[34:17.700 --> 34:20.180]  The Texas Rangers were told to shut up and drop it.
[34:20.180 --> 34:26.180]  People would come into the facilities all over and pay to go in and rape the children.
[34:26.180 --> 34:30.660]  The government is five times more likely in just department numbers to abuse children
[34:30.660 --> 34:32.460]  than any other group.
[34:32.460 --> 34:33.900]  But I'll be going over that.
[34:33.900 --> 34:38.020]  So absolute enforcement of stuff that doesn't even exist, saying you've got to take vaccines
[34:38.020 --> 34:41.620]  and they'll take your kids when there's no law, now they're trying to pass laws.
[34:41.620 --> 34:42.620]  It's a nightmare.
[34:42.620 --> 34:43.700]  It's happening.
[34:43.700 --> 34:44.940]  And government can't help themselves.
[34:44.940 --> 34:46.820]  They're on mad dog power trips.
[34:46.820 --> 34:47.820]  It's growing.
[34:47.820 --> 34:48.820]  Again, it's tripled.
[34:48.820 --> 34:54.020]  Federal government tripled in the last seven years and it's going to triple again.
[34:54.020 --> 34:59.140]  And new taxes, there's like five new taxes the last two years in Texas.
[34:59.140 --> 35:01.060]  I mean, it's the same all over the country.
[35:01.060 --> 35:02.060]  Just they're coming.
[35:02.060 --> 35:03.060]  It's cancer.
[35:03.060 --> 35:07.340]  The country's got cancer and it's not going to stop and just get ready.
[35:07.340 --> 35:10.140]  Just get ready and get ready for absolute enslavement.
[35:10.140 --> 35:11.140]  You want to be slaves?
[35:11.140 --> 35:12.620]  Well, you're going to get it.
[35:12.620 --> 35:19.740]  Also a new overdue home loans, swamp effort to fix defaults from Bloomberg Financial,
[35:19.740 --> 35:23.860]  beta testing, carbon consciousness, what the new carbon taxes are going to mean to you
[35:23.860 --> 35:26.500]  here in the United States and worldwide.
[35:26.500 --> 35:27.660]  That is some of the news we have.
[35:27.660 --> 35:30.700]  But right now, as promised, let's go through your calls.
[35:30.700 --> 35:34.060]  Nick in Maryland, you're on the air first.
[35:34.060 --> 35:35.060]  Thank you for holding.
[35:35.060 --> 35:36.060]  Hello?
[35:36.060 --> 35:37.060]  Yes, sir.
[35:37.060 --> 35:38.060]  You're on the air.
[35:38.060 --> 35:43.780]  I was wondering about that article recently in the Asian Times about a pair of rumors
[35:43.780 --> 35:46.340]  of the U.S. claims to bomb Iran.
[35:46.340 --> 35:50.500]  I think that they definitely want to, but I remember hearing rumors from NPR back in
[35:50.500 --> 35:56.740]  2006 and other articles through 2007, how much truth do you think it holds?
[35:56.740 --> 36:00.900]  Well, we're going to find out in the next seven, eight months how much it holds.
[36:00.900 --> 36:02.780]  I mean, that's a big question.
[36:02.780 --> 36:06.380]  You want to hold and hear my answer and then say more, or do you want to hear my answer?
[36:06.380 --> 36:10.300]  I'd like to hear your answer, what do you think about it?
[36:10.300 --> 36:11.300]  Okay.
[36:11.300 --> 36:12.780]  Man, that's a huge issue.
[36:12.780 --> 36:13.780]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[36:13.780 --> 36:16.220]  I'm going to have the background noise while I answer the question and then I'll go back
[36:16.220 --> 36:17.460]  to you in a moment, sir.
[36:17.460 --> 36:20.980]  Let me try to be as simple as possible.
[36:20.980 --> 36:24.500]  The White House lied and took us to war with Afghanistan.
[36:24.500 --> 36:27.820]  They cooked that whole deal up, and I've got the evidence to prove it.
[36:27.820 --> 36:30.020]  It's come out.
[36:30.020 --> 36:31.700]  They cooked up the whole deal with Iraq.
[36:31.700 --> 36:33.820]  That of course has come out.
[36:33.820 --> 36:38.940]  The PNAC documents said they wanted to stage terror attacks and then hit this list of countries.
[36:38.940 --> 36:45.860]  Iraq is next on the list, then Syria, and then Iran, and they've done that.
[36:45.860 --> 36:49.260]  So they're in Iraq, now they want Iran and Syria.
[36:49.260 --> 36:53.020]  They admit there's no WMDs, plus Israel's got 400 of them.
[36:53.020 --> 36:58.540]  I mean, since when can our government gave nukes to Pakistan who's threatening their
[36:58.540 --> 36:59.540]  neighbors?
[36:59.540 --> 37:00.540]  But that's okay.
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.540]  That's Balkanization.
[37:01.540 --> 37:05.740]  They do that to menace, I think of the United States, those that control us.
[37:05.740 --> 37:09.660]  It's not the U.S. that's doing this, but the corporate interests that control our government,
[37:09.660 --> 37:10.660]  the coup.
[37:10.660 --> 37:11.660]  What is a coup?
[37:11.660 --> 37:15.820]  Go look at the definition, but it's a small group that gets into key positions in government.
[37:15.820 --> 37:20.020]  And then uses those positions to overthrow the rest of the government.
[37:20.020 --> 37:21.020]  And that's now what's happened.
[37:21.020 --> 37:23.100]  These big corporate interests have fully controlled our government.
[37:23.100 --> 37:24.780]  They use fronts to confuses.
[37:24.780 --> 37:28.180]  They bring in every four to eight years new puppets who take the blame for everything.
[37:28.180 --> 37:31.980]  They remove them like birdcage liner, put in a new liner, and then move the agenda down
[37:31.980 --> 37:32.980]  the field.
[37:32.980 --> 37:34.540]  And the public's fooled by it again and again.
[37:34.540 --> 37:37.580]  Now they know you're not being fooled, so they're putting in electronic fraud-driven
[37:37.580 --> 37:42.300]  machines, they're militarizing police, building FEMA camps, training the cops for riot patrol,
[37:42.300 --> 37:45.980]  training the military to go into domestic cities, admitting it, you know, in case you
[37:45.980 --> 37:49.620]  don't like it when they take your pension funds and your whole future and draft your
[37:49.620 --> 37:50.620]  kids.
[37:50.620 --> 37:52.700]  If you don't like it, they're going to kill you.
[37:52.700 --> 37:54.780]  You don't like them shooting your kid up full of mercury.
[37:54.780 --> 37:55.780]  They're going to swat team you.
[37:55.780 --> 37:57.980]  I mean, these people would have tried to leave with their kid.
[37:57.980 --> 37:58.980]  Swat team would have come and killed them.
[37:58.980 --> 38:01.180]  And when I say that, I'm not joking.
[38:01.180 --> 38:02.620]  This is Nazi deadly force.
[38:02.620 --> 38:03.860]  This is the end of liberty.
[38:03.860 --> 38:05.780]  This is going into hardcore tyranny.
[38:05.780 --> 38:11.260]  They're powerful sociopathic people that got all these PR firms and propaganda firms.
[38:11.260 --> 38:12.260]  They want war.
[38:12.260 --> 38:13.260]  They want power.
[38:13.260 --> 38:14.260]  They want control.
[38:14.260 --> 38:15.260]  And they're coming for everybody.
[38:15.260 --> 38:17.540]  And they've got a bunch of the yuppies and other people convinced they're part of the
[38:17.540 --> 38:20.500]  power system that they're not coming for them.
[38:20.500 --> 38:24.060]  I was listening to local radio station last week driving into work and they were saying,
[38:24.060 --> 38:25.860]  good, let's loot all the oil out of Iraq.
[38:25.860 --> 38:27.460]  I don't like paying four bucks a gallon.
[38:27.460 --> 38:29.220]  Let's go rob them people.
[38:29.220 --> 38:32.700]  You know, just now the neocons are kind of getting honest about what they are.
[38:32.700 --> 38:37.260]  But see, low-level dumb neocons understand they're schmucks.
[38:37.260 --> 38:38.940]  You're not going to be looting Iraq.
[38:38.940 --> 38:41.240]  You're not part of the multinational elite.
[38:41.240 --> 38:42.700]  This isn't America that's doing this.
[38:42.700 --> 38:44.380]  We're just fitting the bill.
[38:44.380 --> 38:45.700]  They get the spoils.
[38:45.700 --> 38:47.300]  You're going to get looted too, dummy.
[38:47.300 --> 38:53.420]  I mean, when they'll carry out siege for 17 years, 18 years against Iraq, kill more than
[38:53.420 --> 38:57.740]  three million of them, a million since the five-year war, but three million total.
[38:57.740 --> 39:03.340]  Those are the real numbers and misplaced another three million.
[39:03.340 --> 39:06.860]  You think they care about you too, dummy?
[39:06.860 --> 39:08.740]  People think they're members of the establishment.
[39:08.740 --> 39:10.700]  They think they're members of the elite.
[39:10.700 --> 39:14.020]  And so now there's just this open evil of, yeah, let's just rob everybody.
[39:14.020 --> 39:15.860]  I want my oil prices to go down.
[39:15.860 --> 39:20.900]  Hey, dummy, the globalists went into Iraq and stated in white papers that it was to
[39:20.900 --> 39:24.780]  drive up oil prices by shutting off Iraqi oil.
[39:24.780 --> 39:28.380]  You hear neocons all the time go, we didn't go in there to get oil.
[39:28.380 --> 39:29.380]  That was the case.
[39:29.380 --> 39:30.620]  We'd be selling oil.
[39:30.620 --> 39:35.980]  Well, no, actually, they first attacked Saddam, who was set up by the CIA and put in power
[39:35.980 --> 39:39.980]  when he tried to pay off his bills and wouldn't accept a foreign central bank.
[39:39.980 --> 39:44.700]  You know, 30-something billion to the U.S. and others, because he remember he was over-pumping
[39:44.700 --> 39:48.980]  in 1990 and gas prices were like 85 to 95 cents a gallon.
[39:48.980 --> 39:54.260]  And remember it was in the news, Saddam's over-pumping, OPEC's mad.
[39:54.260 --> 39:56.660]  Then the U.S. told him, go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[39:56.660 --> 39:57.980]  He followed orders and did it.
[39:57.980 --> 40:00.900]  It was even on tape with April Gillespie because he wanted to make sure.
[40:00.900 --> 40:02.300]  He said, I'm going to invade them.
[40:02.300 --> 40:03.820]  And she said, we don't get involved.
[40:03.820 --> 40:05.500]  We know we were allies with you.
[40:05.500 --> 40:11.980]  They ordered him to attack Iran for eight years, and then they set him up because they
[40:11.980 --> 40:15.220]  won't want any industrialized First World nation over there.
[40:15.220 --> 40:18.980]  This is three-dimensional, high-level chess, folks, and you can't even play checkers.
[40:18.980 --> 40:22.380]  The neural public doesn't even know that Iran's fighting al-Qaeda.
[40:22.380 --> 40:25.260]  The public believes they are al-Qaeda.
[40:25.260 --> 40:28.260]  You know, I said I'd take a lot of calls, but these are important issues.
[40:28.260 --> 40:35.540]  So we have two senators reported by the Asian Times saying that, yes, there is a plan to
[40:35.540 --> 40:37.860]  attack Iran before Bush leaves.
[40:37.860 --> 40:42.220]  When Bush was over in Israel a few weeks ago, high-level Israeli ministers reported in the
[40:42.220 --> 40:47.500]  Jerusalem Post, and Israeli Army Radio reported that the U.S. will back and attack within
[40:47.500 --> 40:50.380]  the next seven months, probably within August.
[40:50.380 --> 40:53.540]  Now, I don't know if we're going to do that, just like the White House said they were going
[40:53.540 --> 40:58.220]  to attack Iraq in 2002, but it was really 2003.
[40:58.220 --> 41:00.940]  So I don't know what's going to happen.
[41:00.940 --> 41:05.260]  They got carriers over there, three of them, a couple other attack groups.
[41:05.260 --> 41:07.980]  The troops have been building up, not building down.
[41:07.980 --> 41:12.820]  They've been lying every month saying that they found conventional Iranian weapons, always
[41:12.820 --> 41:16.860]  turns out they're Russian or U.S. or Egyptian.
[41:16.860 --> 41:19.660]  They make some mortars and weapons.
[41:19.660 --> 41:23.020]  And then, you know, later there's a retraction, okay, it wasn't, it was Russian.
[41:23.020 --> 41:26.500]  But Betrayus comes out and lies, knowing the general public doesn't really listen.
[41:26.500 --> 41:30.220]  I mean, how, you know, they laugh at you, like they even write books laughing and going,
[41:30.220 --> 41:34.500]  these idiots don't even know we run Al-Qaeda, and that Al-Qaeda is attacking Iran.
[41:34.500 --> 41:36.180]  And Iran just sits there taking it.
[41:36.180 --> 41:37.420]  Every week they blow up a mosque.
[41:37.420 --> 41:42.980]  Every week, our special forces, and again I say ours, people that we call American, attack
[41:42.980 --> 41:47.060]  with Al-Qaeda, blow up mosque, shoot cops, blow up school buses.
[41:47.060 --> 41:50.300]  The Iranian people are mad, they're saying attack, fight back.
[41:50.300 --> 41:54.260]  The Iranians have ordered their ships to basically stay in port so they don't get attacked like
[41:54.260 --> 41:58.020]  they did when they, you know, right after the last Gulf War when they blow up a bunch
[41:58.020 --> 41:59.020]  of their battleships.
[41:59.020 --> 42:00.020]  And that's that psychology.
[42:00.020 --> 42:01.020]  I said, we blew them up.
[42:01.020 --> 42:03.980]  This is an America that's doing this.
[42:03.980 --> 42:07.060]  And yeah, you didn't know we've attacked Iran before?
[42:07.060 --> 42:11.340]  And so they're just standing down, attack, attack, dams being blown up, people being
[42:11.340 --> 42:12.840]  shot in mass.
[42:12.840 --> 42:16.620]  Does that answer your question, sir?
[42:16.620 --> 42:18.340]  Yes, it does.
[42:18.340 --> 42:19.540]  Okay, thank you.
[42:19.540 --> 42:20.940]  Now, I'm going to try to hurry.
[42:20.940 --> 42:23.780]  We get back Chris, Robert, Steve, Tony, Adam.
[42:23.780 --> 42:27.140]  Many others, when we get back, we are going to go to your calls.
[42:27.140 --> 42:31.540]  Somehow I'll have to cut the answer short, but that's the bottom line on what's happening.
[42:31.540 --> 42:32.540]  We'll be right back.
[42:32.540 --> 42:54.980]  Hi, my name is William Lewis.
[42:54.980 --> 42:59.020]  And if you're listening to this radio station, then chances are, you've probably seen one
[42:59.020 --> 43:03.580]  or two of the documentaries that I've made over the years, 9-1-1 in plain sight, Beyond
[43:03.580 --> 43:06.780]  Treason, or maybe 9-1-1 Ripple Effect.
[43:06.780 --> 43:11.500]  And by now, you've got to be as angry as I am and wondering, what else have they done
[43:11.500 --> 43:13.740]  and what are we going to do about it?
[43:13.740 --> 43:18.940]  My latest documentary, Washington You're Fired, was made to explore these ideas of change while
[43:18.940 --> 43:23.780]  at the same time, exposing the scope of the president's immoral and illegal spy program,
[43:23.780 --> 43:28.780]  we reveal the abuses committed under the Protection of the Patriot Act, Military Commissions
[43:28.780 --> 43:32.020]  Act, and other very intrusive spy bills.
[43:32.020 --> 43:37.700]  Washington You're Fired explores the removal of habeas corpus, posicumetatus, and the subversion
[43:37.700 --> 43:40.020]  of our entire Bill of Rights.

[44:54.060 --> 44:58.020]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States
[44:58.020 --> 45:01.540]  create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[45:01.540 --> 45:05.220]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[45:05.220 --> 45:09.700]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to

[45:14.980 --> 45:19.180]  eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit and other unsecured debts
[45:19.180 --> 45:21.460]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[45:21.460 --> 45:25.660]  You can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[45:25.660 --> 45:27.620]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[45:27.620 --> 45:31.580]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally

[46:52.620 --> 46:57.620]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[46:57.620 --> 47:01.620]  Home to hard hitting talk radio.
[47:01.620 --> 47:10.620]  Coming to you from the capitol of Texas broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this
[47:10.620 --> 47:15.780]  is The Alex Jones Show.
[47:15.780 --> 47:22.420]  She's a famous lady on the cooking channel, a chef, and she wore a scarf around her neck,
[47:22.420 --> 47:27.020]  which had been in style the last year, I've seen women wearing scarves.
[47:27.020 --> 47:33.020]  In a shoot they did, it looked nothing to do with Islam, and Michelle Malkin, who's married
[47:33.020 --> 47:37.500]  a Rhodes Scholar, big globalist, she knows the manipulation, came out and had Dunkin'
[47:37.500 --> 47:42.980]  Donuts pull the TV ad saying it was an Islamic thing.
[47:42.980 --> 47:50.700]  Meanwhile, the United States is funding three separate al-Qaeda groups with the number three
[47:50.700 --> 47:56.220]  in al-Qaeda, the guy they say is number three, attacking and killing Iranians, but that's
[47:56.220 --> 47:57.220]  not an issue.
[47:57.220 --> 48:00.660]  See, that's like freedom fries and banning things from France.
[48:00.660 --> 48:05.140]  It's just mindless, it's base, it's meant for you to kind of halfway hear, yeah, she's
[48:05.140 --> 48:13.980]  wearing Muslim stuff, do, ban things, ban them, that's conservative.
[48:13.980 --> 48:17.260]  Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch says the Democrats are going to sweep everything and he's going
[48:17.260 --> 48:18.820]  to become a Democrat now.
[48:18.820 --> 48:24.020]  Of course, they betray you with fake conservatism, see, conservatism is what this country's
[48:24.020 --> 48:29.620]  really based in, and what the average person wants when they're truly polled on issues.
[48:29.620 --> 48:35.940]  See, self-sufficiency, low taxes, but then people see what George Bush conservatism is,
[48:35.940 --> 48:40.180]  senior or junior, and they say, well, I'm not a conservative, and then there's the Democrats
[48:40.180 --> 48:43.620]  with all the things they're going to do, it's only going to get worse.
[48:43.620 --> 48:48.020]  And then suddenly I'll be the darling of the mainline conservatives again, suddenly you'll
[48:48.020 --> 48:52.780]  be calling in, I agree with you, Alex Obama's really evil, man, I love you buddy, I didn't
[48:52.780 --> 48:54.900]  like you on Bush, but I like you now.
[48:54.900 --> 48:57.340]  Hey, do you understand, they control both.
[48:57.340 --> 49:00.860]  Do you understand they're destroying this country?
[49:00.860 --> 49:02.020]  What is it you don't understand here?
[49:02.020 --> 49:07.260]  I just tell the truth, let me say it again, the criminals that run our government are
[49:07.260 --> 49:12.100]  running al-Qaeda publicly, they use them to attack Serbia, declassified public, they
[49:12.100 --> 49:17.260]  use them to attack the Russians, declassified public, they use them to overthrow Iran, declassified
[49:17.260 --> 49:23.700]  public, they use them over, and I mean in 53, not in 79, over and over and over again,
[49:23.700 --> 49:27.020]  do you understand?
[49:27.020 --> 49:32.340]  The Ayatollahumani, the evidence does show work for the CIA, they had them grab hostages
[49:32.340 --> 49:36.300]  to make Carter look bad, then they gave them weapons, you got all the north admittedly
[49:36.300 --> 49:41.060]  flying cocaine around, you hail him as a conservative, he supports the drug war, busting
[49:41.060 --> 49:47.220]  people that use his product, you can't make this stuff up, it's always the opposite of
[49:47.220 --> 49:51.060]  what they tell you, they tell you it's left, it's right, they tell you it's up, it's down,
[49:51.060 --> 49:56.900]  they tell you it's black, it's white, but it's all in real government documents, in
[49:56.900 --> 50:02.060]  real reports, in real think tanks, they all laugh at us, they all have real discussions,
[50:02.060 --> 50:06.740]  it's main line, I can have sitting CIA people on my radio show, former top analysts, section
[50:06.740 --> 50:10.420]  chiefs and they go, yes, of course, absolutely, yes, we staged air attacks, we stayed, we
[50:10.420 --> 50:16.780]  did 9-11, absolutely, but then they know that I'm a minority show, by that I'm a small show
[50:16.780 --> 50:22.220]  overall, and they know the average brain wash person tuning in, can't even understand what
[50:22.220 --> 50:27.220]  I'm saying, you understand that they said in policy reports, they were going to shut
[50:27.220 --> 50:32.300]  off Iraqi oil and jack up prices, you understand they wanted that oil to stop flowing, so it
[50:32.300 --> 50:39.260]  would artificially scarce, cost more, and the dollars been devalued, don't you understand
[50:39.260 --> 50:46.700]  that, that by letting less oil flow, they make more, oh it doesn't matter, the point
[50:46.700 --> 50:51.140]  is folks, you better get informed fast, don't even believe me, you just better find out
[50:51.140 --> 50:55.740]  you're getting conned and lied to every day in ways I can't believe, our criminal government
[50:55.740 --> 51:02.180]  runs Al Qaeda publicly, attacks Iran, murders their police, their citizens, their school
[51:02.180 --> 51:12.580]  children, every week now, thousands dead, and it's all over the foreign press, Iran suing
[51:12.580 --> 51:17.380]  the U.S. government for it, the U.S. government admits they're doing it, but then the news,
[51:17.380 --> 51:22.900]  I just can't believe it, I can't believe how obvious it all is, and I'm not that smart,
[51:22.900 --> 51:27.820]  how do I know all this, and I'll be at some family event and there'll be some uncle there,
[51:27.820 --> 51:33.460]  makes 300 grand a year and is an insurance guru or whatever, smart guy, and he just laughs
[51:33.460 --> 51:37.700]  sure they're running Al Qaeda, and I'm like look, it's right here, Whitehouse.gov, press
[51:37.700 --> 51:45.260]  release, sure, you know, it's just, we'll not listen, we'll not wake up, we'll not
[51:45.260 --> 51:50.620]  hear what I'm saying, I said I'd take calls, it's just, I want to warn people, Adam and
[51:50.620 --> 51:52.660]  St. Louis, you're on the air, go ahead.
[51:52.660 --> 51:57.580]  Yeah, Alex, I wanted to get your advice on something, but first I just want to say something
[51:57.580 --> 52:01.060]  that's interesting to me, like a couple years ago when I was seeing the movie, A Scanner
[52:01.060 --> 52:05.100]  Darkly, like they had like the characters in that movie, they went from their house
[52:05.100 --> 52:08.020]  to their stores, back to their house, and then like intersection cameras would follow
[52:08.020 --> 52:12.060]  their every move, and then they would have like home insecurity people watching them.
[52:12.060 --> 52:13.780]  Yeah, I consulted on that film.
[52:13.780 --> 52:16.860]  Yeah, I know, you're like a street prophet or something like that.
[52:16.860 --> 52:20.340]  Yeah, I'm also in the film, but I also consulted on it.
[52:20.340 --> 52:25.660]  Yeah, I mean, it's a great movie, and I urge all your listeners to go out and watch it,
[52:25.660 --> 52:27.060]  but back when I was watching it, I was saying.
[52:27.060 --> 52:33.140]  It's got Downey Jr. in it, it's got Keanu Reeves, Tommy, it's just got someone, my good
[52:33.140 --> 52:36.020]  buddy Tommy Pallotto was a producer on it.
[52:36.020 --> 52:40.420]  Back in 2006, I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't really informed that much, and I thought it was like
[52:40.420 --> 52:44.460]  some like scientific thing, but now like two years later, there's, there's like cameras
[52:44.460 --> 52:45.460]  on every intersection.
[52:45.460 --> 52:49.140]  And they admit to face standing you and tracking you with microphones, listening to you and
[52:49.140 --> 52:50.740]  reading your license plate.
[52:50.740 --> 52:56.700]  Yeah, and then something that I want to get your advice on is, I mean, I'm a sophomore
[52:56.700 --> 53:00.740]  at a four year college for business, I'm trying to better myself to get a better life for
[53:00.740 --> 53:05.540]  myself and my family, but like I've seen like the last year, especially like just like the
[53:05.540 --> 53:09.060]  propaganda and like all the splimitals that are in the textbooks and that the professors
[53:09.060 --> 53:13.420]  are spitting out, like you go in there and he talks about evolution and, and like robotic
[53:13.420 --> 53:16.060]  like microchips and how he's pro world government.
[53:16.060 --> 53:20.260]  And then I did a, but then you turn the news on and they say world government doesn't exist.
[53:20.260 --> 53:22.980]  Insane people talk about it, but then it's in all that they just have the North American
[53:22.980 --> 53:27.100]  Union government just met last week and had their parliament.
[53:27.100 --> 53:31.940]  And then that's admitted, but only in scholarly publications here, they just say it doesn't
[53:31.940 --> 53:32.940]  exist.
[53:32.940 --> 53:33.940]  Yeah.
[53:33.940 --> 53:36.820]  And then if you try to tell the average person about it, they're all too worried about either
[53:36.820 --> 53:41.460]  who they want McCain or Clinton for president, but they're, I mean, they're both, I mean,
[53:41.460 --> 53:42.460]  they really don't matter.
[53:42.460 --> 53:43.460]  I mean, I total diversion.
[53:43.460 --> 53:47.940]  So what do you tell, what do you tell your, uh, your, uh, professor when he wants world
[53:47.940 --> 53:48.940]  government?
[53:48.940 --> 53:51.980]  Uh, I, I mean, I, I get comments all the time.
[53:51.980 --> 53:55.980]  I gave a speech on a sodium fluoride for my public speaking class and he gave me an F
[53:55.980 --> 53:58.100]  on it, but I was an excellent speech.
[53:58.100 --> 54:03.660]  I hit every point and I mean, yep, I, uh, where do you go to school again?
[54:03.660 --> 54:04.660]  What?
[54:04.660 --> 54:05.660]  Where do you go to school again?
[54:05.660 --> 54:09.420]  I go to, uh, Kansas city of Missouri.
[54:09.420 --> 54:13.940]  And this guy gave you an F because you, you went over the scientific evidence, which it's
[54:13.940 --> 54:16.140]  admitted that sodium fluoride attacks the brain.
[54:16.140 --> 54:17.140]  Yeah.
[54:17.140 --> 54:20.140]  I told him he was drinking poison and like, I mean, I looked up in the whole class of
[54:20.140 --> 54:21.140]  this like laughing at me.
[54:21.140 --> 54:23.780]  So I mean, I contend you in any way, but, oh, I know that they love it.
[54:23.780 --> 54:24.860]  I mean, they, thank you for the call.
[54:24.860 --> 54:26.380]  They love me in slaves.
[54:26.380 --> 54:27.380]  It's all so funny.
[54:27.380 --> 54:28.380]  Ha, ha, ha.
[54:28.380 --> 54:29.380]  They'll find out real fast.
[54:29.380 --> 54:31.660]  You see, we're a nation of schmucks.
[54:31.660 --> 54:34.260]  I mean, it's true.
[54:34.260 --> 54:39.360]  We were the smartest, most intelligent, hardworking, most inventive people, not just Americans
[54:39.360 --> 54:43.180]  saying that about Americans, the French, the British, the Russians, they all, the Japanese,
[54:43.180 --> 54:44.380]  they all wrote about us.
[54:44.380 --> 54:48.780]  They all came here 200 years ago, 100 years ago, 50 years ago and wrote about us.
[54:48.780 --> 54:52.340]  But we are the children of the children of spoiled brats.
[54:52.340 --> 54:55.740]  And so we're all trainers to be cynical and laugh at everything.
[54:55.740 --> 54:57.020]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[54:57.020 --> 54:58.420]  He says there's, I'm in danger.
[54:58.420 --> 54:59.620]  He says the government's corrupt.
[54:59.620 --> 55:01.860]  And I'm just going to laugh at him.
[55:01.860 --> 55:04.860]  I'm just going to deny that's happening because I don't want to have to do anything about
[55:04.860 --> 55:05.860]  it.
[55:05.860 --> 55:10.020]  And, I mean, let those idiots in that class laugh at you.
[55:10.020 --> 55:15.460]  Look, all colleges, unless it's an engineering class or something, is to train you to get
[55:15.460 --> 55:19.860]  into debt and train you how to submit to what they're saying and doing so that you never
[55:19.860 --> 55:22.980]  get out of debt, basically, and there's not going to be any jobs here unless it's in homeland
[55:22.980 --> 55:23.980]  security.
[55:23.980 --> 55:26.500]  One-tenth of college grads now are going to be homeland security related.
[55:26.500 --> 55:31.260]  So unless you're going to go be a thug, enforcer, spy master, you know, over your local slaves,
[55:31.260 --> 55:34.100]  there's no point in even going to college now.
[55:34.100 --> 55:38.660]  Most of the colleges, you know, in some cases, 95% of their funding and operations is owning
[55:38.660 --> 55:45.500]  assets and water districts and sports teams, and then only the schools, a very small percentage
[55:45.500 --> 55:46.500]  of it.
[55:46.500 --> 55:48.420]  See, the colleges aren't even colleges anymore.
[55:48.420 --> 55:51.900]  They're just fronts for money laundering operations.
[55:51.900 --> 55:54.460]  I mean, the corruption has passed light years.
[55:54.460 --> 55:57.660]  I mean, it's so bad, it's going for infinity.
[55:57.660 --> 56:01.220]  They've come up with scams and frauds and things you can't even imagine.
[56:01.220 --> 56:07.100]  The governmental slash corporate economy is thousands of times bigger than all real assets.
[56:07.100 --> 56:14.980]  They've created walls of tsunamis of liquid fiat currency and liquidity, and now they
[56:14.980 --> 56:17.660]  want to force you to sell land.
[56:17.660 --> 56:22.220]  They want to force the final few assets that are owned by the middle class to themselves.
[56:22.220 --> 56:24.140]  See, it isn't free market.
[56:24.140 --> 56:28.860]  It's about getting you in debt, creating an economic fiat system where your country,
[56:28.860 --> 56:31.340]  your corporations, everything, it's just all imploded.
[56:31.340 --> 56:32.340]  Just get ready.
[56:32.340 --> 56:33.580]  I mean, it's just, it's unspeakable.
[56:33.580 --> 56:36.500]  We don't have time to take on our call, do we?
[56:36.500 --> 56:40.100]  We'll go ahead and take one more here, then we'll come back and take more.
[56:40.100 --> 56:41.820]  Let's talk to Chris in South Carolina.
[56:41.820 --> 56:42.820]  You're on the air.
[56:42.820 --> 56:43.820]  Go ahead.
[56:43.820 --> 56:45.260]  Alex, how are you, buddy?
[56:45.260 --> 56:47.860]  I'm not too good, actually, seeing what's happening.
[56:47.860 --> 56:48.860]  Yeah.
[56:48.860 --> 56:53.340]  First of all, let me say I'm a true patriot, believe in the Constitution.
[56:53.340 --> 56:56.140]  I think we need to get back to sound money, the Bill of Rights.
[56:56.140 --> 56:59.460]  We've gotten away far away from that, and I've been listening to your talk show for
[56:59.460 --> 57:00.460]  a while now.
[57:00.460 --> 57:04.980]  I've watched several of your videos, and I checked your website for articles on a daily
[57:04.980 --> 57:05.980]  basis.
[57:05.980 --> 57:06.980]  All right.
[57:06.980 --> 57:11.060]  You know, your website is beautiful.
[57:11.060 --> 57:12.980]  You've got streaming video on there.
[57:12.980 --> 57:14.980]  I mean, it's just gorgeous.
[57:14.980 --> 57:16.700]  And you've really spent a lot of money on that.
[57:16.700 --> 57:18.380]  Well, I'm going to hold you over.
[57:18.380 --> 57:19.380]  What is your main point?
[57:19.380 --> 57:20.860]  I appreciate the compliments.
[57:20.860 --> 57:24.660]  Well, my main point, I need about two minutes to speak.
[57:24.660 --> 57:27.860]  I know you like to interrupt people, but I really want to have something important to
[57:27.860 --> 57:28.860]  tell people.
[57:28.860 --> 57:32.420]  I was watching one of your videos, which featured you talking to the camera and your
[57:32.420 --> 57:35.220]  preaching about rising up and taking back the country and everything.
[57:35.220 --> 57:36.220]  Oh, we got a break.
[57:36.220 --> 57:37.220]  Okay.
[57:37.220 --> 57:40.140]  I know the ads have got to interrupt you, but that's just the way talk radio is.
[57:40.140 --> 57:43.140]  I actually have callers on longer than the average person does.

[58:43.180 --> 58:47.820]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[58:47.820 --> 58:52.620]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[1:00:01.780 --> 1:00:06.340]  Fire Department spokesman Frank Renoso says it began before dawn on a sound stage and
[1:00:06.340 --> 1:00:08.060]  involved at least one explosion.
[1:00:08.060 --> 1:00:17.180]  We have a third alarm fire with the assistance of LA City and Burbank Fire Department.
[1:00:17.180 --> 1:00:20.300]  We have over 100 firefighters on scene.
[1:00:20.300 --> 1:00:24.380]  And Henry Ronam Clinton learns today if her hard campaigning in Puerto Rico pays off with
[1:00:24.380 --> 1:00:25.620]  a big win.
[1:00:25.620 --> 1:00:30.180]  The territory is holding its primary today to be followed Tuesday by the last two Democratic
[1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:33.060]  primaries in Montana and South Dakota.
[1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:35.500]  She says the U.S. needs universal health care.
[1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:41.700]  If we have a very, very large group of Americans who are all insured through this program I
[1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:48.140]  am proposing, you can get the price of drugs down because you've got bargaining power.
[1:00:48.140 --> 1:00:51.460]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:00:51.460 --> 1:00:55.060]  When peanuts are kettle roasted, they're extra crunchy like planters kettle roasted peanuts.
[1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:57.500]  Here to explain, kettle expert Kilgore the Ogre.
[1:00:57.500 --> 1:01:00.500]  First, you get kettle ready.
[1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:03.500]  Hey, where are my crunching nuts, Chakal?
[1:01:03.500 --> 1:01:05.500]  Uh, it's right here.
[1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:06.500]  Mischek village.
[1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:08.500]  No, no, no, it's over here!
[1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:09.500]  Take the peanuts out!
[1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:11.500]  It's raking me up out of the canning!
[1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:12.500]  Run away!
[1:01:12.500 --> 1:01:14.500]  I guess it's all about the kettle roasting.
[1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.500]  Extra crunchy kettle roasted peanuts.
[1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:18.500]  New from planters.
[1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:19.500]  Planters.
[1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:20.500]  Instinctively good.
[1:01:20.500 --> 1:01:22.500]  It's time to face the facts.
[1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:28.500]  There are over 3 billion people in China and India that are now buying cars and using gas.
[1:01:28.500 --> 1:01:30.500]  What do you think that means to gas prices?
[1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:35.500]  You could save on gas and earn extra money by working from home with the three-step plan home business system.
[1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:40.500]  Thousands of families are working from home and earning extra money with their own home business.

[1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:07.500]  Iraqi police say at least two civilians were killed.
[1:02:07.500 --> 1:02:12.500]  Elsewhere in Baghdad, another car bomb killed a traffic cop at a busy intersection.
[1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:16.500]  And the U.S. Embassy says an American soldier died in a roadside bombing.
[1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:24.500]  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sees no quick fix for the high oil prices behind America's $4-a-gallon gas.

[1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:35.500]  And a religious tolerance rally in Jakarta, Indonesia has ended in violence.

[1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:29.500]  Here's Mark Levy.
[1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:34.500]  Israel deported a Lebanese Jew who served six years in prison after being convicted of espionage.
[1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:39.500]  Then his voli returned to box with what it said were body parts of Israeli soldiers killed in the war two years ago.
[1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:41.500]  This could lead to bigger things.
[1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:45.500]  The announcement was carried live on the group's Lebanese television station.
[1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:49.500]  The freed prisoner was born to a Jewish Lebanese mother and a Shiite father.
[1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:52.500]  He was in prison in Israel for six years.
[1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:57.500]  Space shuttle Discovery is cruising toward the International Space Station.
[1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:59.500]  It's scheduled to dock tomorrow.
[1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:05.500]  The shuttle is carrying up a huge new addition for the orbiting outpost, the Japanese Science Lab.
[1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:07.500]  John Belmont witnessed the liftoff.
[1:04:07.500 --> 1:04:14.500]  Discovery rolling over to get the seven Discovery astronauts a heads up ride across the Atlantic and more than 200 miles into space.
[1:04:14.500 --> 1:04:16.500]  We'll link up with the International Space Station.
[1:04:16.500 --> 1:04:18.500]  That will happen on Monday.
[1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:26.500]  And the study has found that adding a targeted cancer drug to standard chemotherapy helped advance lung cancer patients live a month longer.
[1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:29.500]  The study is being presented today at a meeting in Chicago.
[1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:32.500]  Dr. David Johnson is with Vanderbilt University.
[1:04:32.500 --> 1:04:38.500]  For those of us who are in this particular field, we find these data very encouraging and exciting.
[1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:46.500]  And it gives us potentially another compound that we can incorporate in our therapeutic studies going forward.
[1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:50.500]  I'm Jody Jordan and that's news from the Information Radio Network.
[1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:53.500]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:59.500]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[1:04:59.500 --> 1:05:04.500]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[1:05:04.500 --> 1:05:12.500]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron.
[1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:16.500]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[1:05:16.500 --> 1:05:22.500]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:28.500]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:24.500]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:27.500]  Here's Alex Jones.
[1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:35.500]  Welcome back second hour.
[1:06:35.500 --> 1:06:38.500]  I do a four hour radio show Monday through Friday syndicated.
[1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:42.500]  Then I come in on Sundays with MS Communications and Genesis Communications.
[1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:48.500]  Then we do a syndicated two hour abbreviated final edition as we look at the week past and the week coming up.
[1:06:48.500 --> 1:06:51.500]  I do have a lot of news I'm going to be covering later.
[1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:54.500]  But I wanted to take more calls earlier in the show.
[1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:58.500]  Also talk about moves nationwide to force you to take inoculations.
[1:06:58.500 --> 1:07:01.500]  So we'll be discussing that as well.
[1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:07.500]  But right now we're taking your phone calls and we were talking to Chris in South Carolina.
[1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:12.500]  And Chris I think was building up to say he disagreed with me was saying how much he liked me and how he liked the website.
[1:07:12.500 --> 1:07:16.500]  But when I say such and such and we had to go to break, I'm guessing that's the point.
[1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:19.500]  If you disagree, sir, you don't have to preface it that you still like me.
[1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:21.500]  You can just come right in with you disagree with me.
[1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:26.500]  In fact, we don't screen your calls here unless every once in a while I say first time callers only.
[1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:29.500]  And then if you're not a first time caller, we hang up on you if I recognize you.
[1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:31.500]  I do that every few months and not very often.
[1:07:31.500 --> 1:07:38.500]  Or if you say you disagree, go to the head of the line, though most people cheat and really don't disagree and then just get to the head of the line.
[1:07:38.500 --> 1:07:41.500]  And I don't sometimes I think about suspending that long.
[1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.500]  I've been doing that for about 12 years.
[1:07:43.500 --> 1:07:50.500]  If you disagree, I think it's entertaining calls and usually they're so ill informed that it illustrates my point and I can tear them up because I just go off the facts.
[1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:55.500]  So you're in a football and baseball and acting tough and I'm into actually learning how the world works.
[1:07:55.500 --> 1:08:03.500]  And it scares me how much I know because I don't know that much, but compared to other people, it's like it's just unbelievable how much I know.
[1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:06.500]  Let's go ahead and go back to Chris in South Carolina.
[1:08:06.500 --> 1:08:08.500]  Hey, Alex.
[1:08:08.500 --> 1:08:09.500]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:10.500]  Alex.
[1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:11.500]  Okay.
[1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:12.500]  Listen, I can't go through.
[1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:13.500]  Hold on.
[1:08:13.500 --> 1:08:15.500]  I can't go through two hours of prefaces or how I interrupt.
[1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:17.500]  You got you got 60 seconds.
[1:08:17.500 --> 1:08:18.500]  Go ahead.
[1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:27.500]  When I was watching your speech against the tyranny of the elite, I just I didn't get there was a gut feeling in me that something wasn't right.
[1:08:27.500 --> 1:08:36.500]  And let me explain that because second, last week on CNN, they had a segment that featured the DC Madame scandal.
[1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:42.500]  And they said, you know, everybody on the blog is talking about it and how, you know, it wasn't a suicide and everything.
[1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:45.500]  Well, they featured your website on CNN.
[1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:49.500]  And I was thinking, you know, that's basically an advertisement for prison planet.
[1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:51.500]  We know how to make sure media works.
[1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:55.500]  If they don't want to call attention to the source, they just ignore it.
[1:08:55.500 --> 1:08:58.500]  And those things do not sit right with me.
[1:08:58.500 --> 1:09:06.500]  And I want and I had to ask myself a question when you're talking to G Edward Griffin, who was one of my heroes, by the way, just like I did.
[1:09:06.500 --> 1:09:08.500]  I want people to ask themselves a question.
[1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:14.500]  Do you feel empowered or do you feel disempowered after listening to Alex Jones?
[1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:21.500]  Do you feel as if the movement is making a difference or do you feel panicked, anxious and cut off from thinking that anything can be done?
[1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:24.500]  And I think most people will come to the conclusion I did.
[1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:26.500]  See, Alex, I don't know.
[1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:27.500]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:29.500]  You know, no, no.
[1:09:29.500 --> 1:09:30.500]  I'll just let you go.
[1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.500]  How's that sound?
[1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:34.500]  I mean, I, you know, I gave you about a minute and a half earlier.
[1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:37.500]  I just gave you about two minutes there and that's not enough for you.
[1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:48.500]  Okay, now let me address just the false claim after false claim after false claim after false claim after enduendo and canards that you just threw out there.
[1:09:48.500 --> 1:09:53.500]  Okay, you sound like the agent calling into the show.
[1:09:53.500 --> 1:10:01.500]  You say you like G Edward Griffin, but that I have him on, but that basically he's empowering people, but I'm not.
[1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:03.500]  I mean, that's basically what you're getting at.
[1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:12.500]  I bring G Edward Griffin on and he gets more members to his Freedom Force International than he gets in the previous year in one appearance on my show.
[1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:25.500]  Government agents don't have good people like G Edward Griffin empowering people and exposing the private Federal Reserve on and then say, here, raise lots of money for your group and get a bunch of people to join.
[1:10:25.500 --> 1:10:31.500]  Or bring Ron Paul on who said that he got more support from my show than anyone else.
[1:10:31.500 --> 1:10:35.500]  And then empower a movement that's got the Trilateral Commission scared.
[1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:40.500]  This show is not about Alex Jones, number one.
[1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:47.500]  It's not about getting so obsessed with me that we sit here, you know, wondering about Alex Jones.
[1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:50.500]  The media has to respond to me at times.
[1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:53.500]  The media has to cover me sometimes.
[1:10:53.500 --> 1:10:54.500]  Not very much.
[1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:59.500]  I probably get on national television about three times a year.
[1:10:59.500 --> 1:11:03.500]  And generally it's when they want a clip of some big guy.
[1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:12.500]  I've gone on like Willie Nelson saying 9-11's an inside job or Governor Ventura and they will take a clip of that and they've got to say where it came from.
[1:11:12.500 --> 1:11:15.500]  Seeing in or Fox will call up and say, we want that clip.
[1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:17.500]  What do you want?
[1:11:17.500 --> 1:11:18.500]  How much money do you want?
[1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:19.500]  I said, I don't want any money.
[1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:21.500]  Just say Alex Jones in four words dot com.
[1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:22.500]  And they say, thank you.
[1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:23.500]  We're going to fact something over.
[1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:24.500]  We need you to sign it.
[1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:27.500]  Boom, I signed it.
[1:11:27.500 --> 1:11:35.500]  Now, CNN called me and the producers wanted to have me on a bunch of their shows and they always called back and said, yeah, the higher ups don't want you on.
[1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:39.500]  I actually had A.J. Hammer, who by the way knows it's an inside.
[1:11:39.500 --> 1:11:40.500]  Well, I want to say that behind the scenes.
[1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:41.500]  I've talked to him.
[1:11:41.500 --> 1:11:43.500]  There are some good people at CNN and Fox and everywhere else.
[1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:44.500]  They're not all agents.
[1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:45.500]  It's the higher ups.
[1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:46.500]  And they're fans of the show.
[1:11:46.500 --> 1:11:48.500]  They have me on a few times.
[1:11:48.500 --> 1:11:49.500]  It gets record ratings.
[1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:52.500]  And then I talked to their producers and they go, yeah, we want you on.
[1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:56.500]  But the higher ups, the execs above programming called and said, do not put him on.
[1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:57.500]  Anymore.
[1:11:57.500 --> 1:12:01.500]  And I've had TV execs call me and go, your cue scores are incredible on television.
[1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:03.500]  People just cannot stop looking at you.
[1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:05.500]  And I'm not saying I'm good looking.
[1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:06.500]  That's not what it is.
[1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:07.500]  It's kind of like Rodney Dangerfield.
[1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:09.500]  You can't stop looking at him.
[1:12:09.500 --> 1:12:10.500]  And he's an old fact guy.
[1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:12.500]  It's that people can't stop looking at me.
[1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:21.500]  I mean, it just TV execs have told me and they've actually had my cue scores done at some companies without me even knowing and later told me about it very high, very high.
[1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:27.500]  For some reason, my mannerisms, the way I look, the way I talk, you really can.
[1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:29.500]  And so they're like, man, we love having you on.
[1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:33.500]  Our ratings go out the roof, but then they get calls and say, don't have him on.
[1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:34.500]  So you really want to get into all this.
[1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:36.500]  I can explain it to you.
[1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:48.500]  Yes, CNN attacked me and said that she didn't commit suicide and that I was basically wrong was the whole part of the piece and showed prisonplanet.com and then played a clip.
[1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:52.500]  Let's talk about another CNN I didn't know about of my show.
[1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:54.500]  They call one day and ask to use it.
[1:12:54.500 --> 1:13:00.500]  They call the next and say, oh, we're not going to have you on Nancy Grace and this other show and this show and that show.
[1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:01.500]  But can we still use the clip?
[1:13:01.500 --> 1:13:03.500]  And I said, yeah, I told you, leave me alone.
[1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:05.500]  Use the club.
[1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:08.500]  And so see, I've just burned about five minutes explaining this.
[1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:10.500]  Let me tell you something.
[1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:14.500]  Patriots tell you you are empowered.
[1:13:14.500 --> 1:13:15.500]  You have an effect.
[1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:16.500]  They work with others.
[1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:19.500]  But I am trying to scare you.
[1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:20.500]  I'm scared.
[1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:21.500]  I mean, I'm concerned.
[1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:27.500]  I am saying, I mean, there's a bully when I'm out on Lake Travis with friends fishing and I see a hazard bully.
[1:13:27.500 --> 1:13:29.500]  Do I go, how dare them try to scare Munger?
[1:13:29.500 --> 1:13:31.500]  No, there's a big submerged rock.
[1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:34.500]  You know, there's a cliff face sticking out.
[1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:37.500]  It's two feet under the water that will rip the bottom of your boat off.
[1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:40.500]  So they got a bully saying hazard.
[1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:42.500]  And so I come on and go, this is serious.
[1:13:42.500 --> 1:13:46.500]  You know, that's why I've woken up more people than anybody else in this movement.
[1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:47.500]  Everybody says it.
[1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:52.500]  Ron Paul, G. Edward Griffin, Jack McClann, they all say it.
[1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:54.500]  So judge a tree by its fruits.
[1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:55.500]  Am I effective?
[1:13:55.500 --> 1:13:56.500]  Yes.
[1:13:56.500 --> 1:13:59.500]  Do I break major stories and work my butt off?
[1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:00.500]  Yes.
[1:14:00.500 --> 1:14:02.500]  Am I trying to build a more effective organization?
[1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:03.500]  Yes.
[1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:04.500]  Am I perfect?
[1:14:04.500 --> 1:14:05.500]  No.
[1:14:05.500 --> 1:14:10.500]  But I mean, I wake up all these people and I tell you you're empowered and I empower all these other groups.
[1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:17.500]  And when you go, I've got a bad feeling when CNN was reporting on you.
[1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:20.500]  Well, yeah, they called up and said, you want money?
[1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:23.500]  They always want to give you a money at 500,000 bucks.
[1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:26.500]  And then they always got to check back and they'll put your website up.
[1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:28.500]  I want my website covered.
[1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:29.500]  You're going to play my clip.
[1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:31.500]  So that's what that was, goofball.
[1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:34.500]  You know, oh my gosh, I'm in league with them.
[1:14:34.500 --> 1:14:39.500]  If I was in league with them, it'd be Alex Jones, the phenomenon, waking America up.
[1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:40.500]  He's a great guy.
[1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:43.500]  He's got millions of listeners.
[1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:47.500]  Instead, it's a nightline calling up wanting to do a huge hit piece on me.
[1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:52.500]  Like they basically did on Scientologist, which I don't like and I'm not affiliated with.
[1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:54.500]  The point is, is it was the same MO, same producers.
[1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:59.500]  I had the guy that did the hit piece on Michael Jackson, did a hit piece for History Channel,
[1:14:59.500 --> 1:15:01.500]  spent millions attacking me.
[1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:04.500]  I mean, folks, let me give you a little cue.
[1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:09.500]  When CNN's saying prison plan, it's wrong and when the guy that did the major piece on Michael Jackson
[1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:14.500]  sicked on me and nightlines begging to interview me for six months straight
[1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:19.500]  and producing some huge hit piece, oh yes, I'm bad.
[1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:23.500]  My God, is it going to take them blowing my head off on the street or planting drugs on me
[1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:26.500]  or IRSing my butt out of existence for you to think,
[1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:30.500]  look, stop sucking your thumb about Alex Jones and whether I'm good or not.
[1:15:30.500 --> 1:15:32.500]  You're good, supposedly.
[1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:33.500]  You go out and do a radio show.
[1:15:33.500 --> 1:15:35.500]  You take action.
[1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:36.500]  What a diversion.
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:37.500]  What a distraction.
[1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:39.500]  What a waste of time.
[1:15:39.500 --> 1:15:40.500]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:40.500 --> 1:15:41.500]  Stay with us.
[1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:42.500]  We'll get into a bunch of news and then your calls.
[1:15:42.500 --> 1:15:43.500]  I got to cover news now.
[1:15:43.500 --> 1:15:44.500]  Stay with us.
[1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:45.500]  It's huge.
[1:15:45.500 --> 1:16:11.500]  It's huge.
[1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:37.500]  It's huge.
[1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:52.500]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:16:52.500 --> 1:16:58.500]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[1:16:58.500 --> 1:16:59.500]  That's right.
[1:16:59.500 --> 1:17:02.500]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[1:17:02.500 --> 1:17:09.500]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:17.500]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:22.500]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:28.500]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:33.500]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[1:17:33.500 --> 1:17:35.500]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:38.500]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[1:17:38.500 --> 1:17:41.500]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:17:41.500 --> 1:17:49.500]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:56.500]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[1:18:56.500 --> 1:19:02.500]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles.
[1:19:02.500 --> 1:19:06.500]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[1:19:06.500 --> 1:19:11.500]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:16.500]  At SchneiderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science,
[1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:20.500]  the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:35.500]  Now you can easily and effectively rid your body of harmful acidic waste with alkaline ionized water.

[1:19:51.500 --> 1:19:54.500]  You are listening to GCN.
[1:19:54.500 --> 1:19:58.500]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:03.500]  Raging for the truth.
[1:20:03.500 --> 1:20:05.500]  Exposing corruption.
[1:20:05.500 --> 1:20:09.500]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:12.500]  He's Alex Jones.
[1:20:12.500 --> 1:20:16.500]  Waging war on corruption, crashing into the lies and disinformation.
[1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:19.500]  I said I wasn't going to take any more calls until I was done with news.
[1:20:19.500 --> 1:20:25.500]  Howard, Robert, Steve, Howard, Tim, Tony, Mark, and others.
[1:20:25.500 --> 1:20:30.500]  Because I've got all this news here in front of me, but when somebody disagrees, I go to the other line and I just can't help it.
[1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:36.500]  On my screen it says, I hate you, you suck, I disagree with everything you say, you lie about everything, nothing you say is true.
[1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:44.500]  Again, we don't screen your calls, but if you want to volunteer some hateful screed for me to know what it's about, we will certainly read that out on air.
[1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:51.500]  And so let's see if the person can contain themselves and not use profanity before we have to delay them out, and it's not delayed on the internet.
[1:20:51.500 --> 1:20:53.500]  We need to do something about that.
[1:20:53.500 --> 1:20:57.500]  We don't want to hurt the ears of the people online there.
[1:20:57.500 --> 1:21:02.500]  Let's go ahead and go to Howard in New York.
[1:21:02.500 --> 1:21:04.500]  Howard, you're on the air, go ahead.
[1:21:04.500 --> 1:21:08.500]  That's the word I said, I disagree with you and I don't like you, I didn't say you suck or anything like that.
[1:21:08.500 --> 1:21:11.500]  Okay, well whatever, that's what they said you said.
[1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:13.500]  You're on the air now, sir, go ahead.
[1:21:13.500 --> 1:21:15.500]  Give me two minutes, I'm talking to you, okay?
[1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:16.500]  Then you can say anything.
[1:21:16.500 --> 1:21:19.500]  I know, you got always that like you got the power and you're setting the ground rules.
[1:21:19.500 --> 1:21:22.500]  Sir, make your point or I'm going to hang up on you.
[1:21:22.500 --> 1:21:26.500]  Okay, I've read your website a few times and I've listened to a few gets you head on.
[1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:33.500]  And I see all these articles you have on your website talking about Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, Ariel Sharon, and the like.
[1:21:33.500 --> 1:21:40.500]  And I feel in my opinion, you know better than George Galilee, no better than Ray McGovern, no better than Mel Gibson.
[1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:42.500]  In my opinion, I think you're anti-Semite.
[1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:46.500]  And I just heard you say that Israel has 400 nuclear weapons.
[1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:47.500]  How do you know that?
[1:21:47.500 --> 1:21:52.500]  And if they did, they're the only civilized country in the Middle East surrounded by a bunch of maniacs.
[1:21:52.500 --> 1:21:54.500]  Hold on, this is all crazy here.
[1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:56.500]  Are you saying I'm lying about Israel having nukes?
[1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:57.500]  Well, how do you know?
[1:21:57.500 --> 1:21:58.500]  Prove that.
[1:21:58.500 --> 1:22:07.500]  Well, Mr. Mornanou and a bunch of other people have come out and Israel has admitted it and a bunch of declassified documents because the media has only lied in the U.S.
[1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:10.500]  and said they didn't have nukes all these years.
[1:22:10.500 --> 1:22:11.500]  But now it's admitted.
[1:22:11.500 --> 1:22:12.500]  I mean, it's admitted, sir.
[1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:14.500]  You're saying I'm lying about that.
[1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:18.500]  Well, I never actually had the article saying that.
[1:22:18.500 --> 1:22:19.500]  Okay, hold on, hold on.
[1:22:19.500 --> 1:22:20.500]  You don't want to put it on hold.
[1:22:20.500 --> 1:22:22.500]  Oops, I actually hung up on him.
[1:22:22.500 --> 1:22:23.500]  Sir, call back in.
[1:22:23.500 --> 1:22:24.500]  We'll keep a line open for you.
[1:22:24.500 --> 1:22:27.500]  I missed the number there and hit the wrong button.
[1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:30.500]  Listen, I can't do this with you.
[1:22:30.500 --> 1:22:33.500]  Okay, I mean, I can't be in this delusional world with you.
[1:22:33.500 --> 1:22:35.500]  I can't do it anymore.
[1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:40.500]  All right, brother, I can't live in an imaginary world anymore.
[1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:42.500]  I won't do it.
[1:22:42.500 --> 1:22:47.500]  See, most Americans think if something's your opinion, that makes it so.
[1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:49.500]  He said, I'd like to see an article.
[1:22:49.500 --> 1:22:51.500]  I'd like to see a proof of that.
[1:22:51.500 --> 1:22:55.500]  They've arrested a bunch of their scientists that worked at these labs.
[1:22:55.500 --> 1:22:58.500]  They've had nukes since the early 1960s.
[1:22:58.500 --> 1:23:00.500]  The United States gave it to them.
[1:23:00.500 --> 1:23:06.500]  They've got, of course, former President Jimmy Carter, and then Israel got mad and said he released classified info.
[1:23:06.500 --> 1:23:07.500]  They said it was true.
[1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:10.500]  A few weeks ago, said, hey, you got 200 and something nukes.
[1:23:10.500 --> 1:23:12.500]  That's how much he knew when he was in office.
[1:23:12.500 --> 1:23:13.500]  It's 400.
[1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:14.500]  The real number is more like 800.
[1:23:14.500 --> 1:23:16.500]  If you want to get technical, it's 800.
[1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:23.500]  But the mainline scholarly amount admitted the last time stuff got leaked in the early 90s was 400.
[1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:25.500]  They got German dolphin subs.
[1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:29.500]  They've got cruise missiles, bombers, everything.
[1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:35.500]  And so I say Israel's got 400 nukes, whether it's 200 or 900, whatever.
[1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:37.500]  They've got hundreds of nuclear weapons.
[1:23:37.500 --> 1:23:46.500]  It's hypocritical to say that Iran's going to get one when the UN and everybody else and our own CIA assessment says they don't have nukes.
[1:23:46.500 --> 1:23:50.500]  To then say, well, they might get one someday, so we want to nuke them.
[1:23:50.500 --> 1:23:58.500]  Hit them with a bunch of strategic nukes, which then, by the way, will add and create isotopes with a ground detonation.
[1:23:58.500 --> 1:24:03.500]  Much dirtier than an atmospheric, because then the atmosphere, it doesn't create a lot of fallout.
[1:24:03.500 --> 1:24:08.500]  The fallout's the combination of the reaction and the surrounding metals and compounds.
[1:24:08.500 --> 1:24:11.500]  You know what a little bit of cobalt will do?
[1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:13.500]  Just a little bit in the ground where that nuke goes off.
[1:24:13.500 --> 1:24:19.500]  I mean, let's say a little bit of cobalt and a machine at that base, and they have, by the way, cobalt and things there.
[1:24:19.500 --> 1:24:24.500]  I mean, just hundreds of different metals create incredibly radioactive isotopes.
[1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:31.500]  And then they want to hit them with hundreds of strategic nukes all over Iran at all their research sites, destroying their entire infrastructure.
[1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:34.500]  That will be thrown into the air and we'll breathe it.
[1:24:34.500 --> 1:24:35.500]  Okay.
[1:24:35.500 --> 1:24:47.500]  So as an American who pays all this tax money to Israel, and I don't like it going to Egypt, Israel, Russia, China, I don't like it going to hundreds of countries.
[1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:49.500]  I'm against all this foreign aid.
[1:24:49.500 --> 1:24:53.500]  And Ron Paul comes out and says, I'm against foreign aid.
[1:24:53.500 --> 1:24:55.500]  I mean, why is it?
[1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:59.500]  Do people say I'm anti-Egyptian because I'm against them getting foreign aid?
[1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:06.500]  I mean, you ought to go look at all the Nazi sites that attack me because, you know, I don't come out and say Jews are the devil.
[1:25:06.500 --> 1:25:20.500]  But at the same time, I don't appreciate, and that's why Israel has lost so much credibility, is calling former presidents and calling anybody that's against attacking Iran in any semi, when, you know, both my grandfathers were in the Army Air Corps.
[1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:23.500]  And one of them, one of them crashed and almost died.
[1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:25.500]  The other was a gunner.
[1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:26.500]  One was a pilot.
[1:25:26.500 --> 1:25:27.500]  One was a gunner.
[1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:30.500]  And he never, until after he died, they didn't even, he just said, oh, I was in the army.
[1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:33.500]  And then we found out he was in B-17s and a gunner going into Germany.
[1:25:33.500 --> 1:25:35.500]  How dare you?
[1:25:35.500 --> 1:25:41.500]  When I almost don't exist because my grandfathers both almost died fighting Hitler.
[1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:44.500]  How dare you?
[1:25:44.500 --> 1:25:49.500]  I mean, now it's basically implied that America is Nazi Germany and America is bad.
[1:25:49.500 --> 1:25:53.500]  And America has got a, and I'll tell you something too.
[1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:58.500]  I don't like the fact that Israel has been caught spying on this country so much.
[1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:01.500]  And I don't like the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu's mother founded the Mossad.
[1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:06.500]  He's known to be a dual citizen and he is known to be Homeland Security head.
[1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:08.500]  He wants to use Israeli companies.
[1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:13.500]  This is Reuters to run domestic checkpoints and train our police to have domestic checkpoints in America.
[1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:15.500]  I like my fourth amendment.
[1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:19.500]  I wouldn't like a Mexican company doing that or a Russian company or an Israeli company.
[1:26:19.500 --> 1:26:24.500]  And it's my right under the first amendment to say that I don't like that.
[1:26:24.500 --> 1:26:30.500]  And how dare you when, when, when, when I almost don't exist, both my grandfathers almost died.
[1:26:30.500 --> 1:26:38.500]  In the defense of this country in the air and then a defense of the Jewish people and the defense against Hitler.
[1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:47.500]  And you call here and you, you, you go to a World War II veteran who fought for this country in the Pacific like Jimmy Carter.
[1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:55.500]  And you say he's an anti-Semite because it's on video Israeli police shooting Palestinian children and laughing.
[1:26:55.500 --> 1:26:56.500]  That's wrong.
[1:26:56.500 --> 1:27:02.500]  And then when you defend that, you then make the entire Israeli uniform disgraced.
[1:27:02.500 --> 1:27:06.500]  Just like when our troops torture people, they disgrace our uniform.
[1:27:06.500 --> 1:27:13.500]  It's people like that disgracing Israel and disgracing this country, not people speaking out against it.
[1:27:13.500 --> 1:27:20.500]  I mean, is this country a politically correct cult or something?
[1:27:20.500 --> 1:27:27.500]  I mean, Ray McGovern was a top CIA analyst for George Bush senior and Ronald Reagan.
[1:27:27.500 --> 1:27:32.500]  He reported before we attacked, there was no WMDs and they falsified the reports.
[1:27:32.500 --> 1:27:33.500]  That's now all come out.
[1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:35.500]  Is Scott McClellan anti-Israel?
[1:27:35.500 --> 1:27:39.500]  I mean, can't we just say we don't want World War III?
[1:27:39.500 --> 1:27:45.500]  The mainstream media is reporting that if they attack Iran for at least a year, we will have $12 a gallon gas.
[1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:48.500]  You know what that'll do to the rest of the economy?
[1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:51.500]  I don't want to have nuclear fallout.
[1:27:51.500 --> 1:27:54.500]  I don't want to kill more Arabs and Central Asians.
[1:27:54.500 --> 1:27:59.500]  I don't want bad things to happen.
[1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:01.500]  This is incredible.
[1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:06.500]  I have my First Amendment right to say I don't want war along with 80% of the American people.
[1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:11.500]  And 80% of the American people know they're not anti-Semitic.
[1:28:11.500 --> 1:28:18.500]  Frankly, I never even think about Israel or Jews or people until the media brings it up and says,
[1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:23.500]  if you don't support New King Iran, you love Hitler.
[1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:26.500]  How dare you?
[1:28:26.500 --> 1:28:33.500]  My very existence was threatened and many of you lost your grandfathers and people fighting Hitler.
[1:28:33.500 --> 1:28:35.500]  And then we get called that.
[1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:37.500]  That is outrageous.
[1:28:37.500 --> 1:28:42.500]  We'll be right back with more news, stuff that actually matters, not little mindless diversions.
[1:28:42.500 --> 1:28:44.500]  They're coming to forcibly inoculate you.

[1:30:49.500 --> 1:30:52.500]  I used to be ashamed of my toenails.
[1:30:52.500 --> 1:30:58.500]  I thought I was destined to wear socks and tennis shoes through the heat of the summer and hide my toes in the sand at the beach.
[1:30:58.500 --> 1:31:01.500]  But then I heard about non-x nail gel.
[1:31:01.500 --> 1:31:06.500]  It tackles the problem of unsightly nails by clearing out the cause of the problem.
[1:31:06.500 --> 1:31:08.500]  Yellowing keratin debris buildup.
[1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:15.500]  With regular use, non-x gel breaks down and removes this debris, so nails look clear.
[1:31:15.500 --> 1:31:21.500]  I confess I was skeptical in the beginning, but I stuck with it, using non-x gel twice daily.
[1:31:21.500 --> 1:31:27.500]  Actually, I was surprised how generously sized the bottle is and how long it lasts.
[1:31:27.500 --> 1:31:33.500]  A while ago, you could look at my nails and, well, glance away, but not anymore.
[1:31:33.500 --> 1:31:40.500]  Now my toenails look better than ever, and I'm wearing sandals again, thanks to a simple natural gel.
[1:31:40.500 --> 1:31:44.500]  If your toenails are an embarrassment, try non-x nail gel.
[1:31:44.500 --> 1:31:49.500]  It's available in the foot care aisle of your drugstore, mass retailer, or super center.
[1:31:49.500 --> 1:31:53.500]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[1:31:53.500 --> 1:31:57.500]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[1:31:57.500 --> 1:32:04.500]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[1:32:04.500 --> 1:32:07.500]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[1:32:07.500 --> 1:32:13.500]  Oxysilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement
[1:32:13.500 --> 1:32:16.500]  making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[1:32:16.500 --> 1:32:21.500]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:24.500]  Oxysilver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[1:32:24.500 --> 1:32:29.500]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds,
[1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:31.500]  flus, cancers, and more.
[1:32:31.500 --> 1:32:37.500]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely, and inexpensively with Oxysilver.
[1:32:37.500 --> 1:32:43.500]  Order your supply now by calling toll-free 1-877-817-9829.
[1:32:43.500 --> 1:32:54.500]  That's 1-877-817-9829. Do it now.
[1:32:54.500 --> 1:33:01.500]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:09.500]  Corruption never had a worse enemy. You're locked into the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:09.500 --> 1:33:14.500]  Today, during the break, I Googled Nuclear Weapons Israel.
[1:33:14.500 --> 1:33:22.500]  Thousands of Reuters, AP, Washington Post, universities, encyclopedias, but they're all anti-Semitic.
[1:33:22.500 --> 1:33:24.500]  They all hate Israel.
[1:33:24.500 --> 1:33:30.500]  So I thought I'd go to Herat's for you, the third largest paper in Israel.
[1:33:30.500 --> 1:33:39.500]  And it goes on to say that, of all places in the world, Jimmy Carter chose a book fair on the banks of the River Y in Wales
[1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:44.500]  as the spot from which he put an official end to Israel's nuclear ambiguity.
[1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:50.500]  One cannot exaggerate the importance of the former American president's statement that Israel has 150 nuclear bombs.
[1:33:50.500 --> 1:33:52.500]  That's back when he was in office, they did.
[1:33:52.500 --> 1:33:57.500]  More than all these estimates and leaks about Israel's nuclear program over the past five decades,
[1:33:57.500 --> 1:34:02.500]  Carter's comments on Sunday gave official admission to Israel's status as a nuclear power.
[1:34:02.500 --> 1:34:05.500]  And it goes into Van Anu and all those, you know, they've arrested.
[1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:14.500]  James Weapons Quarterly, which is the encyclopedia of weapons, says they've got about 800.
[1:34:14.500 --> 1:34:18.500]  Israel's also got race-specific bio weapons that kill certain races.
[1:34:18.500 --> 1:34:23.500]  So does the U.S., so does South Africa, so do the Russians.
[1:34:23.500 --> 1:34:32.500]  That's stuff that kills certain groups of people, and Dick Cheney wrote in Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[1:34:32.500 --> 1:34:41.500]  September 20, 2000, page 46, that they need to legitimize in the media killing certain races of people with bio weapons.
[1:34:41.500 --> 1:34:44.500]  I mean, my gosh, folks, I think it's time to be in reality.
[1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:48.500]  I didn't write that. The vice president did.
[1:34:48.500 --> 1:34:50.500]  And PNAC had their website up for 10 years.
[1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:57.500]  They just took it down last week and made news, but it's been cashed by universities that has saved.
[1:34:57.500 --> 1:35:01.500]  Heaven help us, folks.
[1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:07.500]  You know, I just covered the news here on this show, and that guy said, how do you know? How do you prove it?
[1:35:07.500 --> 1:35:09.500]  Why are you talking about something that's classified?
[1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:11.500]  Like, I'm lying. Hey, they've got weapons.
[1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:16.500]  Or like, if he says I'm not allowed to say they have them, it doesn't.
[1:35:16.500 --> 1:35:20.500]  I mean, this is bizarre.
[1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:22.500]  This is bizarre.
[1:35:22.500 --> 1:35:26.500]  But that's just, I guess, what we've turned into in this country.
[1:35:26.500 --> 1:35:31.500]  I'll never forget a couple of months ago, they had the White House Press Secretary, she's up there.
[1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:38.500]  And they say, is it true that most of the gas price increases are because the dollars have been devalued?
[1:35:38.500 --> 1:35:40.500]  Is it true the dollars have been devalued?
[1:35:40.500 --> 1:35:46.500]  And like, four reporters asked her, we played the clip on the show, I think it was even the Sunday show, they kept saying, is it true?
[1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:48.500]  Is it true the dollars have been devalued? Is it true?
[1:35:48.500 --> 1:35:51.500]  Because the media will never say all the foreign press admits it.
[1:35:51.500 --> 1:35:56.500]  It's a set number on the world market every day and currency market trading.
[1:35:56.500 --> 1:36:00.500]  I mean, it's like asking what the top temperature was in your city a day.
[1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:02.500]  I mean, you can go look it up.
[1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:04.500]  It's like asking the temperature of the ice freezes.
[1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:09.500]  It's like asking, you know, just anything.
[1:36:09.500 --> 1:36:11.500]  It's just absolute fact.
[1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:12.500]  But see, our media doesn't do that.
[1:36:12.500 --> 1:36:14.500]  They go, is it true they've got news?
[1:36:14.500 --> 1:36:15.500]  Can we say it?
[1:36:15.500 --> 1:36:17.500]  We're such a lapdog.
[1:36:17.500 --> 1:36:20.500]  Oh, is it true the dollars been devalued?
[1:36:20.500 --> 1:36:22.500]  And she said, I can't answer that.
[1:36:22.500 --> 1:36:23.500]  I'll be fired if I tell you.
[1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:25.500]  I've been told not to tell you.
[1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:32.500]  And so the media said, well, we can't say whether the dollars been devalued in world currency markets because the White House won't tell us.
[1:36:32.500 --> 1:36:36.500]  That's like saying, White House, how do I zip my pants?
[1:36:36.500 --> 1:36:38.500]  Can you do it for me?
[1:36:38.500 --> 1:36:41.500]  Is this a zipper?
[1:36:41.500 --> 1:36:44.500]  I mean, this is a nation of total zombies.
[1:36:44.500 --> 1:36:46.500]  I can't believe what we've turned into.
[1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:48.500]  But see, used to people didn't watch TV.
[1:36:48.500 --> 1:36:50.500]  They read newspapers four or five hours a day for entertainment.
[1:36:50.500 --> 1:37:04.500]  And even though that had a lot of propaganda in it 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years ago, still, you know, there would be 10, 15 papers in a city the size of New York or four or five in Dallas or five or six in Houston or six or seven in Detroit.
[1:37:04.500 --> 1:37:09.500]  And then they would compete and have different angles and nor you'd find out this paper was the establishment one.
[1:37:09.500 --> 1:37:10.500]  And this one was the muckraking.
[1:37:10.500 --> 1:37:12.500]  And not now.
[1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:18.500]  It's just he said, there's no see the liar.
[1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:24.500]  I bet that color was really mad that I was pointing out our government is Alcada runs Alcada publicly.
[1:37:24.500 --> 1:37:33.500]  You know, maybe I should pull up the White House press release from September last year where they said, yes, we are launching guerrilla groups in Iran four years after we reported it.
[1:37:33.500 --> 1:37:34.500]  And it's already been going on.
[1:37:34.500 --> 1:37:36.500]  And yes, they are killing and bombing.
[1:37:36.500 --> 1:37:42.500]  And they have generals on Fox saying, yeah, we need to blow things up and bomb people on the streets of Tehran.
[1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:43.500]  Who are those people?
[1:37:43.500 --> 1:37:45.500]  They're Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia.
[1:37:45.500 --> 1:37:47.500]  Alcada.
[1:37:47.500 --> 1:37:50.500]  And I'm sorry it's coming out.
[1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:51.500]  You know what?
[1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:53.500]  How about I type into Google?
[1:37:53.500 --> 1:37:55.500]  Israel creates fake terror groups.
[1:37:55.500 --> 1:38:01.500]  And I'll be on Jerusalem post and her rods and UPI and AP, but never made our news.
[1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:11.500]  Never made the big nightly news about Anna Nicole Smith or OJ's new trial or whatever the new ridiculous diversion is.
[1:38:11.500 --> 1:38:13.500]  I mean, is her rods bad?
[1:38:13.500 --> 1:38:21.500]  Should I report that Israel created fake Alcada groups to bomb innocent Jews every time to end the peace process?
[1:38:21.500 --> 1:38:24.500]  I mean, is her rods anti Israel?
[1:38:24.500 --> 1:38:28.500]  No, there's a lot of people in Israel that don't like what's happening.
[1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:32.500]  In fact, more than half in many of the polls, but the military government doesn't care.
[1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:36.500]  And they play this parliamentary game of never letting the people get control.
[1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:40.500]  Now, there's some real Arabs that want to stab and kill and shoot and bomb Israelis.
[1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:43.500]  Yes, is it tribal warfare going on for thousands of years?
[1:38:43.500 --> 1:38:47.500]  I mean, those tribes have been killing each other for 3000 years.
[1:38:47.500 --> 1:38:49.500]  They're all intermarried.
[1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:50.500]  They do their genotype.
[1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:53.500]  It's the same group.
[1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:55.500]  The Arabs and the Jews are killing each other.
[1:38:55.500 --> 1:38:57.500]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:38:57.500 --> 1:39:01.500]  They're all cousins.
[1:39:01.500 --> 1:39:03.500]  Paul's looking at me with a quizzical look.
[1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:07.500]  Well, you didn't know that the Arabs and the Jews are the same people?
[1:39:07.500 --> 1:39:09.500]  Yeah, it's just, yeah.
[1:39:09.500 --> 1:39:13.500]  No, no, no, I mean, I mean, I'm asking, do you have a question?
[1:39:13.500 --> 1:39:14.500]  Yeah, no, no.
[1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:16.500]  See, it goes back to Jacob.
[1:39:16.500 --> 1:39:18.500]  It's in the Old Testament, the Torah.
[1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:19.500]  Probably anti-Semitic to read the Bible.
[1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:20.500]  I know I'm evil.
[1:39:20.500 --> 1:39:21.500]  I'm sorry.
[1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:24.500]  The Bible probably is, you know, and it says they're the same.
[1:39:24.500 --> 1:39:29.500]  You know, Abraham had one wife and she couldn't get pregnant.
[1:39:29.500 --> 1:39:31.500]  And so then he went and took a concubine.
[1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:35.500]  And then they say that's the Arab lineage.
[1:39:35.500 --> 1:39:36.500]  Okay.
[1:39:36.500 --> 1:39:40.500]  And then the...
[1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:42.500]  Well, yes, they did have multiple wives.
[1:39:42.500 --> 1:39:44.500]  And yes, that does come from...
[1:39:44.500 --> 1:39:47.500]  Well, that's even pre-quote Israelite.
[1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:51.500]  But yeah, the whole region forever, people had multiple wives.
[1:39:51.500 --> 1:39:54.500]  That's been phased out in Judaism.
[1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:57.500]  But yes, that's exactly right.
[1:39:57.500 --> 1:39:58.500]  Oh my gosh.
[1:39:58.500 --> 1:39:59.500]  I'm some kind of thought criminal.
[1:39:59.500 --> 1:40:00.500]  It's kind of like idiocracy.
[1:40:00.500 --> 1:40:04.500]  Have you seen that movie where if you can talk, they arrest you?
[1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:06.500]  You know, the guy says, I have rights.
[1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:07.500]  I have freedoms.
[1:40:07.500 --> 1:40:10.500]  And they go, he's talking like a criminal or he's talking like a...
[1:40:10.500 --> 1:40:11.500]  And they come and arrest him.
[1:40:11.500 --> 1:40:12.500]  He's talking fancy.
[1:40:12.500 --> 1:40:13.500]  Taser him.
[1:40:13.500 --> 1:40:20.500]  He knows how to Google and read Harat saying Israel fakes terror attacks.
[1:40:20.500 --> 1:40:22.500]  Oh my gosh, he didn't like Israel.
[1:40:22.500 --> 1:40:26.500]  I'm not allowed to read out of her rots.
[1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:33.500]  I'm bad because I don't want endless war and killing.
[1:40:33.500 --> 1:40:37.500]  You see, because I am for humanity.
[1:40:37.500 --> 1:40:43.500]  I want every African child to not be shot up with AIDS, virus, laden vaccines and die,
[1:40:43.500 --> 1:40:45.500]  which they admit they've done.
[1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:49.500]  I want every Jewish child.
[1:40:49.500 --> 1:40:53.500]  Whether they're Roman Jews or Ashkenazi, I don't care.
[1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:57.500]  I want everybody whether they're German, whether they're from the Sudetenland or
[1:40:57.500 --> 1:40:59.500]  whether they're Alsatian.
[1:40:59.500 --> 1:41:04.500]  I want Mongolian Chinese to have good lives and their children to do well and
[1:41:04.500 --> 1:41:06.500]  to explore space together.
[1:41:06.500 --> 1:41:08.500]  See, I don't stoop to the tribal level.
[1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:09.500]  I'm sorry.
[1:41:09.500 --> 1:41:13.500]  All governments are corrupt and evil because evil people always want control.
[1:41:13.500 --> 1:41:16.500]  And yes, they're evil Germans.
[1:41:16.500 --> 1:41:18.500]  They're evil Chinese.
[1:41:18.500 --> 1:41:19.500]  They're evil British.
[1:41:19.500 --> 1:41:21.500]  They're evil Jews.
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:26.500]  But if you say what some people that Israel ever did wrong or ever did anything bad,
[1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:29.500]  even though their last couple of prime ministers had to step down because of bribery,
[1:41:29.500 --> 1:41:32.500]  well, ours do that too.
[1:41:32.500 --> 1:41:36.500]  The ADL says you're a Hitler lover.
[1:41:36.500 --> 1:41:37.500]  And I'm sorry.
[1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:41.500]  I'm not the Simon Wiesenthal Center in the ADL that have given awards to Arnold
[1:41:41.500 --> 1:41:45.500]  Alo Schwarzenegger who gave out Hitler records, howl Hitler in front of people,
[1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:48.500]  Rolling Stone reported, said he admired Hitler and wanted to be a dictator
[1:41:48.500 --> 1:41:51.500]  and wears Nazi belt buckles on the cover of Time Magazine.
[1:41:51.500 --> 1:41:54.500]  And I frankly don't appreciate the fact that I've protested him
[1:41:54.500 --> 1:41:59.500]  and that I've protested the Klan and other groups and that you have given a Nazi an award.
[1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:02.500]  I think that is something you need to explain.
[1:42:02.500 --> 1:42:04.500]  Very shameful.
[1:42:04.500 --> 1:42:06.500]  Oh boy.
[1:42:06.500 --> 1:42:11.500]  I don't know how I'm going to cover this news that affects everybody and take your calls.
[1:42:11.500 --> 1:42:14.500]  Here it is in front of me.
[1:42:14.500 --> 1:42:20.500]  Worst vaccine bill ever, six compulsory shots for all children.
[1:42:20.500 --> 1:42:24.500]  Instead of having a real thought process, let's just have a chilling effect.
[1:42:24.500 --> 1:42:26.500]  Let's just say you're anti-government.
[1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:30.500]  Kind of like if you're against war, you're supposedly anti-Israel.
[1:42:30.500 --> 1:42:33.500]  It says the government's going to try to force you to take shots, no consent,
[1:42:33.500 --> 1:42:36.500]  and that they'll give your children shots without your consent.
[1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:38.500]  Now, they're already claiming they have this power.
[1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:39.500]  They really don't.
[1:42:39.500 --> 1:42:40.500]  Now they're coming in with their fraud.
[1:42:40.500 --> 1:42:45.500]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, totally packed blitz on the other side.
[1:42:49.500 --> 1:42:52.500]  Are you tired of raised eyebrows and shrugging shoulders?
[1:42:52.500 --> 1:42:55.500]  Hi, I'm director William Lewis.
[1:42:55.500 --> 1:43:01.500]  Have you ever tried to convince your neighbor or loved one that serious problems exist within our own government?
[1:43:01.500 --> 1:43:06.500]  If you said yes, then you know how hard it is to effectively get your message across.
[1:43:06.500 --> 1:43:09.500]  Now, the American people have a new tool in their arsenal.

[1:47:00.500 --> 1:47:05.500]  The birth of a baby should be one of the most exciting moments that a couple will ever experience.
[1:47:05.500 --> 1:47:12.500]  But an aggressive campaign to screen newborn infants turned that moment into a nightmare for one Indianapolis couple.
[1:47:12.500 --> 1:47:16.500]  It's a story that you'll see only on 24-Hour News 8.
[1:47:16.500 --> 1:47:19.500]  This is little Kate Ellis.
[1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:23.500]  She's healthy and normal, but her birth was traumatic for her parents.
[1:47:23.500 --> 1:47:27.500]  It started just minutes after little Kate was born.
[1:47:27.500 --> 1:47:33.500]  A doctor walked in and told her that he was going to have to administer methadone.
[1:47:33.500 --> 1:47:35.500]  Methadone for a newborn baby?
[1:47:35.500 --> 1:47:41.500]  New dad Mike Ellis was shocked and then worried about giving such a powerful drug to his daughter.
[1:47:41.500 --> 1:47:45.500]  I knew methadone. I've heard in the past that that is for people that have had it.
[1:47:45.500 --> 1:47:48.500]  If you go to infowars.com, you can see the whole five minute newscast.
[1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:52.500]  I got so much, I don't have time to cover it all. I should have covered it the first.
[1:47:52.500 --> 1:48:01.500]  But what they do is, coast to coast, in your medical records, if you had wisdom teeth pulled while you were pregnant,
[1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:03.500]  they go ahead and take your kits.
[1:48:03.500 --> 1:48:06.500]  If you were in a car wreck and they put you on drugs, it doesn't matter if you're on them at the time.
[1:48:06.500 --> 1:48:08.500]  They tested her, tested the baby, no drugs.
[1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:12.500]  They said, we don't care between your medical records, we're taking your child.
[1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:18.500]  And they've got quotas, and the cops lie and say they don't have quotas for tickets, but that's come out they do.
[1:48:18.500 --> 1:48:22.500]  These are public quotas, by law, for a certain amount of kids to seize every day.
[1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:29.500]  And anybody who goes to a hospital, they don't tell you that when they take your blood and stuff, that it's run for the police.
[1:48:29.500 --> 1:48:36.500]  And a lot of drugs have false positives and they look for hundreds of different things.
[1:48:36.500 --> 1:48:42.500]  And so a lot of times the false positive, to hear they said no drugs, it just said that she'd taken some cordone,
[1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:47.500]  hydro cordone, when she'd been in a car wreck, early on in pregnancy, and he came in and said,
[1:48:47.500 --> 1:48:48.500]  we're going to give him this drug.
[1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:49.500]  And they said, why?
[1:48:49.500 --> 1:48:50.500]  And they said, we're taking your kid.
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:51.500]  And then, of course, the baby.
[1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.500]  I mean, this is who they are.
[1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:59.500]  You've been trained like domesticated animals to let the enemy just take your children.
[1:48:59.500 --> 1:49:05.500]  Now, you know all the media all over the country lies every year at the start of school and says, it's the law, your child's got to be vaccinated.
[1:49:05.500 --> 1:49:06.500]  It's not the law.
[1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:07.500]  Total lie.
[1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:10.500]  D.C., District of Criminals, tried to pass a law a few years ago.
[1:49:10.500 --> 1:49:11.500]  They couldn't.
[1:49:11.500 --> 1:49:13.500]  Now, the state of New York is trying to do it.
[1:49:13.500 --> 1:49:14.500]  England's trying to do it.
[1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:16.500]  Now, they can't have it both ways.
[1:49:16.500 --> 1:49:17.500]  I know you believe they're lying.
[1:49:17.500 --> 1:49:18.500]  Most of you, that's a law.
[1:49:18.500 --> 1:49:19.500]  You've got to take shots.
[1:49:19.500 --> 1:49:20.500]  There isn't.
[1:49:20.500 --> 1:49:22.500]  Well, then why would they need a law if there is no law?
[1:49:22.500 --> 1:49:24.500]  You see, there is no law.
[1:49:24.500 --> 1:49:28.500]  They just kick you out of school and say, you're truant, and then they come after you for that.
[1:49:28.500 --> 1:49:29.500]  It's a trick.
[1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:30.500]  But there's no law.
[1:49:30.500 --> 1:49:34.500]  You've got to have shots to be in school so they commit a crime by kicking you out.
[1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:36.500]  D story up on info wars.net.
[1:49:36.500 --> 1:49:42.500]  That's linked to all of these mainstream news articles up on info wars.net.
[1:49:42.500 --> 1:49:43.500]  Top story.
[1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:47.500]  Worst vaccine bill ever six compulsory shots for all children.
[1:49:47.500 --> 1:49:51.500]  Activist group calls for defense of right to exemption in New York state.
[1:49:51.500 --> 1:50:03.500]  Appending New York state assembly bill dubbed the worst vaccine bill ever by one activist group would see all vaccine recommended by the center for disease control and prevention made mandatory for all children, including infants and toddlers.
[1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:04.500]  Assembly bill 10942.
[1:50:04.500 --> 1:50:06.500]  So this is a forced medical procedure.
[1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:09.500]  And of course the doors open then introduced at the.
[1:50:09.500 --> 1:50:10.500]  And this all started with eugenics.
[1:50:10.500 --> 1:50:12.500]  They used to sterilize you here without it.
[1:50:12.500 --> 1:50:14.500]  But that got thrown out decades ago.
[1:50:14.500 --> 1:50:24.500]  Introduced at the request of Richard Danes, the commissioner of New York state health department calls for changes to the law in order to make recommended inoculation compulsory in order for children to attend school.
[1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:30.500]  See, when the con was working of lying and saying it was the law, I have a state attorney on for Maryland a few months ago.
[1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:35.500]  They had 500 kids lined up in St. George County crying dogs barking at him getting shots outside of courthouse.
[1:50:35.500 --> 1:50:36.500]  And I had him on.
[1:50:36.500 --> 1:50:37.500]  I said, but that wasn't a lot.
[1:50:37.500 --> 1:50:41.500]  He said, yeah, but it's best for them to, you know, take their shots and do it.
[1:50:41.500 --> 1:50:44.500]  But I said there it's, but they all thought it was the law.
[1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:47.500]  And he goes, yeah, no, I don't vaccinate my kids started laughing.
[1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:48.500]  It's real funny.
[1:50:48.500 --> 1:50:50.500]  So funny.
[1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:52.500]  So funny.
[1:50:52.500 --> 1:50:56.500]  Even if your for the shots is lying good.
[1:50:56.500 --> 1:51:00.500]  The bill would also permit the administration of vaccines for simply transmitted infections.
[1:51:00.500 --> 1:51:04.500]  And again, the human papilloma shot Gardasil doesn't protect you from it.
[1:51:04.500 --> 1:51:06.500]  They admit go to Gardasil's website.
[1:51:06.500 --> 1:51:08.500]  It says doesn't protect you from the cancer virus.
[1:51:08.500 --> 1:51:14.500]  But if you already have it is about half the population does, then it does give you cancer, a 45% increase.
[1:51:14.500 --> 1:51:16.500]  But again, you won't believe me.
[1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:18.500]  You won't go read Gardasil's own website.
[1:51:18.500 --> 1:51:19.500]  Listen to this.
[1:51:19.500 --> 1:51:20.500]  This is hundreds.
[1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:25.500]  There's over 50 plus shots that they are going to force you to do the groups press release highlights.
[1:51:25.500 --> 1:51:26.500]  The key points of the bill.
[1:51:26.500 --> 1:51:27.500]  And I've read the bill.
[1:51:27.500 --> 1:51:36.500]  Our says elected New York representatives would no longer determine the mandatory schedule of vaccines to attend school decisions made by the federal advisory committee on immunization practice would automatically become mandatory.
[1:51:36.500 --> 1:51:44.500]  All children infants and toddlers included in New York would be required to get all vaccines recommended by the ACIP, whether you go to public school or not.
[1:51:44.500 --> 1:51:48.500]  All children in New York of age 18 would be required to get annual flu shots.
[1:51:48.500 --> 1:51:49.500]  Good God.
[1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:52.500]  All girls in New York will be required to get a human papilloma virus shot.
[1:51:52.500 --> 1:51:54.500]  See, this is going to be the tyranny.
[1:51:54.500 --> 1:51:57.500]  The whole new older system is going to be SWAT teams coming with it.
[1:51:57.500 --> 1:52:00.500]  Notice the cops all over now without warrants or pulling you over taking blood.
[1:52:00.500 --> 1:52:02.500]  It's about getting past that comfort zone.
[1:52:02.500 --> 1:52:05.500]  The cops don't know why they're doing it, but I read the federal documents.
[1:52:05.500 --> 1:52:12.500]  It's the psychology of getting in your face, making you do all this of getting in that comfort zone of violating that fourth amendment.
[1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:16.500]  All junior high school children and college students will be required to get meningitis shots.
[1:52:16.500 --> 1:52:17.500]  Very dangerous.
[1:52:17.500 --> 1:52:22.500]  Doctors will be required to issue certificates for every shot given and parents will be required to maintain the records.
[1:52:22.500 --> 1:52:27.500]  That's a digital servitude violation of one of the amendments and provide them to school and other authorities.
[1:52:27.500 --> 1:52:29.500]  And it just goes on, folks.
[1:52:29.500 --> 1:52:30.500]  You go read the bill.
[1:52:30.500 --> 1:52:31.500]  This is all over the country.
[1:52:31.500 --> 1:52:35.500]  They're trying to do this in the next legislative session of Texas.
[1:52:35.500 --> 1:52:42.500]  Now, all major vaccines for 50 years have been found to have cancer viruses in them.
[1:52:42.500 --> 1:52:45.500]  Cancer has gone from 1 in 33 to 1 in 3.
[1:52:45.500 --> 1:52:48.500]  And I've had Dr. Sock play clips of him.
[1:52:48.500 --> 1:52:53.500]  The inventor of the polio shot admitting hundreds of millions of Americans were given a cancer virus.
[1:52:53.500 --> 1:52:55.500]  Millions died of cancer from it.
[1:52:55.500 --> 1:52:57.500]  But it didn't stop there.
[1:52:57.500 --> 1:52:59.500]  And this is eugenics.
[1:52:59.500 --> 1:53:00.500]  This is done by design.
[1:53:00.500 --> 1:53:01.500]  The doctors don't know.
[1:53:01.500 --> 1:53:02.500]  It's compartmentalized.
[1:53:02.500 --> 1:53:04.500]  I have all the government documents.
[1:53:04.500 --> 1:53:06.500]  And they're coming.
[1:53:06.500 --> 1:53:07.500]  So you were going along with it.
[1:53:07.500 --> 1:53:09.500]  90-plus percent of you now.
[1:53:09.500 --> 1:53:11.500]  Like they have a cover on Time Magazine.
[1:53:11.500 --> 1:53:14.500]  If we don't inoculate, everyone diseases will spread.
[1:53:14.500 --> 1:53:25.500]  But wait a minute, if the shot protects you idiots that take it, then why would you need us to take it who aren't?
[1:53:25.500 --> 1:53:27.500]  See, that's another lie.
[1:53:27.500 --> 1:53:29.500]  They talk to you like your kids.
[1:53:29.500 --> 1:53:34.500]  Oh, if you haven't had the vaccine, then, you know, that will spread it to people that have.
[1:53:34.500 --> 1:53:36.500]  But I thought the vaccine protects you.
[1:53:36.500 --> 1:53:38.500]  Do you know what's in these vaccines?
[1:53:38.500 --> 1:53:41.500]  Do you know they ordered 14 million first responders in 2002?
[1:53:41.500 --> 1:53:46.500]  Just take smallpox and only 4,000 dead and 100 plus died.
[1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:50.500]  And so the other cops, firemen, emergency workers all refused it.
[1:53:50.500 --> 1:53:55.500]  So this is going to be pretty cute because they've now done emergency training for forced inoculation admittedly.
[1:53:55.500 --> 1:54:00.500]  They've done, they've got 26,000 preachers telling their flocks under federal payments secretly.
[1:54:00.500 --> 1:54:02.500]  They're telling the flocks publicly, but it's secret.
[1:54:02.500 --> 1:54:07.500]  And I broke that here before it came out in the mainstream news to tell them to take their shots and go to camps.
[1:54:07.500 --> 1:54:10.500]  But the cops, given the shots, won't take it.
[1:54:10.500 --> 1:54:14.500]  Oh, yeah, baby, we're talking hardcore.
[1:54:14.500 --> 1:54:16.500]  Roll up your sleeve.
[1:54:16.500 --> 1:54:18.500]  Hitler was funded by this country.
[1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:21.500]  And he wanted to do all this through the shots as well.
[1:54:21.500 --> 1:54:25.500]  We got calls from Thailand, Germany, Indiana, Oregon, everywhere.
[1:54:25.500 --> 1:54:27.500]  You know, I'm going to rampage through your calls.
[1:54:27.500 --> 1:54:29.500]  Each caller gets about a minute.
[1:54:29.500 --> 1:54:32.500]  Folks, government didn't used to always be like this.
[1:54:32.500 --> 1:54:34.500]  Government isn't your God.
[1:54:34.500 --> 1:54:36.500]  They can't be your nanny and make you take shots.
[1:54:36.500 --> 1:54:37.500]  What's next?
[1:54:37.500 --> 1:54:40.500]  If you're going to socialize healthcare, they're going to tell you what you can eat.
[1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:41.500]  Barack Obama's already said that.
[1:54:41.500 --> 1:54:44.500]  Tracking with your carbon footprint, you'll pay extra for meat they're admitting.
[1:54:44.500 --> 1:54:46.500]  Tracking every purchase you make.
[1:54:46.500 --> 1:54:47.500]  I told you that 10 years ago.
[1:54:47.500 --> 1:54:48.500]  Now it's been announced.
[1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:49.500]  England's trying to pass it.
[1:54:49.500 --> 1:54:51.500]  I know what I'm talking about.
[1:54:51.500 --> 1:54:53.500]  I figured it out.
[1:54:53.500 --> 1:54:55.500]  We're under attack.
[1:54:55.500 --> 1:54:56.500]  We're all in great danger.
[1:54:56.500 --> 1:54:58.500]  And most people are compartmentalized and can't see it.
[1:54:58.500 --> 1:55:00.500]  They call her from Thailand.
[1:55:00.500 --> 1:55:02.500]  Tim in Thailand, you're on the air.
[1:55:02.500 --> 1:55:03.500]  Go ahead.
[1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:05.500]  Howard in Thailand, go ahead.
[1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:06.500]  What?
[1:55:06.500 --> 1:55:07.500]  Go ahead, Howard.
[1:55:07.500 --> 1:55:08.500]  You're on the air from Thailand.
[1:55:08.500 --> 1:55:09.500]  Yeah.
[1:55:09.500 --> 1:55:11.500]  Actually, I'm from Philadelphia originally.
[1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:12.500]  I've been here two years.
[1:55:12.500 --> 1:55:13.500]  Okay.
[1:55:13.500 --> 1:55:14.500]  Fine.
[1:55:14.500 --> 1:55:15.500]  You're in Thailand.
[1:55:15.500 --> 1:55:16.500]  Are you in Thailand?
[1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:17.500]  Yes.
[1:55:17.500 --> 1:55:18.500]  My board says Thailand.
[1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:19.500]  Go ahead.
[1:55:19.500 --> 1:55:20.500]  Here's my question.
[1:55:20.500 --> 1:55:22.500]  Building number seven.
[1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:27.500]  What are the prevailing theories as to why they brought that down with a controlled demolition?
[1:55:27.500 --> 1:55:30.500]  We know why they did the Twin Towers.
[1:55:30.500 --> 1:55:32.500]  Why did they do building seven?
[1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:33.500]  CIA, FBI.
[1:55:33.500 --> 1:55:36.500]  The entire building was filled with spooks.
[1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:38.500]  Every intelligence agency under the sun.
[1:55:38.500 --> 1:55:39.500]  There's 16 intelligence agencies.
[1:55:39.500 --> 1:55:41.500]  All 16 were in the building.
[1:55:41.500 --> 1:55:44.500]  Then defense intelligence, army intelligence, everything.
[1:55:44.500 --> 1:55:46.500]  We know they have the city command bunker.
[1:55:46.500 --> 1:55:50.500]  We believe they ran the attacks out of that building and then blew up the evidence.
[1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:55.500]  We believe they were probably going to fly 93 into the White House or into building seven.
[1:55:55.500 --> 1:56:02.500]  And when the flight got shot down by the happy hooligans out of North Dakota who refused stand down order and shot it down with two AIM-9 sidewiders.
[1:56:02.500 --> 1:56:05.500]  I have that from one top general and from pilots.
[1:56:05.500 --> 1:56:08.500]  This is vitally dangerous info, by the way, folks.
[1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:13.500]  But they had to then go ahead and blow it.
[1:56:13.500 --> 1:56:23.500]  I've been curious about that because I looked at the various angles of the building and it wouldn't be that easy to hit with a plane.
[1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:25.500]  There's not that much of it there.
[1:56:25.500 --> 1:56:32.500]  Well, when you're doing something about fly-by-wire, they can fly those planes and hit an X if they want.
[1:56:32.500 --> 1:56:34.500]  If I got 30 seconds, let me tell you something.
[1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:37.500]  I'm a pilot. I'm a private pilot.
[1:56:37.500 --> 1:56:39.500]  On the day of 9-11, I got a friend called me up.
[1:56:39.500 --> 1:56:41.500]  He said, wake up, turn on your TV.
[1:56:41.500 --> 1:56:52.500]  The first thing I said to him when I saw the second plane hit was there is no way that anybody without real skill flew those airplanes.
[1:56:52.500 --> 1:56:58.500]  I've interviewed combat vets, the former head of the Star Wars program, astronauts who were also top pilots.
[1:56:58.500 --> 1:57:04.500]  They said that only about half the time could they execute what happened at the towers.
[1:57:04.500 --> 1:57:08.500]  They said the Pentagon, maybe Chuck Yeager could have done it.
[1:57:08.500 --> 1:57:10.500]  Maybe Chuck Yeager.
[1:57:10.500 --> 1:57:12.500]  That's a big maybe.
[1:57:12.500 --> 1:57:13.500]  Maybe Chuck Yeager.
[1:57:13.500 --> 1:57:14.500]  I appreciate your call.
[1:57:14.500 --> 1:57:15.500]  We're out of time.
[1:57:15.500 --> 1:57:17.500]  Let's take a quick one here from Germany.
[1:57:17.500 --> 1:57:19.500]  Take us out of here, Sam, from Deutschland.
[1:57:19.500 --> 1:57:20.500]  Sorry to the others.
[1:57:20.500 --> 1:57:22.500]  Hit me fast.
[1:57:22.500 --> 1:57:23.500]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[1:57:23.500 --> 1:57:28.500]  Hey, Alex, first of all, I was going to call up and say, man, that was a funny comment on the Anti-Semite deal.
[1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:30.500]  That's a typical answer, right?
[1:57:30.500 --> 1:57:33.500]  If you don't go along with the program, you're anti-Semite.
[1:57:33.500 --> 1:57:35.500]  Listen, we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:57:35.500 --> 1:57:36.500]  Out of time. See you back tomorrow.
[1:57:36.500 --> 1:57:37.500]  Back next Sunday.
[1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:39.500]  God bless you all and FullWars.com.
[1:57:39.500 --> 1:57:40.500]  It's the place to be.
[1:57:40.500 --> 1:57:41.500]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:57:41.500 --> 1:57:44.500]  As you know, GCN is a huge supporter of Ron Paul and Holly Stansford.
[1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:52.500]  That's why, for a limited time, I have personally set aside commercial inventory-long advertisers the chance to show their personal support for Ron Paul while promoting their products.
[1:57:52.500 --> 1:58:01.500]  If you would like to voice your support for Ron Paul's march to the White House and have thought about advertising on GCN, give us a call at 877-996-4327.
[1:58:01.500 --> 1:58:10.500]  That's 877-996-4327 or go to GCNLive.com today and click on the Support Ron Paul link on our homepage.
[1:58:10.500 --> 1:58:14.500]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[1:58:14.500 --> 1:58:16.500]  Mine found it in Precious Metals.
[1:58:16.500 --> 1:58:20.500]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:27.500]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[1:58:27.500 --> 1:58:30.500]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[1:58:30.500 --> 1:58:34.500]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:58:34.500 --> 1:58:40.500]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[1:58:40.500 --> 1:58:48.500]  On September 11, 2001, the New World Order hijacked our government and began the process of trying to destroy the United States of America.
[1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:53.500]  If we, the American citizens, do not intervene immediately, they will succeed.
[1:58:53.500 --> 1:58:56.500]  It is time we stand together now and make our voice heard.
