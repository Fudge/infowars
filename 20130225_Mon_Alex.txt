[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:25.920]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.920 --> 00:29.880]  Congressman Ron Paul is going to be calling in sometime in the second half hour of this
[00:29.880 --> 00:36.480]  broadcast today to get into the accelerating debt bubble and how bad it's going to get
[00:36.480 --> 00:42.760]  and some other breaking key intel. So former Congressman Ron Paul, I have to get used to
[00:42.760 --> 00:47.240]  saying that, is joining us, coming up later in the hour.
[00:47.240 --> 00:53.720]  And then Mike Adams is going to be in studio with us today. And in case you missed it,
[00:53.720 --> 01:00.120]  we're going to probably air the first 5, 10 minutes of one of the most prominent Second
[01:00.120 --> 01:02.960]  Amendment advocates out there, you know who that is.
[01:02.960 --> 01:10.840]  Ted Nugent, who I know lives north of Austin on a large ranch. He's been on the show many
[01:10.840 --> 01:15.080]  times over the last 15 years, but hadn't been on in about a year. He called into the show
[01:15.080 --> 01:23.180]  and it was a powerful radio because he wasn't in his promotions mode when he's doing five
[01:23.180 --> 01:24.180]  interviews a day.
[01:24.180 --> 01:29.520]  A lot of people like that have a system where they do interviews in bulk a few times a year,
[01:29.520 --> 01:33.080]  and then that's it. And when they're not doing interviews, they're not doing them. And so
[01:33.080 --> 01:37.640]  when you get interviews with folks like that, and they're kind of on the circuit, you're
[01:37.640 --> 01:43.400]  just getting like a recording. That is not what happened yesterday, and we had some really
[01:43.400 --> 01:46.440]  good talks off air.
[01:46.440 --> 01:53.280]  And he didn't say it was off record, but it'll just remain off record. But looks like I may
[01:53.280 --> 01:58.360]  drive up to interview him in the next month or so before he goes back on tour, or get
[01:58.360 --> 02:05.600]  him in studio, who knows. But in fact, guys, remind me, I'm not name dropping here, I already
[02:05.600 --> 02:09.880]  had his info before, but I never had a cell phone.
[02:09.880 --> 02:12.520]  Where's Ted's cell phone that I had written down here? I left it in there yesterday, I
[02:12.520 --> 02:21.960]  was supposed to call him last night. All right, I just forgot I was, so that's another problem,
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.200]  I'm just completely overwhelmed, literally. It's getting to the point where I don't even
[02:26.200 --> 02:28.080]  know what's going on anymore.
[02:28.080 --> 02:32.360]  Is that it? Okay, good, thank you, thank you. Anyways, I was supposed to, and side issue,
[02:32.360 --> 02:36.040]  ladies and gentlemen, I get in here, I get on air, and then my brain kind of clicks on,
[02:36.040 --> 02:39.960]  I'm like, whoa. Well, you know how I tell stories, I start talking about something and
[02:39.960 --> 02:45.480]  I just kind of start regurgitating whatever's on the top of my mind concerning that.
[02:45.480 --> 02:51.640]  But pretty amazing stuff I talked about with Ted Nugent off air. So we'll see about getting
[02:51.640 --> 02:57.240]  him on air with us in a face-to-face interview, or at least over the phone. But wow, a lot
[02:57.240 --> 03:05.400]  of stuff going on in the world today. We're working on a very big news story that will
[03:05.400 --> 03:12.520]  damage the establishment media big time. I'll just leave it at that. It's top level A-plus
[03:12.520 --> 03:17.640]  scandal, five-star scandal.
[03:17.640 --> 03:24.520]  But there's lots of cold feet stuff going on, and so I'm not worried about it really.
[03:24.520 --> 03:30.040]  If God wants this information to come out, it will, and if God doesn't want this information
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.960]  to come out, it won't. And I'm the type of person that will release it if I'm authorized
[03:35.960 --> 03:46.000]  to, it's confirmed. But if I'm not authorized to, then I'm not gonna even push the people
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.560]  to cover it.
[03:47.560 --> 03:54.640]  And it's the kind of thing like, I take a risk releasing stories like this. So it's
[03:54.640 --> 04:03.000]  kinda like, okay, I got the huevos to release this if it falls in my lap. It's not any scandal
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.140]  stuff with hookers or anything, so there's no need for a hit team to come kill us. Plus
[04:07.140 --> 04:09.920]  the government's listening to all the phones, they already know.
[04:09.920 --> 04:16.640]  People that have cold feet, there's really no need to, cuz the only thing you gotta have
[04:16.640 --> 04:22.540]  cold feet about is the fact that you're sitting on top stuff like that. But it deals with
[04:22.540 --> 04:33.360]  media things. I mean, it'll be a big news story, just to say the least, if it ends up
[04:33.360 --> 04:34.360]  coming out.
[04:34.360 --> 04:40.260]  Okay, I'm gonna reset, refocus, and come back. It's a gigantic news day. And speaking of
[04:40.260 --> 04:45.080]  big news, there's some other big news that's gonna be breaking tomorrow. Michael Savage
[04:45.080 --> 04:50.200]  is also joining us tomorrow, but that's a separate issue. And it's just things are all
[04:50.200 --> 04:55.280]  accelerating. But they're accelerating on so many other fronts as well. They call it
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.080]  a quickening. We'll be right back.
[05:00.080 --> 05:05.080]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[05:05.080 --> 05:09.800]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[05:09.800 --> 05:14.040]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[05:14.040 --> 05:19.420]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[05:19.420 --> 05:24.520]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[05:24.520 --> 05:30.280]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[05:30.280 --> 05:35.000]  Younggevity. The Younggevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.640]  need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've

[07:05.840 --> 07:11.840]  system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve

[08:02.800 --> 08:07.520]  There's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics
[08:07.520 --> 08:30.240]  in different parts of the world. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:30.240 --> 08:46.160]  Well, my friends, it's another Monday, the 25th day of February 2013. Before we know it,
[08:46.160 --> 08:52.080]  2013 will be a memory. And the Second Amendment and our Republic and the dollar and our whole
[08:52.080 --> 08:58.480]  future if we don't get awake and involved right now. Okay, folks, we've got an unbelievably
[08:58.480 --> 09:03.760]  jam-packed broadcast today. Ron Paul's coming on in about 30 minutes. He'll be joining us,
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.960]  Congressman Ron Paul, former Congressman Ron Paul about the economy and a lot more.
[09:10.000 --> 09:18.880]  So that is coming up with really the Grand Poobah, the libertarian constitutional movement.
[09:18.880 --> 09:24.160]  Ron Paul needs no introduction and then Mike Adams will be breaking a whole bunch of important
[09:24.160 --> 09:36.080]  health news with organics and not just the horse meat in the beef food chain. But also,
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.720]  we're gonna be getting into the things you've really got to worry about, including not just
[09:40.720 --> 09:47.440]  fake fish or fish being substituted, but some really bizarre stuff on that front.
[09:48.480 --> 09:52.640]  I've not covered what's happening with the Vatican enough and I do need to speak to that.
[09:52.640 --> 10:00.320]  Another cardinal is resigning, Cardinal Keith O'Brien reportedly because of a string of
[10:00.320 --> 10:08.320]  boyfriends. And if it isn't true, why is he resigning, ladies and gentlemen? Why is
[10:08.320 --> 10:14.960]  Pope Benedict Ratzinger stepping down? The point here is though is that these scandals have
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.720]  been under the surface forever. Why is this all surfacing now? Well, what did I tell you
[10:20.720 --> 10:29.040]  months ago? They're only bringing out the Seville stuff with the BBC and the Satanism
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.400]  and the necrophilia and the torturing kids and the royal family to blackmail the royal
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.040]  family and the British establishment. The system could bring it down right now.
[10:39.920 --> 10:43.440]  The globalist, that's the mega banks, are blackmailing the Vatican right now.
[10:43.440 --> 10:50.400]  This is when you get down to the final end game in global government, is when they start
[10:50.400 --> 10:55.120]  knocking each other off because there's been a sharing of power between the major players.
[10:57.680 --> 11:05.840]  And it is really coming to a head right now. Major globalist private intelligence infiltration
[11:05.840 --> 11:12.960]  of the Vatican, of the British royal family. And it's all being orchestrated in a way that
[11:12.960 --> 11:21.920]  orchestrated by a handful of ultra mega banks who control the entire globe basically at this point
[11:21.920 --> 11:26.000]  and are mopping up a few countries that are left. Then they're gonna mop up free speech,
[11:26.000 --> 11:32.080]  mop up the family, mop up your bank account and bankrupt you as a total economic domination.
[11:32.080 --> 11:37.200]  And then pose as saviors, collectivizing everything and putting you on welfare.
[11:37.200 --> 11:42.240]  They're now talking about going over 50 million Americans on food stamps and food stamps for
[11:42.240 --> 11:49.040]  people's pets. And so everything will be paid for as long as you submit and take the vaccines and
[11:49.600 --> 11:54.160]  don't have children. That is gonna be part of the larger program.
[11:54.160 --> 11:57.440]  And those of us that don't just wanna be complete government slaves
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.400]  are going to be called terrorist. Now, this is a pretty nightmare program of the globalist,
[12:04.400 --> 12:15.200]  but it can be stopped if we speak out and realize the plan. But if we keep dialing into mainstream
[12:15.200 --> 12:21.920]  television and mainstream politics, that only gives you a tiny sliver of the larger spectrum.
[12:23.520 --> 12:28.720]  We will be blind, we will be rudderless, we will be thrown upon the rocks and crushed a little
[12:28.720 --> 12:36.400]  bitty pieces societally. It is a very cold blooded program, a scientific blueprint takeover. But
[12:36.400 --> 12:43.120]  knowing the blueprint and knowing how horrible it is for the general public is a way to trigger our
[12:43.120 --> 12:50.080]  survival instinct and to get humanity firing in the right direction against tyranny.
[12:50.080 --> 12:56.080]  That's why they try to sell giving up, being nihilistic, not caring, being into death,
[12:56.080 --> 13:00.480]  being into being a slave, while you still have plenty of food and water and entertainment.
[13:02.000 --> 13:07.120]  These people thinking death and all this is sexy and being slaves and being humiliated and being
[13:07.120 --> 13:13.520]  tortured is cool because it's cutting edge and because they don't care. They haven't really
[13:13.520 --> 13:23.920]  experienced it yet. So it is a fancy that has been sold to them that they think they like,
[13:23.920 --> 13:29.600]  but not a real fancy. Because if you really fancy something, you need to have experienced
[13:29.600 --> 13:39.200]  it and actually like it. Like if you think you'd fancy having a dog when you're 17 and move out of
[13:39.200 --> 13:44.400]  home and you put a big dog in a small apartment, it chews everything up and urinates all over the
[13:44.400 --> 13:50.400]  rug and everything and choose holes in the walls and ruins your life. And then you just dump the
[13:50.400 --> 13:57.840]  dog or give it to the pound. So you aren't a real dog fancier. You didn't do what it took to
[13:57.840 --> 14:02.480]  actually train the dog, don't care about the dog, take the dog around with you. You don't actually
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.560]  like a dog. You weren't a true dog fancier. And those of you that fancy tyranny and you
[14:08.560 --> 14:15.600]  think it's powerful and it's a dark, mysterious flame that you are approaching, I will assure
[14:15.600 --> 14:24.000]  99.9% of you who are laughing right now and think all this evil is funny, you will wish later you'd
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.400]  done something. Just denying it's happening or saying you don't care, saying so what,
[14:30.400 --> 14:39.360]  humanity is a disease, let it happen. You are saying that from a position of someone that has not
[14:39.360 --> 14:48.080]  been in that lake, who has not swam, swum in its waters. You say you're a veteran of evil.
[14:48.960 --> 14:55.120]  You say you're a veteran of being cool and narcissistic in your own mind. But all that
[14:55.120 --> 15:05.600]  is is a coward's subconscious Pavlovian mass Stockholm learned helplessness response that
[15:05.600 --> 15:12.800]  deep down your subconscious is telling you you're in mortal peril. But you don't respect yourself
[15:12.800 --> 15:19.440]  enough to admit to yourself how much peril you and our entire species is in, all of us.
[15:20.320 --> 15:28.720]  And so you then mock what your greater mind is warning you about. That is your coward response.
[15:29.280 --> 15:33.840]  It's no big deal. It's not a problem. Yes, it is a problem. And yes, it's real. And yes,
[15:33.840 --> 15:38.080]  it is a problem. And yes, it's real. And those of you that work for the system in your little
[15:38.080 --> 15:44.000]  offices and your little suits and your black ties and your national security clearance crud
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.280]  live in the biggest propagandized echo chambers out there.
[15:49.920 --> 15:54.720]  And you who see nothing, who say nothing, who hear nothing,
[15:54.720 --> 16:03.440]  you are fools and you're on a fool's errand. You're not an assassin. You're a
[16:05.280 --> 16:07.920]  errand boy sitting by the grocer to collect a debt.
[16:16.320 --> 16:18.880]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let me try to give you some of the headlines here. I had
[16:18.880 --> 16:22.800]  a Ron Paul coming on. And then Mike Adamson studio with breaking news. We'll have open
[16:22.800 --> 16:27.600]  phones the next hour if I'm able to control myself and cover the news.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.040]  Let me just give you some of the latest stuff that broke in the top stories here.
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.280]  There is the new Watson article just went live. We print it for me.
[16:39.840 --> 16:44.240]  I hadn't talked about it yet, but it's big breaking news, really big.
[16:46.880 --> 16:48.320]  It ties into this article.
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.000]  Lobbyist demands approval for lethal drones within the United States.
[16:53.040 --> 16:56.960]  Apple wide admits UAVs have been used for indiscriminate killings.
[16:58.560 --> 17:04.080]  And that's one of the main lobbyists for the drone outfit. And here is the breaking news.
[17:04.080 --> 17:10.160]  You got to hit refresh on prison planet.com and infowars.com to get this to get past our
[17:10.160 --> 17:13.600]  caching system. It takes about 15 minutes for articles to show up sometimes.
[17:13.600 --> 17:20.640]  Former Obama press secretary was ordered to act as if drone program did not exist.
[17:21.680 --> 17:26.640]  The first rule of the drone program is that you do not talk about the drone program.
[17:26.640 --> 17:34.000]  And no, that's Steve Watson's article on drones. Although the Paul Watson one has not broken yet.
[17:34.640 --> 17:38.160]  Okay, I told him watch out for Watson's drone article.
[17:38.160 --> 17:44.960]  And so you can't blame them for bringing me one that Steve just did. They're such prolific, right?
[17:44.960 --> 17:51.680]  And that isn't a big breaking news. I'll tell you what it is. And it should be out in the next
[17:53.120 --> 18:03.360]  15, 20 minutes or so. Homeland Security has funded a new special drone specifically to hunt
[18:03.360 --> 18:09.920]  down gun owners. You can't make this up. We have the actual training video.
[18:12.960 --> 18:19.280]  I'm laughing because it's just so out of control. I mean, we're in a science fiction movie.
[18:19.920 --> 18:26.320]  They're poisoning the food and water. I've got articles here about China's cancer cities,
[18:26.320 --> 18:31.600]  as they're called. Because their cancers are up 3, 4, 5,000% depending on which type.
[18:31.600 --> 18:40.400]  So are ours. It's just such a joke when people are like, the government's there to protect us.
[18:40.400 --> 18:47.120]  It's not that bad, Alex. They're not terrorists, you'd be dead. They haven't killed me yet because
[18:47.120 --> 18:52.880]  they believe it'll interfere in their computer simulation with their over the horizon Google
[18:52.880 --> 18:59.440]  crystal ball junk. It would mess up the simulation because I've been around for so long
[18:59.440 --> 19:03.520]  that it would validate everything I've said. And they know I've already covered every issue
[19:03.520 --> 19:07.680]  under the sun. And so they don't want that big trigger event yet.
[19:09.040 --> 19:12.000]  Don't worry, they plan on killing me later, make no mistake.
[19:14.160 --> 19:21.600]  Yes, this is a death grip battle. This is a fight to the death, folks. I hope you realize
[19:21.600 --> 19:26.640]  that out there. This is not a game. This is not a joke. It's not some radio guy trying
[19:26.640 --> 19:31.920]  to sound shocking. I have studied reality. I have studied the enemy's own statements.
[19:31.920 --> 19:35.280]  And if anything, it's worse than I'm saying, okay, I want to explain something to you.
[19:35.920 --> 19:40.320]  One will say, you scare me. No, I'm not trying to scare you. The scary stuff's going on whether you
[19:40.320 --> 19:45.280]  admit it or not. We've got to admit we're under attack and do something about it. Okay, that's
[19:45.280 --> 19:49.120]  what I'm here to tell you. And all of you that are delusional and think you're part of the winning
[19:49.120 --> 19:54.560]  power structure, you're not. At the end of this thing, you're dead, I'm dead. Okay, the globalist
[19:54.560 --> 20:04.400]  want global exterminism. Introducing Pro One, all of your filtration in one system portable on the

[22:40.160 --> 22:43.760]  correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the
[22:43.760 --> 22:47.440]  liberties of the people than a standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver

[23:54.800 --> 24:08.000]  For emergency preparedness, self-reliance and food independence.
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.880]  You know, I've talked about it, but I still haven't played the video clip that Luke
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.680]  Rudowski got an interview with Michael Moore where he said last week, hey, you don't need a
[24:15.680 --> 24:20.960]  gun. Get a dog. This is a guy that has up to six bodyguards that are armed. They've been arrested
[24:20.960 --> 24:26.480]  for being armed in illegal prohibited areas. I mean, this is a total hypocrite. And I was
[24:26.480 --> 24:31.600]  just thinking about that during the breaks while I mentioned it. Also, calling into the show was
[24:32.640 --> 24:38.720]  Ted Nugent yesterday. And it was not the Ted Nugent when he's out kind of as a machine doing
[24:38.720 --> 24:43.520]  interviews. It was the real Ted Nugent, which is similar to the Ted Nugent you hear on air.
[24:44.160 --> 24:47.760]  I'm not saying he's being disingenuous. I'm saying he was more candid and stuff
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.840]  on air and off air with me because now stuff's getting so hardcore.
[24:52.640 --> 24:58.400]  The things he's personally been experiencing. See, this isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:58.400 --> 25:03.760]  It's what I keep trying to get across to you. This is not a game. The globalists see it as a game
[25:03.760 --> 25:08.480]  and the whole world's a simulation. They have every person, every piece of equipment, everything
[25:08.480 --> 25:12.960]  in the world that they can track in giant Pentagon and other globalist simulations.
[25:12.960 --> 25:18.960]  That's on record. MIT, you name it. The RFID, the tracker chips, the smart grid that's going in.
[25:18.960 --> 25:23.280]  Sure, it's great to be able to turn the lights off at your house or see what's going on via
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.440]  a remote camera. The problem is it's all been designed and back doored to control us. Yeah,
[25:29.440 --> 25:33.360]  there's nothing wrong with a gun until a crazy person comes with a gun to kill you.
[25:34.640 --> 25:37.760]  And then you've got to have a gun to protect yourself, meet force with force.
[25:37.760 --> 25:43.280]  But here the globalists run the whole system and it's a whole level above anything we can
[25:43.280 --> 25:50.800]  technologically even understand. And it's a whole level of total war against the species
[25:51.440 --> 25:56.480]  and a full spectrum dominance where the global technocrats fund the enemies themselves
[25:56.480 --> 26:02.320]  and add that into the simulation to where it is a matrix level false reality.
[26:02.320 --> 26:09.920]  But it's three dimensional. The system is attempting to build a totally false construct
[26:09.920 --> 26:14.560]  where then you go out and simulate. The police don't even know why they call it their role
[26:15.200 --> 26:19.840]  or the military, our role or we're going to do this drill. It's all acting.
[26:20.880 --> 26:25.600]  And then Al Qaeda works for the globalist and only their top people know that.
[26:26.560 --> 26:30.960]  And then people are fighting and dying. It's a real war, but it's totally scripted,
[26:30.960 --> 26:36.240]  funded by the mega banks. The Vatican being brought down by the globalist for full control
[26:36.240 --> 26:43.360]  to put in their new puppet pope, incredible. The British royalty being absolutely
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.960]  blackmailed right now with the pedophile scandal. The prime ministership, all of it.
[26:51.680 --> 26:57.440]  The Penn State, all of this is being activated now. It's always been going on. It's being
[26:57.440 --> 27:02.400]  activated now for blackmail purposes. See, everything is going hot right now.
[27:03.440 --> 27:09.680]  This is the time we've entered the zone of the acceleration of the globalist program.
[27:09.680 --> 27:13.200]  That's why they're going after the guns. That's why they're shutting down the power plants.
[27:13.200 --> 27:18.000]  That's why they're opening up the borders. That's why it's all just going to get crazier from here
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.600]  on out. And we've been trying to shape the battlefield in the info war to get people ready.
[27:23.600 --> 27:29.360]  I knew a decade ago that, and I said this over and over again, that people weren't
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.240]  going to listen at the time, but they would remember what they heard as the next phase
[27:34.240 --> 27:41.120]  came in. And that our real power to wake people up and the great danger zone would be when our
[27:41.120 --> 27:49.120]  credibility rose to that level. And I didn't act bombastic and aggressive and crazy on air
[27:49.120 --> 27:55.920]  on purpose. That's really how I am. But God used that, used that behavior that's entertaining to
[27:55.920 --> 28:05.520]  some to actually be chum in the water, to bring in the sharks. But to also create a spectacle
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.840]  so that people would pay attention and laugh at it in many cases.
[28:10.560 --> 28:15.120]  God works in mysterious ways. And now all these years later, see, people aren't laughing anymore.
[28:15.120 --> 28:21.360]  And they're going to laugh a lot less because myself and Ron Paul and Giambor Griffin and Bob
[28:21.360 --> 28:27.200]  Chapman and thousands of others, the John Birch Society, and so many others. When the media laughs
[28:27.200 --> 28:31.440]  and goes, John Birch Society, crazy kooks, never gives a reason why. It's because they were so
[28:31.440 --> 28:40.400]  dead on, so accurate, absolutely knew what was going on. So, those crazy people, nobody listened
[28:40.400 --> 28:46.240]  to them because, my goodness, discredit that, my goodness, don't go there, my goodness, don't
[28:46.240 --> 28:54.720]  listen to them. Because of all of that, we have major capital, politically, economically,
[28:54.720 --> 29:00.800]  worldwide. That's why they're announcing, the Tea Party's dead, everyone hates it, Obama has won,
[29:00.800 --> 29:07.840]  total mandate for total takeover, as a self-fulfilling prophecy bandwagon effect on the weak-minded.
[29:07.840 --> 29:14.080]  The Republican leadership is, yes, we've all failed, communism is the way to go, socialism,
[29:14.080 --> 29:20.160]  open the borders, socialism, turn your guns in. That's the Republican leadership in a huge hoax.
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.360]  Because what is the Tea Party? The real Tea Party is basically John Birch Society,
[29:25.360 --> 29:29.600]  constitutionalist, there's a New World Order foreign banking takeover of America
[29:29.600 --> 29:32.720]  to set up three global regions and a world government. What's happened?
[29:32.720 --> 29:37.120]  The John Birch Society in the 50s and 60s cited everything, they had the government connections,
[29:37.120 --> 29:42.480]  they had the research, they had people killed over this information, and then it all came true,
[29:42.480 --> 29:49.520]  didn't it, didn't it, didn't it? We're on the march, the empire's on the run,

[33:26.000 --> 33:34.800]  Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern, we are live here, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:35.360 --> 33:41.280]  Weeknights, 7 o'clock Central, prisonplanet.tv. Ron Paul's going to be calling us, I think,
[33:41.280 --> 33:51.520]  in about 10 minutes. So look for some breaking news with the Congressman on the economy and QE
[33:51.520 --> 33:57.280]  Unlimited. Instead of ranting about the nature of the New World Order and the decision we have
[33:57.280 --> 34:04.960]  to make, I just want to say this to everybody. Everyone can feel it. The quickening, the danger,
[34:04.960 --> 34:09.920]  how serious things are. And it's because the globalists have decided to devalue currencies
[34:09.920 --> 34:15.840]  in a coordinated function worldwide. And if you go to mfallwars.com, there's a drone story. We've
[34:15.840 --> 34:24.720]  got another big breaking one coming up. There's a big story up on the site dealing with drones,
[34:25.280 --> 34:33.680]  where the press secretary was told to act as if drone program doesn't exist.
[34:33.680 --> 34:40.480]  The illegal unconstitutional violation of the Geneva Convention drone program just killing
[34:40.480 --> 34:46.560]  people. They say if they appear to be fighting age males, they can just kill them, not even
[34:46.560 --> 34:50.720]  having weapons in their hands, going into countries that haven't authorized it on top of it.
[34:51.760 --> 34:55.680]  In a rare admission, Robert Gibbs, the former White House press secretary under Obama,
[34:55.680 --> 34:59.920]  told reporters Sunday that he was ordered to act as if there were no such thing as active
[34:59.920 --> 35:05.920]  US drone program. It's the same thing. There's no New World Order. There's no currency devaluation.
[35:05.920 --> 35:11.840]  The Federal Reserve isn't private. There's no gun confiscation plan. Well,
[35:11.840 --> 35:16.720]  15, 16 states have introduced bills. They're already trying to confiscate semi-autos and
[35:16.720 --> 35:22.560]  stuff over seven rounds in New York. Here's the Department of Justice memo that's now out,
[35:22.560 --> 35:25.520]  that's some of the big news, saying, yeah, let's just confiscate all the guns.
[35:26.080 --> 35:30.800]  No, there's no Justice Department. Well, yeah, there is. You ran fashion furious. Here's the
[35:30.800 --> 35:34.720]  memo where you said you'd blame it on the Second Amendment. CBS News got it. No, there's not,
[35:34.720 --> 35:42.560]  doesn't exist. I mean, I've had ABC Nightly News here, the host of ABC Nightly News, forget his
[35:42.560 --> 35:47.120]  name, for Nightline, he also does that. And he goes, there's no world government. And then I go,
[35:47.120 --> 35:51.920]  let me show you. And I had literally like 20 different videos and links to world leaders
[35:51.920 --> 35:54.960]  saying world government. And he goes, well, that's a different world government than what
[35:54.960 --> 36:00.640]  you're talking about. And he said, okay, let's go to the park and do an interview.
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.120]  We've done one in here, let's do one in the park. So 30 minutes later, we're at the park.
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.040]  He's got his crew with him. And I go, well, you just saw them in the world government.
[36:09.040 --> 36:13.440]  He goes, no, I didn't, I don't agree to that. And then we went to dinner and he's like,
[36:13.440 --> 36:19.120]  oh, I know, how's your family doing? And he's like, yeah, I agree with what you said at the
[36:19.120 --> 36:26.880]  end. You're a soldier. And then he just stopped right there cuz I said, I'm here a soldier for
[36:26.880 --> 36:30.640]  what I stand for. You're a soldier on your side. That's how the first nightline ended
[36:30.640 --> 36:32.400]  was me saying that out there in the control room.
[36:32.400 --> 36:38.000]  And we're off having dinner with him and his crew. And he's just like, yeah,
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.640]  there's no world government. But there is, Alex. You're a nice guy. But I'm the anchor of ABC
[36:44.640 --> 36:52.960]  Nightly News. And I'm not forgetting his name to be obnoxious. I can't draw his name right
[36:52.960 --> 36:58.960]  now out of my memory. It just shows the mind game. And I sit there and I'm like,
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.520]  I'm not playing your mind game, okay? There is a secret drone program. They do plan to have
[37:03.520 --> 37:11.200]  it domestically roll out. It's already rolled out. Now we have internal videos that these morons,
[37:11.200 --> 37:15.920]  not just one, but we're digging up more, that these morons put on a server and index to be
[37:15.920 --> 37:24.240]  public. Promoting Homeland Security funding drones to spy on gun owners. You cannot make that up.
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.560]  Watson's got it going up very soon at mfallwars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[37:28.560 --> 37:36.320]  I mean, this is the cuckoo level we've gotten to. And Robert Gibbs goes, yeah, I know I look dumb,
[37:36.320 --> 37:39.840]  but they told me to just act like it didn't exist. And this is,
[37:39.840 --> 37:46.880]  understand something, this is when it was on record it was going on. You'd see that with
[37:46.880 --> 37:56.160]  Bush's last, Perino, the blonde. She would get up there and they'd say, is the oil price going up?
[37:56.160 --> 37:59.680]  Because the dollar's being devalued. She would go, I cannot speak to that.
[38:01.200 --> 38:04.800]  And they would go, but the oil price is going up. She goes, I cannot speak to that.
[38:04.800 --> 38:11.440]  I mean, it's this wall of denial. And when you're informed, it's comical. But to the general public,
[38:11.440 --> 38:15.760]  they don't know. Most people don't even watch press conferences. Or if they do, they're in
[38:15.760 --> 38:20.560]  the media and then they're lazy about it. They just repeat whatever government says.
[38:20.560 --> 38:24.480]  So you've got a huge corrupt world government that's been set up.
[38:26.560 --> 38:27.920]  I mean, look at some of these headlines.
[38:27.920 --> 38:33.120]  Lobbyist demands approval for lethal drones within the United States. Former Obama press
[38:33.120 --> 38:35.760]  secretary was ordered to act as if drone program did not exist.
[38:38.160 --> 38:43.920]  Moretta tells Maryland it will move operations if gun law is enacted. And a bunch of gun
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.920]  manufacturers, as you know, over the weekend, came out and said, we will no longer sell to
[38:47.920 --> 38:52.640]  government, federal or state, any of these firearms if you deny them to the citizens.
[38:52.640 --> 38:58.880]  And that's how you need to act, folks. Gun owners, gun shops, companies,
[38:58.880 --> 39:03.360]  corporations that aren't global traders, you do not do business with the enemy.
[39:04.240 --> 39:08.880]  This is life and death, folks. We've got to use the power of the purse that we have left
[39:08.880 --> 39:14.240]  in boycotts or it's over. You've got to live for the rebellion against tyranny.
[39:14.240 --> 39:20.640]  You've got to live for the Republic. Plus, if you do that and try to buy local,
[39:20.640 --> 39:25.920]  try to buy American, none of us are perfect. Try to speak out against the globalist,
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.520]  vote with your dollars, vote with your mouth, vote with word of mouth,
[39:29.520 --> 39:34.880]  vote on the jury box, the grand jury. When you do that, it hurts the globalist.
[39:34.880 --> 39:39.600]  I mean, they need us to go along with them. They need us to buy into their system.
[39:40.160 --> 39:44.640]  You don't have to die for the revolution. You've got to live for the revolution.
[39:44.640 --> 39:47.280]  That's what a mortal technique said, and I'm definitely going to,
[39:47.280 --> 39:50.880]  I know that's been said by others before, but it's absolutely true.
[39:52.560 --> 39:56.720]  You've got to define the real revolution, not the collectivist corporate fascist,
[39:56.720 --> 40:03.040]  not the collectivist socialist or communist, no. Real local control, real sustainability,
[40:03.040 --> 40:07.920]  not the fake UN counterfeit that's really unsustainability. See, everything with them
[40:07.920 --> 40:12.560]  has one label, but is the opposite. Or if you catch them doing something, they just go,
[40:12.560 --> 40:17.840]  no, you didn't. Hey, Wells Fargo, you got caught with LeCoveo laundering $300 and something
[40:17.840 --> 40:24.720]  million of drug money. No, we didn't. Well, yeah, I mean, here it is admitted in the news.
[40:24.720 --> 40:30.160]  No, we didn't. They play this game with you, hoping that you're not really informed,
[40:30.160 --> 40:34.480]  hoping that it just matters. Well, MSNBC says there's no New World Order and Alex
[40:34.480 --> 40:40.160]  Jones is crazy, but Alex Jones has all this proof. But MSNBC has a fancier looking studio,
[40:40.160 --> 40:48.640]  and their people read off a teleprompter, so it looks slicker. I'm gonna go with them.
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.240]  So here's some of the gun grabbing news. DOJ memo, outlaw and confiscate all guns,
[40:58.240 --> 41:03.760]  infowars.com. NRAs come out with the memo they got. And the White House has responded going,
[41:03.760 --> 41:07.680]  well, that's not our official policy, but it is the recommendation. Just shows that
[41:07.680 --> 41:11.680]  they're disingenuous, they wanna confiscate your guns. And I know most of you know that,
[41:11.680 --> 41:15.440]  but the average gun owner still is going, they're unreasonable.
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.920]  Salt weapons aren't used in many crimes, why do they wanna ban them? That won't help the kids,
[41:19.920 --> 41:25.120]  it doesn't make sense. Because they don't care about the kids, folks, it's about disarming us
[41:25.120 --> 41:32.800]  ahead of an organized collapse. Go read the summary of select firearms violence prevention
[41:32.800 --> 41:42.160]  strategies, go read it. Then we've got feds buy 2 billion rounds of ammo, and the DHS contractor,
[41:42.160 --> 41:46.640]  remember last Monday we broke this, on Friday apologized for selling shooting targets of
[41:46.640 --> 41:51.920]  children. And said they were told to print up $2 million worth of these by Homeland Security,
[41:51.920 --> 41:57.760]  as if that's okay. And remember, even my listeners on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday,
[41:57.760 --> 42:00.880]  we got a major backlash saying this wasn't real.
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.240]  And there were false hoaxes run on the web saying we'd made it up. And those are obviously sock
[42:06.240 --> 42:13.200]  puppets, folks. When we had the company, and the company been recorded and put out a press release
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.200]  on Tuesday confirming our report, still people are saying this isn't real.
[42:17.920 --> 42:23.200]  Just like they were told to say there are no drones. We wanna know about the drone program
[42:23.200 --> 42:29.360]  killing 100 plus villagers and children illegally in Pakistan. There is no drone program.
[42:29.360 --> 42:34.480]  Well, I guess there is a drone program. Next question, no, there isn't. And see,
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.880]  it's more than that. The globalists admit they're practicing lying in our faces
[42:39.440 --> 42:44.160]  just to get us used to it to where, yeah, that's just what they do. Crazy lies.
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.760]  Oh, there's no paper targets. There's no 1.6 million bullets. Remember the news said that
[42:49.760 --> 42:54.400]  a few weeks ago. There's no, last year they said I made it up. Doesn't matter, it's all true,
[42:54.400 --> 42:57.600]  all public. They know you don't know how to go check a federal purchase order.
[42:57.600 --> 43:03.040]  They know you don't follow the links. Most mainline people watching CNN when they say
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.000]  I'm lying about it, they just go, no, it was only 2 million bullets for the DHS.
[43:08.000 --> 43:14.160]  Not mentioning the fine print on CNN and then Washington Post was, they just focused on one
[43:14.160 --> 43:19.600]  little part of the purchase to say, the Social Security Administration responds by saying they
[43:19.600 --> 43:27.920]  need that. So Jones is wrong about the 1.6 million bullets. I mean, it's all just twisted lying.
[43:29.120 --> 43:35.280]  But it works with the dumbed down mass out there. Cuz I mean, if Wolf Blitzer's standing there in
[43:35.280 --> 43:42.720]  a big glistening giant studio that looks like it's the set of Dr. Ebel's command center or something,
[43:42.720 --> 43:52.720]  then I mean, come on, it's Wolf Blitzer folks, he's got a great beard.
[43:52.720 --> 44:02.720]  So that is the type of garbage that we are dealing with. Ron Paul called yet? Okay.
[44:02.720 --> 44:15.280]  Man, I tell you, I got a big stack of news here. Why is Walmart worried payroll taxes
[44:15.280 --> 44:21.360]  could cut consumer spending? That's out of the Christian Science Monitor. Could cut the spending?
[44:22.720 --> 44:28.240]  Could cut the spending? Spending has already contracted since the payroll taxes kicked in
[44:28.240 --> 44:34.160]  the last month. It's on record that consumer spending has already plunged,
[44:34.160 --> 44:38.160]  and that hiring has plunged, and that because of government-run healthcare,
[44:38.160 --> 44:44.800]  companies are laying off from 40 hours down to below 30 so that they don't have to get you
[44:44.800 --> 44:50.080]  Obamacare. It was written by big industry to hammer the American worker and drive you into
[44:50.080 --> 44:59.680]  the welfare rolls for collectivization. It was written by the big insurance companies
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.320]  to double premiums the first year and then allow them to tell doctors what care they can give
[45:04.320 --> 45:08.480]  to double premiums and cut the care you get when you're paying for it.
[45:10.160 --> 45:14.640]  I mean, you couldn't have written something nastier. You couldn't have written something
[45:14.640 --> 45:23.280]  meaner. You couldn't have written something that would have wrecked healthcare worse than this.
[45:28.960 --> 45:32.640]  You absolutely could not have come up
[45:35.440 --> 45:41.440]  with something more diabolical. Now, he's only got about 15 minutes with us. Former
[45:41.440 --> 45:47.600]  Congressman Ron Paul, best-selling author, joins us. I wanted to get him on because he's been
[45:47.600 --> 45:54.560]  writing and speaking and posting articles at Campaign for Liberty. Breaking down the bubble
[45:54.560 --> 46:00.320]  is really getting big, the QE Unlimited, the global currency crises with the very authors
[46:00.320 --> 46:06.240]  of the currency crises posing as our saviors. And just last week, more proposals by the G20
[46:06.240 --> 46:12.240]  for a Bank of the World, SDR, that's global government, to back it all up. Ron Paul,
[46:12.240 --> 46:15.680]  Dr. Ron Paul, thank you for coming on, sir. Thank you. Good to be with you.
[46:17.360 --> 46:21.600]  Can you give us the latest on your analysis on what's happening with the economy and
[46:22.240 --> 46:27.760]  this big event you've been talking about last few years? How close are we right now? How serious
[46:27.760 --> 46:33.440]  is this currency war? Well, I think in many ways, we're in the middle of it. I think the
[46:33.440 --> 46:40.240]  evidence to the general public is still not there, and there's not been a panic. But the
[46:40.240 --> 46:45.120]  people in Washington and even our central bankers don't face up to the real truth of the matter,
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.960]  and that is we're totally bankrupt, and yet just putting more money and running up more debt
[46:50.960 --> 46:57.760]  seems to settle the markets. They don't dump their stocks. They don't dump their bonds.
[46:57.760 --> 47:04.400]  But we're in the middle of some unwinding. I think that this is so much different than anything we've
[47:04.400 --> 47:10.240]  gone through, you know, since World War II and especially even since 1971 with the breakdown
[47:10.240 --> 47:16.320]  of Bretton Woods. But one of these days, we'll wake up some morning and realize that the whole
[47:16.320 --> 47:21.920]  world has given up on the system, just as we woke up one day and the world and especially the
[47:21.920 --> 47:27.200]  Soviets gave up on the Soviet Union, because the system we have, the monetary system we have,
[47:27.200 --> 47:34.800]  and the economic system is not viable. It can't work, and you can't solve the problem with more debt.
[47:34.800 --> 47:40.320]  And when that particular day comes, I don't think anybody knows the exact day, but
[47:40.320 --> 47:45.760]  we're certainly getting very close to it. Congressman, getting into specifics and your
[47:45.760 --> 47:51.200]  research there with the Von Mies Institute, pretty much everything you predicted in the last 30 years
[47:51.200 --> 47:55.840]  is now unfolding. From all my research and even with the establishment saying and the way they're
[47:55.840 --> 48:01.680]  behaving, it's all coming to a head. Now it's two billion rounds of bullets and hollow points that
[48:01.680 --> 48:06.160]  are illegal under the Geneva Convention. We've got a new report out where Homeland Security is
[48:06.160 --> 48:12.720]  funding domestic drones, and I'm not making this up, to quote, track gun purchases. That just broke
[48:12.720 --> 48:18.720]  at infoawards.com. Now we see military drills expanding everywhere. We see the new Justice
[48:18.720 --> 48:24.480]  Department memo saying, hey, let's just ban guns and confiscate them. It's like I've woken up in
[48:24.480 --> 48:32.320]  a Orwellian nightmare, and we've got this normalcy bias, this mass Stockholm syndrome, where even
[48:32.320 --> 48:36.640]  mainline conservatives, I had Ted Nugent on yesterday. He said, look, the green light's
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.520]  been given on Benghazi, the green light's been given on all this other tyranny, Fast and Furious,
[48:41.520 --> 48:46.560]  nobody got in trouble. And so I think we've reached that point where the tyrants figure out
[48:46.560 --> 48:49.920]  that if they can take us an inch, why not take us a million miles?
[48:49.920 --> 48:54.560]  No, and I've been getting away with it, but don't you think this has started a while back,
[48:54.560 --> 49:00.960]  and it's just accelerating. And if you go back to what happened at Waco, if you go back to
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.680]  what happened at Ruby Ridge, I mean, if they can get away with it, they do it. And nobody ever got
[49:05.680 --> 49:10.720]  punished for those mistakes that were made, and now nobody gets punished at all. Matter of fact,
[49:10.720 --> 49:15.760]  the Congress goes along with it. The Congress doesn't really resist and put restraint on the
[49:15.760 --> 49:21.920]  president when it comes to kill this and the use of drones and assassinations, and the funding
[49:21.920 --> 49:26.480]  continues. So it's a very dangerous time that we live in.
[49:27.440 --> 49:33.920]  Undoubtedly, specifically with all the paramilitary buildup, the arms race going
[49:33.920 --> 49:38.080]  on domestically, what do you think the feds are planning? What do you think they're preparing for,
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.400]  Dr. Paul? Well, I think they prepare for everything and they themselves,
[49:42.400 --> 49:47.120]  you know, go with the flow. They don't know exactly what will happen, but they're prepared.
[49:48.800 --> 49:53.200]  They don't know that in two months from now there's riots in the street, but they know that
[49:53.200 --> 50:00.640]  there could be. And the same way with the monetary system, they argue academically that, oh yes,
[50:00.640 --> 50:05.840]  it's okay to print money and debt doesn't matter, you know, the Paul Krugman argument. But I think
[50:05.840 --> 50:10.480]  they know exactly what can happen, the consequence that we warn about and try to prepare for,
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.480]  so they make their preparations. Like I think you mentioned in your introduction about
[50:14.480 --> 50:20.400]  what they do at the international level, under the UN and the IMF and the, you know, these
[50:20.960 --> 50:26.960]  group of 20 and all these, they do plan. So we know what would be the answer, that is,
[50:26.960 --> 50:32.880]  sound money and honest money and have commodity money. They want to maintain their power,
[50:32.880 --> 50:38.480]  so they're laying their plans too, but I don't think they know the day they're going to use it
[50:38.480 --> 50:45.600]  they plan for all contingencies, because the action of human beings are not predictable.
[50:45.600 --> 50:51.680]  But when certain events come about, they're laying their plans in their network, so,
[50:52.560 --> 51:00.400]  and it's really scary when you think about the drone. The drone thing should, you know, wake up
[51:00.400 --> 51:05.680]  everybody on what they can do, how much surveillance, how many weapons can they carry,
[51:05.680 --> 51:11.120]  when they pretend that they can target any one individual thousands of miles away from
[51:11.680 --> 51:17.040]  the United States with people who maneuver those things even here, what can they do if they decide,
[51:17.040 --> 51:21.120]  well, we're going after this drug dealer, we're going after this guy that owns an illegal weapon,
[51:22.160 --> 51:30.720]  who knows what. And what we do know is in spite of their fantastic, you know, ability,
[51:30.720 --> 51:37.200]  you know, the advancement in these weapons, we do know that they make a lot of mistakes.
[51:37.200 --> 51:43.280]  There's a lot of collateral damage and they just write it off. And so I would expect that
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.360]  the people in charge know that there's trouble ahead and they're laying their plans
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.240]  to react in any way they think necessary.
[51:52.240 --> 51:54.800]  Sure. Dr. Ron Paul is our guest here. Sir,
[51:55.760 --> 52:00.400]  undoubtedly, and I want you to break this down in your own words, but you've spoken to it before,
[52:00.400 --> 52:04.400]  but I marvel, we've had big government, we've had tyrannies before around the world,
[52:05.040 --> 52:11.040]  but the socialist collectivist clash funded by the big special interests that want a monopoly,
[52:11.040 --> 52:15.120]  obviously, of power to write health care. Of course, you know about this
[52:16.240 --> 52:21.280]  being a retired medical doctor, but my dad's a dentist, oral surgeon, he's also in medical
[52:21.280 --> 52:25.840]  management. And he said to me, he said, son, I knew it when I read the bill, but he's watching
[52:25.840 --> 52:35.760]  it happen. Raising payroll taxes on poor people, taxes on investments, doubling premiums this year.
[52:35.760 --> 52:40.400]  I mean, this is designed to kill the American economy that's competing with China. Obama's
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.920]  shutting down the power plants. They are clearly trying to shut down the economy so that everybody
[52:45.920 --> 52:51.520]  goes on welfare and basically bankrupts. This is an economic takeover. Do you agree with that or
[52:51.520 --> 52:59.440]  can you speak to that? Absolutely. Now, I don't know if I have an absolute insight on all the
[52:59.440 --> 53:05.440]  motivations because there's a mixture up there. I mean, there are evil people who have evil motives
[53:05.440 --> 53:09.840]  and they want to do exactly what's happening. There are others though, who are intellectually
[53:09.840 --> 53:16.160]  wholly bankrupt and actually believe this stuff. You know, I think Paul Krugman doesn't sit down
[53:16.160 --> 53:22.480]  and conspire to blow up the world financially. I think he sits down and he is dedicated to
[53:22.480 --> 53:28.080]  proving his philosophy on money and credit are the correct ones. And then there's a lot of other
[53:28.080 --> 53:32.640]  people who are very gullible out there. You know, how many people did Obama lose the election?
[53:33.520 --> 53:38.640]  Sure, but I mean, Obama said he was going to give poor people free stuff. He's literally raping them.
[53:38.640 --> 53:44.480]  Yeah. So there's the people are naive enough to believe that. So you put all that together
[53:44.480 --> 53:50.800]  and you end up with this calamity because they do not deal with the world as we would like to
[53:50.800 --> 53:55.440]  deal with it. And that is concentrating on the individuals who have a right to their own life,
[53:55.440 --> 54:00.240]  have a right to the keep the fruits of their labor, have property rights and contract rights
[54:00.240 --> 54:04.960]  and sound money and get the government out of our way. So they don't work on that.
[54:04.960 --> 54:09.200]  They work on the opposite. Sure, but Dr. Paul, here's my question.
[54:09.200 --> 54:13.680]  Trying to figure out exactly their scheme and their plan and who did what when
[54:13.680 --> 54:19.760]  has to be counteracted by us getting out in front and saying there is a better way in that way is
[54:19.760 --> 54:23.840]  something that we had a taste of in this country and we're losing it. We need to wake up the
[54:23.840 --> 54:29.120]  American people that the answers the answers are there for us. We just want to look. And I think I
[54:29.120 --> 54:35.360]  think in many ways that is happening. A lot more people are waking up, but it's going to be a
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.440]  terribly tough struggle. Sure. I want to get into the second amendment. I don't know if you've seen
[54:39.440 --> 54:45.120]  this. It broke Friday, but you're always onto the news. I bring up a summary of select firearms
[54:45.120 --> 54:50.480]  violence prevention strategies for the White House by the Department of Justice actually says
[54:51.200 --> 54:54.560]  basically just outlaw almost all guns and make people turn them in.
[54:55.360 --> 55:00.800]  And now veterans are getting letters who haven't even been diagnosed as being incompetent,
[55:00.800 --> 55:04.960]  being told, prepare to turn your guns in. If they try to take the guns,
[55:04.960 --> 55:12.800]  Congressman, are they trying to start a civil war? Well, you know, that's once again is trying to
[55:12.800 --> 55:17.280]  interpret everything that they're thinking in their planning. They're liable to start a civil
[55:17.280 --> 55:22.480]  war by doing it for whatever reason they are. But they don't believe that people should have
[55:22.480 --> 55:26.720]  guns. They believe the government should have guns. And they believe this very sincerely as
[55:26.720 --> 55:35.600]  as a philosophy. So, yes, they're whether that is exactly what they want. It's hard to say.
[55:35.600 --> 55:39.280]  But I know one thing is they don't want the people to have the guns. But, you know,
[55:39.280 --> 55:45.600]  I don't. It's one thing. I think a lot about these problems, but I just don't think that
[55:45.600 --> 55:50.160]  the people are going to give up their guns. I agree. I agree. This is when wars start,
[55:50.160 --> 55:55.120]  when both groups aren't given up like two trains and the politicians are off in their ivory towers
[55:55.120 --> 55:59.920]  drinking champagne, saying let them eat cake. In closing, sir, we've only got about three minutes
[55:59.920 --> 56:06.960]  left campaignforliberty.org. I know you've got some big announcements coming. What Dr. Paul's
[56:06.960 --> 56:13.440]  going to do now that you've left Congress. Can you give us a little idea on when these announcements
[56:13.440 --> 56:19.600]  are going to be made so that we can all get behind it? Yeah, I think they're coming together now.
[56:19.600 --> 56:25.360]  It was recently announced about the radio broadcast that we'll be doing, and I feel very
[56:25.360 --> 56:29.440]  fortunate that we have that. But there will be others, and I would say in the next three months
[56:29.440 --> 56:35.760]  or so that we should have some of this coming out, and I'll have another book. And so a lot of people
[56:36.560 --> 56:42.880]  thought that I would be able to sit still and just watch this thing go on, and there's no way.
[56:42.880 --> 56:48.400]  I'm really excited about the opportunities I have now. My time is more my own. I get to travel when
[56:48.400 --> 56:54.240]  I want. I don't have to get on that airplane when John Boehner says I have to go up there to vote.
[56:54.240 --> 56:59.840]  So I have a lot more freedom and a lot more opportunities, and hopefully if I do a good job,
[56:59.840 --> 57:04.240]  I will reach more people, not less people. You know, there were a lot of speeches I had to get
[57:04.240 --> 57:10.800]  when there were nobody, no people in the audience, you know, when you take a talk at Congress.
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.840]  So I'm, you know, like on Monday, I'm going to be, a week from today, I'll be at George
[57:15.840 --> 57:21.200]  Washington University in Washington. Hopefully I have a nice crowd out there. So you have only
[57:21.200 --> 57:26.240]  begun, you have only begun to fight campaignforliberty.org. How long until you get your
[57:26.240 --> 57:34.880]  website, Ron Paul? Well, that's up in the air. We're still working on that, but I don't sit and
[57:34.880 --> 57:39.600]  worry about that. I know it's going to come out to our best, and we will be able to take care of
[57:39.600 --> 57:45.840]  whether there's enough flexibility out there. But you know, I lean toward believing that I'll once
[57:45.840 --> 57:52.720]  again be able to have RonPaul.com. Very exciting. Sir, all I can say is Godspeed. We thank you for
[57:52.720 --> 58:00.080]  your work. Can we get you to call for impeachment of Obama for Fast and Furious? I know you're not
[58:00.080 --> 58:06.880]  in Congress now, but should we get a movement to try to impeach Obama? Well, if you're energized
[58:06.880 --> 58:11.360]  to do that, I can think of other things to do, but people say, well, should he be, should he be
[58:11.360 --> 58:16.720]  impeached? Well, impeach him. I think no matter which president was probably for the past 50
[58:16.720 --> 58:21.360]  years, for most likely, I would have found reason to impeach him because, and I didn't impeach the
[58:21.360 --> 58:26.640]  whole Congress. So it's an overwhelming task to get everybody out of Washington that ought to
[58:26.640 --> 58:35.440]  be impeached or thrown out. But some people see that as a, as a good tool, but the political issue
[58:35.440 --> 58:46.560]  and- Thank you, RonPaul. Thank you so much, sir. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio
[58:46.560 --> 58:54.800]  Network. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting
[58:54.800 --> 59:00.320]  weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[59:00.320 --> 59:06.080]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what
[59:06.080 --> 59:10.720]  I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products
[59:10.720 --> 59:17.920]  at infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds
[59:17.920 --> 59:24.640]  in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[59:24.640 --> 59:28.640]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[59:28.640 --> 59:34.800]  than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go
[59:34.800 --> 59:40.800]  to infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products. And you will see the changes
[59:40.800 --> 59:45.600]  in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately. Start your

[59:49.280 --> 59:58.480]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:12.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:21.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.600]  All right, we've got breaking news that should be up any minute. It's huge.
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.440]  And guys, get the video as soon as it goes live. Watson already had the video earlier today. We
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.480]  probably should have already gotten it. Call Watson, ask him, I forgot to tell you that,
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.920]  of the drone video he's got. Ask him for that immediately so that we have that as soon as
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:51.520]  the article comes out in the next 10, 15 minutes. Just incredible information on the drone front.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.840]  I'm just gonna leave it at that. And I will get to a ton of news as well. Oh, it's up.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:07.120]  It just went live. Okay, video, DHS-funded drone spies on private gun sale. I'm not kidding. You
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:17.760]  cannot make this up. You cannot make this up now live at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.680]  And just hit refresh cuz we don't have auto refresh on the site.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.760]  We probably should put that in there, but people can complain. Maybe we should set auto refresh
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.840]  to every hour or something as people don't remember to hit refresh and they have yesterday's
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:35.440]  news up there. Cuz see, we have to use caching cuz our site gets so many visitors, or the site
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.320]  would go down, but then it's a cash-heavy site. I don't wanna get into Internet stuff.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.800]  I'm gonna cover this when we come back from break. So this has now gone live at infowars.com.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:53.040]  In fact, guys, dial up Watson. Let's get him on Skype right now. Yeah, let's just call Watson,
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.720]  get him in front of the Skype for the next segment, and then get that video grabbed
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.040]  as fast as you can. And you know what? This dovetails with the video. I never aired all
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.640]  of it last week. The one about the Pentagon mini drones, where the big mama drone flies over the
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:14.560]  mothership and then drops the drones on you. I'm gonna cover this, and then I'm going to
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.160]  go to your phone calls. And I'll give the number out in the next segment.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:26.000]  And then I wanna ask listeners, we got a total arms race by our so-called government
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.720]  that's been hijacked by foreign banks. You've got the media involved in collaboration selling
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:36.800]  total tyranny as if it's a loving thing like mommy making you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:42.640]  It's time to say no to this, and it's time to admit how hardcore everything's gotten.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:48.320]  And then we're also going to get to the Ted Nugent video. Ted Nugent called into the show
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.680]  yesterday, and I wanna hear the first five minutes of it. Jacari Jackson's gonna cut
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.320]  the 20-minute interview or so down to five minutes, some of the highlights.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.280]  That was a pretty good interview with Ted Nugent, and he's getting harassed,
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:06.400]  something fierce by the feds right now. So that's coming up as well. But it really makes me mad,
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:12.080]  as I talked about with Congressman Ron Paul, who just joined us. It really, really angers me
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.680]  at a fundamental level that the system is trying to bankrupt poor people,
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.680]  to put them on welfare, to then start cutting the welfare later.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.760]  It's bad enough to make somebody dependent, but then to make them dependent and then cut it off
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:33.680]  incrementally in just a slow Ataconda or boa constrictor kill.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.160]  I'm not taking this sitting down, is my point. And it's not that I'm a hero or a tough guy, but
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.560]  any mammal out there, if you corner it, it will fight back. And I'm still wired that way,
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.760]  and it's pathetic that people see that as so honorable.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.880]  Well, this happened everywhere I went this weekend. Everywhere I went this weekend,
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:05.120]  basically everyone knew who I was and was a listener. I mean, I drove 30 miles outside
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:12.240]  Austin to a small town, it happened there. And I don't mind it except that it's just weird to never
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:21.600]  have any privacy. And I'm not talking about that to go, I'm famous.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:28.400]  No, I mean, listen, I can go to Minnesota, I can go to Chicago, I can go to New York City.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.720]  I can go to California, I can go to Honduras, and I've been to Honduras, and people stopped me
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.080]  walking down the street, large numbers of them. But now, I mean, I could go to England seven,
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.920]  eight years ago and have like every 20, 30th person I walked by stop me a listener.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.960]  Now it's like, I don't know how this show is so big because the numbers aren't there. Sure,
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.040]  we show about 15 million people one way or another every week here or see the show, but
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.280]  this is a lot bigger than that. I don't know what's going on. But we should be able to take
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:03.360]  the country back with this many people awake. Introducing Pro One, all of your filtration

[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:37.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Monday edition. We have breaking news
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:45.360]  right now. Video DHS funded drone spies on private gun sales. A company hired and paid to produce
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:52.960]  drones specifically to spy on the American people. This is breaking on infowars.com, prisonblended.com,
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:09:00.000]  Infowars Nightly News exclusive. Right now, this is big. You're tied into veterans by,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.960]  it's gotta be the tens of thousands. I ran into people this weekend who were vets who have no
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.240]  background in mental illness getting letters saying, prepare to turn your guns in.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.120]  The NRA got a hold of the memo. The White House responded saying it is their memo
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.200]  from the Justice Department saying we need to register all the guns and then confiscate them
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.320]  basically all. It says all guns are bad. They should just all be taken. Incredible. And they
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:28.560]  say only 35 people actually died to mass shooting, which is true. They say it's 87, but they go on to
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:36.640]  say most of those were gangs killing each other. So it was only 35. And so they use that to say,
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.160]  let's just take them all. You've got that the 2 billion rounds of ammo, the military training for
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.520]  domestic operations, the army manuals for gun confiscation, the army manuals for domestic
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:54.240]  FEMA camps. All official, just type in army manual FEMA camp. It's all official, army times,
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:59.520]  you name it. It's crazy, ladies and gentlemen. It's crazy what's going on.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:05.680]  But if we can force a public debate about this, it's unconstitutional, it's illegal.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.640]  We can reverse it and say no, we don't want smart meters spying on all of our appliances
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:16.080]  and tracking us as the CIA director had told Wired Magazine they do. We told you that 10 years ago,
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.160]  but it's in your face cuz they're just getting you used to it. Yeah, we're watching your kids
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.000]  at home over the laptops the school gave them that you paid for with tax money.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.360]  Well, that's 1984. No, it's no big deal. Again, Robert Gibbs has now gone public saying
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.880]  he was told to just say drones didn't even exist, even when they were admitted the drone program.
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.760]  Because they're talking to an audience that is dumbed down. They're targeting the general public
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.920]  as if we're a bunch of idiots. So you've got this massive buildup against the people.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.920]  And you've got the paper targets of gun owners and women and children and a lady in her bathrobe
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.920]  and a five year old boy and says no hesitation. These are your new targets.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.040]  The company apologized but said, hey, Homeland Security bought 2 million of these from us,
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.040]  $2 million worth. They asked for these, one of the biggest paper target makers in the country.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.520]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, this is outrageous what's going on.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.400]  This is outrageous that the Marines and Army are training in mass
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.680]  programs of just mowing down thousands of people dressed as US civilians.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.920]  But it's okay because they use the code that they're zombies.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:34.480]  So you have a giant buildup by our so-called government to kill us. Enough bullets to kill
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:41.360]  every American six times now, over 2 billion rounds. The strike vehicles, the tanks,
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:50.800]  the helicopters, the drones, all of this. DHS video, video, DHS funded drone spies on private
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:57.920]  gun sale, incredible. Promotional material for Shadowhawk depicts firearms transaction
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.000]  as criminal activity. The promotional video for a surveillance drone now being
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.600]  purchased by law enforcement bodies across the country with the aid of DHS funding shows a UAV
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.160]  spying on a private gun sale. Now again, everything, not just this.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:17.840]  It was just this, it'd be worrisome, but it's hundreds of data points. It's all about what
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:24.400]  is the Homeland Security Manual say? Gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalist,
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:30.560]  in the fetters, Ron Paul supporters, anti New World Order people, conspiracy theorists.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:36.880]  But what's number one? Returning veterans, returning, they even have,
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.080]  we broke this years ago, but it suddenly got in the news last week.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:45.920]  The first class of FEMA Corps being graduated, paramilitary. I have the article,
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.800]  I have the article, new defense clandestine service,
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.960]  when civilian and military operations, that domestic security force with a base
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:59.680]  goon level, schmuck, tattletale. Chivano, I guess that's what Tony Montana, a rat, a spy.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.440]  You want a Chivano on every corner? Watching you, telling you what to eat,
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.160]  when to sleep, what to wear. You like squid?
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:15.120]  You a sheep? I mean, come on, folks. Is this classical hardcore tyranny
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:21.440]  the biggest, fattest, ugliest thing the world's ever seen? In our face, using military tactics
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.160]  of saying, I don't exist, I don't exist, I don't exist. Let me explain something to the globalist.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:31.040]  You see 10 million guns a month being sold, you see the panic out there for a real reason?
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.920]  Sometimes a panic's a good thing, get people out of their trance. America knows about the
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:41.680]  foreign takeover. What I'm talking about is now being picked up by every other major talk show
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.960]  host. You understand that? Not because I'm some great person, I was just someone aware of it
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.200]  before others who didn't care how I sounded. And didn't care about how many radio stations I was
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.240]  on because I had to get the word out any way I could. I just smelled out 150,000 free bumper
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.960]  stickers. It even paid for the shipping. I'd mail out 10 million if I had the money.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.720]  But I'm so busy covering news, I don't even plug money. Go to infowarshop.com,
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:12.960]  buy Propure water filters, already has the lowest price, buy shirts, DVDs, films, books, buy it all.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.880]  I'm telling you, if I got a million dollar donation right now, I'd spend 100% of it on
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.600]  mailing out, I don't know how many, it would cost $35,000 for the stickers and the shipping.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.520]  About 32,000, 33,000, I forget. The point is, how many would a million dollars worth of bumper
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:33.840]  stickers? And the average bumper sticker is seen by 20,000 people in one year, in its lifetime.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:40.960]  Average lifetime about a year, 12 months, some last longer. It'd be billions of views,
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.400]  billions. I mean, listen, this is real, folks. I'm willing to die for this information.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.400]  But I intend to win the info war with God's help. You are living at the crossroads. This is an
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.280]  incredible time to be alive. Everything's happening right now and it's just started.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.280]  The fuse is lit, folks. All the stuff you see is just the fuse burning. The explosion politically
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.360]  is either gonna go into total tyranny, and they're gonna use that to totally take over.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.240]  Or we, like Judo, use their energy against them and rip their arms politically out of their
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:18.640]  sockets. And I'm telling you, this is it, ladies and gentlemen. This is it. This is the big
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:25.760]  enchilada right here. This is it right now. Listen, you gotta act now. You don't act later,
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:31.040]  like, well, what do I do? Speak out, warn people, call and talk radio, go speak at city council.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.880]  Hit your knees and say, God, I wanna fight the corruption. I wanna defend the innocent.
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.920]  God, tell me what to do. Believe me, believe me. You know what God really likes? I'm telling you
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:47.120]  this from experience. God likes you just saying, hey, I'm not praying for anything except please
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:52.160]  have me do what you want. I'm weak, take me over. That's the prayer right there. Take me over.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.280]  I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours. Okay, that's the answer.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:03.280]  Because this is it, ladies and gentlemen, this is the big one, okay? Everybody can feel everybody
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.760]  can see it, but it's all just gonna get crazier from here on out. Listen to this promotional video
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.560]  for the surveillance drone now being purchased, you guys can start rolling it over me. The
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.280]  promotional video for surveillance drone now being purchased by law enforcement bodies across
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:28.080]  the country with the aid of DHS funding shows a UAV spying on a private gun sale.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.080]  The promotional video for a surveillance drone now being purchased by law enforcement bodies
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:38.400]  across the country with the aid of DHS funding shows a UAV spying on a private
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.360]  gun sale, falsely depicting the scenario as a criminal activity. That's how they do it,
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.360]  it's just like warfare, notice Paul gets that. It is important to emphasize
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.760]  that private firearm sales without background checks are not illegal under current law in the
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.560]  United States. Although gun control advocates are feverishly trying to change that with new
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:07.760]  legislation, the government claims that 40% of all gun sales are conducted without background checks.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.400]  And it goes into the Shadowhawk drone and Homeland Security is paying for thousands of these to be
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.280]  delivered to counties all over the country. In fact, a bunch of these have been delivered to
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:23.200]  Texas. In fact, this training video is from Texas. And he got this out quickly, he did a great job,
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:28.160]  he breaks down how it's all part of a huge arms build up, I'm gonna have Paul add to this.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.640]  Oh, look at that, it's Patriot types, they're,
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.600]  look, it's dressed like a good old boy. Look at that, he's wearing a dress like a Texan right
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.840]  there. All the training manuals, all the training videos, when the Marines train, they train to kill
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:50.160]  their daddy. Look at this, be advised, they are spying on the guy buying a handgun. This whole
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.040]  thing is for gun owners. And I'm gonna have Paul add the civilian inmate labor camp program into
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.280]  that. I'm gonna have him add all the military training to go after gun owners in that and the
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.840]  fact that they say the gun owners are the big target. I mean, this is all pointed at you,
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:11.200]  a huge arms build up against the American people. And they've got crosshairs on the folks that are
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:17.280]  buying the gun. So what's Homeland Security for? A gun confiscation, civil war in America.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:26.880]  Yeah, now he's showing him an AR-15.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.800]  Oh, this is so evil. Again, they're casting gun owners as criminals. I wanna bring Paul
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.040]  Watson up, we're going to break here in just a moment. Paul Watson, I mean, you add all this
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:43.360]  together, all these data points. I mean, this is crazy. And now they're saying today, you wrote
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.440]  another article, they wanna use these drones against us publicly. And they already are in
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.480]  places like North Dakota and in the Dorner case, Paul Watson.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.400]  Well, yeah, that was a lobbyist at a recent House committee hearing in Washington State.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:04.640]  And he basically admits, this is Paul Applewhite, whose company was founded to provide unmanned
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.160]  systems and training to government and industry. So he's in bed with them. And he basically says,
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:16.640]  not only have they been doing targeted killings abroad, because we know 5,000 people, most of them
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:22.560]  completely innocent, have been killed by armed drones. But they've been doing indiscriminate
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:28.320]  targeting of people abroad. So that's a new one. And then he advocates that police departments
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:35.840]  across the United States be given the power to use armed drones to conduct manhunts, like we saw
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:42.160]  with the Christopher Dorner thing. Absolutely, it's total militarization, total Pentagon takeover.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.160]  And who do they work for? The collaborators work for the foreign banks. And military,
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.080]  they're not gonna be military soon. It's all gonna be drones and robots. Here's the story
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:54.640]  right here. Activists launch campaign against autonomous weapons. Killer robots must be stopped.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:01.680]  Stay there, Paul Watson. We'll come back to you. Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:06.720]  to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free video
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:12.880]  presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:18.000]  what they really are, incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.760]  to keep your power bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have called
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.160]  it a cover-up. And you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:33.920]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.480]  and how you can beat them too. Watch the controversial video that thousands of other
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:44.160]  smart patriots have already seen in the last three months. Go to 123coverup.com and discover

[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.080]  They forced me to shut it down. Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.520]  It was the Carnivora that did it. And a lot of patients got better,
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.760]  ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.

[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:32.640]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks,

[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.280]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, if I rant and rave a bit, it's because
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:21.600]  if I saw people robbing and beating my neighbors, I'd get all upset and hop up and down like a wild
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:26.400]  dog. That's how you're supposed to act. I mean, you're supposed to get upset. That's why CNN
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:30.640]  hadn't had me back, because that was breaking people out of their trance. A lot of people,
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:36.000]  probably 30%, were very uncomfortable by it. Oh, my gosh, gun owners shouldn't be that upset
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.720]  and yell. That makes us look bad. And the media tried to spin it like that, but then backed off,
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.720]  because, no, wait a minute, they are trying to take our guns. They are lying. Here's Morgan's
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.200]  not being reasonable. He doesn't care about kids. He's exploiting them. That's outrageous.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:53.440]  You're going to start another revolution. People need to know the response they need to have.
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.000]  And it's the same thing with these drones. You're going to take our money and militarize
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.160]  everything when clearly you're preparing for war with the best people in this country,
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.480]  hardworking constitutionalist veterans and people like that. That's outrageous.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:11.360]  Where are the congressional investigations? Where are the arrests? Where are the impeachments?
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:19.120]  And now, the main helicopter, that's what it is, a medium-sized helicopter drone,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.080]  same one they crashed down, and Katie bought one and crashed it outside Houston.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.600]  They're buying tons of these for local departments. And one of the training videos
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.680]  and the advertisement, guys selling guns to each other. I mean, give me a break.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.480]  They're going to stop criminals having guns. It's the idea of gun owners being criminal.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:40.800]  The DHS targets all of it. Paul Watson, who broke this news at infoawards.com
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:46.720]  just 25 minutes ago, joins us. Paul, break down your take on this. And again, the calls
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.200]  in Congress by lobbyists and others, again, they're just getting us used to it for the
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:56.320]  Skynet drones. Go ahead. Well, this is a half a million dollar drone.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:01.280]  It's being funded by the Department of Homeland Security because they're paying for half of it
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.880]  when police departments buy it. So, they're putting forward $250,000.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.960]  It's a 50-pound mini helicopter. And according to the website of the makers,
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:17.360]  Vanguard Defense Industries, it can be fitted with tasers that can shoot barbs up to 100 feet.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.320]  It can be fitted with 12-gauge shotguns and grenade launchers.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:29.280]  So, while it depicts the American citizens as engaging in criminal activity for selling firearms,
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:34.800]  they're preparing to put firearms on these drones. And they've got people lobbying for
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.000]  them to be used domestically to hunt down suspects. So, then the police can become,
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.480]  you know, judge dread, judge jury and executioner inside the United States after they've already
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.640]  killed thousands and thousands of innocent people with armed drones abroad. But the comments are
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:58.640]  interesting, Alex, cuz you know, every time we put an article out, it's like fake. This is fake.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.600]  People said it about the shooting targets of pregnant women and children. The company later
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.040]  had to apologize. They said it about the 1.6 billion bullets,
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:11.840]  just like Gibbs was told, say there's no drones. It's just, this is a psy-op, yeah.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:18.320]  It's like confirmation bias in reverse, just anything to deny reality. And it's real. You
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.960]  can go on the Vanguard Industries website and that's their official YouTube channel. You can
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:27.120]  go on that and watch this same video clip, which is where I got it from. And then there's another
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:33.280]  one who says that the long rifle depicted in the clip is an SBR short-barreled rifle,
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.880]  which requires class three paperwork, meaning it is an SBR short-barreled rifle.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.560]  It requires class three paperwork, meaning it is illegal, and therefore it's perfectly reasonable.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:49.840]  Yeah, that's not true either. It's the short-barrel stuff is on shotguns. Unbelievable loads of bull.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:55.760]  It's the feds. It's sock puppets and feds crawling all over infoawars.com and prisonblunder.com.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.000]  And it's important to point them out and to go look up sock puppets. This is not a joke.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.040]  The Department of Defense admits they have hundreds of thousands of private contractors,
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.520]  hundreds of thousands engaging in domestic propaganda against the American people.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:15.040]  All of it illegal. Our government has taken over. It is illegitimate. Go ahead, Paul.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:23.600]  And it's all part of this slippery slope to approving, authorizing, justifying the use of
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:30.720]  armed drones against American citizens on US soil. CNN a couple of weeks ago, Erin Burnett,
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:35.520]  she was on the advocating armed drones be used against Christopher Dorna. And again,
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:41.040]  they'll use a test case like that who, you know, a cop killer to legitimize it.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.440]  And then eventually, you know, it's spying on gun owners as is depicted in this clip.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:53.120]  And the whole, the whole thing behind it is it links criminal clandestine activity with gun
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:58.720]  sales. So, yeah, they may be portrayed as criminals in this clip, but they're selling
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.120]  guns and they're making that association. That's the whole point. Meanwhile, the DHS is buying
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:09.520]  two billion rounds of ammo. They're buying 7000 fully automatic assault weapons and calling them
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:15.680]  personal defense weapons. And yet Americans are under suspicion for selling handguns privately.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:20.080]  So we know where this is all going. It's preparation for mass civil unrest.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:24.000]  That's why they're doing all this. Absolutely. I'm gonna say this very slowly for everyone.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.720]  I know most of you know this, but we've got to get this out to everybody. I'm gonna say it
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:33.280]  very slowly. In all the training manuals, the targets, the preparation, the target is law
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:40.560]  abiding citizens. The government is preparing for a Soviet style purge of the American people.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:47.760]  This is a red level emergency. The government is evil. Paul, stay there. I have a few more questions.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:56.480]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.240]  It all boils down to the food supply. Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.280]  food supply. Don't be dependent. Be self-sufficient. Don't wait for the government to feed you. Feed

[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:06.240]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity

[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:06.400]  saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says fool me once,
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:17.680]  shame on shame on you. Fool me, we can't get fooled again. He aligns himself with the truth
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:26.080]  and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:37.120]  I want to get your view as listeners on the giant arms build up, the memos going out to veterans
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:43.760]  to turn their guns in, the DHS memo saying they want total gun confiscation, the billions of
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:49.120]  rounds of ammo, the paper targets, the training manuals that gun owners, conservatives, libertarians
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:56.400]  are the enemy. I mean, this is like 1918 Russia. And if we follow the orders of this illegitimate
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:01.200]  criminal government, it's over. I mean, they are really horrible people. They plan on fully gutting
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:11.440]  this country. Told for a number to join us 800-259-9231, 800-25-99231. Paul, last week we
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.880]  aired part of a video, we'll play some more of it in a moment, with the Air Force showing a
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:22.000]  drone flying over and launching little drones that land on your power line and spy on you.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.200]  Well, that's what the smart meters already do. You just pay to have them put on the side of your
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:34.000]  house illegally. The boldness of this takeover, but it's accelerating for the collapse. I mean,
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.920]  does the system really think some drones and some spy systems? It's not gonna matter spying and
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:45.840]  having intel on people when they hate your guts and know you're a foreign occupier.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.360]  It doesn't matter. I get these calls about, my gosh, the military will get us the military.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.440]  We've already woke them up. The globalist couldn't hold Baghdad with 100,000 troops.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.600]  I'm sick of this. I mean, we'd have to be the most cowardly, pathetic people in the world
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:03.760]  to keep putting up with all this. But then I see the general public watching the Oscars and
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:06.560]  sucking their thumbs. I mean, it's quite a spectacle. Go ahead.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:12.480]  Well, I guess the people who matter, Alex, aren't gonna turn their guns in cuz they're
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:16.400]  not the people sucking their thumbs, are they? I mean, those people in Katrina,
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.320]  a lot of them turn their guns in. So it's whether people are delusional enough
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:24.320]  to believe the lie that it's for their safety, which is what they're gonna be told.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:30.400]  Well, you mentioned 1918 Russia. I put out an article on Friday with a Russian communist
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:36.880]  propaganda poster from 1918, where it says comrades turn your guns in, which of course
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:42.960]  is a chilling resemblance to the Dianne Feinstein quote. But I've noticed in the aftermath of your
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.720]  appearance on Piers Morgan, there's been this kind of meme on behalf of gun control advocates
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:54.880]  and status saying, and they've completely taken over the Google search results in this, saying
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:36:01.920]  Hitler never took the guns, Stalin never took the guns. They're trying to literally rewrite history
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:06.640]  to claim that tyrannical barbaric regimes in history did not engage in-
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:15.120]  Yeah, I saw your article and Salon and CNN, they've got the top links along with Nazi groups
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:19.920]  saying Hitler didn't take guns. Well, technically, Weimar Republic had gun restrictions on the books,
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:26.080]  then Hitler selectively enforced them. It is a load of crap that Hitler didn't take guns,
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.960]  not just in Germany, but all over occupied areas. And yes, you have all the liberal sites that are
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:37.840]  really authoritarians going, no one ever took guns for authoritarianism, absolute complete bull.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:47.120]  Well, Nazi weapons law, November 11, 1938, prohibited the Jews quote from acquiring,
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:53.760]  possessing, and carrying firearms and ammunition. That's the direct quote from Hitler's law.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:59.040]  So yeah, he took existing gun control laws, tightened them to a draconian level,
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:04.160]  and then put people in prison and killed them if they violated those laws. And then you had
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:10.160]  the Warsaw Ghetto, of course, which was only unsuccessful because the Jews did not have
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:15.760]  adequate access to firearms. And in fact, Goebbels wrote in his diary after the fact, quote,
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:22.400]  this just shows what you can expect from Jews if they lay hands-on weapons. And then you look at,
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.520]  as he said, 1918-
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:31.120]  No, no, no, Shallan and CNN and the Daily Beast, Hitler didn't take any guns. He was a nice guy,
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:37.600]  come on. And now you're gonna say Hitler was bad, Paul? I mean, you are a right-wing extremist.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.720]  Why don't you agree with Time Magazine that Hitler didn't take any guns?
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.680]  And Stalin was a nice fellow as well, apparently.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.480]  Oh, well, hey, hey, hey, let me show the article. Here it is. Communist propaganda
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:51.600]  poster comrades turn in your weapons, and it's on record they took the guns,
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:57.760]  but that doesn't exist because CNN says so. Okay, okay.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:05.440]  And in this article, I cite history books written by noted historians, and they talk about Stalin.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:11.040]  In 1918, the communist government banned private ownership of firearms. First,
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.920]  it was registration, then they banned them. The punishment was six months in prison.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:22.240]  Then Stalin comes along later, the punishment for possession of firearms by a private citizen
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:27.680]  who is not a Communist Party member is death. So to claim that Stalin, and of course,
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:32.720]  Stalin's model was mimicked in China and Cambodia. Same result, gun confiscation, mass genocide.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:37.840]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, there's no drones either. Paul, Paul, it's like ABC News,
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.680]  when they were here, they said nobody's calling for world government. And I showed them the clips,
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.640]  and they said that's a different world government. Everything's fine, Paul, come on.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:50.320]  And the shooting targets put out by the DHS contractor were all fake, they never existed.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:57.280]  It's ridiculous, the propaganda. But you're Bill Hicks, I'm a lizard,
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.160]  that's documented, that's important to discuss.
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:09.120]  Oh, it is entertaining, keep it coming, more please. Seriously, in closing here,
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:12.640]  and I'm gonna play a clip from this Air Force training video, and then play a clip from Ted
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:15.520]  Nugent with us yesterday when he called in. And then we're gonna go to your phone calls
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:20.560]  ahead of Mike Adams coming in studio. There's some type of diversion on the road, so maybe
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.680]  a little bit late, but Mike Adams breaking news coming up as well.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:28.560]  In closing, I just wanna say this, folks, support us. I wanna finish the new studios,
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.600]  I wanna do the satellite uplinks, I've got a bunch of money I gotta spend.
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.280]  And the more money comes into our operation, the more we can fight. And is there any place out
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:44.080]  there hitting the globalist harder every day than infowars.com? Yeah, drudgereport.com. And thank
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:49.120]  God they're carrying some of our news and helping magnify that as well. But when it comes to really
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:54.720]  fighting the globalist, we're the best there is. And we need your support. And we're able now to
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:00.400]  force this news out to get the other big talk show host to cover it. We're having major breakthroughs
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.600]  right now. So whether it's a ball cap, a camouflage, don't tread on me, infowars.com,

[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:50.960]  them because there's so much I wanna do. I mean, there's just so much. If we have the capital,
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:58.080]  we can do. And I know how bad the economy is as well. I know they're really trying to squeeze
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:02.560]  people out out there. So those of you that do have worth, those of you, your financial worth,
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:08.880]  those of you that do have the extra capital, you should be buying from us books, videos, materials,
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.520]  and giving them to others. Even if you're totally awake, you should be buying the Alex Jones
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:18.000]  everything special 20 something films. You should be getting all the other books and videos, the
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.080]  high quality water filters, all of it. Because not only do you get a great deal,
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.280]  you support the transmission and spread the word about the show as well.
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:27.040]  Paul Watson, anything else you'd like to add?
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:31.040]  No, that's it, Alex. Subscribe to prisonplanet.tv.

[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:05.120]  Thank you. All right, I'm gonna play a few minutes of this just because it was so interesting.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:08.800]  It was exciting. I mean, I've had Ted Nugent on probably 10 times over the years.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.560]  But Ted Nugent called into the show yesterday cuz he lives down here in Texas.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.680]  Every time I say that, people go, really, I thought he lives in Michigan.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.680]  He's got a place in Michigan too, but he lives here pretty much full time. I know folks that
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:23.920]  are friends with him and go shooting with him. He has a ranch north of Austin, in between Austin
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:30.800]  and Waco. So I don't know how else to explain that to people, but I assure you. And we're gonna
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:34.160]  be getting him on the show very, very soon. In fact, the date's already been set now.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:39.760]  They got back with us today. And so he's gonna break some information here on the show. I'll
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.320]  just leave it at that. We've got some other big guests tomorrow. Michael Savage is gonna be joining
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:49.440]  us. And then we've got other big breaking news we're working on. Well, there's a bunch of stuff
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:56.560]  this week. When it rains, it pours. And people are really waking up right now. And the quickening is
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.680]  happening, and more and more people are reaching out to us. Because they're like, man, I thought
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.800]  you're a little out there, but it's all happening. I don't deserve any credit. The globalists are
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.680]  all public about what they do. They just play these mind games of, no one ever took guns. No,
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:15.040]  they didn't take guns anywhere. People are like, are you sure, Alex? Cuz they say no guns were
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.120]  taken. Yeah, they said they didn't burn down Dorner. And I'm like, there's six different
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.960]  videos of them saying we're gonna burn the house down. Are you sure, Alex? They wouldn't lie.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:28.640]  Cuz they're lying about that, that means they're bad. And then that's kinda scary.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:34.400]  So I'll just say they don't lie to us. Folks, it's reaching a rotting point, a busting point.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.160]  And a flashpoint. Let's go ahead and go to a clip of this and then to your phone calls.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:46.080]  Here's Ted Nugent. And we're answering the phones in there, give the number out. First
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:51.600]  caller comes in, we open the phones up. It's Ted Nugent. Cuz our phones aren't just open on
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:56.160]  the Sunday show, it's a computerized phone system. You have to turn it on. He turns the
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.880]  phone system on. Boom, yeah, this is Ted Nugent driving in. I wanna come on, talk about what Alex
[01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:05.200]  is talking about and thanking. And so while I'm playing a video clip, I'm going, okay,
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:08.160]  asking, well, I think I tell the story here, so here it is.
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:14.800]  Now, I was down at the Piers Morgan thing in New York, but also in Houston in Katy a few weeks ago.
[01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:19.520]  They're covering it when he was down there. And I saw Ted Nugent drive through, waved at him. He
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:23.760]  rolled down the window and said, I'll kick their butt for you and drove in to the building where
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:29.600]  I've been earlier, there at the tactical firearms. And a fellow called in saying he was Ted Nugent,
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.920]  who's been on the show probably 10 times in the last 15 years or so. In fact, I've been trying
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:41.120]  to get him on lately. And somebody called in saying they're Ted Nugent. And I said, okay,
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:44.640]  ask him, cuz I don't have time, I couldn't talk to him just now and run out there and find out who
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:49.200]  they are and make sure it's Ted. I said, ask him what he drove into the Piers Morgan thing in
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:56.000]  Houston in. And he said, my pilot's cruddy gray SUV. So it's either Ted Nugent or it's somebody
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.520]  that was there and knew. So I'm very excited to get Uncle Ted on with us. If it's Uncle Ted,
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:03.680]  I'll recognize his voice. Is that Uncle Ted?
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:19.680]  Alex, greetings from the Self-Evident Truth Army that supports everything you do, man.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.920]  I'm calling in to say thank you.
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:26.480]  No, I wanna thank you. Hey, I know you're a busy guy, but when can I get you on the show?
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:31.280]  We need to do it soon. I'm really, really busy these days. I just happen to have a wonderful
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:36.480]  dinner with my daughter in Houston. I got in my truck on my way back home to Waco. And I heard
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.480]  you coming on the air with the new telephone number, so I dialed it. I figured I'd just jump
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.960]  in and say hello. Well, listen, can you do maybe 10 minutes with us while you're driving?
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:50.080]  Yeah, I think as long as I got a signal, I'd be more than happy to. Cuz what you're celebrating
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:56.800]  and what you're sharing with the radio listeners out there is indisputable, it's irrefutable.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:03.760]  And I gotta thank you because it's so late in coming that those of us with the balls and the
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:11.040]  inside view of the criminality of this government right now, the unprecedented abuse of power and
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:16.320]  corruption and fraud and deceit by the Chicago gangster scammer Acorn and Chief.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.880]  It's so diabolical that I just wanted to say thank you from the trenches.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.280]  Please don't thank me, sir. We wanna get your take.
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:31.280]  Absolutely, and there's 18 minutes more of it up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. But
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.000]  he said he's gonna break some info here on the show very, very soon and he has been set back up
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.800]  for the show. But it conflicts with another interview I'm doing, so we're gonna tape it.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.880]  But anyways, we're gonna get him back on the broadcast. Very exciting to have that happen.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:50.960]  Things are always fun when they're a surprise. That's why I always surprise people with news
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:56.640]  or big gas cuz I like surprises. Some people don't like surprises. My lawyer calls me or
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:02.000]  something. I don't like those kind of surprises. But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.240]  For those of you that have been patiently holding the last few minutes,
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:11.280]  let's go and talk to Zachary. No, no, Joe in California is first, then Zachary.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.160]  Joe in California, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:17.680]  Good afternoon, Alex. You're doing God's work and I salute you.
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:18.720]  Well, thank you, brother. Go ahead.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:25.040]  I wanna talk to you about drones on two brief issues. One, there is a good use for drones.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.240]  I say we fly one into the Bohemian Grove on the cremation of care and break up their little
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:38.080]  ceremony. We've actually talked about doing that. And believe me, the Secret Service would probably
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:42.960]  go completely wild on you about that. But hey, you're watching us. Aren't these the crooks that
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:48.480]  need to be washed? You make a really good point. Well, the nice thing is it sends the footage back
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.280]  to your smartphone. So even if they took down the unmanned aerial device, we would still have
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:57.760]  the footage. And they can take one of us down. But if we send in those drones every single year-
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:02.400]  Well, that's why they're saying, we'll protect you from the drones. We need state and federal laws,
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:07.840]  which then ban citizens having drones so only the establishment can. It's like, we'll deal
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.400]  with congressional insider trading. And then they legalize it, claiming they criminalized it when
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:17.120]  it was already illegal. Go ahead. They need to know there's nowhere they can hide. And the second
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:22.880]  issue I wanted to bring up just briefly, I know it's important that you have good relations with
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:27.840]  anybody, especially Michael Savage. He has a huge audience. However, I hope that you can respectfully
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:34.400]  hold his feet to the fire with his take on drones. Just last week, he mocked his audience for their
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:40.480]  mistrust of the Obama administration and Eric Holder. He supports the legal case for using
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.840]  drone strikes on Americans. He supports the official story of Anwar al-Awlaki. He never
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:50.000]  mentioned the fact that Anwar al-Awlaki dined at the Pentagon. He doesn't talk about the shoe
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.280]  bomber, the underpants bomber, the Fort Hood shooter. He calls his listeners knee-jerk,
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:59.840]  neo-cons, and nervous-nelly media conservatives because they question Eric Holder.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:07.360]  Well, let me just be clear. I didn't hear him say all that. But I'm getting him on about his book.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:14.240]  And my issue is, he didn't say, hey, don't ask me tough questions. But when somebody asks,
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.880]  well, what do you want me on about? And then I'm honest with them what it's about.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:22.800]  I'm not gonna sneak attack somebody on my show. I'll ask him if he wants to take some phone calls.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.600]  I mean, maybe you can call in then. But see, I can't just say, hey, you said this and that.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.840]  I'm not saying you're lying. But it might be your interpretation as well. I just can't go off of
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:37.600]  what you say. But I'm gonna get Savage on. All I know is Savage talked about Obama staging false
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:43.520]  flags, Obama's domestic army, Obama coming after the guns, the New World Order. Of all the big
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:47.840]  mainline talk show hosts out there, I mean, I think Savage is the best. I know that Savage
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:53.200]  doesn't work behind the scenes to try to shut my show down and cause it problems and mess
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:50:01.040]  with sponsors and things like someone else does. And so my whole issue is, he's not an empty suit.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:07.760]  And I work with WorldNetDaily. He works with them. And so we'll see what happens tomorrow.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:12.480]  But I'm not gonna, it's not that I'm gonna do sit here and do a softball interview. I've got
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.520]  him coming on about the big threat, the New World Order, Obama, all this other stuff.
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:23.440]  But send me emails, send me the facts on what you're saying there. Cuz so much stuff that ends
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:28.560]  up being said about Savage, you go look it up and it's not true. Or it's a forgery or it's twisted.
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:34.320]  I mean, I had some guy walk up to me this weekend while I'm eating with my family at a restaurant
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:37.920]  and say he was a fan. But I could tell by the way he was looking at me. I was like,
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:41.040]  every once in a while it happens. And he's like, how do I know you're not with the government or
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:45.280]  whatever? And I'm like, hey, man, leave whatever you want. It's a cop out to sit there and ask,
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:51.920]  cuz it puts people, puts them on a moral high horse. Like, I'm questioning you with no proof.
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:58.400]  If somebody's got the proof of something wrong I've done, bring it, okay? I'm here fighting
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:04.880]  tyranny, it's obvious. Weekend by GMO stressed out about money and blasted by the electric
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:10.720]  environment. Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then I learned
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:16.800]  about RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:21.520]  packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells,
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:26.720]  organs, and other tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:32.560]  like I'd been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:37.840]  to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health and joy. Learn more about RNA

[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:38.240]  Then just get him on here and try to act like I've got a bigger, you know what than he does.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:41.680]  See, I'm not in competition with people.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.640]  I told him that on the phone, he didn't really bring that subject up, but it came up one way.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:56.720]  And I mean, I want this country back, I want this world back. I don't wanna give in to total
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:00.800]  tyranny. I mean, this is life and death for me, cuz I know the score. This is not about
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:06.960]  who's number one or who's on the most stations. If I wanted to do that, folks, I would have
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:17.600]  taken the deal and been the next Glenn Beck. TV deals, the books, all of it, I was offered
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:23.600]  the exact same thing. And two years later, Glenn Beck came along. And that's how it works.
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:29.840]  These radio executives go out and find people that they think can do certain things and then
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:35.200]  they create shows and then program them. And I was told the same thing four different times
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:38.640]  by different high level executives, different companies, the same story.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:44.720]  How you don't have to worry, we will show you how to be number one,
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:51.360]  and this is what we're going to do. And that just does not interest me. Changing history
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:56.160]  for the better interests me. Standing up against evil, not having this nightmare New World Order
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:00.000]  takeover. I mean, if most people working for the system, most of them aren't bad.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.600]  They're just sellouts, ladder climbers. What they don't know is that ladder that goes into the
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:13.440]  clouds, that cloud isn't water vapor, it's nerve gas. They think they're climbing up to the magic
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:19.120]  castle with the gold. And they're not, they're climbing up a globalist ladder into a very bad
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:24.640]  place. See, I don't wanna go up that ladder. I want to get out of this system. I wanna change
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:30.800]  things. And I know history, I know I can do it with your help. I know you have power.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.000]  And if you knew what I knew, I mean, if you knew I'm not just making all this up,
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.040]  if you'd go research what I'm saying, and a lot of you have done that, you'd understand,
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:44.880]  of course, he's not selling out. He knows history. I mean, if these globalists weren't
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:49.520]  absolutely pure evil, I probably would have compromised in more ways just to get into
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:53.760]  the power structure with the old thing of work from within. Something this bad,
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:58.880]  you cannot compromise with it. Trying to explain this to people.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.960]  There's no pragmatic way out of this, okay? You've gotta have a clean break with these people
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:10.480]  and really get what's happening. And all of us just have to start saying no in different ways.
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:15.200]  And you can see us turning the momentum. That's why the system's accelerating the takeover right
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:21.360]  now. I know we got loaded phones. Mike Adams is coming in about 15 minutes. We'll go to a Brian
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:27.440]  and Zachary and Brendan and Tim and everybody when we come back.
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:30.160]  So I'm going to break. It's too late to go to calls right now. It's just
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:34.560]  that caller asked those questions and then I'm thinking, well,
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:44.400]  you know, what kind of questions should I ask Savage? Cuz see, it wasn't even in my mind
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:48.080]  that, I'm going to do a softball interview. I never even thought like that. I'm like a
[01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:51.920]  hunting dog. I'm on my trail. That's what I'm doing. I was thinking,
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:58:01.360]  I was thinking, how do I get Michael Savage to come on regularly to talk about things that he
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:05.600]  thinks are important? Cuz it will add a richness to the broadcast and bring in Michael Savage
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.160]  listeners. And then my listeners will go over to Michael Savage. And then we will change Michael
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:16.080]  Savage, I believe in the long run. But reality will change people. But that's not even the
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:22.400]  overall goal. The overall goal is to talk about issues and get his perspective about how China
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:27.120]  has become our owner by the globalist traders manipulating us in that position. See, I'm
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:34.160]  worried about the big threat on the planet. I'm not worried about, you know, showing someone up
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:47.760]  cuz I'm the big man. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com today.

[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:10.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.320]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.440]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:24.480]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:38.800]  All right, into hour number three, Mike Adams will be arriving in the next 10-15 minutes.
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:41.800]  Key breaking news with him, got a whole list of it here.
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:42.960]  Here's some of the news we've got.
[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:45.880]  Pasture plans, toy gun buyback program.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:50.840]  See, the idea is guns themselves are bad, instead of guns being something to protect
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:55.720]  you from a rattlesnake, something to go hunting to get you food, it's dangerous, but kids
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:57.320]  gotta learn things are dangerous.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:01.840]  The problem is you got people that never been around gun culture now getting guns, and their
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:06.220]  four-year-old picks it up and shoots themselves.
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:10.840]  Just amazing, but see, it's the idea of, it's of the Lord to turn your gun in, it's of the
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:14.880]  Lord to roll over to evil, totally unbiblical.
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:18.480]  The Pharisees were planning to set Christ up, and he wasn't ready to be killed yet,
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:21.640]  so he turned the other cheek to make the guy look like a fool.
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:26.840]  See, everything in there is about the particular story and time, it's like a handbook on how
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:30.600]  to behave, and it's all varied.
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:34.200]  But I guess the average dumbbell out there, kid doesn't know how to understand the Bible,
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:37.080]  which saddens me, that's why they want you dumbed down.
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:41.680]  Let's talk to Brian in Mass, gold in the economy is what you called in about, welcome.
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:46.080]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to touch upon your last comments.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:49.920]  I agree though, you're with Michael Savage, he's a good guy overall, compared to all the
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:50.920]  rest of the radios.
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:55.400]  He's no Mark Levin, he's no Sean Hannity, I think he's just, he's a good guy.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:00.240]  So I wouldn't doubt that you have to go Ann Coulter on him or anything like that.
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:04.560]  Now that's somebody I'd like to get on is Ann Coulter, bad-mouthing libertarians saying
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:07.200]  the Japanese ought to be thankful for Fukushima.
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:11.720]  I mean, again, she just says outlandish stuff to get attention.
[02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:16.520]  It's one thing if you say outlandish stuff that's real to get attention to the problem,
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:20.700]  I'm all for publicity if it's real, life is sensational.
[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:26.700]  But my issue with Ann Coulter is, since you bring her up, is that she's just always saying
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:29.160]  really stupid stuff, go ahead.
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:35.240]  No, I mean, when you entered back in 2002, I mean, you tried to be nice to her, but I
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:37.840]  mean, she said she didn't care about the Second Amendment.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:44.640]  She had no interest towards actual civil liberties, the only thing she said she was concerned
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.200]  with was the war on, quote unquote, terrorism.
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:52.840]  No, it's a fake lawyer response, and that shows the hysteria they had when they staged
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:57.000]  9-11, was that I don't care about the Second Amendment anything, I'll do anything.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  Yeah, I'd forgotten she said that.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.360]  Get rid of everything to fight the terrorists that the government publicly runs, which is
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.840]  admitted, but I'm not supposed to talk about it like it's rude if I bring that up.
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:12.880]  The stupid al-Qaeda is being used to take our liberties, we're the target, not al-Qaeda.
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:18.720]  That's right, and when you said, well, what about George Bush after the Second Amendment,
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:22.480]  she said that's not a concern to me, nothing's a concern, nothing's a concern, the only thing
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.540]  that you have to be worried about- No, no, no, no, these pundits that the establishment
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:32.660]  pushes are good at just putting out arguments, and people think they put out dumb arguments
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:38.080]  because they're talking to a dumbed down population, that's the chicken and the egg deal.
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:44.360]  The dumbing the argument down is what dumbs you down, it's not that they dumb it down
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:49.200]  because you're dumb, they dumb it down to make you dumb, and now they have made us dumb,
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.240]  but we can reverse that, you see what I'm saying?
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:56.820]  Absolutely, that's what I actually- And by the way, she sounds like a genius compared
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:04:01.820]  to an MSNBC person, cuz you see, there's stuff like Ann Coulter and clowns like her, they're
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:07.480]  not even on the radar screen, man, I mean, the stuff on MSNBC and CNN, now that is dangerous,
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:12.640]  I mean, that is just, I turn it on and I'm like, am I actually seeing this crap where
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:17.080]  they sit there and there's no world government, there's no drones, there's no corruption,
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:22.760]  Alex Jones is bad, he said they said burn it down, he's helping Dorner, he loves Dorner,
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:27.720]  I mean, it is just a pack of lying, knuckle dragging enemies.
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:32.200]  Oh yeah, and you're a racist, you know what I mean, either way, right?
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:35.960]  Yeah, it's like, hey, I don't want socialism, right, I mean, it's like, what does it even
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:36.960]  mean?
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:41.040]  What does it, yeah, that's the, they do a thing that's called a good distraction, it's
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:44.120]  the effect- No, it's all about, it's like a squid shooting
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:49.500]  ink at you, exactly, in fact, that's the new liberal defense thing, is a pair of scissors
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:53.160]  against a gun or to crap on yourself, did you see that last week?
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:54.160]  I did.
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:58.720]  They're being raped, vomit or urinate on people, liberals are now like squid, they're going
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.360]  to projectile crap on us.

[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:50.920]  us, I will get to more of your calls from Tim and Zachary and everybody else that's
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:58.680]  holding, Mike Adams is here in studio with us, thehealthrangernaturalnews.com and Friday,
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:02.040]  are you still set to guest host for me?
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:05.200]  I actually plan on being here, it's just I've got so much to get done, I have to actually
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:09.480]  take off to get stuff done, just like I know you have to, hey, you brought a Barrett 50
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:11.320]  cal mag in here.
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:16.800]  Well yeah, I figure there's all this talk about reducing the size, the capacity of magazines
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:23.000]  and so if it comes down to a 10 round limit, these are the 10 rounds that I want, Barrett
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  50 cal.
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.320]  And it looks like you've got the actual army version there, you've got the tan one?
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:34.040]  This is from the M107A1 flat dark earth, 29 inch barrel magazine, this is the new improved
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:35.880]  magazine over the 82 model.
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.560]  Yeah, cuz you can actually see the numbers there.
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:40.880]  So go Barrett, I tell you.
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:42.560]  I'm all about going Barrett.
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:47.480]  Yeah, even seven rounds in here would still be effective, wouldn't you say?
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:49.920]  Yeah, I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:54.640]  What, I don't have a rifle, I just have a magazine, what are you talking about?
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:55.960]  No, yeah, it's awesome.
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:59.920]  It's addicting shooting them, you don't wanna go back to anything else.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:04.880]  It's a masterful piece of machinery, it's a work of art, it's great stuff.
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:09.020]  Hey, how obvious does it have to get with the 2 billion rounds of ammo, the veterans
[02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:14.760]  getting letters for gun confiscation, the official Justice Department recommending confiscating
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:20.560]  everything, the army training to take on gun owners, and the main company with these many
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.840]  helicopters that are hundreds of thousands of dollars a piece, that the first time they
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:26.720]  launched one in Houston, it crashed.
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:31.060]  Just 400,000 bucks though, 200,000 Homeland Security, 200,000 of our money.
[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:34.680]  And the county's everywhere buying them with grenade launchers, shotgun mounts, and they're
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:39.560]  just announcing war on us, and they'll just write more old ladies tickets to do it.
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.560]  They're going completely nuts, I mean, and it's all happening.
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:48.680]  Well, the thing that really gets under my skin, Alex, is that they sign up people to
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:52.280]  join the military and say, well, we're gonna train you.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.760]  And part of the message is we're gonna train you to be a killer, we're gonna train you
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:58.480]  to be aggressive, we're gonna train you to be a tactical-
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:01.400]  You must not hesitate or you will be dead, Marine.
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:05.360]  But then they say, then they twist it, the catch-22, they twist it and say, well, what
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:10.180]  we trained you to be, well, that's a mental illness.
[02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:14.040]  And so now we're gonna send you home and say you're mentally ill because you were trained
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:15.040]  in the way-
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:18.900]  And by the way, when we confirmed it, they're CPSing guys that have their legs and arms
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:22.760]  blown off, the wife's working, they go, and you're mentally ill too, never in the military.
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:26.840]  We're taking your kids, your guns, they are abusing them, and the cover story is that
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:30.120]  the NFL and everywhere, we love the troops, we love the troops.
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:32.480]  That's the cover that they hate them and are going after them.
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:35.960]  Mental illness is the new medical fascism in America.
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:40.460]  They can use mental illness to take away not only your gun rights, but also your First
[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:41.460]  Amendment rights.
[02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:46.280]  What's to stop them from saying, if your diagnosis is mentally ill, you can't have a website,
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:50.040]  you can't exercise your First Amendment or your Second Amendment, what's to say you don't
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:51.040]  even have a Fifth Amendment?
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:55.280]  Well, you know about in their new handbook, well, that's like school nurses and teachers
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:01.540]  prescribing Prozac, Ritalin, those are the old drugs, the new drugs as well, with never
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:02.540]  even a doctor's visit.
[02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:06.080]  I mean, it's enough if you went to the fake psychiatrist and they did a diagnosis, it's
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:07.080]  just totally fake.
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:11.800]  Remember when Prozac and now other families of drugs do free mail outs of samples?
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:12.800]  Oh, yeah.
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:13.800]  It's a hallucinogen.
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:14.800]  Yeah.
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:19.680]  I mean, the thing that really gets me is that veterans, when they do a couple tours in war
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:21.840]  and they come home, they're wiser.
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:23.400]  They wise up to things.
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:24.400]  They get informed.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:25.720]  They come home, they're smarter.
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:30.040]  They know a little bit more about globalism and why the wars are really being fought and
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:31.080]  what's going on.
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:37.520]  They learn about the VA, how the VA hospitals just abuse or are negligent.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:42.160]  That's because the veterans are seen as evil demons that are dangerous.
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:43.160]  Oh, right.
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:44.840]  And that hates the vets.
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:45.840]  Absolutely.
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:48.960]  And then, of course, but the government says, oh, we all have to stand up and salute and
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:50.200]  play the Star Spangled Banner.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.220]  Let's honor the vets.
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:52.220]  That's their public thing.
[02:12:52.220 --> 02:12:53.220]  And I agree.
[02:12:53.220 --> 02:12:54.220]  Let's honor the vets.
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:55.840]  But let's honor them after they come home.
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:58.540]  Let's honor them with VA- But, Mike, don't you see?
[02:12:58.540 --> 02:12:59.540]  It's the cover.
[02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:04.160]  All the over the top troop this, troop that on every show, every company.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:05.160]  Yeah.
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:07.460]  Even the companies themselves may actually be buying into it.
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:12.040]  But the push to do this is the weird cover where the troops are being told they're loved
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:15.240]  to get new people to join like it's the coolest thing in the world.
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:18.680]  And then while they're actually abusing them, it doesn't fit with the script.
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:22.960]  So even though vets are having their kids taken, drugged, attacked, their guns taken,
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:26.040]  all this happening, it doesn't compute.
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:27.040]  It's a smokescreen.
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:28.160]  They're being exploited.
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:32.040]  They're being used and then thrown out like an old doll or something.
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.560]  They're just being used and thrown away and then stripped of their rights.
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:39.240]  Now, the veterans are the people who should have the Second Amendment rights more than
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:40.240]  anybody in America.
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:41.240]  Why are you an extremist?
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:42.240]  I mean, come on.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:45.720]  Vets shouldn't be able to own guns and the government loves us.
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:49.880]  I think more vets need more of these right here, these 50 Cal Barrett.
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:50.880]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:53.440]  They also sell an idea that no one can ever be killed.
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:54.640]  There can never be accidents.
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:56.040]  There can never be a problem.
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:58.780]  The truth is the world's a violent, crazy place.
[02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:04.000]  And anytime they say collectively a whole group's bad because statistically a few people
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.720]  might do something wrong.
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:11.100]  That is classical authoritarianism where somebody does something wrong in the town show everybody
[02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:12.360]  has to go do forced labor.
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:13.520]  Well, look, let me be clear.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:15.680]  I'm with the vets 100 percent.
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:19.240]  And if it comes down to a shooting war in this country, which we hope never happens,
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:20.400]  we want to avoid that.
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:21.400]  The government wants it.
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:22.400]  The government wants it.
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:27.160]  But can you imagine the gun grabbing liberals versus the armed veterans?
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:28.160]  Who's going to win that fight?
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:29.800]  I'm with the vets, man.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:33.080]  Well, our problem is they're going to pull psy up that they're going to kill innocent
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:34.080]  people.
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:37.800]  They're going to attack large concentrations of children and then have a computer morph
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:41.640]  of patriots saying, you know, Mike Adams or Alex Jones killed the children.
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.400]  And folks need to know that's not real.
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:44.400]  That'll never happen.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:46.380]  You got to know the government's evil.
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:47.760]  They're far and run.
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.120]  Anything they put out's a lie.
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:50.120]  They're the enemy.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.120]  But none of it.
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:52.120]  It's pure BS.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:56.920]  It's like Tokyo Rose saying that Japan had won the war, even as atomic bombs were being
[02:14:56.920 --> 02:14:57.920]  detonated.
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:58.920]  OK, it's pure bull.
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:14:59.920]  Yeah.
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:02.920]  And I wouldn't be surprised if I were to digitize your face and your voice and they've got it
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:06.440]  ready to go like messages from Alex Jones that are completely fabricated.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:11.440]  Of course, you know, CG, you know, Hollywood graphics at your service right there.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:12.440]  They can look.
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:13.520]  We know they're the enemy.
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:14.520]  It's done.
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:16.680]  No matter what they do, it's pure bull, folks.
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:17.680]  Absolutely.
[02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:18.680]  Absolutely.
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:20.600]  Well, what do you think about the Dorner situation?
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:24.920]  I mean, they say burn that mother down, burn that effort down, burn down the house.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:26.240]  OK, we're placing the burners.
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:27.240]  We have fire.
[02:15:27.240 --> 02:15:28.240]  It's burned down.
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:29.240]  Mission complete.
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:32.280]  Well, we're doing a parody video on that with Billy Joel song.
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:35.680]  We didn't start the fire with being sung by the LAPD.
[02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:38.240]  It'll be out this week.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:40.280]  We didn't start the fire.
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:41.280]  It's been burned.
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:43.740]  And it's also Bill Clinton singing that over Waco.
[02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:44.740]  And it's got.
[02:15:44.740 --> 02:15:45.740]  We didn't start the fire.
[02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:46.740]  That's it.
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:47.740]  It's been burned.
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:49.040]  And since the world was turning.
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:50.040]  Yep.
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:52.640]  So we've got we're doing a parody on that because, you know, the globalists hate to
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:53.900]  be made fun of.
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:55.160]  That's that's the one thing.
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:56.160]  Yeah.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:57.160]  Yeah.
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:58.160]  We have drones.
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:15:59.160]  We have troops.
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:00.160]  We have black uniforms.
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:01.160]  Yeah.
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:02.160]  Your black uniform doesn't scare me.
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.160]  It makes me want to stomp your butt.
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:04.160]  Yeah.
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.160]  It's scary what they think they can get away with.
[02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:09.800]  I just talked about it yesterday about the armed raids of raw milk.
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:10.800]  Raw milk producers.
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:13.800]  You know, James Stewart's been a guest here on your show.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:15.000]  That doesn't happen in China.
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.680]  That doesn't happen in North Korea, doesn't happen in Cuba.
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:22.220]  They don't they don't take guns to farmers and say, give us your raw milk or force them
[02:16:22.220 --> 02:16:23.780]  to pour it down the drain.
[02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:29.540]  Only in America is the government using these assault weapons, true full auto assault rifles
[02:16:29.540 --> 02:16:36.400]  like the DHS has just bought 7000 more to go against food and nutrition and to act like
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:37.400]  it's all evil.
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:38.400]  It's all dress up.
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:42.240]  Well, it's all behaving as if we did a year and a half sting of the Amish who were publicly
[02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:45.360]  selling milk to their neighbors that begged who were a fake family.
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:49.600]  No, that they did that to act like it was something dirty for the moron jury.
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:54.400]  Well, no, James Stewart was was distributing raw milk, mostly to mothers who couldn't breastfeed.
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:56.760]  And they were they were feeding the raw milk to their babies.
[02:16:56.760 --> 02:16:57.760]  So evil.
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:02.440]  When they came in and took that food and destroyed it over $50,000, those babies went hungry
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:03.440]  that day.
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:04.440]  Good.
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:05.440]  They need shots.
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:06.440]  Babies don't need food.
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:07.920]  They need mercury shots.
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:11.960]  And he's still facing sentencing, by the way, in L.A. County, I believe, you know, it's
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:14.320]  not over for James Stewart.
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:19.560]  I mean, that that that guy is the unsung hero of the food freedom movement, and no one will
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:22.280]  I think is I think is I think his organs should be harvested.
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:25.320]  Well, they practically tried to do that to him in L.A.
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:27.320]  No, I mean, I say execute him in his entire.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:29.600]  I mean, I think I think the government's God.
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:34.440]  I think you're a sick person that that well, that that kind of approach may be coming soon
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:36.240]  from I love Stalin.
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:39.840]  Yeah, well, give him one of these.
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:44.640]  Hey, hey, have you heard the media Hitler and Stalin and Mao didn't take any guns?
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:45.940]  Have you heard that?
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:49.000]  They're now saying we're liars and Google has gained the search results.
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:56.800]  I am aware that there is an attempt at a truly a hypnotic amnesia being put cast like a spell
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:17:57.800]  on the people.
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:17:58.800]  I'm not joking.
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.800]  This is about satire.
[02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:00.800]  There is hypnosis.
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:01.800]  No, no, no.
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:02.800]  They're worried that we'll go wait.
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:03.920]  They took the guns before.
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:04.920]  And this happens.
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:05.920]  Yeah.
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:07.080]  And so they're going into Alex.
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:10.960]  There's actually saying Alex lied to you on Piers Morgan, Hitler, Stalin and Mao did not
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:11.960]  take the guns.
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:12.960]  Right, right.
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:16.560]  Well, there is no greater hypnotist in politics today than Obama.
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:19.520]  He's a hypnotic speaker, better than Clinton ever was.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:22.640]  And Clinton was a brilliant how dare you answer.
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:28.560]  But Obama is even better, a better master of neurolinguistic programming and hypnotic
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:29.560]  language.
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:30.560]  That why I love him?
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:31.560]  It must be.
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:32.560]  It must be.
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:33.560]  I love Obama.
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:34.560]  Why are you hurting him?
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:39.720]  You know, when I've taken the Obama callers, sometimes they call in desperate going, you're
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:40.720]  horrible liar.
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:41.720]  Why are you doing this?
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:42.960]  Don't you talk about it.
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:43.960]  And they're real people.
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:44.960]  We've put them on hold.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:45.960]  Is this a joke?
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:46.960]  And they're like, no, you devil.
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:47.960]  No, you devil.
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:49.200]  I actually believe it.
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:52.520]  He's like raping the poor, just just annihilating them.
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:54.520]  Then when is the apology coming to you?
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:57.720]  Because you warned about the drones and they called you a kook for saying they're gonna
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:58.720]  be drones in the sky.
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:02.260]  Now it's it's it's now they're like death panels are good, right?
[02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:03.360]  What about the NDAA?
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:04.720]  You warned about the NDAA.
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:05.720]  It wasn't hard.
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:06.800]  Obama played possum.
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:07.840]  He signed it on what?
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:09.020]  New Year's Eve, right?
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:10.020]  When no one was.
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:11.020]  Maybe he didn't sign it.
[02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:12.020]  Let's just say he didn't.
[02:19:12.020 --> 02:19:13.020]  Well, he robo signed it.
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:14.020]  Government.
[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:15.020]  Oh, government.
[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:16.020]  Look, government loves me.
[02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:18.300]  Did you hear about how Gibbs came out and said we were told to just say drones don't
[02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:19.300]  exist?
[02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:20.300]  Yeah, right.
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:21.300]  Don't exist.
[02:19:21.300 --> 02:19:22.300]  Right, right.
[02:19:22.300 --> 02:19:24.320]  I mean, that's everything you've talked about right here at it for.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:30.240]  But it shows how it's meant to be over the top where you're just standing there.
[02:19:30.240 --> 02:19:34.240]  Things are so insane today in terms of reality manipulation.
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:38.120]  I think, you know, I like the fact that you've talked to David Icke recently because David
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:44.260]  talks about the reality shaping and, you know, multidimensional, you know, people moving
[02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:45.260]  in and out of realities.
[02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:49.440]  I don't know if that's literal or metaphorical, but reality is being twisted by people like
[02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:51.640]  Gibbs, people like Obama, people like Clinton.
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:54.520]  Well, that's what that's what Karl Rove said.
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:57.680]  He said we control reality and we'll change it tomorrow and you will do what we do as
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:58.680]  we're told.
[02:19:58.680 --> 02:19:59.680]  And the media said, yes, sir.
[02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:01.720]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams.
[02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:03.200]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:05.040]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:07.420]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:09.120]  What can you not live without?
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:10.760]  What is your greatest dependency?
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:11.760]  Is it your guns?
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:12.760]  Is it your home?
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:14.120]  No, it's food.
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:16.240]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:19.960]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:20.960]  Don't be dependent.
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:21.960]  Be self-sufficient.
[02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:23.840]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:24.840]  Feed yourself.
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:27.080]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:30.320]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.

[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:03.600]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:07.120]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:11.080]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:15.840]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry and
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:16.840]  my guns.
[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:19.840]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:25.240]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that deadbolts
[02:21:25.240 --> 02:21:27.400]  alone don't stop intruders.
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:31.760]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually
[02:21:31.760 --> 02:21:33.440]  stop an intruder.
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:38.440]  Easy Armor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent
[02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:39.440]  kick-ins.

[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:35.200]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:36.200]  IRAs?
[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:40.220]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:41.920]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:45.400]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:50.400]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:11.760]  were still selling them almost 30 years later.

[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:12.560]  Well I tell you ladies and gentlemen, we got Mike Adams here with us.
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:13.840]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:17.800]  All right Mike, you came in here to get into some really big breaking health news that
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:22.560]  is so important but first off, tell the TV viewers but describe it for radio listeners
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:27.020]  about Obama Bites made in China.
[02:24:27.020 --> 02:24:29.720]  What is this and go over the ingredients.
[02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:30.720]  Did you come up with this?
[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:33.880]  Yeah, you know, I always like to bring a little bit of satire with me in the studio but so
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:40.160]  we have a new nutritional product formulated by Obama called Obama Bites daily chewable
[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:46.080]  multivitamin and it's got all sorts of trace minerals in it that you can see here including
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:47.400]  obamnesium.
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:52.720]  You know a lot of supplements have magnesium and zinc but this has obamnesium which causes
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:56.160]  you to forget history all the way back to 1776.
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:59.120]  So you forget American history.
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:05.640]  This mineral is really powerful, squeezium, that helps the TSA do its job better, squeezium.
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:08.080]  That's a nice trace mineral there.
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:14.400]  We've got hypnolium, dystopian and even fukushemium for extra energy for your cells and culture
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:15.400]  agrees with that.
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:16.400]  Yeah, she does.
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:18.720]  No, she should take this.
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:19.720]  Take some Obama Bites.
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:23.120]  She said the Japanese should be thankful for their children dying of radiation.
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:26.320]  Yes, we've got radon in here.
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.160]  That's useful for raw milk because the government conducts a raid on raw milk.
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:36.520]  Well, plus they mine the stuff for the fluoride out of the uranium mine so it actually has
[02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:37.720]  radon and stuff in it.
[02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:38.720]  Yes, it does.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:43.920]  Yes, and this is of course made in China and it's probably all GMO but it's not listed
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:44.920]  on the label.
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:48.680]  No, all I care about is that it not be organic.
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:50.520]  Obviously GMO is what you need.
[02:25:50.520 --> 02:25:54.880]  Apparently, but anyway, I'll leave that here for the studio in case you guys want to have
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:56.440]  fun.
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:00.700]  And the great part about it is there's too many people so it'll, what reduces your life
[02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:02.880]  you were saying like at least 30, 40 years.
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:08.740]  Oh yeah, and plus we've got the finestinium mineral in here so that you live under tyranny.
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:12.560]  Actually that was a government experimental mineral that was used to see if they could
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:17.360]  turn a female gargoyle into a US senator and they were successful.
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.760]  Man, that stuff's incredible.
[02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:22.120]  Am I going overboard here with this?
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:23.120]  No, I think this is awesome.
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:29.960]  I mean, I'm realizing, can you have like Obama bites plus letter that has like stalinizium?
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:31.560]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:34.880]  Sure, we can have version two, version three, you name it.
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:39.120]  This will probably be USDA approved for the school lunch program.
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:43.520]  Well, radiating it, spraying live viruses on it is, and of course, a lot of soft drinks
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:48.280]  have fire retardant in it that causes liver cancer.
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:50.440]  You can't use the word retardant.
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:51.800]  That's not politically correct.
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:53.280]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:58.140]  No, it has to be fire impaired, I think is the-
[02:26:58.140 --> 02:26:59.200]  Or fire resistant.
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:00.200]  Fire resistant.
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:01.200]  There we go.
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.280]  We've got to watch our language here on your show.
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:05.760]  I'm sorry, I didn't know I was a racist.
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:07.840]  See I just showed that it's there.
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:11.980]  Well apparently, you are lacking hypnolium, which is in this formula.
[02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:13.320]  You need more hypnolium.
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:15.560]  That helps you watch CNN and believe it.
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:18.800]  Instead of it being a really scary comedy.
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:19.800]  A green screen.
[02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:20.800]  Horror comedy.
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:23.320]  CNN actually is like horror comedy.
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:26.080]  Oh, Zero Dark Thirty didn't win an Academy Award.
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:28.200]  It should have for best fiction.
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  Best fiction screenplay.
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:30.200]  Of course.
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:35.680]  But anyway, speaking of fiction, we have the actual real news that I came here to break
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:36.680]  with you today.
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:38.160]  Yeah, we're going to break in three minutes.
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:40.000]  So give us a preview of what's coming up.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.880]  Well, so we've uncovered a couple of big things happening.
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:46.080]  Number one, there's two stories I'm bringing here today.
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:50.760]  Number one is the FDA is being petitioned by the dairy industry to be able to change
[02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:57.080]  the definition of milk to include aspartame that's not listed on the label.
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:05.280]  That's almost as good as turning a gargoyle into a female senator.
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:07.400]  We were talking about the break, we are starting to go crazy.
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:08.400]  Stuff's getting so weird.
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:09.400]  Well, what can you do?
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:10.400]  You got to laugh at it.
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:11.400]  You got to make fun of it.
[02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:12.400]  I'm sorry.
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:13.400]  Go ahead.
[02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:14.400]  This story was-
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:15.400]  All the dead kids isn't funny, though.
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:16.400]  I forgot.
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:17.400]  This was written up.
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:18.500]  I think activist posts first found this.
[02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:22.760]  We wrote it and just published it a couple hours ago also, giving them credit.
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:24.120]  But the petition is real.
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:30.680]  The dairy industry wants to put aspartame in eggnog, yogurt, milk, cream, half and half,
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:33.360]  all of that without listing it on the label.
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:34.360]  Hidden.
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:37.600]  It's called an additive to change the identity of milk.
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:42.120]  I think that's a great idea, because I don't want to eat it and die of brain cancer.
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:43.880]  And all these big studies are coming out.
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:48.140]  CBS News had to admit last week that it is killing people, giving them type 2 diabetes.
[02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:49.200]  That's reasonable.
[02:28:49.200 --> 02:28:52.800]  Just like California supposedly voted down not knowing if something's GMO.
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:53.800]  I think that's reasonable.
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:56.080]  Well, I don't want to know if something's unreasonable.
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:01.480]  I mean, I get a violent headache and then a migraine if I eat MSG, and they're able
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:02.680]  to hide that name.
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:03.680]  I think that's reasonable.
[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:07.840]  You know, I'm violently allergic to it, and I shouldn't be able to know.
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:09.560]  And they argue that this is for the children.
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:10.560]  Of course it is.
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.560]  It's for the children.
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:15.040]  So they want the aspect- Well, you saw Michelle Obama on the Academy
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:16.040]  Awards.
[02:29:16.040 --> 02:29:17.040]  Yeah.
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:18.040]  I mean, she cares about the kids.
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:21.000]  I didn't watch that, but I heard- It's all about the calories, not about what
[02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  you're eating.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:25.840]  So I guess if cyanide, say, it's low calorie- Well, mercury's low calorie.
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:26.840]  You never eat again.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:27.840]  You die.
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:31.640]  You have mercury in the milk, like metal milk, liquid metal.
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:33.240]  Long as it's low calorie.
[02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:35.360]  There's hardly any calories in mercury.
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:37.120]  We should add it to Obama bites, man.
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:38.120]  Well, no.
[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:41.080]  The Journal of Pediatrics actually says- Mercury's good for you.
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:44.480]  Have you heard they want to put kids on serotonin reuptake inhibitors ahead of the vaccine?
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:45.720]  They say it makes the vaccine better?
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:46.720]  It's more effective, yeah.
[02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:47.720]  Doubles the potency.
[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:48.720]  By the way, we're not joking.
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:50.360]  We've now reached total cuckoo land.
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:51.360]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:52.360]  Stay there.
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:54.080]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.080 --> 02:30:00.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:06.440]  Introducing Pro One, all of your filtration in one system, portable, on the go.
[02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:11.040]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:16.480]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosolicic
[02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:17.480]  acid.
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:22.100]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:27.040]  aqua medics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one
[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:28.080]  filter element.
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:33.080]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off
[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:34.600]  with promo code water.
[02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:42.080]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:47.740]  ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosolicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:51.960]  by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:10.880]  Ben Soap Company.
[02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:15.200]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:19.960]  These all natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils

[02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:43.680]  This is an amazing deal.
[02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:48.880]  You can save thousands of dollars and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:32:00.480]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:05.520]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:07.880]  pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:12.680]  And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:16.840]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:32:16.840 --> 02:32:22.400]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:25.600]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:31.900]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:36.240]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once
[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:39.880]  you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:46.280]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:47.720]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:48.720]  It's incredible.

[02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:08.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:17.520]  All right, I promise, I know you're holding, have your questions ready and we'll get to
[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:20.520]  you.
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:22.880]  For everybody holding, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:23.880]  Mike Adams is here.
[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:28.320]  Mike, we always have fun behind the scenes and people are seeing that here.
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:29.740]  But some of what we're saying was joking.
[02:33:29.740 --> 02:33:35.440]  We weren't joking about, last week they were saying, we want kids to take psychotropics
[02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:37.880]  because they help the vaccine work better.
[02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:38.880]  Doesn't matter.
[02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:39.880]  That doesn't make sense.
[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:42.840]  Or the Journal of Pediatrics says mercury is actually good for your child's brain.
[02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:44.680]  And I can play that news clip.
[02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:50.080]  Again, there's several psychological tactics here, but on record, they do it to just totally
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:55.160]  freak people out where the normalcy bias is so wild.
[02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:59.060]  The government could be barbecuing children in front of you and it would be normal.
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:00.640]  That's what the military drills are about.
[02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:05.840]  They admit is to acclimate us because this system is run by scientific psychiatrists.
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:09.280]  And the truth is, though, they're a bunch of crazy people.
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:12.620]  And they came from domesticated megacities, most of them.
[02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:17.600]  That's their blind spot is that most of these technocrats themselves are completely insane
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:20.760]  and can hardly wipe their own noses.
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:21.760]  They are insane.
[02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:27.200]  If you took a classically trained doctor from just one generation ago, let's say somebody
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:31.560]  who went through med school in the 1970s or even the 1960s.
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:37.240]  And they could fast forward to today and look at this, they would think society is insane.
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:40.080]  They know you don't give vaccines to pregnant women.
[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:44.160]  They know you don't dose up infants on psychiatric drugs.
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:49.400]  They know that infants shouldn't drink fluoroelastic acid, fluoride.
[02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:58.080]  So even the medical truth, the conventional scientific truth of medicine has been so contorted
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:00.640]  into an agenda of mass poisoning.
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:02.920]  The insane now call us insane.
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:04.400]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:08.720]  And the thing is, insane people always eventually self-destruct.
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:13.720]  So this insane system of medicine, the insane system of politics, the insane system of tyranny,
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:16.800]  of malnutrition, all of these things are going to implode.
[02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:18.880]  We've just got to survive it.
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:19.880]  That's exactly it.
[02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:23.440]  And economics and finance, of course, another insane system, derivatives.
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:29.840]  So the name of the game here for us and all of our listeners out there is to survive it
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:32.000]  to simply, survival is victory.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.640]  For the next 50 years, survival is victory.
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:38.480]  If you live through it, then you're- That's what I've always said.
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:43.240]  People think if your kids grow up and have kids, you had victory.
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:44.240]  Survival is victory.
[02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:45.240]  That's exactly it.
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:46.240]  Resistance is victory.
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:47.240]  Yeah, right.
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:48.240]  Resistance is victory.
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:50.120]  Simply just being there.
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:54.880]  And this is why it's so crucial for people to get out of the cities but then to get into
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:59.800]  nutrition and grow as much of their own food as they can, supplement what they can't grow.
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:03.880]  Because nutrition for patriots is a very powerful and very important concept.
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:08.080]  It is patriots who need to survive, who need to have the physical stamina, who need to
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:10.840]  have the sensitivity of vision at night.
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:13.160]  We will inherit the earth.
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:16.900]  Because we're the ones who are healthy and sane.
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:17.900]  That's it.
[02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:23.480]  The insane people in Washington, who by the way, have never plowed a field, never milked
[02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:25.160]  a cow, nothing.
[02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:29.780]  They think they know what the real world is when they live in their palaces that are completely
[02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:30.780]  artificial.
[02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:33.880]  And by the way, you're running news companies, health companies, all of this while milking
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:40.000]  goats and cows and chickens and getting to be an expert shot at 1,000 yards with a barret.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:44.360]  Well, the milking season for my goats is over right now, so I'm not milking the goats anymore.
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:45.360]  But I did.
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:48.680]  I did milk the goats for many, many months and drank raw goats milk.
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:51.080]  And for some reason, the government didn't come raid me at that point.
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:52.080]  That is so extreme.
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:53.080]  Whoa.
[02:36:53.080 --> 02:36:54.080]  Yeah.
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:56.840]  Guys, did you hit the delay just now, the profanity?
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:59.280]  Okay, you got it, okay.
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:04.560]  But yeah, my most expensive vehicle is a John Deere tractor, for real.
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:05.680]  It really is.
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:07.160]  You've got a tractor?
[02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:08.840]  That's a terrorist right there.
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:12.960]  Yeah, when you hook up a big 15 foot shredder to the back of it, it is kind of a terror
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:13.960]  weapon.
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:16.400]  It can really knock some things around.
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:20.960]  But yeah, when I'm not working, when I'm not writing content, I'm on my farm.
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:21.960]  That's what I do.
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:23.380]  That's what I would rather do, frankly.
[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:24.380]  That's another point.
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:26.480]  We can make our own armored vehicles pretty quick.
[02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:27.720]  Actually we could.
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:33.720]  What I like to do is I like to go buy the 1970 models, the 70 through 79 John Deere
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:34.860]  tractors.
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:40.540]  Many of them were actually made just solid iron, well, not solid, but a lot of steel
[02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:43.860]  and iron in them, very little plastic and no circuits.
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:47.400]  So when you have an EMP attack from, let's say, North Korea, that's in the news right
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:50.680]  now, when all the electronics are flying- It'll be the globalists that do it, yeah,
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:51.680]  and blame them.
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:53.160]  Still use your tractor.
[02:37:53.160 --> 02:37:58.580]  And if you store some fuel and you have a 1975 John Deere, you can still farm.
[02:37:58.580 --> 02:38:01.920]  And then if things get bad, you just weld a steel cage around it and you're ready for
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:02.920]  road war.
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:03.920]  You are, yeah.
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:11.440]  Or you just park that sucker out your driveway as a barrier, or weld apparatus onto it, put
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:15.000]  yourself a gun port on that sucker, you have a John Deere 50 cal vehicle.
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.120]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:17.980]  The globalists are arming against us.
[02:38:17.980 --> 02:38:20.480]  They're acting like we don't know.
[02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:23.480]  And the public's just running around grabbing weapons saying we know they're evil.
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:26.520]  I mean, do they have any idea what they've done, these dumb little commies?
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:31.880]  No, no, and also, I think liberals and gun grabbers, they think that someone can just
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:34.560]  pick up a firearm and immediately know how to use it.
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:35.560]  They think they'll be able to do it.
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:39.120]  I've seen them on the White House petition dreaming about their new federal militia and
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:40.120]  how they're gonna hunt us down.
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:41.520]  Right, so funny, really funny.
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:45.680]  The first time they get a jam, the war's over, because the veterans and the patriots know
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:50.840]  how to tap and rack, reload, clear a jam, do all this kind of stuff, and they also know
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:52.440]  how to shoot at long range.
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:57.200]  I mean, a typical 50 cal Barrett- Well, no, they plan to sit in command centers
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:01.520]  and have drones go out and get us, but sorry, they don't have their robot army ready yet.
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:05.260]  No, so they're not gonna be nearly as effective as they think they are.
[02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:09.400]  They also think that a nine millimeter handgun will blow you physically across the room and
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:11.320]  out the window, cuz that's what they see in their movies.
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:13.040]  They don't realize that's a very weak round.
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:15.440]  Well, they do that to scare people from getting into guns.
[02:39:15.440 --> 02:39:17.000]  Well, exactly, exactly.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.600]  So veterans and patriots with rifles, they are the backbone of America.
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:25.920]  And I know maybe didn't mean for us to slip back into this topic, but that is the backbone
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:29.200]  of America, and that's what's gonna restore- Absolutely, hit the health news, hit the health
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:30.200]  news.
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:33.360]  All right, all right, so here we go.
[02:39:33.360 --> 02:39:36.520]  Some big breaking news on organics out of China.
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:38.680]  Now organic is still the best thing going.
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:43.920]  You want organic over conventional food for sure, but here's a big aha that most people
[02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:44.920]  don't realize.
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:52.380]  USDA organic standards do not limit the amount of contamination of organic foods.
[02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:56.360]  Organic can have, depending on where it's grown, it can have high levels of mercury,
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:40:01.000]  cadmium, arsenic, lead, even aluminum, pesticides, and so on.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.880]  Organic does not test for contamination levels.
[02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:08.840]  Organic is a certification of how something is grown, not the result that comes out of
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:09.840]  the farm.
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:15.680]  If you have China growing foods now being certified organic and imported into the US
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:20.640]  and sold in the USA, you gotta start thinking about how clean is that food really, even
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:21.640]  though it's organic.
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:25.840]  China, 90% of the water supply serving the cities is severely contaminated.
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:28.720]  I have an article now about cancer villages.
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:33.160]  Cancer villages, now admitted by the Chinese government because it's so toxic to live there.
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:34.160]  That sounds liberal.
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:37.900]  40% of the rivers are severely contaminated.
[02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:40.940]  Some of the rivers you can light on fire, and you've got so much petrol.
[02:40:40.940 --> 02:40:46.040]  And the river flows by the Al Gore controlled factories with the suicide nets.
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:47.040]  Probably.
[02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:48.040]  But that's liberal.
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:49.040]  Well, of course.
[02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:52.560]  I'm sure those factories discharge toxic waste directly into the river.
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:53.560]  But that's liberal.
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:54.560]  Well, right.
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:56.500]  I mean, Obama's got a peace price.
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:01.480]  But what's happening, Alex, is that organic farmers in the US are being put out of business.
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:06.560]  Jobs, agricultural jobs are shifting to China because China does not enforce any environmental
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:07.560]  regulations.
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:08.840]  No, that's the plan.
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:12.880]  You put rules here where we can't operate, then shift there, and then label toxic waste
[02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:13.880]  organic.
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:14.880]  Yes.
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:15.880]  Yes.
[02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:17.240]  And then if you don't like toxic waste, you're racist.
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:20.720]  So the key to people is check the country of origin.
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:23.300]  Organic grown in the USA is clean.
[02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:24.720]  Organic grown in Canada is clean.
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:25.720]  That's racist.
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:26.720]  I'm serious.
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:27.720]  Go ahead.
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:31.240]  Here, have some Obama bites.
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:33.720]  Organic grown in Europe is clean.
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:36.340]  Organic grown in China is questionable.
[02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:40.300]  And we did some lab tests, and we found that levels of certain metals of so-called organic
[02:41:40.300 --> 02:41:45.280]  superfoods coming out of China was 10 times higher than the levels of the same superfood
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:47.120]  grown in Taiwan.
[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:50.800]  And you don't normally think of Taiwan as a super pristine place, but compared to China,
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:52.700]  it's a lot cleaner.
[02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:57.480]  So you've got to start asking yourself, where does your organic food come from?
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:02.200]  And if you want to support America and you want to support American farmers, it's important
[02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:04.640]  to start buying organic food that's made in China.
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:06.120]  And by the way, you're just amazing, Mike.
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:07.840]  I've got to say it.
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.840]  With all the stuff you're doing, you have articles at actualnews.com.
[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:14.560]  You're not just saying this, where you have the labs and the tests and what you did.
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:16.920]  I mean, you're doing this kind of stuff every day.
[02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:20.240]  I'm just trying to keep up with info wars, frankly.
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.880]  You guys are really heading this- It makes me feel good to know there's people
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:25.880]  like you out there, buddy.
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:28.080]  I tell you, the more the merrier.
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:30.080]  It's very exciting.
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:32.600]  My thing is, I'm a whistleblower, okay?
[02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:34.400]  I'm an investigative journalist whistleblower.
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:37.140]  I like to have a little fun with Obama Bites multivitamins.
[02:42:37.140 --> 02:42:38.140]  Don't give them ideas.
[02:42:38.140 --> 02:42:42.440]  They'll put out cyanide bills and say, the children have now flown to their Lord.
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:43.560]  Obama is Christ.
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:45.920]  Take the cyanide, children.
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:49.360]  We set up our store several months ago, and we started sourcing ingredients.
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:52.280]  I was shocked to find what was in this stuff.
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:56.000]  For example, fruit powders coming from China that are conventionally grown.
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:01.160]  Did you know that nearly all of them are contaminated with genetically modified corn maltodextrin?
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:04.080]  And it's not listed on the label, and it doesn't have to be listed.
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:07.680]  So you're buying, let's say, a pomegranate powder that's imported from China, looks really
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:10.280]  cheap on Amazon.com or eBay.
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:13.720]  That might be up to 30% GMO maltodextrin that's not even-
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:16.640]  So the big news is, don't eat food from China.
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:18.280]  It's a no brainer.
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:20.200]  I think there are probably exceptions.
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:22.200]  Goji berries from China are pretty clean.
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:27.240]  There are probably other exceptions, but we need to question organics from China and regular
[02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:28.240]  food.
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.040]  Well, look, the globalists have totally destroyed the poor Chinese people.
[02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:35.920]  They have set up their global factory to leverage everybody else out while setting regulations
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:37.400]  to make everything go there.
[02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:38.600]  It's a consolidation operation.
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:39.600]  Well, yeah.
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:41.720]  I mean, and also people think about buying food from China.
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:45.600]  They don't think about, wow, that's a communist regime that militarily-
[02:43:45.600 --> 02:43:49.520]  Well, you saw the articles where they have secret greenhouses for the elite.
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:50.520]  Right.
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:55.280]  Because things are so toxic, they grow the food taxpayer paid for for themselves.
[02:43:55.280 --> 02:43:58.180]  Guys type in Chinese elite eat different food than public.
[02:43:58.180 --> 02:43:59.720]  That's the solution long term.
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:03.340]  The reason for us here in the US is to grow in greenhouses.
[02:44:03.340 --> 02:44:05.160]  You're not getting the fallout from chemtrails.
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:09.640]  You're not getting the fallout from the China pollution that is exported out of China through
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:12.600]  the trade winds and actually dumps on the Midwest.
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:18.180]  So today, if you're growing food outdoors, you are getting some level of contamination
[02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:19.180]  that you can avoid.
[02:44:19.180 --> 02:44:23.520]  But you've seen like in Oklahoma and places, they're saying, we don't want you to have
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:24.660]  a garden in your backyard.
[02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:25.660]  You might grow marijuana.
[02:44:25.660 --> 02:44:26.660]  No, no, no.
[02:44:26.660 --> 02:44:28.360]  I mean, what a free country.
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:29.360]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:30.360]  You're a prisoner.
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:32.560]  You don't grow a garden scum.
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:34.560]  So I think it's bad to have it in the greenhouse.
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:35.560]  It could be illegal.
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:37.720]  Well, and especially- Thank God the drones don't have-
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:41.080]  Or grow lights or grow pumps, circulating water.
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:43.600]  That's going to show up on your smart meter electric bill.
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:47.240]  The smart meter knows you're using grow lights and they're going to say that might be marijuana.
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:48.240]  Well, they admit that.
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:49.240]  Yeah.
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:50.240]  No, that's admitted.
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:55.760]  No, I know people in Austin, in fact, one group was going to, this is a long time ago,
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:59.600]  going to UT to get her botany degree, as much as my buddy's girlfriend.
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:03.200]  They didn't even smoke pot, like sports addict folks.
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.400]  And they SWAT teamed them and broke all their stuff and got in their face and handcuffed
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:07.400]  them on the ground.
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:08.400]  Wow.
[02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.720]  Because they had a, I can't remember, it was like a plumber or something.
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:18.320]  And they saw grow lights back there and orchids, like, oh my gosh, that plant looks like marijuana.
[02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:22.480]  So you get a SWAT team and all she's trying to do is grow the orchid.
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:27.520]  Well, I mean, no, because if you don't get plants growing at your house in America, apparently,
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.080]  apparently it's, I mean, now even a Buckeye sticker, you're going to get pulled over.
[02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:33.760]  But growing your own food is an act of resistance.
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:38.140]  You know, organic farming, local farming is an act of resistance against the system.
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:42.480]  And Alex, an exciting technology to check out, and we're going to be researching this.
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:43.840]  We're actually going to set this up.
[02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:45.360]  It's called aquaculture.
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:50.400]  You produce vegetables and fish at the same time and they share the same water.
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:51.400]  Self-contained.
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:56.600]  The emulsion grows the plants, the plant byproducts feed the fish and it's all done indoors.
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:46:00.120]  You get high quality, super clean protein and vegetables.
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:01.120]  Sounds terrorist.
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:02.120]  Sounds terrorist.
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:10.080]  Well, but that I think growth, greenhouses that grow this could be key to resisting the
[02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:12.600]  death agenda that's out there right now.
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:15.800]  And what they want to secretly put in the milk and secretly put into the cows and the
[02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:16.800]  cow feed.
[02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:17.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:18.800]  Because you covered that earlier.
[02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:19.800]  I saw that in the news.
[02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:24.120]  They want you now to put aspartame in the milk and not tell you.
[02:46:24.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  Right, right.
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:26.120]  They want you to drink.
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:28.320]  They want to change the definition of milk.
[02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:31.320]  To say milk can now include- Well, they're putting aspartame in everything and they know
[02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:36.560]  it kills the pancreas, cancer, and it's now admitted and they're killing us, but they're
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:37.560]  good people.
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:41.600]  Well, it's like Melissa Melton did a piece on aspartame in chewing gum.
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:44.220]  But at least in chewing gum, it's listed on the label.
[02:46:44.220 --> 02:46:49.180]  But this petition, if the FDA approves this, aspartame would be in milk that you don't
[02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:50.340]  even know is in there.
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:56.280]  Your only choice to avoid aspartame would be to stop buying all milk and yogurt and
[02:46:56.280 --> 02:46:57.640]  cream products.
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:46:58.640]  That's your only option.
[02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:01.340]  And see, the reason they want it is it's addicting.
[02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:02.800]  It's an excitotoxin.
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:03.800]  It's a neurotoxin.
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:04.800]  Exactly.
[02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:07.480]  It's an excitoneurotoxin, and we have Dr. Blalock on, that's poisonous.
[02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:08.480]  That's in the medical literature.
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:09.480]  Yeah.
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:13.380]  So it's an addictive speed and they're killing us.
[02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:17.380]  And then everyone's going to go, well, we got diabetes, well, we got breast cancer,
[02:47:17.380 --> 02:47:19.680]  and then go to the very medical system that's killing you.
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:23.680]  But it also potentiates the toxicity of vaccines.
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:28.080]  So if you look at the mercury, the aluminum, the MSG, and the formaldehyde that is admittedly
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:31.900]  in vaccines, CDC admits that, we documented it at National News.
[02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:36.860]  If you combine that then with aspartame and excitotoxins that are secretly put into milk,
[02:47:36.860 --> 02:47:42.480]  you have a multiplication effect of basically lobotomy, which is what the system wants.
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:45.760]  They want you to be so lobotomized- No, no, that's why a lot of the public can't
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:46.760]  talk hardly.
[02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:47.760]  No.
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:48.760]  They can just go, cowboys.
[02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:49.760]  And they can't think.
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:50.760]  They can't- 49ers.
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:51.760]  They can't watch.
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:52.760]  Obama cutting our taxes.
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:53.760]  Obama give me phone.
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:54.760]  What?
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:55.760]  Government good.
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:56.760]  Government, love government.
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:09.040]  Oh, that was a good zombie piece.
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:12.480]  I think John Baum gets the Oscar award for the best-
[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:13.480]  Maybe Dan Badande.
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:14.480]  Yeah.
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:15.480]  On that piece.
[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:19.400]  But yeah, they want people to be able to look at their paycheck and have the deduction for
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:24.300]  Obamacare and think, oh, that's not a deduction, that's a bonus.
[02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:26.180]  That's the way they want people so twisted.
[02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:27.180]  That's a bonus.
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:30.600]  And then they take money, though, out of your check on top of it.
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:31.600]  Well, yeah.
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:35.560]  Yeah, but you're not supposed to be able to do math.
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:37.000]  This is a thing.
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:42.360]  Getting back to sniper rifles, being a good sniper requires you to do a lot of math.
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:43.920]  You got to calculate a lot of things.
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:45.720]  The wind, the Coriolis.
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:51.400]  And drift, the ballistics, the dope chart of that specific cartridge, everything.
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:54.800]  If you can't do math, you can't be a good sniper, period.
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:58.060]  It won't matter soon, it's all going to be robots.
[02:48:58.060 --> 02:48:59.520]  But my point is, this is why-
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:03.300]  And by the way, a robot doesn't look like what you think it is.
[02:49:03.300 --> 02:49:08.800]  It's a Humvee that drives up with a 50 mounted where the robot is just a computer in there
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:09.800]  running the whole thing.
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:10.800]  Yeah.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:11.800]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:12.800]  Right.
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:13.800]  No, it can have any physical appearance whatsoever.
[02:49:13.800 --> 02:49:19.720]  Well, my point is that if we, the people who believe in the Constitution and the Bill of
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:24.800]  Rights, if we take care of our health, and Ben Fuchs is a great guest that you have on
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:26.360]  who agrees with all this.
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:30.560]  If we take care of our health, we're going to have the clarity of mind to achieve victory
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:32.040]  no matter what comes our way.
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:34.720]  So that's the optimistic look at all this.
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:36.720]  Well, victory is what you said.
[02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:39.680]  And the journey of 1,000 miles starts with a single step.
[02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:43.920]  It starts with really realizing this is a scientific takeover using our energy to build
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:49.840]  a self-replicating robotic technocracy to make humans obsolete.
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:53.160]  And they're selling us on us being obsolete and that we're scum right now and a self-fulfilling
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:54.160]  prophecy.
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:50:00.940]  So we stand down and invert our life force system, invert our survival instinct into
[02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:02.520]  a destructive instinct.
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:05.400]  We have to just simply flip it back the direction it's supposed to go.
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:10.180]  We're designed to do that and pull out at every level with hatred.
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:15.200]  And I say that with love for our families, it's more than hatred, directed total commitment
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:16.540]  against the enemy.
[02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:18.680]  And folks are saying, well, how do I do that?
[02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:20.440]  Realize they're attacking you.
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:24.040]  I mean, this is serious business, folks, they're killing kids everywhere.
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:28.200]  I mean, you go to the cemetery now every weekend, they're burying little kids down the street
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:29.200]  from here.
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:32.080]  I mean, they're murdering little children begging for mommy at age three as they die
[02:50:32.080 --> 02:50:33.080]  of cancer.
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:35.600]  They're murdering us, murdering filth.
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:38.960]  The cancer industry gives you poison and calls it a treatment for cancer.
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:41.760]  And the number one side effect of chemotherapy is cancer.
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:44.620]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:47.880]  It's as insane as treating sickness with mercury that they did 100 years ago.
[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:52.120]  Well, the point is, in the average doctor's compartmentalized, they are attacking us on
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:53.840]  every level.
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:54.840]  Every level.
[02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:55.840]  Biochemical.
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:50:59.120]  Well, humans have always been predators, so we've set up a system where it's a predatory
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:01.840]  system on humans.
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:03.320]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:05.160]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:07.540]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:09.240]  What can you not live without?
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:10.880]  What is your greatest dependency?
[02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:11.880]  Is it your guns?
[02:51:11.880 --> 02:51:12.880]  Is it your home?
[02:51:12.880 --> 02:51:13.880]  No.
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:14.880]  It's food.
[02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:16.320]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:20.080]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[02:51:20.080 --> 02:51:21.080]  Don't be dependent.
[02:51:21.080 --> 02:51:22.360]  Be self-sufficient.
[02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:23.960]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[02:51:23.960 --> 02:51:24.960]  Feed yourself.
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:27.200]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:02.640]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:07.200]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,
[02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:08.760]  and more into the Bokashi.
[02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:12.340]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or
[02:52:12.340 --> 02:52:17.040]  the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Taraganics.
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:21.260]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop
[02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:22.620]  using fertilizers.
[02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:25.040]  The EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.
[02:52:25.040 --> 02:52:29.360]  Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste so it
[02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:33.840]  takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:35.180]  obnoxious odors.

[02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:52.680]  That's 866-369-3678.

[02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:00.480]  Life's getting better.
[02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:06.000]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, well, it gives added peace of mind.
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:11.880]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even professional
[02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:15.500]  burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.
[02:53:15.500 --> 02:53:20.540]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near
[02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:25.040]  a window and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching
[02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:28.040]  TV when I'm actually away from home.
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:32.680]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet, just like a light on a timer.
[02:53:32.680 --> 02:53:36.560]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go.
[02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:40.600]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.
[02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:43.680]  Fake TV is only $34.95.
[02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:50.440]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to FAKETV.com.
[02:53:50.440 --> 02:53:56.840]  That's 877-532-5388 or FAKETV.com.
[02:53:56.840 --> 02:53:59.720]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:53:59.720 --> 02:54:09.320]  By the way, Mike Adams was late getting here today because they shut down some of the highways.
[02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:10.920]  The wind was so high.
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:14.680]  And I noticed that driving into work this morning, my truck was blowing all over the
[02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:17.400]  highway and I guess it got a lot faster.
[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:21.640]  Yeah, the wind gusts were quite severe and the cops are real busy right now all around
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:22.640]  Austin.
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:24.360]  There's a lot going on out there.
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:26.280]  I guess the highways got shut down from wrecks.
[02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:27.600]  Oh yeah, right, right.
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:30.800]  Or signs or power lines getting blown onto the highway or something.
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:32.040]  I don't know what it was.
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:36.920]  But yeah, I barely made it here today, which I'm usually 30 minutes early.
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:38.880]  Oh, we're not bringing up the fact that you're late, brother.
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:39.880]  It's nothing.
[02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:40.880]  We're jamming a few calls.
[02:54:40.880 --> 02:54:41.880]  You got the most of it.
[02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:44.000]  You're going to be in here Friday on the broadcast.
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.840]  I'll be working as well, but not on air.
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:48.120]  Probably be jumping in here interrupting.
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:49.840]  Probably just jump on in, man.
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:51.480]  Only show that can interrupt myself now.
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:53.560]  It's fun to have a dialogue with you, actually.
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:54.560]  Let's talk to, yeah.
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:56.200]  That's what happens when we hang out.
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:58.120]  Let's talk to Tim in Arizona.
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:59.520]  Let's talk about the Fed.
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:00.520]  Go ahead, extremist.
[02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:01.520]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:02.520]  Hi, Mike.
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:03.520]  Hey.
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:04.520]  It's an honor talking with both of you guys.
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:09.280]  I'm a little bit nervous, first time caller and also first time evil gun owner.
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:11.480]  Well, you need Obama bites.
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:16.400]  Feinsteinium would help you be able to lie to people better and, and, and, and be cold
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:17.400]  blooded reptile.
[02:55:17.400 --> 02:55:18.400]  Sorry.
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:23.040]  I'm also a prison plan member, and I've been taking the beyond tangy tangerine and actually
[02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:28.800]  used it for my first full Ironman triathlon member, did the full thing without having
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:29.800]  to walk.
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:32.880]  And I think that that those vitamins are just great.
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:38.120]  And also last month I had to interact with a guy who had the flu and I knew that if I
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:42.320]  took enough of those vitamins, I would be okay and actually health.com and buying them
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:43.440]  there also supports us.
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:44.440]  So thank you, brother.
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:45.720]  What's your point on the Fed?
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:46.720]  Okay.
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:51.960]  I had to take a, I took a class when I was in college on the federal reserve and I was
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:56.240]  one of three people in the class who was not on this federal reserve challenge team, but
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:56:02.720]  we ended up winning the national competition against all the Harvard, Yale, MITs, et cetera.
[02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:09.240]  And the motto of our class actually was in Fed we trust as disgusting as that sounds,
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:14.680]  but never once in that class that they mentioned that the federal reserve gets a 6% dividend.
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:18.720]  And this, and so I'm thinking, you know, if I took an entire class on the federal reserve
[02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:23.920]  in college, you know, with a finance major, have all my stockbrokers licenses, you know,
[02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:25.440]  how did I not even know that?
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:29.400]  And because I had a guy tell me it was private, I thought he was full of crap.
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  I set out to prove him wrong.
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:35.760]  Well, I mean, technically it's a quasi governmental power cause it has government power, but it's
[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:40.440]  private shareholders of private banks that form a holding company.
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:43.960]  So behind it is private groups and it is technically private.
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:44.960]  Yes.
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:45.960]  Yeah.
[02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:53.000]  And my question is I know that you had a long time ago, you had Walter Burian on to talk
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.880]  about the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[02:56:55.880 --> 02:57:00.800]  And I was wondering just how, what that would look like if you were ever to have him on
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:01.800]  again.
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:02.800]  I need to do that.
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:07.760]  About 80%, they've been doing this since the fifties, about 80% of government taxes, county,
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:10.200]  city, doesn't matter, are put in offshore slush funds.
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:14.160]  So when you hear about budgets, it's around 20% now, all the money they're spending, oh,
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:17.520]  we're over budgeting to raise taxes again, it's all a total scam.
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:21.400]  And the gas taxes that goes offshore, most of it.
[02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:24.440]  They're talking about shutting all the parks down in Texas, the state parks, and it turns
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:30.960]  out the entire 150 plus million dollars, takes about 45 million to run it, the $150 million
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:34.840]  that they get from sporting goods sales, it's all just taken and given away to offshore
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:35.840]  banks.
[02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:36.840]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:37.840]  California is probably the worst example of this.
[02:57:37.840 --> 02:57:39.640]  There's so many slush funds there.
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:42.300]  We investigated it and did a story on that as well.
[02:57:42.300 --> 02:57:46.680]  But it's true that people in positions of government, whether it's state or federal,
[02:57:46.680 --> 02:57:49.800]  they see that their hand is in the cookie jar.
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:53.520]  They have an opportunity- No, they invest the government money in companies
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:54.520]  their wife works at.
[02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:55.520]  There we go.
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:56.520]  And you never see.
[02:57:56.520 --> 02:57:57.520]  Feinsteinium.
[02:57:57.520 --> 02:57:58.520]  Feinsteinium.
[02:57:58.520 --> 02:57:59.520]  Good example.
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:01.800]  Right there, insider trading is routine.
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:02.800]  Everywhere.
[02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:07.360]  And they know we're waking up, so they're creating huge brigades of police with automatic
[02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:10.440]  weapons and drones, training with targets of our families to kill us.
[02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:14.800]  7,000 rifles, DHS just bought them, assault rifles, full auto, and they call them personal
[02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:15.800]  defense weapons.
[02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:21.760]  Criminal government, mafia government that has stolen everything, and now wants you dead.
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:23.480]  They've stolen the whole planet.
[02:58:23.480 --> 02:58:24.480]  Now they say it's their planet.
[02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:25.480]  They're going to kill us.
[02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:26.480]  Here comes the drones.
[02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:29.920]  Have some aspartame milk for breakfast, and some aspartame yogurt.
[02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:30.920]  You won't even know what's in there.
[02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:31.920]  How could it hurt you?
[02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:34.520]  You don't even know who you are by the time they're done with it.
[02:58:34.520 --> 02:58:37.160]  You won't worry about aspartame anymore when you're six feet under.
[02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:38.480]  More calls coming up.
[02:58:38.480 --> 02:58:39.480]  Eat your aspartame.

[02:59:55.720 --> 03:00:10.520]  You know, I like to read the comments at Infowars.com.
[03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:17.360]  He was saying, Alex, why aren't you covering the fact that a federal court says concealed
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:19.600]  gun permits not protected by the Second Amendment?
[03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:21.520]  You guys punched this up for me.
[03:00:21.520 --> 03:00:22.520]  Thanks.
[03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:24.680]  Al Weldon, go ahead and bring that on in here real quick.
[03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:25.680]  We're going to do a little bit more overdrive.
[03:00:25.680 --> 03:00:26.680]  Can you go to 20 after an overdrive?
[03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:27.680]  Yeah, you bet.
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:29.080]  Because I want to be able to take these calls.
[03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:31.640]  Come on in here, Weldon.
[03:00:31.640 --> 03:00:32.640]  Thank you, brother.
[03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:33.640]  Oh, look.
[03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:34.640]  Yeah.
[03:00:34.640 --> 03:00:35.640]  Yeah.
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:36.640]  Look, your gun happened to be here.
[03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:37.640]  Bring it on in here.
[03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:38.640]  Here it is.
[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:39.640]  Mike, thanks for bringing it by.
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:40.640]  Here we go.
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:42.640]  Here, go ahead and pull that down for me, Weldon.
[03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:43.640]  Thanks.
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:44.640]  It's like having babies.
[03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:46.040]  There was a black one in here now.
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:47.520]  Now there's a tan one.
[03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:49.080]  Put it on up here.
[03:00:49.080 --> 03:00:50.080]  Yeah.
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:51.080]  All right.
[03:00:51.080 --> 03:00:52.080]  What on earth is going on here?
[03:00:52.080 --> 03:00:53.080]  Whose is this, by the way?
[03:00:53.080 --> 03:00:54.080]  I don't know.
[03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:55.080]  It's funny.
[03:00:55.080 --> 03:00:56.080]  Must have dropped it out of the sky, huh?
[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:57.080]  And look, it's a perfect fit.
[03:00:57.080 --> 03:00:58.080]  Look at this.
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:00:59.080]  What's going on here?
[03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:00.080]  I don't know.
[03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:01.080]  Diane Feinstein actually likes this.
[03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:02.080]  She just doesn't want you to have one.
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:03.080]  Hey, don't forget to put that pin right here.
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:04.080]  Right there.
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:05.080]  Oh, yeah.
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:06.080]  We got it back there.
[03:01:06.080 --> 03:01:07.080]  Okay.
[03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:08.080]  You don't want to fire without that pin.
[03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:09.080]  No, don't worry.
[03:01:09.080 --> 03:01:10.080]  We're not firing it in the office.
[03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:11.080]  No, I hear you.
[03:01:11.080 --> 03:01:12.080]  Halfway across Austin.
[03:01:12.080 --> 03:01:13.080]  Absolutely.
[03:01:13.080 --> 03:01:14.080]  Raw.
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:15.080]  Look at that sight.
[03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:16.080]  Oh, yeah.
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:17.080]  That's a heavy beast.
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:18.080]  That's a heavy beast.
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:19.080]  That's a heavy beast.
[03:01:19.080 --> 03:01:20.080]  That's a heavy beast.
[03:01:20.080 --> 03:01:21.080]  That's a heavy beast.
[03:01:21.080 --> 03:01:22.080]  That's a heavy beast.
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:24.080]  Look at that sight.
[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:25.080]  Oh, yeah.
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:26.080]  That's a heavy beast right there.
[03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:27.080]  It's hitting the lights back there.
[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:28.080]  Sorry.
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:29.080]  It barely fits in the studio, man.
[03:01:29.080 --> 03:01:30.080]  Yeah.
[03:01:30.080 --> 03:01:31.080]  You need a tripod for that.
[03:01:31.080 --> 03:01:32.440]  You got to love the Second Amendment, huh?
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:34.880]  Tripod with wheels so you can wheel that sucker around the office.
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:37.320]  What do you think the Obama bites thinks?
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:39.080]  Obama bites is going to fire the gun.
[03:01:39.080 --> 03:01:41.120]  Here, back it up.
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:42.800]  Obama bite.
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:46.760]  Looks like you put some rounds through that one, or somebody has.
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:47.760]  It's got a little...
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:49.320]  It's still got cosmoline on it.
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:50.320]  Oh.
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:51.320]  All right.
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:52.320]  That's a heavy beast right there.
[03:01:52.320 --> 03:01:53.320]  It's right out of the box, man.
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:54.720]  First time it's ever been put together.
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:55.720]  Very nice.
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:01:56.720]  Very nice.
[03:01:56.720 --> 03:01:57.720]  Listen to that.
[03:01:57.720 --> 03:01:58.720]  The sound of freedom.
[03:01:58.720 --> 03:01:59.720]  Absolutely.
[03:01:59.720 --> 03:02:00.720]  All right.
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:03.640]  We have our special guest in the studio, the Barrett 50 cal.
[03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:05.280]  Mike, this is your Barrett.
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:06.280]  Don't lie about it.
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:07.280]  Oh, yeah.
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:08.280]  You think I would bring my Barrett?
[03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:09.280]  Wait.
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:10.280]  I don't even have a Barrett.
[03:02:10.280 --> 03:02:11.280]  What are you talking about?
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:14.000]  Literally, it's like baby Barretts are popping up everywhere.
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:18.080]  Well, Barrett's cranking them out, and I saw a news report that they're going to move out
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:20.400]  of Maryland if Maryland continues to...
[03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:21.400]  No, no, no.
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:22.400]  That's good.
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:23.400]  The gun manufacturers are saying, we're calling your bluff.
[03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:25.720]  We're not going to sell to government anymore if you pass laws.
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:26.840]  I think that's great.
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:30.640]  And I saw Midway USA, which is a great online retailer.
[03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:34.760]  They have pledged not to sell to government entities that are trying to take away our
[03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:36.280]  Second Amendment rights.
[03:02:36.280 --> 03:02:38.840]  A bunch of others, Cheaper Than Dirt, a bunch of companies.
[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:42.640]  Bravo Company USA has said they won't sell.
[03:02:42.640 --> 03:02:44.120]  Good rifles there from Bravo Company.
[03:02:44.120 --> 03:02:47.180]  So there's a lot of great examples of that.
[03:02:47.180 --> 03:02:48.560]  That's a reverse gun ban.
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:52.600]  It's the people banning guns in the hands of...
[03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:54.440]  But that's how gun owners have got to act.
[03:02:54.440 --> 03:02:57.080]  We use our clout and defeat the enemy.
[03:02:57.080 --> 03:02:58.560]  It's not enough to win a battle now.
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:04.280]  We have to win the war, hunt down the globalists politically, and remove them from the system.
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:06.920]  Well, I think that's going to happen.
[03:03:06.920 --> 03:03:09.520]  I mean, I know short term, dark times ahead.
[03:03:09.520 --> 03:03:11.640]  But long term, I'm a huge...
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:12.640]  Oh, no.
[03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:14.200]  See, they've got everybody with self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:15.200]  It's the end of the world.
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:18.080]  And they say, you're not a Christian if you don't cop out and say it's the end of the
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:19.080]  world.
[03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:20.080]  They said Hitler was the end of the world.
[03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:23.320]  Africans, the Christians being killed in Rwanda thought it was the end of the world and stood
[03:03:23.320 --> 03:03:26.200]  down when the Muslims were killing them and stuff.
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:28.960]  I mean, it's a total cop out.
[03:03:28.960 --> 03:03:33.880]  And folks, regardless, you've got to do the right thing or God isn't going to recognize
[03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:34.880]  you.
[03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:39.880]  And I mean, where do you stand on all of that, this cop out that it's got to be the end,
[03:03:39.880 --> 03:03:43.320]  tyranny's got to win, these men call in and go, how can we beat them?
[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:44.440]  How can we beat them?
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:46.360]  These people don't have the moral authority.
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:48.500]  Get in their face, stop being cowed.
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:54.120]  This is a spiritual war, not just an info war, not just a physical war, at its height,
[03:03:54.120 --> 03:03:55.120]  it's a spiritual war.
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:03:58.920]  And the devil goes around roaring, seeing who he can devour, who cowers.
[03:03:58.920 --> 03:03:59.920]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:04.200]  And look, I think there are individuals involved in government right now who are literally
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:07.600]  possessed, literally demonically possessed.
[03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:09.720]  Look at Diane Feinstein, she is definitely a demon.
[03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:12.080]  I'm telling you, I think this is real.
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:18.640]  And so I think this is a spiritual war and self-defense is a divine right, Alex.
[03:04:18.640 --> 03:04:21.820]  It goes along with us having consciousness, us having free will.
[03:04:21.820 --> 03:04:26.000]  The creator created this universe, which may or may not be a simulation in the eyes of
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  the creator.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.080]  You've covered that, Paul Watson's covered that.
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:36.500]  But in this existence, we must maintain the integrity of the divine, which is to help
[03:04:36.500 --> 03:04:41.440]  others have compassion, but also to defend what is right, including through the use of
[03:04:41.440 --> 03:04:43.000]  force as a last resort.
[03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  Well, exactly.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.400]  We're supposed to smash tyrants when they rise up.
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:47.400]  Absolutely.
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:48.400]  Who will protect the innocent?
[03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:49.880]  The Bible asks over and over again.
[03:04:49.880 --> 03:04:52.680]  Who will rise up and protect the widows and orphans?
[03:04:52.680 --> 03:04:53.680]  Very few.
[03:04:53.680 --> 03:04:56.840]  But more and more, it's a small number, but it's growing.
[03:04:56.840 --> 03:04:58.600]  And the enemy is totally afraid of us.
[03:04:58.600 --> 03:05:00.600]  Your call's coming up.
[03:05:00.600 --> 03:05:02.760]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.760 --> 03:05:09.100]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we
[03:05:09.100 --> 03:05:14.120]  are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:19.760]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:05:19.760 --> 03:05:20.760]  your help.
[03:05:20.760 --> 03:05:26.000]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:32.020]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.020 --> 03:05:35.480]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.480 --> 03:05:41.680]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.680 --> 03:05:49.120]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics, dehumanization
[03:05:49.120 --> 03:05:50.640]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:50.640 --> 03:05:53.040]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.040 --> 03:06:00.200]  It's an info war, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:00.200 --> 03:06:02.440]  Hey, everybody.
[03:06:02.440 --> 03:06:03.600]  Ty Bollinger here.
[03:06:03.600 --> 03:06:05.960]  Once again, real life, real stories.
[03:06:05.960 --> 03:06:07.640]  And he discovered Carnivora.
[03:06:07.640 --> 03:06:12.040]  He was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his family and his friends
[03:06:12.040 --> 03:06:13.040]  and his patients.
[03:06:13.040 --> 03:06:14.320]  My dad was a family physician.
[03:06:14.320 --> 03:06:15.800]  He was a medical doctor.
[03:06:15.800 --> 03:06:18.760]  Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone.
[03:06:18.760 --> 03:06:20.920]  Amazing product, amazing results.
[03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:26.600]  Like an amazing thing, having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing that it was
[03:06:26.600 --> 03:06:28.280]  the Carnivora that did it.
[03:06:28.280 --> 03:06:34.640]  And a lot of patients got better, ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.
[03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:39.160]  Here's the toll free telephone number to call to access the Carnivora telecast at carnivora.com
[03:06:39.160 --> 03:06:42.400]  on Tuesday, March 12th, 8 p.m. Eastern Time.
[03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:45.760]  Call 1-888-694-9666.
[03:06:45.760 --> 03:06:49.480]  That's 1-888-694-9666.
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:53.760]  Once again, 1-888-694-9666.
[03:06:53.760 --> 03:07:00.880]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com or call 1-866-VENUSFLY to order now.
[03:07:00.880 --> 03:07:02.080]  My name is Steven Huir.
[03:07:02.080 --> 03:07:06.000]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions
[03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:09.320]  have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[03:07:09.320 --> 03:07:13.180]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious
[03:07:13.180 --> 03:07:17.680]  matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting
[03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:21.360]  one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.
[03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:25.800]  One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione
[03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:26.800]  production.
[03:07:26.800 --> 03:07:30.800]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:35.280]  I got him on One World Way, and in two months his constipation is gone.
[03:07:35.280 --> 03:07:39.640]  He has become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has
[03:07:39.640 --> 03:07:40.640]  made his first friend.
[03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:44.760]  He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.
[03:07:44.760 --> 03:07:49.760]  You could offer him a present or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.
[03:07:49.760 --> 03:08:02.320]  Go to OneWorldWay.com, that's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com, or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.
[03:08:02.320 --> 03:08:07.840]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:07.840 --> 03:08:13.120]  All right, final segment here with Mike Adams in the studio.
[03:08:13.120 --> 03:08:17.280]  They're now coming out with drones to hunt down gun owners who can't make this up.
[03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:20.600]  And I saw a comment on Infowars.com, one of the stories saying, why aren't you covering
[03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:22.960]  a federal court?
[03:08:22.960 --> 03:08:27.120]  Saying that you don't have a right to concealed carry, that's not a Second Amendment.
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:33.120]  I've always said that they took something that was not in the Constitution Bill of Rights,
[03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:36.840]  cuz concealed weapons have always been seen as something a criminal does.
[03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:41.760]  You can have any weapon you want if it's being bore openly.
[03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:47.080]  They wanted to make them go into a secret spot, so that, quote, the criminals would
[03:08:47.080 --> 03:08:48.800]  be scared and not know where they are.
[03:08:48.800 --> 03:08:50.160]  That's how they sold it to gun owners.
[03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:53.680]  But the truth is, under common law, which predates even the Constitution Bill of Rights
[03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:57.800]  that it's all based on, concealed weapons generally were illegal.
[03:08:57.800 --> 03:09:03.100]  So see, because it is illegal, you can get a permit to do something that would be illegal.
[03:09:03.100 --> 03:09:08.760]  That's where they had that loophole to then authorize something to create the idea that
[03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:12.320]  government has to authorize you to have a gun.
[03:09:12.320 --> 03:09:17.200]  So people can argue both ends of it, but now the federal court, 10th Circuit, has ruled
[03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:21.280]  that they can revoke it for any time they want and refuse anyone they want, even if
[03:09:21.280 --> 03:09:22.920]  you don't have a criminal record.
[03:09:22.920 --> 03:09:28.440]  A federal judge in 2011 tossed out Peterson's lawsuit, filed against Denver, and the State's
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:29.440]  Department of Public Safety.
[03:09:29.440 --> 03:09:33.420]  Peterson claims that being denied a concealed weapons permit because he was not a Colorado
[03:09:33.420 --> 03:09:36.520]  resident violated his Second Amendment rights to bear arms.
[03:09:36.520 --> 03:09:42.040]  But now the 11th, or no, 10th Circuit Court of Appeals has issued this on Friday, I missed
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:45.000]  it, saying no, we can take it for any reason we wish.
[03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:48.040]  So it just shows how criminal the government's gotten.
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:53.760]  Well, again, what part of keeping bear arms shall not be infringed do they not understand?
[03:09:53.760 --> 03:09:55.280]  It's very clear.
[03:09:55.280 --> 03:09:59.400]  You either have the right to bear them openly or to carry them concealed.
[03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:02.040]  One or the other has gotta be protected under the Second Amendment.
[03:10:02.040 --> 03:10:03.780]  They can't- Well, technically, the Second Amendment went
[03:10:03.780 --> 03:10:06.600]  even further, so you could argue concealed or not.
[03:10:06.600 --> 03:10:09.800]  It's just in the old days, it's like, hey, wear your sword, wear your weapons.
[03:10:09.800 --> 03:10:12.240]  They're planning something sneaky if they aren't out in the open.
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:17.120]  Look, I would love to live in a community- I think everybody should be armed and wear
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:18.120]  them.
[03:10:18.120 --> 03:10:19.120]  I agree.
[03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:20.120]  The criminals will be real scared.
[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:21.120]  I completely agree.
[03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:22.120]  In fact- You're packing right now?
[03:10:22.120 --> 03:10:23.120]  I am packing right now.
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:24.200]  I'm packing right now?
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:26.480]  I always carry a Glock when I'm here.
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:27.680]  Actually, I carry it everywhere.
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:30.040]  I carry it through the Austin airport.
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:31.040]  And it's legal.
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:32.040]  It's legal.
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:33.040]  I'm licensed.
[03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:34.040]  It's legal.
[03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:35.040]  I don't break fire.
[03:10:35.040 --> 03:10:38.600]  No, no, no, they love the illusion that all the guns are illegal because they base all
[03:10:38.600 --> 03:10:43.600]  the shows in New York or LA or Chicago, again, the cleaning person coming to clean your carpets
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:46.980]  thinks your gun case is illegal and runs out freaking out.
[03:10:46.980 --> 03:10:47.980]  These are mentally ill people.
[03:10:47.980 --> 03:10:51.840]  No, and it's funny because I can be walking through the Austin airport looking at a TSA
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:52.840]  officer.
[03:10:52.840 --> 03:10:57.640]  That, officer's not even the right word, a person wearing a costume, that person's unarmed
[03:10:57.640 --> 03:11:01.280]  while I've got 30 rounds on me and a loaded gun.
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:04.520]  And I'm a citizen who's going to stop a criminal act-
[03:11:04.520 --> 03:11:06.560]  But they don't want the public knowing that.
[03:11:06.560 --> 03:11:07.560]  No, they don't.
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:10.720]  That's why I think we should all, it should be legal to wear the guns.
[03:11:10.720 --> 03:11:15.120]  Well, it is in almost every state by fraud, but they still act like it's horrible when
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:16.120]  you do it.
[03:11:16.120 --> 03:11:19.920]  And it's like, if I was a criminal about to kill everybody, it'd be hidden and you wouldn't
[03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:20.920]  know.
[03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:21.920]  Right, right.
[03:11:21.920 --> 03:11:27.800]  Well, criminals, this is why, by the way, TSA checkpoints may be targets of criminals
[03:11:27.800 --> 03:11:28.800]  or even false flag attacks.
[03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:30.080]  Because it's a victim disarmament zone.
[03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:32.600]  Because they know people aren't armed who are standing in that line.
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:34.640]  But you can be armed in the luggage area.
[03:11:34.640 --> 03:11:38.400]  You can be armed as long as you don't go through the TSA checkpoint here in Austin.
[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:43.280]  So you can carry a loaded gun with a concealed carry permit all over that airport except
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:44.280]  in the security area.
[03:11:44.280 --> 03:11:46.400]  And then you can also unload it, check it, and ship it.
[03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:47.400]  You can.
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:48.400]  Yeah.
[03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:49.400]  Let's go to calls because I promise to.
[03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:55.280]  Let's talk to Adam in Vermont, Army Katrina, illegal ops is what he wants to talk about.
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:56.280]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:11:57.280]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[03:11:57.280 --> 03:12:02.000]  Yeah, sorry, I've wanted to talk to you for a while, but I've always been hesitant to
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  do it.
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:07.920]  But yeah, I was in US Army psychological operations and one of our deployments I was involved
[03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:12.360]  in was going in in support of Katrina at New Orleans.
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:16.880]  And I, you know, in the past, I didn't think anything of it.
[03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:21.400]  But now I know, you know, you see MJ code, you cannot conduct sign up on US citizens
[03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:23.420]  at all completely illegal.
[03:12:23.420 --> 03:12:26.040]  And their way of getting around it.
[03:12:26.040 --> 03:12:30.640]  We were not called to stop you know, they called us a public information element.
[03:12:30.640 --> 03:12:35.920]  And in order to, I guess, hide the possibility of the site, they even have to take our patches
[03:12:35.920 --> 03:12:41.680]  off, which is the US Army, civil affairs and facts and patch.
[03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:42.680]  And yeah, we.
[03:12:42.680 --> 03:12:48.240]  Yeah, they had to put fake patches on, which is again, another act of espionage to go under
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:52.120]  something you're not is an international and national crime.
[03:12:52.120 --> 03:12:53.120]  Did you know that?
[03:12:53.120 --> 03:12:57.880]  But again, see, the average person who's compartmentalized doesn't know you guys are under more psyops
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:12:58.880]  than anybody else.
[03:12:58.880 --> 03:12:59.880]  No, absolutely.
[03:12:59.880 --> 03:13:04.080]  You know, that's something I've actually been been realizing myself recently, and I have
[03:13:04.080 --> 03:13:06.880]  told some friends of mine who are starting to get into this kind of thing.
[03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:11.000]  Yeah, the biggest mission I think of officers, especially in style or military intelligence
[03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:15.600]  or anything else, the biggest job of them to try to make the under personnel like myself
[03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:18.640]  at the time, not realize what the hell we're doing.
[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:19.640]  Exactly.
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:23.280]  They're practicing deception, but they're being deceived as well.
[03:13:23.280 --> 03:13:28.680]  You see, if they just gave into the truth, then they would be given real perception and
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:29.680]  discernment.
[03:13:29.680 --> 03:13:30.680]  They don't have that.
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:34.480]  They think deception is giving them power, but that's not the truth.
[03:13:34.480 --> 03:13:35.480]  Absolutely.
[03:13:35.480 --> 03:13:38.240]  So here's something else, too.
[03:13:38.240 --> 03:13:45.520]  Can you guess who our call makers were, the people who had the missions in plan for us?
[03:13:45.520 --> 03:13:46.520]  Can you guess who that was?
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:48.520]  ATF or FBI?
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:49.520]  FEMA.
[03:13:49.520 --> 03:13:55.200]  Sure, but assigned under FEMA, I mean, I knew because in the news, wasn't it FBI under FEMA
[03:13:55.200 --> 03:14:02.000]  leading the psychological testing raids where they went and got the guns?
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  I don't know.
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.040]  I wasn't involved in that part.
[03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:08.480]  All I know is that the commands that were coming down who were telling us what pamphlets
[03:14:08.480 --> 03:14:11.680]  and everything else they want to have us make was FEMA.
[03:14:11.680 --> 03:14:15.600]  At least from my position, I didn't know anything about FBI.
[03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:16.600]  Let me ask you this.
[03:14:16.600 --> 03:14:17.600]  Sure, sure.
[03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:19.920]  Let me ask you this.
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:22.960]  Dealing with all this now, talking to your buddies that might still be in or maybe you're
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:23.960]  still in.
[03:14:23.960 --> 03:14:26.680]  Are people starting to wake up in the larger psyop?
[03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:31.040]  Yeah, actually, I'm not in the army anymore.
[03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:35.040]  The people that I used to work with are not in contact too much, and I'm even hesitant
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:37.480]  to talk to them about it because they really are.
[03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:41.240]  I mean, they don't know what the hell is going on, but I do know a lot of other people who
[03:14:41.240 --> 03:14:42.760]  are waking up.
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:44.600]  I know people in National Guard.
[03:14:44.600 --> 03:14:50.560]  I know an officer actually here in Vermont who told me that they had a briefing recently
[03:14:50.560 --> 03:14:57.360]  asking the staff, how would you feel about getting a command to shoot a U.S. citizen?
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:14:58.360]  That's no joke.
[03:14:58.360 --> 03:14:59.360]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:14:59.360 --> 03:15:02.080]  Listen, that's going on everywhere.
[03:15:02.080 --> 03:15:03.080]  That's going on everywhere.
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:07.040]  Yeah, I know I've heard about the testing going on and everything else.
[03:15:07.040 --> 03:15:11.800]  What did he think of them asking them in the unit, what do you think of shooting the American
[03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:12.800]  people?
[03:15:12.800 --> 03:15:13.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:16.520]  And yeah, people are waking up, absolutely.
[03:15:16.520 --> 03:15:20.200]  I've never even come to him and said, what do you think of Alex Jones or anything else
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:21.200]  like that?
[03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:26.840]  He came to me and told me that without even knowing that I'm into all of this.
[03:15:26.840 --> 03:15:27.840]  Very interesting, sir.
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:29.360]  Thank you for holding to tell us that.
[03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:30.360]  God bless.
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:33.200]  Mike Adam, before we take a few more calls here.
[03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:36.560]  We look at this shy off and it looks like it's going to fall foul on its face, except
[03:15:36.560 --> 03:15:41.520]  for one thing, as much as we wake people up now, what's it going to matter when they detonate
[03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:43.700]  a nuke and blame it on the Patriots?
[03:15:43.700 --> 03:15:47.000]  As all the West Point documents are now saying, they're going to put the script out.
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:52.440]  Even though it doesn't make sense that the Patriots are working with Al-Qaeda.
[03:15:52.440 --> 03:15:53.960]  Now how do you head that off?
[03:15:53.960 --> 03:15:59.200]  Well, we work as hard as we can now to inoculate the public psychologically to the truth.
[03:15:59.200 --> 03:16:01.900]  We've got the trump card, the ace of spades, the truth.
[03:16:01.900 --> 03:16:02.900]  What else do we do?
[03:16:02.900 --> 03:16:06.480]  Because even though this doesn't make sense, it only makes sense with really bad false
[03:16:06.480 --> 03:16:07.480]  flags.
[03:16:07.480 --> 03:16:13.440]  No, you are on top of the best strategy right now, which is to psychologically inoculate
[03:16:13.440 --> 03:16:14.440]  the population.
[03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:19.240]  But also to encourage people to, if something big happens, immediately start filming, start
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:20.240]  recording.
[03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:24.400]  Audio, video, start documenting it right there at that spot.
[03:16:24.400 --> 03:16:28.240]  And because you know how the mainstream media will get a hold of it and change the story
[03:16:28.240 --> 03:16:29.640]  like they did with Dorner.
[03:16:29.640 --> 03:16:33.440]  This whole thing like we didn't start the fire, really?
[03:16:33.440 --> 03:16:34.440]  Do you think where that's-
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:38.880]  And for a day they wouldn't discuss it and then suddenly then they whitewashed, but people
[03:16:38.880 --> 03:16:40.840]  were taping live when it happened.
[03:16:40.840 --> 03:16:46.620]  But keep this in mind, Christopher Dorner, one man with some training in weapons.
[03:16:46.620 --> 03:16:54.240]  One man was able to occupy about 5,000 roughly, give or take, police officers and sheriff's
[03:16:54.240 --> 03:16:56.840]  deputies in California, one man.
[03:16:56.840 --> 03:17:03.840]  So think about the effectiveness of just 1,000 people who are committed to freedom.
[03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:06.840]  I'm not trying to say that Dorner was committed to freedom, but he's totally different.
[03:17:06.840 --> 03:17:09.880]  Sure, plus I looked at his strategy, I didn't think his strategy was very good.
[03:17:09.880 --> 03:17:14.400]  It wasn't very good, but imagine the effectiveness of even a small number of people who are committed
[03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:18.320]  to protecting law, which is the Constitution, which is the Bill of Rights.
[03:17:18.320 --> 03:17:21.720]  And by the way, I mean, patriots, if they ever have to defend themselves, it'll make
[03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:22.720]  Dorner look like-
[03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:23.720]  Absolutely.
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:25.280]  An absolute wimp.
[03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:29.960]  There was that the Red Dawn movie that recently came out, which is kind of ridiculous movie,
[03:17:29.960 --> 03:17:34.400]  but it showed teenagers with rocket launchers and everything.
[03:17:34.400 --> 03:17:41.480]  But the quote from one of the actors in that movie was, now we are on the side that creates
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:44.160]  chaos, that's straight out of the movie.
[03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:48.400]  We are the rebels creating chaos, and their job was to create chaos against the invading
[03:17:48.400 --> 03:17:52.520]  enemy occupying force of North Korea in the film.
[03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:56.000]  And the film depicted them as being very effective at doing that.
[03:17:56.000 --> 03:18:02.060]  I think actual farmers and ranchers here in Central Texas are even more effective.
[03:18:02.060 --> 03:18:04.280]  They know how to get things done.
[03:18:04.280 --> 03:18:06.680]  That's all I'm gonna say.
[03:18:06.680 --> 03:18:10.800]  All I know is the global is sitting there, big compact cities, looking at all the jellyfish
[03:18:10.800 --> 03:18:12.480]  and they think everybody's like that.
[03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:13.480]  They're not.
[03:18:13.480 --> 03:18:17.720]  The public now has gone from being concerned and getting ready to almost ready and wanting
[03:18:17.720 --> 03:18:18.720]  it.
[03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:21.040]  I don't think the system gets it that the people I've talked to, they're like ready.
[03:18:21.040 --> 03:18:23.480]  I mean, I'm just like, whoa, no, no.
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:25.000]  People aren't buying into it.
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:30.560]  Maybe in the cities, if you live in an artificial construct city and you watch the artificial
[03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:32.520]  news, CNN and so on.
[03:18:32.520 --> 03:18:35.880]  Yeah, the wirehead matrix heads, the matrix heads.
[03:18:35.880 --> 03:18:39.760]  Artificial medicine, which is vaccines and artificial food, which is the aspartame milk
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:40.760]  that we-
[03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:41.760]  No, the brain damaging systems, yeah.
[03:18:41.760 --> 03:18:44.000]  So if you're lobotomized, yeah, you might buy into it.
[03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:48.800]  But if you live in the real world and you have real skills like welding, or farming,
[03:18:48.800 --> 03:18:56.000]  or car repair, or taking care of cattle, if you have real skills, then you've got something.
[03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:57.000]  You know what the real world-
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:00.920]  Well, it's almost like if you have to do real work, you have to not be in the matrix to
[03:19:00.920 --> 03:19:01.920]  be able to do the work.
[03:19:01.920 --> 03:19:02.920]  That's right.
[03:19:02.920 --> 03:19:03.920]  That's right.
[03:19:03.920 --> 03:19:09.440]  Because people who want to grab the guns, I think mostly they do that because guns scare
[03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:10.440]  them.
[03:19:10.440 --> 03:19:12.060]  They're very, very afraid of the guns themselves.
[03:19:12.060 --> 03:19:15.600]  Not even so much the people, but the guns themselves scare them.
[03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:19.040]  And when you see them try to shoot a gun for the first time, they'll do this bit where
[03:19:19.040 --> 03:19:20.400]  they lean back at the range.
[03:19:20.400 --> 03:19:21.400]  You've seen this?
[03:19:21.400 --> 03:19:22.400]  Yeah.
[03:19:22.400 --> 03:19:23.400]  They're leaning way back.
[03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:24.700]  They're not leaning forward into the shot.
[03:19:24.700 --> 03:19:25.700]  They're afraid of the object.
[03:19:25.700 --> 03:19:28.680]  They're trying to create as much distance from the object that's in their own hands
[03:19:28.680 --> 03:19:29.680]  as possible.
[03:19:29.680 --> 03:19:32.240]  It's an interesting psychological observation.
[03:19:32.240 --> 03:19:37.360]  Someone who's comfortable with guns will take an AR-15, lean right into it, and put their
[03:19:37.360 --> 03:19:43.080]  cheek right on the buttstock and get right in there and fire away because they understand
[03:19:43.080 --> 03:19:44.560]  that that weapon is a tool.
[03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:45.560]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:48.800]  And these chicken neck globalists with all their black uniforms and all this stuff, they're
[03:19:48.800 --> 03:19:54.640]  leaning back in their attack on us, but trying to look like they're forward in it through
[03:19:54.640 --> 03:19:55.680]  their fear.
[03:19:55.680 --> 03:20:00.240]  And all they're doing is hitting the red alert button to get everybody ready, ready to roll.
