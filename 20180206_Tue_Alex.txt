[00:00.000 --> 00:21.760]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:21.760 --> 00:41.840]  the Info War. One thing is 100% crystal clear, ladies and gentlemen, and it's that the private
[00:41.840 --> 00:49.760]  Federal Reserve has raised interest rates more on President Trump in the last 13 months
[00:49.760 --> 00:59.120]  than it did in eight years of Barack Hussein Obama, and that raising interest rates will
[00:59.120 --> 01:06.280]  put a damper on the fast growing economy. And of course, the stock market being a major
[01:06.280 --> 01:15.400]  engine of that economy when it's coupled with a reindustrialization, retooling, and of course,
[01:15.400 --> 01:23.200]  rebuild of the infrastructure, all of which we are in a headlong assault right now against
[01:23.200 --> 01:29.320]  the globalist to try to turn the Republic back on before it's too late. And if you needed
[01:29.320 --> 01:32.920]  a cherry on top, as we've been predicting this, the clips are all coming out in the
[01:32.920 --> 01:39.560]  next segment, if you needed more added evidence, they've been bragging about it. They've been
[01:39.560 --> 01:44.600]  talking about it. They've been trying to talk down the stock market. And then ABC News yesterday
[01:44.600 --> 01:51.680]  had news alerts, when it had only dropped 400 points, saying news alerts, the stock market
[01:51.680 --> 01:59.240]  crashed. A crash is more than half of a market. They've got lots of other names like Bloody
[01:59.240 --> 02:10.000]  Friday or Dark This or Dark That. But we would have had to have lost 6,000 plus points in
[02:10.000 --> 02:21.760]  the stock market, 6,013 points on top of the 1500 plus close to 1600 points. So we're talking
[02:21.760 --> 02:31.320]  close to 8,000 points. It would have had to have fallen. The stock market's up 40% on
[02:31.320 --> 02:36.520]  the Dow Jones industrial average history in the last 13 months. Well, 15 of you count
[02:36.520 --> 02:43.840]  since he was president-elect, technically. And look, it's a big bubble. It's dangerous.
[02:43.840 --> 02:54.520]  You name it. And it's regained a few hundred points from yesterday. But it's our bubble.
[02:54.520 --> 03:01.240]  And the Communist Chinese are on record, putting many times more of their yin and yang in to
[03:01.240 --> 03:06.480]  prop up their stock market. And if you talk down their stock market, you get imprisoned
[03:06.480 --> 03:11.080]  or even executed. To all the people that are cheerleading for China and saying it's in a
[03:11.080 --> 03:19.280]  better position, it's not because of the cultural disparity of rich versus poor and the fact
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.400]  that they are totally maxed out and have low energy stores and a lot of other factors.
[03:23.400 --> 03:28.280]  I don't wish China bad. But the globalists have put their eggs in that basket. Lloyd
[03:28.280 --> 03:33.560]  Blank finds bragged about it as Twitter feed. And they're betting on an American collapse
[03:33.560 --> 03:38.440]  in a Chinese century. That's the religion of the Council on Foreign Relations and the
[03:38.440 --> 03:44.800]  globalist for 40 years. Look it up yourself. You've all heard in the Economist magazine
[03:44.800 --> 03:51.480]  everywhere, the breathless Chinese century that's coming and they've got all the technology
[03:51.480 --> 03:55.840]  and, you know, they'll kill Christians and Buddhists and sell their organs and they've
[03:55.840 --> 04:01.440]  got one child policies. Why? They're really progressive. They're totally bad in Christianity.
[04:01.440 --> 04:07.680]  The left in Hollywood likes it. Can't watch any show that's supposedly based in the future
[04:07.680 --> 04:14.960]  from Netflix or Hollywood that isn't China centric, China file. No Americanism. It's
[04:14.960 --> 04:25.540]  all global Chinism or China would. It's all built on sand. And if America gets its morals
[04:25.540 --> 04:29.720]  back and gets its optimism back, nothing can stand in our way and we will raise the
[04:29.720 --> 04:40.080]  entire planet as we did for our first 170 plus years, 180 plus years. Really the first
[04:40.080 --> 04:48.160]  200. And they know that that's why globalism is up against Americanism. That's why Trump
[04:48.160 --> 04:54.920]  is now told his greatest truth yet saying Democrats are like death on American and treasonous.
[04:54.920 --> 05:01.920]  That video is straight ahead.
[05:01.920 --> 05:28.120]  This is
[05:28.120 --> 05:32.360]  mobility, joint function, immune system and so much more.
[05:32.360 --> 05:37.320]  Now we're not even including a lot of the benefits that this product has been scientifically
[05:37.320 --> 05:40.080]  proven to have.
[05:40.080 --> 05:44.440]  So I've just got this brush today, literally the seal's not even being opened on it, it's
[05:44.440 --> 05:51.080]  just 29.95 again, big, big chunky bottle, 120 capsules in this bottle.
[05:51.080 --> 05:56.560]  It is Bodys, the ultimate turmeric and inflammatory support product on the market available right
[05:56.560 --> 06:07.280]  now at InfowarsStore.com, get it today.
[06:07.280 --> 06:11.600]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[06:11.600 --> 06:23.200]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:23.200 --> 06:39.280]  Deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its Alex Jones.
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.000]  And it's tomorrow's news today.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.280]  In fact, just yesterday in the second hour, I talked about the fact that we're on top
[06:48.280 --> 06:53.240]  of a giant bubble and that it could be imploded by the Federal Reserve raising interest rates
[06:53.240 --> 06:59.080]  at any time, but that it's all Trump could do to have a bubble for the people instead
[06:59.080 --> 07:00.800]  of the globalist.
[07:00.800 --> 07:05.400]  Just like you give a dying person an adrenaline shot, hoping it brings them back to life and
[07:05.400 --> 07:10.240]  sometimes it makes their heart explode instead of saving them.
[07:10.240 --> 07:20.320]  As we were talking, the organized plunge had begun and we 100% know that Goldman Sachs
[07:20.320 --> 07:27.800]  and JP Morgan and other big trading arms of those combines had their automatic computers
[07:27.800 --> 07:36.400]  that's being reported by CNBC said that when the market dropped just a few hundred points,
[07:36.400 --> 07:48.640]  they had been pre-programmed to a lower threshold to kick into auto selling because it had dropped
[07:48.640 --> 07:51.040]  a couple hundred points a few weeks ago, a few months ago.
[07:51.040 --> 07:57.120]  They had already decided they go, oh, it's the computers, but who programs the computers?
[07:57.120 --> 08:01.040]  It's like, oh, the computers decide who do not give healthcare under bioethics.
[08:01.040 --> 08:08.160]  By the Watson computer named after a top Nazi, Thomas Watson, the computer decides to stop
[08:08.160 --> 08:09.600]  giving you food and water and kill you.
[08:09.600 --> 08:12.920]  It's okay, but who programs it?
[08:12.920 --> 08:17.720]  So Goldman Sachs and others with their patented and Bloomberg's involved in it as well with
[08:17.720 --> 08:23.480]  his own system, super fast trading systems that can siphon billions off a day, basically
[08:23.480 --> 08:31.280]  swindling your regular traders, they had it programmed at a very low threshold, not
[08:31.280 --> 08:35.400]  where it plunged at thousand points or 2,000 points, but if it went down a couple hundred
[08:35.400 --> 08:40.320]  points, they're saying it's all proprietary, but the stock traders on Wall Street saw it
[08:40.320 --> 08:46.640]  all kick in when the market dropped 200 points and then as soon as it fell, other groups
[08:46.640 --> 08:52.040]  that had theirs set at a higher threshold where it had to be a bigger plunge than they
[08:52.040 --> 08:56.680]  all started kicking in.
[08:56.680 --> 09:00.480]  And then you saw the plunge protection team, obviously Trump calling up the Federal Reserve
[09:00.480 --> 09:04.280]  and going, I will fire you right now if you don't stop that.
[09:04.280 --> 09:07.560]  And then they play the game of, oh, yes, sir, we'll stop that right now.
[09:07.560 --> 09:15.520]  So it was artificially plunged by the public hearing, oh my gosh, uncertainty, the country's
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.720]  in a civil war, the Federal Reserve is going to raise interest rates a lot.
[09:20.720 --> 09:25.640]  They've already raised it in the last 13 months, more than eight years of Obama.
[09:25.640 --> 09:31.440]  That drove things down and we noticed some of the big top firms were selling, some of
[09:31.440 --> 09:38.040]  the top Apple guys, some of the top Amazon guys, some of the top Facebook people.
[09:38.040 --> 09:46.640]  They were all selling the hour before, just enough to start the dip and then the auto
[09:46.640 --> 09:52.080]  trading kicked in.
[09:52.080 --> 09:58.040]  So last week, what did we say about them raising interest rates yet again?
[09:58.040 --> 10:02.560]  And saying that they need to go up even more, we said that could kill the market and everybody
[10:02.560 --> 10:07.560]  else that does research said that.
[10:07.560 --> 10:13.120]  And then meanwhile, not just yesterday, but today, Robo Advisor websites have been crashing,
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.080]  locking out traders from their accounts.
[10:19.080 --> 10:23.520]  So you also have the big companies, not just because of the volume, but locking people
[10:23.520 --> 10:24.520]  out.
[10:24.520 --> 10:25.520]  It's famous.
[10:25.520 --> 10:29.000]  They're famous for doing that so that they can control the trades and so they can get
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.280]  out, but you can't get out.
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.040]  They can pre-program the computers on what they're going to allow to go down.
[10:36.040 --> 10:40.600]  They can set how much they're going to let it go down, then they can go in and start
[10:40.600 --> 10:45.920]  their sales, but knowing it's going to trigger a panic, they cannot let you sell until they
[10:45.920 --> 10:50.240]  know the plunge protection team's going to kick back in, then they go in and turn the
[10:50.240 --> 10:51.320]  control back off.
[10:51.320 --> 10:56.320]  And it's just the little guys, the middle size, the big mega ones, the big banks, foreign
[10:56.320 --> 11:03.320]  governments, they're all in our stock market just scamming away and making money off, riding
[11:03.320 --> 11:08.360]  it down and riding it up, riding it down and riding it up.
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.560]  And I know this, you know this, we all know this.
[11:12.560 --> 11:16.800]  The point is Trump engineered it so that a lot of the money would actually go to Main
[11:16.800 --> 11:22.120]  Street and go to reindustrialization and retooning and infrastructure.
[11:22.120 --> 11:26.680]  And that's why all these foreign companies go, yes, we are moving here because they're
[11:26.680 --> 11:30.040]  setting the climate up to help that.
[11:30.040 --> 11:37.640]  So I put this out yesterday saying, oh, high frequency trading preset sell points by Goldman
[11:37.640 --> 11:38.640]  Sachs.
[11:38.640 --> 11:39.640]  That's the biggest in the world.
[11:39.640 --> 11:40.640]  They run it.
[11:40.640 --> 11:41.640]  They're the top people.
[11:41.640 --> 11:42.640]  They're on record.
[11:42.640 --> 11:45.880]  It's in the news that they had pre-sale settings, though it's not their fault.
[11:45.880 --> 11:47.080]  We had preset settings.
[11:47.080 --> 11:48.080]  You set the computer.
[11:48.080 --> 11:50.560]  It's like saying, oh, the house is 70 degrees.
[11:50.560 --> 11:51.560]  I can't control it.
[11:51.560 --> 11:52.560]  It's a computer.
[11:52.560 --> 11:55.240]  You control the thermostat.
[11:55.240 --> 11:59.120]  So I said, oh, Goldman Sachs needs to be investigated.
[11:59.120 --> 12:04.800]  And others for setting the threshold very, very low.
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.160]  And by that, it barely drops, the threshold's very low to start mass selling.
[12:09.160 --> 12:11.240]  They had it on a hair trigger.
[12:11.240 --> 12:16.760]  Or you look at the other way and say it was set very, very high in a hair trigger where
[12:16.760 --> 12:17.760]  there was any drop.
[12:17.760 --> 12:18.760]  It happened.
[12:18.760 --> 12:19.760]  But I see it as low.
[12:19.760 --> 12:22.440]  If you want to set the threshold, we have to have a lot of drop.
[12:22.440 --> 12:23.440]  That's a high threshold.
[12:23.440 --> 12:25.480]  A low threshold is it barely drops.
[12:25.480 --> 12:27.360]  You start panic selling.
[12:27.360 --> 12:29.800]  Potato patata, it depends on how you want to look at it.
[12:29.800 --> 12:34.320]  It's the same thing, just different ways of looking at a glass half full, half empty.
[12:34.320 --> 12:36.880]  So we know that happened.
[12:36.880 --> 12:39.640]  And we know they've been cheerleading for the market to go down.
[12:39.640 --> 12:47.160]  But because of incredible exuberance, they've not been able to do it.
[12:47.160 --> 12:51.600]  So the media attacked me and said, Jones claims it's a conspiracy and that there's some type
[12:51.600 --> 12:53.080]  of hanky-panky going on.
[12:53.080 --> 12:57.080]  We all know big banks and brokerage firms never do anything in the stock market.
[12:57.080 --> 13:00.160]  It's completely above board.
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.280]  But meanwhile, today, the financial riders and many others are coming out and agreeing
[13:04.280 --> 13:08.400]  with what I said yesterday with Michael Sabich yesterday, that clearly this is an attack
[13:08.400 --> 13:09.400]  on Trump.
[13:09.400 --> 13:14.400]  Here it is from Michael Sabich on infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[13:14.400 --> 13:18.960]  Michael Sabich thinks stock market plunges a deep state plot to destroy Trump.
[13:18.960 --> 13:24.680]  We'll play a clip of that, but see, here's just one clip I found this morning, July 21st
[13:24.680 --> 13:30.680]  of last year, Federal Reserve attempted to kill Trump economic boom with their policies
[13:30.680 --> 13:34.080]  of raising interest rates then and talking down the economy.
[13:34.080 --> 13:40.680]  And I said he used to get rid of Yellen and put his own person in, but the Federal Reserve
[13:40.680 --> 13:41.680]  is private.
[13:41.680 --> 13:42.680]  It does what it wants.
[13:42.680 --> 13:43.680]  Okay.
[13:43.680 --> 13:46.240]  It's a fourth branch of government above the law that's not governmental in the words
[13:46.240 --> 13:47.240]  of Alan Greenspan.
[13:47.240 --> 13:49.280]  In fact, let's find that later.
[13:49.280 --> 13:50.280]  No rush.
[13:50.280 --> 13:56.320]  He was on PBS News Hour like seven years ago and he goes, well, the headline is Alan
[13:56.320 --> 13:59.200]  Greenspan says the Federal Reserve is above the law.
[13:59.200 --> 14:00.640]  He actually says it.
[14:00.640 --> 14:01.640]  No one can stop us.
[14:01.640 --> 14:05.840]  Not courts, not Congress, not the president, not the people since 1913.
[14:05.840 --> 14:07.840]  Now over a hundred years ago, we rule you.
[14:07.840 --> 14:09.360]  So here's Michael Sabich.
[14:09.360 --> 14:15.440]  And then when I come back, we'll play the clip from July, but here's Dr. Savage.
[14:15.440 --> 14:22.600]  The feds are doing this on purpose by running up interest rates to weaken Donald Trump, whose
[14:22.600 --> 14:25.520]  strongest calling card is the economy.
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.280]  Remember Trump triumphed over Mueller and the nation last week, weak, with the release
[14:30.280 --> 14:31.280]  of that memo.
[14:31.280 --> 14:33.840]  Never mind what little Adam Schiff says.
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.080]  Adam Schiff is a fraud, a phony, an empty suit.
[14:37.080 --> 14:40.240]  Robert Hall doesn't even have a suit that would fit him.
[14:40.240 --> 14:45.320]  They're trying to destroy Trump's strongest card, which is the economy.
[14:45.320 --> 14:49.240]  Mueller has gone nowhere with his fake Russia investigation.
[14:49.240 --> 14:56.960]  Trump's stirring so to speech last week was so great that even CBS admitted 75% of the
[14:56.960 --> 15:00.280]  people who watched it, approved of it and loved it.
[15:00.280 --> 15:02.520]  So what happened right afterwards?
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.600]  The establishment, meaning the deep state, call it whatever you want, went into overdrive
[15:07.600 --> 15:12.880]  to destroy Trump or try to destroy him where he is strongest because they couldn't get
[15:12.880 --> 15:14.960]  him where they thought he was weakest.
[15:14.960 --> 15:18.600]  And so they're taking the market down, they're trying to hurt you.
[15:18.600 --> 15:21.080]  They are the enemies of the average American.
[15:21.080 --> 15:23.920]  Make no mistake about it, they're going for you.
[15:23.920 --> 15:29.360]  These people are so evil and so power drunk that they'd burn the nation to the ground
[15:29.360 --> 15:32.680]  rather than let Donald Trump live another day in office.
[15:32.680 --> 15:35.600]  Do you understand this?
[15:35.600 --> 15:42.000]  Absolute pure truth, 100% truth, crystallized in a minute and a half as only Dr. Savage
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  can do it.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.480]  All the proof and now we predicted it and laid it all out on the other side and they've
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.200]  bragged about doing this as well because remember, they're just going to buy it up when it's
[15:50.200 --> 15:55.120]  low and jack it back up later, but it hurts you and the economy will be back.
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.760]  Stay with us.
[15:59.760 --> 16:04.760]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[16:04.760 --> 16:08.440]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[16:08.440 --> 16:13.440]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[16:13.440 --> 16:17.000]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.480]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[16:21.480 --> 16:22.480]  across America.
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.480]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.080]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[16:30.080 --> 16:31.080]  healthier I feel.

[18:13.360 --> 18:17.720]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.

[20:21.760 --> 20:33.800]  Big brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he it's Alex
[20:33.800 --> 21:00.600]  Jones on the GCN radio network.
[21:00.600 --> 21:08.840]  Ladies and gentlemen we are back live broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones.
[21:08.840 --> 21:12.240]  We're going to be here for the next three and a half hours and of course the war rooms
[21:12.240 --> 21:18.000]  coming up with Owen Schreuer as well.
[21:18.000 --> 21:32.840]  We are witnessing premeditated committed economic warfare
[21:32.840 --> 21:38.160]  against this country.
[21:38.160 --> 21:49.000]  The foreign governments and foreign empires are willing to take over countries and burn
[21:49.000 --> 21:57.560]  down whole cities and bomb entire nations for power and control.
[21:57.560 --> 22:00.640]  Would they be willing to assassinate a president?
[22:00.640 --> 22:02.840]  Would they be willing to start a race war?
[22:02.840 --> 22:08.280]  Would they be willing to try to tank a stock market to kill a recovery when their whole
[22:08.280 --> 22:12.800]  global system is based on bringing down the nation state?
[22:12.800 --> 22:16.000]  Well the answer is they wouldn't be willing.
[22:16.000 --> 22:27.040]  They would be committed to that and they would be carrying exactly that out.
[22:27.040 --> 22:29.560]  And that's what's happened.
[22:29.560 --> 22:30.560]  And they think you're stupid.
[22:30.560 --> 22:38.840]  The private run for profit Federal Reserve has raised interest rates more on President
[22:38.840 --> 22:46.000]  Trump and the American people in the last 13 months than it did in the entirety of eight
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.280]  years of Barack Hussein Obama.
[22:49.280 --> 22:54.960]  They gave low interest rates to the establishment but banks didn't give low interest rates to
[22:54.960 --> 22:56.480]  the citizens.
[22:56.480 --> 22:59.880]  Trump has instructed the banks to do so.
[22:59.880 --> 23:04.360]  The Federal Reserve has been bucking him but many regional and national banks have been
[23:04.360 --> 23:12.440]  loaning and that's why you've seen record new small company expansions and startups
[23:12.440 --> 23:18.640]  that we've ever seen, now even better than Ronald Reagan.
[23:18.640 --> 23:20.040]  So they've already raised it a bunch.
[23:20.040 --> 23:24.040]  Now they're raising it three more times in 2018.
[23:24.040 --> 23:37.160]  They announced that last Friday and on the next trading day the stock market fell thousands
[23:37.160 --> 23:42.480]  of points before rebounding a couple hundred points.
[23:42.480 --> 23:48.560]  And then I get up here on air and I talk about it and mainstream media says it's a conspiracy
[23:48.560 --> 23:52.480]  theory because they think you're stupid.
[23:52.480 --> 23:57.040]  You've seen CNBC, you've seen MSNBC, you've seen the New York Times, all talk down the
[23:57.040 --> 24:01.520]  market, all talk down the low unemployment, CNN, all of them tell you that the economy
[24:01.520 --> 24:05.440]  really isn't good and that it's underlying bad and that it's all going to explode, it's
[24:05.440 --> 24:06.760]  all a big bubble.
[24:06.760 --> 24:12.440]  They've been living off the bubble for themselves and not letting you have any of the bubble.
[24:12.440 --> 24:16.280]  They've gotten even richer under Trump last year.
[24:16.280 --> 24:23.400]  Bezos has made twenty something billion dollars but you notice he's been selling a lot of
[24:23.400 --> 24:29.600]  it and buying whole foods and buying newspapers and buying factories and buying, in fact the
[24:29.600 --> 24:34.800]  headline was last week, Bezos bought more last week than he bought the previous year.
[24:34.800 --> 24:42.440]  The headline was, I saw a bunch of headlines, Bezos buying everything, Bezos buying everything
[24:42.440 --> 24:47.720]  he can get his hands on because he knew they were getting ready to start bringing the stock
[24:47.720 --> 24:51.960]  market down this week.
[24:51.960 --> 24:57.400]  His whole empire is built on $1.48 on every package he ships a taxpayer money and almost
[24:57.400 --> 24:59.720]  all his employees are on food stamps.
[24:59.720 --> 25:04.680]  His whole system is about bringing us down.
[25:04.680 --> 25:09.680]  Now the whole foods workers are getting their pay cut and their hours increased and overtime
[25:09.680 --> 25:13.720]  taken away and the food's not going to be really organic anymore and they're shipping
[25:13.720 --> 25:20.600]  crap in and the shelves are empty at the time as it's just on time delivery.
[25:20.600 --> 25:24.320]  Driving workers to cry regularly just like the Washington Post, they hailed him two
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.800]  years ago when he bought it as the leftist savior.
[25:29.800 --> 25:34.120]  Now they walk into board meetings and say you all need to shut the bleep up.
[25:34.120 --> 25:39.760]  You're going to get your pay cut, a lot of you are going to be on the street.
[25:39.760 --> 25:43.280]  Phase one, we come in, we tell everything's great.
[25:43.280 --> 25:45.560]  Phase two, we gang rape you.
[25:45.560 --> 25:46.560]  I'm Bezos.
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.040]  I'm in league with Apple that's got the slave factories.
[25:50.040 --> 25:53.560]  But I'm trendy and that's all that matters.
[25:53.560 --> 25:58.640]  Long as you're at trendy, everything is A-O-K.
[25:58.640 --> 26:02.760]  So you could see them all maneuvering last week, selling, selling, selling, selling,
[26:02.760 --> 26:08.320]  selling at the peak and then bleep on Monday.
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.680]  And then they're going to panic everything further and tell Trump, you don't start working
[26:12.680 --> 26:16.600]  with us and rolling over, we're going to do the one thing you don't want and that's destroy
[26:16.600 --> 26:17.600]  America.
[26:17.600 --> 26:18.600]  Well, guess what?
[26:18.600 --> 26:20.920]  They're going to do it anyway.
[26:20.920 --> 26:28.720]  So let's go out to break here with a clip, Federal Reserve attempting to kill Trump
[26:28.720 --> 26:30.000]  economic recovery.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.080]  This was the six month anniversary of Trump being sworn in and here is my warning that
[26:35.080 --> 26:41.160]  came exactly true and of course we have them even admitting they're doing this.
[26:41.160 --> 26:44.000]  But in a mind game, then when you say something, they go, oh, no, we didn't do that.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.640]  Here it is.
[26:45.640 --> 26:53.120]  Today is the six month anniversary of his inauguration and his announcement to kill
[26:53.120 --> 27:00.200]  the TPP, to renegotiate NAFTA and GATT, to kill the carbon tax, to control our borders
[27:00.200 --> 27:04.400]  and he's delivered in a royal flush.
[27:04.400 --> 27:09.800]  But the headlines from CNN and the New York Times, the Washington Post, MSNBC, ABC, NBC,
[27:09.800 --> 27:15.360]  CBS is, Trump doesn't get one piece of major legislation through, Trump's a failure, Trump's
[27:15.360 --> 27:20.320]  in shambles, Trump's under criminal investigation.
[27:20.320 --> 27:26.800]  And yes, he hasn't gotten any major legislation, meaning cat tax cuts or Obamacare repeal through,
[27:26.800 --> 27:31.640]  but a lot of other stuff that is actually major has gotten through massive regulations
[27:31.640 --> 27:36.960]  cut and he's gotten so much done via the executive branch because they were unconstitutionally
[27:36.960 --> 27:42.480]  doing most of their globalist agenda through it, he was able to turn that back on them
[27:42.480 --> 27:49.080]  and kill it and then watch the economy go from sputtering and faltering and stalling
[27:49.080 --> 27:53.320]  and roaring back.
[27:53.320 --> 27:59.680]  And now the Federal Reserve announces huge increases coming in the next few months toward
[27:59.680 --> 28:09.040]  the previous increases of the amount of money you have to pay to borrow and as the interest
[28:09.040 --> 28:14.840]  increases it's a wet blanket trying to stop the American system that empires have been
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.680]  trying to stop for 242 years.
[28:19.680 --> 28:26.040]  This is an amazing time to be alive and I just tell it like it is ladies and gentlemen,
[28:26.040 --> 28:32.840]  Trump has delivered and it is just over the top bizarre to see all these liars and scumbags
[28:32.840 --> 28:39.440]  sit there and spew their lies with a straight face because it is so over the top ridiculous.
[28:39.440 --> 28:40.680]  That's right.
[28:40.680 --> 28:45.160]  When we saw the leftist media celebrate and go oh look the economy is going down, Trump
[28:45.160 --> 28:51.040]  was speaking in Ohio at a factory, he looks stupid, he's dumb, America is going down,
[28:51.040 --> 28:54.840]  down, down with America, oh but Trump is a Russian agent, he wants to hurt America but
[28:54.840 --> 28:59.600]  we're sharing against America because we're the globalist scum.
[28:59.600 --> 29:04.080]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs so you want to be sure it's the
[29:04.080 --> 29:06.320]  best for you and your family.

[31:15.160 --> 31:20.240]  This is pollen block, in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[31:20.240 --> 31:25.600]  quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny
[31:25.600 --> 31:31.560]  nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production, they began studying the effects
[31:31.560 --> 31:34.000]  in published trials, in their published trials.

[32:00.360 --> 32:05.360]  Former Facebook and Google employees are speaking out against what they say are societal dangers
[32:05.360 --> 32:07.800]  posed by social media and smartphones.
[32:07.800 --> 32:12.680]  The group recently formed the Center for Humane Technology and they're on a mission to highlight
[32:12.680 --> 32:17.160]  the ill effects associated with the very social networks they helped create.
[32:17.160 --> 32:22.240]  As part of their first campaign titled The Truth About Tech, the group will target 55,000
[32:22.240 --> 32:28.040]  U.S. public schools in an effort to warn students, teachers, and parents about tech addiction.
[32:28.040 --> 32:32.760]  Tristan Harris, a former ethicist at Google and head of the new group, says the largest
[32:32.760 --> 32:37.960]  supercomputers in the world are inside of two companies, Google and Facebook.
[32:37.960 --> 32:39.600]  And where are we pointing them?
[32:39.600 --> 32:41.760]  We're pointing them at people's brains.
[32:41.760 --> 32:46.440]  At Children, numerous studies have linked excessive technology use among children to
[32:46.440 --> 32:48.600]  depression and developmental issues.
[32:48.600 --> 32:53.960]  The Center for Humane Technology also hopes to develop a ledger of harms, a site to inform
[32:53.960 --> 32:57.320]  tech engineers who may be worried about what they're building.
[32:57.320 --> 33:14.160]  Liam McAdooInfoWars.com You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[33:14.160 --> 33:16.800]  Waging war on corruption.
[33:16.800 --> 33:30.920]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[33:30.920 --> 33:43.520]  So the Dow Jones industrial average to the great frustration of the globalist is up
[33:43.520 --> 33:51.640]  186 points from opening today, it's at 24,541, oscillating back and forth.
[33:51.640 --> 33:56.680]  Obviously it was up last week at 26,000 in the middle of the week, but then the feds
[33:56.680 --> 33:59.120]  said that they were going to raise interest rates.
[33:59.120 --> 34:04.560]  They gave their details on Friday and on Monday, the market went down almost 2,000 points.
[34:04.560 --> 34:08.560]  The biggest single day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average is history.
[34:08.560 --> 34:14.040]  It's still not a crash because it's gained close to 8,000 points since the president
[34:14.040 --> 34:20.640]  got in, or a 40% increase.
[34:20.640 --> 34:29.000]  So again, all of that is up on infowars.com and newswars.com as we speak.
[34:29.000 --> 34:35.760]  Now let's get into President Trump's greatest truth yet, because as the criminality of the
[34:35.760 --> 34:42.280]  globalist comes out, President Trump is really taking the gloves off with these people that
[34:42.280 --> 34:47.640]  believe they've captured America once and for good and believe that the huge populist
[34:47.640 --> 34:55.160]  free market awakening is only a death struggle, a death agony that the vampires will be able
[34:55.160 --> 34:56.160]  to sit on.
[34:56.160 --> 35:03.120]  If enough of them sit on, it's like Liliputians and keep us from getting back on our feet.
[35:03.120 --> 35:07.840]  But we have gotten back on our feet, and as more Americans wake up to that fact, we will
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.120]  reverse the trends that they have been engaged in.
[35:12.120 --> 35:19.920]  So Trump's biggest truth yet, Democrats are like death, un-American and treasonous.
[35:19.920 --> 35:21.920]  We're going to go to that clip in a moment.
[35:21.920 --> 35:26.800]  Trump turns up the heat on un-American nymphs silent during the State of the Union.
[35:26.800 --> 35:28.480]  Can we call that treason?
[35:28.480 --> 35:30.920]  It certainly shows they're out to get the country.
[35:30.920 --> 35:36.120]  What MSNBC said, you can't have churches and you can't have family.
[35:36.120 --> 35:38.560]  We took that away from you.
[35:38.560 --> 35:40.480]  That's a bygone era.
[35:40.480 --> 35:43.640]  The state is your family.
[35:43.640 --> 35:48.600]  So all of it out in the open, as the globalist admittedly plunge the stock market for full
[35:48.600 --> 35:49.600]  control.
[35:49.600 --> 35:53.560]  Let's go to the President.
[35:53.560 --> 35:59.440]  But I said we have the lowest black unemployment in the history of our country.
[35:59.440 --> 36:04.280]  It was like, it was a game, you know, they play games.
[36:04.280 --> 36:07.480]  They were told, don't even make a facial movement.
[36:07.480 --> 36:13.440]  And I'm talking about, you have the lowest Hispanic unemployment in the history of our
[36:13.440 --> 36:14.440]  country.
[36:14.440 --> 36:17.640]  This isn't me saying, this is the charts, the polls.
[36:17.640 --> 36:23.000]  We have the lowest in the history of our country, dead silence, not a smile.
[36:23.000 --> 36:30.080]  In fact, there was one guy when I said the lowest African American unemployment, he was
[36:30.080 --> 36:36.520]  sort of clapping like, who was that guy, he's a nice guy, he was a reverend.
[36:36.520 --> 36:41.720]  And he was, I wouldn't say it was exactly a rousing, but he, he was putting his hands
[36:41.720 --> 36:42.720]  together.
[36:42.720 --> 36:46.440]  And I want to find out who he is, I'm going to send him a letter of thank you.
[36:46.440 --> 36:50.080]  And he was probably severely reprimanded, don't you think Rob?
[36:50.080 --> 36:53.240]  I think so, because he was the only one.
[36:53.240 --> 37:00.080]  So that means they would rather see Trump do badly, okay, than our country do well.
[37:00.080 --> 37:01.080]  That's what it means.
[37:01.080 --> 37:03.600]  It's very selfish.
[37:03.600 --> 37:10.160]  And it got to a point where I really didn't even want to look too much during the speech
[37:10.160 --> 37:13.200]  over to that side, because honestly, it was bad energy.
[37:13.200 --> 37:16.160]  No, it was bad energy.
[37:16.160 --> 37:22.400]  You're up there, you've got half the room going totally crazy wild, they loved everything,
[37:22.400 --> 37:25.280]  they want to do something great for our country.
[37:25.280 --> 37:31.920]  And you have the other side, even on positive news, really positive news, like that, they
[37:31.920 --> 37:35.360]  were like death.
[37:35.360 --> 37:44.560]  And un-American, un-American, somebody said treasonous, I mean, yeah, I guess why not?
[37:44.560 --> 37:48.080]  So we call that treason, why not?
[37:48.080 --> 37:53.400]  I mean, they certainly didn't love our country very much.
[37:53.400 --> 37:58.640]  But you look at that and it's really very, very sad.
[37:58.640 --> 38:02.960]  So we have to keep it going because this country is turning and it's turning much faster.
[38:02.960 --> 38:07.920]  And I said, I'm going to do it, but it's happening faster than I thought.
[38:07.920 --> 38:12.520]  And then I saw the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN talking point.
[38:12.520 --> 38:16.720]  By the time I went and picked my kids up from school and got home yesterday, I went to home
[38:16.720 --> 38:20.240]  early yesterday, I was already planning to go get them out for school and take them out
[38:20.240 --> 38:23.360]  to eat and stuff and then go home and hang out.
[38:23.360 --> 38:29.320]  By the time I got home at about six o'clock after picking them up and going to early dinner,
[38:29.320 --> 38:37.080]  there was the talking points in my office on the two computers, the same talking point.
[38:37.080 --> 38:44.040]  The embarrassing split screen, while Trump talks that the economy's up, it's plunging.
[38:44.040 --> 38:48.360]  And then it showed photos of him giving the speech in Ohio at the factory and then it
[38:48.360 --> 38:50.800]  showed shots of the stock market going down.
[38:50.800 --> 38:58.040]  And it was just like growing up where you'd see ABC, CBS and NBC all with the same teleprompter
[38:58.040 --> 39:01.600]  news in the same order for 30 minutes every night.
[39:01.600 --> 39:05.640]  And it'd be the same ads a lot of times during the breaks, totally programmed and it was
[39:05.640 --> 39:08.480]  the same deal.
[39:08.480 --> 39:09.480]  Trump's embarrassed.
[39:09.480 --> 39:14.040]  He's talking up the economy, but it's not good.
[39:14.040 --> 39:18.320]  Even though you have the job startups and the wages going up and the tax cuts and the
[39:18.320 --> 39:21.920]  bonuses, they go, oh, a lot of blacks are out of the workforce.
[39:21.920 --> 39:25.280]  So that's why it's the lowest unemployment ever.
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.720]  No, you look at the index, those working are at the highest index since they set up the
[39:30.720 --> 39:35.120]  labor bureau statistics and the wages are much higher, which is the argument of the
[39:35.120 --> 39:38.640]  Federal Reserve to raise interest rates saying wages are too high.
[39:38.640 --> 39:40.440]  That's going to cause inflation.
[39:40.440 --> 39:43.960]  When we all know they're not too high, they're still way too low because of how inflation
[39:43.960 --> 39:44.960]  is.
[39:44.960 --> 39:48.200]  Let me tell you, I'm not a rich guy, but I got some money and I go buy groceries and
[39:48.200 --> 39:50.880]  stuff and I'm like, it hurts.
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.640]  I'm like, how does an average family do this?
[39:54.640 --> 39:55.960]  Inflation's been incredible.
[39:55.960 --> 39:58.920]  Trump's going, well, we're in inflation because of globalism.
[39:58.920 --> 40:02.560]  Might as well give them pay raises, at least they can buy some more stuff because he's
[40:02.560 --> 40:06.640]  damned if he does, he's damned if he doesn't.
[40:06.640 --> 40:10.920]  And it made me really angry because then I said, okay, they're not all rooting against
[40:10.920 --> 40:11.920]  the economy.
[40:11.920 --> 40:16.000]  And I kept looking and looking and remembering back how they kept saying, oh, the stock market's
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  going to go down.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.040]  Oh, these factory jobs aren't going to come back.
[40:19.040 --> 40:21.840]  Oh, you'll never get to 3% growth rate.
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.720]  And it's just how they're squatting on this country trying to hold us down while they
[40:26.720 --> 40:32.000]  cheerlead and say the Chinese century's here and China's invincible and China's
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  unstoppable.
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  And it's the future.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  Let me tell you something.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  Paul Watson was married to a Chinese lady for about five years.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  Nicely.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.640]  I met her a couple times, nicely.
[40:41.640 --> 40:49.480]  But the point is, is that he went over there many times to hang out with her family.
[40:49.480 --> 40:53.920]  He said, even in the wealthy areas, even the rural areas, just black smog comes by and
[40:53.920 --> 40:54.920]  hits you in the face.
[40:54.920 --> 40:57.080]  And that's why they wear masks and there's incredible corruption.
[40:57.080 --> 41:00.400]  There'll be dead bodies just rotting on the side of the road.
[41:00.400 --> 41:06.600]  And people crapping on the side of the street and no one helps you if you get hurt.
[41:06.600 --> 41:10.680]  And they sell political dissidents organs because their crime is secretly having a church
[41:10.680 --> 41:17.360]  or secretly, you know, doing feng shui or any type of other, that's Japanese, any type
[41:17.360 --> 41:21.960]  of Buddhist operation.
[41:21.960 --> 41:24.360]  It's just crazy.
[41:24.360 --> 41:26.440]  And the left doesn't say a word about it now.
[41:26.440 --> 41:27.520]  They don't care.
[41:27.520 --> 41:29.160]  It's no big deal.
[41:29.160 --> 41:32.360]  And Trump's really starting to become himself now behind the scenes.
[41:32.360 --> 41:37.440]  I told you, he likes Christianity because the energy, he feels the spirit of it.
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.640]  And you heard him though, the energy was really bad over there.
[41:40.640 --> 41:42.200]  The energy over here was really great.
[41:42.200 --> 41:44.880]  That's what Trump's really all about is energy.
[41:44.880 --> 41:47.840]  And he doesn't like seeing poor, starving, dumb people.
[41:47.840 --> 41:49.960]  He doesn't like seeing no opportunity.
[41:49.960 --> 41:53.200]  He likes seeing people working hard, being empowered, being successful.
[41:53.200 --> 41:59.600]  And that spirit of Trump is antithetical to the globalist.
[41:59.600 --> 42:00.800]  It's the opposite of who they are.
[42:00.800 --> 42:03.360]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[42:03.360 --> 42:07.160]  I'm going to come back and get into huge news.
[42:07.160 --> 42:10.800]  Where did you hear first that the real crimes committed at the Justice Department were paying
[42:10.800 --> 42:13.720]  off their family members at Fusion GPS?
[42:13.720 --> 42:15.560]  Congress talked about it last night.
[42:15.560 --> 42:21.000]  When we come back, I'm going to read the news and then I'm going to give you from December
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.160]  of last year, three months ago, where I said it was the key to everything.
[42:25.160 --> 42:28.920]  Just pointing out why they hate us, why they say we're the number one enemy to be shut
[42:28.920 --> 42:32.760]  down in congressional hearings, why Google internally says it, why foreign governments
[42:32.760 --> 42:37.920]  want to shut down, why the Communist Chinese openly want to shut down, because we got their
[42:37.920 --> 42:38.920]  number.
[42:38.920 --> 42:42.520]  I told you years ago that the University of Texas is run by the Communist Chinese.
[42:42.520 --> 42:46.480]  Two weeks ago, it was the front page of even the Washington Post had to admit it.
[42:46.480 --> 42:52.040]  These intelligence was caught running the University, basically, and just jacking all
[42:52.040 --> 42:54.560]  the DARPA data.
[42:54.560 --> 42:59.440]  Stay where there's tomorrow's news today.

[48:23.480 --> 48:29.920]  raising rates, knowing it would do that, then hyping it, and then having their trading systems
[48:29.920 --> 48:37.480]  preset to begin to lower the value.
[48:37.480 --> 48:45.600]  Now, we have a lot of news coming in that we're going to be breaking down as it unfolds,
[48:45.600 --> 48:47.160]  but here's a headline.
[48:47.160 --> 48:52.640]  The Federal Reserve may secretly want to sink the record-breaking stock market, and that's
[48:52.640 --> 49:02.680]  from the street, the street, one of the even big establishment publications, and that's
[49:02.680 --> 49:04.560]  Peter Schiff saying that.
[49:04.560 --> 49:10.000]  We'll play some of that video coming up at the start of the next hour, and Peter Schiff
[49:10.000 --> 49:17.120]  is going to be joining us on air, and he was on with us just two weeks ago and was predicting
[49:17.120 --> 49:22.560]  all of this, but he's saying it's bad if they try to crash it on their own, but it's healthy
[49:22.560 --> 49:28.560]  because bubbles are bad, yeah, but then the Chinese, everybody else, have their bubbles.
[49:28.560 --> 49:32.680]  So that is coming up.
[49:32.680 --> 49:38.600]  At the bottom of the next hour, you definitely do not want to miss that.
[49:38.600 --> 49:49.120]  I want to get to the latest that is unfolding with the whole situation, with Mueller and
[49:49.120 --> 49:53.480]  the ridiculous Russian probe and all the rest of it, and the media trying to say, the
[49:53.480 --> 50:00.000]  control corporate press trying to say, it's treason if you even expose the fact that they've
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.240]  got fraudulent evidence that are engaged in fraud, and they're trying to feed the public
[50:04.240 --> 50:09.840]  fruit of the poison tree, and then it's all based on lies.
[50:09.840 --> 50:13.560]  So we're going to be going to all of that in just a moment, but I wanted to review the
[50:13.560 --> 50:24.480]  crimes that have been committed on the face of it, prima facie, that means you catch somebody
[50:24.480 --> 50:29.840]  with the dead body, and there's a witness that saw them stabbing them with the knife,
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.600]  or you catch somebody in the act of shooting somebody in front of a sports stadium, it's
[50:34.600 --> 50:36.960]  prima facie.
[50:36.960 --> 50:44.400]  And you have Justice Department officials giving money directly to their spouses because there's
[50:44.400 --> 50:51.320]  multiple ones that then quarterback creating the fake dossier and giving them a fancy French
[50:51.320 --> 50:52.320]  name.
[50:52.320 --> 50:55.280]  So everybody is wowed about it.
[50:55.280 --> 51:04.480]  Congress, Nunes didn't call it the dossier or the Bible, he just called it a memo, a
[51:04.480 --> 51:09.120]  FISA memo off what they did with the FISA court, the proof of the entire fraud and how
[51:09.120 --> 51:11.560]  they lied to the FISA court, which is another serious crime.
[51:11.560 --> 51:16.480]  So that's coming up in a moment, but briefly, we've got all these new initiatives that I've
[51:16.480 --> 51:19.800]  been so busy, I haven't even promoted.
[51:19.800 --> 51:23.400]  Things like Patriot Points at infowarstore.com.
[51:23.400 --> 51:33.880]  When you go to infowarstore.com and buy products, you get 5% off all the other additional purchases
[51:33.880 --> 51:39.000]  on your next purchase for every dollar you spend, which can be substantive.
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  You're buying high quality water filtration, air filtration, supplements monthly, that
[51:44.000 --> 51:50.080]  just in your account, you've got the high tech best type of shopping cart out there,
[51:50.080 --> 51:55.400]  it then builds up to very, very substantive amounts of money.
[51:55.400 --> 51:59.760]  And so just remember though, you've got to click Patriot Points when you're there shopping
[51:59.760 --> 52:05.640]  as you can anonymously shop or you can create your account with one click and you can again
[52:05.640 --> 52:11.000]  get those Patriot Points, so be sure and infowarstore.com to check those out.
[52:11.000 --> 52:17.480]  Also, you get additional 10% off on all orders when you sign a Ferato ship and then re-ship
[52:17.480 --> 52:22.760]  every 15, every 30, every 60, every 90, or every 6 months, you can cancel for free with
[52:22.760 --> 52:23.760]  one click.
[52:23.760 --> 52:30.080]  So to explain, you can go in and sign a Ferato ship for say DNA Force Plus, which is Cell
[52:30.080 --> 52:35.800]  Force but it's coming out in the term DNA Force Plus, or Brain Force, or Bodies, Ultimate
[52:35.800 --> 52:42.480]  Turmeric Formula, or Pollen Block, or BioTruth Selenium, or Secret 12, or the Real Red Pill,
[52:42.480 --> 52:48.880]  or Colloidal Silver, or Super Blue, fluoride-free, toothpaste that is 4 to 5 with high-quality
[52:48.880 --> 52:53.280]  colloidal silver and iodine, people love it, so good for the gums, knockout, the great
[52:53.280 --> 53:00.840]  sleep aid, vitamin mineral fusion, caveman, fluorolife, incredible probiotic, prostagard,
[53:00.840 --> 53:05.080]  same price as other sawpomato products that are great, proven to help you prostate other
[53:05.080 --> 53:11.320]  glands but with a bunch of other stuff that also turbocharges it for less money.
[53:11.320 --> 53:16.200]  You get an additional 10% off at checkout and then you can cancel right after checkout
[53:16.200 --> 53:18.160]  if you want.
[53:18.160 --> 53:22.400]  It's just to habituate, and I do this too, because I have the warehouse a few miles away
[53:22.400 --> 53:27.000]  and I go get whatever I want whenever I want, and I'll still run out of things like knockout
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.040]  or I'll run out of things like Secret 12, I'll run out of stuff like X2, the high-quality
[53:31.040 --> 53:34.840]  pure iodine, it's so good, and then I'll be forgetting to go get it.
[53:34.840 --> 53:40.280]  So I just auto ship to my house, my wife asked me about a year ago, she said, because that's
[53:40.280 --> 53:43.760]  when we got married, a little over a year ago, she said, honey, why are we getting
[53:43.760 --> 53:47.480]  info wars stuff from Austin, why are you buying your own stuff?
[53:47.480 --> 53:52.120]  And I said, well, I have to go sign out of inventory anyway, it's a big hassle, or somebody's
[53:52.120 --> 53:55.360]  got to bring it to me over here at the other office, and I said, so what if I'm putting
[53:55.360 --> 53:57.960]  money back in the company, it's here, isn't it?
[53:57.960 --> 54:01.200]  She said, no, yeah, you're right, I said, you were complaining that I wasn't bringing
[54:01.200 --> 54:03.000]  home enough knockout because you love it.
[54:03.000 --> 54:09.520]  I said, eight bottles, sweetheart, by the way, about a year and a half later, about 14 months
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.720]  later, we finally just killed that, and again, I didn't sign up for auto ship on that, I
[54:13.720 --> 54:17.800]  just had a whole bunch said to me, but I need to do the auto ship.
[54:17.800 --> 54:21.000]  In fact, I was just remembering, why am I ordering online?
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.920]  I need to auto ship myself, see, so something in there is on auto ship, I think it's what
[54:25.920 --> 54:30.320]  the kids take, secret 12, high-quality, vitamin B12.
[54:30.320 --> 54:37.080]  The point is infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple A 253-3139, and for a limited time,
[54:37.080 --> 54:40.200]  it is selling out in the next week or so.
[54:40.200 --> 54:46.320]  Shell Force is stronger bio, PQQ, CoQ10, more of it, it's basically souped up DNA Force
[54:46.320 --> 54:50.840]  at a lower price we were able to negotiate with a top organic producer, and Group said,
[54:50.840 --> 54:56.880]  listen, we're already putting out DNA Force Plus that was supposedly, you're gonna have
[54:56.880 --> 55:00.520]  even more in it for a lower price, but I can't even negotiate stuff like you did, we'll just,
[55:00.520 --> 55:03.560]  I'll stop making it, you know, this new firm you've got, it's a great formula, that's
[55:03.560 --> 55:09.760]  how classy Group is, so it is 53% off known as Shell Force, it's really gonna be called
[55:09.760 --> 55:14.920]  DNA Force Plus when we remake it, it's being remade right now, we should get more, we think
[55:14.920 --> 55:19.400]  in probably April, but I still want to discount at this great price for you, leading competitors
[55:19.400 --> 55:25.280]  are up to $300 or more, medical doctors sell it, people think they're getting a good deal,
[55:25.280 --> 55:31.600]  they go in, oh my gosh, it's CoQ10, it's bio, PQQ, the actual organically produced type,
[55:31.600 --> 55:36.560]  you can't call it organic, but it's not synthetic, okay, so it's organically produced, it's
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.840]  not synthetic, but you can't call it organic because it's produced in a laboratory using
[55:41.840 --> 55:47.720]  organic means, using bacteria, so the point is, is that the Japanese developed it, it's
[55:47.720 --> 55:53.600]  amazing, just the CoQ10 alone, Bio, PQQ, it's been all the rage for a decade for a reason,
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.000]  this is the strongest, lowest price formula you're gonna find out there, they've got,
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.440]  50, 60, 70 bucks for little bitty plastic bottles of just Bio, PQQ or CoQ10 that's synthetic
[56:02.440 --> 56:09.200]  and the evidence shows doesn't absorb at all, if any, and it's the same price as this,
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.840]  it's a big old horse pill in powdered form, incredibly absorbable with a bunch of other
[56:13.840 --> 56:19.280]  key compounds in it that help supercharge the absorption, and it's got five stars, even
[56:19.280 --> 56:24.640]  though this is a brand new product, Cell Force, gonna be relabeled, when the next deal comes
[56:24.640 --> 56:32.560]  out as DNA Force Plus, people like that name, I did it, not to step on Grips toes, M4store.com,

[57:21.560 --> 57:26.520]  exactly what I'm saying, this could be an inside operation, well it is clearly, you

[59:53.480 --> 01:00:14.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:26.160]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:33.320]  The feds are doing this on purpose by running up interest rates to weaken Donald Trump, whose
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.200]  strongest calling card is the economy.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:41.280]  Remember Trump triumphed over Mueller and the nation last week with the release of that
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280]  memo.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.720]  Never mind what little Adam Schiff says, Adam Schiff is a fraud, a phony, an empty suit.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.960]  Robert Hall doesn't have a suit that would fit him.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.800]  They're trying to destroy Trump's strongest card, which is the economy.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.920]  Mueller has gone nowhere with his fake Russia investigation.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:07.680]  Trump's stirring so-to-speech last week was so great that even CBS admitted 75% of the
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.960]  people who watched it, approved of it and loved it.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.200]  So what happened right afterwards?
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.320]  The establishment, meaning the deep state, called it whatever you want, went into overdrive
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.560]  to destroy Trump or try to destroy him where he is strongest because they couldn't get
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.640]  him where they thought he was weakest.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.280]  And so they're taking the market down, they're trying to hurt you.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.720]  They are the enemies of the average American.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.600]  Make no mistake about it, they're going for you.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.000]  These people are so evil and so power drunk that they'd burn the nation to the ground
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.320]  rather than let Donald Trump live another day in office.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.360]  Do you understand this?
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.680]  The globalists are so power drunk they'd rather burn the nation to the ground than
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.040]  let Donald Trump spend one more day in the Oval Office.
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040]  Total truth.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.880]  I don't hardly ever play clips twice, but I already played that last hour.
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.400]  I had to play the game because it's so true.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.760]  I just got pollaxed during that last two-minute break in between the first and second hour.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.960]  By information, I just learned from one of our investigative journalists that I have
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:14.360]  to go to a few clips at this point and I'm going to have to come back to break the news
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:21.880]  that we're about to break here on air that is devastating, devastating to Hollywood.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.400]  Devastating, devastating.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:37.640]  And I mean, it's rare that news is show over the top that I even have trouble dealing with
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:43.600]  it.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.680]  It's just these people.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:49.560]  It'll be breaking in the next 10 minutes here on air.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:55.600]  And then at infowars.com and newswars.com, and it makes me sick, but it also is very
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.240]  positive at the same time to be exposing the Siebel.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:03.360]  Let's play a clip back from December 14th where I said, Fusen GPS could have been trying
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.520]  to buy access to DOJ with payments to an official's wife.
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.600]  Well, it's kind of the reverse.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:10.280]  That's what judicial watching.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.480]  That's what daily callers saying.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:14.760]  It's this all one group.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:19.760]  She went to work there and then the money was paid, yes, to her, to Orr.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.160]  That's how Orr made the payment to his wife, to himself.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.320]  And then it's all one big incestuous relationship.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.880]  So yes, that's true, but it goes both ways.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.760]  So here's a clip of where I broke that down and we'll go to break and come back and then
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.000]  I'll try to compose myself, stay with us.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.320]  Then of course they had the hearing just on Wednesday, where he's in the meeting quarter
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:44.040]  backing how to bring down Trump during the election and saying, don't panic, we're going
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.840]  to defeat him.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.000]  And then they run the whole fake fusion GPS deal and they got the Justice Department paying
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.320]  millions to the wife of the head of the Justice Department, Russia unit.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:04.800]  I mean, total collusion, this is as bad as Hitler sitting in judgment of the Nazis in
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.640]  Nuremberg.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:15.280]  I mean, this is, whoa, this is so over the top, arrogant, belligerent, hubris filled,
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:24.520]  Hutzpah filled, bravado filled, the arrogance, the recklessness, the fake confidence that
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.280]  criminals and scum and betas engage him when, when, when betas finally get in a man's world
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.720]  and get together as a group of betas and start engaging in criminal activity, they just do
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.960]  things alphas would never do.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.840]  I just, I, I keep learning that it's betas who are the ones that get together and commit
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:47.400]  the really big crimes and they're all a bunch of chicken neck, anti-American trash.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.360]  I mean, you read their emails, their texts.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.320]  I mean, these are people that have a big giant, you know what, for America and just hate
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.920]  flyover country and hate bitter clingers and hate Christians and just, you know, I've
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.760]  got some talking points here about caveman from infowarslife.com, but instead of going
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.160]  with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:11.680]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.400]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:21.440]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works and there's no way to quantify
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.560]  how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:32.400]  of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.480]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:48.440]  is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there and it's amazing.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.640]  Check it out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com, what it can do for your family and again,
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:06:18.840]  I want to thank you all for your support, you are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:32.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:39.760]  This happens only every once in a while that a story so big hits my desk from our incredible
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:47.880]  investigative journalist that it gives me a migraine headache and I'm not complaining.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:55.400]  I instantly, within about two minutes of looking at this information, got a splitting headache,
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:07:02.360]  a vision blurring headache and I only have migraines maybe twice a year because it's
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:08.120]  so horrible and because it just confirms everything, you think I'd be jumping up and
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:09.120]  down happy.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:15.800]  No, I'm not happy and then I already had a stack of news on this subject to hit today
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:23.560]  and I'm being persecuted by these people behind the scenes and I can't get into it yet and
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:33.840]  I'm not complaining, it's just we're right about this and they're not going to give us
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:40.160]  quarter for folks that aren't into old fashioned history quarter means you're getting a fight
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:49.360]  with somebody, it's to the death, they're not going away, they're not stopping and they
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.960]  really are as bad as we thought they were, in fact, they're worse so I'm not ready to
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:05.200]  go to this at this point and we are going over it to remove some of the profanities
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:20.360]  in it and then I'm going to air it the next segment.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:26.640]  So that's coming up in a minute, I taste blood in my mouth, you know what I'm talking
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:35.320]  about, copper right now as a parent and I know what it is, it's my natural inclination
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:41.480]  if I was in a village 10,000 years ago there were people like this, they wouldn't be doing
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:47.440]  too well real fast and I'm not somebody that shoots my mouth off, everybody knows that,
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.960]  we're changing the world and I don't even like talking like this, it's just at a certain
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:09:01.360]  point, it never ends, you know I haven't gotten to one-tenth of bombshells yet today, these
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:07.040]  are the type of bombshells that are on info wars.com, just sensational beyond knowing,
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:12.440]  Adam Schiff the guy leading take America down operations up to his eyeballs with the Russians,
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.520]  caught trying to cover up and obstruct criminal investigations of Hillary, caught trying to
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:22.320]  block the criminal activity of fusion GPS, he's now come out and says Russians promote
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.480]  the second amendment so Americans would kill each other, that's right, Adam Schiff the
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:32.720]  second amendment is a Russian conspiracy, the stock market ups a Russian conspiracy,
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.840]  taking care of the veterans a Russian conspiracy, having the biggest small business startups
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.160]  in modern histories, a Russian conspiracy, having the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:50.920]  ever recorded is a conspiracy of the Russians, no you are the conspiracy of Hollywood and
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:10:01.800]  the whole stinking thing, and we've got the reports coming up that the Federal Reserve
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:08.160]  may secretly want to sink the record breaking stock market, oh that's the street, I said
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:14.360]  that last night, now you got CNBC and everybody else saying we're going to play that video
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:21.920]  when Schiff comes on with us at the bottom of the hour, and again I just keep showing
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:25.880]  you how we say it first and that's why they fear us and why they hate us, because I'm
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:32.760]  not a follower, I don't sit around and wait for somebody else to do it, now before we
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.640]  go any further and I play some of these clips, I'm going to play these clips back to back
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.120]  because I've got to go work on some things during the break and just get my head together
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:46.960]  before I come back and cover this, this big breaking news is going to break in about eight
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:53.400]  nine minutes at infowars.com and newswars.com and prisonplanet.com, but boy did Trump say
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:59.320]  it right when he said Democrats are like death, all those that hate me love death, that's
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:10.000]  their cult, that's their spirit, so Christ said they're like death, un-American and treasonous.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.200]  Like Savage said, total veritas, the insiders want to burn it all down if they can't control
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.800]  it, and Trump's trying to give us the keys back, I respect you, I believe in you, you're
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:30.640]  amazing, America's amazing, I love the energy of America, I'm in the cult of America, globalist
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:37.560]  go he's mentally ill, he's crazy, what, betting on the best horse the world ever saw, no I
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:43.640]  think he'd be crazy to join you death lovers, who love communist China, that's like a freak
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:48.560]  azoid science fiction nightmare that killed 80 plus million of its own people and kills
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.440]  hundreds of thousands a year conservatively right now and keeps people in cages DNA tested
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:12:04.040]  to sell their organs that did nothing, that's lovers of death right there, so rolling over
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:14.280]  to you is like death, so we're going to play Adam Schiff Russians promoting the second
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.680]  amendment so Americans will kill each other and then I'm going to play the rest of the
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.760]  clip I didn't get to all of it, flashback they're now saying go after or for giving
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.520]  his wife millions of dollars from the justice department as a type of double-sided payoff
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:33.080]  that you can only do if your husband and wife doing something like that, it's just to pay
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.440]  off, it's a kickback, it's unbelievable, let's go ahead and play both of those clips
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:42.920]  back to back that will come back with a bomb show, but we can see for example on Facebook
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:48.200]  so graphically what I was mentioning earlier the multiple aims of the Russians no proof
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:55.160]  no nothing you just lie you just say this, the content that was clearly anti-Hillary
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:00.120]  and you had the content clearly pause sorry all anti-Hillary stuff was a Russian buy that's
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.760]  all lies it's all it's been proven to be lies he just lies to people here go back to Jeff
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:10.160]  Bezos's Washington Post let's go back to the Washington Post here, but even the bigger
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:16.280]  quantity of content that was being pushed through social media was just content designed
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.280]  to pit us against each other to exploit our divisions oh the race and all that stuff like
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:27.680]  you do of course they as you have seen they parroted black lives matter to try to broaden
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:35.440]  the racial divide you guys funded that fascinatingly they also trumpeted the second amendment apparently
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:39.880]  the Russians are very big fans of our second amendment they don't particularly want a second
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.120]  amendment of their own yes they do but they're really glad that we have one the Russians
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.080]  would be thrilled if we were doing nothing but killing each other every day and sadly
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:57.080]  we are here I am getting into December what's now breaking go ahead of course at the hearings
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:03.920]  yesterday on Wednesday where he's in the meetings quarterbacking how to bring down Trump during
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.160]  the election and saying don't panic we're going to defeat him and then they run the whole
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:16.760]  fake fusion GPS deal and they got the Justice Department paying millions to the wife of
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:24.040]  the head of the Justice Department Russia unit I mean total collusion this is as bad
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:33.360]  as Hitler sitting in judgment of the Nazis in Nuremberg I mean this is whoa this is so
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:42.280]  over the top arrogant belligerent hubris filled hutzpah filled bravada filled the arrogance
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:50.480]  the the recklessness the fake confidence that criminals and scum and betas engage in when
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.520]  a when when betas finally get in a man's world and get together as a group of betas
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:15:00.000]  and start engaging in criminal activity they just do things alphas would never do I just
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.640]  I I keep learning that it's betas who are the ones that get together and commit early
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.840]  big crimes and they're all about the chicken neck anti-american trash I mean you read their

[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.480]  it's what criminals do they always demonize who they're robbing and they always think
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:44.440]  they're invincible until they get caught robbing but it gets worse you've got the FBI giving
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:50.720]  millions of dollars with McCabe directing it behind the scenes during the campaign against
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.240]  Trump in emails and text messages saying don't worry we're gonna stop Trump and we're gonna

[01:19:50.480 --> 01:20:03.800]  now and for us live calm secure yours today you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:44.720]  Alex Jones here back live with a piece of news that makes me particularly angry in fact
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:50.460]  it it makes me taste copper in my mouth and that happens very very rarely unless I get
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:57.600]  mad at a very deep fundamental level and then I ask myself why did this piece of news trigger
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:04.280]  me so hard well you're about to learn for yourself because I have a stack of news today
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:08.880]  that ties into this same subject and then when I listened to what this individual had
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:16.240]  to say and read the transcript as well in the Kit Daniels article on info wars dot com
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:23.440]  and news wars dot com it was so sickening to hear how he was talking and I'm talking
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:34.160]  about Quentin Tarantino defended Roman Polanski's pedophilic rape of a drug 13 year old girl
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:39.280]  and said sex with a 13 year old girl isn't rape and he was of course best buddies with
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:45.400]  Weinstein and the two party together for years and he financed almost all of his race
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:57.520]  baiting sex war films so there you go info wars dot com and it shocked even Howard Stern
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:06.240]  in an interview from 2003 the full interview is posted on info wars dot com in the article
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.440]  but remember we have Meryl Streep saying Roman Polanski shouldn't be in jail for raping a
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.080]  13 year old or then he got in trouble for Europe for other stuff and they finally got
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:19.520]  him before he was in jail years before that she was in the early 2000s giving standing
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:25.600]  ovations when he was still winning best director from the academy and he was known for all
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.120]  of this and there's the reports of all the rape by Weinstein and the underage girls
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:41.440]  as well but don't worry as you're going to hear from Quentin Tarantino it's all okay
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.120]  even though he introduced us to images of men raping men and Pulp Fitch had made it cute
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:51.600]  and funny and what gimps were and sex slaves and boxes and all this you know fun stuff
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.480]  if you get kidnapped and put in a box you'll think it's cool too where's the gimp I think
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:02.840]  he's sleeping you'll just have to wake him up now won't you and so in real life that's
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:10.000]  who Tarantino is it looks like is Zed and you know what happens to old Zed in Tarantino's
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:18.520]  movie so Piper's come along so here we are ladies and gentlemen with him saying oh she
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:23.280]  was 13 it was consensual oh because she was drugged up kind of like a 20 year old woman
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:29.160]  you drug her up so here they are pushing this whole movement and he's got Uma Thurmer coming
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:34.080]  out who knew about all this forever too they had her crashing in cars they spit on her
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.960]  Tarantino's defending that now but now that she's not a big star anymore she wants to
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.160]  get 10 more minutes of fame you should have talked about it back at the time lady that's
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:47.000]  all I'm saying I'm not comparing you to monsters like Weinstein or Tarantino but man let me
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.040]  tell you I know a lot of folks from Hollywood Tarantino's lived in Austin for 16 years he
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:24:02.520]  doesn't like me he's come right over and told me my face arrogant old cuss I won't tell
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:07.280]  the rest of story because it's too unbelievable but let's go ahead now ladies and gentlemen
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.440]  it was yet the French connection when the director was there also the director of the
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:16.160]  actress the same guy it was there back when Elmle Draft House was one movie theater downtown
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:26.840]  it was there let's leave it right there let's go ahead and go to him on Howard Stern and
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.000]  you're hearing about this here other folks obviously knew about this but no one's reported
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.160]  it now we're reporting at info wars dot com here he is defending the rape anally of a
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:41.040]  13-year-old girl here it is I mean dying to get a hold of you for this reason when you
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:47.080]  Gary Garver our reporter out in Hollywood interview here's what you said I got to ask you about

[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:13.720]  yeah that was pretty cool actually yeah what's so great about rape is being the recipient
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:19.920]  of Hollywood's highest honor I am I don't think I'm right that's the one that how could
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:26.640]  you defend so I don't understand this how come Hollywood embraces this madman as director
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:32.000]  who raped a 13-year-old he didn't rape the 13 years it was statutory rape yeah all right
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.600]  well that's not quite the same thing back it up 10 seconds Robin and Stern are absolutely
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:45.400]  right if you're 16 you got a 20-year-old boyfriend it's creepy but it's statutory if you're 18

[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:26.240]  violent throwing them down it's like one of the most violent crimes in the world you can't
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.440]  throw you know throwing the word rape around is like throwing the word racist around okay
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:34.320]  you know it just doesn't apply to everything that people use it for all right you know he
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.560]  was he was guilty of having sex with a minor all right she didn't want to have no that

[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:45.080]  all sad about it these are the same people she says in Kramer versus Kramer famous actor
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:48.920]  slapped her too hard she'd agreed it was part of the acting and she says she's traumatized

[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:16.040]  respiratory health and normal breathing this is pollen block. In the 1960s researchers
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:21.200]  in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:26.720]  less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:32.360]  production they began studying the effects in public trials in their public trials now
[01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:37.480]  we are introducing the fruit of the research a fast-acting chewable tablet just chew two

[01:32:54.040 --> 01:33:01.040]  triple eight two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:38.280]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones well he was on with us january
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:44.440]  19th that's about two weeks ago and i wasn't surprised this morning he doesn't easy contact
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.800]  us to come on we contact him to come on but a little bit of a triumphant return as he
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.120]  was predicting anytime the markets would have multi thousand point corrections we ought to
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.400]  dig that video up i forgot to tell the crew he was on the street last night and other
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.880]  tv channels breaking it down but he did add the point that i i agree with i mean it is
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:07.680]  the rake heights that are doing this and the federal reserve may secretly want to sink
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:15.200]  the record breaking stock market well that's definitely what dr. michael sabbage thinks
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.560]  that's what i said in july what i said in december we've already played those clips
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:26.240]  here so all i'm saying is can't america have its bubble too but as ship has said it'll
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.120]  just implode at one point or another question is are we here yet and why would they want
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:35.200]  to precipitate that we're going to him of euro pacific capital here in just a moment
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:43.200]  but briefly we're about to end a bunch of big specials at infowarstore.com we have the very
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:48.120]  best water filtration the very best air filtration we have a great trump pinch 2020 limited edition
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:54.560]  new shirt the others sold out only for one month and again a clear vision for the future
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.280]  it is a collector's shirt one run we also have pollen block it's totally natural that
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:05.160]  has the japanese quail fed a special diets proprietary and secret and then they don't
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:10.520]  know why but it absolutely really helps with the seasonal distress the pollen the things
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.280]  that obviously upset so many people out there when i forget to take it i really really notice
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:19.360]  here in austin texas known as the capital of allergies and i wanted to come out with
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:23.680]  something that even cost less but had more bio pqq and coq 10 and we made some bigger
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:28.440]  connections and some of the prices fell in the organically produced formulas and you
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:34.200]  can't call it organic it's organically produced by bacteria it's not the synthetic type but
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:39.720]  the point is is that it is the purest best form out there leading competitors 300 200
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.440]  bucks you name it it's usually a great deal at 100 it's called dna force well we now named
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:49.040]  it cell force to get around some contracts so that we could go even lower on the price
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.400]  but then when i negotiated with the folks they said go ahead and use dna forces that's

[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:15.560]  of this year predicted here on this broadcast that it was imminent a major stock market
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:20.440]  correction of multi thousand points no need to go play the clip many of you heard it for
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:24.680]  the time because we'll just go right to him i may get to it after he leaves us and just
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:30.080]  to tag it on so we post this later people can see that but the federal reserve may secretly
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.320]  want to sink the record breaking stock market that is a quote here and that's out of the
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:40.800]  street dot com he was on msnbc cnbc talking about it i don't know the fed has much love
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:45.360]  for trump he said adding that the fed had the markets back during the obama administration
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.840]  maybe the fed would be happy to see the bear market that could be blamed on trump shiv
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:56.040]  thinks the markets can easily correct 20 percent that's what he said two weeks ago show joining
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:01.000]  us right now is the man that predicted so why is this happening you know more since
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.160]  last night obviously what's really going on well as i've been saying and excuse my voice
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:15.280]  about a cat got a cold the other day but by interest rates have been rising right the
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:19.960]  yield on the long bond has been i gotta take a drink it's okay well you look great even
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:23.360]  if your voice is gone we don't know how it is this time of year i'll go down i just
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:27.160]  did an interview i don't have my voice i understand petership of euro pack dot com
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:33.600]  joins us but um so interest rates have been rising the markets have been ignoring this
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.960]  and i said look eventually the markets can't ignore it why are rates going up it's not
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:43.800]  the fed hiking rates it's bond prices falling why is that happening it's happening because
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:49.360]  the budget deficits and the trade deficits are skyrocketing we got a trade deficit today
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.600]  december deficit biggest in nine years if you take out oil the biggest trade deficit
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:59.000]  we've ever had in one month as a country i mean trade deficits are exploding and when
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.200]  the tax cuts were passed that shined a light on the massive deficits that are going to
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:10.400]  be needed to finance each these tax cuts plus trump is talking about infrastructure spending
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.320]  that money has to be borrowed they have a budget deal now they're doing they're going to include
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:18.760]  pork barrel spending for the democrats and the republicans they're throwing all physical
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:24.320]  discipline out the window we are about to flood the world with treasury bonds who is
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.840]  going to buy these bonds the fed is saying they're not going to buy any the fed is saying
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:32.840]  they're actually going to sell bonds that they're going to let their balance sheet shrink
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:37.320]  the last time we had a trillion dollar a year budget deficit the fed was doing 85 billion
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:42.520]  of qe a month now they're saying we're going to do the opposite of that so bonds are falling
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:46.240]  and that's going to bring down the the stock market it's going to bring down the economy
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:51.160]  because the only thing that's been propping us up has been very cheap money very low interest
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:56.800]  rates you take that away and everything comes toppling down you know the danger for trump
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:03.720]  is it happens while he's on the job peter chef it looks like what you're saying here
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.760]  with a great track record of predicting things accurately and raising billions for your investors
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.720]  that there's two things trump is massively pumping money into the world economy and attempt
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:17.840]  to turn things back on but at the same so that you can say is a problem historically
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.880]  but then also the federal reserve is now changing policies where they put up with this under
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:26.080]  obama but they've signaled oh we're not going to buy any of our treasuries like we did with
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.920]  obama and we're going to raise interest rates leaving trump out in the cold a true double
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:37.920]  cross well it's not that this will be positive what the federal reserve did under obama was
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.240]  not good for the country we would have been much better off had we done no no i understand
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:46.240]  that but they're changing their policy for trump as you said well let me ask it this
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.800]  way i mean repeating and expanding on what you said last night on the street and what
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:55.000]  you said on cnbc about the federal reserve having an offer the president please give
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.120]  us your take on that well when i made those comments and they were a while back actually
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:07.240]  i said that i believed that had hillary clinton won well jada yellen was fed chairman i don't
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:11.740]  believe we would have got all those rate hikes i think the fed would have been much more cautious
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:17.720]  about raising rates when if hillary had won but since trump had won i think they went
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:22.600]  forward with those rate hikes even though the economic data didn't support it in fact despite
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.560]  what everybody's talking about if you look at the data right gdp growth last year was
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:31.480]  not strong in fact it's probably going to come out weaker than the average that we had
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:37.080]  in obama's second term job growth last in the last year is the slowest it's been in
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:43.080]  since 2010 we don't really have a strong economy but we have a lot of debt and and and so now
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:48.400]  that pal is coming in i mean pal pal has been appointed by trump we'll see if he is going
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:53.680]  to give in to some political pressure which ultimately is not good for the country to just
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:42:00.040]  print money to try to paper this over is not a good thing but i think if the fed has to
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.880]  rescue the markets and rescue the economy with another round of quantitative easing and
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:09.640]  obviously too it's going to embarrass trump if the fed has to reverse course because the
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.880]  economy is a mess and the stock market is tanking now that he's already cranked claim
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:18.920]  credit for it but if the fed does that again it is not going to end well i think it's going
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.920]  to cause a dollar crisis i think it's going to cause a sovereign debt crisis i don't think
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:28.320]  the fed can do for trump what it did for obama i think they're out of bullets i think the
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:34.240]  next time they do qe it's going to be a fatal overdose okay stay there please let's walk
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:39.400]  through this on the other side of the head of europe pacific capital dot com on the other
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.400]  side and look at the bad side of all this if if he's corrected so far two weeks ago

[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:18.320]  sexism but another contributing factor was the outgrowth of all the anxiety and insecurity

[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:33.200]  live you know here's my thinking i know they propped up the stock market and gave the
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:39.040]  elites all this free interest money and did all this for eight years they plunged the
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:44.160]  market you know right whenever the election was happening to get obama in 2008 ship and
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:48.960]  predicted all that and then i'm just wanting america to have a chance i know china's got
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:54.600]  big bubbles europe has bubbles and i get what ships fundamentally saying is accurate all
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:59.200]  i'm saying is what is the alternative well we're going to talk about that some of them
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:02.640]  in a moment and and and he's right he said this back in september but they were rearing
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:07.720]  it last night drudge had it up so i was taking it as if he said about last night he was predicting
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:14.560]  it back on september 19th so let's go ahead and play a clip from that interview that's
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.840]  up on info wars dot com the full nine minute interview here's about a minute and a half
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.560]  and then we'll actually go to mr. shift to break down what happened yesterday what's
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.960]  happening now what he sees about to happen here it is the fed wouldn't let the market
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:32.960]  go down when obama was president they certainly didn't want it to go down before the election
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:38.440]  because they wanted to put hillary clinton into the oval office after obama so they had
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:43.800]  the markets back there was this put but what if the put expired with donald trump i don't
[01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:48.640]  know if the fed has much love for trump and now the trump has put his brand on the stock
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:54.640]  market and this economy maybe the fed is happy to allow a bear market well that can be blamed
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:59.400]  on trump you're calling the fed political which is certainly a valid argument a lot
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:05.680]  of people are saying that but the fed also had a recession in 2009 to deal with so they
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:11.020]  needed those stimulative measures then to deal with that well i have no doubt that they
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:16.280]  will come back with the same stimulus once this recession is fully underway and blamed
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:21.520]  on on president trump even though it's not his fault it's simply the mess that he inherited
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:27.640]  from obama but the fed did not have to do the type of economic stimulus that it did
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:33.600]  in 2009 2010 that's why the economy never healed that's why we're in worse trouble today
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.960]  than we were back then and remember the federal reserve created the housing bubble they're
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:43.560]  the reason we had a financial crisis it was their economic policy that began early in
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:48.720]  the bush era you know when we burst the dot all right now let's go to mr. schiff himself
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:53.640]  of that again is from a late last year but it sounds like you've showered some to trump
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:58.160]  you're saying he's kind of jumped on the bandwagon here and then he's basically repeating what
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:02.240]  happened before but the federal reserve it looks like it's ready to abandon him unlike
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:08.880]  obama well you know first of all just recently i was talking about us an 87 style stock market
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:14.880]  crash i my own podcast on friday i said well black money monday come early this year because
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:20.600]  i was comparing this year to 1987 because what happened in 87 is we had soaring trade
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:25.160]  deficit and budget deficits that were pushing down the dollar and up interest rates and
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:30.320]  that led to the stock market crash so more recently i've been i've been worried about
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:34.640]  a big drop in you called it two weeks ago here to interrupt you you said a black monday
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:40.240]  two weeks ago but in answer to your question i mean what can trump do rather than blow
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.080]  a bigger bubble we can have real economic growth he can make america great again we can have
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:50.840]  real prosperity that is possible but first we have to clean up the mess the problem is
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:56.000]  trump is trying to make the mess look like legitimate a recovery when he was a candidate
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.680]  he was dead on accurate when he said the unemployment numbers were a myth they were a hoax well
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:06.160]  now he's perpetrating the same hoax he was dead on accurate when he said the stock market
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:11.880]  was a bubble it's still a bubble it's a bigger bubble so why can't trump the president govern
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:16.280]  like trump the candidate i want america to be great but in order to do that we can't
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:21.320]  blow another phony economy with a bubble we need real economic growth and so we need
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:26.680]  smaller government yes i want tax cuts but that means we need a smaller government that
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.640]  means we gotta cut spending we gotta eliminate departments we gotta make government smaller
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.760]  trump is making government bigger and he's cutting taxes and trying to claim credit
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:41.320]  you don't get credit for running bigger deficits to pay for bigger governments if you want prosperity
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:46.320]  we need to shrink government we need to unleash the free market we need to unleash capitalism
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:51.480]  we're not doing that we're doing the same smoke and mirror nonsense what trump doesn't
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:56.520]  realize is it isn't gonna work now he's not gonna get out of dodge he's gonna be a one
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:03.080]  term or with this and he's gonna he's gonna pave a way for a socialist in 2021 with both
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:10.320]  houses of congress they're gonna blame all of this on capitalism on the tax cuts on deregulation
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.000]  this is not what's causing it but it's gonna be what's gonna get the blame so trump should
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.360]  be doing the real things that need to be done if he's gonna get blamed for something let's
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:23.960]  get blamed for doing the right thing because doing the right thing means some short term
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:28.840]  pain but you know what we gotta suck it up you know no pain no gain there's a lot to
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:34.840]  be gained if we take constructive pain if we let this phony economy you know implode
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:39.840]  so we can replace it with something lasting and something real and i have confidence in
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:44.760]  the free market system and americans that the government got out of the way we could rebuild
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:51.000]  this country and that's what people elected trump to do not to blow an even bigger bubble
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.360]  but if if the economy would have imploded during a correction and then obviously come
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:59.240]  back stronger after as historically it does they would have been able to impeach him by
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:04.200]  now when he's trying to bring the republic back kill political correctness culturally
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:08.000]  he's doing a lot of things that are more important to me than even money but i understand what
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.920]  you're saying getting just in the technicals then what do you expect to happen now you've
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:17.720]  been pretty accurate well look you know i think the stock market is going to be trending
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:22.520]  lower because i think bond prices are going to keep falling and eventually bond prices
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:26.960]  are going to crash and interest rates are going to skyrocket the only thing that will
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:33.040]  prevent bond prices from crashing is if the stock market crashes first and the fed comes
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:37.760]  to the rescue of the market by admitting that it's not going to keep raising rates that
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:42.080]  it's not going to shrink its balance sheet that that it's going to launch qe for i think
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.760]  the fed has to sacrifice the dollar to prop everything up and they may do that there's
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:52.320]  going to be a lot of political pressure on the fed to do just that but that is a mistake
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:57.280]  because that is going to kill the dollar that is going to create a crisis and ultimately
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:02.840]  a currency crisis and what that implies for the u.s economy the average american is going
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:09.760]  to be much more disruptive than a repeat financial crisis but i think all that can happen before
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:15.760]  trump finishes this term so either way it's going to be a disaster and it's not going
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:20.680]  to be a record that he can run on four more years the democrats are going to exploit this
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:25.480]  to blame it on the republicans to blame it on trump to say you see what happens when
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:29.480]  you cut taxes you see what happens when you cut regulations even though we haven't really
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:33.600]  cut that many and even though the tax cuts don't count because we didn't cut government
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:38.960]  spending we just substituted debt for taxation which is a bad trade putting government on
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:44.480]  a credit card is a more expensive way to pay for it but all this is going to bite us just
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:50.800]  like obama obama became president because everybody blamed the financial crisis on bush
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:56.940]  and on capitalism and on deregulation that's not why but bush stood idly by while this
[01:54:56.940 --> 01:55:01.760]  bubble inflated around him and you had all these republican talking heads who were cheerleading
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:07.240]  this phony economy and i was on cnbc and i was unseen in fox saying you guys are making
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:11.680]  a mistake by singing the praise of this bubble because when it blows up it's going to come
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:15.960]  back to bite us that's exactly what i'm going to ask you this question they don't let me
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:21.920]  on cnbc anymore so i can't point this out i'm not disagreeing with you on the fundamentals
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:27.200]  here all i'm saying is look at the dollar at least last time i checked an hour ago was
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:33.240]  up on all this certainty aren't we kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood the dollar
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:39.160]  is barely up you know when the when the market was crashing back in 2008 the dollar was soaring
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:44.520]  the dollar index is still below 90 the dollar has barely recovered anything so there isn't
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.280]  a flight to the dollar all that's happened over the last couple of days is the dollar
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:53.480]  stopped falling but you know the dollar should be falling if people really understand what's
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:59.280]  going on but they don't that the markets will keep falling until the fed cries uncle until
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.720]  the fed you know takes away the rate hikes and of course that's what's been propping
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:08.160]  the dollar up and the amazing thing is the dollar has been falling even though everybody
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:12.360]  expects rate hikes even though everybody thinks the economy is good even though everybody
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:16.280]  thinks the fed is going to shrink the money supply the dollar has still been sinking the
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:20.560]  dollar has everything going for let's talk let's talk timetables and when you sit around
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:24.720]  the table with your wife and children or your business partners what do you really expect
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:30.240]  to happen in the economy look you know i expect the economy to relapse back into recession
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:35.120]  i believe we would have already been in a recession if you look at how gdp slowed rapidly
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:41.000]  obama's last year of growth was very low i think in hillary one we would have been in
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.480]  a recession in the first year now the fed might not have raised rates as many times
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.840]  as they did but i think we would have we're going there anyway but because trump won and
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:58.080]  the prospect of it being a game changer it created a lot of excitement and i think there
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.720]  was some spending that took place or maybe some investment that might not otherwise
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:08.360]  have taken place and so i think we bought some time i think the onset i agree with you
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:12.320]  so let me ask this is about a break let me ask you this petership of euro pack dot com

[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:28.160]  of Europe Pacific capital euro pack dot com then i'm gonna open the phones up into all
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:33.320]  the other big breaking news in the next segment but i like the fact that trumps anti-political
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:38.360]  correctness says he's free market doing a lot of good things but it's true that this
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:42.720]  economy is a giant bubble and now again as i said before the break we see the federal
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:48.200]  reserve with the activities it's doing not supporting president trump like it did obama
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:54.960]  so we're just asking mr shift why he thinks that's happening and then what that will precipitate
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:00.080]  well you know the fed i said they were dragging their feet in raising rates while obama was
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.960]  president they talked about raising rates but at the end of the day they barely moved
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:10.000]  them up now the the pace of hikes has increased since trump was elected but part of the reason
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.280]  for that i mean the media is not talking down the economy if anything they're they're over
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:19.600]  hyping the guy everybody's talking about how strong the economy is how everything is great
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.760]  everybody is taking credit for this great economy the fed wants to take credit for it
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.880]  trump wants to take credit for it so if everybody's talking about how great the economy is the
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.160]  fed doesn't have any excuse if it doesn't raise rates how can the fed not raise rates
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:37.120]  when they're so low if the economy is really this great so in order to keep up the pretense
[02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:41.320]  that the economy is as strong as everybody thinks the fed is in this box where it has
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:45.920]  to raise rates but you know they can't tell the truth that well it's really a bubble and
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:50.200]  if we raise rates we're going to prick it so they're kind of in this bind and they and
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:54.560]  they're still you know calligraphy that they're going to raise rates three or four times this
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:59.320]  year and and that is the problem you know and and the market though is moving rates
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:04.160]  up even higher because the deficit is exploding you see one of the things that happened under
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:12.840]  Obama is he inherited a massive deficit from from Bush to deficit skyrocketed in 2008 2009
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:18.840]  and so you know after a couple years the deficits were slowly falling while Obama was present
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:22.840]  now they were falling from a very high level but at least they were going down all of a
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:27.560]  sudden deficits are skyrocketing and they're about to explode out of control yet we have
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:32.480]  no way to finance them that is the problem and so interest rates have no place to go
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:37.800]  up but way up not just a little up but but much much higher and how can we afford to
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:44.760]  service the debt where is the government going to get the money to pay the if you're right
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:48.360]  get out of this is there a way to get out of this because culturally what he's doing
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:53.960]  is great no well look the sooner he tells the truth the better but of course you know
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:59.040]  it's going to be hard now given all the credit he's claimed for what's happened since he
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:03.360]  was elected for him to now come clean and say the economy is no good you know the stock
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:09.880]  markets a bubble you know he is so he I think he got a lot of bad advice and now unfortunately
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:15.800]  he's he is the fall guy there's no way to stop this and if the Fed under Powell tries
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:20.440]  to buy Trump some time I don't think he's going to buy enough I think the problem is
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:25.000]  so big that the minute the Fed has to try to solve it it's going to unleash a much
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.600]  bigger one but in fairness you did call this two weeks ago you said it was imminent but
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:35.280]  you've been you've been thinking this is going to implode before though well I didn't think
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:40.720]  the stock market would because I thought the Fed would would cave I have expected the Fed
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:46.200]  to basically backtrack I thought the Fed was was you know was more bluffing and you know
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:49.640]  they haven't shrunk the balance sheet so I'm right there they've been talking about it
[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:54.400]  it hasn't actually happened but they've have raised interest rates several times they're
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:04:00.120]  still posturing as if they're going to keep doing it and when I saw the big increase in
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:07.160]  long-term interest rates based on is a skyrocketing budget deficit and a skyrocketing trade deficit
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:12.440]  I was like okay this is it the markets got a tank how could the market go up for so many
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:17.920]  days and ignore all this bad news I mean when you see these big increases in interest rates
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:25.400]  when you see these deficits you know that this is a problem and then go down the next
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:30.640]  month or so or just keep kind of going down well right now I think we've done a lot of
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.160]  technical damage I don't think this market is going to roar back and make new highs unless
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:40.320]  the Fed engineers it but if the Fed is going to continue to posture as if rates are going
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:44.480]  up and they're going to shrink their balance sheet then they're going to sell the stock
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:48.360]  market and more importantly they're going to sell the pot I know you got to go we're back
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:52.120]  in 60 seconds let me ask you one question how low do you think it will go then and then
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:57.480]  how do we come back out of that in what you're saying is true back in 60 Frank in North Carolina

[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:29.160]  it's imminent we could have you know one of these collapses on Monday coming up the next
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:35.720]  few weeks of course he said that a few weeks ago on his own show so I get he's a smart
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:40.840]  guy been interviewing him probably I don't know at least 15 years or so and he's a respected
[02:06:40.840 --> 02:06:43.680]  guy but he said a lot of things they didn't want to hear so he's kind of been banned
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:50.160]  off MSNBC and CNBC and you know other channels I guess he's on Fox Business some but he's
[02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:55.200]  here and here's where I stand and then I want to be able to finish up and get out here
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:59.280]  because I know he's busy Trump culturally going after political correctness trying to
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:05.280]  secure our border trying to not attack our families take care of our veterans the exuberance
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:11.360]  the positivity I like that I get there's issues damn to be brings the economy down to reset
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:16.040]  it damned if he doesn't it's a bubble they blame it on him so it's kind of like I'm
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:21.440]  a backseat driver we all are other than our own positivity our own exuberance but I'm
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:25.880]  not in a cult at the same time I just think what would it be like if Hillary was in they
[02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:30.160]  were coming after the free press they already are they I mean we've been a much worse world
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:35.840]  so I just don't want to be the eternal pessimist here but I've been sitting there every day
[02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:39.400]  just waiting to wake up and see the stock market drop a couple thousand points and then
[02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:43.480]  precipitated downward spiral so we just joined us during the last segment he was getting
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:46.720]  into is the Fed really going to raise rates then it was going to start going down if they
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:53.320]  don't how long can that go so just finishing up then on what you expect depending on what
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:59.680]  the Fed does this to look like and some of the time frames there it's not just the Fed
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:04.760]  raising short term rates it is the market raising long term rates the yield on a ten
[02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:10.680]  year treasury is about three percent right just under three percent historically the
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:16.960]  yield averages the nominal GDP which is you know the real GDP plus the inflation rate
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:22.040]  so if you look at where GDP is now in inflation the yield should be seven percent why is it
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:26.520]  three percent we can't afford seven percent if everything is so great why are interest
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:30.960]  rates still so low I mean none of it makes sense I mean they're old they're low but they
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:36.240]  can't stay here so the market is now getting a sense of this massive supply of treasury
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:41.120]  bonds that is going to be flooding the market why would you want to own these bonds China
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:44.440]  doesn't want to own them Japan doesn't want to own them Americans don't have any money
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:49.120]  to buy them we have the lowest savings rate in over ten years nobody wants these treasuries
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:52.880]  and not only does the treasury have to sell them the Fed says they're going to sell theirs
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:57.320]  so there are no real buyers yields have to go up and so everything has to come crashing
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:03.080]  down these social issues need to take a backseat if the economy crashes if the market crashes
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:08.560]  if we have a worse economy than the one that Bush left Obama then none of the other stuff
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.720]  matters because we're simply paving the way for somebody worse than Hillary Clinton not
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:18.720]  worse than that you know I mean Bernie Sanders I think is an honest man he's just completely
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:24.160]  wrong he's he just he's just a naive socialist who doesn't know anything Hillary was just
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:29.880]  about making money for herself but I don't want socialists taken over Washington I don't
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:35.800]  want a wave of discontent right so that Sanders or somebody like him can surf into the White
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:41.360]  House I don't want to see all these Republicans lose first in 2018 and then in 2020 because
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:45.720]  if you're worried about these other issues what do you think is going to happen when
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:51.320]  the Democrats have a cow everything and not just regular Democrats people way to the left
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:55.720]  of any any Democrat who's ever been in office because this is going to put such a black
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:01.040]  eye on capitalism on cutting they're going to say we need more government we need more
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:06.600]  regulation look at how badly business screwed up the economy we cut taxes on business and
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:12.160]  look at the mess right oh Obama Obama handed a perfect economy let me bring that up Trump
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:15.960]  is trying to unify the country the left is trying to cause a civil war it's in the wiki
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:24.360]  leagues so do they get any blame if they're able to take all this I don't look I think
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:27.640]  they're Trump's going to get blame because he's already claimed credit for how great
[02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:32.360]  everything is he said because of media commies booming but don't you get he's trying to cheer
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:37.000]  lead to prop it up and get actual jobs back you know that but that's not that's not going
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:42.440]  to get actual jobs back and it's not getting actual jobs back what we need for actual jobs
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:47.280]  is we need more savings we need more capital investment we need to grow worker productivity
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:50.680]  none of this is happening because we've got a gigantic government in the way and we've
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:56.040]  got too much debt so what does your gut tell you do you think the Fed backs off and then
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:02.520]  bats crump or do you think that they go ahead and start raising interest rates look I think
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:07.840]  that eventually if the economic data gives them cover if the market goes down enough
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:14.240]  they will be political for Trump the way they were political for Clinton I mean now that
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:18.720]  Powell is there Powell is a Republican Powell is not Janet Yellen I didn't think Janet Yellen
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:23.920]  wanted to help Trump and but maybe Powell will I mean that might be why Trump appointed
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:27.480]  him but I don't think it's going to help I think it's going to be too little too late
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:32.960]  I think the economy is too bad the bubble is too big there's too much air that another
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:38.000]  round of quantitative easing cutting interest rates from one and a half percent to zero
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.400]  is not going to do it there are no more bubbles to inflate we have the biggest bubble now
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:46.600]  we have the mother of all bubbles and the air is going to come out of it and I don't
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:51.240]  think Trump can get out of dodge in time and this is the danger this is the political
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:57.320]  danger of where we are and why I really wish that he had come in more forthright about
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:03.240]  the problems not that he caused them but that he's going to clean up the mess now people
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:06.680]  are going to claim that it's Trump's mess that needs to be clean but see his great strength
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:13.680]  is the optimism you can also call it his Achilles heel will be watching it together again it's
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:18.120]  false optimism I don't want to be optimistic that you know the ISIS sound and then I go
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:23.680]  on and I fall through right you need to only be optimistic when it's warranted this false
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:29.040]  optimism you know you you promise a lot and you deliver very little you have so many people
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:32.960]  that expect so much and they're going to be so disappointed this is not going to go over
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:40.680]  well and so a better approach would it would have been you know a more honest explanation
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:45.080]  of the problem and even if that meant one term it would have been one term that was
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.400]  worth it it would have been one term we could do something good as opposed to just be a
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:53.640]  stepping stone right to something much worse well Peter ship your smart guy would have
[02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:59.200]  been a good one thank you so much for the time I don't happen to my backdrop hey I like
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:04.000]  it I kind of like you know we've had our TV we've had our TV show before and it looks
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:07.600]  and it's a sharp it looks even cooler when it's black back there hey thanks for joining
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:15.520]  us yeah alright there he goes everything is perspective and I agree with the fundamentals
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:19.120]  of what Peter shifts just said so we have him on he's proven very accurate over the
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.720]  years sometimes predicting things before they happen but then they end up happening you
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:30.440]  look at nationalism whether it's Brexit or whether it's what's happening in South America
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:37.080]  or what's happening all over Europe or what's happening here this is about nationalism and
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:41.920]  about taking our country's back and about taking our sovereignty back and about taking
[02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:52.400]  our culture back and taking us out of the TPP look at the psychology of that photo of
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:58.600]  two old folks by themselves in a big stadium of your radio listener it's an article trying
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:03.560]  to make it look like oh why is nationalism so popular but then the message is it's old
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:11.600]  it's over it's gone and nobody is in the bleachers with you sometimes a picture is worth a thousand
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:15.800]  words a thousand words of deception that was an old couple that showed up hours before
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:23.480]  Trump showed up to be at the rally and they got in first and the photographer was there
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:30.080]  waiting for it but again another deception so there are a lot of things worth more than
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:35.480]  money and I'll say this we're sitting on top of time bomb like I said yesterday you're
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:41.400]  in the show before the plunging was started but it's our time bomb and we're taking control
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:45.920]  of the system away they've had the bubble in China five depending on the year ten times
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:51.360]  bigger than ours it's totally state run and pumped up and quite frankly if they deflate
[02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:55.280]  it now the country will descend into civil war and mass death they already have thousands
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:01.160]  of riots a week in China like I said dead bodies riding on the side of the road it's
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:04.160]  easy for it to leverage its power up because it gives nothing to its people they have no
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:09.880]  standard of living they produce a ton and then get nothing and I've got a stack of articles
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:13.640]  about you know Americans have to learn to have less and all the rest of it well only
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:17.560]  if the establishment really proves that and then they themselves give up something but
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.000]  instead they just get richer and richer and more and more powerful it's an argument for
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:27.280]  feudalism is always oh we're saving Mother Earth going back to Plato two thousand three
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:34.880]  hundred and sixty two years ago you know writing Plato's Republican memory serves so again culturally
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:40.400]  Trump's delivering spiritually he's delivering energy wise he's delivering is he stuck in
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:45.040]  a rock in a hard place absolutely but can that incredible optimism blast our way out
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:49.680]  absolutely and are they plunged in the market right now controlled to send him a message

[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:43.400]  now that this is one of the most important things I've probably ever said in my long
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:55.680]  history of being on air and it's this there are different types of wealth there is physical
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:21:09.000]  monetary wealth there is genetic wealth health there is creativity there are so many different
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:18.680]  types of wealth time itself is wealth and the media sets everything up that the stock
[02:21:18.680 --> 02:21:23.320]  market is the measure of everything or how big a piece of property you have is the measure
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:28.200]  of who you are or how big your red carpet is or do you have the biggest house on the
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:34.240]  hill the best neighborhood in the best elite area and then once they get you that artificial
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:41.160]  system they can get you to sell out your principles and your very humanity for these symbols of
[02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:48.000]  power that aren't real wealth and I say that because I like seeing our stock market up
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:54.880]  I like seeing record low jobless claims I like seeing record new small company startups
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:22:00.240]  I like seeing optimism when the globalists have been trying to demoralize the average
[02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:08.120]  person demoralize small companies demoralize farmers demoralize ranchers demoralize small
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:15.880]  independent groups of people the world has been in hundreds of years of vertical integration
[02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:22.240]  we were in total vertical integration 550 years ago before a few hundred years of Renaissance
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:28.880]  began an explosion of freedom but still limited the robber barons the last 200 years struck
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:35.360]  back they lost some places like 1776 but we just became what we were fighting within
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:41.880]  a hundred years look at the jungle look at look at the tomes that were written at that
[02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:50.560]  time of what was happening so we positively point out that exuberance bringing jobs back
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:57.600]  bringing factories back bringing back pro-human economies is a good thing but then the media
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:03.440]  says you didn't really cause that prosperity or that prosperity isn't really real they
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:08.920]  talk on both sides of their mouth Obama you didn't build that business Obama did Trump
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:14.320]  points out removing some regulations cutting some energy prices has caused a surge but
[02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:18.640]  we were supposed to be going into austerity by now that's what it openly been said at
[02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:23.600]  all the universities the big think tanks what Obama gave speeches about in Argentina and
[02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:32.520]  Brazil and Nigeria and South Africa and Thailand and you name it you can't have a car you can't
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:37.400]  have air conditioning that that's going to make the earth boil over but I can I'm the
[02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:46.560]  feudal class I'm the overlord class that controls the feudalists that controls the slaves so
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:52.000]  take Russia this is a boil down just stalls of a historical research I've done you know
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:58.560]  that fades with a mist of memory but you get the Soviet Union a enclave of leftist expansion
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:03.800]  the public uses total brainwash slaves to build a technological system to challenge
[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:08.520]  the West and expand but also make the West expand to face that threat becoming what it
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:13.480]  claimed it was fighting so a very sophisticated Machiavellian gambit that was very successful
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:18.000]  and they've declassified the fact that that was the case people like McCarthy came along
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:23.800]  and exposed our own Carnegie Foundation and the army are running the Soviet Union and
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:28.560]  advising him and our economists tell them what to do he was out of there at that point
[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:32.000]  when he was just wanting to spy on people and get rid of the Bill of Rights he was a
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:37.200]  wonderful guy but as soon as he broke through to the real level of what was going on he
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:41.840]  was bye bye and now it's all declassified the Russians know it's all come out and they're
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:47.400]  pretty pissed off so again as an example of where we should go we look at countries like
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:54.600]  Russia you go back to 1991-92 they had seven or eight big oligarchs all owned by western
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:59.840]  banks the people were kept artificially poor there wasn't supposed to be an economy in
[02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:08.040]  Russia Russia was purely extraction at point blank range no economy starvation level the
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:12.680]  state run institutions collapsing used up they thought they'd come in a final phase with
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:19.920]  oligarchs and cut it up even more and bring in Western colonialism in the end phase after
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:25.240]  communism that only took 30 years in China it took 80 plus until the globalist thought
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:31.800]  Russia was ready for full absorption or the asinguation the bloodsucking but Russia came
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:36.640]  back kicked that out seized control of the means of production began transferring it
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.880]  to the people and institutions loyal to the population in a nationalist populist blood
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:48.840]  and soil program from that launch point the globalist was still arrogant moving on but
[02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:52.920]  that same instinct that same human instinct the sleeping giant only coming back at the
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:26:00.760]  point of cultural death began to launch all over the world and so Trump's great triumph
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:09.480]  is cultural victory pro-human victory pro-western values victory both crushing the back of free
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:16.200]  speech controllers going after the censors and making us be a nation again and if they
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:21.840]  try to sabotage our economy and try to shut us down as sanctions and internal espionage
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:29.400]  and attacks did in Russia in the last 17 18 years the Russians dug in and have built an
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:35.440]  even better homogeneous economy which is a good thing that is independent and not under
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:41.880]  outside control and burgeoning technology and so many other systems and finally turning
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:47.600]  their population reduction program back from the break of death and showing meager games
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:53.760]  we can do that in space and so that's what I'm telling you they hijacked the stock market
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:58.720]  and plunge it they try to block new jobs coming in they do all this no Trump came in in the
[02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:05.120]  midst of our final beheading bringing us down like Russia had been and reversed it and now
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:10.360]  he's fighting with this whole structure as you are and as I am and the system thinks you're
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:18.640]  so shallow that if they can implode the economy if they can bloody the nose of this victory
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:24.320]  you'll somehow like a bunch of sharks roll over and turn on someone who believed in you
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:28.920]  and is making hundreds of phone calls a day and traveling the country trying to supercharge
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:35.760]  the nation and who's made the decision to fight their bubbles with a bubble based on you and
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:38.960]  the globalists have taken record profits off the exuberance because they were already going
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:42.280]  to get it all to begin with they don't like that because they know a lot of that money
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:49.000]  is going to you but it's bigger than that the victory is cultural they could bring us
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.800]  into a depression that's why we got to be independent and prepared they could do anything
[02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:57.120]  to us to break our will and make us accept the nightmare of disarmament the nightmare
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:01.960]  of cultural brainwashing the nightmare of the race war division they're sowing and we
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:08.600]  know the number one mission is to spiritually and culturally and physically not be under
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:14.520]  the globalist system because a hundred years after the big new york banks financed the
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:19.600]  bolshevik revolution they believe and sorrows believed that last year would be their victory
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:26.600]  with hair hillary and it fell on its face so money is a secondary issue they want to
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:31.600]  make it the issue of making you so poor you've got to have it trump wants to make you be comfortable
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:35.720]  so you can do the higher things but know this if they think they're going to try to take
[02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:41.320]  the monetary away from us like a dog holding on to a bone we have to understand it's the
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:46.640]  long fight and as bad as things may get they'd be a lot worse and according to the enemy's
[02:28:46.640 --> 02:28:57.840]  terms if we had stood up for the entire long committed fight hear that that's the sound
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:04.000]  of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place and what they don't steal

[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:50.560]  segment that i'm saying some of the most important things i've ever said and i guarantee you almost
[02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:54.680]  everybody listens said buddy that's everything my grandma and grandpa said everything my preacher
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:59.960]  said everything i think about it tonight don't tell us something we don't already know it's
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:08.400]  it's it's the greatest truths that are hiding right in front of us the greatest truths are
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:13.000]  the average person just wants enough money to be comfortable take care of their family
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:18.320]  have decent transportation and maybe see a couple cool places a year there is a wanderlust
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:22.440]  one of the things i like having some money is that i can go see things but then i'm always
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:26.640]  so busy fighting the globalist i don't so sometimes i do a kind of work case if i need
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:30.320]  to go cover something then you know every once in a while i'll take the family but that's
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:36.240]  like once a year now and i'm not ashamed of that fact i mean i'm proud of the fact that
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:42.400]  in my hierarchy of needs it's not walking down red carpets in fact that wasn't something
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:50.120]  i really wanted 20 years ago but i still thought it was kind of interesting now it's not even
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:57.120]  on my pyramid remember in health class they had the hierarchy of needs what was it called
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:04.760]  maslos or something but it had like shelter and foods at the bottom and then you want
[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:09.000]  to have friendship and community and then you want to have organizational systems to
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  take care of others and then you really become purely charity driven and that is how a good
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:19.440]  person is because when you really become successful then as maslos i was going from
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:24.560]  from memory 30 years ago that was like in freshman and high school or something i'll
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:32.680]  be 44 next week self-actualization esteem love belonging safety psychology they gotta
[02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:39.160]  have your basic psychology and then be operating not as an insane person so sanity we'll see
[02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:43.720]  how my memory does from 30 something years ago let's go back so you've got about 31 years
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:49.120]  ago i read this in the textbook and but it made sense to me so sanity is the number one
[02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:54.360]  thing you need in life then it's it's it's yeah yeah physiological your body i mean i
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:57.760]  know it's physiological but i'm saying psychology you gotta have your body gotta have your health
[02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:01.720]  gotta have food gotta have your psychology you gotta have i'm kind of combining a bunch
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:05.640]  of things there they were pointing out a typo i was kind of combining it all together so
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:10.400]  you gotta have your food gotta have your water gotta have your shelter gotta have your your
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:17.000]  mind and not be insane and then safety you're not insane you've got a decent village you're
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:20.960]  good people got enough fish to catch everybody's doing great you're taking care of grandma and
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:26.720]  grandfather taking care of you because they don't want plants to take when you're sick
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:30.240]  and then safety because you don't want a bunch of folks coming over the next hill and enslaving
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:35.320]  you because they might be bad folks and then there's love and belonging feeling like you
[02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:41.640]  have kinship and then there is a steam the fact that you're proud of the fact that's
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:46.960]  what's happening and other people are proud of you and you've had success in the community
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:54.560]  you've mastered some things and then finally self-actualization but self-actualization
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:01.200]  is very empowering but it's also like having a much taken away from me because let me tell
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:06.520]  you something i used to enjoy even 15 years ago being famous and being able to affect
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:14.280]  things and rubbing it into enemies and defeating people that were bad as you get more conscious
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:19.320]  like rocket boosters on the space shuttle falling off you kind of miss it because that
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:25.760]  engine of ego and and the raw lust for power even though i was a moral person and a good
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:29.960]  person and didn't like pedophiles and didn't like globalists and didn't like artists still
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:35.480]  it was about i'm big i'm bad i'm strong and i'm going to beat all of you i've still got
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:42.640]  that skeleton but then it becomes self-actualization then if we can't defeat these bad people we're
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:47.520]  going to lose the whole species and i really am everybody else that's around me and it's
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:56.180]  complete collectivism but you don't do collectivism at the bottom that creates nightmares of hell
[02:37:56.180 --> 02:38:04.480]  collectivism is individually deployed by individuals that have become self-actualized
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:10.000]  to the larger global system of interconnectedness but it doesn't mean you give up your individualism
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:14.320]  for some greater good that always becomes a tyranny it means you balance all of that
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:20.240]  and gauge the good of the whole knowing you're part of a large continuum or compendium that's
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:30.840]  always expanding let's see there are other people who aren't born in my view as genetic
[02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:38.520]  psychopaths or born as genetic sociopaths but are artificially brought into it seeking
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:44.840]  power seeking shelter seeking safety they never go above the second level and in seeking
[02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:49.840]  safety they enter into deals with the devil and with the system believing that will empower
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:56.680]  them and become models of the psychopathic barbarous aggressive murderous systems that
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:03.000]  they've seen that they believe are successful and they're able to then organize all of that
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:10.880]  and deploy all of that synthetically it's been said that peace is an artificial construct
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:17.840]  and is only us denying our real selves no peace is us accepting our real selves but
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:24.920]  also understanding peace has many definitions and means basically the absence of open war
[02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:30.720]  and barbarism so we create law we create systems of violence that are not physically violent
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:41.120]  but then there are super classes above that that act in true violence but covert violence
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:47.600]  through culture chemical biological radiological to wage war against the entire population
[02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:59.320]  in a self actualization of pure satanism where you say I am not as I become self actualized
[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:03.840]  someone connected everybody else I hate them I hate how they look I hate how they sound
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:09.240]  I hate the fact that they're there contending their wills with me and so I want to dumb
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:16.720]  them down and then kill them and that is a self actualization of the globalist and they
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:20.800]  think those of us that are self actualized that don't want to go with that plan are fools
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:24.880]  but then I take one look at these so-called elitist and they're not elitist you know the
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:30.160]  crew put up a London independent article that says mal killed 45 million people well there's
[02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:38.040]  the cultural revolution the great leap forward a bunch of the stuff but the CIA says 65 million
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:46.720]  and the Communist Chinese Party says 84 million and they say that mistakes were made so I
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:52.080]  don't know what the real number is but 45 million is a low number 65 is a moderate number
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:57.320]  94 million in the 20th century that's reason with an article it's much higher than that
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:02.560]  do you think about that that's something you want to be running from but see the average
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:10.480]  dumb down trendy who feels disempowered who can't even get the basic psychology the basic
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:16.920]  physiology the basic working body which above all you need a working mind that's why I see
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:21.920]  physiology I think psychology I think your mental capacity automatically my brain just
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:27.680]  sees that word and you think about what they've done you think about what's unfolded and you
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:33.800]  think about what they've turned us into and it's just incredible it's the quest to get
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:39.400]  out of the way of fellow humans and build them up so you have a future with other humans
[02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:45.440]  because you realize your great-great-grandchildren are you and there's a love of this great continuum
[02:41:45.440 --> 02:41:50.920]  of knowledge and energy and soul that will then manifest in the future and do incredible
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:57.320]  things and it's that anti selfishness that actually is the most selfish thing of all
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:02.040]  because once you bridge that gap you've now made the connection in the future and have
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:08.800]  now become beyond self-actualized you have now become interdimensionally actualized with
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:16.000]  the full beginning connections of the entire space-time continuum and have entered what
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:23.760]  I can only describe as that absolute Zen moment of purity and total connectedness and that
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:27.800]  is the place the globalist will not look that is the place they fear now I see some big

[02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:00.120]  but you know the unabomber said he was under mind control and then CIA documents got declassified
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:06.440]  that Theodore Kaczynski volunteered and then disappeared for over a decade when he was
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:12.160]  going to Harvard you can look it up in the LA Times in MK ultra mind control experiments
[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:18.640]  but oh you're volunteering for the experiment but once they get into it there's no volunteering
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:23.240]  Las Vegas massacre gunman Stephen Paddock I talked about this the day of the shooting
[02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:26.040]  the day after the shooting I talked about the mind control and said it should be looked
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:31.640]  at not to make him a shooter but to be the patsy Las Vegas massacre gunman Stephen Paddock
[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:36.120]  was paranoid that he was the victim of government mind control according to prostitute has stated
[02:48:36.120 --> 02:48:39.800]  his infamous Mandalay hotel suite they tried to cover up that she stayed there with him
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:44.000]  by the way their article that has received virtually no attention the radar reveals that
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:49.720]  had called girl who was booked to see Paddock earlier that day before the massacre was reported
[02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:55.160]  missing by her boyfriend after shooting was up to 58 dead and 800 injured according to
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:49:02.720]  the sex worker named a Kayla the prostitute was telling girls after work but she was scared
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:06.200]  something would happen to her and folks told her about it get out of there you'll be dead
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:14.200]  in 45 minutes mackayla worked as Paddock $6,000 a night prostitute slept with him the infamous
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:21.800]  Mandalay hotel suite from which Paddock launches deadly assault she saw Paddock two or three
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:27.000]  times a month for the 64-year-old gunman volunteered to be her sugar daddy so let's explain something
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:33.160]  here he's got this nothing job but he's wandering hundreds of thousands of dollars a week in
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:37.160]  front of people through things has these airplanes going to the Middle East flying around the
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:42.120]  Islamic group comes to town Saudi Arabia is having a function their military function
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:47.840]  the breakaway groups go to get guns from him they use that to launch the attack and the
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:51.080]  whole thing some measures of Trump that's what I was told by high-level federal sources
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:55.080]  because the whole story was fake and of course it's all starting to come out just as we told
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:50:03.200]  you big story upon infowars.com also false tsunami warnings sent to East Coast Gulf of
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:08.000]  Mexico and Caribbean this never happens the missile warning to all of this is meant to
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  spook the country into financial collapse just like the globalists did to Russia over
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:18.800]  and over again the last 18 years and admittedly it's been declassified they've done that again
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:22.680]  the only kinship with Russia is we're fighting the same globalist they're pulling the same
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:27.960]  crap does it mean Trump's perfect no but we're trying to get control of our country again
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:31.480]  and so if we judge Trump just by the economics they can try to take that away I think they're
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:37.120]  going to fail more importantly is judging it by what happens culturally and don't forget
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:42.200]  this huge story that no one pointed out we have it on infowars.com it's got no coverage
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:46.760]  I didn't know this you got Uma Thurman saying they spit on her they made her crash cars
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:51.160]  they said they didn't they should release the video her knocked out that they abused
[02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:55.480]  you know that why she abused women and then he threatens to sewer even though there's
[02:50:55.480 --> 02:51:00.040]  hundreds of witnesses to sex assaults rapes you name it he's just back to where he was
[02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:05.640]  back to threatening everybody even all the media keeps defending it they try to crucify
[02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:13.040]  other people with no proof shocking bombshell Quentin Tarantino defends Polansky's pedophile
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:19.040]  rape of a little girl says sex with 13 year old isn't rape director statements even shocked
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:28.920]  Howard Stern so I mean another degenerate another whatever shocking people with stuff
[02:51:28.920 --> 02:51:32.560]  like Pulp Fiction which is an okay film he's got a lot of good actors but a bunch of the
[02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:39.480]  crap movies unwatchable and he's just so arrogant he walked over me all dweebed out at some
[02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:44.880]  premiere of a movie I know it was it was a what was it it was a premiere was a re-showing
[02:51:44.880 --> 02:51:48.960]  with the director of exercise suit by the way was former CIA that was admitted and he also
[02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:51.840]  had the French connection so I came to see the French connection I didn't say for the
[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:56.080]  double shelling you had to pay for the actresses didn't want to watch it and I walk out he
[02:51:56.080 --> 02:52:00.920]  comes over he's like oh you're the conspiracy guy oh he just looked like he had a genetic
[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:03.520]  disorder or something which I'm not putting out how he looks it was just in person he's
[02:52:03.520 --> 02:52:09.360]  even more idiotious and then one of his little minions scrabbled over as my then pregnant
[02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:15.200]  wife with our first born going down the big stairs there jumped down with his feet and
[02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:20.920]  tried to hit my ex-wife's feet he's a witness of this to make her go down and lose the child
[02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:28.040]  and I just never forget I looked up and there was the newspaper reporter head at right next
[02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:33.200]  to Tarantino with the guy and I didn't beat his ass because it was so crazy because oh
[02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:38.240]  I'm sorry it's an accident it's an accident so there's my Quentin Tarantino story and
[02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:44.200]  there's my ex-wife like seven months pregnant and I got Tarantino and some little goon going
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:48.680]  around and I ever see Tarantino again I've thought about this a lot I'll give him a little
[02:52:48.680 --> 02:52:54.240]  piece of my mind that's a guarantee because man the hindsight is 20-20 and I just you
[02:52:54.240 --> 02:53:00.320]  know I never told that story there's my Quentin Tarantino story and that's what went on that's
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:06.240]  what happened he was there look it up check it and that's the type of person he is and
[02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:12.040]  I know the name of the guy that tried to kick my wife down the stairs all of it and it's
[02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:17.000]  just it's unbelievable and again so why did you beat his ass it's like it's so surreal
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:21.080]  and the person saying sorry sorry sorry and that person came after me later and did a
[02:53:21.080 --> 02:53:25.640]  bunch of stuff and then I found out what it was about they see they're spiritually dialed
[02:53:25.640 --> 02:53:31.040]  in but they're evil force and that was 16 years ago my son's 15 about to be 16 that
[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:39.160]  was 16 years ago while he was gestating in my ex-wife and I didn't understand it then
[02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:43.000]  why he hated me so much why he saw me out there when the movie let out there was all
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:46.360]  these big crowds and he come up and spoke you know introduced the Prince Connection
[02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:50.160]  guy and I'm sitting there and you know back then it was a really trendy thing Hollywood
[02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:54.000]  was kind of moving here but you know and you go see really cool movies and hear directors
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:59.080]  all the time that's what launched Alamo Draft House and I'll never forget feeling somebody
[02:53:59.080 --> 02:54:03.160]  look at me and seeing him like 30 feet away going that big chin all looking crazy and
[02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:06.120]  kind of addling over what are you doing here getting in like sand slipping and walking
[02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:13.720]  off and then I'm like hey let's get out of here and 40 seconds later man boom so you
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:20.440]  will talk about evil he radiates it radiates it and I guess it was just so shocking when
[02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:23.640]  I looked up and there was Tarantino because that old Alamo had like you know the big
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:29.400]  long 20 stairs they had the old deal down it the big balcony stairs I remember looking
[02:54:29.400 --> 02:54:32.960]  up there by thinking it was funny and just like let's get out of here because that demon
[02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:38.320]  was right up there at the top of the stairs and it was just like I like this little little
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:44.200]  Joker guy giggling and laughing up sorry it's now it's an accident Alex and I remember when
[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:47.640]  I was sitting there I see I was in their club I didn't know you'd read that the paper go
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:51.640]  this sounds interesting I like the French connection I like the actors and I remember
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:56.400]  that minion came over to me while I was sitting on the side of a road like five rows back
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:01.080]  and said who worked for the local paper and said oh you're here what are you doing here
[02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:06.360]  you shouldn't be here I forgot that part and two hours later they let me know you don't
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:12.280]  come around us we'll spit on them a thermo we'll make her crash the car we'll you know
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:17.640]  we'll cover up her Weinstein raping women every day and that's something just raving
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:28.360]  demons raving demons and that's a true story 100% so people wonder why I'm so pissed off
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:35.840]  at Tarantino I saw him one more time in a restaurant about 10 years ago and almost walked
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:42.880]  over there and told him get up but I just didn't do it I can't prove that he was in
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:49.240]  on that even though that was his little minion I don't know but imagine the evil that radiates
[02:55:49.240 --> 02:55:53.760]  he's doing that constantly Tarantino what was that I was that special he's screwing
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:59.160]  people and dominating them and getting them under his little filthy thumb because it turns
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:04.800]  out he was a Renfield for Hollywood he for decades supplied things to him but he was
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:12.200]  sick enough and filthy enough for them to love him so that's your Tarantino God so hope

[03:00:57.160 --> 03:01:05.120]  connection dialed in by the way we don't tell these stories to sound big I don't want to
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:09.640]  be part of Hollywood I'm already been in some movies they wanted me to be a bunch of others
[03:01:09.640 --> 03:01:14.120]  I didn't do it I would do it if it was the right directors the right people to get a
[03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:18.200]  good message across and some of those opportunities have come and some I've refused some have gone
[03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:23.720]  and some others I thought about doing but only now that Hollywood's fully collapsed
[03:01:23.720 --> 03:01:30.600]  only to then route them and show them what it's really all about but they have at least
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:38.520]  eight or nine TV shows right now where they admit that the characters Alex Jones and
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:44.360]  they say on the show it's Alex Jones or they name the episode info wars or Alex Jones where
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:49.280]  pedophiles are named Alex Jones killers are named Alex Jones people don't want to kill
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:52.680]  the female president or Alex Jones because they're going to have with all the scripts
[03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:58.200]  you know despite the fact that every loss will homeland boss of season seven Trump inspiration
[03:01:58.200 --> 03:02:04.360]  Alex Jones and rip Peter Quinn so this is a popular television show which is millions
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:08.840]  of people every week and you tune into it just give you an example of what I'm talking
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:12.640]  about here oh this isn't the marked up copy I had had my own copy I guess there's two
[03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:18.320]  of these here and it says so this is the bad guys based on all shows they go oh yeah we
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:23.680]  sit there for hours and we watch it and we can't believe all the things he says and we
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:30.800]  put it in the show we'll know you don't put what I said in the show I'm running the fake
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:35.280]  news on the show I'm a racist on the show I have hundreds and hundreds of employees
[03:02:35.280 --> 03:02:41.040]  just to put out fake news and I said you know this Jake Weber who plays my part man I like
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:47.320]  to get in the ring with him and I said that's metaphysically and they go oh Alex says they
[03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:54.040]  said how much Alex Jones you've been watching to the research and they say oh a bunch they
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:58.320]  goes on to say have you heard anything about Jones is he watching and now the answer is
[03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:03.840]  no I just see some of the clips that get sent Alex Jones challenge Jake Weber to a fight
[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:08.960]  to a fist fight and what Alex Jones doesn't realize is that Jake Weber has been a boxer
[03:03:08.960 --> 03:03:13.720]  for 30 years so I would oh really you want a bunch of titles went well when much advice
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:17.080]  is just saying you're a boxer and being a boxer so I would not recommend getting in
[03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:22.880]  the ring with him I want to get in the ring with him even more now my point is is I said
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:27.680]  you steal my identity you steal our studio you say you're me in interviews and then you
[03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:32.600]  say stuff like you don't like black people in my voice how about I sue you how about
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:37.400]  that I mean I can only put up with so much of your identity theft because you steal my
[03:03:37.400 --> 03:03:43.120]  identity and then you go around committing these virtual crimes in my name so I can then
[03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:47.680]  be censored and attacked in the real world while Hollywood pisses in my face and the
[03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:54.440]  American people's face and I'm sick of you I'm not flattered that they got shows where
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:04:00.640]  that you know they the daughter of May West the famous girlfriend of Anton LeVay simulates
[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:06.000]  being raped as Millie Weaver in a show called info war by Antifa at Charlottesville and
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:11.600]  then the jury lets them go and says good job raping women see that's their whole thing
[03:04:11.600 --> 03:04:17.600]  how do we get the public to cheer a woman being raped and make it liberal and cool but then
[03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:25.600]  destroy many women's society together claiming all sex is rape and maybe her daughter into
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:32.200]  devil or spur like me west I mean she looks like me west the point is is she's up there
[03:04:32.200 --> 03:04:36.760]  playing the part of Millie Weaver getting gang raped with blood all over the name of
[03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:41.680]  the shows info wars on lawn order lawn order episode and it's all just a message we're

[03:06:21.600 --> 03:06:26.400]  pretty incredible true stories in the last 15-20 minutes the last hour I run in with
[03:06:26.400 --> 03:06:33.080]  Quentin Tarantino and the fact that my ex-wife at the time she was right about it she said
[03:06:33.080 --> 03:06:36.880]  how dare you not beat that guy's ass trying to kick me downstairs I said I couldn't believe
[03:06:36.880 --> 03:06:41.320]  it I couldn't believe and then there's Quentin Tarantino right there and a local newspaper
[03:06:41.320 --> 03:06:48.440]  writer all setting it up it was just too unbelievable but so was Quentin Tarantino going on Howard
[03:06:48.440 --> 03:06:52.360]  Stern and saying hey I think it's okay to have sex with 13 year olds you know drug them
[03:06:52.360 --> 03:06:56.040]  up it's not right if you drug them up and have sex with them because that's what happened
[03:06:56.040 --> 03:07:07.680]  with Roman Polanski but see everything is coming out everything look at those two predators
[03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:12.520]  together so I asked Paul Watson while we're on the subject of info wars with the markets
[03:07:12.520 --> 03:07:17.640]  and everything else that's happening they know that Trump's trying to bring back prosperity
[03:07:17.640 --> 03:07:24.240]  globalism siphons off prosperity Paul globalism picks winners it creates a 1% that did have
[03:07:24.240 --> 03:07:29.120]  a third of the wealth that has 70% of it they're the same ones bitching saying get rid of capitalism
[03:07:29.120 --> 03:07:33.520]  get rid of the ladder of success but just like Russia for decades has been under sanctions
[03:07:33.520 --> 03:07:38.960]  and economic attack it made them more independent and homogenous economically and made them stronger
[03:07:38.960 --> 03:07:44.880]  so I want prosperity that comes with getting out from under globalism but at the end of
[03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:49.000]  the day if they try to hold us hostage with that we have to know they're the ones killing
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:54.080]  the prosperity and they're the ones that have done it not Trump not nationalism Trump and
[03:07:54.080 --> 03:08:01.200]  nationalism from the UK to the US to Catalan to Italy to Brazil to to the Czech Republic
[03:08:01.200 --> 03:08:09.640]  to Czechoslovakia to what's happening in in Romania and Hungary and Poland and in Austria
[03:08:09.640 --> 03:08:13.880]  they're all going nationalist and suddenly economies are coming back in the globalist
[03:08:13.880 --> 03:08:18.320]  devastate the economy to try to bring us under heel we've all got to understand we're just
[03:08:18.320 --> 03:08:26.440]  like the UK for you know several years of being encircled by you boats and you know family
[03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:30.680]  of mine that went down in the North Atlantic trying to get lynn least weapons of the UK
[03:08:30.680 --> 03:08:35.720]  you guys didn't give up under the year and a half of the Blitzkrieg and and and the blitz
[03:08:35.720 --> 03:08:40.880]  and the bombs dropping we need that church hilly in speech well I want to you can't
[03:08:40.880 --> 03:08:46.160]  find the full speech but they actually gave I never record stuff in movie theaters but
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:51.240]  I didn't record the audio of the darkest hour where a kind of a scissified version of Churchill
[03:08:51.240 --> 03:08:54.280]  gives the speech about you know we're going to go on to the end whatever the cost may
[03:08:54.280 --> 03:08:58.880]  be and it's going to get rough but we're not going to give up people understand Trump was
[03:08:58.880 --> 03:09:05.320]  going to be the the slick way kind of the rapture version of getting out of hell hopefully
[03:09:05.320 --> 03:09:10.760]  but if they try to shut all this down capitulating the globalist means abject slavery and economic
[03:09:10.760 --> 03:09:15.440]  servitude Paul Watson how do you connect that equation together about where we stand we
[03:09:15.440 --> 03:09:19.440]  need to know we try to do this via prosperity and I think it's already coming back and hopefully
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:23.560]  it stays there but we can't be held hostage to that with the globalists know whatever
[03:09:23.560 --> 03:09:28.120]  they pull we're going to be nationalist and free marketeers and fight even harder because
[03:09:28.120 --> 03:09:31.920]  they want their money to we've got to play chicken with them and let them know we're
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:37.720]  not going to turn the wheel we're going in through and beyond you catch what I'm saying
[03:09:37.720 --> 03:09:44.880]  well Alex the Dow is now it just almost went up 500 points it went it went from 330 to 500
[03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:49.880]  in the space of about five minutes so I guess today it's all thanks to Obama again right
[03:09:49.880 --> 03:09:54.640]  they've spent the past year saying that all these economic numbers the record highs in
[03:09:54.640 --> 03:10:00.160]  the stock market is all thanks to Obama yesterday and Friday obviously plunged so that was thanks
[03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:06.040]  to Trump now it's back up 484 points coming to the close of the session I guess here in
[03:10:06.040 --> 03:10:10.320]  a couple of hours so I guess now it's thanks to Obama all over again and that's the thing
[03:10:10.320 --> 03:10:17.560]  Alex 81 times the Dow hit a high during Trump's first year in office the mainstream media
[03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:23.480]  reported on it only 17 times and what of course did we see yesterday complete wall to wall
[03:10:23.480 --> 03:10:28.960]  coverage and people on Twitter the verified checkmarks as you would expect saying oh well
[03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:34.000]  that's it it's over for Trump now isn't it listen we had a year of the left saying oh
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:38.480]  the stock market's got you know nothing to do with mainstream Wall Street's got nothing
[03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:42.920]  to do with Main Street this has got nothing to do with Americans ordinary Americans in
[03:10:42.920 --> 03:10:48.400]  their financial situation soon as it drops 1500 points oh it's got everything to do with
[03:10:48.400 --> 03:10:52.880]  it so it's just the same narrative over and over again for a year they said it was all
[03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:57.960]  thanks to Obama as soon as it tanks they turn around and blame Trump so they're gonna do
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:02.520]  it again whether this is a correction or not remains to be seen but I agree I'm saying
[03:11:02.520 --> 03:11:07.400]  aren't there things even more important than money it's great to have that but we culturally
[03:11:07.400 --> 03:11:13.320]  and societally and sovereignty wise what we're getting is what it's all about if you don't
[03:11:13.320 --> 03:11:19.240]  have that the prosperity doesn't flow well no it's I mean but if you take regulation
[03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:24.480]  often you encourage small and medium businesses to grow doesn't matter whether the stock market
[03:11:24.480 --> 03:11:29.160]  goes back and forth exactly hundred thousand points the fundamentals are there for continued
[03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:34.520]  growth and to encourage people to start businesses not to shut them down with regulation which
[03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:38.960]  is what Obama did for eight years and what did you make of the leftist media all celebrating
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:43.840]  oh look it's down it's Trump's fault I mean they're I mean these people are absolutely
[03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:49.640]  trying to destroy us they want Americans to fail I mean you saw it and you know people
[03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:54.640]  were triggered during the state of the union fleeing the the chamber there they refused
[03:11:54.640 --> 03:12:00.000]  to clap record low black unemployment Alex let's face it this is what I said in a tweet
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:05.800]  today if there was a global economic collapse many on the left would completely embrace
[03:12:05.800 --> 03:12:10.760]  it and welcome it because they would use it to justify their Trump derangement syndrome
[03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:15.560]  they're quite willing to see America fail so long as it means they can point the finger
[03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:20.160]  at Trump they want America to fail at least like being on a plane and wanting the pilot
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:26.100]  and the co-pilot to have heart exactly I've had liberals confront me and I go in your
[03:12:26.100 --> 03:12:34.040]  401k up 35% they go yeah but I don't care there was a I think it was who was the Eichman
[03:12:34.040 --> 03:12:38.720]  who said the guy who was triggered by the gif who filed a police report for assault because
[03:12:38.720 --> 03:12:44.200]  he said he had epilepsy because of a gif image that guy before you could probably pull up
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:48.880]  the tweet if they can find it he said he'd taken all of his kids money out of the stock
[03:12:48.880 --> 03:12:54.480]  market because it was guaranteed to collapse under Trump remember this was the narrative
[03:12:54.480 --> 03:13:00.440]  as soon as Trump won the stock market the economy now absolutely guaranteed to collapse
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:04.840]  is back up 400 points yeah it's going to go back and forth but they all took their money
[03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:08.960]  out of the stock market as some kind of virtue you're talking about Kirk Eichman wall the
[03:13:08.960 --> 03:13:14.960]  technical porn guy were aliens rape children Eichman wall that's the guy is that's what
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:19.680]  that's a tweet that has not aged well where he's talking about he took all his kids money
[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:25.800]  out the stock market and it went up what was it like 30% since he made that tweet at least
[03:13:25.800 --> 03:13:29.640]  so obviously there's a correction and it you know it's related to the Federal Reserve
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:33.880]  economists will tell you that but these things are going to go back and forth if you hit
[03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:39.200]  what was it 25,000 in such a short space of time obviously you're going to get a correction
[03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:44.720]  but as you said it's the fundamental underlying principles have taken off the regulation encouraging
[03:13:44.720 --> 03:13:51.400]  people to start businesses lowering tax rates if you stick with that method things are generally
[03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:54.600]  going to pick up things are generally going to be all right whatever the stock market
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:13:59.800]  does tell us what you got coming up Paul Joseph Watson the next 40 minutes I'm going to butt
[03:13:59.800 --> 03:14:04.720]  out here and let you honcho this operation thanks Alex yeah we've got Michael Heaver
[03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:08.560]  coming up at the bottom of the hour he is the reporter and commentator over at West
[03:14:08.560 --> 03:14:13.280]  Monster dot com because we're talking about the UK and this is what I want to get into
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:18.840]  now we've got a headline up on Sky News Theresa May to announce crackdown on social media
[03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:26.880]  abuse we've literally got hundreds of ISIS jihadists 425 at least they've returned from
[03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:32.400]  Syria and Iraq and have been allowed back into the United Kingdom they're talking about
[03:14:32.400 --> 03:14:37.800]  reintegrating them giving them benefits giving them social housing put of them putting them
[03:14:37.800 --> 03:14:44.040]  ahead of the queue of ordinary British citizens for council houses for free housing for tax
[03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:51.880]  breaks for social welfare benefits 425 at least ISIS jihadists they've not they're not even
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:57.880]  tracking a significant portion of those ISIS jihadists they refuse to say how many they
[03:14:57.880 --> 03:15:04.400]  say it's a significant portion so we're looking at hundreds of hardened ISIS militants who
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:08.680]  have come back into the country who are not being tracked who are not being surveilled
[03:15:08.680 --> 03:15:15.200]  meanwhile the prime minister Theresa May is devoting government resources at a time when
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:19.400]  the police forces are completely stretched when they're begging for people to come out
[03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:26.440]  of retirement to join the police they're putting resources into patrolling online social media
[03:15:26.440 --> 03:15:31.280]  abuse so basically people being mean to each other on the internet that's what they're
[03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:38.080]  focusing on you got 3400 people being arrested every year roughly in the UK for things they
[03:15:38.080 --> 03:15:45.360]  say online that they treat Facebook as being more of a threat than returning ISIS jihadists
[03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:49.400]  comments on Facebook and more of a threat is ridiculous we'll get back into it after the

[03:23:19.760 --> 03:23:26.760]  headline tereza mate who announced crackdown on returning isis jihadist no social media
[03:23:26.760 --> 03:23:35.000]  abuse so basically they want to devote a bunch of resources to quote the fact that women
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:40.760]  gay people and members of ethnic minorities are being abused on social media now while
[03:23:40.760 --> 03:23:47.360]  all abuse online abuse or whatever kind of abuse is a porn this is not a major problem
[03:23:47.360 --> 03:23:52.640]  given how stretched our police forces are in the united kingdom given how little money
[03:23:52.640 --> 03:24:00.440]  we have to devote to them given how we have over 400 isis jihadists returning being allowed
[03:24:00.440 --> 03:24:06.200]  back into the country it's not like oh look maybe we shouldn't let hardened isis terrorists
[03:24:06.200 --> 03:24:11.680]  back into the country no that hasn't even been part of the debate let him in roll out
[03:24:11.680 --> 03:24:17.120]  a friggin red carpet they're even talking about giving them social housing benefits
[03:24:17.120 --> 03:24:22.000]  putting them to the front of the queue in front of ordinary british citizens to get
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  these benefits so we can reintegrate isis jihadists into society so we don't lose a generation
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:34.120]  of young people while i'm afraid they're already lost and when you've got people being moaned
[03:24:34.120 --> 03:24:38.320]  down on the streets you can't afford to be limp rested with this kind of thing but what
[03:24:38.320 --> 03:24:46.480]  is the government concentrating on online abuse misogyny on social media i mean they
[03:24:46.480 --> 03:24:54.320]  did the studies which found that 50 percent of quote misogyny was the responsibility of
[03:24:54.320 --> 03:25:01.160]  other women so they paint it as this big evil patriarchal abuse of women 50 percent of it
[03:25:01.160 --> 03:25:07.080]  is other women the studies have proven that and it's Theresa May again at the forefront
[03:25:07.080 --> 03:25:13.840]  of this fear mongering about it we've got bigger problems in this country oh and by
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:19.600]  the way you know who gets the most online abuse it's conservatives you look at tommy
[03:25:19.600 --> 03:25:26.320]  robinson he gets death threats every single day he posts them on twitter what do the police
[03:25:26.320 --> 03:25:32.680]  do about it absolutely nothing he literally has to go and find these people himself i
[03:25:32.680 --> 03:25:39.280]  mean look at katie hopkins she gets violent threats on a daily basis look at zach goldsmith
[03:25:39.280 --> 03:25:43.720]  there you see tommy robinson confronting one of the individuals who spewed death threats
[03:25:43.720 --> 03:25:49.040]  at him after being radicalized by this islamist on twitter he went to the police with it they
[03:25:49.040 --> 03:25:55.040]  did absolutely nothing about it now he had zach goldsmith who was the former candidate
[03:25:55.040 --> 03:26:01.240]  for mayor of london he posted yesterday on his twitter account a letter that one of his
[03:26:01.240 --> 03:26:08.400]  constituents had received an 80 year old woman and it said where the real 48 percent these
[03:26:08.400 --> 03:26:13.720]  are people who voted against brexit quote we are coming for you we are going to kill
[03:26:13.720 --> 03:26:19.640]  you now that's not just social media that's a letter being put through the door of an
[03:26:19.640 --> 03:26:25.760]  80 year old woman's house because she voted for brexit so i asked where where exactly
[03:26:25.760 --> 03:26:32.800]  is this abuse being directed they say it's all about gay people ethnic minorities islamophobia
[03:26:32.800 --> 03:26:38.400]  women and yeah that happens but it happens a heck of a lot more from what i've seen to
[03:26:38.400 --> 03:26:45.040]  anyone who dares express an opinion right of chairman mal on twitter at this point the
[03:26:45.040 --> 03:26:52.160]  hate the vitriol is that virulent so they're not talking about that the police whenever
[03:26:52.160 --> 03:26:56.040]  tommy robinson gets a death threat the police do absolutely nothing about it it's a complete
[03:26:56.040 --> 03:27:03.560]  joke so we've got to reason a fronting this program to devote resources to policing speech
[03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:09.720]  on the internet they literally use that term in the article policing the internet that's
[03:27:09.720 --> 03:27:15.560]  not a problem that we should put at the front of the queue when we have literal isis jihadist
[03:27:15.560 --> 03:27:21.600]  roaming free on the streets bright bar headline may government admit significant portion of
[03:27:21.600 --> 03:27:27.120]  returned islamic say jihadist going unpunished they've not just let them in they're not even
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:32.440]  keeping them under surveillance why oh we can't afford it we don't have enough resources oh
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:39.400]  but you've got enough resources to patrol mean comments on twitter who cares we've got
[03:27:39.400 --> 03:27:45.640]  people being moaned down in the streets for god's sake meanwhile we've got this happening
[03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:49.720]  bear in mind again that isis jihadists are roaming the streets and not even being surveilled
[03:27:49.720 --> 03:27:55.280]  tell you who is being surveilled christian teachers england teacher fired for telling

[03:33:34.640 --> 03:33:40.440]  underscore heaver and he is the future prime minister of britain he is michael heaver michael
[03:33:40.440 --> 03:33:48.040]  welcome over playing it slightly but thank you very much now before the break i was talking
[03:33:48.040 --> 03:33:53.320]  about this article which i woke up to this morning absolutely enraged by it as you can
[03:33:53.320 --> 03:33:59.160]  imagine tereza may has announced she'll basically front a new government body or a government
[03:33:59.160 --> 03:34:05.200]  program at least to devote resources to tackling online abuse which basically means mean comments
[03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:10.960]  on the internet to quote better police the internet we've also got the government funding
[03:34:10.960 --> 03:34:16.560]  a dedicated national security unit to tackle fake news and disinformation which we know
[03:34:16.560 --> 03:34:21.160]  is a completely subjective term in michael i know the government can do more than one
[03:34:21.160 --> 03:34:27.920]  thing at a time but can this country really afford to be policing speech so tereza may
[03:34:27.920 --> 03:34:33.560]  can look good and so she can virtue signal or do you think there are more pressing matters
[03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:39.040]  more pressing security matters that we should be concentrating right now and on in this country
[03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:45.080]  well as you mentioned paul i mean the situation in britain now is quite extraordinary in terms
[03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:49.240]  of returning british jihadis this is something that we at west wants to be looking at for
[03:34:49.240 --> 03:34:53.320]  a number of months now and i just want to lay this out to your viewers that aren't aware
[03:34:53.320 --> 03:34:57.160]  of this this isn't just a british phenomenon we're seeing this go on across europe and
[03:34:57.160 --> 03:35:02.840]  right across the world hundreds and hundreds of jihadis that have been so committed to
[03:35:02.840 --> 03:35:08.440]  islamic state that they've gone out and supported islamic state in syria and iraq wish their
[03:35:08.440 --> 03:35:13.400]  lives to get there these people are out there they've about half of them have come back
[03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:18.080]  that went from britain have returned and we are now in a situation where the government
[03:35:18.080 --> 03:35:24.840]  are basically saying a significant proportion aren't deemed to be of national security risk
[03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:30.280]  can you imagine how dedicated a jihadist how sick you have to be to go and support these
[03:35:30.280 --> 03:35:36.360]  people you know burn people alive you know rape children abuse people kill people torture
[03:35:36.360 --> 03:35:41.640]  people these people are so committed they've gone over there hundreds have come back and
[03:35:41.640 --> 03:35:46.440]  our government our security services apparently are deeming them hundreds of them to not be
[03:35:46.440 --> 03:35:51.400]  worth scrutinizing in terms of national security that many of them may be walking the street
[03:35:51.400 --> 03:35:57.040]  without any analysis at all i and this isn't just going in britain as i say this is right
[03:35:57.040 --> 03:36:03.600]  across europe and as you mentioned to have to have hundreds of these people walking around
[03:36:03.600 --> 03:36:08.240]  in britain i think is horrifying what's even more horrifying is it's going as i say right
[03:36:08.240 --> 03:36:13.000]  across europe in other countries and you're right the priority here the number one priority
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:19.560]  for any government should be to protect the public to protect the people of those countries
[03:36:19.560 --> 03:36:26.640]  and yet we see this incredible situation where hundreds and hundreds of jihadis hardened
[03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:33.800]  potentially trained to kill are back in the country and being assessed as not being of
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:39.960]  national security concern it simply doesn't add up and i think we need more answers on
[03:36:39.960 --> 03:36:47.080]  exactly who these people are well exactly i mean i contrast it to this the fact that
[03:36:47.080 --> 03:36:52.600]  per year this was a rough number british police arrest three thousand three hundred ninety
[03:36:52.600 --> 03:36:58.280]  five people every year for quite offensive online comments those are people who say things
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:03.160]  on facebook yes you may be offended by them they may be racist they may be islamophobic
[03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:08.200]  but they've got plenty of resources to devote to that meanwhile you know the bbc report
[03:37:08.200 --> 03:37:13.680]  it's not practical for police to investigate all crime so it's not just with the terrorism
[03:37:13.680 --> 03:37:18.600]  threats with the crime threat as well and yet that that constant therese may is constantly
[03:37:18.600 --> 03:37:24.840]  banging on about oh online abuse yet that's actual resources that's actual police time
[03:37:24.840 --> 03:37:29.400]  that's been dedicated to that we also had another story today michael which i mentioned
[03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:35.720]  on the show there was a teacher in bristol who was fired for telling a lesbian student
[03:37:35.720 --> 03:37:42.760]  god loves you a christian teacher they reported her to the government's counterterrorism program
[03:37:42.760 --> 03:37:49.720]  the prevent program as a radicalization threat she was fired from her job you know and meanwhile
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:54.600]  those are the people being reported as terrorists and she was investigated it wasn't just laughed
[03:37:54.600 --> 03:37:58.640]  off as it should have been meanwhile as he said you got hundreds of actual terrorists
[03:37:58.640 --> 03:38:04.480]  that have come back from from syria from iraq fighting for isis potentially beheading people
[03:38:04.480 --> 03:38:08.400]  stoning people to death and hundreds of them have just been let loose they're not even
[03:38:08.400 --> 03:38:13.840]  under surveillance do you think it's it's actual you know it's actually related to a resource
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:19.720]  issue or is it just this general disregard for not treating islamic terrorism with the
[03:38:19.720 --> 03:38:24.520]  importance it should be treated well let me say this cool i mean there's a new defense
[03:38:24.520 --> 03:38:29.240]  secretary in britain called gavin williamson and he came and this is what really perplexes
[03:38:29.240 --> 03:38:34.440]  me about this situation he came in and gavin williamson basically said rightly in my opinion
[03:38:34.440 --> 03:38:39.720]  that jihadis that go abroad and support islamic state should either be killed and certainly
[03:38:39.720 --> 03:38:45.800]  should never be let back into britain and yet when you have a defense secretary in government
[03:38:45.800 --> 03:38:52.520]  saying that the british policy appears to be something very different so it seems to me
[03:38:52.520 --> 03:38:56.280]  that on one hand you've got these ministers saying things like the brewery shrew was another
[03:38:56.280 --> 03:39:00.240]  and i remember saying that these people shouldn't be allowed back they should be killed abroad
[03:39:00.240 --> 03:39:05.200]  and yet the actual policy is that hundreds are back so then i start to ask the question
[03:39:05.200 --> 03:39:11.040]  poll then i start to ask the question have these people been allowed back by the government
[03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:17.720]  has there been a deal done some sort of conversation had or is it the case that a complete incompetence
[03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:20.960]  and weak borders have actually allowed these people to return and the government have only
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:26.520]  found out about it upon their return because i don't see how you marry up the fact that
[03:39:26.520 --> 03:39:30.280]  government ministers including a defense secretary are basically saying you should kill these
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:34.800]  people they shouldn't come back with the fact that right now in this country hundreds of
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:40.040]  them are back i don't i think we need a serious answer on that how we can have as i say the
[03:39:40.040 --> 03:39:44.200]  government saying one thing and yet government policy seems to be pointing towards a completely
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:48.800]  different reality and a quite scary one to be quite honest with you it's absolutely
[03:39:48.800 --> 03:39:53.000]  incredible and i mean after the last terror attack and it was a london bridge attack you
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:56.800]  know to reason they said enough is enough and still she's she's continuing with these
[03:39:56.800 --> 03:40:01.760]  policies of treating online mean comments on the internet as more of a threat more of
[03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:06.000]  a concern than actual terrorists on the streets is absolutely baffling to me let's talk about
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:10.320]  to reason me you know she was in a position where she could have seized on this populist
[03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:16.240]  wave that swept europe over the past 18 months she completely failed she failed to be bold
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:19.600]  which is what she needed to be she would have had the support of the population if she'd
[03:40:19.600 --> 03:40:24.440]  done that you know she's got the leadership skills of a of a dishcloth she keeps getting
[03:40:24.440 --> 03:40:29.040]  in spats with trump you know just a virtue signal even more about how she's you know
[03:40:29.040 --> 03:40:33.180]  not like trump you know she's on course to lose an election according to the current
[03:40:33.180 --> 03:40:39.240]  polls to a man who literally supports terrorist groups and socialist policies that erect nations
[03:40:39.240 --> 03:40:44.960]  like venezuela that's how pathetic she is how on earth michael is to reason me still
[03:40:44.960 --> 03:40:50.240]  in office and what's it going to take to turf her out well it's quite credible if you look
[03:40:50.240 --> 03:40:55.520]  at that um the davos event where you had donald trump loud loud his vision which is basically
[03:40:55.520 --> 03:41:00.840]  this phenomenal vision for an america that had strong borders that welcomed only those
[03:41:00.840 --> 03:41:05.760]  um that had something to contribute and wanted to be part of the sort of his vision for america
[03:41:05.760 --> 03:41:10.120]  and you can contrast it that with therese amaze beach where no one can actually remember
[03:41:10.120 --> 03:41:16.080]  what much of what she said because it was just so dull so boring and yeah what you see
[03:41:16.080 --> 03:41:20.600]  now in the conservative party is that all of the favorites to now succeed to reason man
[03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:24.720]  is quite a bit of speculation here in the uk of course that she may be ousted all of
[03:41:24.720 --> 03:41:28.720]  the favorites to succeed to reason maya jakey breeze mob michael gov and borris johnson
[03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:34.160]  all campaigned um four league four brexit in the referendum we had here in britain and
[03:41:34.160 --> 03:41:38.800]  i think that speaks to me in that people have had enough really of this slow plotting approach
[03:41:38.800 --> 03:41:45.400]  you know a lot of people went out and voted leave to get back control of britain's borders
[03:41:45.400 --> 03:41:48.880]  and we're now being told by the government that's not going to happen until at least
[03:41:48.880 --> 03:41:54.960]  2021 oh and by the way by the way the government want you to believe that in 2019 when we leave
[03:41:54.960 --> 03:42:00.600]  the EU we then have to enter a transition period whereby we'll still be uh having to
[03:42:00.600 --> 03:42:05.920]  listen to EU laws and we'll have to have to implement new EU laws as well the whole things
[03:42:05.920 --> 03:42:10.440]  are complete dog's dinner and that's why you're now seeing brexit tears surgeon support that's
[03:42:10.440 --> 03:42:15.000]  why you're seeing serious doubts into reason man brexit is not being delivered and there's
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:20.960]  a lot of impatience growing and a lot of anger as well and i want to get into more into brexit
[03:42:20.960 --> 03:42:25.480]  after the break i put out a tweet a couple of days ago you know retweet for reese mob
[03:42:25.480 --> 03:42:30.400]  being prime minister i think you've got about 10 000 retweets talking about mog mentham he's
[03:42:30.400 --> 03:42:35.240]  got a hell of a lot of mog mentham since that incident at the university on fingers friday
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:40.800]  where he confronted not in an aggressive way but to actually shut down and shame those
[03:42:40.800 --> 03:42:45.520]  thug ish they called them protesters they weren't protesters so there's a lot of momentum
[03:42:45.520 --> 03:42:50.080]  behind mog right now a lot of support we'll talk about after the break with michael heaver
[03:42:50.080 --> 03:42:56.280]  this is the alex germshaw live in four wars dot com we'll be back crooked hillary is added
[03:42:56.280 --> 03:43:01.880]  again gaslighting the population she says trump is using the phyzen memo as a scapegoat
[03:43:01.880 --> 03:43:06.480]  for the russia probe speaking to students at georgetown university clinton said her
[03:43:06.480 --> 03:43:11.960]  loss is attributed to misogyny and sexism but another contributing factor was the outgrowth
[03:43:11.960 --> 03:43:16.320]  of all the anxiety and insecurity playing on some people and leading them on a hunt for
[03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:22.440]  scapegoats but thanks to those damning text messages between two anti trump fbi investigators
[03:43:22.440 --> 03:43:26.600]  we know the russia investigation was meant to be clinton's scapegoat for losing the
[03:43:26.600 --> 03:43:32.680]  2016 election peter struck in his mistress lisa page outlined an insurance policy to
[03:43:32.680 --> 03:43:38.640]  be rail trump should he win the election fbi officials like struck and former deputy director
[03:43:38.640 --> 03:43:43.960]  andrew mccabe were quarterbacking the investigation into clinton's illegal server the phyzen memo
[03:43:43.960 --> 03:43:50.120]  itself details evidence of the clinton campaign colluding with the fbi doj and the state department

[03:47:22.440 --> 03:47:32.040]  host joseph watson we are back live with michael heaver of west monster dot com who hails from
[03:47:32.040 --> 03:47:38.120]  the current acid attack capital of europe as do i london and i wanted to ask michael
[03:47:38.120 --> 03:47:41.800]  about that michael we've seen this surgeon knife crime we're gonna get back into brexit
[03:47:41.800 --> 03:47:46.080]  in a second but we've seen this surgeon knife crime and acid attacks especially over the
[03:47:46.080 --> 03:47:52.160]  course of the last year violent crime way up have we nailed down if there is a correlation
[03:47:52.160 --> 03:47:57.440]  between this surgeon violent crime and acid attacks with mass migration and with over
[03:47:57.440 --> 03:48:05.360]  population well i certainly think the areas of london now become very lawless we saw at
[03:48:05.360 --> 03:48:11.160]  the end of last year a new story emerge of delivery drivers in swathes of london after
[03:48:11.160 --> 03:48:17.520]  certain times at night when it got dark refusing basically to deliver anymore i mean that is
[03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:22.600]  a no-go area i don't know what it is and what we're seeing i think is a lot of different
[03:48:22.600 --> 03:48:27.520]  factors playing into this i think we're seeing a cut in police numbers and law and order
[03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:32.320]  really in britain it's gone so soft now the messages that we send out to our youngsters
[03:48:32.320 --> 03:48:37.280]  are so weak we do not send out a strong enough message and you're right the statistics on
[03:48:37.280 --> 03:48:43.720]  this are absolutely horrendous if you look at something like knife crime 21 increase
[03:48:43.720 --> 03:48:52.680]  year on year gun crime in london up 44 percent since 2014 robberies year on year across the
[03:48:52.680 --> 03:48:59.000]  country up 29 percent reported rape up 29 percent so this isn't a lot of acid attacks
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:02.760]  we're seeing this is a new phenomenon unfortunately that's a scourge on our streets i think there's
[03:49:02.760 --> 03:49:07.240]  a wider context this actually poor which is that we're seeing a complete breakdown in
[03:49:07.240 --> 03:49:12.240]  law and order as a result of a very very weak approach as a result of cutting police numbers
[03:49:12.240 --> 03:49:17.960]  i'm really seeing violent crime especially rising nationally a huge numbers as i say
[03:49:17.960 --> 03:49:23.200]  a 20 percent year on year increase in knife crime knife offenses a 44 percent increase
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:30.240]  in london on gun crime since 2014 these are huge rises in relatively small small amounts
[03:49:30.240 --> 03:49:37.000]  of time so it's clearly not going away anytime soon if we don't change tact in this country
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:40.640]  and start actually having neighborhoods where we see police on the street because you never
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:45.200]  see it anymore then i'm afraid we're going to see this scourge of violence continue i'm afraid
[03:49:46.720 --> 03:49:50.240]  yeah a lot of those police are probably too busy knocking on people's doors because they said
[03:49:50.240 --> 03:49:55.440]  something offensive on facebook again three thousand three hundred and ninety five people
[03:49:55.440 --> 03:49:59.920]  arrested for offensive online comments they said it's not practical for police to investigate
[03:49:59.920 --> 03:50:06.160]  all crime and yet we have this wave of violent crime this wave of acid attacks but don't worry
[03:50:06.160 --> 03:50:12.400]  because sidic corn his main policy over the past month or two has been the implementation of
[03:50:12.400 --> 03:50:18.800]  transgender toilets in london and we know that that's obviously more important than acid attacks
[03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:23.760]  as he said actual no go zones now in areas of london but again the media claims all day long
[03:50:23.760 --> 03:50:28.720]  don't exist they do exist for the people who have to go into them and refuse to do so for their own
[03:50:28.720 --> 03:50:34.960]  safety on a move quick we've got about seven minutes left michael the nhs yesterday trump
[03:50:34.960 --> 03:50:40.560]  tweeted about it uh are based off of what nigel forage said on fox news basically that people
[03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:45.440]  were protesting on the streets about the state of the nhs again it's not a slight against the
[03:50:45.440 --> 03:50:51.600]  people who work for the nhs because that is one hell of a tough job but he drew attention to it
[03:50:51.600 --> 03:50:56.880]  the left again went crazy they don't go crazy when corbin talks about it because he's gone obviously
[03:50:56.880 --> 03:51:01.520]  but when trump talks about the problems with the nhs they go insane because they treat it as some
[03:51:01.520 --> 03:51:06.720]  kind of religious deity that can't be criticized michael does the nhs which for our american
[03:51:06.720 --> 03:51:12.400]  audience is basically socialized healthcare does it really live up to its moniker right now in this
[03:51:12.400 --> 03:51:19.440]  country as the envy of the world well look you've had doctors and nurses in this country now
[03:51:19.440 --> 03:51:25.200]  describe it as third world at times and that's their words not mine and nigel forage was making a
[03:51:25.200 --> 03:51:30.400]  very basic point there's a complete state of denial in britain over this very very basic
[03:51:30.400 --> 03:51:37.120]  fact for the last set of annual population growth figures showed that the uk population increased
[03:51:37.120 --> 03:51:46.160]  by 538 000 in one year that is the highest amount for 70 years now it wasn't all driven by mass
[03:51:46.160 --> 03:51:51.600]  migration but 62 percent of it was these are the official government statistics how can a country
[03:51:51.600 --> 03:51:57.040]  like britain have over half a million a year population growth that's a hell of a lot of
[03:51:57.040 --> 03:52:00.160]  patients there's a hell of a lot of babies there's a hell of a lot of young people there's a hell of a
[03:52:00.160 --> 03:52:06.080]  lot of people needing care how can that not have an impact on hospitals and as i say the thing that
[03:52:06.080 --> 03:52:12.400]  frustrates me over here is you'll see tv report after tv report after tv report with nurses doctors
[03:52:12.400 --> 03:52:17.280]  and fantastic medical staff of them at their wit's end saying we cannot cope with this we've got
[03:52:17.280 --> 03:52:23.600]  people waiting in corridors for hours because we have nowhere to put them and yet never do you see
[03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:30.320]  in any of these reports this correlation with this explosion in population growth as i say 538 000
[03:52:30.320 --> 03:52:35.680]  uk population growth the last set of figures the highest for 70 years and no one makes that correlation
[03:52:35.680 --> 03:52:40.640]  naja ferrage there to do it naja ferrage pointed this out this fact that if you have this rapidly
[03:52:40.640 --> 03:52:45.440]  expanding population it pushes your health system to the limit and yet no one in this country is
[03:52:45.440 --> 03:52:50.400]  talking about it no one wants to deal with it and we see as i say report after report with nurses
[03:52:50.400 --> 03:52:55.440]  doctors and all the rest of it saying i work clothes becoming completely utterly ridiculous we
[03:52:55.440 --> 03:53:00.640]  cannot handle this many people we have too many patients yeah because the population surging
[03:53:00.640 --> 03:53:05.840]  fueled by a mass migration boom that no one wants to talk about no one wants to control and even
[03:53:05.840 --> 03:53:10.080]  after voting for brexit we're not seeing politicians we're not seeing the government saying we're
[03:53:10.080 --> 03:53:13.440]  going to bring down numbers at this time and this is how we're going to do it there is no plan to
[03:53:13.440 --> 03:53:18.880]  do that and again i sense that there's massive dissatisfaction and growing anger at the lack of
[03:53:18.880 --> 03:53:24.080]  action controlling britain's borders and bringing these numbers down to sensible levels i mean i
[03:53:24.080 --> 03:53:28.800]  had conversations with leftists and i asked them did you love you love and support the nhs right
[03:53:28.800 --> 03:53:33.760]  yeah of course and you also support mass uncontrolled immigration and population growth that's
[03:53:33.760 --> 03:53:38.960]  never going to end yeah i support that as well no you can't have both you can't have your cake
[03:53:38.960 --> 03:53:44.000]  and eat it it doesn't work it's collapsing i want to move on to the uh trump visit of course
[03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:49.680]  the corbin corn driven narrative michael is that most brits don't want to see donald trump visit
[03:53:49.680 --> 03:53:54.480]  the uk we've seen a lot of throth frothing and whining about this over the past few months of
[03:53:54.480 --> 03:54:00.000]  course we've had calls to outright ban him from the uk some of which are being supported by councils
[03:54:00.000 --> 03:54:05.760]  in london does that paint an accurate picture of exactly what the people of the uk think about
[03:54:05.760 --> 03:54:11.120]  trump's potential visit well no we've seen new figures out today that show there's been a 14
[03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:16.320]  per cent surge since december and the amount of people in britain that want to see a state visit
[03:54:16.320 --> 03:54:22.080]  from trump the amazing paradox to me paul is that you have barack obama who came to britain let's
[03:54:22.080 --> 03:54:27.440]  not forget before the brexit referendum and basically said if you guys dare dare to vote for
[03:54:27.440 --> 03:54:31.680]  your country's independence you better know you're going to be back at the queue for a trade deal and
[03:54:31.680 --> 03:54:36.000]  then you have president trump who couldn't be further from that who sits down with the british
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:40.480]  prime minister recently and said uh we want to massively increase trade we want to bump the trade
[03:54:40.480 --> 03:54:45.920]  deal we want to create jobs jobs jobs and yet you have idiots in this country who turn around so we
[03:54:45.920 --> 03:54:52.160]  couldn't possibly have the u.s president it's an amazing paradox but no i think opinion is changing
[03:54:52.160 --> 03:54:56.720]  very very quickly i think a lot of the media scrutiny of trump is way over the top here you
[03:54:56.720 --> 03:55:00.320]  talk about things like the dowell jones i mean that's virtually under reported the things that
[03:55:00.320 --> 03:55:04.720]  have gone on the massive economic boom that's on its way in america's virtually under reported
[03:55:04.720 --> 03:55:10.880]  and i think what an amazing prospect it is for brexit britain to have such a strong
[03:55:10.880 --> 03:55:18.320]  ally so openly welcoming of increasing trade uh and and all the rest of it between our two
[03:55:18.320 --> 03:55:22.800]  countries to create jobs i think it's a marvelous thing and i think the european union should be
[03:55:22.800 --> 03:55:26.320]  a little bit worried because some of trump's comments about what he thinks of them aren't
[03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:31.440]  too flattering don't think trump's a fan of the protectionist globalist european union
[03:55:31.440 --> 03:55:37.440]  well exactly i mean when it comes to trump's visit i mean you gotta ask the question at some point
[03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:43.200]  is sadeek karn and his ilk by constantly banging on about how they want to ban trump at what point
[03:55:43.200 --> 03:55:46.880]  are they harming the national interest i mean that's the question that i often ask myself but
[03:55:46.880 --> 03:55:51.440]  we got a couple of minutes left michael just tell people where they can find you on twitter and
[03:55:51.440 --> 03:55:59.280]  about westmonster.com yeah so i'm at uh michael underscore here on twitter it's westmonster.com
[03:55:59.280 --> 03:56:04.320]  little plan words there from westminster here in london where the politicians and laws and the
[03:56:04.320 --> 03:56:09.280]  rest of the establishment hang out where we're trying to challenge that a bit with west monster
[03:56:09.280 --> 03:56:12.880]  and basically you're going to be seeing a lot of more video content and things like that coming up
[03:56:12.880 --> 03:56:17.120]  from us we're basically trying to highlight things guys so many things in britain get under
[03:56:17.120 --> 03:56:22.640]  reported did you know if i'm quick new years uh four young men stabbed to death in four separate
[03:56:22.640 --> 03:56:27.520]  incidents it came and went it was virtually forgotten in a couple of weeks and we've seen
[03:56:27.520 --> 03:56:31.840]  these stabbings we've seen this horrendous surge in violence that's such a scourge that's killing
[03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:37.520]  young men uh at such a rapid rate we're seeing brexit being sold out we're seeing uh things
[03:56:37.520 --> 03:56:42.160]  like illegal immigration that's becoming an absolute nightmare because we've got open borders
[03:56:42.160 --> 03:56:46.320]  we are west monster highlighting all of the these things i'm highlighting all these things
[03:56:46.320 --> 03:56:50.480]  that we've got big momentum uh here in britain and i think people are sick and tired of the
[03:56:50.480 --> 03:56:55.040]  establishment brexit shows that trump's showing that and uh paul your numbers and info will show
[03:56:55.040 --> 03:57:01.360]  that as well indeed they do quick prediction uh give me a yes or no is tereza may going to be the
[03:57:01.360 --> 03:57:06.000]  leader of the conservative party at the next election is she still going to be in power
[03:57:07.520 --> 03:57:13.840]  nope don't think so i hope that i hope that prediction comes to fruition and that we get
