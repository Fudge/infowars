[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:30.440]  Texas Alex Jones we have a corrupt banking empire that has seized control of
[00:30.440 --> 00:37.200]  our country these very same globalist interest have disarmed populations all
[00:37.200 --> 00:45.840]  over the world and they are now seeking to disarm the American people now
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.800]  yesterday on the syndicated broadcast I went over the fact that 200 plus people
[00:50.800 --> 00:55.000]  die a year from deer jumping out in front of them and 88 down average from
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.640]  what is classified as a mass shooting most of those are actually gangs killing
[00:59.640 --> 01:05.160]  each other I added up the numbers it's about 24 people killed in what's real
[01:05.160 --> 01:13.120]  classic cold-blooded premeditated just killing for killing sake the gangs who
[01:13.120 --> 01:17.000]  will have some at least grievance on the surface and there's there's some rhyme
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.920]  and reason the goth video game head rich kid Prozac head syndrome is the
[01:24.920 --> 01:31.320]  only one that we see that is not government author but there are some
[01:31.320 --> 01:34.360]  government operations where they've been caught red-handed staging mass
[01:34.360 --> 01:38.560]  shootings especially in Europe where our own government stage them via
[01:38.560 --> 01:43.520]  operation gladio and the NATO option that has been declassified that program
[01:43.520 --> 01:47.880]  went on from the 50s into the 1980s including mass shootings at schools
[01:47.880 --> 01:53.080]  train stations blowing up school buses shooting up school buses and was used
[01:53.080 --> 01:59.160]  to take guns all over Europe and it has been declassified partially by the US
[01:59.160 --> 02:04.000]  completely by the Italians that it was staged to take the liberties and
[02:04.000 --> 02:13.120]  disarm the people so this could be an operation gladio op operation Ajax was
[02:13.120 --> 02:17.800]  mass shootings to take the guns and Iran in 1953 our government with the
[02:17.800 --> 02:22.600]  British shot up a bunch of mosque and then paid the Muslim leadership to call
[02:22.600 --> 02:26.240]  for gun confiscation so there's been a lot of different things that have
[02:26.240 --> 02:30.400]  happened this fits the MO the MO of it you have a mass guy come in shoot the
[02:30.400 --> 02:35.920]  people they exfiltrate and then of course you have the drugged up patsy you
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.120]  shoot in the head we saw that with the underwear bomber drugged up around the
[02:40.120 --> 02:44.080]  plane we broke the news with eyewitnesses that he was put on the plane by the US
[02:44.080 --> 02:47.280]  government that later came out in congressional hearings with the
[02:47.280 --> 02:53.400]  undersecretary of state so this could be a staged event what we do know is
[02:53.400 --> 03:00.840]  staged is the crocodile tears ridiculous behavior of Obama milking this
[03:00.840 --> 03:06.680]  for every disgusting ounce he can get and he says he will use every executive
[03:06.680 --> 03:11.480]  power he has they did that on cyber security when Congress wouldn't pass it
[03:11.480 --> 03:15.320]  they did it on carbon taxes and shutting down the power plants they did it
[03:15.320 --> 03:22.280]  putting our military under NATO UN command he's done it on every front and
[03:22.280 --> 03:27.080]  has been so duplicitous with his deception on the NDA a patriot act you
[03:27.080 --> 03:33.320]  name it so I would expect and you know we said that three weeks ago in the
[03:33.320 --> 03:37.640]  magazine we said this man wants your guns with an image of Obama sitting on top
[03:37.640 --> 03:41.760]  of the American flag desecrating what it stands for and we explain he will use
[03:41.760 --> 03:46.120]  executive power that's how the article opens to ban all semi-autos handguns and
[03:46.120 --> 03:50.320]  rifles and put you want to know gun by list extra judicially the federal
[03:50.320 --> 03:53.280]  government will just say you're on the list turning your guns we're going to

[04:14.040 --> 04:18.960]  said how they would do this from the beginning so all I'm doing is saying

[04:41.760 --> 04:46.280]  having it that's your gut instinct God gave you but intellectually you can see

[04:50.360 --> 04:54.960]  prime zone as I said a month ago of mass shootings federal buildings being
[04:54.960 --> 04:58.040]  blown up they're going to blame it on the preppers and the Patriots stay with

[08:02.720 --> 08:10.720]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[08:10.720 --> 08:33.460]  we saw it coming from miles and miles and miles and miles we knew the
[08:33.460 --> 08:37.960]  insurance companies owned by the foreign mega banks the derivatives fraudsters
[08:37.960 --> 08:44.600]  wrote the health care act to double premiums in the first year premiums
[08:44.600 --> 08:48.200]  are now set to double according to the Associated Press in Bloomberg in the
[08:48.200 --> 08:54.000]  next 12 months it was already a 24% to 25% increase the last two years since
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.440]  Obamacare became a law just in preparation wasn't hard to see that
[08:59.440 --> 09:03.880]  coming from miles and miles and miles now the government's going to tell you
[09:03.880 --> 09:08.080]  what you can eat what you can do because we're now in a collective now they're
[09:08.080 --> 09:11.280]  going to tell you you've got to have vaccines to get your medical care just
[09:11.280 --> 09:15.040]  like they already do the welfare crowd they control and who they want to kill
[09:15.040 --> 09:20.800]  better than a hammer you see we can see for miles and miles and miles the
[09:20.800 --> 09:24.560]  globalists have done what they're doing to us we're in the jaws of this
[09:24.560 --> 09:30.480]  crocodile they've done this in hundreds of countries there's over 195
[09:30.480 --> 09:35.200]  nations and they've done it in some countries three or four times in a row
[09:35.200 --> 09:41.480]  places like Argentina places like Nigeria places like France places like
[09:41.480 --> 09:46.720]  communist China and now we're going into it we know what their model looks like
[09:46.720 --> 09:52.040]  disarmed population with 80 plus percent taxes of one form or another
[09:52.040 --> 09:58.200]  France is the model it's a global standardized program and they're
[09:58.200 --> 10:05.280]  following an exact blueprint to get our guns because the control freaks
[10:05.280 --> 10:10.720]  understand that if they can't disarm you they can't jack up the crime rate they
[10:10.720 --> 10:14.080]  can't ship in the narcotics into your neighborhood and then launder the money
[10:14.080 --> 10:17.880]  in their big mega banks they can't have you begging for more of a police state
[10:17.880 --> 10:26.600]  and basically martial law on the streets if you're not living in fear the
[10:26.600 --> 10:30.280]  second amendment is not only one of the few rights we've got left with the first
[10:30.280 --> 10:34.640]  amendment tenth amendment you name it under attack the fourth and fifth gone
[10:34.640 --> 10:43.320]  it is a beachhead against all of their tyranny it is a time bomb a bulwark a a
[10:43.320 --> 10:51.120]  dam set up against tyrants 230 plus years ago by the founders of this nation
[10:51.120 --> 10:57.120]  because our nation was born out of gun confiscation the crown couldn't offer
[10:57.120 --> 11:03.600]  security from pirates on the coast or Native Americans to the West but the
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.560]  government said you will turn in all your handguns and all of your rifles you
[11:07.560 --> 11:12.920]  will turn in your muskets and your long rifles you will turn them in and they
[11:12.920 --> 11:21.000]  tried gun confiscation up and down the east coast from Virginia to Maine and
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.960]  people began fighting back everywhere so they called in more soldiers and they
[11:25.960 --> 11:33.880]  started hanging people and killing people and the war started my ancestors in
[11:33.880 --> 11:39.280]  Texas in the 1830s the Mexican government said turn your guns in and they
[11:39.280 --> 11:45.080]  said come and take it and my ancestors in the town of Gonzales said come and
[11:45.080 --> 11:49.720]  take it and refuse to turn their guns in and it all started there they tried to
[11:49.720 --> 11:54.040]  take the guns up in north Texas with Colonel Travis and a big fight started
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.640]  there that's the story of tyrants and people say why do you care about your
[11:58.640 --> 12:04.800]  guns so much it's that a government that wants your guns is a government that
[12:04.800 --> 12:10.620]  wants to enslave you and by the way the government we have is running mass
[12:10.620 --> 12:17.200]  murder operations in not one not two not three not four not five not six not
[12:17.200 --> 12:23.680]  seven not eight not nine not ten more than 14 countries have so-called US
[12:23.680 --> 12:28.280]  special forces and troops there advising governments and rebels depending on
[12:28.280 --> 12:36.440]  the case engaging in unholy massacres Libya now it's over 60,000 dead men women
[12:36.440 --> 12:41.880]  children lined up shot on video we try to show it here on air we try to show it
[12:41.880 --> 12:46.360]  on the TV show YouTube will ban our channel we're talking about NATO planes
[12:46.360 --> 12:50.440]  bombing villages with little girls missing their lower mandible with a big
[12:50.440 --> 12:55.640]  red tongue flapping around in blood spraying out and the howls of pain you
[12:55.640 --> 12:59.040]  think Obama's gonna give a press conference about that and have a little
[12:59.040 --> 13:06.960]  fake tear for you Obama is the slickest demonic New World Order liar I've ever
[13:06.960 --> 13:11.880]  seen he makes Bill Clinton look sorry in comparison getting up there last
[13:11.880 --> 13:15.720]  Friday and then last night and acting like he's gonna cry and pausing and
[13:15.720 --> 13:21.320]  touching the corner of his eye this is the guy explain this to you that his
[13:21.320 --> 13:26.280]  lawyers wrote the NDAA to use the army domestically and to secretly arrest the
[13:26.280 --> 13:32.840]  American people and to torture you and to kill you and it just came out again
[13:32.840 --> 13:38.240]  the CIA grabbing innocent people and raping them because they like to rape
[13:38.240 --> 13:41.440]  people that get into the job but think about what you have to do to get into
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.120]  the CIA and then get into the black ops area and then get selected for the
[13:46.120 --> 13:51.680]  torture sites gee who do you think they hire for that hmm oh we know they hire
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.040]  fired federal jailguards
[13:58.320 --> 14:04.440]  that's who they are people that have been caught raping people oh I was looking
[14:04.440 --> 14:06.960]  I actually found out some of the people that got kicked out of the Texas Youth
[14:06.960 --> 14:10.240]  Commission they were raping kids and the rest of it did you know they went and
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.080]  got contractor jobs I saw a blurb on that a few months ago oh yeah they're
[14:14.080 --> 14:21.960]  serving America right now with people's kids in dungeons right now they enjoy
[14:21.960 --> 14:28.280]  their work that's why they work so hard so this is not the American government
[14:28.280 --> 14:34.560]  this is a foreign banking government and Obama would even criticize Democratic
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.440]  and Republican senators about how I want to take out the secret arrest and you
[14:38.440 --> 14:41.280]  know kill provision and they came out and they said here's your White House
[14:41.280 --> 14:46.280]  letter with your lawyers saying you're demanding it oh that's national security
[14:46.280 --> 14:51.040]  weren't supposed to release those letters then he says don't worry I won't sign it
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.320]  when it passes so opposition would inform don't worry about fighting it
[14:54.320 --> 15:00.120]  Obama's not gonna sign it and then it passed and he said don't worry I won't
[15:00.120 --> 15:08.280]  sign it and I said he will sign it and he did sign it and media matters and
[15:08.280 --> 15:12.000]  salon and all these other globalist organs that poses liberals who are
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.880]  really authoritarians in many cases run by the White House the case of media
[15:15.880 --> 15:20.720]  matters on record they literally make jokes and snicker oh Alex is making
[15:20.720 --> 15:24.960]  jokes about the drones again and then they make it a joke saying I'm making it
[15:24.960 --> 15:30.160]  a joke no it's not funny they make these simpering jokes about eight countries
[15:30.160 --> 15:34.680]  being hit by drones more than 14 nations with all sorts of carnage going on I
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.000]  mean it's now in the LA Times in McClatchy in the New York Times that our
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.880]  government is backing al-Qaeda in a 22-month operation in Syria attacking
[15:44.880 --> 15:49.280]  on all sides out of three countries backed up with missiles they were given
[15:49.280 --> 15:52.880]  anti-aircraft missiles they can now use against our aircraft and they're going
[15:52.880 --> 15:56.200]  into houses and saying we're gonna kill your whole family if you don't drive this
[15:56.200 --> 15:59.640]  truck into that police station and blow it up and the dads say goodbye to their
[15:59.640 --> 16:03.960]  family they're tied up they go get in the vehicle and they drive it and blow it
[16:03.960 --> 16:08.280]  up I mean the folks the videos I won't even watch them anymore of them shopping
[16:08.280 --> 16:14.560]  people's heads off and blowing up churches and blowing up mosque and and then
[16:14.560 --> 16:19.480]  I've got to sit there and I made a video about this titled Obama caught fake
[16:19.480 --> 16:23.920]  crying and it's got a half million views and I noticed that's all the Democrats
[16:23.920 --> 16:28.120]  saying hey let's circulate this video and downvote it so my videos usually are
[16:28.120 --> 16:33.280]  96% 97% positive it's only like 65% positive as they're in there trying to
[16:33.280 --> 16:38.240]  vote it down going you scum Republican you're gonna get it we're gonna kill you

[17:15.280 --> 17:19.000]  say these are real YouTube sites real Twitter sites they say we've written
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.080]  articles about it linking to them these are real sites with long histories
[17:22.080 --> 17:29.880]  they're saying that that the state is going to use their 1.6 billion bullets
[17:29.880 --> 17:34.680]  on us that they're going to put us in reeducation camps haha you Republicans
[17:34.680 --> 17:40.160]  you're going to get it now I mean these are sick people and and you've got
[17:40.160 --> 17:45.000]  Obama going and sucking off the depths of these people and going that they said
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.320]  we want to privately meet with the families you could see him eyeing them
[17:48.320 --> 17:53.840]  in that speech and and literally using nlp because now I started looking into
[17:53.840 --> 17:56.840]  it and he was doing all of this programming stuff I talked to some
[17:56.840 --> 17:59.720]  people that went to the White House recently for a private deal they said
[17:59.720 --> 18:04.680]  it Obama would grab their hand and like give these commands and sit there and
[18:04.680 --> 18:08.120]  they said it was like nlp well he was doing that in the speech last night
[18:08.120 --> 18:11.720]  neuro linguistic programming that on people that are already in a trance
[18:11.720 --> 18:15.440]  completely see if you're not under a television induced trance that most
[18:15.440 --> 18:19.840]  people are now in a near sleep-like state this doesn't work on you but when
[18:19.840 --> 18:26.920]  you're in it it totally works these people aren't even conscious and the
[18:26.920 --> 18:31.520]  issue here is is that he's there meeting now privately last night with the
[18:31.520 --> 18:36.920]  families trying to gauge them and find out who they can use his poster pushers
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.760]  to take our guns and you've seen all the announcements of the executive power
[18:41.760 --> 18:46.040]  how they're going to use that to take our guns all of it so make no mistake the
[18:46.040 --> 18:51.480]  great war on the second amendment and on anybody who wants to be self-sufficient
[18:51.480 --> 18:58.480]  and doesn't want to be collectivized has begun I've got daily mail foreign
[18:58.480 --> 19:06.080]  affairs Washington Post you've seen it CNN CBS all saying preppers did this
[19:06.080 --> 19:12.080]  here's one of the headlines right here new town in the doomsday preppers
[19:12.080 --> 19:17.240]  foreign affairs a division of the Washington Post foreign policy.com I
[19:17.240 --> 19:26.520]  mean this is absolutely incredible that all of this is going on so they're

[19:46.400 --> 19:50.680]  you see the government has lost the trust of the people and they know that so
[19:50.680 --> 19:54.480]  they're basically saying anyone that doesn't trust us and doesn't want to be
[19:54.480 --> 19:58.160]  robbed by the government is a terrorist and I'm telling you they're getting

[20:20.720 --> 20:25.000]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.760]  that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and
[20:28.760 --> 20:32.640]  the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a

[24:23.160 --> 24:30.880]  all the same there'll be a golden letter reaching down you notice that this
[24:30.880 --> 24:36.280]  happened in a government training center in a model school of Homeland
[24:36.280 --> 24:40.240]  Security mass shooter drills where they teach everybody to lock down and get in
[24:40.240 --> 24:44.800]  fatal positions to be killed you notice the federal government has gotten laws
[24:44.800 --> 24:48.760]  passed so that you can't arm the teachers and others or even the
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.360]  principals to make sure that public schools are advertised as the place to
[24:53.360 --> 24:59.080]  go kill a bunch of people and then have the cops kill you it's like an option
[24:59.080 --> 25:03.720]  the media has hyped up school shootings the last 25 years so much that it
[25:03.720 --> 25:09.200]  becomes an option for crazy people and then the government who's running all
[25:09.200 --> 25:13.160]  these murderous operations worldwide gutting the economy putting sodium
[25:13.160 --> 25:17.640]  fluoride in the water admitted in Harvard studies they be giving tens of
[25:17.640 --> 25:23.240]  thousands bone cancer a year they can get up and cry and say they care about
[25:23.240 --> 25:29.120]  you more like crying with glee that he thinks he can dominate the American
[25:29.120 --> 25:33.200]  people these folks absolutely want to break this nation as the big prize
[25:33.200 --> 25:36.680]  they've already gotten almost all the guns everywhere else except Switzerland
[25:36.680 --> 25:41.160]  who by the way has the lowest crime rate in Europe and they get to script
[25:41.160 --> 25:45.840]  themselves as the saviors who try to keep us safe by taking our guns but we
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.080]  just won't let them this woman had to go get registered do background checks get
[25:50.080 --> 25:56.840]  thumbprints in Connecticut to own guns one of the most draconian gun law
[25:56.840 --> 26:02.520]  states in the United States it's number four approaching number three and
[26:02.520 --> 26:10.600]  notice that that's where it happens in the gun grabber haven that's where this
[26:10.600 --> 26:16.200]  goes on and so now they can turn the schools into little many prisons and
[26:16.200 --> 26:21.200]  frisk mommy and daddy when they come in and have people biometrically enter them
[26:21.200 --> 26:24.360]  it's all about a culture with the airports to train the adults how to be
[26:24.360 --> 26:29.520]  prisoners and how to be suspects people who aren't really criminals inducing you
[26:29.520 --> 26:33.360]  into the prison culture it's a conversion of our culture into a prison
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.960]  culture they try to get you in the system under welfare under criminal justice
[26:37.960 --> 26:42.400]  under so many different ways to get you to lose your rights and if they can't do
[26:42.400 --> 26:49.880]  that they'll train you in the public schools or they will train you via the
[26:49.880 --> 26:54.680]  TSA and that's what this is all about and we're gonna break it down today and
[26:54.680 --> 26:58.520]  play part of Obama's speech last night that when you know who this guy really
[26:58.520 --> 27:04.880]  is it's so disgusting I mean we've even got articles up at info wars calm where
[27:04.880 --> 27:11.280]  democratic party operatives are openly saying exploit the tragedy
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.280]  amazing this is how they operate they know exactly what they're doing there
[27:21.280 --> 27:25.200]  they're making statements on MSNBC like let's not like to let this capital go to
[27:25.200 --> 27:30.520]  waste these are people that are authoritarians these are not leftist and
[27:30.520 --> 27:34.680]  that's why you see Rupert Murdoch who claims he's a conservative saying time
[27:34.680 --> 27:40.200]  to ban all automatics which are already banned folks you can't go buy him he
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.720]  means semi-auto which is most guns that's why you're seeing Michael Moore
[27:44.720 --> 27:48.360]  that's why you're seeing all these people come out and say now is the time
[27:48.360 --> 27:53.120]  to take the guns so the great war on self-defense has begun I wrote some notes
[27:53.120 --> 27:59.640]  this morning on preppers on anybody who's not a collectivist this is the war
[27:59.640 --> 28:05.600]  on the individual I would like to point out when we come back from break and I'm
[28:05.600 --> 28:12.200]  gonna go over the full waterfront on this issue that Israel has m16s and
[28:12.200 --> 28:16.480]  handguns in all of their public schools in lockers for each of the teachers
[28:16.480 --> 28:22.840]  because in the last few decades they had a few cases of Palestinians getting in
[28:22.840 --> 28:28.440]  with firearms or knives and targeting them it all ended when they armed the
[28:28.440 --> 28:33.400]  schools but you notice that the Israel lobby Chuckie Schumer Diane Feinstein
[28:33.400 --> 28:42.400]  Rahm Emanuel the bloomberg you notice that the and that is a big part of the
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.320]  Israel lobby and I'm not against Israel particularly I don't like any of these
[28:47.320 --> 28:52.000]  corrupt governments the point is is that the Israel lobby knows to arm their
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.360]  people in Israel and this needs to be pointed out in defense of the Second
[28:57.360 --> 29:01.240]  Amendment you know we need to bring all this stuff up that it is an admitted
[29:01.240 --> 29:12.080]  dual citizenship crew of leftist the leftist wing in this country who are
[29:12.080 --> 29:16.880]  saying we should have our guns taken but have us taxpayers and that's who pays
[29:16.880 --> 29:22.600]  for these programs three plus billion dollars a year to arm the Israeli
[29:22.600 --> 29:26.480]  school teachers and principals and I say fine great I'm all for them having
[29:26.480 --> 29:34.200]  guns but don't then try to take my guns I mean we need to call the Israeli lobby
[29:34.200 --> 29:37.600]  who's a big part of the gun grabbing and I understand the US is paying the bill
[29:37.600 --> 29:41.480]  in Israel to a great extent and the left there wants to secure basically that
[29:41.480 --> 29:46.040]  paycheck by dominating our policy but listen to the Israeli leftist you're
[29:46.040 --> 29:50.360]  not getting our guns do you understand that you're not getting we're on the
[29:50.360 --> 29:58.480]  march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[34:29.960 --> 34:34.760]  children's brains not hurt them as was first believed that was a study paid for
[34:34.760 --> 34:39.560]  by Big Pharma you have to understand ladies and gentlemen there's another
[34:39.560 --> 34:44.600]  report out today an additional 24 studies show that even one part per million
[34:44.600 --> 34:49.200]  of sodium fluoride massively were to reduce his IQ and increases bone
[34:49.200 --> 34:54.040]  cancer sevenfold in men threefold in women you might want to go to info
[34:54.040 --> 34:58.200]  wars.com and I read there's two different articles on that I mean these
[34:58.200 --> 35:05.320]  are facts the people running things want to put a type of acid it's worse than
[35:05.320 --> 35:11.000]  sodium fluoride based off that in your water that they know brain damages you
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.320]  and that's why the general public can't fight back they are so brain damaged that
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.480]  they can't even think straight those of us that are able to think straight would
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.240]  have been genius level now we're just what normalcy used to be so they've
[35:23.240 --> 35:28.840]  lowered the bar and that's confirmed to 25 studies prove fluoride reduces your
[35:28.840 --> 35:34.720]  IQ I'm sorry I thought it was 24 and that's just one of the reports again
[35:34.720 --> 35:39.560]  ladies and gentlemen they're on the news saying mercury injected into your blood
[35:39.560 --> 35:43.560]  despite all the studies showing it causes massive brain damage injected
[35:43.560 --> 35:48.640]  right on the blood they're saying that we want mercury for kids these are the
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.240]  same pediatricians paid off by the globalists to say oh we think it's good
[35:52.240 --> 35:56.680]  that foster children 67 to 69% of them are on an average of seven
[35:56.680 --> 36:01.440]  psychotropics we think it's good thousands of foster kids die every year
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.720]  from psychotropic drug overdoses that's on record and pull those articles up if
[36:06.720 --> 36:12.120]  you'd like I mean they're so cold-blooded they're so evil they could care less
[36:12.120 --> 36:16.680]  about you the worst of the worst this is a federal government since the 1940s
[36:16.680 --> 36:21.240]  through the 90s the last time stuff got declassified under US code title 50
[36:21.240 --> 36:28.760]  chapter 32 subsection 1528 paragraph B states they can do lethal testing on you
[36:28.760 --> 36:36.680]  for any law enforcement or research reason they say in law they can kill you
[36:36.680 --> 36:40.800]  and they do they kill our troops they kill foster children even New York daily
[36:40.800 --> 36:44.200]  news reported on them grabbing little black kids in New York and testing
[36:44.200 --> 36:49.000]  pesticides on them till they die and how the foster workers got upset because the
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.400]  little kids were begging one little seven-year-old would beg every day as they
[36:52.400 --> 36:58.960]  you know gave them the pesticide and then they until he died they murder
[36:58.960 --> 37:05.080]  children strapped down to gurneys right now they call it research they have CIA
[37:05.080 --> 37:08.880]  bases where they rape people's children in front of them on record armies on

[37:36.280 --> 37:40.960]  secretly disappear you and arrest you and kill you if they want while they run
[37:40.960 --> 37:44.960]  torture camps all over the world that's continuing and expanding and people are

[37:57.960 --> 38:02.640]  innocents collateral damage if it kills one person they'll go to a wedding or a
[38:02.640 --> 38:06.640]  birthday party or a meeting or bomb a whole apartment building and kill
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.120]  everybody to kill one guy they say is a terrorist while they publicly run the
[38:10.120 --> 38:16.040]  real Al Qaeda in Libya Syria and other countries I mean it's a joke ladies and
[38:16.040 --> 38:21.120]  gentlemen they've given over 10,000 missiles to Al Qaeda that can shoot down
[38:21.120 --> 38:27.160]  our aircraft mainstream news oh but he's so sad for the children in the victim
[38:27.160 --> 38:30.880]  disarmament state in a victim disarmament center in Connecticut and now

[38:34.840 --> 38:40.840]  children it tears our guts out they are totally and completely manipulating us
[38:40.840 --> 38:48.040]  so let's let's just go over some of the headlines right here did paranoia gun
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.280]  craze mother trigger son's killing spree friends say she believed the world was
[38:52.280 --> 38:57.760]  on the edge of collapse she was a prepper 2012 and God forbid there be a
[38:57.760 --> 39:01.960]  bunch of craziness with 2012 coming up Friday obviously it's not gonna be the
[39:01.960 --> 39:07.120]  end of the world but might be some crazies going nuts look at that article
[39:07.120 --> 39:11.160]  here's another one war on preppers new scapegoat for the school massacre
[39:11.160 --> 39:15.240]  collectivists exploit mass shooting to demonize their political adversaries
[39:15.240 --> 39:19.840]  Paul Watson and Alex Jones at info wars.com very important article look
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.880]  at this armed SWAT teams to patrol streets in Arkansas City this is
[39:23.880 --> 39:27.400]  happening all over the country they're announcing daytime nighttime curfews and
[39:27.400 --> 39:32.680]  setting up checkpoints where they come up and aim guns at you government can't
[39:32.680 --> 39:37.320]  and won't protect you they've lost their credibility now they're trying to get it
[39:37.320 --> 39:42.160]  back by grandstanding here it is new town in the doomsday preppers foreign
[39:42.160 --> 39:47.320]  policy put out by the Washington Post oh my gosh it's the doomsday preppers and
[39:47.320 --> 39:54.280]  and and who are the preppers who are the preppers the preppers are people that
[39:54.280 --> 39:58.320]  don't trust the government because of Katrina and Sandy and all the other
[39:58.320 --> 40:02.400]  examples and people that are informed and people that don't want to be
[40:02.400 --> 40:05.600]  collectivist who don't want to go to the Superdome and get gang raped during
[40:05.600 --> 40:11.360]  the crisis we're the people who obviously aren't programmed so they say
[40:11.360 --> 40:15.160]  it's returning veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians preppers
[40:15.160 --> 40:19.560]  survivalist that's who the police are taught all day they're gonna have a war
[40:19.560 --> 40:27.080]  with and then right out of central casting remember what all the White House
[40:27.080 --> 40:33.840]  advisors said democratic operatives urged Obama to seize on attacks exploiting
[40:33.840 --> 40:40.160]  bloodshed to reconnect with the American people that was July 24th 2012 and it
[40:40.160 --> 40:44.200]  breaks down all these advisors saying we need big mass attacks we need dead
[40:44.200 --> 40:51.680]  people and when I said like a dead child like an Oklahoma City that image and we
[40:51.680 --> 40:55.600]  said get ready for mass shootings and bombings of federal buildings they will
[40:55.600 --> 40:59.680]  stage or they'll find mentally ill people and give them the weapons even
[40:59.680 --> 41:05.040]  mainstream news reported on that to have them carry out the attacks okay
[41:05.040 --> 41:11.520]  continuing here I want to go over Obama's speech Ventura is coming up but
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.080]  I've got to start getting to some of this Obama talks about love all you need is
[41:17.080 --> 41:23.840]  love all you need what did John Lennon say about the globalist he said they're
[41:23.840 --> 41:29.120]  Illuminati devil worshippers before he was killed wrote songs on that look it
[41:29.120 --> 41:32.760]  up and he said there's the world's not overpopulated and the world's run by
[41:32.760 --> 41:39.280]  people that want to depopulate pretty smart guy he knows what's going on knew
[41:39.280 --> 41:46.160]  what was going on oh Obama all you need is love grandstanding there sucking on
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.080]  those people while he's got drones killing kids stuff so horrible I can't
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.160]  even show it arms legs blown off but it's a peace prize it's a liberal doing
[41:55.160 --> 41:58.840]  it I mean stuff with the lower manable blown off with the tongue and blood
[41:58.840 --> 42:03.640]  spewing out a little girl screaming and then dying video video video video video
[42:03.640 --> 42:10.960]  video object but it's peace bombing it's peace bombing so remember the
[42:10.960 --> 42:15.760]  government can't and won't take care of you and so the public's waking up
[42:15.760 --> 42:20.800]  Congress has a 9% approval rating on average the system is panicking it's
[42:20.800 --> 42:24.560]  run by foreign banks that have looted Europe and are now looting us engaged in
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.720]  all sorts of crime in front of us arming to the teeth against us with armored
[42:28.720 --> 42:34.600]  vehicles and tanks being cashed in every town and city martial law being
[42:34.600 --> 42:40.560]  incrementally turned on TSA on the streets all of this being done in the
[42:40.560 --> 42:43.520]  name of al-qaeda then they flip the script and say no no no it's for preppers
[42:43.520 --> 42:48.400]  it's for conservatives now the rollout starts and they create the simulation 20
[42:48.400 --> 42:52.760]  dead kids from some person under psychiatric care undoubtedly on drugs
[42:52.760 --> 43:00.200]  video game head suicide now the number one cause of death in the United States I
[43:00.200 --> 43:04.160]  really think it's hospitals but they say showed ABC News your shit why is the
[43:04.160 --> 43:07.720]  record suicide because we're record numbers of taking drugs that the insert
[43:07.720 --> 43:16.240]  says a 2,400% increase in suicide depending on the drug because folks if
[43:16.240 --> 43:19.880]  you're on these drugs and you have the compulsion to commit suicide and you'll
[43:19.880 --> 43:24.840]  do it it takes away the compulsion not just in humans but in prairie dogs and
[43:24.840 --> 43:28.760]  in shrimp they've done studies prairie dogs will walk right up to a wolf be
[43:28.760 --> 43:34.400]  eating shrimp will swim right up to a fish pull up the studies it takes away
[43:34.400 --> 43:40.720]  inhibition it turns women into nymphomaniacs
[43:42.200 --> 43:49.440]  suicides replace auto crashes is top cause of injury death ABC News injury
[43:49.440 --> 43:56.000]  death means unnatural causes okay let's continue no amount of control can make
[43:56.000 --> 44:01.440]  you safe no amount of highway checkpoints TSA checkpoints no amount of
[44:01.440 --> 44:03.640]  that plus they don't want to make you safe they're the ones with the
[44:03.640 --> 44:07.720]  underwear bomber on the plane again the system needs to be relevant it needs to
[44:07.720 --> 44:11.920]  be able to grandstand and make you watch it the mainstream media needs this
[44:11.920 --> 44:15.480]  because no one watches them unless there's a big mass shooting and then
[44:15.480 --> 44:20.080]  Obama whose normal White House videos get about 10,000 views you go to White
[44:20.080 --> 44:27.200]  House official channel on YouTube gets about 10,000 views his videos oh he gets
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.560]  to have four or five million now on his videos when this happens see that's why
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.960]  his advisors said we need big crises mass shootings bombings so you can be
[44:36.960 --> 44:42.600]  relevant that's their quote so again I want to say this clearly the
[44:42.600 --> 44:46.800]  establishment America has woken up and does not trust you and knows who you
[44:46.800 --> 44:51.480]  are sure you got a sports fan mentality group that thinks you know Obama won beat
[44:51.480 --> 44:55.280]  Romney while their winners they don't know the whole thing was rigged man you're
[44:55.280 --> 44:58.920]  you're gonna get your collectivism you associate your personal power with the
[44:58.920 --> 45:03.640]  government that's probably 25% of the public half the public voted half of
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.000]  them voted for Obama clearly election fraud as well but it didn't matter the
[45:07.000 --> 45:12.560]  fix was him and Romney so all of this is going on all of this is happening we
[45:12.560 --> 45:18.280]  don't trust you we know you're bad all the polls all the statistics show that
[45:18.280 --> 45:22.480]  and so people know the banks are engineering us for collapse they know
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.320]  the government's building underground bases and getting caches of food and
[45:25.320 --> 45:29.960]  weapons so and when we knew Obama was coming after our guns when Sarah Brady
[45:29.960 --> 45:34.480]  Bragg don't worry in a second term he's gonna ban him we knew this was coming
[45:34.480 --> 45:38.720]  and you know my gut tells me because of what we know about other shooters and
[45:38.720 --> 45:42.720]  that being swept under the rug and report of a guy in a mask and then reports of
[45:42.720 --> 45:47.840]  other shooters and then who this guy's dad was high level GE exec and we're
[45:47.840 --> 45:53.240]  getting some intel right now it looks bad they probably had some globalist
[45:53.240 --> 45:58.360]  grease mommy get him wound up drugged out get him in there shoot him because
[45:58.360 --> 46:02.480]  this has been done before then have your real group that did it exit but even if
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.560]  that's not the case it's cultural mind control the television the shooter
[46:06.560 --> 46:10.320]  video games designed by the Pentagon to make you kill instinctively and
[46:10.320 --> 46:15.240]  uncaringly in a program trained fashion he was clearly under psychiatric care
[46:15.240 --> 46:19.440]  that's now confirmed there they're not releasing his file guaranteed he was on
[46:19.440 --> 46:26.560]  drugs just like Sergeant Bales killed 16 people turns out he was on malaria
[46:26.560 --> 46:30.880]  drugs steroids and an unnamed psychotropic now we learn from the
[46:30.880 --> 46:36.760]  trial of course I mean you don't just climb over the base wall and go in in
[46:36.760 --> 46:41.840]  some night care and and and kill and then burn the bodies of 16 men women and
[46:41.840 --> 46:45.960]  children the guy was full-on hallucinating but they can't blame the
[46:45.960 --> 46:52.480]  drugs show they're gonna send that guy to prison a guy who had his foot blown off
[46:52.480 --> 46:57.320]  and had a prosthesis and begged not to go back and was in psychiatric care and
[46:57.320 --> 47:03.040]  who was arrested blowing up in the you know what was it Oregon and they put him
[47:03.040 --> 47:06.360]  on a plane and said you're gonna go back and command people and then an armored
[47:06.360 --> 47:10.960]  vehicle got blown up with a bunch of his friends on it that day and he was on a
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.480]  hallucinogenic malaria drug they've had to pull steroids and a psychotropic
[47:15.480 --> 47:24.080]  holy Toledo oh but you got a dig to find that you got a dig dig dig dig dig
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.960]  dig dig dig why are we having a seven-fold increase versus the worst
[47:29.960 --> 47:33.520]  numbers previously in Vietnam of suicides gee you make people do four
[47:33.520 --> 47:39.800]  five six seven tours and you put them on psychotropic when they want out they're
[47:39.800 --> 47:44.320]  gonna kill themselves their men trained with firearms their can their control
[47:44.320 --> 47:48.160]  their governor's been removed their wife's leaving them their bills are
[47:48.160 --> 47:55.640]  stacking up their foot's blown off the guy half his foot was a prosthesis
[47:55.640 --> 48:00.560]  they've got guys serving their fourth tour who should probably be in a mental
[48:00.560 --> 48:04.320]  institution with part of their foot blown off the whole front of his foot
[48:04.320 --> 48:10.600]  blown off begging not to go back and they sending again you're gonna hear
[48:10.600 --> 48:15.000]  nothing about drugs you're gonna hear nothing about drugs that on the insert
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.720]  says makes you engage in mass murder mania psychosis increased suicide and
[48:19.720 --> 48:25.800]  they knew it in 1980 with the first trials of the first SSRIs and SRIs I
[48:25.800 --> 48:31.000]  mean my goodness put the military on suicide bills they're gonna start
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  committing suicide but the American people 20% of us now on it put the
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.640]  American people on suicide bills wow suicides basically doubled the last two
[48:40.640 --> 48:46.160]  decades look it up wow you give people suicide pills they commit suicide you put
[48:46.160 --> 48:52.400]  some autistic idiot savant video game heads spoiled brat on suicide pills
[48:52.400 --> 48:57.480]  mass murder pills oh but there's no discussion it's how the NRAs to blame
[48:57.480 --> 49:02.400]  and they're gonna have marches on the NRA and how I'm to blame you ought to go
[49:02.400 --> 49:05.840]  read these comments on info wars comm and on the YouTube and the and the
[49:05.840 --> 49:10.600]  Twitter and stuff it's how I need to be killed and these weirdos talk about how
[49:10.600 --> 49:15.520]  they're gonna shoot me see it's all tribalism demonize the Second Amendment

[49:33.320 --> 49:36.760]  against the guns now this is this gives them cover because they're bought and
[49:36.760 --> 49:40.240]  paid for by the same people you're going to see the Democrats coming that
[49:40.240 --> 49:46.120]  they're here they're saying ban them all ban everything it's on and remember
[49:46.120 --> 49:51.520]  Hollywood that puts out senseless mass of violence and Jamie Foxx saying who I

[50:10.000 --> 50:13.240]  they've all got armed bodyguards protecting them while they push a total
[50:13.240 --> 50:19.560]  culture of death on us milking it for every drop they can get and Obama going
[50:19.560 --> 50:23.480]  and meeting with the families trying to get them on board to come out against the
[50:23.480 --> 50:28.840]  Second Amendment and they're coming and he says I'll use executive power to do
[50:28.840 --> 50:32.920]  it and then they will start arresting citizens saying we're terrorist and
[50:32.920 --> 50:36.480]  weren't planning to turn our guns in they want a war with the American people

[55:44.040 --> 55:48.040]  they're coming for our guns and they're not just talking about banning the
[55:48.040 --> 55:52.440]  sale or manufacture they say you're going to turn them in

[56:10.760 --> 56:14.280]  it let's expand on this this is the government wanting our guns
[56:14.280 --> 56:18.840]  while it's getting tanks and billions of bullets for war with us
[56:18.840 --> 56:22.920]  oh gee have i heard of this before and remember the globalists are all going to
[56:22.920 --> 56:26.200]  go to jail if they don't go to authoritarianism
[56:26.200 --> 56:29.240]  because they have a nine percent approval rating people now know about
[56:29.240 --> 56:32.600]  what's going on the vast majority of people are waking up
[56:32.600 --> 56:35.960]  the globalists have committed all these crimes international security

[56:43.320 --> 56:47.160]  intellectually but also in my gut being on more on the edge of my seat
[56:47.160 --> 56:51.080]  okay they're coming they're coming they're coming

[57:40.440 --> 57:43.720]  and to get everybody in line they're following a blueprint

[57:47.480 --> 57:50.600]  and have gotten food water firearms and friends
[57:50.600 --> 57:54.680]  and that we're ready we're the people that know what's going on

[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.000]  absolutely clear the type of pure evil we've got the election was a fraud
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.480]  romney was a fraud it was a fraud at every level obama didn't really win

[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.800]  a criminal establishment that is testing to see
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.560]  right now and they've got republicans lining up to physically
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.320]  ban handguns and rifles we're going to get jessie ventura on for two segments
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.920]  then we're going to open your phones up are you going to turn your guns in
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.600]  police out there you know what do you think about this you
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:45.480]  you have these shootings in gun control zones like connecticut
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.400]  twice the number of people die every year from
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.160]  automobile accidents with deer then die and quote mass shootings at most that
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.120]  88 number of mass shootings is gang related
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.000]  and i'm not saying those shootings don't matter but it's groups of people
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.760]  killing each other over drug turf not little kids
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.440]  this thing has siop written all over at the timing all the rest of it but all i
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.680]  know is they're siopping with it they're not letting a good crisis go to waste
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:18.120]  and katie katie bar the door is all i can say
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.080]  because the great war against the second amendment
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.600]  is on and they're going to try to take all of our guns
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.240]  and put us on no gun by list without judge or jury that's all being announced
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.960]  in fact will you guys queue up rama manual for later
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:36.200]  after i get to the obama speech rama manual says
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:41.160]  uh take people's guns or on no fly list which is a no gun by list
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.680]  there's rama manual on no gun by list middle to flip we played probably a
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.080]  hundred times it's probably in our archive
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.360]  uh but that's all coming up after jessie ventura joins us
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.960]  and we will take your calls i'll give the number out before he leaves us
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.080]  uh but uh we'll have open phones in the
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:03.720]  in the end of this hour in the third hour today but
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.400]  they're coming for everything smart meters spying on everything we do nsa
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.400]  spying on us drones checkpoints on the highways
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:17.560]  gunbands of almost all firearms secret arrest of citizens and all of it with a
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.600]  bunch of fake crying from obama so fake it makes me want to
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.280]  throw up and going in grandstanding off of all this but it doesn't
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.560]  matter you've lost the trust of the american people
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.760]  those that can think those that can tie their shoelaces

[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.040]  pretty powerful information and i couldn't give a better time to discuss
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.080]  this our listeners are chomping at the bit with the police reports of
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.520]  multiple shooters and his dad being a high-level
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.360]  banking executive with general electric in their banking division
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.360]  and the mother having shadowy ties and you know multi-millionaires
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.760]  and the reports that this was a gun you know free controlled zone
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.000]  all i know is they're seizing on it to go after our second amendment so jesse
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.200]  ventura former minnesota governor best-selling author
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.520]  a host of conspiracy theory he joins us he was on with this last week saying
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.200]  yeah they're coming after our guns that was a quote by governor ventura
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.320]  because i know that's what we gave the video headline on youtube
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.840]  uh... democrats are coming after our guns as he said that they come after
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.960]  that side of our freedom and i don't know his take
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:29.240]  in fact i was asking during the break he said let me just say it fresh on air
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.680]  because this is governor ventura's first time since the shooting on friday
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.680]  to be on the air so here is the exclusive because i want to hear your
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:40.680]  take governor thanks for coming on great to be here alex let me let me start off
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:46.040]  by saying this the media coverage of this event
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.760]  was the worst i've ever seen in my lifetime
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:55.560]  because we were pumped out so much information early on
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.800]  that all these media outlets sold to us
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.800]  and then a half a day later after telling us 30 times
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.920]  we find out it's not true and i think someone needs to hold the media
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.400]  accountable for when a tragedy like this occurs
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.560]  that they quit looking for ratings points and they wait
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.080]  until they get official word and official
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:28.600]  uh... what went on who is who until they talk to the authorities
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:35.160]  and i was so confused by 12 hours later that i don't know what to believe
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:40.680]  anymore because i was fed so much false information initially
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:44.760]  did you follow that alex but they told us it was lee harvey oswald acting alone
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.440]  i'm sure there's nothing going on here well not just that but we were first
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:53.800]  told that the perpetrators mom worked at the school
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:58.920]  we were told that for a half a day yes and it turns out she had no connection
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.600]  to the school whatsoever we were told two wrong names and i reported it because
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.640]  they were saying it two wrong names of people that
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.960]  didn't do it exactly they first said it was his brother
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:15.000]  because they said it was ryan who had done all this for six to eight hours
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.160]  and then all of a sudden it changed and that's one of the things i have a
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:23.080]  great concern over besides the tragedy itself
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:27.240]  is the fact that our news media did not care
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.560]  whether they were reporting factor fiction you could clearly see they were
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.480]  like sharks in the bleeding water wanting to
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:41.000]  trump any other media with any type of thing they were told because clearly
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.200]  they were they were pumping out information that had not been
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:49.000]  substantiated in any way shape or form
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.080]  and it makes it so confusing that when the truth if the truth does come out
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.360]  how are you going to know what you can believe and what you can't believe when
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.680]  you've been fed so much false information right out of the get go
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.480]  now having said that let's move forward to the gun control
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.840]  okay now they're going to i said something when i was in office that i'd
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.520]  like to change a little bit i made a famous quote that you
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:22.040]  can't legislate stupidity well i'd like to change that quote
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.360]  to you can't legislate stupidity or insanity
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.280]  there's nothing you can do there's no large you can pass
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:36.280]  that can control those things it's all part of living in a free society now
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:41.800]  if the government wants to come down with this massive gun control on us
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:46.200]  i think that they should have to first set the example themselves
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:52.200]  and that is we are without a doubt the largest arms sales country in the world
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:58.360]  we sell arms to everybody how many all those arms we sell what is the fatality
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.360]  rate in the end all this third world weapons that we send
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.960]  throughout the world millions from the united states
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.560]  how many people die because of that so if the government wants to impose gun
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:15.560]  control on us they should start with themselves
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:20.120]  they should lead by example they should truly turn the united states into the
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.280]  peace nation and stop this massive building of
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.680]  armaments that we propel throughout the world on a daily basis
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.480]  well said governor ventura let me get your take on this
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:35.320]  obama has launched drone strikes now in eight countries but he's a peace prize
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.760]  winner so it's okay now they admit even the la times the
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.320]  new york times admits our government's funding al-qaeda
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:48.120]  to attack syria and then he goes and uh looked like he was fake crying to me
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.600]  the point is well the point is it ain't even him
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:58.280]  we have the same thing under george bush that's the point alex
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.360]  the president's just a figurehead in my opinion
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.000]  nothing more and and because we had all these
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.480]  like i laugh on this big investigation now illibia right
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.640]  they're investigating because they initially made the wrong statement
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:21.000]  on what the attack was about so now the teams out there demanding this big
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.840]  congressional investigation over over the tragedy
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.400]  shooting in libya those four people died where was john mccain
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.280]  and where were all these elected politicians
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:37.480]  after the trump up phony information we got on iraq
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:41.960]  all the lies we were told that were turned out to be lies weapons of mass
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.520]  destruction ties to al-qaeda the murder the murder of
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:51.320]  al-fahab the football player pat tulman the rescue address at the lynch
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.200]  all yellow cake aluminum tubes the outrage on that alex where's the
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:00.600]  congressional investigation on the trumped up intelligence that we were
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.160]  fed the lies we were fed when we were put into the iraq war i totally agree
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.040]  with you i thought that from these politicians
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.320]  well i totally agree with you but getting back to the shooting though you
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:14.840]  know you've been a governor uh we've seen these calls to disarm
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.400]  nfl football players it gets more and more
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.680]  ridiculous how do i lose my rights because somebody else does something
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.680]  wrong that sounds like an authoritarian country alex
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.240]  they said that with this event now it's time to do something correct
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.480]  yes we're all hearing this is the final straw the straw is broken it's time to
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.560]  do something i told them after columbine when i first became
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.360]  governor i told them what needed to be done no one would listen to me and you
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:49.080]  know what that was tell us we have hundreds and thousands of well
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.200]  qualified military and police personnel out there that are retired
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:59.480]  qualified people train these people put them in the schools and you do it in a
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:05.320]  covering manner you hire them as bob the janitor the kids don't need to know
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.400]  but that janitor carries a weapon at all times concealed
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.560]  one or two i don't care how many you need three or four whatever it takes
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:18.200]  and they work as janitors in the school while still providing security
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:23.480]  when you look if i'm a bad guy today the first place i'm going to look to
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.880]  wreak havoc is to go to somewhere where i know i can get away with it
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.800]  yeah they advertise the public schools and they teach the kids to huddle in a
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.360]  ball so it's easier to shoot them it isn't just that they advertise that
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.680]  there's no protection we have that problem here in minnesota
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:48.440]  we passed it conceal and carry and but yet stores put up signs stating no guns
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:53.080]  allowed in here well that's great whatever i do into those places i always
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:57.320]  turn to the person and i say do you realize how stupid that sign is
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:02.520]  for two reasons number one it lets any perpetrator know there's no
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.520]  there's nobody in here that can harm them and number two
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:11.880]  it takes a lab biting citizen and separates them from their weapon
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.800]  that's the worst thing you can do in other words if i pull up and i'm a
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.920]  conceal and carry let's say hypothetically and i'm
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.320]  armed and i see the sign in the store no guns allowed in here
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:27.320]  well then i'm expected to what leave that weapon in the car
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.080]  separate myself from it and go into the store
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:35.480]  in the meantime someone could break into my car they're obviously a criminal to
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:39.480]  begin with if they break into a car and now they're armed with a weapon
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:43.640]  that's right and so separating it's like it's like
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.840]  what i was told with my protection bag they said don't ever separate from your
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:52.040]  protection bag don't send your protection bag
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:57.560]  in to clear the house because then if the perpetrators outside
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:02.600]  you've separated yourself from your protection you keep the dog with you at
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.760]  times you know i i remember now after calling
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:10.280]  by seeing you on the news saying that i probably subconsciously was just thinking
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.280]  about what you had said but i said on my sunday show yesterday
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:18.120]  the answer is because the feds say no guns in schools well they can't stop the
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.560]  sheriff's department sheriffs can deputize
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:26.760]  retired police officers i mean because we trust them to be have guns as cops
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.240]  and then you can have them uh where they work a few days a week you'll have
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.400]  tons in every town that want to volunteer they're like the old guys you see
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.000]  who volunteer to be crosswalkers for the kids
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:44.200]  i got a better idea let's let's bring our men and women home and end these
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:49.000]  wars and we'll have enough money where we won't need volunteers
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.240]  no i agree with you i'm just saying let's start taking care of our country
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.840]  obviously we have major problems right here at home
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.160]  it's time for the united states of america to pay attention to its own
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:06.840]  backyard instead of worrying about all the yards throughout this world
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.720]  i agree with you i'm just saying we've got a they're going to say hand in all
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.600]  semi-autos handguns and rifles they're now announcing
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.640]  they want to physically take them governor they're now announcing they're
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.680]  just going to put you on a no gun buy list and then make you turn them in no
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.800]  judge your jury uh what is your take on these announcements
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.080]  being made by these senators and others that have their own bodyguards
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.000]  well of course they're blowing smoke right now and they're talking to me
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.240]  if it's a politician saying it rest assured he's saying it to secure his
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.520]  re-election because that's the only thing that the
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.840]  dems and republics care about is getting re-elected maintaining their
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:46.200]  power their two-party dictatorship but the point of the matter is as i stated
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.280]  earlier alex if they're going to impose any type of gun control on us the
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:55.080]  citizens then they need to impose it upon themselves first they need to set by
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:59.640]  example i'm after living in a peace world
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.640]  you know but until they can convince me i also stand
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.480]  and all this garbage they tell you about the second amendment won't affect
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:12.200]  your hunting and fishing and all that nonsense it wasn't written for that
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.480]  people never bring up the true reason it was written
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.240]  it was written so that we the citizens would have a way to defend
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.720]  ourselves if our government became abusive well sure you stay down in
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:26.920]  mexico four or five months out of the year and i know you've spoken to the
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.440]  fact that they have a total gunman for the citizens down there
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:34.040]  and a violent crime rate what four times what the united states is
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:38.680]  almost 55 000 people dead but in the last three four years governor
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:45.000]  yeah exactly in mexico there's big signs when you cross the border
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.080]  you can't even bring bullets in there
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:54.280]  it did the controls beyond and they have checkpoints when i drive down the
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:58.040]  bottom i have to go through six army checkpoints
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.640]  and that's what they're checking for weapons
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:07.560]  and and yet the violence in mexico in many places not all of mexico don't get
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.640]  me wrong i don't want to throw a blanket the country's beautiful it's a
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:16.120]  wonderful but the drug corridors wonderful people but the violence in
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.960]  places in mexico is just out of control
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:24.600]  and there's a country that practices gun control to the extreme
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.720]  and so you clearly see it does not work well governor our last issue of the
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:34.120]  magazine on the cover uh says this man wants your guns and it's an
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.360]  image of obama on the cover and we said this came out three three weeks ago
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.680]  we said they will introduce the legislation and we show their quotes
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.520]  where i understand i hope it's smoke but i i've got to give you the bad news
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.240]  they are claiming and i've got the quotes in the magazine
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:53.960]  that they are going to try to physically ban semi-auto handguns and rifles
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:58.040]  and make them be turned in a what is your take on that and b
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.560]  i believe it's going to cause a civil war if they try it first of all there
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.040]  have no right to take my private property i realize that the supreme court
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:11.480]  has given them that right in many cases but uh you know if if someone owns
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:15.000]  something the government does not have the right to come in and take that from
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.040]  you that's your private property and it's probably on your private property
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.960]  and if people say for this and people accept
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.960]  you know i've always laughingly said when i have a gun safe
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:35.080]  that i've come i've never come home and heard my guns going off in the safe
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:40.280]  don't people let's put it in this context alex drunk how many people
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:44.360]  drive of drunk driving every year thousands
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:48.200]  let's see about 30 000 okay that's huge
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.800]  that's probably more people die of that than they do guns i don't know i
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.080]  haven't seen the statistic well that's auto accidents overall but about
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.280]  half of them well the fatalities are usually connected to some type of
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:02.680]  drug right well okay now are we going to hold forward motor
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:07.400]  company responsible because some idiot out there decides to drink and drive and
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.080]  kill someone because they misuse that two ton
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:14.360]  projector that can go a hundred miles an hour
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.520]  and is technically more lethal than any gun
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.680]  now you don't hear them going after the car companies you don't hear them saying
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.000]  we're going to ban automotives automotives because they're misused
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.160]  at times which they are now granted they're trying to do
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:35.000]  things to eliminate drunk driving and kudos for doing that but
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.680]  ultimately what does it all come down to alex it comes down to us as
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.680]  individuals we have to make those decisions and
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:48.280]  we bear complete responsibility for them if you choose to use a gun wrong
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.440]  you're the one that said not the gun if you drive a car
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:57.560]  and you get drunk and try it and kill somebody on a street corner because
[01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.720]  you're so blitzed and inebriated it isn't the car's fault
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.280]  it's the person driving the car i agree let me raise this point with you
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.400]  it's been said by many that blaming guns for
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.960]  shootings is like blaming spoons for people being fat
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.600]  or did we ban dog ownership because michael vick was fighting dogs
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.360]  i mean that's that's this line of reasoning and the states that have more
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.800]  gun control have higher crime rates because the criminals know they're
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.840]  safe but let me give you the statistic it's abc news can you
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.920]  guys pull it back up uh last year and this year we cross the rubicon
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.960]  now the number one cause of death is not automobile accident
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:41.000]  it's now suicide they put our troops on psychotropic known to cause suicide the
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.320]  insert admits it there's abc headline suicide replaces auto crashes to stop
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.880]  cause of death and expanding now we wonder why
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:53.240]  so many of these mass shooters are on the psychotropic
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.480]  that will make you a psychotic killer a percentage of the time
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.680]  so why aren't we hearing anything about how dangerous
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.320]  prozac and other drugs like this are well because naturally they're sold by the
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.320]  big pharmaceutical companies who are making huge profits
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.720]  uh can you imagine the headlines if they could prove that this kid was on pot
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.560]  when he did it oh my gosh you know that's all you do then
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.320]  but you had a fist kid was taking some type of pills from the pharmacy to
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:26.280]  control his psychotic behavior well it's never the pills that is it
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.320]  no it's never the pills fault and they admitted he was under psychiatric care
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.320]  but they won't when they drug everybody now here we go
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:38.200]  and i know i'm sounded repetitious alex but if we weren't involved in these
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.800]  lawyers all the money we would have for healthcare
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.080]  and healthcare also includes psychiatric care
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.680]  because the only way you're going to stop this type of behavior you have to
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.160]  get to the root of the problem and the root of the problem is not guns
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.880]  well now they say his mother was a prepper and so it's the fault of anybody
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.960]  that's prepared since when is being prepared bad look at sandy
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.960]  i mean a month later power was off in some areas look at katrina
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.240]  i mean governor can government take care of us
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:15.000]  no well they can if they lock us up that's what people remember what
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.840]  benjamin franklin said those that will give up their
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:23.560]  liberties for security shall have and deserve neither
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:26.840]  the only way government can protect you in this life
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:34.120]  is to imprison you take away your freedoms and put us under martial law
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:37.480]  now and you i know you said my quote at the beginning
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.000]  i personally love my freedoms too much and i put up with the
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.680]  i put up with the with the fact that yes you know bad things happen
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.520]  and the horrible things i don't wish them on anyone i wish we could live in a
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.840]  world that bad things didn't happen but unfortunately they do
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.960]  but i still will not give up my freedom to somehow it's like the cartoon i saw
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.520]  where it's the mother and the father and the two
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:06.680]  children sitting at the dinner table and they're all exclaiming at the same
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.200]  time boy i feel safe now and then you look at
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:13.000]  the cartoon and they're all inside a barred cell
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.280]  well that's a quote from 1958 from eisenhower he said
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:22.600]  secure he said security i can give you security at columbia university
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:27.240]  that's pull up eisenhower quote real quick on on security and safety
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.640]  he said i can put you in a prison but we all know that prisons aren't safe
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.360]  places to be any government claiming i'm going to take
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.840]  your rights to keep you safe look out exactly because freedom is security
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.880]  people need to understand that you you you don't live if you don't live under
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.200]  freedom then you're not secure at all because that means
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:56.280]  and i this this idea that that we should all rely on our government to do
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:00.120]  everything for us is just ridiculous it's just like i was talking to one of
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:04.280]  my uh former bodyguards a state trooper with
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:08.040]  with the minnesota who's still bodyguiding the current governor governor
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.320]  datan then he's a father his father was just saying
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.920]  our police officers for life and like he told me
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:20.040]  unequivocally he said cops don't stop crimes we investigate them
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.520]  that's right you know we don't have to be unless it's done luck if you go up
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.800]  to any police officer ask them if you get into
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:31.720]  conversation with them how many actual crimes have you stopped in
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.480]  progress and maybe you'll run into one or two that have
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.640]  and then ask them how did you do it most of them will tell you it was done
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:43.000]  luck i happened to turn left and saw the guy running out of the store with the
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.560]  tv set well i was about to say i mean i've lived in big
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.080]  cities and been all over and i've only seen crimes being committed a few times
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:53.240]  we all drive around just like cops how many crimes do we see being committed
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.720]  yeah i on a regular basis i'm lucky if i see one a year
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:02.280]  maybe i can't even think of a crime that i've seen
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.480]  and on the top of my head right now hey listen i'm not going to twist your arm
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.800]  but we got to do like 10 more minutes on the other side because this is one of
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.600]  our last interviews probably with you this year before you go back down to
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.440]  mexico we got to come back and briefly talk about
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.040]  the tv show and also any other issues in fact we're going to break
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:20.760]  right now but again 10 o'clock central tonight
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.560]  when we come back with governor ventura we'll talk about the tv show that deals
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.160]  with mind control briefly and then he is off into the sunset
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.360]  until he returns back after the hard minnesota winter
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:34.120]  from bahama mexico which i could be down there broadcasting
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.480]  so we'll be right back with former minnesota governor jesse ventura
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.280]  for just a few minutes after this quick break and then we'll go to your phone
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.400]  calls and obama's speech last night where he said
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:47.880]  they're coming after our second amendment because some prozac head went
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:53.880]  haywire stay with us we're on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:30:00.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:22.200]  thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:26.200]  all right this is going to be our last little visit uh while he goes away for
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.240]  the winter but i was talking to jesse we may be able to twist his arm
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.520]  into one more little visit next week but we'll see he's got a lot of get a lot
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:36.360]  to get done uh winterizing things before he goes to mexico obviously
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.560]  folks there is so much to talk about i'm going to give the number out after the
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.040]  governor leaves us here in six or seven minutes
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.040]  i'm going to get into the other news but it is so opportunistic from my
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.600]  perspective i don't want to get to the tv show briefly
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.520]  to know that obama because it's bad enough when bush is warmongering
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:56.920]  you know i was a huge critic of bush i'm more of a libertarian so i tend to
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:00.280]  lean towards the rhetoric of the republicans but like governor ventura
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.800]  says they're all part of the same globalist club it's all going the same
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:06.920]  direction it's like rearranging deck chairs on the titanic
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:10.600]  but with the democrats calling themselves peaceniks
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:14.680]  calling themselves liberal uh thomas jefferson was a liberal
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.840]  uh obama the puppet is no liberal i mean i would think of myself really as a
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.960]  liberal i mean i want more freedom that means individual freedom
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.840]  this nanny state is not liberalism uh from my perspective and the grand
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.440]  standing you know we read the headlines they're introducing legislation
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.920]  to ban holding guns most guns are quote an assault rifle
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:39.720]  they describe any semi-auto as an assault rifle the atf last year introduced
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:44.040]  uh a rulemaking saying they want to ban all bottom-loading
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.360]  shotguns that's over 60 of those manufactured we've shown you those
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.880]  press releases they're going to go after the guns and governor
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:57.560]  my take is does that hypocrisy strike you uh with obama being such a warmonger
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.840]  and then having a peace prize i mean why not give him why not give him
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:04.520]  uh a oscar for his crying what's your take on that well again
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:10.120]  it our behavior we talk about peace and all that to our own people in our own
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:15.240]  country but throughout the world who do you think's behind these uprisings who
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:18.840]  do you think supplies the weapons to all of these
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:24.040]  whether they be gorillas or established dictatorships or whatever it is
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:30.280]  we do so how can they on one hand tell us to be passive tell us to give up our
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:34.520]  guns give up our weapons while our own government
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.600]  does nothing but sell weapons and the private gun manufacturers
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.280]  the majority of the weapons in this country i'm sure aren't even kept here i
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.720]  bet i bet you if you took the statistics and you'd know that
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:50.440]  more than i would uh i bet your more weapons are exported from the us that
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:53.960]  are here no that's actually true if you look at the numbers it's
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:59.480]  it's the us exports more than half depending on the year it's about 55
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:04.360]  percent of total arms period worldwide there you go
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.320]  so if they want to come after our second amendment
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:12.280]  let's eliminate that 55 percent of the weapons we send throughout the world
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:17.080]  that kill people and trust me these weapons we're sending out there
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.280]  you think that only soldiers are being killed by them
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.080]  the majority in all wars and uprisings are innocent civilian people
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.320]  and how many children die how many children do we
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:33.480]  of course our media won't report on it but if you go to Al Jazeera you'll learn
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:36.120]  about it oh i've seen in the libya bombardment
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.640]  little girl with her lower manable blown off with her tongue flapping all over
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:42.600]  the place crying and about the same age as one of
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.360]  my small daughters and it tears my guts out and again of all
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:49.720]  governments worldwide all countries all armaments
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.960]  the u.s is more than half of total world arm sales
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:59.480]  exactly and so if our government wants to leave by example why am i for it
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:04.760]  if our government wants to leave by example let them go first
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:10.120]  show us the example that's what i'm always saying about ted turner and all
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:13.000]  these people saying you know we should kill ourselves or so many people
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.440]  he's got five kids hey ted you go first well then you know that that's the point
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:22.440]  anyway quickly getting to the tv show tonight it's going to be a real good
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:25.560]  one i encourage people to absorb it up because it's
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.560]  going to entertain the hell out of you it deals with
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:33.800]  mind control and is there are there ways out there
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.200]  that bad people are able to do this and believe me when you see some of the
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.840]  people that i meet on the show whether it's real or not
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:46.760]  you're going to have great sympathy for these people because these people
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.440]  that have been targeted they believe they have
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:54.040]  and so it's going to it's a very interesting show tonight i encourage
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.960]  people to tune it in and uh you know with an open mind and see what's
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:01.480]  offered to you and take from it what you do all my shows
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:05.240]  uh getting into the tv show being censored uh i was told by that writer
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:08.600]  for the Atlantic magazine you did talk to him and he was thankful for that
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:11.720]  but i've yet to see that publish it may have been we should go look that up
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.440]  well i also let me go on the record and state this to Alex as much as we've
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:19.800]  we've said bad things about true tv i told that
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.120]  that writer from atlantic when i spoke with him i said i also want i want to
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:29.400]  commend 2tv for having courage because they you know maybe they did
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.400]  pull one or two of my shows but they showed all the rest of them
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.480]  and and i like to go back to that first year when i made the gentlemen's bat
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:40.920]  and i said we're going to do these shows but they're never going to see the light
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.760]  of day well amazingly 2tv did put them on
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.720]  well i want to be clear for the great deal of courage
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.480]  i want to be clear a smith coe uh michael braverman working with you guys
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.760]  three seasons great production company uh and so i don't want to criticize them
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:02.680]  uh in fact i hope they're not mad at me and again 2tv put them on alex
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:07.240]  you know 23 of these 24 shows saw the light of day
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:11.800]  no i know but i mean now you're kind of i mean you always point i'm not you know
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:15.800]  like i said i i'll take that do i wish they be shown them all
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:20.920]  absolutely i do do i wish that they would have kept me in one time slot all
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.960]  three years absolutely i do but i still want to give them credit
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:30.600]  because i never believed these shows would ever be aired no no no i totally
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:33.080]  agree with you that it's a victory it ever got on
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.840]  my only question is because i haven't even called them i i mean i hope the
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.720]  production company had met at me for bad mouthing it i don't think so
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:45.400]  no i mean i'm just frustrated that two of the best episodes got pulled the fema
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.920]  camp and the tsa but i i was surprised like you said
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:52.600]  that they ever allowed this on air and we had that private bet against the rest
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:56.280]  of the people on the show i agreed with you that none of it would ever air so i
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.200]  agree it's a big victory finally i just googled your name
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.560]  search engine your name to see if they ever ran that atlantic story they
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.720]  haven't yet because i'm told it may be in the physical
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:09.080]  magazine uh but here it is pioneer press jesse ventura
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:12.280]  lawsuit he and navy seal each claim the other
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:17.880]  is lying uh but again uh has the media covered the fact he has no why witnesses
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:20.840]  but you do no i doubt it i don't know if they
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:24.280]  have or not uh you know that was in the pie i didn't even read it it was in the
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.880]  pioneer press i think somebody told me on friday i didn't even bother with it
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:31.640]  because again when it comes to my court case i'm not
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:35.160]  going to try my case in the media i'm trying my case in a court
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:40.280]  rump when people are under oath and when people are sworn to tell the truth
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:46.040]  because alex i have truth on my side that nothing happened the event never
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.320]  happened and it's pretty difficult to perpetrate a
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:55.640]  lie in a court rump and so i just leave it at that let's go to court
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.480]  well let's a jury decide who's telling the truth he or i
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.400]  when are we gonna find out uh i mean when is this finally gonna wash
[01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:10.280]  him a while well i've no rescheduled to be in federal court i think in june
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.600]  well i'd to enact for a trial unless unless of course there is a settlement
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:19.640]  in some manner but uh we're on the docket for some time in june
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:23.160]  well i want to commend you for going after this guy for your good name because
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.960]  they're trying to demonize all of us truth seekers
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:29.800]  and they're really scared of you obviously in a 2016 run
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:33.960]  that's why they've been trying to demonize you and you know news core
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.480]  rupert murdoch who says we should turn our guns in they're behind this they
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.080]  published the book and it's just despicable how they've
[01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:46.200]  tried to assassinate your character and it just is disgusting so
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:49.400]  this may be the last time we talk until june so if you're unable to come on next
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:52.040]  week governor thank you so much for spending time with us
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:56.520]  always a pleasure alex and keep pumping it out there keep talking

[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:04.440]  i'll know if i come back in your last year then that's probably gone too

[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:31.560]  it's bad every time i follow my feelings it's right
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:35.720]  and man i've told you used to i was getting chills like maybe twice a year
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:39.320]  when i saw something happening then i started getting chills every week that

[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:53.000]  believe me the tears that i started getting in my eyes are our tears of bracing
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.600]  you know like when you see something incredible uh you'll get tears in your
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:59.160]  eyes you've ever been you've heard a piece of
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:03.160]  music and a live symphony and you get tears in your eyes it's so powerful
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:06.440]  i'm not saying i'm getting tears in my eyes because it's a good thing it's more
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:10.120]  than like like i'm sad or it's fear it's more like
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:16.120]  ooh get ready we watch your six i said that a few weeks ago i just said man i
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.720]  feel like the angel of death flapping around and maybe it's that i'm in danger
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:23.560]  but i just commit myself in the hands of god
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:27.080]  that's all i can say and and and i want to say this i keep meaning to say a
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:31.240]  prayer on air but i don't feel worthy to say a prayer on
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.600]  air i feel humble
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.560]  i just love my children so much and i and i love my children so much in their
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:46.200]  innocence i love other people's children
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:49.320]  and i know what everybody's thinking and saying who's got children that's what
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:52.520]  the globalists use the murder of children to control us
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:56.520]  and it makes me so mad at the democrats who are just murdering children
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:01.880]  everywhere with ones in abandon trying to force women in india
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:06.280]  and china and africa and latin america to have abortions
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.760]  and they are forcing them the apple factories where they do forced abortions
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:14.840]  like mainstream news and then i've got to be lectured all day by them about how
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.240]  much they love kids i mean it just i know they're criminal dirtbag
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:22.600]  filth i know they got it out for us okay i know
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.000]  intellectually i know geopolitically they're bad
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.360]  bad bad bad bad the democrats and liberals are the vanguard of
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:36.040]  the new world order the republicans are their camp follower
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.480]  placeholders meant to fool us to think there's opposition
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:42.760]  so we don't really get involved the republicans are
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:48.200]  our horrible benedict arnold stinking compromisers
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.720]  okay so i don't like them either but the democrats are the ones that want to
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:55.080]  collectivize i mean you can pull it up obama took the
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:59.560]  funding off three and a half years ago uh that uh to his credit
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:03.720]  ronald reagan had had had had killed uh to to to
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.960]  force women to have abortions in africa and it's not some
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:12.920]  bleedy heart thing okay about i'm trendy so i don't kill the black people
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:16.920]  man let me tell you folks if they can abort those women's kids forcibly
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.520]  they can get me again you and it's not that
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:23.560]  it's not that i intellectually make that decision to get upset
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:26.920]  i can ant just a gut level i'm threatened by that and then i can analyze
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:31.720]  why is your gut threatened by that because the gut knows the gut the gut knows
[01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:36.200]  everything the gut and it's not even the gut it's the heart
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.280]  it people call it the gut it's right here in my heart i know things i feel
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.920]  things i was talking to one of the reporters
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:47.560]  who's moved down here and his family still he hadn't been able to move down
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.280]  here yet because austin's so hard to get into its boom
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:53.960]  town compared to rest of the country and i came in that morning before we even
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.440]  knew about that you know i walked in they said i heard about the
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.440]  shooting and i said yeah i heard there's a shooting
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.920]  you know one dad you know at first it wasn't wasn't all being reported
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:06.760]  and i told my wife that night i said i'm having dread i told i told uh
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:09.400]  and i walked in i said bad stuff's about to happen
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.760]  and one of our reporters i didn't ask permission and i don't know if he wants
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:16.520]  me to tell the story but i'll i won't i won't tell it unless he wants to
[01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:19.080]  tell it he said you know i talked to my wife she had a
[01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:22.600]  horrible nightmare that night of men repelling down into a
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:27.240]  school and shooting little kids and
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:32.360]  his wife's a teacher and it was one of those dreams that upset her so bad she
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.280]  called her friends about it see i've had dreams that actually come
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.320]  true before that i've told people about and then they come through
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:44.040]  six months later and as i walked around the corner
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.400]  and this guy tried to mug me
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:51.400]  i had a sick feeling walk around the corner going i've been here before
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:56.360]  and it was the dream and the guy and the shirt and everything
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.360]  but but again i'm not getting off into mumbo jumbo here the point is is that i
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:04.280]  told everybody i'm physically sick that whole week i said i it's something
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.960]  bad and it's not just the murder of these three little precious children
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.960]  it's that they're launching this is the bugles sounding
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:16.760]  the charge is on they're coming they're coming what i say last week on the show
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.880]  i think on monday's show i use the lord of the rings analogy
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:23.480]  fellowship of the ring when they're in um the minds of moria
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.920]  and they're reading the book about you know drums drums in the deep they are
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.680]  coming they are coming and they hear the drums
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:34.440]  drums drums in the deep and they're like get ready and i said get ready
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:38.360]  get ready get ready i mean we've got instincts that god gave us ladies and
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:42.680]  gentlemen and my instincts are just going off like
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.360]  bloody murder right now bloody murder okay and it isn't just these 20 kids
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.440]  i'm telling you ladies and gentlemen things are about to get
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:48:00.040]  really bad i've never ever ever felt anything even close to this
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.440]  and i remember i went on air and said they're going to blow up the world trade
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.240]  center and blame it on bin laden july 25th and jimmy von is one of my
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:10.680]  witnesses the blues singer he saw that and that's what woke him up the show
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.640]  because then two months later he saw the attack
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:16.600]  and of course there's the video me on access tv saying it too and i did it on
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.320]  the radio but the point is is that i had a gut
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.080]  feeling about that also i could see all the preparations
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:28.120]  so it's a combination and it's not like something i can even control it's not
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:32.040]  like my brain says there's gold buried in that field go go dig it up
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:35.960]  or you know i know the lottery ticket it's not that i only have discernment
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:41.000]  folks on things that are big and affect humanity and let me tell you something
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.640]  what i'm feeling is 10 times anything i've ever felt
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:51.400]  maybe 20 times i mean it's such a feeling of concern i can't even describe it to
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.840]  you and i just pray that this country in this
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:58.920]  world repent for the abortions and all the bad things we've done
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.320]  and i pray that people will open their eyes but we'll also put that into action
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:07.240]  to stand up against evil because it's coming in like a flood
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:11.080]  and i pray that the spirit of the lord will lift up a standard against it
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:14.600]  please god there are so many innocents in this country and i know we're evil
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:17.400]  but the enemy has just gotten us with the television
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:21.640]  and high tech systems of control and i know that we're like dirty rags but
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:25.240]  please please give this country in this world a second chance
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:31.720]  whatever is about to happen just please please please give us a chance
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:35.560]  like like neneva was given when your prophet
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:41.400]  jonah was sent there and and give us a reprieve if we'll humble ourselves and
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:45.400]  and repent amen i mean that's my simple prayer ladies and
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.280]  gentlemen but
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.240]  being this awake is exhausting i mean i'll just tell you right now because
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:57.160]  and it's frustrating to know how wicked these democratic party operatives are
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:04.520]  how bad they are how evil they are how duplicitous how murderous
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:09.720]  and you know i try to hold back my gut tells me the white house
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.480]  people controlling the governments were involved in this that that's what my gut
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:16.360]  tells me and i told you that on batman and it
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:19.400]  came out he was in a mind control program department of defense had a
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.000]  department of defense psychiatrist assigned to him people said folks let
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.280]  him in uh smoke bombs from both sides he told
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:29.800]  people in the jail he was under mind control i mean that came out too i mean
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.080]  they're doing it they're doing it they're staging it
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:37.000]  that's what my gut tells me it's never been wrong but i'm not gonna just sit
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.320]  here on air and lie to you about how i'm feeling right now
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:45.000]  for all we know i mean they're demonized in this goth guy they profiled and set
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.680]  up he may not even be it he was under psychiatric care again

[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:47.480]  they're killing thousands of children every month
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:51.560]  worldwide handing them over to al-qaeda bombing their villages blowing their
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:54.760]  arms and legs off blowing their lower mandibles off as
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:59.160]  children run screaming their tongues hanging out like columbian neck ties

[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.960]  handing over a country to al-qaeda by the way folks i don't know if this was
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.280]  staged or not it has a lot of the signs the batman thing had even more
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:29.240]  and now i mean come on DARPA mind control program
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.920]  mainstream news telling people in jail he was under mind control on and on and
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:38.040]  on but even mainstream news has been reporting on that now
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:41.640]  but in this case the globalist will always
[01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:45.080]  get something in your face and in the dark night rises
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:48.360]  and we're going to put this up on screen i'll plug the youtube channel it's on

[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:57.080]  report on this uh the only thing you can read on
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:03.320]  the uh map from cyber tribe network from a clip from the
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:06.680]  film is sandy hook and they're talking about how they're going to bring it
[01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.000]  down uh there from the dark night rises and again
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:15.160]  they ran six months before 9 11 where the government hijacks a jet by remote
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.600]  control to blame it on al-qaeda using a terror drill as the cover
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:22.920]  to fly the jumbo jet in the world's red center so they can attack afghanistan
[01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:26.920]  sandy hook let's go ahead and play uh what they break down here
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:29.400]  here it is
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:32.920]  oh yeah i'm going to play it on air that that's why i was saying
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:37.800]  we're going to we're going to play it on air the uh video
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:40.360]  uh of it
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:45.640]  okay just whenever you're ready talking about a plane in the movie
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:48.680]  you see him pointing there right there by the walkie talkies
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:53.080]  well if you get a close zoom up on the shot before he puts his hand on the
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:56.360]  actual map you see it here what does it say
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:59.560]  sandy hook it's the only thing that you could read
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:04.440]  out of the whole map on this particular scene
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:07.960]  uh don't you guys think that's a little strange look at that sandy hook this is
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:14.680]  the dark the dark night rises batman movie and i think
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:17.720]  they've made a number of references yeah that could be that could be a
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:22.440]  coincidence but not the hundreds of of of tv shows
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:26.280]  and things where 9 11 isn't attacked that's coming for years before 9 11 or
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:30.040]  where the government hijacks a jet to blame it on al-qaeda
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:33.240]  by remote control to fly it in the world trade center
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:38.920]  to blame afghanistan no this is all preconditioning
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.040]  and this is what the globalists are into it's it's all a giant
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:46.520]  public occult ritual they call it lesser magic they need to tell you about what
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:51.000]  they're going to do over and over again before they actually do it

[02:00:30.520 --> 02:00:34.680]  we're gonna go to bill mike michael and others uh i'm gonna recap it all but
[02:00:34.680 --> 02:00:38.680]  they're coming after our guns and i told you on air actually the last few
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:42.200]  weeks get ready they're coming after our guns that's the cover of the
[02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:45.960]  december issue of the magazine and i said he'd use executive order to do it
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:48.920]  that's what they're announcing now we're in a lot of trouble and there's going
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:53.720]  to be more there's going to be more and i believe the evidence is overwhelming
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:56.920]  we know they staged some of these things if they'll do medical experiments on
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:00.200]  little kids and kill them the people running our government they'll they'll
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:03.160]  they'll stage shootings and kill somebody they've drugged up under the
[02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.760]  psychiatric care and have the real shooter slip out the back door
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:09.720]  and when they keep changing stories like they've done as much as they've done
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:12.360]  that's another telltale sign and they'll do it in a place like
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:16.600]  connecticut where they've got total globalist control uh let's go ahead and
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:19.880]  talk to bill in california you're on the air watching us via
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:25.560]  prisonplanet.tv go ahead hello there i think it's time to talk about
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:31.640]  individuals role in this and their responsibilities to take care of themselves
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:37.160]  their family and their neighbors and first of all they need to get
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:44.120]  their own principles in order start with the golden rule
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:49.240]  and measure everything you see by the golden rule
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:54.440]  and the corollary to that is the non-aggression principle
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.280]  then get out there talk to your neighbors get to know them
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:03.240]  uh you may not like them but at least you get to know them
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:08.520]  and then prepare yourself and your family and don't take anybody else's word for
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:14.600]  when to start uh resistance draw your line know where your own line is
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:20.760]  so my line is this i am completely defensive no offensive action but i'm
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:24.600]  not going to a FEMA camp and i'm not turning my guns in
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:28.280]  great that's the way to do it
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:33.880]  but you know but i mean you know if you held your hand up when they put you in
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:37.560]  a pit to shoot you that'll be called resistance and terrorism
[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:41.480]  i mean if you hold it i mean in nazi germany if you tried to shield a child
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:44.760]  they were shooting you were called an extremist i mean like this government
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:48.120]  is so evil they know look do you agree with me though
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:51.880]  because well the polls show it that america by and large has woken up to
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.560]  the fact we have an evil government the election wasn't real none of this is
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:59.000]  real anymore that's right but you have to have
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.880]  your own line in your own house and my line is
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:07.400]  don't let them move you or your family stay where you are
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:12.520]  it's better to die where you are than to go to a camp
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.000]  well all i know is they've built the camps and they've they've got the billion
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.760]  six bullets and they've got the they're announcing martial law all over the
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:24.520]  country in towns having checkpoints and guys with machine guns
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.440]  because of this shooting i mean how ridiculous deer kill
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:31.800]  three or four times a year what mass shootings do
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:36.280]  i should i showed those statistics yesterday i mean they're totally hyping
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:41.800]  it there's no doubt this is all hyped absolutely
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:45.000]  and the fact still remains that individuals
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  with firearms stop more crimes than they
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.360]  commit well that's right i was corrected a few weeks ago i said you know
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:56.440]  20 something times a gun's used and to stop a crime more than it's used in a
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:59.240]  crime and then i was sent by everybody
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:03.000]  mainstream news articles it's something like 80 something times
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.360]  so i was incorrect i don't know where the numbers i had were from
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:10.600]  some other study but the point is it's not debatable
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:15.080]  that that but at the same time even though mass shootings are flat
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:19.080]  there's still a tragedy it's just that they're making it personal they're
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:23.960]  personalizing these little kids why doesn't the news show us the kids that
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:28.280]  i've gone and watched and we tried to put it on youtube once and they took our
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:30.840]  channel down so i'm you know i'm not going to
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:33.800]  blow our whole channel just people should go look up
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:37.720]  children in in er's under libya bombardment
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:40.920]  and folks you won't want to watch zombie movies again and stuff where it's
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:43.800]  simulated i mean you see little kids with arms and
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:48.840]  legs blown off begging for mama and their faces blown off
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:52.040]  that isn't some dehumanized zombie that's a little four-year-old girl
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:55.800]  with her face blown off wondering where a lower manable is with her tongue all
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:00.920]  over the place that'll get you religion real quick
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:06.360]  we have witnessed two terrible storms in the east but we are still in the eye

[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:25.800]  live from austin texas alex jones i was reading press reports
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:32.600]  about the coroner in the connecticut school shooting breaking down
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:36.520]  when they were examining the 20 dead little children
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:41.880]  the kindergartners and others who had on on an average three to 11 bullets in
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:45.080]  them a piece that's hundreds of bullets this one
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:50.120]  guy supposedly fired into them without his firearm jamming
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:53.080]  but the media is giving it almost no attention
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:57.480]  there was a san antonio shooting where an off-duty police officer had his gun
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.560]  everybody else was barred from having one and shot the guy who just shot a
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:04.520]  couple people and that was the case in oregon where
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:07.480]  where a citizen had his concealed carry in the
[02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:11.320]  mall the guy started shooting and as soon as he saw the guy behind a pillar
[02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:15.560]  aiming the gun he shoved the gun in his mouth and killed himself
[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:19.800]  and in mind control they call that the disposal mechanism
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:26.360]  because they're not meant to be captured uh in the case of the batman shooter
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.960]  he he did go out and then get captured
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:33.960]  and now it's been confirmed in local news reports he did tell people
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:38.840]  that he was under mind control uh and didn't know who he was and he had been
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:43.960]  in a DARPA advanced computer brain interface
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:47.480]  mind control program with the department of defense and had a
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:51.080]  cop air force she'd run all the san antonio psychiatric facilities
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:55.400]  assigned out there and she was over him meeting multiple times a week with a
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:10:00.920]  notebook i mean red flags are just boing boing boing
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:07.640]  danger will robinson danger will robinson in every sense
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:11.640]  of the matter remember robby the robot
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:17.400]  danger will robinson there is an enemy approaching from the east
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:24.280]  and it goes on and on from there sirhen sirhen cnn associated press the
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:28.840]  police at the time said his gun never hit rfk
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:32.760]  that it wasn't the same caliber that his arm had been pinned down sirhen sirhen
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:36.920]  was witnessed being drugged in his drink by the one with a polka dot dress
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:41.000]  sirhen sirhen's lawyers now say that the police say that
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:46.680]  the police say he didn't do it we know the cia guy that shot kennedy
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:51.080]  talk about jfk being open and shut rfk is so open and shut
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:57.320]  it will make your head spin you know in the rfk case oh i'm not going to get
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:59.560]  off into it i'm going to go to your phone calls
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:02.440]  it's just if the government's done this stuff before
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:05.960]  what is the government it's a mafia that took control of the country with the
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:09.080]  1913 fellow reserve act to a beachhead extent
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:12.680]  then expanded with the national security act of 47 where
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:17.720]  megabanks could operate behind national security with diplomatic community
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:21.560]  with unlimited taxpayer funds gee you think there might be some corruption
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:24.200]  going on there
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:29.560]  and now the un has diplomatic immunity and the president tells the congress
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.240]  see it's all the stuff that's happening we're under un control
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:37.720]  they're announcing world government they're saying don't worry
[02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:41.080]  we're going to register and take all the semi autos
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:44.360]  the nra said hey they're coming after the guns in the new year
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.360]  we've been warned that the the anti-gun groups make the announcement
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:53.160]  we see a huge buildup did you know five nights in a row in the buildup
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:55.880]  well the first four nights monday tuesday wednesday thursday and then of
[02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:59.880]  course friday the four nights leading up to the shooting last friday
[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:03.560]  i went i heard about this from listeners i went and looked it up it was true
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:09.800]  see it in an msnbc both for the four nights leading up we're doing gun
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.240]  control we've got to ban the semi autos
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:18.440]  i mean how much more obvious does this get there's 315 million people in this
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:23.400]  country keeps saying 312 it's 315 plus and that's the last
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:29.400]  census so it's probably 320 million you're going to have
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:33.000]  people getting shot every day just like there's car wrecks every day
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.160]  just like people drowned every day but they they get everybody so
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:41.640]  scared of the image of the gun people who were ignorant of the gun
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:44.600]  but what's happening is the gun culture is wanting because people are going on
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:48.360]  and buying guns at record numbers
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:52.520]  and they're finding out wow this makes me feel safe wow this is easy to use
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:58.120]  wow this is no big deal and then every day in local papers
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:02.440]  never national people are getting robbed defend themselves with guns store gets
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:05.480]  robbed defend yourself with gun woman jogging has a
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:09.240]  fanny pack man tries to rape her shooting i mean
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:13.720]  i kept saying 20 plus times for every crime people defend themselves against
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:17.240]  crime with a gun i was wrong i was sent the numbers last week it's 80 plus
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:21.240]  times and the system knows this so they're in an irrational
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:25.000]  race to demonize the second amendment and the right to keep and burn arms
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:31.480]  they are in in in in in a totally irrational race
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:37.880]  to blame the NRA and say the NRA are the Ku Klux Klan that's Fox Sports
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:41.400]  three weeks ago and that we've got to ban the guns at any time there's a crime
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:45.400]  with a gun it's your fault because somebody did
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.800]  something bad like Jesse Ventura said last hour
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.240]  do we blame somebody when they run someone over with a car do we blame
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:56.680]  Ford or General Motors no we don't so see the collectivists have this idea
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.040]  that they're going to be safe once the guns are gone no you'll be in the highest
[02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:04.360]  crime rate areas because the criminals will always have the guns and i know
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:09.400]  those of us that are gun owners know this or if somebody does hurt us with a gun
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:13.480]  we don't blame the gun that's a criminal
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:17.800]  you know they had an Austin cop this year shot at a walmart in total cold
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:21.400]  blood the guy it turned out was on psychotropic drugs
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:26.360]  and alcohol they don't mix cop walks in guy shoots him for no reason in cold
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:32.600]  blood didn't even know who he was they're still charging him
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:38.040]  with murder one last time i read premeditated capital murder
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:42.760]  premeditated folks i'd be okay execute the guy the point is
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:45.880]  that's not going to bring that police officer back
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:50.600]  the sergeant veils on the psychotropics and steroids animal area drug it's now
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:53.480]  come out oh but in the back of the paper we
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:56.840]  covered it yesterday the guy that snuck over the wall
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:00.600]  in afghanistan four tours and went and killed
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:05.080]  shot and stabbed 16 people most of the children and burned their bodies
[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:08.840]  had been under psychiatric care and didn't want to be sent back
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:13.640]  he shouldn't be going to jail he should be suing the military for putting him on
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:16.280]  those drugs well they said he wasn't supposed to be on the
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:20.360]  steroids they put him on the other stuff the malaria drug can make you go
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:23.480]  psychopathic i'm not trying to get people out of jail
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:29.160]  but if somebody's on pcp you charge them for being on illegal drug
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:31.560]  and manslaughter because they didn't mean it
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:35.080]  i mean you can't charge someone on pcp that kills somebody
[02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:38.600]  for premeditated they're doing it they're on pcp
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:42.680]  you can't blame some army sergeant who goes haywire
[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:45.880]  on a bunch of drugs
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:51.960]  it's not the law is you've got to be doing it on purpose
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:55.560]  if somebody slipped you five hits of acid in your drink at a bar
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:59.000]  you'd probably get really whacked out and if somebody looked at you wrong you
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.040]  might kill them are you going to go to jail
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:07.640]  you're going to be civilly liable to the family for killing their family member
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:11.400]  you might be able to get manslaughter but you didn't do it on
[02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:16.760]  purpose and it's the same thing we are now
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:21.480]  lead the world in suicide and we lead the world in serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:24.920]  i'm going to shut up now we're going to go to michael in texas
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:31.160]  listening on our big dfw station 16 30 a.m k k g m
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:36.200]  michael thank you for holding what is your take on this situation sir
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:41.960]  hi alex um well i just i thought i noticed something funny the other day
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:46.840]  um i was listening to the president addressing the nation
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:50.760]  and he was crying and he was talking about how
[02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:54.600]  you know sad was the loss of life and the future that they were going to have
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:17:00.440]  and all the loss and you never hear him say anything about that about abortion
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:04.440]  and there's 2000 plus abortions every day
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:08.280]  and un policies would kill a billion people of the carbon taxes were put in
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:10.920]  place this is a guy i'm sorry go ahead and make your
[02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:13.720]  point you're right oh no that's my point i just
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:18.040]  i mean i'll pull you off the air i just wanted to put that out there because i
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:21.560]  i hear so many people who are pro abortions talking about how sad this
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:25.480]  is today and i want to know what the reason is for why that's a loss of life
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:29.400]  but another one is not i hear you appreciate your point
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:34.040]  yeah what's happening is you got a bunch of bandwagon people
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:37.320]  who are turning their guns in today all over the country and
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:40.440]  crying and saying how dare you say he's not really crying
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:44.600]  they want to believe they're part of something well be part of something real
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:48.440]  not part of of obama a certified duplicitous
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:55.480]  snake like teleprompter reader who who is proven to be a incredibly deceptive
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:18:00.120]  person and is using this to try to take our
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:05.880]  basic liberties and people just love getting all obsessed with it and
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:09.400]  feeling like oh we're going to do something together because they're so
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:13.320]  naive and domesticated mike and origan listening on an android app
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:17.640]  go ahead sir hey alex how's it going i'm pretty
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:21.160]  bummed out because this is this is their first shot in the battle that they're
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:25.800]  coming for everything i can't agree more i'm so freaked out
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:28.520]  and just sit here and watch the media just
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:32.680]  hide it up and basically just call out all the mass murders like hey we're ready
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:35.800]  to give you all the credit in the world for what you're doing and
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:39.960]  but not yeah they're begging they're begging to cause a cascade copycat
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:43.480]  they want it so bad it's making their head spin
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:47.080]  yeah but they'll give no credit to a 22 year old with was
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:51.080]  totally within the law at the clock in his town center who saved lives
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:54.520]  they want to talk about that where's obama giving him a peace prize or did he
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:57.880]  have to ship 20 handguns and grenades into Mexico
[02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:01.560]  to kill much people well yeah don't forget they staged
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:04.600]  larry pratt said they may have staged the batman because they stage fast and
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:07.640]  furious it came out to blame the second amendment
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:11.560]  20 000 handguns and rifles and a bunch of hand grenades and stuff you can't even
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:15.320]  get at gun shops they shipped it in there to cause havoc

[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:32.200]  you know i'm really proud of the fact that we take video clips of eric
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:35.000]  holder saying he wants to brainwash the second amendment and now that's
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:40.120]  mainstream news or we dig up the clips our listeners do of
[02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:43.400]  ron emmanuel saying we're just going to put you on no gun by list no judge no

[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.040]  the answer is just keep spreading the gun culture because you notice the
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:04.840]  globalists don't just attack guns they attack the culture
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:08.360]  they've tried to get rid of every culture out there everything americana
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:13.880]  and replace it with globalism being pushed by hollywood
[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:17.640]  so they're threatened by the gun culture because it's part of the individualistic
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:20.840]  culture it's part of the male culture the female
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:24.520]  culture of taking care of yourself let's put drudgereport.com up on screen

[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:55.400]  and you notice the union heads have been saying attack people and that's been
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:59.400]  happening they want a divide and conquer they want to cause the civil war

[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:06.520]  your calls look at this right because i don't want to just mention this uh and
[02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:11.160]  then not uh actually get to it this is out of the insurance journal car and
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:17.160]  deer collisions cost 200 deaths and cost four billion dollars a gear on average
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:20.440]  on average and it goes on there's actually a little more than 200 they
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:24.440]  rounded it down 200 deaths from deer these see
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:29.880]  obama up there crying about deer 200 deaths a year now let's look
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:33.000]  now now this is this is using liberal numbers
[02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:39.720]  from the nation anti-gun publication 16 u.s mass shootings happened in 2012
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:43.960]  leaving at least 88 dead i spent an hour yesterday trying to get the real numbers
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:47.320]  on this but more than half of these were gangs
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:51.320]  shooting at each other and they call
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:59.240]  those mass shootings when gangs are shooting back and forth at each other
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:05.720]  okay so so it's it's way less than 88 but but but but there's the justice
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:09.240]  department's numbers that say we should be brainwashed
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:12.920]  88 deaths versus 200 again ladies and gentlemen
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:17.640]  there are hundreds of thousands of people who die every year
[02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.240]  from flesh-eating bacteria and other hospital complications
[02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:25.560]  but they don't add that to the to the statistics of cause of death they don't

[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:52.520]  for the nightly news tonight and we'll go to your calls
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:55.720]  where we show uh well they you know what they'll let you see
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:00.280]  dead children on tv here but but they won't show you the pictures of the
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:03.240]  kids overseas and if we do show you that we can show it to you at

[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:12.680]  they'll let terrorists killing kids be on there if it's pro war
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:16.840]  but if it shows what the love of president is doing it's not allowed to
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:19.800]  be seen but you can still go out there and
[02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:24.920]  find it just type emergency rooms libya or emergency room syria you want to
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:28.280]  see or al-qaeda cutting fathers heads off that
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:32.280]  won't suicide bomb for them or blowing up churches you think you
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:37.400]  can watch it because it's out there
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:40.920]  and let me tell you it has the same effect on me that hearing about these
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:43.960]  20 dead kids does
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:49.000]  so here's obama talking about love and i mean after all only white people can
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.360]  be hateful and evils he's supposedly part black so
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:57.320]  it's okay and he's got a peace price why not give him five more
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:01.240]  eight more how about giving 14 peace prizes for every country
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:04.360]  he's attacking outside international and national law
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:09.240]  where collateral damage is no big deal to kill unlimited kids
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:14.440]  how about that you know i had an article here where a drone pilot
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:18.040]  here's the article right here did we just kill a kid the six words that ended a
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:23.480]  drone pilot's career if you say on the record we killed a kid then you get in
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:31.800]  trouble
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:34.600]  and uh
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:39.320]  and the military chime back in and said no that's a dog you'll change your
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:43.320]  report and then when he didn't
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:49.560]  well you know what happened again the only crime in america is
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:52.520]  recognizing when the police shoot a kid in the back
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:56.600]  or or they tasers somebody and they die or when the government's being evil
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:59.800]  there's no crying about that you're taught when to cry
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:04.680]  when the government says oh the guns are bad they did it let's pat them
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:10.200]  crying it's about love obama says
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:16.920]  it's about love when they lined up tens of thousands of blacks that live in
[02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:19.880]  libyan killed them with al-qaeda out of saudi arabia
[02:43:19.880 --> 02:43:25.560]  ethnically cleansed them you didn't hear one black leader say a word
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:33.080]  about it because it was cute obama he gave us a phone
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:39.720]  he's gonna do more and now people are like yeah we won obama won
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:44.200]  we're taking your guns ah we're gonna kill you
[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:47.400]  and i'm getting these emails and these tweets and these facebook's and these
[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:50.600]  youtube's and it's just like a bunch of crazy people like it's their sports team
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:53.720]  ah you're just mad your team lost something no no no both teams were bad
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:57.480]  but you're part of the chosen team i'm you know we're being taken over ah
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:00.760]  shut up we're gonna kill you
[02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:05.640]  we are a decadent slob-like nation on average there are a lot of great people
[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:09.320]  but the good news is a hard-working smart person regardless what race color
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:12.600]  greed you are when you stand up against an evil globalist blob
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:16.040]  you're like a hundred people for every one of us show
[02:44:16.040 --> 02:44:19.160]  you better get aggressive you better get focused
[02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:25.480]  because we're in trouble society is crumbling right in front of our eyes
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:29.800]  and banning the guns is not going to
[02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:33.800]  fix that fact that guns are one of the few things in areas where the police are
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:36.360]  standing now the the honest police are saying you
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:39.560]  better buy guns all over the country and you better lock your doors and buy
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:42.600]  guns because they're they're cutting our force in half and we're being told
[02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:46.440]  just to revenue generate can't get a cop to respond to your house in many
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:49.720]  cities to 30 plus crimes in oakland but you can sure see them out there
[02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:53.000]  radar gun and all day to make some money
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.240]  let's go ahead and go to obama talking about about love
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:02.680]  and just image all the kids blown in half one thing we can be sure
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:05.880]  then that is the love that we have
[02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:11.400]  for our children for our families
[02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:13.960]  for each other
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:20.520]  the warmth of a small child's embrace that is true
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:25.320]  the memories we have of them the hit pause the joy that
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:29.880]  yeah they do actually use the blood trails from the children
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:33.720]  and people running with wounded children are actually uses blood trails
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:37.800]  to target the full family to kill them like private gruckheimer talked about
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:40.600]  how they would go into areas of afghanistan and kill everyone in the
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:45.160]  village and the army clarified on foxes that well only certain villages
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:49.800]  but yeah they kill everyone babies everyone and and you know that last
[02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:52.440]  breath that warm embrace i think that's probably what
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:57.720]  mr satan is talking about here i mean these people are evil folks okay
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:00.680]  so so let's go back to him try to manipulate the families and create a
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:03.320]  relationship with them because he had a private meeting with them
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:06.120]  afterwards try to get him to crusade against guns like
[02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:10.840]  cerebrating so he's like trying to reach out to them that last warm embrace
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:15.000]  trying to make him break down and cry just and you can see it he's a total
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.520]  demon psycho while he's doing this just feeding off the pain
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:21.880]  i've been at cps hearings where they're taking innocent kids and the parents
[02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:24.760]  cry and the judge just demonically just shakes going
[02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:26.920]  oh i'm sucking up so much pain right now
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:30.760]  hey you're faking i mean it's just it's total linda blare
[02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:35.720]  exorcist stuff okay let's go back to the demon here it is
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:38.760]  oh he's sucking it wonder we see through their eyes
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:42.120]  through their eyes that fierce and boundless love
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:45.480]  we feel for them you wish you could have brought them all takes us
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:49.480]  out of ourselves and binds us to something larger yeah at the abortion
[02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:54.520]  clinics the forced abortion facilities and apple factories
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:47:02.040]  we know we're always doing right when we're taking care of them with deadly
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:06.440]  vaccines and sodium fluoride mercury teaching them well 3000 increases in
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:09.480]  cancers and children showing acts of kindness
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:13.880]  we don't go wrong when we do that when tsa drags a kid away and grubs them as
[02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:17.720]  they cry for mommy or a little cancer victim that's what we can be sure of
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:20.440]  we can be sure that you'll be able to keep persecuting children that's what you
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:26.520]  the people of newtown have reminded us oh
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:30.360]  that's how you've inspired us you've inspired oh you're the mindless
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:33.400]  what matters you're the martyrs now you're going to be used to
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:37.800]  wave the bloody shirt to take the guns and that's what should drive us
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:41.400]  forward in everything we do all the drone attacks all the murders
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:44.440]  god sees fit to keep us on this earth all the little kids with their lower
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:48.120]  mandibles missing crying for mommy with blood spraying everywhere

[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:01.480]  fake crying right on cue of course audio isn't as powerful but it's an old limbaugh
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:05.160]  club uh for miss tv show but first here is obama with these fake
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:08.280]  pauses all of it but it didn't go over too well so

[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:16.200]  too many of these tragedies in the past few years
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:20.760]  and each time i learned the news i react
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:25.000]  not as a president but as anybody else would
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:30.440]  as a parent and that was especially true today taxpayer funded abortion is that
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:34.040]  it i know there's not a parent in america
[02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:38.360]  who doesn't feel the same overwhelming grief that i do
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:43.720]  his only grief is that majority of those who died today were children
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:47.960]  beautiful little kids between the ages of five and ten years old
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:50.920]  well but you have a grief that the vaccine didn't like kill them slowly or

[03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:36.360]  your take on this well my take on this is the following
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:40.520]  as reported in uh the new york times yesterday so people get some idea what's
[03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:44.120]  going on the justice department it seems over the last year has made a
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:47.160]  recommendation that all agencies that pay out
[03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:52.200]  benefit checks to people uh should in fact and i think
[03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:54.920]  this is what the administration is one of the things are going to put into
[03:00:54.920 --> 03:00:58.280]  effect real quick on his executive authority
[03:00:58.280 --> 03:01:02.840]  executive powers authority want these agencies that pay out checks
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:06.440]  uh to people to report these met the medical information concerning these
[03:01:06.440 --> 03:01:10.920]  people into the fbi database so you're going to have the uh
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:15.000]  medical experts and of course that's sarcastic when i say that at the fbi
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.480]  they're now going to have the information of everybody that gets

[03:08:20.040 --> 03:08:24.360]  he taught a few firearms classes this weekend said it was just quiet as a
[03:08:24.360 --> 03:08:28.360]  church mouse nobody talking gun shops overflowing with people
[03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:32.680]  but ninja silent this is the scyop where gun owners
[03:08:32.680 --> 03:08:36.200]  even feel guilty your guns murdered these kids
[03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:41.240]  your you did it and yeah the new Ku Klux Klan is the NRA
[03:08:41.240 --> 03:08:45.400]  yeah people need to kill them there's mainstream news articles now covering
[03:08:45.400 --> 03:08:48.840]  yeah we're gonna march on you and we're gonna take you down and

[03:08:56.680 --> 03:09:00.600]  and again jesse ventura was on earlier he pointed out he goes when people kill
[03:09:00.600 --> 03:09:04.200]  folks with cars on purpose all the time do we blame ford
[03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:07.320]  do you blame ginsu knives and somebody stabs someone with them
[03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:10.680]  i mean knives kill more than guns every year sorry
[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:16.200]  mass killings 88 this year 200 plus according to the insurance i covered
[03:09:16.200 --> 03:09:19.880]  it last hour from deer jumping in front of your car
[03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:23.080]  but the media doesn't make it all scary and all the reporters on the news
[03:09:23.080 --> 03:09:25.880]  oh we're so sad everyone's struggling this right now
[03:09:25.880 --> 03:09:29.240]  look at this little child turn your guns in now
[03:09:29.240 --> 03:09:32.680]  meanwhile we're predator droning and using al-qaeda and lining up little
[03:09:32.680 --> 03:09:36.520]  african children and hack you've seen the kids in libya hacked up with machetes
[03:09:36.520 --> 03:09:39.800]  because the bullets are too expensive when the al-qaeda folks are chopping up
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:42.920]  little black kids why don't you go oh but obama didn't go
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:47.160]  i launched the libyan operation and al-qaeda we put in
[03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:53.080]  is chopping up begging children with machetes
[03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:57.080]  i mean it's it's as fake as those north koreans crying at kim jong il's funeral
[03:09:57.080 --> 03:10:00.040]  i'm sick of it
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:06.920]  it is a giant psi op against the american people
[03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:11.080]  a psychological warfare operation i told you three weeks ago
[03:10:11.080 --> 03:10:15.400]  the december issue of the magazine came out it's sold out now folks
[03:10:15.400 --> 03:10:18.920]  and i said this man wants your guns he's going to use executive power to do it
[03:10:18.920 --> 03:10:23.560]  headline today president set to use executive power to restrict guns
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:30.440]  importation banal not just sale but possession of surplus ammo
[03:10:30.440 --> 03:10:34.120]  oh it's bad wait till matt williams gets in here let's go to former new york
[03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:37.320]  police officer he's giving us a lot of good intel i think ron's been calling
[03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:40.680]  since about 1999 so i guess 13 years he's been a
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:44.040]  listener and he gets through every once in a while always gives us great info
[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:46.680]  uh in fact what he was saying earlier if you just tuned in i can confirm everything
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:50.120]  he's saying ron you got three minutes before i go to other calls uh tell folks
[03:10:50.120 --> 03:10:53.720]  uh the new mental health system and your doctor's spying on you
[03:10:53.720 --> 03:10:57.320]  and how they're going to take all the veterans guns uh rama manual has made
[03:10:57.320 --> 03:11:00.840]  the announcement go ahead well they're expanding it even
[03:11:00.840 --> 03:11:05.080]  beyond the veterans now what they've been doing to the veterans since 1999 and
[03:11:05.080 --> 03:11:09.560]  what they're going to do to all americans this plan was on the shelf for the last
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:14.200]  year the obama administration didn't put it into effect because of the election
[03:11:14.200 --> 03:11:18.040]  and probably they were waiting for an incident to exploit or an incident that
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:22.360]  they fomented to happen to exploit but now they want any of the government
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:27.240]  agencies all agencies that give out benefits like the social
[03:11:27.240 --> 03:11:30.920]  security administration but not limited to the social security administration
[03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:34.840]  to turn your medical records over to the fbi nix database
[03:11:34.840 --> 03:11:39.560]  so uh there goes medical privacy and the justice department has the audacity
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:43.960]  to justify itself is stated in this article that this is lawful and proper
[03:11:43.960 --> 03:11:49.080]  now these these organizations social security and more have had these uh
[03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:51.400]  information and been doing this for many years
[03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:54.200]  they have never done that and turn that information over
[03:11:54.200 --> 03:11:57.880]  so now we have an administration that comes up with something um i think they
[03:11:57.880 --> 03:12:01.720]  use the term in nazi germany novel legal theories
[03:12:01.720 --> 03:12:05.560]  uh to get access to the database of people
[03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:09.320]  their medical record database their medical records and turn them over to a
[03:12:09.320 --> 03:12:13.000]  law enforcement agency now the historical examples of when that
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:16.120]  happened that we know because this has happened through history
[03:12:16.120 --> 03:12:19.560]  have been catastrophic when that happens when they start databaseing
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:24.520]  people's you know hitler brought in all his tyranny in 33 34 with medical
[03:12:24.520 --> 03:12:27.720]  tyranny and and ron emmanuel said his white house
[03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:30.680]  uh chief of staff remember we played the video like 20 times i won't play it
[03:12:30.680 --> 03:12:33.320]  again folks but i'll play a ton of the news when you have time
[03:12:33.320 --> 03:12:36.600]  he said ron he said we're just going to put you on a list now where you can't
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:40.200]  own a gun if we say so i mean it's totally dictatorial
[03:12:40.200 --> 03:12:44.200]  and these idiot obama supporters don't understand they could already get free
[03:12:44.200 --> 03:12:47.400]  health care under the emergency clauses of state law
[03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:50.520]  again my dad's a physician i've had physicians on they're that ignorant the
[03:12:50.520 --> 03:12:54.040]  illegal aliens knew it they don't even know it doesn't give them
[03:12:54.040 --> 03:12:57.240]  that and it gets rid of pre-existing conditions doesn't
[03:12:57.240 --> 03:13:01.640]  doesn't cover that and it's doubling the premiums as reported
[03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:07.160]  uh by etna and others i mean this is the folks the screw job is going into light
[03:13:07.160 --> 03:13:10.520]  speed right now ron ron what do you see happening i mean
[03:13:10.520 --> 03:13:14.840]  i've talked about my trepidation what i feel not just what i see
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:17.960]  is your spidey sense telling you get ready for the hammer
[03:13:17.960 --> 03:13:21.720]  well yeah my spidey sense has been telling me that for the last few years
[03:13:21.720 --> 03:13:25.720]  and i'm going to tell you right now the second they start to organize medical
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:30.600]  records into a law enforcement database the national police database the fbi
[03:13:30.600 --> 03:13:33.800]  you are going to be in for big problems it's going to impact your second
[03:13:33.800 --> 03:13:38.120]  amendment rights but you are you are kidding yourself if you think it stops
[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:42.600]  there this will metastasize like a cancer that metastasizes
[03:13:42.600 --> 03:13:46.520]  and reach out into other areas of social history has gone
[03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:51.240]  has grown tenfold and the information will be passed along there
[03:13:51.240 --> 03:13:54.920]  the bottom line is this is eugenic in nature there's no doubt about the
[03:13:54.920 --> 03:13:58.440]  parallels in history are exact and we should really be
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:02.280]  speaking out about this and this was already on the back burner for the last
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:05.080]  year he was just waiting for the right opportunity
[03:14:05.080 --> 03:14:09.400]  oh he hadn't facing a reelection it is hammered down folks
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:13.480]  uh you'll just like jamie fox said hey second term
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:16.760]  yeah it's the black side we're going to kill you white people
[03:14:16.760 --> 03:14:21.160]  and again it's an attempt to get a race war going if you oppose giving your
[03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:25.720]  guns up your kuklux klan if you oppose communism your kuklux klan
[03:14:25.720 --> 03:14:29.880]  they're using the exact communist model foreign megabanks
[03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:32.840]  are going to use communism to collectivize our wealth
[03:14:32.840 --> 03:14:37.160]  and conduit it offshore uh ron else here alex too
[03:14:37.160 --> 03:14:40.520]  as it concerns the nra all right i don't want to
[03:14:40.520 --> 03:14:43.480]  really pounce on them but i'm going to say something
[03:14:43.480 --> 03:14:46.920]  that i think people need to keep their radar up with that organization
[03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:50.360]  all right and i think they need to contact them and let's just say give them
[03:14:50.360 --> 03:14:52.760]  a little encouragement to do the right thing because
[03:14:52.760 --> 03:14:57.960]  the nra has gone into the tank with uh with certain political elements they
[03:14:57.960 --> 03:15:00.440]  shouldn't in the past and you and i have discussed that
[03:15:00.440 --> 03:15:04.360]  such as the 2007 so-called nicks improvement act which is anything but
[03:15:04.360 --> 03:15:08.120]  an improvement now today in today's new york times
[03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:11.880]  there's a report there that from the kato institute brain trust
[03:15:11.880 --> 03:15:16.120]  which is referred to as a a right-wing brain trust of some sort
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:19.880]  there's more or less than diplomatic double talk and of course the kato
[03:15:19.880 --> 03:15:23.480]  institute and there's some connection no no no the republicans are going to cave
[03:15:23.480 --> 03:15:27.400]  in on inheritance taxes on all the new vat on
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:31.480]  investment everything because they're because it's a globalist agenda is that
[03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:34.600]  what you're about to say i didn't read the kato report they the republicans
[03:15:34.600 --> 03:15:39.400]  are bending us over right now finish my remark the kato report
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:44.200]  more or less indicated that we should sort of go we should go along on this
[03:15:44.200 --> 03:15:46.760]  thing of turning medical records over to the fbi
[03:15:46.760 --> 03:15:50.040]  that if there's something that needs to be sacrificed for the sake of something
[03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:53.480]  else that that's the thing that they know i knew it i gotta jump to other
[03:15:53.480 --> 03:15:58.680]  callers no i knew it no no the republican signals are
[03:15:59.320 --> 03:16:02.520]  come on bring us down i mean they're bought and paid for that we're following
[03:16:02.520 --> 03:16:05.880]  a global plan they've done this in other countries but that's why i know
[03:16:05.880 --> 03:16:08.920]  the next phase it's going to be hammered down folks they're going to stage
[03:16:08.920 --> 03:16:11.560]  terror attacks and layman on us they're going to just it's going to be
[03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:15.640]  battling they'll probably release a bio weapon uh who knows how bad it'll be it's
[03:16:15.640 --> 03:16:19.480]  just get prayed to god is all i can say because let me tell you something i i
[03:16:19.480 --> 03:16:21.560]  would not be up here on air i would be
[03:16:21.560 --> 03:16:25.400]  hightailing it to ireland or switzerland not that they're perfect
[03:16:25.400 --> 03:16:28.120]  but i would be you know doing the show every day from from from a studio in
[03:16:28.120 --> 03:16:33.400]  europe only because i'm a target here if i wasn't trusting in god right now

[03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:41.160]  gone boom i mean this is a real tyranny this is an evil
[03:16:41.160 --> 03:16:45.000]  illegitimate government that's built reeducation camps and bought 1.6
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:48.280]  billion bullets okay ron good to hear from you great
[03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:52.200]  points uh let's talk to gio in wisconsin go ahead gio

[03:16:56.200 --> 03:16:59.560]  um i just want to make a couple points i
[03:16:59.560 --> 03:17:02.680]  especially against the uh zombie propaganda
[03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:05.960]  uh you end up watching any of these series on tv now
[03:17:05.960 --> 03:17:11.080]  uh whatever they're killing a child a zombie child they put it so it's okay
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:15.560]  they slow it down you know they drag it out drag it out more than the other
[03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:19.640]  you know adult zombies no no that's the new fetish is killing children they
[03:17:19.640 --> 03:17:22.280]  use zombies as a pretext to show cops milling down
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:26.440]  citizens getting you ready for civil war collapse it chooses a simulant to
[03:17:26.440 --> 03:17:30.440]  prepare the mind absolutely and you know the second
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:34.840]  thing i did the n r a back in the day banned human uh human
[03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:39.240]  shaped target that gun ranges yes the n r a was founded by the by the
[03:17:39.240 --> 03:17:43.320]  arming after the civil war because northerners couldn't shoot as good as
[03:17:43.320 --> 03:17:47.960]  southerners because they were more uh were uh urban uh and the n r a has
[03:17:47.960 --> 03:17:51.640]  been a judo scott organization according to larry pratt and others and i
[03:17:51.640 --> 03:17:54.440]  agree with them uh until recently they've gotten a
[03:17:54.440 --> 03:17:57.240]  better board and uh we're gonna have an n r a board
[03:17:57.240 --> 03:18:00.520]  member on in a couple days i'll just leave it at that uh we've had many of
[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:03.640]  their board members on uh but we need to keep the n r a
[03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:07.240]  honest thank you so much for the call great point uh let's talk to mike in
[03:18:07.240 --> 03:18:12.440]  tennessee mike you ready to turn your guns in because obama says he loves you
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:16.840]  well if you remember back in 1800s they used the demonization of the wolves in
[03:18:16.840 --> 03:18:20.360]  this country to carry out what was a cultural genocide against native
[03:18:20.360 --> 03:18:23.480]  americans who at that time were occupating you know
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:28.120]  mineral rich lands yeah they're now demonizing patriots killing people and
[03:18:28.120 --> 03:18:31.560]  they put a bounty on the wolves and they started the extermination
[03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:34.440]  well then when the people were conditioned to kill in something that had
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:38.440]  never killed anybody in this country they accuse native americans of
[03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:44.520]  invading is that sir is that a wolf well that's my doorbell yes he's uh he
[03:18:44.520 --> 03:18:50.200]  hears something but uh yes um sorry about that
[03:18:50.200 --> 03:18:54.440]  but anyway they utilize this creature to demonize
[03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:58.200]  another group of creature so i'm gonna let you go
[03:18:58.200 --> 03:19:00.840]  well i'll put you on hold i gotta find out what's going on that's a prank call
[03:19:00.840 --> 03:19:03.640]  or whatever anyway that didn't sound like a wolf to
[03:19:03.640 --> 03:19:07.960]  me anyways yes they're saying gun owners think
[03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:11.640]  of how asinine that is gun owners you're the clan
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:14.920]  gun owners you need to die you know already needs to have their director
[03:19:14.920 --> 03:19:17.960]  killed that's in the news right now they were like that's right let's kill them
[03:19:17.960 --> 03:19:22.600]  with guns yeah uh and and again this is the new
[03:19:22.600 --> 03:19:26.840]  thing demonize gun owners demonize them because it's their last gas
[03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:30.200]  the gun culture is beginning to percolate up and win
[03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:35.880]  and so they're panicking and are going to seize on anything they can
[03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:40.120]  we're gonna get a quick update after uh this break

[03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:21.240]  jones matt williams i don't know about a year ago he said watch they're going to
[03:24:21.240 --> 03:24:25.960]  ban these semi-auto shotguns imported from russia
[03:24:25.960 --> 03:24:29.640]  boom they banned it uh atf same they're going to ban most shotguns anything
[03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:33.240]  that's bottom loaded they just say they don't need laws they just make a rule
[03:24:33.240 --> 03:24:37.640]  and they're announcing executive action on our guns matt you've got a lot of gun
[03:24:37.640 --> 03:24:40.680]  shop connections you've got connections into law enforcement
[03:24:40.680 --> 03:24:43.960]  and uh you also teach concealed carry classes
[03:24:43.960 --> 03:24:48.040]  this is a short segment tell people what to expect with the un treaty and the
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:51.560]  rest of it basically like i was telling you earlier expect
[03:24:51.560 --> 03:24:57.000]  clinton revisited but tsa style i they're going to go after a wider spectrum
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:25:00.360]  of weapons they're going to go after more than just weapons but magazines
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:04.680]  included they'll also probably go after ammunition
[03:25:04.680 --> 03:25:08.440]  in some degree the un small arms treaty is actually focused
[03:25:08.440 --> 03:25:12.680]  towards those kind of importations a lot of people think that un small arms
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:15.160]  treaty is going to go after the guns it has nothing to do with going after the
[03:25:15.160 --> 03:25:17.880]  guns they own it has to do with all importation of guns
[03:25:17.880 --> 03:25:21.240]  and by the way they don't they've already as you were saying sold out of
[03:25:21.240 --> 03:25:25.480]  almost every assault weapon made uh they're uh the distributors are emptied
[03:25:25.480 --> 03:25:28.760]  out they're waiting for manufacturers i went but i thought people were conspiracy
[03:25:28.760 --> 03:25:32.200]  theorists that they that they were going to restrict our guns yeah well you know
[03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:36.200]  uh it's honestly is brutal you know at the end of the day some what are the
[03:25:36.200 --> 03:25:39.720]  gun shops like now tell me what you told me it takes an hour just to get
[03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:43.000]  to a hello from a sales representative to get a gun
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:46.680]  thankfully i know a lot of people in the area and i sort of you know
[03:25:46.680 --> 03:25:50.680]  whittle around my my way and get what i need but
[03:25:50.680 --> 03:25:53.560]  it's a rush it's been a panic since the election
[03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:58.120]  this has just made them all quiet you go into a gun shop and instead of like
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:02.840]  a lot of jovial uh you know fellowship of gun owners now you have a whole bunch
[03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:06.200]  of people who are almost made to feel ashamed of buying a gun
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:09.000]  i think it's more than that i think it's dawning on people that we've got real
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:12.440]  authoritarians in charge absolutely i mean it's hammer down and you watch
[03:26:12.440 --> 03:26:16.600]  how mindless obama supporters are they're going i get something free
[03:26:16.600 --> 03:26:19.480]  and i'm like it's going to double your insurance you idiot it's one of my
[03:26:19.480 --> 03:26:22.680]  biggest and they're so stupid well well they're going to go after mindlessly
[03:26:22.680 --> 03:26:25.560]  after our guns too i mean like you said they're going to go after pump action
[03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:29.000]  shock they're saying you're the clan if you have guns yeah their hate group or
[03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:31.880]  something to that effect you'll be criminalized everyone thinks that you
[03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:34.040]  know when guns are banned they're going to come knocking on the door
[03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:37.640]  would never happen you would lose 50 percent of law enforcement on day one
[03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:40.200]  whether they get okay no it's going to be incremental
[03:26:40.200 --> 03:26:43.480]  swat teaming saying the person was planning something they're going to call
[03:26:43.480 --> 03:26:46.040]  it terror absolutely they're going to go terrorist because i've seen all the
[03:26:46.040 --> 03:26:49.400]  drills with the military the last decade it's always about a veteran wouldn't
[03:26:49.400 --> 03:26:53.080]  turn the guns in he made a threat uh so if they're just going to round us up
[03:26:53.080 --> 03:26:55.800]  incrementally or the state police pull you over
[03:26:55.800 --> 03:26:59.240]  for a broken tell i oh sorry sir come with us you're on a pickup list
[03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:02.520]  that's all admitted yeah well one of the things i listen to you talk a lot about
[03:27:02.520 --> 03:27:06.600]  is the red flag events and i can easily see you know that we have nicks
[03:27:06.600 --> 03:27:09.640]  uh background checks system set up throughout the entire country you know
[03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:13.000]  this is supposed to cover for criminals this is supposed to cover for mentally
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:17.480]  what they call mentally defective people um a whole host of people
[03:27:17.480 --> 03:27:21.320]  it's easy to overlook these kind of checks and just allow things to happen
[03:27:21.320 --> 03:27:25.000]  and that's where i start seeing a lot of what's going on compared to your red
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:29.080]  flag events is you know the system that's
[03:27:29.080 --> 03:27:34.200]  put into place isn't being turned on and it's giving them the excuse because
[03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:37.480]  under hard times people are doing crazy stuff like this
[03:27:37.480 --> 03:27:40.440]  it's going to happen and they know it so they allow it to happen and ultimately
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:43.480]  gives them opportunity to create these new laws and new bills and new bans and
[03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:48.840]  new regulation and job security for big government and just gets crazy
[03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:51.640]  do you think they'll be able to ram through because they're saying they want
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:55.560]  physically people to turn them in that's not uh so so they're asking for a
[03:27:55.560 --> 03:27:58.680]  million miles hoping to get a five hundred thousand right
[03:27:58.680 --> 03:28:02.440]  right um there there's definitely going to be a band assault rifles uh are
[03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:06.840]  going to take a huge hit importation if you see any kind of assault rifle
[03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:10.520]  quote unquote come in from overseas forget about it that
[03:28:10.520 --> 03:28:13.400]  they're going to go after that and they'll probably get that um one of the
[03:28:13.400 --> 03:28:15.880]  things that's going to be said a precedence is they'll probably go after
[03:28:15.880 --> 03:28:19.160]  the m4 which has been common you commonly use it was used in the
[03:28:19.160 --> 03:28:22.920]  school shooting as well as the colorado shooting same type weapon type
[03:28:22.920 --> 03:28:26.360]  um it'll set a precedence because it'll be the first time that the government
[03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:30.120]  goes after a u.s. army-issued weapon i mean you're
[03:28:30.120 --> 03:28:34.680]  talking about the semi-automatic uh copy of a cult the bush master that used
[03:28:34.680 --> 03:28:37.400]  yes yeah absolutely um but that would be like
[03:28:37.400 --> 03:28:41.800]  then going after a 1903 springfield or a m1 grand or a m1a that is a
[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:45.320]  representation of the m14 that we used in korean vietnam
[03:28:45.320 --> 03:28:48.440]  so this is the first time they're actually going to go after
[03:28:48.440 --> 03:28:51.800]  guns that are made here in america well you notice they're dumping the medical
[03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:55.160]  records in now so they're just going to say oh you
[03:28:55.160 --> 03:28:58.440]  went to a psychologist once you can't own a gun well they have a lot of that
[03:28:58.440 --> 03:29:01.720]  already up that's part of the nicks um the medical advisory board for each
[03:29:01.720 --> 03:29:05.240]  state actually has this you're as a physician if you
[03:29:05.240 --> 03:29:08.520]  have anyone that you're prescribing certain drugs to or whether
[03:29:08.520 --> 03:29:12.040]  it be psychotropic drugs or painkillers or sedatives
[03:29:12.040 --> 03:29:15.640]  you have to report and by the way he was refused we now learn not three
[03:29:15.640 --> 03:29:20.040]  five times he tried to get guns well he got him from his mom
[03:29:20.040 --> 03:29:23.560]  at this point from what i hear if you even believe any of this

[03:33:33.160 --> 03:33:37.240]  this is a totally coordinated psi off against the second amendment that
[03:33:37.240 --> 03:33:39.960]  literally kicked off the starting of this country when they came to take the
[03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:43.000]  guns texas was founded when santa anna come to take the
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:46.440]  guns from what david air is one of my ancestors
[03:33:46.440 --> 03:33:49.240]  you know the same story over and over again
[03:33:49.240 --> 03:33:52.200]  and here's the deal people aren't going to turn them in
[03:33:52.200 --> 03:33:55.320]  they're going to try to use the new homeland security paramilitary force
[03:33:55.320 --> 03:33:58.840]  because the real training is all about american gun owners gun owners returning
[03:33:58.840 --> 03:34:02.040]  veterans constitutionalists that's in all the homeland security
[03:34:02.040 --> 03:34:04.920]  documents matt i want to go back to calls here but
[03:34:04.920 --> 03:34:08.440]  looking at the architecture of this the good news is we've reached out to so many
[03:34:08.440 --> 03:34:11.560]  police they're starting to wake up but again they use
[03:34:11.560 --> 03:34:15.320]  events like this as psi ops to just super charge i mean when
[03:34:15.320 --> 03:34:20.040]  they're putting on fox sports and nbc news that gun owners are quote
[03:34:20.040 --> 03:34:23.960]  kook lux clan need to be killed when they are i mean this is some vicious
[03:34:23.960 --> 03:34:27.320]  rhetoric people got to get back in the face of this you were telling me off
[03:34:27.320 --> 03:34:30.040]  air well i mean tell folks what you told me off air about that
[03:34:30.040 --> 03:34:33.240]  well i mean you know a lot of these individuals a lot of the shootings that
[03:34:33.240 --> 03:34:35.960]  have been happening throughout the year you know they're hitting high schools
[03:34:35.960 --> 03:34:39.880]  in some cases movie theaters things like that and it's horrible
[03:34:39.880 --> 03:34:43.720]  but when you hit an end and you hit one of our nurseries where our
[03:34:43.720 --> 03:34:48.040]  children were innocent lives just completely
[03:34:48.040 --> 03:34:50.920]  it's just pure evil well that's punching the programming of a mammal
[03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:53.960]  absolutely it doesn't matter what your beliefs are what your stance is it
[03:34:53.960 --> 03:34:56.840]  impacts you everyone is hurting right now because of this you know about
[03:34:56.840 --> 03:34:59.640]  operation gladio when our government targeted
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:02.600]  children in europe as a pretext to demonize their political enemies and
[03:35:02.600 --> 03:35:06.120]  they frame bats he said no i wasn't aware of that what am i sorry go ahead
[03:35:06.120 --> 03:35:09.640]  um but yeah now it's gotten to a point where
[03:35:09.640 --> 03:35:13.560]  you're even having pro gunners sort of laying down their arms saying you know
[03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:16.920]  what a band at least is worthy of talking about
[03:35:16.920 --> 03:35:19.640]  so as you said and then there'll be more shootings and they'll give up more more
[03:35:19.640 --> 03:35:23.000]  more there's a blueprint to this absolutely if you i looked at a list
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:27.320]  the other day on yahoo news and it was a list of a timeline for 2012 shooting
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:29.800]  and one of the shootings they put in there was the empire state building
[03:35:29.800 --> 03:35:31.880]  shooting the one that was started by the cops
[03:35:31.880 --> 03:35:36.040]  the ones with the cops shot nine people and the other guy was trying to get away
[03:35:36.040 --> 03:35:39.960]  um that's a whole nother oh no they say yeah no that's the nation
[03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:43.400]  magazine and and the justice department 88 dead
[03:35:43.400 --> 03:35:47.960]  most of them gang related 30 something real mass shootings
[03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:51.880]  deer killed 200 people yeah but again it's it's irrational
[03:35:51.880 --> 03:35:55.320]  it's like when the media says this is what you're supposed to do they just say
[03:35:55.320 --> 03:35:58.760]  open my wrist it's the same thing you're a racist if you don't like obama care

[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:43.080]  they were kept well exactly but i mean you have their
[03:36:43.080 --> 03:36:47.080]  mainstream people who are just part of the game who are just laying it down
[03:36:47.080 --> 03:36:49.480]  saying you know it's just done and done in such
[03:36:49.480 --> 03:36:52.120]  poor taste i have no defense for herself because it's such a horrible
[03:36:52.120 --> 03:36:54.360]  incident and it's like you did this gun owners
[03:36:54.360 --> 03:36:58.280]  yeah we're supposed to go okay here's my guns we're being blamed for doing this
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:01.080]  i didn't want to be in the clan because i own guns

[03:37:12.680 --> 03:37:16.840]  yes sir right now it's apparently a good tactic it's been working for a
[03:37:16.840 --> 03:37:21.080]  couple decades okay give me your watch or you're a racist

[03:37:37.880 --> 03:37:42.040]  he proved he's not a racist good you've proven yourself
[03:37:42.040 --> 03:37:45.080]  yeah anyways that's what they're doing sorry
[03:37:45.080 --> 03:37:48.680]  uh no it's it's to the point where they're just kicking us in the t
[03:37:48.680 --> 03:37:52.520]  did you see obama's fate crying yeah i didn't understand why he was trying to
[03:37:52.520 --> 03:37:56.920]  flick his tears out in the audience well no no no no no well at first it was
[03:37:56.920 --> 03:38:00.680]  um um it was just so i'll be honest if i was in his
[03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:04.440]  position there'd be i it'd be like a waterfall i would god that would be i
[03:38:04.440 --> 03:38:07.080]  couldn't imagine having to go and talk to all those families and then be put on
[03:38:07.080 --> 03:38:09.880]  tv it's like in spies like us when they're caught
[03:38:09.880 --> 03:38:14.280]  cheating in the in the exam right and they're going heart attack
[03:38:14.280 --> 03:38:20.120]  they're falling down like excuse me pin please exactly
[03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:24.360]  yeah no um it was it was well scripted
[03:38:24.360 --> 03:38:27.800]  but that's what happens when you vote in paid actors you know
[03:38:27.800 --> 03:38:32.440]  well obama actually really cares about us that's why these idiots have no idea
[03:38:32.440 --> 03:38:34.920]  well anyways let's i want to go to phone calls but
[03:38:34.920 --> 03:38:38.680]  here's the deal we better get organized because they're going to take
[03:38:38.680 --> 03:38:41.080]  everything you've got a lot of people are like well i'll turn my guns in i don't
[03:38:41.080 --> 03:38:43.800]  care they want the guns because politically
[03:38:43.800 --> 03:38:46.440]  they're going to do things so horrible they know that's going to cause a
[03:38:46.440 --> 03:38:50.120]  response well i mean if you want to just a quick briefing what to look for if
[03:38:50.120 --> 03:38:53.320]  you're going to go out and buy stuff is anything that's imported that can hold
[03:38:53.320 --> 03:38:57.240]  10 rounds or more um any kind of nato caliber ammo
[03:38:57.240 --> 03:39:03.480]  whether it be 9 millimeter 5.56 um also the 7.62 which is nato caliber
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:08.200]  rounds um and in retrospect also the soviet ammo 5.45
[03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:12.360]  millimeter by 39 as well 7.62 by 39 all all those
[03:39:12.360 --> 03:39:16.760]  importations are going at risk uh any kind of gun that's manufactured
[03:39:16.760 --> 03:39:19.320]  that is capable of holding 10 or more rounds
[03:39:19.320 --> 03:39:23.480]  within the next six months are going to be at risk state side the m4 if you're
[03:39:23.480 --> 03:39:26.760]  ever interested in owning a m4 type military type for those that don't know
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:31.320]  that's an m16 semi-auto yeah it's a m4 while there's m16 second one be the
[03:39:31.320 --> 03:39:34.840]  m16a2 then the m16a3 and then they designated the m6
[03:39:34.840 --> 03:39:38.520]  m4 but yes that's basically a eugene stoner design
[03:39:38.520 --> 03:39:41.400]  if you want one buy one because they're not going to be around long
[03:39:41.400 --> 03:39:46.360]  um shotguns anything semi-automatic any by the way it is the ar-15 that that
[03:39:46.360 --> 03:39:50.280]  witch uh feinstein and is holding up going we're
[03:39:50.280 --> 03:39:53.160]  gonna get this i'll get you and your little dog too
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:56.040]  she's been carrying a gun since she's been talking about not carrying a gun
[03:39:56.040 --> 03:39:59.400]  she's been carrying she's it's been on record yeah she's a chl holder
[03:39:59.400 --> 03:40:02.440]  she's a pig yeah she's a slob she's basically
[03:40:02.440 --> 03:40:07.800]  let me ask this question israel gets our tax money to put m16s in lockers in
[03:40:07.800 --> 03:40:11.480]  all the classrooms so uh the the palestinians you know know the
[03:40:11.480 --> 03:40:15.160]  target of school why why can the pal why can the israelis have
[03:40:15.160 --> 03:40:18.600]  m16s in schools but we can't that's what pigstein should be asked
[03:40:18.600 --> 03:40:22.200]  i think they give their kids a medal for participating and at the same time it's
[03:40:22.200 --> 03:40:26.120]  as i said the generation has been spanked so that's what we face
[03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:30.440]  we have a lot of americans who frankly in the last 30 or so years have just become
[03:40:30.440 --> 03:40:33.720]  weak and it's been something with the mentality and the the
[03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:36.280]  environment but i mean they know right now have the
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:40.200]  sheriff train and deputize whoever wants to be in the school
[03:40:40.200 --> 03:40:44.840]  and then that's the end of it um that would be logical to actually
[03:40:44.840 --> 03:40:48.040]  implement a deputy officer i went to a really bad high school so we actually
[03:40:48.040 --> 03:40:51.960]  had a substation in our high school um didn't stop shootings didn't stop
[03:40:51.960 --> 03:40:56.280]  sabbings and didn't stop drug activity so you were in uh what was it miama or
[03:40:56.280 --> 03:40:59.640]  south miami you know south ridge senior high it was uh
[03:40:59.640 --> 03:41:03.160]  it was back in the 80s in south florida so it had its problems all together
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:06.360]  e Howard hunt always called it miama so that's why i call it my grandma called
[03:41:06.360 --> 03:41:11.320]  it that she's from texas miama miama
[03:41:11.320 --> 03:41:14.200]  let's go ahead and go to some phone calls here let's talk to uh who's been
[03:41:14.200 --> 03:41:17.720]  holding the longest rob and pennsylvania you're on the air are you looking
[03:41:17.720 --> 03:41:23.320]  forward to turning your gun in because obama cares about the children

[03:41:45.160 --> 03:41:51.880]  i'm sad for the victims uh i also wanted to say or ask questions about you know

[03:41:55.640 --> 03:41:58.920]  or come for my neighbor's guns i mean what are we supposed to do are we
[03:41:58.920 --> 03:42:02.280]  prove you're a good citizen and go down in the pit like they did in nazi
[03:42:02.280 --> 03:42:04.680]  germany and just open your shirt up and say please
[03:42:04.680 --> 03:42:08.440]  please kill me i mean that's what a patriot does as you turn your guns in
[03:42:08.440 --> 03:42:12.040]  and you worship communism i mean that's freedom sir
[03:42:12.040 --> 03:42:15.960]  no i mean we fight politically now to expose this illegitimate government
[03:42:15.960 --> 03:42:19.240]  and we make them fight for every inch we've been reversing them
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:22.360]  on the second amendment that's why they've been so desperate
[03:42:22.360 --> 03:42:25.960]  and are coming after the guns now and are going to do it in an authoritarian
[03:42:25.960 --> 03:42:29.880]  fashion the gun culture's been winning all the women's magazines are women with
[03:42:29.880 --> 03:42:34.040]  guns now and shooting uh matt talk about that i mean hasn't the
[03:42:34.040 --> 03:42:36.600]  gun culture been the only beachhead of liberty left
[03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:39.400]  it really has been because once you take that away you can kiss your first
[03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:42.280]  amendment but i mean we that's that's where we've been gaining ground the
[03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:45.480]  gun culture's been taking over yeah i mean it's a but a steady
[03:42:45.480 --> 03:42:50.200]  decline of support of any kind of anti-gun measures ever since 1968
[03:42:50.200 --> 03:42:53.640]  it's been you know went from like 76 percent or 72 percent and dropped all
[03:42:53.640 --> 03:42:56.440]  the way down now we're currently at an anti-gun culture
[03:42:56.440 --> 03:42:59.640]  of only like 36 or 37 that's right wow you know your stuff
[03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:02.840]  that's right but then they're gonna try this hoax of oh it's a mandate everyone
[03:43:02.840 --> 03:43:04.760]  wants to turn their guns in the polls don't show that
[03:43:04.760 --> 03:43:07.800]  absolutely the point is you're not getting our gun dirtbags
[03:43:07.800 --> 03:43:10.360]  you're voting you're voting for someone they're getting into office and then
[03:43:10.360 --> 03:43:13.720]  ultimately they just joined the good old boys club and they're sitting there and
[03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:17.160]  the republicans are trial ballooning taking your guns not even the republicans
[03:43:17.160 --> 03:43:19.640]  it's not just a democrat no but i'm saying exactly but i'm the
[03:43:19.640 --> 03:43:22.680]  democrats are the are the tip of the spear and i'm saying there's only a few
[03:43:22.680 --> 03:43:26.440]  republicans speaking out like gohmert of texas they're like how dare you say
[03:43:26.440 --> 03:43:30.200]  i'm the teachers that's insane when i keep on seeing
[03:43:30.200 --> 03:43:33.320]  you know laws being passed and how they explain how laws are being passed and
[03:43:33.320 --> 03:43:37.400]  how it goes from one you know legislation over to another legislation
[03:43:37.400 --> 03:43:41.560]  just don't believe it i adamantly think feel and have seen
[03:43:41.560 --> 03:43:45.000]  certain things been done and handled like a drug deal to the point where they're
[03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:49.560]  just handing over money to get stuff done and that's exactly exactly and they
[03:43:49.560 --> 03:43:53.880]  want our guns so they can really take our freedom and if they had any good taste
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:43:57.640]  about them they would at least allow a time to mourn these poor children that
[03:43:57.640 --> 03:44:00.280]  died no they jump right on it into it with obama
[03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:03.880]  like a wolf wanting to use those kids let's say the names now
[03:44:03.880 --> 03:44:07.000]  hopefully their lives will mean something by getting the guns and what i
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:11.480]  read on one of the reports is that the mother has actually was
[03:44:11.480 --> 03:44:15.160]  state required to go through a parenting education course now if that was the
[03:44:15.160 --> 03:44:18.360]  case that should red flag them on nix she had three
[03:44:18.360 --> 03:44:21.880]  guns she had an assault rifle she had two handguns nix is supposed to pick up
[03:44:21.880 --> 03:44:25.640]  stuff like that how come it didn't look it's ridiculous
[03:44:25.640 --> 03:44:29.800]  it's totally ridiculous that's the fb i they are the fourth strongest state on
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:34.680]  gun control well and ironically it's where most of them are manufactured
[03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:38.840]  can advocate well here's the deal you better let the gun lobby know we want
[03:44:38.840 --> 03:44:41.960]  absolute defense of the second amendment number one i've shown the statistic
[03:44:41.960 --> 03:44:44.520]  like five times i've got it right here in my stack
[03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:48.600]  you have a almost three times better chance of dying from a deer
[03:44:48.600 --> 03:44:51.800]  jumping in front of your car than from a gun in a mass shooting give a better
[03:44:51.800 --> 03:44:54.840]  chance to be shot by cop than dying in a mass shooting
[03:44:54.840 --> 03:44:58.200]  yeah i mean it's it's crazy yeah it's crazy
[03:44:58.200 --> 03:45:02.200]  listen the cop that got killed at walmart here the guy was on a bunch of
[03:45:02.200 --> 03:45:04.760]  psychotropic it came out later they always are
[03:45:04.760 --> 03:45:07.560]  i mean a cop just walks in you just shoot him for no reason there of course
[03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:10.440]  they're whacked out of their brain even if you're an evil person you're going to
[03:45:10.440 --> 03:45:12.440]  get killed or go to jail
[03:45:12.440 --> 03:45:16.120]  these people when some sergeant climbs the wall at night and goes and kills 16
[03:45:16.120 --> 03:45:19.640]  people i said he'll be on drugs turned out psychotropic steroids
[03:45:19.640 --> 03:45:22.600]  and that malaria drug that they took off the market because it makes you crazy
[03:45:22.600 --> 03:45:25.160]  you know the more i keep looking at everything and hearing everything and
[03:45:25.160 --> 03:45:28.120]  seeing all these reports coming in different types of violence whether it
[03:45:28.120 --> 03:45:31.000]  be done by this person or that person
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:34.440]  you know i i sometimes feel bad because i become part of the problem and
[03:45:34.440 --> 03:45:37.160]  turn into a zombie and walk into my house and just close the door because i
[03:45:37.160 --> 03:45:40.120]  just i just want quiet yeah well you know what these
[03:45:40.120 --> 03:45:43.880]  globalists aren't getting our guns no no no and and we got larry proud on tomorrow
[03:45:43.880 --> 03:45:45.960]  we're going to stop them let's go to george in canada
[03:45:45.960 --> 03:45:49.560]  kid george you're on the air go ahead sir
[03:45:49.560 --> 03:45:53.240]  there i have a personal collection but before i wanted uh wanted to go into
[03:45:53.240 --> 03:45:57.320]  that but the incident uh i want to make some suggestions why don't we
[03:45:57.320 --> 03:46:00.920]  ask some of your uh listeners in israel to do
[03:46:00.920 --> 03:46:04.600]  interviews over there what they do in the similar surface circumstances in
[03:46:04.600 --> 03:46:08.920]  schools have videos and also maybe in switzerland where everybody's packing
[03:46:08.920 --> 03:46:12.040]  guns what they do there which i have swiss friends and i'm
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:16.120]  i have swiss heritage and see how many incidents they have the lowest crime
[03:46:16.120 --> 03:46:18.120]  rate in in europe and one of the lowest in the
[03:46:18.120 --> 03:46:22.600]  world and the answer is everyone by law is required to have full auto and then
[03:46:22.600 --> 03:46:26.120]  they've all got underground bases with hangar nades and rocket launchers
[03:46:26.120 --> 03:46:30.520]  and no one would dare invade them and then take those videos
[03:46:30.520 --> 03:46:33.480]  and with people that there are millions of listeners
[03:46:33.480 --> 03:46:37.880]  send them to every one of these these cowards like like schumer or whatever
[03:46:37.880 --> 03:46:41.640]  and and send them to them and and send them things well if this is what we
[03:46:41.640 --> 03:46:44.920]  want we want real protection not disarmament
[03:46:44.920 --> 03:46:48.840]  and on the other thing is you should cook up with with people who are
[03:46:48.840 --> 03:46:51.400]  basically uh uh going against us and saying look
[03:46:51.400 --> 03:46:54.920]  is the drug thing uh gary knoll which is out of new york
[03:46:54.920 --> 03:46:59.320]  and and uh and california your friend uh the the what is it the
[03:46:59.320 --> 03:47:02.520]  the health uh the health range or whatever he is he has a connection with
[03:47:02.520 --> 03:47:05.880]  him he was he had a he was talking about this about 15 minutes
[03:47:05.880 --> 03:47:09.560]  uh blaming liberal really good guy but he was saying look
[03:47:09.560 --> 03:47:13.560]  95 percent of these incidents all around the world have been proven that
[03:47:13.560 --> 03:47:17.000]  when they shoot up people and kids and things like that they were all drug
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:21.000]  related why aren't we up focusing on the drugs no no i agree we need to say
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:24.760]  listen you come after our guns this is a war against the serotonin reuptake
[03:47:24.760 --> 03:47:28.440]  inhibitors listen they're trying to make 50 percent of the kids going the drugs
[03:47:28.440 --> 03:47:32.680]  now that's under new freedom initiative and and then look suicide is rising the
[03:47:32.680 --> 03:47:36.440]  more people go on these drugs because it says on the insert makes you commit
[03:47:36.440 --> 03:47:39.880]  suicide we're giving people suicide pills
[03:47:39.880 --> 03:47:43.320]  our homicide pills um well they do that too it's rubber shantics
[03:47:43.320 --> 03:47:47.000]  yeah okay well i i quit smoking the first on the first time um when i quit
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:51.000]  smoking i did it on shantics but i would be in situations where literally i mean
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:54.280]  i'm not even describe how i lost my temper but i was losing my temper
[03:47:54.280 --> 03:47:56.920]  and then one day i was watching a commercial and it says oh may cause
[03:47:56.920 --> 03:48:02.120]  psychotic episodes may cause psychotic no no no no all these ssri's and
[03:48:02.120 --> 03:48:05.640]  sri's they say psychotic episodes right they are
[03:48:05.640 --> 03:48:08.280]  murdered death kill pills right here let's give
[03:48:08.280 --> 03:48:11.800]  let's give everybody murdered death kill pills and then wonder why
[03:48:11.800 --> 03:48:16.120]  it's not 95 it's like 99 i was trying to find a case where there was a mass
[03:48:16.120 --> 03:48:18.440]  school shooting where they weren't on these drugs notice they try to keep it
[03:48:18.440 --> 03:48:20.600]  quiet now but you know he was under psychiatric care
[03:48:20.600 --> 03:48:25.320]  great point sir what was your other point okay so if you if you took that
[03:48:25.320 --> 03:48:29.000]  those two points that sort of mailing this to these people whether schumer
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:32.520]  whatever the reporters that are all trying to say we should disarm
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:35.560]  i think that the powerful point on the on the personal point of
[03:48:35.560 --> 03:48:38.520]  uh my best friend was actually dating one of the
[03:48:38.520 --> 03:48:42.040]  uh the kid up in that school they available
[03:48:42.040 --> 03:48:45.240]  they only a couple blocks away they could hear the hundreds of shots and
[03:48:45.240 --> 03:48:48.360]  things like that i mean i don't want to go into the trauma the poor poor woman
[03:48:48.360 --> 03:48:52.440]  had but the thing is if she was that close and she was armed don't you think
[03:48:52.440 --> 03:48:55.400]  she could have run the two blocks down the street and pop this guy if she
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:48:59.560]  i will guarantee you that if i heard gunshots coming out of school and i had
[03:48:59.560 --> 03:49:03.080]  a gun nearby there's no stop matt what would you have done if you were
[03:49:03.080 --> 03:49:06.600]  driving by and saw this i would have gone in anybody i mean anybody of
[03:49:06.600 --> 03:49:10.440]  decency would have gone in there even if you didn't have a gun what would you do
[03:49:10.440 --> 03:49:13.480]  if you were on the airplane and guys pulled box cutters out
[03:49:13.480 --> 03:49:17.080]  you know i would first probably cry because all the tsa stuff i had to go
[03:49:17.080 --> 03:49:20.440]  through to get on that damn plane but after that i would probably really
[03:49:20.440 --> 03:49:22.920]  lose my temper to the point where i would be what we call
[03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:27.000]  chemically unstable well i mean my point is is that i mean i've been in a while
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:29.320]  i'm not saying i'm a tough guy but i've been in a lot of big knockdown drag
[03:49:29.320 --> 03:49:32.600]  outs i know somebody pulls a knife on me i'm gonna stomp
[03:49:32.600 --> 03:49:36.040]  there i mean it's like oh you just pulled out a weapon you just gave me
[03:49:36.040 --> 03:49:39.880]  king kong power oh yeah because when people got weapons it's i mean i i it's
[03:49:39.880 --> 03:49:43.560]  cart blanche at this point i mean my issue is i got an initial office when i
[03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:46.280]  gotten fights with people my size i couldn't even they started it even i
[03:49:46.280 --> 03:49:49.480]  couldn't get going well a couple big guys attacking me look out man that's the
[03:49:49.480 --> 03:49:52.120]  thing we come from a generation where we were told hey never throw the first
[03:49:52.120 --> 03:49:55.480]  punch but you better to throw the last and you know just because they're that
[03:49:55.480 --> 03:49:58.120]  big they hit the ground that much harder so i mean
[03:49:58.120 --> 03:50:01.640]  yeah you pull out a gun or a knife i've been stabbed i've been shot at so let's
[03:50:01.640 --> 03:50:05.480]  go anyways great points sir appreciate your call

[03:55:08.840 --> 03:55:14.440]  i'd rather take self-imulation man i'm just out of control by the way
[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:17.960]  we went all over austin where we put 70 000 of these on the streets
[03:55:17.960 --> 03:55:22.200]  we had our distributor go to dozens and dozens and dozens of locations almost
[03:55:22.200 --> 03:55:26.440]  all of them were gone but we were able to get 3000 off the streets of austin
[03:55:26.440 --> 03:55:30.360]  because they're such a well these sold out we pulled the ones out of san
[03:55:30.360 --> 03:55:33.720]  antonio they sold out at cost this man wants your guns
[03:55:33.720 --> 03:55:38.440]  the december issue at cost in bulk there's 5000
[03:55:38.440 --> 03:55:41.480]  no no no 3000 left of those and then 600 they held back
[03:55:41.480 --> 03:55:45.240]  for a few more subscriptions i forget the point is welden henson just told us
[03:55:45.240 --> 03:55:48.600]  during the break how many do you say he said 3000 did i tell you the story about
[03:55:48.600 --> 03:55:51.000]  my daughter when she picked one of those up and brought one of those up no you
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:53.880]  didn't she comes home with one of those she throws it down on the table with
[03:55:53.880 --> 03:55:57.240]  that the cover pointing up and she's like look daddy
[03:55:57.240 --> 03:56:00.120]  still causing problems and that was two weeks ago
[03:56:00.120 --> 03:56:03.480]  she just turned nine but and my nine-year-old can recognize this and
[03:56:03.480 --> 03:56:06.600]  there's she can recognize the enemy yeah and there's over 50 percent of america
[03:56:06.600 --> 03:56:09.880]  they can't so don't you want to be collectivized
[03:56:09.880 --> 03:56:13.880]  i'm not gonna let her become that way no but the government loves you
[03:56:13.880 --> 03:56:17.240]  all those medical experiments on children those were done because they care
[03:56:17.240 --> 03:56:21.640]  about us okay so we got 3000 and uh 600 they pulled
[03:56:21.640 --> 03:56:24.280]  back to to sell as part of the subscription
[03:56:24.280 --> 03:56:27.480]  if you want it that way and for store.com let's fight these people
[03:56:27.480 --> 03:56:30.840]  let's expose them let's have our fighting spirit let's not give up the
[03:56:30.840 --> 03:56:33.880]  second amendment because lord obama said so and cried
[03:56:33.880 --> 03:56:37.240]  but he cried let's turn it in while he smart groans everybody
[03:56:37.240 --> 03:56:41.320]  ryan in california health care news go ahead
[03:56:41.320 --> 03:56:45.480]  yeah that obama thing was ridiculous uh thanks for taking my call
[03:56:45.480 --> 03:56:49.480]  i just wanted to let you know about a really disturbing uh trend that's been
[03:56:49.480 --> 03:56:53.800]  happening um peter sign i actually said as the president
[03:56:53.800 --> 03:56:57.560]  they've been denying um medical marijuana patients
[03:56:57.560 --> 03:57:02.360]  transplant uh and this whole this whole electronic health care records thing
[03:57:02.360 --> 03:57:05.880]  this really seems to be out of control oh yeah i saw that well this is the new
[03:57:05.880 --> 03:57:08.440]  system though you don't like the government having all your records and
[03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:12.200]  then mixing them with other databases i mean nixon almost went to jail for
[03:57:12.200 --> 03:57:15.640]  having health care records what's wrong with every agency having it it's
[03:57:15.640 --> 03:57:19.960]  freedom it's liberal what are you mad mit romney lost
[03:57:19.960 --> 03:57:23.480]  huh has nothing to do with anything they just say that

[03:57:48.920 --> 03:57:51.880]  whether whether or not they use medical marijuana for their
[03:57:51.880 --> 03:57:56.040]  medicare records so they're really trying to push down on it well listen i mean
