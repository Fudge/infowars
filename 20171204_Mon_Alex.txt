[00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:11.475]  This is our land.
[00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:16.257]  These are our people.
[00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:18.619]  The workers.
[00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.019]  The strivers.
[00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.720]  The builders.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.763]  These are our people.
[00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:31.126]  Who are they?
[00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:34.807]  They are the Dark Armies.
[00:00:34.807 --> 00:00:40.088]  The dark, murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[00:00:40.088 --> 00:00:42.008]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:50.670]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:55.052 --> 00:00:58.316]  First off, we saw how phony all this new Flynn news was on Friday.
[00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:04.923]  We're proven right that it was a fake news story from ABC News that Trump had been caught lying about when he told Flynn to meet with the Russians.
[00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:10.688]  It's all coming up today, but there is an internal war going on that's now going public.
[00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:15.533]  It turns out the FBI and Mueller's been criminally investigated for 11 months.
[00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:19.797]  They are preparing imminent indictments of Trump and others, as I broke first Friday.
[00:01:19.797 --> 00:01:20.978]  That's now in the news.
[00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:23.301]  But first, let's go to this John Bowne report.
[00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:30.468]  I saw the headlines Friday morning about Flynn was ordered by Trump to make contact with the Russians.
[00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.989]  And then I began to read the ABC News report.
[00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:38.411]  I went, wait a minute.
[00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:48.121]  These transcripts from Intercepts have been alluded to before from December of last year when he was the incoming president-elect.
[00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:48.821]  And I sat on air.
[00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.691]  I said, this is fake news.
[00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:55.873]  At 11am, when I went live, I said, Drudge isn't fake.
[00:01:55.873 --> 00:01:58.754]  When I'm reading headlines off Drudge, he's just linking to the news.
[00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:01.155]  But I said, look at the headlines on Drudge.
[00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.996]  I said, that's fake.
[00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:05.577]  Flynn talked to them once.
[00:02:05.577 --> 00:02:08.039]  He was the incoming National Security Advisor.
[00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.459]  Look at that!
[00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:12.096]  Merry Christmas, Mr. Mueller!
[00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:21.870]  When he's not on tarmacs handing out uranium, or when the FBI's not, you know, trying to cover up illegal Clinton Attorney General meetings on the tarmac.
[00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.372]  Why, Mueller...
[00:02:24.668 --> 00:02:30.994]  Flips Flynn and gets him to plead guilty to lying to the FBI.
[00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:35.137]  Report, Flynn says Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians.
[00:02:35.137 --> 00:02:37.379]  Feels president has abandoned him.
[00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.684]  Prepared to testify against Trump family, White House staff.
[00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:48.088]  Now that's what the media is telling us about this information.
[00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:50.871]  I followed all this in absolute detail.
[00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:56.050]  How they illegally surveilled President-elect Trump.
[00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.853]  And then they said, oh watch out, we've got the surveillance proving you colluded with the Russians.
[00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:00.694]  And Trump went, really?
[00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:02.035]  Without a warrant?
[00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:04.137]  And you demasked the information?
[00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:05.918]  And you leaked it to the news?
[00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:07.079]  That's multiple crimes!
[00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.500]  They went, oh no!
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.141]  No, no, no!
[00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:10.082]  We never did that!
[00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:12.924]  Once he was President-elect, they suddenly went, we never did that!
[00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:14.085]  We never said that!
[00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:15.226]  No one ever spied on you!
[00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:16.167]  That's insane!
[00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:17.388]  We had that whole controversy!
[00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:29.141]  So the minute I saw this and it said intercepts, well I remember the congressional hearings about the intercepts that came months ago.
[00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:40.329]  I remember all the reports and they just hope you get confused in all the minutiae and just tune out and just believe that Trump's been caught lying when it's all right there.
[00:03:41.257 --> 00:03:47.378]  They've already testified on the demasking, they've testified on the FISA court warrants they did get, a bunch of the stuff they didn't get.
[00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:52.099]  They just call it intercepts, monitoring, and then they go in and listen to it later.
[00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:04.842]  But if they didn't order direct wiretapping, as they call it, which is still monitoring, wiretapping is the old term, then they don't call it illegal surveillance just because you were being surveilled.
[00:04:04.842 --> 00:04:07.102]  It's all semantical manipulation.
[00:04:07.102 --> 00:04:09.143]  And so I knew as soon as I read
[00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:15.244]  The news, not just from ABC but other big fake news outlets, said it was fake.
[00:04:15.244 --> 00:04:21.787]  Because they were talking about the intercepts that have already been in the news, they've already had hearings on under oath.
[00:04:21.787 --> 00:04:32.151]  And I was like, oh my god, they're recycling it, but just changing the date to five or six months previous to that in the middle of 2016, which is exactly what they did.
[00:04:32.151 --> 00:04:38.813]  Flynn and Trump deserve service medals for how good they did coming in as the
[00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:47.244]  President-elect, the National Security Advisor-elect, how good a job they were doing, how hard they were working, it's just unprecedented.
[00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:50.609]  How they're representing America and getting things done.
[00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:55.035]  Folks, we'll be right back on the other side of this break with the bombshell news, and it is bombshell.
[00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:56.657]  They are getting ready to indict the president.
[00:04:56.657 --> 00:04:56.897]  Watch.
[00:04:58.484 --> 00:05:09.951]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:18.856]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:27.822]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:32.845]  And we also have an everyday extremely affordable Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[00:05:32.845 --> 00:05:33.726]  But all of these
[00:05:34.546 --> 00:05:43.108]  ...are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[00:05:43.108 --> 00:05:48.969]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:57.991]  When you purchase it at m4wrestore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:23.459]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:32.621]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:35.821]  Well, on Friday, I laid it out.
[00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:46.204]  The fact that Mueller's kept jury of swamp things in the District of Criminals
[00:06:48.237 --> 00:07:10.656]  Is preparing to claim that the president has obstructed justice and have a grand jury attempt to nullify the 2016 election, the political realignment, and the burgeoning economic recovery.
[00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:13.278]  That's their stated goal.
[00:07:13.278 --> 00:07:15.779]  You can see the writing on the wall.
[00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:19.539]  They want to get this going by the end of the year.
[00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:27.701]  They've canvassed the Republicans, the Democrats have, saying your boy is going to be gone by the new year.
[00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:30.662]  We, of course, broke that information.
[00:07:30.662 --> 00:07:41.364]  And knowing of their plan to roll out this fake investigation and exposing what frauds they are and exposing how staged it is, is critical to derailing that.
[00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:47.403]  And now you see it's been happening.
[00:07:47.403 --> 00:08:02.107]  I know from White House sources that Trump's two personal lawyers continue to tell him, you didn't do anything, you didn't obstruct, so you have nothing to worry about, just don't talk to Flynn.
[00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:05.728]  And Trump's done nothing wrong, so he's like, okay, I'm not worried about it.
[00:08:05.728 --> 00:08:12.950]  Then one of the lawyers on Friday tweets, as if he's Trump, yes,
[00:08:15.168 --> 00:08:23.952]  The President knew that Flynn had lied, so that's why he was fired.
[00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:38.179]  Well, back at the time, we were told it was because he reportedly got crosswise with the Vice President, and that that's why he was fired, but not lying to the FBI.
[00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:38.659]  So again,
[00:08:41.206 --> 00:08:46.129]  You have the Democrats in bed with the Russians to an unbelievable level.
[00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:55.533]  You have this whole collusion investigation going on for over a year and a half, 11 months officially, with Mueller, and there's nothing there.
[00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:59.876]  All the NSA transcripts, all the spying, all the surveillance.
[00:08:59.876 --> 00:09:02.097]  You see a president working hard.
[00:09:02.097 --> 00:09:05.419]  You see his National Security Advisor working hard.
[00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:07.720]  So now they're changing it to, oh, the Logan Act!
[00:09:09.881 --> 00:09:17.026]  You were talking to foreign officials in an unofficial capacity.
[00:09:17.026 --> 00:09:28.113]  Well, that goes for members of Congress and people under the President who aren't on sanctioned trips, and the Democrats constantly violate it, Republicans violate it, but Trump isn't violating it because he's the President reaching out to foreign leaders.
[00:09:28.113 --> 00:09:29.774]  There's nothing there.
[00:09:29.774 --> 00:09:33.796]  They're acting like if the President gets up in the morning, he's committed a crime.
[00:09:33.796 --> 00:09:34.737]  But here's the big news.
[00:09:36.823 --> 00:09:44.888]  The DOJ has been investigating the FBI criminally, Mueller and others for 11 months.
[00:09:44.888 --> 00:09:51.692]  House Intel chairman draws up contempt charges against FBI after Stonewall.
[00:09:51.692 --> 00:10:00.657]  Republicans prepare for war with FBI, DOJ to file contempt action over anti-Trump bias.
[00:10:00.657 --> 00:10:03.859]  Dershowitz, no case for obstruction of justice against Trump.
[00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:16.181]  Continuing, is President Trump's legal team preparing for an imminent obstruction of justice charge?
[00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:20.081]  Is the question a lot of mainstream media is asking.
[00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:23.002]  And here you've got NBC News.
[00:10:23.002 --> 00:10:29.703]  Dianne Feinstein, Senate Republican probe building obstruction case against Trump.
[00:10:29.703 --> 00:10:32.944]  That came out on Sunday.
[00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:34.304]  What did I tell you on Friday?
[00:10:35.546 --> 00:10:37.647]  It's always been about obstruction.
[00:10:37.647 --> 00:10:40.509]  Not that Trump did anything wrong.
[00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:42.970]  Not that Trump ever colluded.
[00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.671]  Not that Trump ever sold out U.S.
[00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:45.492]  interest.
[00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:47.633]  Everything the Democrats have done in spades.
[00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:49.154]  In triplicate.
[00:10:49.154 --> 00:10:50.635]  At legendary level.
[00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:52.596]  No.
[00:10:52.596 --> 00:10:57.299]  They're gonna claim the President talking to Comey going, Flynn's a great guy, leave him alone.
[00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:00.821]  Yeah, I hope if he did do something you go easy on him.
[00:11:02.179 --> 00:11:10.084]  That's what a mom would say to a judge if their son got caught reckless driving or stealing pumpkins out of the pumpkin patch.
[00:11:10.084 --> 00:11:13.086]  Judge, I hope you can go easy on him.
[00:11:13.086 --> 00:11:14.547]  Except Trump's the president!
[00:11:14.547 --> 00:11:18.970]  He could have ordered Comey to do nothing.
[00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.191]  So that's all they've got.
[00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:27.095]  And we've got Comey in Congress saying the president didn't obstruct in his opinion, but now they're trying to walk that back and change it.
[00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:28.656]  And these are the swamp things.
[00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:30.758]  These are the unelected individuals
[00:11:32.145 --> 00:11:43.688]  Who now are hanging their hat on obstruction and hanging their hat on the Logan Act when there's no evidence of either one.
[00:11:43.688 --> 00:11:55.872]  And instead there's Comey and Mueller and others covering up for the Clintons to engage in legendary paper play, not just with Russia but with over a hundred other countries and corporations in the Clinton Foundation.
[00:11:57.861 --> 00:12:05.269]  So if they can maneuver this in the media and maneuver this in the culture and somehow sell the idea that this is real, they're going to go with it.
[00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:17.602]  By the way, ABC News made the strategic decision an hour after the indictment was already out, saying specifically Trump ordered Flynn to make contact with the Russians when he was
[00:12:19.002 --> 00:12:27.907]  President-elect, which is completely kosher and normal, and he should be impeached if he wasn't making contact with the Russians once you're president-elect.
[00:12:27.907 --> 00:12:31.288]  Because they got nuclear weapons.
[00:12:31.288 --> 00:12:38.952]  They had their head of their investigative bureau, Brian Ross, went with what he knew he needed to do.
[00:12:38.952 --> 00:12:43.055]  And if he's going to be a sacrificial lamb and get suspended for four weeks, so be it.
[00:12:43.055 --> 00:12:46.657]  He takes one for the team, he goes out there and he says,
[00:12:47.697 --> 00:13:02.589]  This says, and my sources say, he did this six months before the president was even president-elect to specifically wound the president and charge up the troops and have hype all over the nation.
[00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:08.547]  Where the people buying into this say, see, we're vindicated, so they finally got a shot in the arm.
[00:13:08.547 --> 00:13:10.929]  It doesn't matter it got retracted by the evening.
[00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:22.918]  I had people at the grocery store and a restaurant on Saturday come up and tell me, F you, you Russian agent.
[00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:24.219]  And they're on the street.
[00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:24.980]  I get the emails.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.421]  I see it on Facebook, Twitter.
[00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:27.862]  They're saying this is real.
[00:13:27.862 --> 00:13:30.865]  They don't care.
[00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:31.025]  So,
[00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.834]  That shows you how dirty these individuals are.
[00:13:35.834 --> 00:13:41.079]  I mean, just look at Joy Behar on The View in ecstasy.
[00:13:41.079 --> 00:13:52.630]  It'd already been out an hour that this had broken, but they send out the aide, they send out the producer to hand her a card, and then she reads it, and they are in ecstasy, the other harpies.
[00:13:53.442 --> 00:14:04.884]  The other Banshees are just in ecstasy with their disinfo and their lies that, oh, during the campaign Trump ordered Flynn to make contact with the Russians.
[00:14:04.884 --> 00:14:10.745]  And they're still running news articles on the Huffington Post and other places saying it's real.
[00:14:10.745 --> 00:14:13.086]  They're not retracting it on the Huffington Post.
[00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:15.626]  They're not retracting it, no.
[00:14:15.626 --> 00:14:17.927]  They're still passing those videos around.
[00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:29.807]  And so, low-information voters can sit there in a restaurant or in a grocery store, to the Trump family, or myself, or anybody else, and walk over and say, I knew you were a Russian agent.
[00:14:29.807 --> 00:14:32.970]  You're going to go to prison.
[00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.233]  And they have congressional hearings and say it about me, too, with no evidence.
[00:14:37.233 --> 00:14:43.719]  They say, Impel Wars gets its news from the Russians and follows their orders.
[00:14:43.719 --> 00:14:46.501]  I come in here and look at hundreds of articles, video clips, look at everything.
[00:14:47.657 --> 00:14:51.158]  The Russians have very little influence on me.
[00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:53.219]  British news has a much bigger influence.
[00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:56.400]  That just means why I'm reading news.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.501]  It's just crazy, but they don't care.
[00:14:58.501 --> 00:15:02.142]  They're the globalists, they're the outside power, and they're getting ready to try to remove the president.
[00:15:02.142 --> 00:15:07.944]  So here's Joy Behar, here's Joy Behar celebrating the disinfo that they're sharing.
[00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:10.085]  Three days later, still on the internet, they don't care.
[00:15:10.085 --> 00:15:10.385]  Here it is.
[00:15:11.332 --> 00:15:12.893]  Breaking news.
[00:15:12.893 --> 00:15:13.574]  Oh my god.
[00:15:13.574 --> 00:15:15.095]  Oh, breaking news.
[00:15:15.095 --> 00:15:27.886]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!
[00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:29.107]  Yay!
[00:15:29.107 --> 00:15:31.729]  We're going to destroy the recovery.
[00:15:31.729 --> 00:15:34.011]  We're going to arrest the president.
[00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:39.776]  We're going to have a civil war.
[00:15:39.776 --> 00:15:39.916]  Yay!
[00:15:45.368 --> 00:15:46.889]  Yeah!
[00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:47.950]  Woo!
[00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:48.831]  Yeah!

[00:15:53.134 --> 00:15:53.715]  Oh!
[00:15:53.715 --> 00:15:54.215]  Oh!
[00:15:54.215 --> 00:15:56.737]  We're gonna kill the country!
[00:15:57.563 --> 00:16:00.605]  Want revenge on the common housefly?

[00:18:28.502 --> 00:18:37.225]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[00:19:54.442 --> 00:20:00.624]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:20:00.624 --> 00:20:03.285]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:40.980]  You know, we've got a Christmas message from the President that upset a lot of Democrats over the weekend.
[00:20:42.312 --> 00:20:53.259]  They're so bigoted, they're so anti-Christian, that even the Germanic traditions, the Tannenbaum and things, they want that type of stuff banned if they can.
[00:20:53.259 --> 00:21:00.224]  Obviously, and tell kids they can't hand out Christmas cards at public schools because there's a separation of church and state.
[00:21:00.224 --> 00:21:05.988]  No, the school shouldn't have an official religion, but you can hand out whatever you want!
[00:21:07.585 --> 00:21:14.251]  So these are authoritarian dirtbags who want to shut down free speech across the board, but they're failing.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:24.781]  And people like Joy Behard last week, The Huffington Post, and hundreds of other publications will not retract their reports about her.
[00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:30.286]  Celebrating the fake news that Flynn was ordered to meet with the Russians before the president was elected.
[00:21:32.739 --> 00:21:36.000]  Which could be some type of collusion, perhaps.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.601]  So the story's been retracted.
[00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:41.063]  It was fake, on purpose, by ABC News.
[00:21:41.063 --> 00:21:51.127]  But the Huffington Post and hundreds of other publications, I noticed over the weekend, are still sharing the video and the articles like it's true!
[00:21:52.702 --> 00:21:55.947]  Merry Christmas, we're gonna give you fake news.
[00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:58.391]  Merry Christmas, we're gonna bankrupt the country.
[00:21:58.391 --> 00:21:58.932]  Yay!
[00:21:58.932 --> 00:22:00.394]  We're gonna stop that recovery.
[00:22:00.394 --> 00:22:03.359]  We're gonna kick off a constitutional crisis.
[00:22:03.359 --> 00:22:04.200]  Yay!
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.906]  Over made-up Russia garbage with a corrupt former FBI director.
[00:22:11.428 --> 00:22:26.792]  Who is submerged in Russian corruption and killed the criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and Uranium One and who is involved with corrupt Russian companies in huge criminal payouts where he didn't even invest in companies but got money back.
[00:22:26.792 --> 00:22:36.815]  Mueller is a horrible corrupt pig who protected the Clintons, protected Obama, took the radical Islamic groups off the terror list.
[00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:37.575]  He's basically
[00:22:39.286 --> 00:22:44.732]  Oh, a hobbyist, just like Brennan and the rest of them, and he's a monster.
[00:22:44.732 --> 00:22:49.176]  So here's Joy Behar, Merry Christmas, celebrating the lie.
[00:22:49.176 --> 00:22:49.497]  Oh, and the...
[00:22:50.376 --> 00:22:54.418]  The producer walks out in the hands of the card and says, we've got breaking news.
[00:22:54.418 --> 00:22:56.979]  Yeah, more fake news.
[00:22:56.979 --> 00:23:02.121]  That now, their low-information voters are still sharing this!
[00:23:02.121 --> 00:23:05.002]  Still sharing all the celebration clips.
[00:23:05.002 --> 00:23:07.904]  And then, when they cuss at you on the street, you go, hey, that's fake!
[00:23:07.904 --> 00:23:09.985]  Aw, shut up, Russian!
[00:23:09.985 --> 00:23:11.205]  You're going to prison!
[00:23:11.205 --> 00:23:12.526]  Hey, actually, that's not true.
[00:23:12.526 --> 00:23:13.886]  Shut up!
[00:23:13.886 --> 00:23:15.027]  I'll throw hot coffee on ya!
[00:23:16.434 --> 00:23:19.595]  I'm gonna tell you F off, you don't talk to me.
[00:23:19.595 --> 00:23:21.216]  I'm a God.
[00:23:21.216 --> 00:23:22.876]  We're gonna screw the country over.
[00:23:22.876 --> 00:23:23.977]  You got it Jones?
[00:23:23.977 --> 00:23:25.237]  You got it Trump?
[00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.418]  You got it America?
[00:23:27.418 --> 00:23:29.119]  We don't want the facts.
[00:23:29.119 --> 00:23:29.879]  Here's Joy Behart.
[00:23:31.182 --> 00:23:32.484]  Breaking news.
[00:23:32.484 --> 00:23:33.144]  Oh my god.
[00:23:33.144 --> 00:23:34.666]  Oh, breaking news.
[00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:47.539]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!
[00:23:47.539 --> 00:23:47.639]  Yes!
[00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:16.735]  But, again, a celebrating, even if it was true, celebrating wild-eyed.
[00:24:16.735 --> 00:24:19.798]  But none of it is.
[00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:22.720]  And that's what they do, they celebrate hoaxes.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.703]  And the low-information voters celebrate being manipulated and lied to.
[00:24:26.703 --> 00:24:29.025]  And they're upset the economy's roaring back.
[00:24:29.025 --> 00:24:30.746]  They're upset optimism's roaring back.
[00:24:30.746 --> 00:24:33.128]  They're upset small businesses are coming back.
[00:24:33.128 --> 00:24:33.809]  They're upset!
[00:24:35.776 --> 00:24:40.219]  What are they going to do to fly over country if it can't be bankrupted and controlled?
[00:24:40.219 --> 00:24:41.440]  And here's what they're really upset about.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.044]  Again, the President and Melania with one of their Christmas messages on Friday.
[00:24:46.044 --> 00:24:49.967]  Throughout the weekend there was just, this is bigoted.
[00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:51.428]  This is hateful.
[00:24:51.428 --> 00:24:54.170]  Obama only said holidays.
[00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.151]  Trump said Christmas.
[00:24:56.151 --> 00:25:00.815]  This is a cult trying to tell us what words to use and overthrow traditionalism.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:21.126]  The opposite of wanting to have diversity, the opposite of wanting to have tolerance, just flagrant, frothing, speech control, ne'er-do-well, nimrod, control freaks.
[00:25:21.126 --> 00:25:21.506]  Here it is.
[00:25:22.935 --> 00:25:34.702]  This Christmas story begins 2,000 years ago with a mother, a father, their baby son, and the most extraordinary gift of all, the gift of God's love for all of humanity.
[00:25:34.702 --> 00:25:44.769]  Whatever our beliefs, we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of this incredible life forever changed the course of human history.
[00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:53.836]  Each and every year at Christmastime, we recognize that the real spirit of Christmas is not what we have.
[00:25:53.836 --> 00:25:55.637]  It's about who we are.
[00:25:55.637 --> 00:25:59.660]  Each one of us is a child of God.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:04.104]  That is the true source of joy this time of the year.
[00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:08.187]  That is what makes every Christmas merry.
[00:26:08.527 --> 00:26:20.755]  And now, as the President of the United States, it's my tremendous honor to finally wish America and the world a very Merry Christmas.
[00:26:20.755 --> 00:26:24.678]  There is the main triggering event, official White House video.
[00:26:24.678 --> 00:26:35.926]  Now, if you go to CNN or you go to NBC, if you go to the entertainment division of NBC, doesn't matter if it's Saturday Night Live or doesn't matter if it's NBC News or CNN, entertainment or non-entertainment,
[00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:38.945]  It's Trump's failure.
[00:26:38.945 --> 00:26:41.509]  He never got anything done.
[00:26:41.509 --> 00:26:43.232]  He's a moron.
[00:26:43.232 --> 00:26:45.116]  He's on his way out.
[00:26:45.116 --> 00:26:46.498]  That was the CNN headline.
[00:26:46.498 --> 00:26:49.183]  Trump finally gets one accomplishment.
[00:26:49.183 --> 00:26:50.645]  Tax cuts.
[00:26:50.645 --> 00:26:50.865]  But...
[00:26:52.523 --> 00:26:57.047]  Right as the Mueller investigation gets shorn up and shown to be credible.
[00:26:57.047 --> 00:26:58.568]  Totally uncredible!
[00:26:58.568 --> 00:27:01.650]  But they have to admit the one success, the one success?
[00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:09.436]  Killing TPP, renegotiating NAFTA and GATT, the economy roaring back, cutting all these regulations, the optimism.
[00:27:09.436 --> 00:27:11.478]  I'm not going to go into all of it.
[00:27:11.478 --> 00:27:13.820]  70% reduction in illegals coming across.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.922]  But those aren't successful things, the globalists.
[00:27:16.522 --> 00:27:25.390]  But they just constantly try to kill exuberance and kill confidence and kill the economy and control everything.
[00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:30.835]  They're just a bunch of sourpuss, killjoy, saboteurs.
[00:27:30.835 --> 00:27:40.443]  When you officially go in a war and you try to demoralize the other side with transmissions into their country, that's what this is.
[00:27:40.443 --> 00:27:42.485]  The mainstream media, the globalists,
[00:27:43.834 --> 00:27:49.018]  Their whole system is classic demoralization.
[00:27:49.018 --> 00:27:53.722]  It's 100% classic tactics to break the will of a people.
[00:27:55.134 --> 00:28:00.138]  And so when we're watching all this, remember that, and I know most of you know that.
[00:28:00.138 --> 00:28:15.749]  It's why this broadcast is enemy number one to the globalists, not because of me, but because of the guests and the sources and the listenership and the viewers and the activist audience that is interfaced with us, that is aware of how stuff works.
[00:28:15.749 --> 00:28:17.951]  That is horrifying to the globalists.
[00:28:19.551 --> 00:28:31.002]  But not just the fact that we understand their game plan and how to counter it, but that we also have will, and that we're confident, and that we've got God, and we're not going to back down.
[00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:32.964]  We're not going to give up.
[00:28:32.964 --> 00:28:35.286]  We're not going to go away.
[00:28:35.286 --> 00:28:42.393]  And now that we're tasting major victory, the fires of liberty are going from roaring to raging.
[00:28:43.399 --> 00:28:44.781]  So I'll say it again.
[00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:46.102]  Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:28:46.102 --> 00:28:50.827]  And we're going to come back and break down the serious news, though, on so many fronts.
[00:28:50.827 --> 00:28:55.692]  And the Democrats getting ready to be the Grinch that stole the American and global recovery.
[00:28:55.692 --> 00:28:56.153]  Stay with us.
[00:28:57.446 --> 00:28:58.467]  Hey, Daniel Brinkman.

[00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.852]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:29:29.852 --> 00:29:30.873]  That's true.
[00:29:30.873 --> 00:29:35.936]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?

[00:29:59.662 --> 00:30:02.244]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[00:30:02.244 --> 00:30:16.856]  Yeah, hey listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:30:16.856 --> 00:30:24.002]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:30:24.442 --> 00:30:24.963]  Well, thank you.
[00:30:24.963 --> 00:30:36.113]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:30:36.113 --> 00:30:42.359]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[00:30:42.359 --> 00:30:44.962]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[00:30:45.502 --> 00:30:52.347]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:30:52.347 --> 00:31:01.533]  That is the new Shirt of the Month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:05.976]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:31:05.976 --> 00:31:07.717]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:13.412]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:13.412 --> 00:31:15.773]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:17.534]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:31:17.534 --> 00:31:22.817]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:31:22.817 --> 00:31:25.098]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[00:31:25.098 --> 00:31:30.761]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:31.161]  Secret 12.
[00:31:31.161 --> 00:31:31.942]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:31:32.222 --> 00:31:32.642]  We're good.
[00:31:58.413 --> 00:31:59.214]  I'm so excited.
[00:31:59.214 --> 00:32:09.360]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:14.864]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:32:14.864 --> 00:32:17.886]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:32:17.886 --> 00:32:26.672]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:32:28.753 --> 00:32:34.054]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:32:34.054 --> 00:32:39.016]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:32:39.016 --> 00:32:48.338]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:32:48.338 --> 00:32:51.019]  It is amazing!
[00:32:51.019 --> 00:32:56.000]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:32:59.933 --> 00:33:11.588]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.588 --> 00:33:17.835]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:57.964 --> 00:34:00.387]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:34:00.387 --> 00:34:03.550]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:17.766]  And I've got a special report coming up how the mainstream media is demonizing and attacking Alabamans because their brainwashing against Judge Roy Moore's constituents or would-be constituents isn't working.
[00:34:18.547 --> 00:34:29.934]  And so you see the disgusting hatred that the establishment has of flyover country, especially the South, which they see the flyover country of the flyover country.
[00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:34.556]  So that's going to be coming up a little bit later today.
[00:34:34.556 --> 00:34:36.738]  Also, we're going to get into the historical facts.
[00:34:37.885 --> 00:34:40.586]  Is the president truly above the law?
[00:34:40.586 --> 00:34:41.826]  Well, the answer is no.
[00:34:41.826 --> 00:34:51.228]  But is the president above this type of obstruction of justice that they're specifically talking about when he's in charge of the Justice Department?
[00:34:51.228 --> 00:34:53.409]  And the answer is absolutely.
[00:34:53.409 --> 00:35:04.212]  Because he's got judicial privilege and executive privilege to not have to tell people everything he's doing and everything that he's up to.
[00:35:05.051 --> 00:35:10.674]  So he can choose what he wants to and what he doesn't want to tell people.
[00:35:10.674 --> 00:35:12.715]  It's really just that simple.
[00:35:12.715 --> 00:35:20.680]  And then again, it's up to the voters to hold him accountable or the House of Representatives to impeach.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.100]  That's where they get the indictment.
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.622]  Then the Senate is where they have the trial.
[00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:26.163]  That's the only way.
[00:35:26.163 --> 00:35:31.846]  Because you'd have the courts always at some county or city or state level or federal level
[00:35:33.001 --> 00:35:47.232]  You'd have some hijacked group run by some out-of-control arrogant swamp monster like Robert Mueller and they're going to decide to get a grand jury that's political to take the president out.
[00:35:47.232 --> 00:35:52.917]  A president would never stay in
[00:35:54.673 --> 00:35:55.533]  Power.
[00:35:55.533 --> 00:35:57.394]  They would be removed politically.
[00:35:57.394 --> 00:36:01.336]  Take Travis County, here where Austin, the city of Austin is based.
[00:36:01.336 --> 00:36:13.683]  They famously have indicted hundreds of prominent Republicans in the last 50, 60 years and get convictions that are almost always overturned.
[00:36:13.683 --> 00:36:16.304]  Tom DeLay is a great example.
[00:36:16.304 --> 00:36:23.568]  So that's an example of how they can use the District of Columbia swamp monsters or the Travis County system
[00:36:24.892 --> 00:36:31.875]  To politically throw out tentacles of control and get away with a lot of crazy stuff.
[00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:37.037]  So I'm going to go to this report here that breaks all this down in a moment.
[00:36:37.037 --> 00:36:47.281]  Then I'm going to come back from break and get into, is President Trump's legal team preparing for imminent obstruction of justice charges?
[00:36:48.368 --> 00:36:54.252]  We're also going to look at the tax reform, the House and Senate version.
[00:36:54.252 --> 00:37:03.980]  And we're also then going to look at the largest ever military drill to simulate war with North Korea that's going on this week.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.323]  Also, Odinga advisor arrested on suspicion of inciting violence.
[00:37:08.323 --> 00:37:12.306]  That's Obama's cousin, the big Islamicist.
[00:37:12.306 --> 00:37:13.707]  So that's a window into Obama.
[00:37:13.707 --> 00:37:16.249]  We're going to get into that report as well.
[00:37:17.284 --> 00:37:22.671]  And we're also going to open the phones up and take your phone calls.
[00:37:22.671 --> 00:37:25.054]  But again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:37:25.054 --> 00:37:30.982]  Newswars.com, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com are our main sites.
[00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:31.683]  And more and more...
[00:37:32.264 --> 00:37:39.471]  They're trying to censor those, so when you spread the articles and spread the videos, it really does get around the censors and helps us win in the info war.
[00:37:39.471 --> 00:37:41.193]  So great job, listeners and viewers.
[00:37:41.193 --> 00:37:44.517]  Please keep it up and plug our local AMNFM affiliates.
[00:37:44.517 --> 00:37:46.439]  But here is the report.
[00:37:46.439 --> 00:37:49.942]  71% of Alabama Republicans triggered by the left.
[00:37:49.942 --> 00:37:51.003]  Or have they triggered the left?
[00:37:51.003 --> 00:37:51.264]  Here it is.
[00:37:51.886 --> 00:38:11.732]  A new CBS poll was released about the Alabama Senate race and lo and behold 71% of Alabama Republicans believe the allegations against Roy Moore are false and those who believe this also believed that the Democrats and the media are behind these allegations.
[00:38:11.732 --> 00:38:19.474]  It's also important to note that this CBS poll also revealed that Roy Moore is leading the Senate race in Alabama at
[00:38:20.014 --> 00:38:25.656]  49%, whereas his opponent, Doug Jones, is at a measly 43%.
[00:38:25.656 --> 00:38:34.039]  To nobody's surprise, these poll findings sparked a massive liberal temper tantrum on Twitter.
[00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:40.721]  In fact, the 71% of Alabama Republicans' Twitter storm had begun.
[00:38:41.181 --> 00:38:45.505]  I'm sorry if this is rude and yet it needs to be said.
[00:38:45.505 --> 00:38:48.848]  71% of Alabama Republicans are stupid.
[00:38:48.848 --> 00:38:54.574]  And they wonder why people from Alabama get stereotyped because stereotype is true!
[00:38:55.416 --> 00:39:05.261]  Look, this goes to show you that 71% of Alabama Republicans also have an IQ below 71.
[00:39:05.261 --> 00:39:07.942]  Funny how the numbers worked out on that one.
[00:39:07.942 --> 00:39:15.586]  Is this the same poll that determined that 71% of Alabama Republicans are idiots?
[00:39:16.446 --> 00:39:20.750]  We're gonna see who's feeling like an idiot after the election results are in.
[00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:27.116]  71% of Alabama Republicans are white trash with no morals.
[00:39:27.116 --> 00:39:41.149]  I think it is more accurate to say that 71% of Alabama Republicans don't know what the big deal is since they have all but with someone underage at least several times in their life.
[00:39:43.662 --> 00:39:52.265]  71% of Alabama Republicans believe that an allegation is the term for a group of alligators.
[00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:55.226]  Oh, you totally destroyed them.
[00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:58.027]  For real though, you actually think that?
[00:39:58.027 --> 00:40:04.350]  71% of Alabama Republicans are the direct result of inbreeding.
[00:40:05.391 --> 00:40:12.396]  71% of Alabama Republicans are also married to their 14-year-old cousins.
[00:40:12.396 --> 00:40:19.042]  71% of Alabama Republicans evidently still eat dirt when they're pregnant.
[00:40:19.042 --> 00:40:24.927]  It looks like 100% of liberals will be eating their words after the election results come in.
[00:40:25.848 --> 00:40:31.918]  71% of Alabama Republicans have family trees with very few branches.
[00:40:31.918 --> 00:40:39.510]  In related news, 71% of Alabama Republicans are the offspring of brother and sister.
[00:40:40.262 --> 00:40:45.627]  In other related news, liberals are a bunch of condescending a**holes.
[00:40:45.627 --> 00:40:53.194]  These 71% of Alabama Republicans are the reason I can't stop in Alabama next year.
[00:40:53.194 --> 00:40:57.738]  I have two kids and I know they'll just get raped there.
[00:40:58.539 --> 00:41:07.682]  To the 29% of people living in Alabama who still have some humanity, leave while you can, especially if you have children.
[00:41:07.682 --> 00:41:10.523]  There is no hope for the other 71%.
[00:41:10.523 --> 00:41:20.647]  Yes, liberals, please leave out of the rural areas and move back to the sh**hole cities that you guys love to run into the ground.
[00:41:22.408 --> 00:41:28.813]  71% of Alabama Republicans just verified what I've always thought of Southern Christians.
[00:41:28.813 --> 00:41:44.725]  71% of Alabama Republicans are already terrible people, so to see them supporting a terrible person because of a non-existent being called God is telling us what we already know.
[00:41:45.866 --> 00:41:48.328]  That stuff is stupid!
[00:41:48.328 --> 00:41:48.968]  Ewww!
[00:41:48.968 --> 00:41:50.389]  Stupid?
[00:41:50.389 --> 00:41:51.810]  Non-existent God?
[00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:56.513]  Well, let's talk about non-existent evidence against Roy Moore.
[00:41:56.513 --> 00:42:08.242]  So I guess, supposedly, 71% of Alabama Republicans believe Roy Moore isn't a child molester, even when there's a mountain of documented evidence.
[00:42:09.062 --> 00:42:11.984]  By mountain of evidence, do you mean a yearbook signing?
[00:42:11.984 --> 00:42:20.270]  Don't you think if there was a mountain of evidence, you'd have enough to criminally prosecute or even civilly sue him?
[00:42:38.982 --> 00:42:47.334]  To the liberals mocking 71% of Alabama Republicans, how well did insulting Trump supporters work for you?
[00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:58.896]  I'm so excited.
[00:42:58.896 --> 00:43:09.042]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:09.042 --> 00:43:14.546]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:43:14.546 --> 00:43:17.548]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:17.548 --> 00:43:26.354]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:28.435 --> 00:43:48.006]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:48.006 --> 00:43:50.707]  It is amazing!
[00:43:50.707 --> 00:43:55.670]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[00:43:58.084 --> 00:44:03.035]  Emerix Essential Oils can help balance your sleep schedule and realign your sleep cycle.

[00:44:20.058 --> 00:44:28.060]  When using Emerix Essential Oils, there's no easier way to diffuse fragrances than with this essential oil scent diffuser pod.

[00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:59.110]  Not a group.
[00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:00.591]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:01.892]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:46:01.892 --> 00:46:03.112]  Why is this so good?
[00:46:03.112 --> 00:46:08.395]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:46:08.395 --> 00:46:21.941]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:46:21.941 --> 00:46:23.302]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:46:24.222 --> 00:46:25.723]  Spreading disease around.
[00:46:25.723 --> 00:46:28.243]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:46:28.243 --> 00:46:29.604]  These are all parasites.
[00:46:29.604 --> 00:46:30.704]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:32.044]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:46:32.044 --> 00:46:33.305]  You have the neem in there.
[00:46:33.305 --> 00:46:36.546]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:46:36.546 --> 00:46:39.707]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:46:39.707 --> 00:46:42.888]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:46:42.888 --> 00:46:43.928]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:46:43.928 --> 00:46:44.748]  Living Defense.

[00:46:51.491 --> 00:46:52.851]  Infowarslive.com.
[00:46:52.851 --> 00:46:55.093]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:46:55.093 --> 00:47:00.515]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:47:00.515 --> 00:47:10.221]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.221 --> 00:47:10.841]  Big Brother.
[00:47:17.609 --> 00:47:19.691]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:22.973]  Government cover us.
[00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:24.675]  You want answers?
[00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.817]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:26.817 --> 00:47:33.462]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:46.289 --> 00:47:49.650]  Alright folks, here's what's gonna happen next hour.
[00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:59.233]  I'm gonna open the phones up to people that disagree with myself, President Trump, with folks that believe the Russia narrative.
[00:47:59.233 --> 00:48:11.336]  And I know being on over 200 radio stations and some cable and TV stations and having giant amounts of people watching us online and seeing the trolls on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube,
[00:48:14.076 --> 00:48:24.525]  Then this is your shot to call in unscreened, other than where you're calling from, and obviously that you disagree, and we will get you on air next hour.
[00:48:24.525 --> 00:48:38.497]  Now we're also going to take calls just from folks in general to tell us what are you going to do if they indict Trump, the District of Columbia, a literal swamp grand jury, led by the swamp king,
[00:48:39.798 --> 00:48:48.401]  Mr. Russia Collusion, Kingpin, Tarmac Meeting, Mr. Uranium, Robert Mueller.
[00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:50.242]  What are you going to do if they do that?
[00:48:50.242 --> 00:48:57.664]  And how do they think they're going to get away with it when Trump's so popular and none of it's true?
[00:48:57.664 --> 00:49:03.466]  And Mueller is now under, by the way, I should make a bigger deal out of this, Mueller has been under criminal investigation.
[00:49:03.466 --> 00:49:04.647]  So has Comey.
[00:49:04.647 --> 00:49:05.527]  So have their aides.
[00:49:07.267 --> 00:49:20.635]  And now that's breaking that they've had an 11-month Inspector General investigation of the rogue, Democrat-run, Clinton-crime-machine-run Democratic Party.
[00:49:20.635 --> 00:49:28.320]  Now, people are sitting there saying, you know, the FBI's been really damaged and how dare Trump come out and say the FBI's a bad organization.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.684]  Trump said it's never had less credibility and that he hopes it gets its credibility back.
[00:49:33.684 --> 00:49:35.245]  We're not saying everybody in the FBI's bad.
[00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.751]  That's stupid.
[00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:52.720]  The point is, is that at the top, the Clintons, over the last 20 years, filled that sucker under Obama and under their eight years as well, 16 years, with a lot of really bad people.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.942]  And now Nunes is looking at criminal contempt.
[00:49:56.209 --> 00:50:00.974]  For the FBI not giving him information, this is really building towards a head.
[00:50:00.974 --> 00:50:03.757]  And it's going to be a constitutional crisis.
[00:50:03.757 --> 00:50:06.100]  So, A, do you think they're really going to do it?
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.583]  Because they've got the indictment of Flynn.
[00:50:08.583 --> 00:50:13.929]  We knew they had the indictment of Manafort months before they did, we told you, because we have the sources.
[00:50:13.929 --> 00:50:17.453]  And the word is they've got the grand jury ready to indict the president.
[00:50:18.444 --> 00:50:18.824]  We're good to go.
[00:50:34.482 --> 00:50:37.124]  The huevos to do this.
[00:50:37.124 --> 00:50:39.686]  And are they thinking about what it's going to trigger?
[00:50:39.686 --> 00:50:46.371]  I mean, this isn't Nixon in the middle of his second term they're doing this to, who they've caught at least doing something.
[00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:49.674]  This is the president who's done nothing.
[00:50:49.674 --> 00:50:54.618]  They have the NSA illegal wiretap transcript intercepts.
[00:50:54.618 --> 00:50:55.699]  It shows the opposite.
[00:50:58.223 --> 00:51:03.965]  So now they admit, oh, it's not collusion, it's obstruction, and it's violating the Logan Act.
[00:51:03.965 --> 00:51:05.825]  And there's none of that either!
[00:51:05.825 --> 00:51:13.448]  The President and his National Security Advisor can meet with anybody publicly or secretly whenever they want.
[00:51:13.448 --> 00:51:15.188]  That's the executive branch.
[00:51:15.188 --> 00:51:18.169]  That's what it does.
[00:51:18.169 --> 00:51:26.852]  The President could have a secret project building secret weapons out in the desert, and we wouldn't know about it, just like the Manhattan Project.
[00:51:26.852 --> 00:51:27.012]  So,
[00:51:28.564 --> 00:51:32.066]  They're trying to nullify the votes of the American people.
[00:51:32.066 --> 00:51:36.688]  They're trying to obstruct the return of our Republic.
[00:51:36.688 --> 00:51:41.450]  Now sometimes we get sarcastic callers, and I call for callers that disagree, and you can always call if you disagree.
[00:51:42.392 --> 00:52:02.817]  It's that if you really, really disagree and you really think that I'm a Russian agent, you really think Trump's a Russian agent, you really think I should be censored, you really think that Trump's done something wrong and you're upset about what's happening to the economy, whatever it is, I want to hear from you about
[00:52:04.724 --> 00:52:13.749]  Your perspective and how you can defend all the continued fake news about Trump and Russia that they've put out over and over again.
[00:52:13.749 --> 00:52:20.192]  Because remember, back in December and January, they said, oh, we've got all the intercepts.
[00:52:20.192 --> 00:52:24.895]  We've got the NSA wiretaps is the old term, but that's not what they are.
[00:52:24.895 --> 00:52:27.697]  We have all the recordings of Trump colluding with the Russians.
[00:52:27.697 --> 00:52:30.678]  So watch out, it's all going to come out.
[00:52:30.678 --> 00:52:31.779]  And Trump went, well, that's illegal.
[00:52:33.166 --> 00:52:40.488]  Plus, I didn't do that, but the fact that you're leaking intercepts, and they're illegal intercepts, and you've unmasked public figures and U.S.
[00:52:40.488 --> 00:52:42.468]  citizens, you're gonna go to jail!
[00:52:42.468 --> 00:52:44.309]  So they went, oh, we never said that!
[00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:45.869]  We never said we had intercepts!
[00:52:45.869 --> 00:52:47.009]  That's insane!
[00:52:47.009 --> 00:52:47.909]  You're crazy!
[00:52:47.909 --> 00:52:49.270]  Alex Jones is crazy!
[00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:54.171]  Remember, specifically, they claimed I made it up!
[00:52:55.947 --> 00:53:02.950]  Because I had a memory, and had thousands of news articles where they'd said it, and I was showing the news articles on air, saying, look how dumb they think you are.
[00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:10.613]  Really, all this show has is a memory.
[00:53:10.613 --> 00:53:10.993]  And so...
[00:53:13.939 --> 00:53:31.484]  You read the transcripts, you read what Trump's doing, and it sounds like you've got the ace of spades in there or something, really getting stuff done, which we've already seen the country come roaring back and respect for the nation and so many things there, and they're trying to obstruct it and block it.
[00:53:31.484 --> 00:53:32.464]  Do they have any idea?
[00:53:32.464 --> 00:53:34.725]  Can they think two feet in front of their nose?
[00:53:34.725 --> 00:53:36.385]  One inch in front of their nose?
[00:53:36.385 --> 00:53:42.647]  Can they think about the next steps that happen if they assassinate Trump, or they have the fake grand jury indict Trump?
[00:53:44.298 --> 00:53:51.924]  Then they'll create the illusion that he's supposed to go to jail or step down and, oh, the president's not responding to the grand jury's subpoena.
[00:53:51.924 --> 00:53:56.127]  The president's not responding to show up because he's not supposed to!
[00:53:56.127 --> 00:54:02.772]  Or any two-bit grand jury or jury could do something like this under control.
[00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:04.693]  It's its own branch of government.
[00:54:04.693 --> 00:54:09.017]  You don't see local courts indicting the Congress, do you?
[00:54:12.318 --> 00:54:14.139]  The entire Congress, you can't do that.
[00:54:14.139 --> 00:54:18.082]  Well, with the President, he's the entire executive!
[00:54:18.082 --> 00:54:22.625]  This is a power play, it's illegal, it's sickening.
[00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:40.777]  So the question is, if you get what you want, the embarrassment of the President, people that have been threatened with jail time, lying about the President, and then having the indictment in the House, and the trial in the Senate, on a giant nothing burger, when they're the ones in bed with Russia, where do you see this going?
[00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:41.978]  What do you think's gonna happen?
[00:54:43.183 --> 00:54:45.964]  Do you think they're going to indict him before Christmas?
[00:54:45.964 --> 00:54:50.905]  Is what they're currently discussing doing, according to my sources, in D.C.
[00:54:50.905 --> 00:54:57.266]  And hell, you've seen the Democrats come out and say, he's about to be indicted, I can quit my job now.
[00:54:57.266 --> 00:54:59.207]  We saw Oberman do that last week.
[00:54:59.207 --> 00:55:03.768]  They believe they're going to indict him before Christmas.
[00:55:03.768 --> 00:55:05.408]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:55:05.408 --> 00:55:09.249]  I'm saying right now, they're saying they intend to.
[00:55:09.249 --> 00:55:11.250]  And they're behaving like they mean to do it.
[00:55:12.588 --> 00:55:15.789]  Like sticking their finger in a light socket.
[00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:17.850]  So here's the toll-free number to join us, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:21.932]  And people that disagree will go to the head of the line, 877-789-2539.
[00:55:21.932 --> 00:55:24.252]  First-time callers, by the way.
[00:55:24.252 --> 00:55:25.153]  Agree, disagree, you're welcome.
[00:55:25.153 --> 00:55:25.693]  I want to hear from you, 877-789-2539.
[00:55:40.046 --> 00:55:41.587]  Three-nine.
[00:55:41.587 --> 00:55:45.368]  And please, I don't want any joke callers, okay, that call up and act like they're a liberal.
[00:55:45.368 --> 00:55:48.109]  There are real ones out there.
[00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:50.670]  Some of them can actually form sentences.
[00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.412]  On the street, all they say is, F you, we're going to get you, Russian agent.
[00:55:54.412 --> 00:56:06.877]  Well, I'm trying to give those folks a chance to call in, person to person, and actually on a platform, because nowhere Owen Schroyer goes, nowhere Millie Weaver goes, or any of our reporters on the street,
[00:56:08.271 --> 00:56:11.153]  99% of these people will not talk to us.
[00:56:11.153 --> 00:56:14.315]  They will not discuss anything with us.
[00:56:14.315 --> 00:56:15.555]  It's crazy.
[00:56:15.555 --> 00:56:16.736]  They have no intellectual argument.
[00:56:16.736 --> 00:56:19.097]  Well, here's your chance to prove me wrong.
[00:56:19.097 --> 00:56:22.419]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:56:22.419 --> 00:56:25.420]  Now, briefly, there's only a minute to break.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.902]  We have new specials this week.
[00:56:27.902 --> 00:56:31.344]  DNA Force has been back in stock for a little while.
[00:56:31.344 --> 00:56:32.985]  It is going to sell out in the next few weeks.
[00:56:34.008 --> 00:56:42.556]  We may not have any more for another two months because we're doing a reformulation right now because of availability of some of the things that are in it.
[00:56:42.556 --> 00:56:44.898]  The BioPQQ, the CoQ10, all of it.
[00:56:44.898 --> 00:56:49.862]  It's 33% off this flagship product.
[00:56:49.862 --> 00:56:54.726]  Other leading competitors are two or three times the cost that ours is because of markup.
[00:56:54.726 --> 00:57:00.592]  At $99, it is an incredible deal because you're talking 50-something dollars a product in there.
[00:57:01.312 --> 00:57:15.274]  I mean, it's amazing what it does for your cells, for nerve regrowth, for energy, it's patented, it's documented, DNA force is amazing, but it's very, very hard to source and produce because it is such a complex formula and that's why it's sold out half the time.
[00:57:15.274 --> 00:57:16.175]  Well, despite that!
[00:57:17.492 --> 00:57:18.653]  I'm selling it.
[00:57:18.653 --> 00:57:19.814]  33% off.
[00:57:19.814 --> 00:57:21.695]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:21.695 --> 00:57:22.835]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:22.835 --> 00:57:25.937]  And we also have other new specials this week.
[00:57:25.937 --> 00:57:31.121]  50% off on super blue fluoride-free toothpaste with iodine and colloidal silver in it.
[00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:34.263]  That's at infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:34.263 --> 00:57:36.524]  And Vitamin Mineral Fusion is amazing.
[00:57:36.524 --> 00:57:37.825]  It's 50% off as well.
[00:57:37.825 --> 00:57:39.266]  Your funding isn't just needed.
[00:57:39.266 --> 00:57:40.347]  It's critical.
[00:57:40.347 --> 00:57:41.648]  So thank you for your support.
[00:57:41.648 --> 00:57:42.568]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:59:39.924 --> 00:59:43.585]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:00:12.344 --> 01:00:22.989]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[01:00:22.989 --> 01:00:23.249]  Scum!
[01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:24.410]  Russian scum!
[01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:25.811]  The divorce comes to mind.
[01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:39.957]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:00:39.957 --> 01:00:41.538]  I will not let you down.
[01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:46.878]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:00:46.878 --> 01:01:03.061]  Alright, if you just joined us, I've given the phone number out for people that disagree and really think that we're under Russian control, that I'm getting orders from the Russians, that I'm getting funding from the Russians, that Trump is, and that there's proof there.
[01:01:03.061 --> 01:01:06.082]  I can't believe I'm on air even saying this.
[01:01:06.082 --> 01:01:07.102]  This is so ridiculous.
[01:01:08.911 --> 01:01:19.334]  Makes me angry just to say it, because it's like, you're welcome to call in and ask if I'm a violent player from China.
[01:01:19.334 --> 01:01:22.195]  It just has no connection to who I am.
[01:01:22.195 --> 01:01:25.876]  But that's the whole narrative by the globalists that have hijacked the country.
[01:01:25.876 --> 01:01:28.777]  They're the foreign multinational force.
[01:01:28.777 --> 01:01:31.058]  But I want to challenge you.
[01:01:31.058 --> 01:01:32.518]  Are you proud of what Mueller's done?
[01:01:32.518 --> 01:01:35.899]  Are you proud of the fact that there's nothing in any of this?
[01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:37.640]  I mean, Trump's done nothing.
[01:01:38.632 --> 01:01:46.478]  To the media resorts, to hoax headlines that Flynn has agreed to testify against Trump, that he was ordered during the campaign to meet with Russia.
[01:01:46.478 --> 01:01:47.518]  We've got him!
[01:01:47.518 --> 01:01:48.719]  We've got him!
[01:01:48.719 --> 01:01:50.460]  We're gonna get him!
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.142]  Let's queue up Joy Behard again.
[01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.042]  You can't play that enough.
[01:01:53.042 --> 01:02:06.632]  And then you realize, none of it's true, and these are the firing globalists that have hijacked our country, and here they are betting against America and celebrating, hoping they can kill the recovery.
[01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:16.157]  So I want to ask folks, what do you think is going to happen if they have their way?
[01:02:16.157 --> 01:02:18.998]  They have to have the House vote to indict the President.
[01:02:18.998 --> 01:02:23.499]  And this whole investigation has been discredited.
[01:02:23.499 --> 01:02:25.899]  And so I don't see them being able to do it.
[01:02:25.899 --> 01:02:27.179]  I don't see it working.
[01:02:27.179 --> 01:02:28.100]  But they don't care.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.721]  They're like piranhas just rushing headlong.
[01:02:32.721 --> 01:02:33.981]  They're getting more and more violent.
[01:02:35.657 --> 01:02:38.200]  They're calling for more and more violence.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.524]  So I'm asking our listeners, too.
[01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.486]  What do you think they're planning?
[01:02:43.486 --> 01:02:45.548]  Why do you think they're so arrogant?
[01:02:45.548 --> 01:02:48.692]  Because they have nothing, except on them.
[01:02:48.692 --> 01:02:50.534]  And what should we do to expose them?
[01:02:51.681 --> 01:02:59.967]  Well, I know this, Congressman Nunes, I really like him, he's exposing their criminality, talking about criminal contempt charges.
[01:02:59.967 --> 01:03:11.556]  We've got, we now have him in the Justice Department for 11 months, has been investigating Mueller and these political FBI agents and their activities, and they were about to release that info, so that's why Mueller leaked it ahead of time.
[01:03:11.556 --> 01:03:15.499]  So, it's all starting to come out.
[01:03:16.769 --> 01:03:21.611]  And the fact that the economy has been stabilized is the main reason they think they can't get rid of Trump.
[01:03:21.611 --> 01:03:23.591]  And that's why they're trying to get rid of the economy.
[01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:31.674]  But they're trying to say the president has accomplished anything, and the president's a loser, ignoring all the facts, to kill confidence.
[01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:32.934]  And so that's really it.
[01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:43.858]  If they can kill confidence, and if they can kill the economy, and if they can kill this recovery, they believe they can string this Russia baloney out long enough
[01:03:45.933 --> 01:03:50.857]  To finally get control of the House so they can start the impeachment of the President.
[01:03:50.857 --> 01:03:55.961]  Which itself will lead to a giant train wreck and a civil war in their own words.
[01:03:55.961 --> 01:03:57.622]  But let's go out to break with Joy Behar again.
[01:03:57.622 --> 01:03:59.424]  I'm going to come back and go right to your phone calls.
[01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:02.129]  Breaking news.
[01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:02.790]  Oh my god.
[01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:04.490]  Oh, breaking news.
[01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:17.034]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!
[01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:29.790]  We're gonna screw this country over good!
[01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:30.751]  Ha ha!
[01:04:30.751 --> 01:04:31.031]  Woo!
[01:04:31.031 --> 01:04:34.491]  Piss on America, yeah!
[01:04:34.491 --> 01:04:35.852]  Woo!
[01:04:35.852 --> 01:04:43.433]  Let's report some fake news.
[01:04:43.433 --> 01:04:49.715]  Oh man, you know... I've been really upset about all this, because this is serious stuff.
[01:04:49.715 --> 01:04:51.175]  And InfoWars is at the center of it.
[01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:52.495]  You're at the center of it.
[01:04:52.495 --> 01:04:54.516]  But now, I've really been analyzing this.
[01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:54.976]  We're gonna win.
[01:04:56.778 --> 01:05:05.043]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:05:05.043 --> 01:05:06.244]  A 360 win.
[01:05:06.244 --> 01:05:12.288]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:20.750]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:25.411]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:05:25.411 --> 01:05:31.933]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:05:31.933 --> 01:05:33.053]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com.
[01:05:33.553 --> 01:05:35.554]  Select your favorite product or products.
[01:05:35.554 --> 01:05:39.717]  Click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:05:39.717 --> 01:05:42.099]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[01:05:42.099 --> 01:05:46.922]  And with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:05:46.922 --> 01:05:47.882]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:05:47.882 --> 01:05:50.324]  Win, win, win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:50.324 --> 01:05:52.305]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:05:52.305 --> 01:05:56.168]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:06:06.261 --> 01:06:27.389]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.389 --> 01:06:30.430]  Okay, if you just tuned in, we've gotten into the second hour.
[01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.731]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I have issued a challenge.
[01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:50.449]  I want Democrats, or Liberals, or Mainline Republicans, whatever you call yourselves, mainstream media junkies, to call in and tell me the evidence that I'm involved with Russia, that Trump is, and that you think Mueller's doing a good job.
[01:06:50.449 --> 01:06:59.596]  I mean, explain to me, with a straight face, because they have congressional hearings saying that I'm a Russian agent with no proof.
[01:06:59.596 --> 01:07:00.857]  This is unprecedented.
[01:07:00.857 --> 01:07:04.060]  McCarthy never did anything like that when he had evidence on people.
[01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:07.191]  I've told Congress I want to testify.
[01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:08.031]  I'd love it.
[01:07:08.031 --> 01:07:12.314]  Because most of those Democrats have been paid off by foreign governments.
[01:07:12.314 --> 01:07:16.517]  Most of them not China, I mean not Russia, but China.
[01:07:16.517 --> 01:07:20.120]  So I'd love to get in a hearing with them and tear them up, the little traitors!
[01:07:21.513 --> 01:07:38.966]  But instead they just sit back and claim that Trump's this and Flynn's that and Alex Jones is this and our whole movement are just a bunch of boobies, a bunch of rubes, a bunch of schmucks, a bunch of marks, a bunch of nincompoop moron suckers.
[01:07:39.907 --> 01:07:48.214]  Who just were bamboozled by the Russians to want to get President Trump elected.
[01:07:48.214 --> 01:07:59.604]  And then, oh, it's so horrible now that the Russian agent is elected, the economy's rolling back, the military's getting stronger, the borders are secured.
[01:07:59.604 --> 01:08:02.686]  I mean, you think the Russians would do that?
[01:08:02.686 --> 01:08:04.948]  I mean, wow, the Russians really are our friends.
[01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:05.849]  And I watched
[01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:20.119]  This morning, because I got up at 3.30 in the morning, couldn't sleep, I watched the last few months of Saturday Night Live's opening live monologues.
[01:08:20.119 --> 01:08:31.907]  And in every monologue, they say, they had one with Vice President Pence, and he's in a meeting, talking to folks, and he says,
[01:08:34.121 --> 01:08:35.521]  They're like, tell your boss this.
[01:08:35.521 --> 01:08:38.202]  And he goes, I can't tell our boss, Vladimir Putin, that.
[01:08:38.202 --> 01:08:42.403]  And then the studio audience laughs.
[01:08:42.403 --> 01:08:45.264]  Or like, Mr. President, we need you to get this done.
[01:08:45.264 --> 01:08:46.264]  He's like, I don't know.
[01:08:46.264 --> 01:08:48.405]  I've got to call Putin first.
[01:08:48.405 --> 01:08:54.786]  That's supposedly funny, over and over again, that Trump's getting orders from Putin.
[01:08:54.786 --> 01:09:02.368]  And then they had a New York Times article, well they had a whole bunch last week, saying, chances are Trump's controlled by Putin.
[01:09:03.786 --> 01:09:20.155]  I mean, it's one thing to have senile, crazy Nancy Pelosi or Maxine Waters up there saying the idea for the swamp, and the idea Trump didn't come up with that, Putin gets on the phone and puts it in his ear.
[01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:23.096]  That is ridiculous!
[01:09:23.096 --> 01:09:23.797]  But nevertheless,
[01:09:24.906 --> 01:09:45.971]  Despite the fact the Democratic Party is up to their eyeballs with all this Russian collusion, they just keep saying anybody that opposes them as a Russian agent, including Tucker Carlson, Senator Rand Paul, myself, Matt Drudge, DrudgeReport.com, Breitbart, who else?
[01:09:45.971 --> 01:09:47.451]  Well, the entire Trump administration.
[01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:53.919]  Now there it is.
[01:09:53.919 --> 01:09:58.582]  Odds are Russia owns Trump.
[01:09:58.582 --> 01:10:04.064]  I mean, oh, odds are I'm a monkey's uncle.
[01:10:04.064 --> 01:10:11.968]  Odds are when this writer, Michael Goldberg, sits down, he craps out Tiffany cufflinks.
[01:10:11.968 --> 01:10:20.352]  Odds are at the end of every rainbow is a pot of gold and a Lucky Charms creature.
[01:10:20.352 --> 01:10:21.573]  So this is your chance
[01:10:22.591 --> 01:10:27.394]  So set me straight, and they tell me that nobody's calling and it really disagrees.
[01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:30.316]  So, so, Ali was asking, can they just slightly disagree?
[01:10:30.316 --> 01:10:40.624]  Yeah, as long as you're serious, tell me how I'm a Russian agent, how Trump's a Russian agent, or how we work in collusion, or how I get my info from the Russians.
[01:10:40.624 --> 01:10:46.708]  You think I get anything from the Russians?
[01:10:46.708 --> 01:10:52.172]  What I do have is probably ADHD, and I've just got too much news here to cover, it makes my head want to explode.
[01:10:54.321 --> 01:10:59.207]  So, I want to get this out front, but I also want to ask regular listeners.
[01:10:59.207 --> 01:11:06.997]  What happens if they do indict Trump from the swamp, from the kangaroo grand jury, out of D.C., with Mueller?
[01:11:08.288 --> 01:11:13.492]  And then you've got all this collusion with Mueller and the Clintons for real with Russia.
[01:11:13.492 --> 01:11:19.636]  It will force real criminal investigations of the Clintons that will bring them down.
[01:11:19.636 --> 01:11:36.689]  But they're so arrogant, and they've got so many people dug in in the Justice Department, they believe they can weather that storm, somehow get Trump in trouble for non-existent Russia collusion, while they're getting hundreds of millions of dollars from the Russians and transferring our strategic uranium and more to them.
[01:11:39.445 --> 01:11:41.426]  So that's the question.
[01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:43.248]  How does all that work out?
[01:11:43.248 --> 01:11:50.512]  And it really hit me when I was asking the question earlier today, when I first gave the number out last segment.
[01:11:50.512 --> 01:11:57.237]  If they can't retake the House, they're not going to get the indictment for impeachment to have the trial in the Senate.
[01:11:58.390 --> 01:12:01.151]  And they don't have a chance in hell.
[01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:11.136]  And if they don't get the recovery scuttled, if they can't beach our recovery, if they can't wreck that, they're not gonna get the house.
[01:12:11.136 --> 01:12:16.358]  And so, they don't have a very good chance of executing this, but here's the problem.
[01:12:18.544 --> 01:12:35.969]  They could cause a civil war or they could kill the president and they're making every indication and every noise and every activity and every signature, every wavelength, every indicator that they are planning to kill the president.
[01:12:35.969 --> 01:12:44.331]  Or have a palace coup under the 25th amendment and declare that he's mentally ill, which we first broke nine months ago they were going to start and now you see him doing it.
[01:12:46.223 --> 01:12:53.629]  And just like Project Veritas, just got more video last week inside the Washington Post, where they're going, listen, there is no Russian stuff, but we're ordered to make it up.
[01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:56.391]  This thing's a total hoax.
[01:12:56.391 --> 01:12:59.474]  You got CNN saying the same thing in undercover videos.
[01:12:59.474 --> 01:13:14.686]  Well, in the same kind of meetings we learned, Roger Stone learned from the New York Times and the Washington Post, that they said, well, after all this sex stuff fails and the Russian thing fails, we're going to go with the fact that he has early onset neurological disorder,
[01:13:18.609 --> 01:13:23.850]  That he's got some type of Alzheimer's-type dementia.
[01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:29.432]  And they're in the meetings talking about the bull!
[01:13:29.432 --> 01:13:31.892]  So that's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:31.892 --> 01:13:34.113]  That's the problem, is that they don't know when to quit.
[01:13:34.113 --> 01:13:42.455]  They tried to steal the election, they did steal it from Bernie, they tried to steal the nomination, they tried to block Trump from being seated as president, and they're just back, like herpes.
[01:13:43.803 --> 01:13:50.270]  They will not go away, and Hillary's openly making noises about running again in two and a half years!
[01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:55.495]  Yeah, we're already a year into the Trump presidency.
[01:13:55.495 --> 01:13:59.519]  We're already 13 months since he got elected.
[01:13:59.519 --> 01:14:01.541]  We're like 11 months since he got inaugurated.
[01:14:04.972 --> 01:14:14.237]  And they have every intention of not just overthrowing Trump, but politically overthrowing our entire America First movement.
[01:14:14.237 --> 01:14:15.457]  They intend to outlaw it.
[01:14:15.457 --> 01:14:16.538]  They intend to shut it down.
[01:14:16.538 --> 01:14:17.718]  They intend to censor it.
[01:14:17.718 --> 01:14:18.459]  And they're doing it!
[01:14:18.459 --> 01:14:22.601]  We're seeing much worse censorship on the internet than we saw during the whole campaign.
[01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:30.705]  Because now they're really desperate, and now they're willing to go for broke, and that's what's so crazy, is that we're now facing a crazed enemy.
[01:14:31.385 --> 01:14:45.677]  That has got the general public that's on their side, 30-40% of the public, that literally believes this whole narrative and is ready to start fights with people at restaurants and grocery stores and on the streets.
[01:14:45.677 --> 01:14:58.829]  There were a bunch of really wimpy Democrat lobbyists, I learned who they were from the owner of the restaurant, who were walking over to our table Saturday night when I was there with like 10 UFC fighters, some of them world champs,
[01:15:00.225 --> 01:15:09.394]  And saying F you to me and then looking at the table and saying an F all you!
[01:15:09.394 --> 01:15:20.924]  And that's a perfect allegory of these wimpy Democrats, 55, 60 years old with earrings and long hair and they're, you know, they're trophy wives.
[01:15:20.924 --> 01:15:22.646]  I'm not against earrings and men and long hair.
[01:15:22.646 --> 01:15:24.848]  My point is they were really kind of soy boys.
[01:15:25.965 --> 01:15:30.008]  Walking over to go F you, and then, by the way, F all of you too.
[01:15:30.008 --> 01:15:36.333]  Everybody's just like, then they come back by the table and say F you, and they come back by the table and say F you.
[01:15:36.333 --> 01:15:40.756]  And finally went and complained to the manager, and he went over and told them they quit.
[01:15:40.756 --> 01:15:49.083]  But, it's just, they just want to point the finger like Nazis at us and say we're the bad guys, when all we're trying to do is get the country back under U.S.
[01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:51.665]  control, not foreign multinational control.
[01:15:51.665 --> 01:15:53.406]  You guys aren't part of the power structure.

[01:20:28.445 --> 01:20:30.046]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:30.046 --> 01:20:31.847]  I'm going directly to your phone calls.
[01:20:31.847 --> 01:20:34.489]  Coming up the next segment, Senator Graham.
[01:20:34.489 --> 01:20:37.211]  It's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:20:37.211 --> 01:20:38.372]  See the video.
[01:20:38.372 --> 01:20:39.513]  Time to start moving U.S.
[01:20:39.513 --> 01:20:42.075]  military families out of South Korea.
[01:20:43.317 --> 01:20:44.018]  As the U.S.
[01:20:44.018 --> 01:20:49.964]  orders largest ever military drill to simulate war with North Korea.
[01:20:49.964 --> 01:20:57.612]  Boy, if that kicks off, we should get some more military experts on and talk about what that's going to look like and what's going to unfold there.
[01:20:57.612 --> 01:21:04.840]  So while we're all talking about Russian collusion and all this made up baloney and fake news, and how they want to impeach the president,
[01:21:06.152 --> 01:21:08.193]  We've got North Korea really looming.
[01:21:08.193 --> 01:21:13.956]  That's some of the news that's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:21:13.956 --> 01:21:17.678]  And remember, they don't want those videos, those articles shared.
[01:21:17.678 --> 01:21:23.622]  So the only way the articles get out and around the censors is when you share it.
[01:21:23.622 --> 01:21:32.627]  And then also coming up, remember the lady that got shot and killed by the illegal alien who'd been deported five times and committed all those crimes?
[01:21:36.505 --> 01:21:45.569]  The lawyer for him, he got him off, even though he admits he shot her, lionized him and says he's a great guy and was never violent.
[01:21:45.569 --> 01:21:48.610]  So it's not enough he didn't get a manslaughter charge.
[01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:52.732]  I mean, you accidentally shoot somebody, you get a manslaughter charge.
[01:21:52.732 --> 01:21:53.812]  You don't even get that.
[01:21:53.812 --> 01:21:58.254]  It's just, it's just totally sick.
[01:21:58.254 --> 01:22:01.716]  So that's coming up in the broadcast as well.
[01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:02.456]  If you just joined us,
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:24.024]  I'm taking phone calls now from people that disagree with me and really think that there's some evidence of Russia being behind the 2016 win, and then specifically I'm also asking other listeners that are calling in, how do they think they're going to get the indictment in the House, and then what would happen in the Senate
[01:22:26.226 --> 01:22:28.229]  And then what about all their real Russia collusion?
[01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:30.252]  They just think they're not going to get in trouble?
[01:22:30.252 --> 01:22:37.883]  And have the very people that ran the Russia collusion for Obama and the Clintons now running the Russia collusion investigation?
[01:22:37.883 --> 01:22:40.006]  This is so satirical!
[01:22:40.006 --> 01:22:41.568]  If somebody wrote a satire novel
[01:22:42.469 --> 01:23:01.717]  Where the guy running the investigation is in secret meetings with the Russians, giving them uranium, and cutting down criminal investigations of the State Department head, getting millions of dollars to give Russia our uranium, and then the same FBI guy is in bed with a bunch of Russian companies, and then it just gets worse from there.
[01:23:01.717 --> 01:23:02.978]  You'd say, that's ridiculous!
[01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.138]  That would never happen!
[01:23:04.138 --> 01:23:07.339]  Well, it is happening!
[01:23:07.339 --> 01:23:08.520]  I'm going to your phone calls, but...
[01:23:09.898 --> 01:23:11.618]  If you just joined us, here's the headlines.
[01:23:11.618 --> 01:23:17.400]  Is President Trump's legal team preparing for an imminent obstruction of justice charge?
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:20.161]  NBC News, Feinstein.
[01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:26.382]  Senate Russia probe, building obstruction case against Trump.
[01:23:26.382 --> 01:23:32.824]  Meanwhile, they're saying the evidence they've got is the Logan Act.
[01:23:32.824 --> 01:23:36.785]  Trump's not violating the Logan Act, and that's something the Democrats do violate.
[01:23:38.186 --> 01:23:41.068]  Bilderberg, Davos, all of it.
[01:23:41.068 --> 01:23:45.332]  When the National Security Advisor is calling up world leaders, that's what you're supposed to do!
[01:23:45.332 --> 01:23:48.975]  But again, they prey on the ignorance of their voters.
[01:23:52.366 --> 01:23:56.871]  That's why Democrats always talk about how dumb conservatives are, because that's their weak point.
[01:23:56.871 --> 01:24:04.298]  The average Democrat, we have the video all over the country, is the most servile, stupid, hateful moron.
[01:24:04.298 --> 01:24:06.480]  You've seen the Hillary Clinton book signings.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.841]  We send out reporters politely.
[01:24:08.664 --> 01:24:15.368]  Women come over like sea hag goblins and start cussing and screaming and attacking.
[01:24:15.368 --> 01:24:19.710]  And it's like almost every woman is nastier than the last woman.
[01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:22.171]  And it's like, good God, where did they raise these people?
[01:24:22.171 --> 01:24:25.753]  Under rocks?
[01:24:25.753 --> 01:24:32.237]  Slovenly, lazy, stupid, entitled, hateful.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:42.545]  And they believe they're in an existential war with Christians, and if they can just dominate America that they fed off of, then somehow they'd be somebody.
[01:24:42.545 --> 01:24:47.848]  That's the whole existential struggle they're in.
[01:24:47.848 --> 01:24:50.289]  They're just sacks of trash.
[01:24:50.289 --> 01:24:53.070]  And they hate us!
[01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:54.311]  They're like hordes of zombies.
[01:24:54.311 --> 01:24:57.553]  They just... They just hate the living.
[01:24:57.553 --> 01:25:00.494]  They hate those that are informed.
[01:25:00.494 --> 01:25:01.175]  Alright, Ken...
[01:25:02.421 --> 01:25:07.383]  Kevin, Terrence, Aaron, Chad, John.
[01:25:07.383 --> 01:25:09.364]  Does any of these people disagree?
[01:25:09.364 --> 01:25:10.524]  Maybe Kevin does.
[01:25:10.524 --> 01:25:15.146]  Kevin and Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:25:15.146 --> 01:25:19.428]  Yeah, Alex, I've listened to you longer than the NSA has and watched your show.
[01:25:19.428 --> 01:25:26.410]  And I have to say, you're probably the worst double-speaking liar there is.
[01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:28.311]  And I can prove it.
[01:25:28.311 --> 01:25:30.232]  The first thing is, when it comes to Russia,
[01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:34.692]  There's one thing that you could do to prove it, but you won't.
[01:25:34.692 --> 01:25:43.497]  Release your finances and prove to your audience where your money actually comes from.
[01:25:43.497 --> 01:25:44.878]  Keep going.
[01:25:44.878 --> 01:25:55.884]  Okay, the second, as far as doublespeak goes, I mean, you already said on Joe Rogan's podcast that you were pressured by your advertisers to lie about Y2K.
[01:25:57.458 --> 01:26:04.881]  You said that Russia launched intercontinental ballistic missiles against the United States.
[01:26:04.881 --> 01:26:13.184]  Now, another reason why you're probably tied to Russia is you don't call Vladimir Putin a literal demon.
[01:26:13.184 --> 01:26:18.986]  Just like you call Hillary now, you called Putin back then a literal demon.
[01:26:18.986 --> 01:26:19.786]  Okay, hold on.
[01:26:19.786 --> 01:26:22.387]  That's a lot for me to remember, so let me just go through each one first.
[01:26:23.599 --> 01:26:33.106]  I've told the story about not knowing how real Y2K would be, and how the Navy said it was all going to crash, and how the government first put out that it was going to be this real thing.
[01:26:33.106 --> 01:26:35.788]  And then I didn't believe it was real for a while.
[01:26:35.788 --> 01:26:41.752]  And then by the end, sponsors and listeners convinced me that, OK, maybe something's going to happen.
[01:26:41.752 --> 01:26:43.173]  Then ABC News reported.
[01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:49.475]  That an intercontinental ballistic missile was fired from Russia and may have malfunctioned on Y2K.
[01:26:49.475 --> 01:26:57.284]  William Cooper and others edited the tapes together for me like on air 18 hours that day to make it like some five minute tape to sound completely insane.
[01:26:57.284 --> 01:26:59.466]  So that's fake news.
[01:26:59.466 --> 01:27:00.687]  The other thing is released my...
[01:27:01.448 --> 01:27:02.189]  Finances?
[01:27:02.189 --> 01:27:03.649]  We'll release your finances.
[01:27:03.649 --> 01:27:04.170]  What does that mean?
[01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:06.671]  Like, show us Russia isn't giving you money.
[01:27:06.671 --> 01:27:08.572]  Russia's giving me zero money.
[01:27:08.572 --> 01:27:11.234]  I'm financed by the listeners buying products.
[01:27:11.234 --> 01:27:14.896]  And last time I checked, I think we have almost no orders going into Russia.
[01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.117]  The UK orders a lot of stuff.
[01:27:16.117 --> 01:27:17.437]  Canada orders a lot of stuff.
[01:27:17.437 --> 01:27:18.598]  Mexico orders a lot of stuff.
[01:27:20.439 --> 01:27:26.621]  Strangely enough, France orders a lot of stuff, and Japan and Australia, they still pay, you know, the fact that it's expensive to get stuff over there.
[01:27:26.621 --> 01:27:35.704]  I'm trying to set up a European division and an Australian division, that's coming next, you know, so that we can actually have product in warehouses there to make it better for folks, but, I mean...
[01:27:36.952 --> 01:27:46.259]  Again, you literally, you literally... Because see, if I say something on the biggest podcast in the world, it's not like I'm saying it in secret.
[01:27:46.259 --> 01:27:47.240]  I always see the headlines.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.082]  Jones caught smoking pot!
[01:27:50.082 --> 01:27:53.385]  We caught him on a podcast that had 45 million viewers.
[01:27:53.385 --> 01:27:59.069]  It's like saying, Jones got caught, you know, in the Super Bowl.
[01:27:59.069 --> 01:28:02.232]  If I was in the Super Bowl, I got caught throwing a football.
[01:28:02.232 --> 01:28:05.675]  I mean, it's just these little weird semantical games
[01:28:06.991 --> 01:28:09.374]  That people engage in are just bizarre.
[01:28:09.374 --> 01:28:12.639]  I mean, where's the evidence of Trump and Russia?
[01:28:12.639 --> 01:28:15.182]  Where's the evidence that I'm involved with Russia?
[01:28:15.182 --> 01:28:21.151]  Do you literally, actually with a straight face, Kevin, do you believe that I have some connection to Russia?
[01:28:21.789 --> 01:28:24.111]  So Alex, I'm going to take you up on your deal.
[01:28:24.111 --> 01:28:28.034]  I will release my finances and you will have to do the same.
[01:28:28.034 --> 01:28:30.375]  You just said it to your whole audience.
[01:28:30.375 --> 01:28:31.977]  Hey, hey, hey, listen, bro.
[01:28:31.977 --> 01:28:32.897]  You have nothing.
[01:28:32.897 --> 01:28:34.739]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:34.739 --> 01:28:35.399]  You've got your proof.
[01:28:35.399 --> 01:28:36.480]  I appreciate your call.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.361]  There you go, folks.
[01:28:38.361 --> 01:28:38.882]  There you go.
[01:28:38.882 --> 01:28:40.283]  I said Russia fired a missile.
[01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:44.570]  And then I must be paid by the Russians.
[01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:45.671]  They have nothing.
[01:28:45.671 --> 01:28:46.891]  They have no facts.
[01:28:46.891 --> 01:28:49.832]  We're gonna make America great again whether you like it or not.
[01:28:49.832 --> 01:28:51.192]  Have fun up there in Canada, bro.
[01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:56.493]  We'll be back with more calls.
[01:28:56.493 --> 01:28:59.594]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?
[01:28:59.594 --> 01:29:01.134]  Big Berkey water filters!
[01:29:01.134 --> 01:29:03.074]  Yes, the gift of clean water.
[01:29:03.074 --> 01:29:07.735]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[01:29:07.735 --> 01:29:11.276]  A Big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[01:29:11.576 --> 01:29:15.300]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:20.825]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[01:29:20.825 --> 01:29:24.849]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require.
[01:29:24.849 --> 01:29:29.834]  And are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated or even stagnant pond water.
[01:29:30.214 --> 01:29:36.860]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:30.281]  I think so.
[01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:01.894]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:01.894 --> 01:33:22.792]  Coming to you live from the ATX Broadcasting Worldwide.
[01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:28.131]  You take a mortal man.
[01:33:28.131 --> 01:33:30.411]  You take a mortal man.
[01:33:30.411 --> 01:33:35.072]  Put him in control.
[01:33:35.072 --> 01:33:37.793]  And put him in control.
[01:33:37.793 --> 01:33:41.734]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and the great Dave Mustaine is bringing us in.
[01:33:41.734 --> 01:33:44.415]  Watch him become a god.
[01:33:44.415 --> 01:33:48.576]  Watch people's heads a-roll.
[01:33:48.576 --> 01:33:51.696]  Watch people's heads a-roll.
[01:33:51.696 --> 01:33:54.017]  Just like the Pied Piper let rats loose.
[01:33:55.191 --> 01:34:04.013]  Okay, I'm going to try to settle down because I get in here under the bright lights and I've got all this huge news and I tend to just let the whole show go by without getting a bunch of calls.
[01:34:04.013 --> 01:34:10.815]  I'm going to try to scientifically, bam, bam, bam, go to your calls as quickly as possible.
[01:34:10.815 --> 01:34:20.078]  We just took a call from somebody that was going to give me evidence of my Russia connections and he had none.
[01:34:20.078 --> 01:34:22.339]  It's ridiculous.
[01:34:22.339 --> 01:34:23.419]  The Cold War is over.
[01:34:24.412 --> 01:34:26.674]  Ideologically, Russia is more like the U.S.
[01:34:26.674 --> 01:34:28.295]  used to be.
[01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:33.678]  We face the same globalist foes, multinational corporations that want to control our countries.
[01:34:33.678 --> 01:34:36.460]  That's the only connection we have with Russia.
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:40.743]  And I do share Russia's views on getting away from globalism.
[01:34:40.743 --> 01:34:45.066]  And I don't buy all the hype about Vladimir Putin because I've investigated it myself.
[01:34:46.038 --> 01:34:53.544]  It's the same mainstream media lying about me that lies about Putin, and I'm certainly not lionizing Vladimir Putin.
[01:34:53.544 --> 01:34:55.726]  The point is, most of it's a load of bull.
[01:34:55.726 --> 01:34:56.967]  That's their country.
[01:34:56.967 --> 01:34:58.308]  This is my country.
[01:34:58.308 --> 01:35:04.273]  The Communist Chinese are the ones that have bought off a lot of our media, that are starting to control Hollywood.
[01:35:04.273 --> 01:35:10.559]  They're the big issue.
[01:35:10.559 --> 01:35:10.719]  So.
[01:35:13.834 --> 01:35:33.409]  Before I go back to your calls, just briefly here, I do want to remind listeners that we are under globalist attack for a good reason, because we're effective, we understand what's going on, and we're promoting freedom worldwide, and we're exposing the globalist program.
[01:35:33.409 --> 01:35:37.672]  So if you do support the broadcast at InfoWarsTore.com, it's a big deal.
[01:35:38.988 --> 01:35:47.193]  DNA Force is an amazing product and it's been sold out for a while.
[01:35:47.193 --> 01:35:57.300]  It's back in stock and it's got a 96% vote rate with readers, with listeners, with viewers who've tried it and who've taken it.
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:00.001]  Similar formulations sold by medical clinics are $300 to $600.
[01:36:00.001 --> 01:36:00.862]  It's a good deal at $149.
[01:36:05.734 --> 01:36:06.775]  It's $99.
[01:36:06.775 --> 01:36:18.226]  You're talking $50 or more, depending on which formulation, it varies each time, how much stuff cost us, sometimes $45, sometimes $60, of product in DNA Force.
[01:36:18.226 --> 01:36:21.750]  So when it's $99.95, it's a great deal.
[01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:27.515]  It's now back in stock for a very limited time, and I want to sell it out here in the next week.
[01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.817]  More isn't coming in until sometime
[01:36:30.754 --> 01:36:31.735]  Next year.
[01:36:31.735 --> 01:36:38.518]  And we're doing a re-formulation, by the way, so this is the last of this formulae of DNA Force.
[01:36:38.518 --> 01:36:43.661]  Also, we have several new specials we're running this week.
[01:36:43.661 --> 01:36:51.385]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, empowered with Cloyl Silver and Iodine.
[01:36:52.884 --> 01:36:54.605]  It is 50% off.
[01:36:54.605 --> 01:36:55.725]  Super Blue.
[01:36:55.725 --> 01:36:57.906]  Fluoride-free toothpaste for adults and children.
[01:36:57.906 --> 01:36:59.187]  Two different formulas.
[01:36:59.187 --> 01:37:02.348]  Also, vitamin and mineral fusion with all the amino acids and everything.
[01:37:02.348 --> 01:37:03.248]  Fruit punch flavor.
[01:37:03.248 --> 01:37:04.289]  Totally natural.
[01:37:04.289 --> 01:37:06.250]  Organic.
[01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:12.832]  50% off at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:12.832 --> 01:37:17.574]  And your purchase of those products, again, funds this entire operation.
[01:37:17.574 --> 01:37:21.096]  So I want to thank you for doing it and putting up with me.
[01:37:21.096 --> 01:37:21.376]  I took
[01:37:23.214 --> 01:37:31.356]  One of my daughters had her tooth removed this morning because it had never come out and the tooth was coming in above it going into the other tooth.
[01:37:31.356 --> 01:37:33.457]  So I took her in.
[01:37:33.457 --> 01:37:34.657]  I've never met the dentist.
[01:37:34.657 --> 01:37:38.418]  They've been there four or five times the last few years, but I've never met the dentist.
[01:37:38.418 --> 01:37:41.059]  Dentist come out, shook my hand, was a listener.
[01:37:41.059 --> 01:37:43.120]  They had the anesthesiologist
[01:37:44.175 --> 01:37:46.076]  It's under regulations and laws now.
[01:37:46.076 --> 01:37:51.197]  Even if somebody gets put on laughing gas, they have an anesthesiologist there to do it, because of all the lawsuits and stuff.
[01:37:51.197 --> 01:38:00.799]  He was a listener, got a photo with me, and it was just very humbling that professionals all over are listening to the show.
[01:38:00.799 --> 01:38:05.361]  Because I'll be honest, sometimes I think the show's good, but half the time I'm sick of hearing my voice.
[01:38:05.361 --> 01:38:09.662]  That's why I have a lot of guests on and other talk show hosts and stuff, because I want to build something that's more diverse.
[01:38:09.662 --> 01:38:12.243]  But we're winning.
[01:38:12.243 --> 01:38:13.383]  When everywhere I go,
[01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:20.533]  We run into people that are big fans of the show and that, you know, tell me about what was on the show just yesterday.
[01:38:20.533 --> 01:38:32.219]  So there are a minority of people, mainly white yuppies who are entitled, who will lash out at myself or you or others for promoting freedom, but they are the dwindling minority.
[01:38:32.219 --> 01:38:34.421]  So there is a lot of hope.
[01:38:34.421 --> 01:38:42.565]  And as long as the economy is growing and we have optimism and we know what a fraud this Russia investigation is, we know it's not going anywhere.
[01:38:46.155 --> 01:38:51.496]  But the question is, then what are they going to do as they get more and more angry and more and more violent?
[01:38:51.496 --> 01:38:53.556]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:38:53.556 --> 01:38:55.037]  Hashtag Black Lives Matter.
[01:38:55.037 --> 01:38:56.717]  Hashtag kill the cops.
[01:38:56.717 --> 01:38:59.917]  Hashtag go out and beat people up.
[01:38:59.917 --> 01:39:02.138]  Just because you politically disagree with them.
[01:39:02.138 --> 01:39:04.518]  I mean, what's going to happen with these people?
[01:39:04.518 --> 01:39:05.398]  That's a big question.
[01:39:05.398 --> 01:39:08.039]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls now.
[01:39:08.039 --> 01:39:09.639]  Terrence in Washington.
[01:39:09.639 --> 01:39:10.259]  You're on the air.
[01:39:10.259 --> 01:39:10.599]  Go ahead.
[01:39:10.599 --> 01:39:12.380]  Thanks for calling.
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:12.700]  Hi Alex.
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:13.980]  How are you doing?
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:14.340]  Good, brother.
[01:39:15.785 --> 01:39:19.288]  Hey, me and my girlfriend Sabrina have been listeners for a long time.
[01:39:19.288 --> 01:39:20.990]  I've been listening a lot longer.
[01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:24.272]  Now, this is just what I like to say to you, Alex, as a human.
[01:39:24.272 --> 01:39:25.213]  Human to human.
[01:39:25.213 --> 01:39:27.936]  You know about communication contact.
[01:39:27.936 --> 01:39:28.776]  You've taught me.
[01:39:28.776 --> 01:39:32.760]  Now, this is what I gotta say.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:39.746]  You were a lot more passionate about what you were speaking about when you were trying to save the world besides the political-ness.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:41.740]  Defending Trump.
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:48.683]  Now, are you seeing something in your tarot cards that says you need to put all your chips down on Trump?
[01:39:48.683 --> 01:39:52.344]  Or we're doomed to dead?
[01:39:52.344 --> 01:40:01.127]  Or do you see any of the fact that keeping Trump right now is leading this race war and a possible civil war?
[01:40:01.127 --> 01:40:05.648]  Would you give up Trump to keep a civil war from happening?
[01:40:09.891 --> 01:40:14.312]  It's more complex than that.
[01:40:14.312 --> 01:40:16.533]  It's not that I'm perfect or Trump's perfect.
[01:40:16.533 --> 01:40:19.013]  It's that he really is challenging the globalists.
[01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:21.234]  He's destroying their takeover plan of the U.S.
[01:40:21.234 --> 01:40:22.754]  and the world.
[01:40:22.754 --> 01:40:30.155]  And they're trying to destroy him, and they're trying to destroy me in the process, and my family.
[01:40:30.155 --> 01:40:32.376]  And so I'm committed and doubled down
[01:40:35.754 --> 01:40:41.117]  On an issue of loyalty through this because you know someone by their enemies.
[01:40:41.117 --> 01:40:46.139]  And yeah, you say to all the tarot cards show that Trump's the guy.
[01:40:46.139 --> 01:40:47.000]  It's beyond that.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.161]  It's the fight.
[01:40:49.161 --> 01:40:54.843]  I mean, you see how the globalists hate Trump and hate the Liberty Movement and how nationalism is spreading all over the world.
[01:40:54.843 --> 01:41:04.108]  I mean, I'm supporting nationalism in Brazil and nationalism in England and nationalism in areas of Africa and Asia.
[01:41:05.452 --> 01:41:08.894]  Does it mean that UKIP's a perfect party?
[01:41:08.894 --> 01:41:14.718]  Does it mean that the parties in Eastern Europe that are breaking away from the EU, that they're perfect?
[01:41:14.718 --> 01:41:15.379]  No!
[01:41:15.379 --> 01:41:24.945]  But they understand they're under foreign, globalist domination, and the globalists are the big, worldwide, organized tyranny.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.461]  They're the operatives.
[01:41:27.461 --> 01:41:30.424]  They're the ones that are the biggest threat.
[01:41:30.424 --> 01:41:36.750]  And so I admire Trump for having the courage to fight them and getting a foothold and starting to beat them.
[01:41:36.750 --> 01:41:42.735]  And that the fight is so close that I'm putting all my energy in to not hedging my bets.
[01:41:42.735 --> 01:41:47.219]  I mean, I could get up here and only halfway support Trump and not be such a big target.
[01:41:47.219 --> 01:41:50.623]  But I want to be a big target, just like he is.
[01:41:50.623 --> 01:41:51.844]  I want to give my full
[01:41:53.439 --> 01:41:59.081]  Effort and commitment and not half measures in this historical time we're in.
[01:41:59.081 --> 01:42:00.441]  I want to be counted.
[01:42:00.441 --> 01:42:03.162]  I want my John Hancock on the Declaration of Independence.
[01:42:03.162 --> 01:42:06.643]  Do you think all the people on that Declaration of Independence liked each other?
[01:42:06.643 --> 01:42:07.984]  Or agreed with each other?
[01:42:07.984 --> 01:42:08.924]  Or they were all perfect?
[01:42:08.924 --> 01:42:09.424]  No.
[01:42:09.424 --> 01:42:11.765]  But they were up against an empire that had never been defeated.
[01:42:11.765 --> 01:42:15.226]  And they were sick of being ruled by an outside power.
[01:42:15.226 --> 01:42:19.448]  And they put it all on the line and they were successful and they were victorious.
[01:42:20.268 --> 01:42:22.291]  And so I smell victory.
[01:42:22.291 --> 01:42:23.974]  I smelled it three years ago.
[01:42:23.974 --> 01:42:25.196]  You've seen it happen.
[01:42:25.196 --> 01:42:27.199]  Now you see the economy coming back.
[01:42:27.199 --> 01:42:30.364]  Now you see all the changes.
[01:42:30.364 --> 01:42:32.267]  And so the proof is in the pudding.
[01:42:33.174 --> 01:42:34.395]  We were already conquered.
[01:42:34.395 --> 01:42:37.259]  They're threatening civil war because they want control again.
[01:42:37.259 --> 01:42:39.461]  They're the outside power.
[01:42:39.461 --> 01:42:46.309]  We kick the globalists out, then we can debate things politically and not be so committed one way or the other.
[01:42:46.309 --> 01:42:48.711]  But right now, this is life and death for this country.
[01:42:48.711 --> 01:42:49.532]  Stay there, Terrence.
[01:42:49.532 --> 01:42:51.354]  I'm going to come back and get your response to that.
[01:42:51.354 --> 01:42:53.357]  Then John, Jennifer, Chad, and others.
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:07.707]  Top scientists and researchers agree we are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:43:07.707 --> 01:43:09.047]  So what do we do about it?
[01:43:09.047 --> 01:43:12.169]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:43:12.369 --> 01:43:20.093]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged BrainForce Plus and feel the rush without the crash.
[01:43:20.093 --> 01:43:26.316]  BrainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[01:43:26.316 --> 01:43:34.220]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extract that gives you an added kick.
[01:43:35.041 --> 01:43:47.734]  Other ingredients include vitamin B12 and neurological tonic and cognitive enhancers that will allow you to flip the switch and supercharge your state of mind.
[01:43:47.734 --> 01:43:49.056]  It's the real deal.
[01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:50.798]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:43:50.798 --> 01:43:54.121]  Secure your bottle right now at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:43:56.263 --> 01:43:57.004]  I'm so excited.
[01:43:57.004 --> 01:44:07.230]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:07.230 --> 01:44:12.734]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:12.734 --> 01:44:15.736]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:15.736 --> 01:44:24.522]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:26.603 --> 01:44:46.188]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:46.188 --> 01:44:48.889]  It is amazing!
[01:44:48.889 --> 01:44:53.850]  Red Pill, now available at Infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:44:56.786 --> 01:44:57.006]  I think?
[01:45:17.549 --> 01:45:26.116]  We have a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[01:45:26.116 --> 01:45:31.140]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:41.428]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[01:45:41.428 --> 01:45:46.813]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[01:45:47.273 --> 01:45:56.281]  When you purchase it at M4WarStore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:45:57.819 --> 01:46:00.400]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:15.006]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:46:15.006 --> 01:46:22.549]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:46:23.089 --> 01:46:34.253]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:46:34.253 --> 01:46:40.415]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:46:40.415 --> 01:46:43.116]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[01:46:43.676 --> 01:46:50.521]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[01:46:50.521 --> 01:46:58.527]  That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:58.527 --> 01:47:01.189]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:07.557 --> 01:47:17.752]  Silverbell, Silverbell, it's Christmas time.
[01:47:30.718 --> 01:47:34.441]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:47:34.441 --> 01:47:36.002]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:47:36.002 --> 01:47:37.643]  It's Monday, December 4th, 2017.
[01:47:37.643 --> 01:47:40.525]  We're going right back to your phone calls.
[01:47:40.525 --> 01:47:45.329]  Terrence, who we're going back to, asked the question, if you just joined us, what would it take for you to basically turn on Trump?
[01:47:47.125 --> 01:47:52.187]  Well I'd have to turn on myself to do that because I want our sovereignty back.
[01:47:52.187 --> 01:47:54.168]  I want control of our nation back.
[01:47:54.168 --> 01:47:59.170]  I don't want NAFTA and GATT and TPP transferring our sovereignty to unelected groups.
[01:47:59.170 --> 01:48:04.272]  It's not fair to turn our coal power off and then let other countries use it.
[01:48:04.272 --> 01:48:10.455]  It's not fair to just leave our borders wide open when those very nations who are exploiting us have borders.
[01:48:10.455 --> 01:48:13.216]  We're just re-establishing that we have a country right now.
[01:48:14.662 --> 01:48:15.742]  And Trump's delivering.
[01:48:15.742 --> 01:48:22.603]  That's why the powerful global forces that own the media have been so desperate to destroy him.
[01:48:22.603 --> 01:48:27.724]  So people ask, would you turn on Trump to avert a civil war?
[01:48:27.724 --> 01:48:30.325]  We're trying to get the country back.
[01:48:30.325 --> 01:48:34.286]  I can't just get on my knees to the globalists and let them run things.
[01:48:34.286 --> 01:48:36.606]  Then it's forced inoculations.
[01:48:36.606 --> 01:48:38.106]  Then it's sensitivity training.
[01:48:38.106 --> 01:48:41.867]  Then it's political correctness brainwashing right out of the Soviet Union.
[01:48:44.189 --> 01:48:46.512]  They're openly announcing total censorship.
[01:48:46.512 --> 01:48:50.917]  They're announcing that your kids belong to the state.
[01:48:50.917 --> 01:48:54.961]  I'm surprised something like Trump didn't come along sooner.
[01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:59.126]  So for me, it's not even a question at all about
[01:49:00.782 --> 01:49:02.504]  Why do I support Trump?
[01:49:02.504 --> 01:49:12.375]  I mean, the Democrats just keep thinking if they threaten me, or cuss at me, or take our sponsors, or try to take my kids away, that I'm somehow going to run off into the dark because I'm scared of them.
[01:49:12.375 --> 01:49:16.799]  It's only going to make me fight harder.
[01:49:16.799 --> 01:49:21.705]  So, I wouldn't betray myself, I wouldn't betray my family, so I wouldn't betray the President.
[01:49:22.984 --> 01:49:27.548]  I've been very critical of him bad-mouthing WikiLeaks when that's what got him elected.
[01:49:27.548 --> 01:49:31.010]  And he said he would appoint somebody to the CDC to investigate vaccines.
[01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:33.492]  He's gone back on that.
[01:49:33.492 --> 01:49:39.337]  And he's done a few other things I don't like, but that's because he's overwhelmed and can't execute perfectly.
[01:49:39.337 --> 01:49:40.738]  I don't expect perfection.
[01:49:40.738 --> 01:49:47.764]  I'm not instant ratification.
[01:49:47.764 --> 01:49:51.307]  But, I mean, I couldn't get done all the stuff Trump's done.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:56.642]  I'm surprised by what he's gotten done.
[01:49:56.642 --> 01:50:04.066]  And then we sit here watching him go through all this hell.
[01:50:04.066 --> 01:50:07.268]  And then we kind of hedge our bets with friends and family.
[01:50:07.268 --> 01:50:08.448]  Oh, yeah, yeah, Trump.
[01:50:08.448 --> 01:50:09.089]  Yeah, whatever.
[01:50:09.089 --> 01:50:22.476]  I mean, I found out that I've known people for years who around me posed that they were libertarians, but behind the scenes hang out with Austin liberals and bad mouth me.
[01:50:24.684 --> 01:50:27.947]  I mean, why not just say you hate Trump and you hate me?
[01:50:27.947 --> 01:50:30.129]  But see, they don't really hate Trump or hate me.
[01:50:30.129 --> 01:50:31.290]  They're just chameleons.
[01:50:31.290 --> 01:50:36.394]  They don't stand for anything!
[01:50:36.394 --> 01:50:37.175]  Well, you know what?
[01:50:37.175 --> 01:50:38.076]  I go out in public.
[01:50:38.076 --> 01:50:39.297]  I go to downtown Austin.
[01:50:39.297 --> 01:50:40.478]  I go eat food right there.
[01:50:40.478 --> 01:50:44.021]  You want to walk up my table and yell and cuss at me and tell me I'm filthy?
[01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:45.783]  Go ahead and you do it.
[01:50:45.783 --> 01:50:48.065]  But you always run off because you don't want to have a discussion.
[01:50:52.042 --> 01:50:59.370]  And you talk about a cult, that's all any of them ever do is come up and say, F you.
[01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:02.913]  And they might add, you Russian agent, you're gonna get it.
[01:51:02.913 --> 01:51:04.695]  And they're shaking.
[01:51:04.695 --> 01:51:13.705]  Because I want to bring our jobs back, and I'm pro-self-defense, and I don't hate America, and I don't hate our military, and I don't want to shoot cops in the back of the head.
[01:51:15.029 --> 01:51:18.573]  People go, man, you used to bash the cops a lot, but now you're like pro-cop.
[01:51:18.573 --> 01:51:23.277]  I wanted to reform the police and not have them be agents of the globalists.
[01:51:23.277 --> 01:51:26.901]  Because they're an important fixture to the country.
[01:51:26.901 --> 01:51:33.187]  Doesn't mean I hate them or want to kill them, because I showed an interest in the police.
[01:51:33.187 --> 01:51:34.969]  I'm not in a gang, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:34.969 --> 01:51:36.531]  I'm not on one side or the other.
[01:51:36.531 --> 01:51:37.852]  I'm trying to promote freedom.
[01:51:41.929 --> 01:51:44.470]  I want to be where Trump is.
[01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:45.790]  I want to be up front.
[01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:47.010]  I want to be on the cutting edge.
[01:51:47.010 --> 01:51:48.551]  I want to be restoring the Republic.
[01:51:48.551 --> 01:51:53.272]  I want to be taking on these tyrants.
[01:51:53.272 --> 01:51:58.234]  Because that's what the men are.
[01:51:58.234 --> 01:52:04.515]  I'm not some person that just flies around like a piece of paper in the wind off what looks popular.
[01:52:04.515 --> 01:52:06.776]  You stick my finger up and see which way the wind's blowing.
[01:52:06.776 --> 01:52:08.977]  I don't do things like that.
[01:52:08.977 --> 01:52:09.757]  I study history.
[01:52:11.104 --> 01:52:20.491]  I study what's happening in the country, I know the issues, and then I try to set a course for what historically produces the best, freest, honorable societies.
[01:52:20.491 --> 01:52:21.352]  And am I perfect?
[01:52:21.352 --> 01:52:22.592]  Absolutely not.
[01:52:22.592 --> 01:52:25.174]  But am I committed to Americana?
[01:52:25.174 --> 01:52:27.496]  Do I believe in what I stand for?
[01:52:27.496 --> 01:52:31.459]  I'm ready to die a thousand times what I believe in.
[01:52:31.459 --> 01:52:33.360]  That's not some big statement either.
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:36.703]  If you're even halfway alive, you better be willing to die for something.
[01:52:38.971 --> 01:52:45.413]  People think being a man is having a bunch of symbols of wealth or acting physically tough around other men.
[01:52:45.413 --> 01:52:47.274]  That's not what a man does.
[01:52:47.274 --> 01:52:52.115]  A man does what's right and doesn't back down in the face of it.
[01:52:52.115 --> 01:52:53.696]  Has commitments.
[01:52:53.696 --> 01:52:54.516]  That's what this is about.
[01:52:54.516 --> 01:53:00.078]  That's why people out there always claim that I'm a fraud or I'm a phony because it's the opposite.
[01:53:00.078 --> 01:53:01.519]  I'm the opposite of a fraud or phony.
[01:53:01.519 --> 01:53:05.280]  I'm willing to do anything to take on these people because I know what they are.
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:08.041]  A bunch of goddamn devil worshiping pedophiles.
[01:53:09.178 --> 01:53:12.821]  And I want to apologize for saying that, because it's not the Lord's name in vain.
[01:53:12.821 --> 01:53:17.565]  I hope God damns these people to hell for eternity!
[01:53:17.565 --> 01:53:19.186]  And I know this!
[01:53:19.186 --> 01:53:31.936]  I'm going to give my full energy and everything I've got, as imperfect as it is, to taking these people on, and I'm going to pour out everything I've got against them!
[01:53:31.936 --> 01:53:36.420]  Because I don't want to be around them or with them and their spirit.
[01:53:37.403 --> 01:53:42.207]  Because my very heart and my guts tells me they're pure death.
[01:53:42.207 --> 01:53:47.130]  They're a bunch of cowardly, backstabbing scum!
[01:53:47.130 --> 01:53:49.152]  And I'm so proud they hate me.
[01:53:49.152 --> 01:53:52.234]  Let me tell you, it's always scum that gets in my face.
[01:53:52.234 --> 01:53:53.875]  It's always, you can always tell.
[01:53:53.875 --> 01:53:55.557]  Oh, look at that table of scum.
[01:53:55.557 --> 01:53:58.219]  They're gonna come over here and say something.
[01:53:58.219 --> 01:54:02.422]  Because they're always a bunch of confused, ninnying, rudderless crap.
[01:54:03.834 --> 01:54:15.299]  They think if they attack somebody that mainstream media hates, somehow they might be somebody by pointing their finger at me and saying, there's the bad guy.
[01:54:15.299 --> 01:54:17.740]  So there's my answer to you, Terrence.
[01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:24.962]  They can put a gun to my head and say, if you don't come out and say you hate Trump, we're going to blow your brains out.
[01:54:24.962 --> 01:54:25.923]  I'd say pull the trigger.
[01:54:26.863 --> 01:54:31.725]  I've already basically had the Democratic Party and the whole structure try to take my children away from me.
[01:54:31.725 --> 01:54:34.006]  I've already had them do things you wouldn't believe behind the scenes.
[01:54:34.006 --> 01:54:34.647]  And you know what?
[01:54:34.647 --> 01:54:36.067]  It doesn't make me cry.
[01:54:36.067 --> 01:54:37.148]  I'm not a victim.
[01:54:37.148 --> 01:54:39.989]  I'm not looking for ways out of this without confrontation.
[01:54:39.989 --> 01:54:42.370]  It makes me go, oh, I'm really getting attacked.
[01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:43.831]  Let's go that direction.
[01:54:43.831 --> 01:54:45.892]  Where's the strongest attack from?
[01:54:45.892 --> 01:54:51.894]  That's my radar guidance system, is to go directly in to where the attack is.
[01:54:51.894 --> 01:54:53.695]  All they're doing is steering me.
[01:54:53.695 --> 01:54:54.956]  Oh man, they're really attacking now.
[01:54:56.374 --> 01:55:00.836]  Like a Geiger counter going right to the source of the radiation.
[01:55:00.836 --> 01:55:04.217]  See, the average person just thinks about themselves, how to get ahead.
[01:55:04.217 --> 01:55:08.019]  When you think like that, you lose everything.
[01:55:08.019 --> 01:55:14.702]  The most selfish thing is to stand up for what's right, because that's what gives you the world.
[01:55:14.702 --> 01:55:15.722]  But that's how God works.
[01:55:15.722 --> 01:55:20.144]  You didn't mean it to be that way, but you got the world because you were willing to lose it all.
[01:55:20.144 --> 01:55:25.847]  These people think you get the world by being willing to lose nothing, and all you end up being is alone.
[01:55:28.208 --> 01:55:33.191]  I'm not going to be with the timid souls that serve evil when I die.
[01:55:33.191 --> 01:55:41.535]  I'm going to run the race, I'm going to blow it out, and when I collapse and I'm dead, I'm going to leave a lot of energy behind against these people.
[01:55:41.535 --> 01:55:46.358]  And that's why they hate us, because they know we know who they are, and we have the will to break them.
[01:55:47.762 --> 01:55:49.985]  And we are going to break them.
[01:55:49.985 --> 01:55:58.177]  And nation-states across the world are going to pull away from world government and pull away from these multinational corporations that are anti-God, anti-family.
[01:55:58.177 --> 01:56:00.360]  And all of you leftists are going to scream in hate.
[01:56:01.718 --> 01:56:06.041]  As from Russia, to the UK, to the US, to you name it, pulls away.
[01:56:06.041 --> 01:56:10.745]  You're all going to scream, oh Austria's voting to leave the EU because they're Russian agents.
[01:56:10.745 --> 01:56:14.708]  Italy's voting to get out of the EU because they're Russian agents.
[01:56:14.708 --> 01:56:22.814]  No, because they want to be their own people and not under some Nazi collaborator's grandson's control, unelected Junker.
[01:56:25.765 --> 01:56:30.548]  See, you have to understand, they're always saying we're Russian collaborators because they're the globalists.
[01:56:30.548 --> 01:56:32.429]  They're the ones killing the nation-state.
[01:56:32.429 --> 01:56:34.751]  They're the ones bashing having American flags.
[01:56:34.751 --> 01:56:38.453]  It's their 9th Circuit saying you can't have an American flag in school.
[01:56:38.453 --> 01:56:39.634]  Not Donald Trump!
[01:56:39.634 --> 01:56:41.615]  They're the ones telling you hate America!
[01:56:41.615 --> 01:56:43.556]  They're the ones telling you the country's bad!
[01:56:43.556 --> 01:56:46.078]  They're the ones telling you piss on your ancestors!
[01:56:46.078 --> 01:56:48.860]  Have no respect!
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:49.961]  They're the enemy!
[01:56:49.961 --> 01:56:51.001]  They're the cancer!
[01:56:51.001 --> 01:56:52.042]  They're the problem!
[01:56:52.042 --> 01:56:53.343]  They're what they say we are!
[01:56:56.015 --> 01:56:58.957]  Does that answer your question, Terrence?
[01:56:58.957 --> 01:57:00.338]  Yeah, I would say you did.
[01:57:00.338 --> 01:57:01.559]  And you know what?
[01:57:01.559 --> 01:57:03.800]  Thank you for the heart in your voice again.
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:04.961]  I need to hear that.
[01:57:04.961 --> 01:57:07.003]  I'm a strong man like you.
[01:57:07.003 --> 01:57:09.744]  I'm a 27-year-old male with a daughter.
[01:57:09.744 --> 01:57:17.250]  I do think to myself, now, Alex Jones, these globalists could kill you.
[01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:18.290]  Who cares about me?
[01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:20.192]  Who cares about you but my daughter?
[01:57:20.192 --> 01:57:21.733]  They threatened to kill my daughter.
[01:57:23.855 --> 01:57:25.557]  How do you respond to that?
[01:57:25.557 --> 01:57:27.238]  You had Globalist threaten to kill your daughter?
[01:57:27.238 --> 01:57:31.401]  No, but I can only imagine if this is what's going on.
[01:57:31.401 --> 01:57:33.302]  I'll tell you why they won't threaten your daughter.
[01:57:33.302 --> 01:57:37.966]  If you have it in your heart to kill anybody that threatens your daughter, they won't do it.
[01:57:37.966 --> 01:57:39.067]  So, you understand?
[01:57:39.067 --> 01:57:42.830]  You've got to be willing to kill for your family so people don't mess with you.
[01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:45.552]  But you've got to have that and they've got to know it.
[01:57:45.552 --> 01:57:53.038]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:57:54.685 --> 01:58:05.516]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:58:05.516 --> 01:58:07.639]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[01:58:21.270 --> 01:58:23.911]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:58:23.911 --> 01:58:26.693]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.

[01:59:48.611 --> 01:59:51.213]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.958 --> 02:00:15.502]  Well, I love taking calls, but they're also exhausting because they challenge me and they take me to places I wasn't thinking about.
[02:00:15.502 --> 02:00:24.007]  I got a ton of important clips, big breaking news this hour, a bunch of stuff I've got to get to, but I am trying to go to your calls as quickly as I can.
[02:00:24.007 --> 02:00:27.770]  You know, caller asked me why am I committed to Trump.
[02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:29.291]  You know a man by his enemies.
[02:00:29.291 --> 02:00:33.294]  This is like biblical, the amount of attacks and the fraud.
[02:00:33.294 --> 02:00:35.775]  And then I'm being attacked right next to him.
[02:00:35.775 --> 02:00:38.657]  If that doesn't create camaraderie, if that...
[02:00:41.690 --> 02:00:52.218]  If that doesn't get you on board with somebody even more, the more attacks there are, it's the opposite of breaking me.
[02:00:52.218 --> 02:00:57.401]  And I just don't ever get the mindset, a lot of people used to think that I was trying to scare folks on air.
[02:00:57.401 --> 02:01:03.446]  And I learned that some of the globalists thought my show wasn't damaging them a decade ago or so because they thought I was just scaring people for them.
[02:01:04.116 --> 02:01:06.857]  Like they think, like scaring you makes you submit.
[02:01:06.857 --> 02:01:09.758]  That's like the Nazis bombing civilian targets.
[02:01:09.758 --> 02:01:16.260]  They thought it would make the British not want to have the war, but it took the Brits from not wanting the war to wanting the war.
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:26.744]  And I just don't ever get tyrants perspective where you do something mean to somebody, at least in my experience where I'm from, makes you want to fight harder.
[02:01:26.744 --> 02:01:28.865]  So that's the perspective I've got here.
[02:01:31.641 --> 02:01:46.890]  As nasty as the enemy is, we've already come so far, ladies and gentlemen, that as nasty as politics was, and as betrayed as it was, and it was all about deception and garbage, as soon as that flips, then it's all about being honorable.
[02:01:46.890 --> 02:01:49.952]  And I can tell you right now, with Trump, it's straight up.
[02:01:49.952 --> 02:01:53.394]  In his policies and behind the scenes, there's not subterfuge.
[02:01:53.394 --> 02:01:55.615]  That's why the politicians and the globalists hate it.
[02:01:55.615 --> 02:01:57.857]  It's just straight up business.
[02:01:57.857 --> 02:01:58.457]  Straight up!
[02:02:04.921 --> 02:02:08.463]  Straight up pragmatism.
[02:02:08.463 --> 02:02:10.604]  It's not even goody-two-shoes.
[02:02:10.604 --> 02:02:12.846]  It's just not deceptive.
[02:02:12.846 --> 02:02:24.833]  And their whole system of hijacking the whole culture and selling it off to the highest bidder and being lords of everything because they're the gatekeepers on humanity's future, that's coming to an end.
[02:02:24.833 --> 02:02:29.696]  And I am very honored to be part, even in my stumbling fashion, to be involved in this.
[02:02:30.771 --> 02:02:33.733]  Alright, Chad, Aaron, Patrick, and many others.
[02:02:33.733 --> 02:02:37.235]  Patrick in Idaho, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:02:37.235 --> 02:02:37.955]  You there?
[02:02:37.955 --> 02:02:39.636]  Yes, I am.
[02:02:39.636 --> 02:02:40.537]  Uh, good.
[02:02:40.537 --> 02:02:57.426]  So, stemming off of yesterday's conversation, I'm Irish, English, German, French, Basque, Indian, whatever.
[02:02:57.426 --> 02:02:58.747]  I'm just an American.
[02:03:01.826 --> 02:03:08.232]  Okay, and I hear you disagree with me on Russia Connection?
[02:03:08.232 --> 02:03:09.993]  No, I don't.
[02:03:09.993 --> 02:03:22.444]  I think if I can spin a little bit off, I think you're a Polish agent.
[02:03:25.114 --> 02:03:27.695]  Okay, and how do you know I'm a Polish agent?
[02:03:41.749 --> 02:03:47.073]  Well, you know, I actually, there are a lot of people with a Polish background that send me Fighting the New World Order, it's true.
[02:03:47.073 --> 02:03:49.454]  And I've got friends that are Polish.
[02:03:49.454 --> 02:03:54.318]  But also, I think Paczynek, from Russia, I mean, a lot of those are just Slavic names.
[02:03:54.318 --> 02:03:59.041]  But, you know, people tell Posobiec that he must be a Russian agent because he's Polish.
[02:03:59.041 --> 02:04:02.023]  Anybody that knows the history knows the Poles don't like the Russians too much.
[02:04:02.023 --> 02:04:03.845]  There's just a lot of ignorance, you know.
[02:04:03.845 --> 02:04:09.168]  Just because somebody has a Slavic last name doesn't mean they're Russian.
[02:04:09.168 --> 02:04:11.090]  I'm just having fun with you, sir.
[02:04:11.653 --> 02:04:12.633]  No, no, Patrick, I hear you.
[02:04:12.633 --> 02:04:14.454]  It sounds like you've had a lot of fun today.
[02:04:14.454 --> 02:04:17.234]  Are you smoking dope or are you drinking alcohol today?
[02:04:17.234 --> 02:04:19.255]  Neither.
[02:04:19.255 --> 02:04:20.135]  OK, well, I got it.
[02:04:20.135 --> 02:04:21.355]  We got to catch up with me.
[02:04:21.355 --> 02:04:22.656]  OK, well, I'm choking.
[02:04:22.656 --> 02:04:23.776]  I got to go.
[02:04:23.776 --> 02:04:25.156]  Man, you're something else.
[02:04:25.156 --> 02:04:25.717]  I got to go.
[02:04:25.717 --> 02:04:28.117]  That color's so ridiculous.
[02:04:28.117 --> 02:04:30.338]  Yeah, but he did bring up some good points, though.
[02:04:31.889 --> 02:04:43.232]  There's been a disproportionate amount of people with Polish last names involved in the Liberty Movement, so don't start a new conspiracy theory that, hey, how about we don't judge people off their last names?
[02:04:43.232 --> 02:04:44.552]  We judge them off what they do?
[02:04:44.552 --> 02:04:49.673]  You know, they're saying Trump's a Nazi because he's got a German last name.
[02:04:49.673 --> 02:04:53.514]  Let's judge people not off what color they are or their last name, but off what they do.
[02:04:55.444 --> 02:04:56.245]  I'm so excited.
[02:04:56.245 --> 02:05:06.411]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[02:05:06.411 --> 02:05:11.915]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:05:11.915 --> 02:05:14.917]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:05:14.917 --> 02:05:23.723]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:05:25.784 --> 02:05:45.379]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:05:45.379 --> 02:05:48.081]  It is amazing!
[02:05:48.081 --> 02:05:53.045]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:05:55.697 --> 02:05:56.999]  We've got it done.
[02:05:56.999 --> 02:06:02.846]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:02.846 --> 02:06:07.232]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:07.232 --> 02:06:12.839]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:15.236 --> 02:06:17.040]  Okay.
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:20.928]  No matter what, I'm going your calls quick and fast right now.
[02:06:20.928 --> 02:06:25.799]  Till the bottom of the hour, then I've got a huge blitz of videos and clips and just insane stuff I need to get to.
[02:06:27.162 --> 02:06:28.843]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-ALEX.
[02:06:28.843 --> 02:06:38.967]  The callers are, some of them have been great, some of them have been okay, some of them have been funny and goofy like the last guy, but what they are is long.
[02:06:38.967 --> 02:06:42.429]  Just get to your point, I'm gonna try to make a quick point and move on.
[02:06:42.429 --> 02:06:46.411]  They have asked some epic questions, so some of my answers have taken, you know, 20 minutes.
[02:06:46.411 --> 02:06:50.112]  So, it's mainly my fault, I apologize, but we're going to your calls.
[02:06:50.112 --> 02:06:51.793]  Aaron, Chad, Frank, and many others.
[02:06:57.008 --> 02:06:58.188]  Who should I go to next?
[02:06:58.188 --> 02:07:00.109]  Let's go to Aaron in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:02.389]  You're on the air.
[02:07:02.389 --> 02:07:03.550]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:07:03.550 --> 02:07:05.050]  Good, brother.
[02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:10.452]  Hey, I just have a little theory about why the left is scratching at straws or Trump will make this fast.
[02:07:10.452 --> 02:07:15.013]  Once Trump started saying that he'll meet North Korea with a fury and fire no one's seen,
[02:07:15.871 --> 02:07:17.411]  They started ramping up things.
[02:07:17.411 --> 02:07:18.692]  Now, what is Fury and Fire?
[02:07:18.692 --> 02:07:30.155]  To me, if you go to Twitter and search Athena, A-T-H-E-N-A, it's Fox News, you'll find a report from Fox about a system using lasers that knocked drones out of the sky.
[02:07:30.155 --> 02:07:38.998]  Now, if Fox is putting that out, to me it seems like the government is willing to show that kind of information that maybe we have even tech up in the skies to watch.
[02:07:39.927 --> 02:07:47.609]  And so the reason why he started talking about this is because none of the globalists wanted to push, you know, nuclear war with North Korea and Russia.
[02:07:47.609 --> 02:07:51.850]  But they stopped that, and now they're trying to push control over satellites.
[02:07:51.850 --> 02:07:53.611]  How is North Korea going to hit us with a nuke?
[02:07:53.611 --> 02:07:58.212]  The only way they could do it is if they were to try to use an EMP to disable our system.
[02:07:58.212 --> 02:07:59.092]  So to me, it just seems like
[02:07:59.713 --> 02:08:08.700]  North Korea and the globalists are trying to push another form of Pearl Harbor where all of a sudden they turn off our communications so we can't even defend ourselves.
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:10.341]  That's just my opinion.
[02:08:10.341 --> 02:08:12.242]  No, I think the experts agree with you.
[02:08:12.242 --> 02:08:17.146]  That's one of the only threats from North Korea that's really serious and it's something North Korea has been looking at.
[02:08:17.146 --> 02:08:23.590]  They don't have delivery systems yet where the missiles don't break up coming into the atmosphere.
[02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:28.494]  And we also know the Clintons and the Chinese and the globalists had a lot of back deals with North Korea.
[02:08:29.813 --> 02:08:32.174]  It's a pleasure to be with you, man.
[02:08:32.174 --> 02:08:39.718]  Yeah, I was talking to the lady there that kind of screamed when I was first called and I was telling her about how this is a spiritual warfare against Trump.
[02:08:58.912 --> 02:09:02.314]  And anybody that's supporting Trump.
[02:09:02.314 --> 02:09:06.136]  And I truly, truly believe, Alex, I've been a Christian all my life.
[02:09:06.136 --> 02:09:08.098]  I'm a disabled veteran.
[02:09:08.098 --> 02:09:25.608]  I come from the deepest coal mining country there is in America, which is southern West Virginia, McDowell County, which has been proven throughout, actually it was more or less in the 50s and 60s, I believe it was, there was more coal that came out of there than any other place in America.
[02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:31.884]  It made the boom for Pittsburgh, the steel... No, I'm fully aware of that.
[02:09:31.884 --> 02:09:36.907]  That area of West Virginia basically built much of our industrial revolution.
[02:09:36.907 --> 02:09:40.390]  Anyway, sorry to get off a little bit of top there, but... No, it's interesting.
[02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:42.271]  It's interesting.
[02:09:42.271 --> 02:09:47.034]  Just wanted to basically just describe where I'm coming from and who I am.
[02:09:47.034 --> 02:09:51.197]  And also, what I want to get at to get to the point, and I know you said we're short on time,
[02:09:52.623 --> 02:09:54.324]  I am a disabled veteran.
[02:09:54.324 --> 02:09:55.965]  I served in Afghanistan.
[02:09:55.965 --> 02:10:04.610]  I'm actually disabled and permanently retired from injuries I sustained in combat in Afghanistan since 9-11.
[02:10:04.610 --> 02:10:14.376]  And I'm super aware of your theories and beliefs on 9-11 and that there was some corruption involved and whatnot.
[02:10:14.376 --> 02:10:19.779]  And without getting into that, what I want to say is that we have spent the past 16 years
[02:10:21.317 --> 02:10:39.789]  Regardless of what your beliefs about 9-11 are, we have spent and invested probably trillions of dollars, I know it's billions, maybe even trillions of dollars into fighting radical Islam for 16 years now.
[02:10:39.789 --> 02:10:47.534]  So, what I want to get at is that that was the boogeyman that was made for us to focus on for the past 16 years.
[02:10:48.951 --> 02:10:52.154]  And I'd like to say it was a well-deserved boogeyman.
[02:10:52.154 --> 02:10:54.996]  It wasn't a fraudulent boogeyman.
[02:10:54.996 --> 02:11:03.983]  What I believe the Democrats and the left loony liberals are now making is Russia being the new boogeyman.
[02:11:03.983 --> 02:11:11.769]  And it's because it fits their agenda with this whole anti-white, anti-Christian, anti-America.
[02:11:11.769 --> 02:11:14.091]  It's impossible for us to continue
[02:11:15.035 --> 02:11:21.259]  Making radical Islam the boogeyman in order to fit their agenda.
[02:11:21.259 --> 02:11:26.862]  Sure, they want total civil war now directed by liberal governments to compartmentalize everybody.
[02:11:26.862 --> 02:11:28.143]  We talk about spiritual warfare.
[02:11:30.154 --> 02:11:38.658]  I mean, they are attacking and intimidating, and all over, white people are getting beat up just because they're white, even if they're not wearing a Trump hat.
[02:11:38.658 --> 02:11:43.921]  And again, this is the leftist media pushing this narrative to control our countries.
[02:11:43.921 --> 02:11:46.202]  Most of the so-called minorities aren't racist.
[02:11:46.202 --> 02:11:48.463]  The media is trying to force them into it.
[02:11:48.463 --> 02:11:52.065]  Most of the Antifa meetings are leftist white people running it.
[02:11:52.065 --> 02:11:56.047]  But it really shows you how cold-blooded they are, and that is their plan.
[02:11:56.807 --> 02:11:57.667]  For divide and conquer.
[02:11:57.667 --> 02:11:58.608]  And you're right.
[02:11:58.608 --> 02:12:00.229]  They radicalized a lot of Islam.
[02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:01.049]  They protected it.
[02:12:01.049 --> 02:12:02.430]  They grew it.
[02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:04.210]  Then they had our military fight it.
[02:12:04.210 --> 02:12:07.112]  To basically wear our military out.
[02:12:07.112 --> 02:12:08.132]  Trump said we're not doing that.
[02:12:08.132 --> 02:12:09.933]  We're actually going to defeat it and it's over.
[02:12:09.933 --> 02:12:12.554]  And then in just 11 months it's almost defeated.
[02:12:12.554 --> 02:12:17.816]  Which again just shows you how there wasn't a real action to actually defeat it.
[02:12:17.816 --> 02:12:20.618]  The globalists were just using it to take away our liberties.
[02:12:20.618 --> 02:12:21.278]  That's another reason
[02:12:22.642 --> 02:12:26.784]  They hate Trump so much as he's derailing that entire program.
[02:12:26.784 --> 02:12:33.708]  And listen, I've been on air 22 years and folks would call in like you and say, Alex, it's spiritual warfare, it's good versus evil.
[02:12:33.708 --> 02:12:36.909]  And I'd say, I know that, but I would not focus much on it.
[02:12:36.909 --> 02:12:41.492]  But as I get older and I research more, at the end of the day, the people we're fighting
[02:12:42.702 --> 02:12:46.163]  Aren't black, they're not white, they're not Hispanic, they're not Asian.
[02:12:46.163 --> 02:13:02.869]  They are all different colors, but they are anti-human psychopaths and sociopaths who are into evil and who don't believe in humanity and who hate their neighbors and who like to lie and like to steal and like to cheat.
[02:13:02.869 --> 02:13:05.970]  And so, yes, we are in a fight of good versus evil.
[02:13:05.970 --> 02:13:08.811]  And you heard the caller ask me earlier, why do you support Trump?
[02:13:09.574 --> 02:13:12.155]  I mean, look at everything coming back.
[02:13:12.155 --> 02:13:13.935]  Look at the globalists hating him.
[02:13:13.935 --> 02:13:15.136]  Look at how they lie.
[02:13:15.136 --> 02:13:16.696]  Look at everything they've done.
[02:13:16.696 --> 02:13:25.179]  It's so obvious, not just intellectually, but from the enemies and what we're seeing happen, that Trump is so real.
[02:13:25.179 --> 02:13:30.200]  And I just, it just gives me hope to know there's not just evil in this world.
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:35.422]  And one thing to top that, Alex, and I just want to add this is because it's always what I hear.
[02:13:36.405 --> 02:13:48.552]  When you hear someone speaking of supporting Trump or that all these Christians supported Trump, and I honestly believe that it was divine for him to be elected president.
[02:13:48.552 --> 02:13:50.994]  I honestly wholeheartedly believe that.
[02:13:51.522 --> 02:14:05.830]  But what you'll hear from the left all the time, these anti-Christian, most people who've never even walked into a church, probably never even opened the Bible in their life, they'll say, oh, how could you support Trump when he's talking about grabbing this and grabbing that?
[02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:09.992]  And after his lifestyle, he's been divorced and this and that.
[02:14:09.992 --> 02:14:17.596]  Listen, for everybody out there listening right now, whoever you are, a Christian is not a saint.
[02:14:18.564 --> 02:14:22.827]  If you are a Christian and you follow God, you read the Bible, you are a Christian.
[02:14:22.827 --> 02:14:25.588]  I've been a Christian since I was five years old.
[02:14:25.588 --> 02:14:26.689]  Let me throw this down.
[02:14:26.689 --> 02:14:27.989]  The Bible's replete.
[02:14:27.989 --> 02:14:29.931]  God judges the heart, not the deeds.
[02:14:29.931 --> 02:14:37.475]  King David got his best friend killed just so he could have sex with his wife, but after he truly repented, God just said, you're a man of your own heart.
[02:14:37.475 --> 02:14:42.418]  Christ said, look at these Pharisees praying up on top of the hill, but behind closed doors they're super evil.
[02:14:43.278 --> 02:14:47.399]  Christ was looking for real people that were good and honorable and strong.
[02:14:47.399 --> 02:14:48.359]  Not that they were perfect.
[02:14:48.359 --> 02:14:49.060]  God made us.
[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:50.100]  God knows us.
[02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:50.940]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:52.000]  Look at the Bible.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.541]  Saul of Tarsus becomes Paul on the road to Damascus.
[02:14:55.541 --> 02:14:57.462]  He was a horrible person.
[02:14:57.462 --> 02:14:59.503]  And Trump's not been a horrible person.
[02:14:59.503 --> 02:15:00.883]  He's a for real guy.
[02:15:00.883 --> 02:15:01.703]  He's out in the open.
[02:15:01.703 --> 02:15:02.783]  He's not perfect.
[02:15:02.783 --> 02:15:05.844]  But he really isn't out to get people.
[02:15:05.844 --> 02:15:07.385]  He doesn't want austerity.
[02:15:07.385 --> 02:15:09.265]  He doesn't want to enslave people.
[02:15:09.265 --> 02:15:10.466]  And that's why the globalists hate him.
[02:15:10.466 --> 02:15:11.166]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:15:12.046 --> 02:15:16.130]  God raises people up, and we've seen providence.
[02:15:16.130 --> 02:15:19.693]  And that's why the evil of Hollywood and the globalists hate Trump so much.
[02:15:19.693 --> 02:15:21.394]  Go ahead.
[02:15:21.394 --> 02:15:21.674]  Amen.
[02:15:21.674 --> 02:15:23.576]  I truly believe everything you just said, 100%.
[02:15:23.576 --> 02:15:26.638]  One last thing, and I'll let you go.
[02:15:26.638 --> 02:15:31.963]  I have to go myself, but do you still listen to or follow Howard Stern in any kind of way?
[02:15:31.963 --> 02:15:34.905]  I mean, I don't really listen or follow.
[02:15:34.905 --> 02:15:37.588]  I don't really like a lot of the stuff he does, but I've been on his show before.
[02:15:37.588 --> 02:15:37.748]  Why?
[02:15:38.700 --> 02:15:39.861]  Well, I don't either.
[02:15:39.861 --> 02:15:40.481]  I don't either.
[02:15:40.481 --> 02:15:47.527]  But this morning, he actually had a, uh... He was talking about the election in Alabama.
[02:15:47.527 --> 02:15:51.810]  And he was talking about how the Roy Moore support... I gotta hear this.
[02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:52.791]  You gotta hold for the break.
[02:15:52.791 --> 02:15:53.252]  I gotta hear this.
[02:15:53.872 --> 02:15:56.455]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?

[02:19:50.762 --> 02:19:56.445]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:19:56.445 --> 02:19:59.107]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.250 --> 02:20:23.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:34.196 --> 02:20:41.420]  Alright, Chad in West Virginia, finishing up, he was asking, I heard Howard Stern.
[02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:47.043]  You know, I've been on Howard Stern's show, had a big response, it's a big show, been on his network quite a bit as a guest.
[02:20:47.043 --> 02:20:53.226]  I just don't have time to listen to it, and I know it's a racy show, so I'm not attacking Stern, I'm not defending Stern.
[02:20:53.226 --> 02:20:56.088]  Sometimes when I'm driving across the country, you know, and he's not.
[02:20:57.441 --> 02:21:02.803]  Making fart noises, then he has some entertaining guests on and interesting interviews.
[02:21:02.803 --> 02:21:05.284]  I think he gets interesting stuff out of people.
[02:21:05.284 --> 02:21:14.588]  I just, I mean you asked if I liked Howard Stern, and in general, I don't like the fact that I've heard him say Trump didn't really intend to win.
[02:21:14.588 --> 02:21:16.869]  That's what the Democrats say, and it's a loaded bullet.
[02:21:16.869 --> 02:21:19.029]  It's a backhanded attack.
[02:21:19.029 --> 02:21:22.851]  But that said, I think he's a talented broadcaster, but what was he talking about today?
[02:21:28.846 --> 02:21:29.868]  You did have to get on the road.
[02:21:29.868 --> 02:21:30.530]  You left your house.
[02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:31.331]  You're now in the car.
[02:21:31.331 --> 02:21:32.633]  Go ahead.
[02:21:32.633 --> 02:21:33.836]  What was Trump saying?
[02:21:33.836 --> 02:21:38.184]  I mean, what was he saying about Roy Moore?
[02:21:38.184 --> 02:21:38.444]  Stern.
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:41.761]  I really want to hear this.
[02:21:41.761 --> 02:21:43.342]  Get him back on hold, guys.
[02:21:43.342 --> 02:21:44.122]  Talk to him.
[02:21:44.122 --> 02:21:46.004]  Get him ready to come back on with us.
[02:21:46.004 --> 02:21:47.024]  So I held everybody through.
[02:21:47.024 --> 02:21:50.286]  I want to hear what Stern talked about with Roy Moore today.
[02:21:50.286 --> 02:21:52.828]  Or I'll have somebody else call in and tell me.
[02:21:52.828 --> 02:21:57.390]  So just as soon as he realizes we're going to go back to him, we'll do that.
[02:21:57.390 --> 02:22:00.132]  So let's try one more time to go back to Tennessee.
[02:22:00.132 --> 02:22:03.074]  Can you hear me?
[02:22:03.074 --> 02:22:04.795]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:22:04.795 --> 02:22:06.016]  Hello, Alex.
[02:22:06.016 --> 02:22:06.296]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:06.296 --> 02:22:07.617]  Go ahead.
[02:22:07.617 --> 02:22:08.737]  Oh, I guess Chad hung up.
[02:22:08.737 --> 02:22:09.598]  I'm a different caller.
[02:22:10.256 --> 02:22:11.336]  Okay.
[02:22:11.336 --> 02:22:12.917]  I'm going to suspend calls at this point.
[02:22:12.917 --> 02:22:16.018]  I'm not mad, but I don't know what's going on with the phone system, okay?
[02:22:16.018 --> 02:22:19.719]  Alex, Alex, can I ask you something?
[02:22:19.719 --> 02:22:21.019]  I'm having trouble.
[02:22:21.019 --> 02:22:25.380]  I love your show, and I have trouble listening to it because your app doesn't work with iOS 11.
[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:28.161]  I hear you, brother.
[02:22:28.161 --> 02:22:31.862]  There's a lot of stuff that doesn't work around here.
[02:22:31.862 --> 02:22:35.823]  And your other app, I know you got the new InfoWars Live app, but it glitches constantly.
[02:22:36.610 --> 02:22:40.875]  The Alex Jones app worked great, but now it's not compatible, so I can't hear it.
[02:22:40.875 --> 02:22:46.241]  I'm out in these West Texas oil fields trying to get my news, and I just wanted to let you know personally that I'm having trouble.
[02:22:46.241 --> 02:22:46.741]  I know.
[02:22:46.741 --> 02:22:47.602]  You know what?
[02:22:47.602 --> 02:22:50.305]  I got that app made about eight years ago.
[02:22:50.305 --> 02:22:50.665]  I paid $650.
[02:22:53.226 --> 02:23:00.609]  And then when it stopped being available about six months ago, I said, hey, can you know, hire a company to just update it so it works?
[02:23:00.609 --> 02:23:04.530]  And all the king's horses and all the king's men might be able to get that going for you.
[02:23:04.530 --> 02:23:09.852]  Yeah, we're going to abort that other app because it's had problems and I'm going to work with some other folks to build some.
[02:23:10.892 --> 02:23:16.137]  But the problem is there's a lot of leftists involved in the tech companies and in production and all the rest of it.
[02:23:16.137 --> 02:23:17.659]  We've actually been sabotaged.
[02:23:17.659 --> 02:23:20.321]  We've confirmed it's been done on purpose.
[02:23:20.321 --> 02:23:24.024]  Apple will say, oh, we're going to accept your film for iTunes, then refuse it three, four times.
[02:23:24.024 --> 02:23:27.147]  You know, Google's banned us in a bunch of places.
[02:23:27.147 --> 02:23:29.369]  And it's gotten a lot worse since Trump got into office.
[02:23:29.369 --> 02:23:32.012]  There's just economic operations going on.
[02:23:32.012 --> 02:23:35.755]  So I'm probably going to launch a big open fair or something.
[02:23:36.796 --> 02:23:47.483]  Maybe a 24-hour broadcast where just tech people call in, we vet them, we listen to them, and then we pay them to build us basic things that I could get eight years ago I can't get today.
[02:23:47.483 --> 02:23:49.905]  So I'm glad we got to this caller.
[02:23:49.905 --> 02:23:51.686]  I don't know who we're talking to.
[02:23:51.686 --> 02:23:54.388]  So tell me your name, caller.
[02:23:54.388 --> 02:23:55.949]  I'm Thomas from West Texas.
[02:23:55.949 --> 02:24:04.214]  Because of you, Alex, I got politically involved, went through my community, became a delegate, I worked my way up, gave my story about working in the Middle East.
[02:24:05.012 --> 02:24:09.515]  And became a national delegate and helped get Trump elected because of your radio show.
[02:24:09.515 --> 02:24:10.275]  So thank you.
[02:24:10.275 --> 02:24:11.276]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:24:11.276 --> 02:24:13.758]  And we're going to try to be taking more phone calls in the future.
[02:24:13.758 --> 02:24:26.826]  It's something I've gotten away from, but it's something that kind of comes down to an art form, getting the callers on, going to them, having them be there when you go to them, having them have good phones, having them respond.
[02:24:26.826 --> 02:24:33.811]  But we're going to make calls a bigger part of the broadcast because it's calls like you and the last caller that make it all really worthwhile.
[02:24:34.929 --> 02:24:35.089]  Let's go
[02:24:57.130 --> 02:24:58.974]  We need to set up an email address or something.
[02:24:58.974 --> 02:25:04.485]  I've been meaning to go to the audience for this, because I go to companies, I pay them money, nothing happens.
[02:25:04.485 --> 02:25:05.888]  Big companies, small companies.
[02:25:08.246 --> 02:25:09.146]  It's just bizarre.
[02:25:09.146 --> 02:25:15.769]  And then later I learned with some of the folks that it's just a big joke and that, you know, they're attacking us on their Facebook page and talking crap about us, you know.
[02:25:15.769 --> 02:25:19.910]  So, you know, I mean, I've run into quite a bit of interesting stuff out there.
[02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:23.991]  Because believe me, the left aren't just folks that cuss at you in the streets.
[02:25:23.991 --> 02:25:27.493]  They're creeping around involved in businesses and companies all over the place.
[02:25:27.493 --> 02:25:30.974]  And they're a very sinister, deceptive group of people.
[02:25:32.591 --> 02:25:38.286]  Well, the only way currently that I can listen to you is by listening to your podcast, The Next Day and A Dollar Short.
[02:25:39.207 --> 02:25:40.187]  I know, brother.
[02:25:40.187 --> 02:25:40.788]  I know.
[02:25:40.788 --> 02:25:42.588]  There's a lot of stuff we need to do.
[02:25:42.588 --> 02:25:56.472]  I've even thought about shutting the show down for a while just to give us the time to get everything geared back up because, I mean, we're just about doing the show, but then it's kind of like not putting it out, though, you know, because it can't just happen in the building.
[02:25:56.472 --> 02:25:58.753]  It's got to happen out there.
[02:25:58.753 --> 02:26:08.616]  But, you know, that's why I still work on the weekend and it's why I still do videos from my house myself and other things like that is so that I can just attempt to get out to people.
[02:26:09.656 --> 02:26:10.976]  And I'm not whining about it.
[02:26:10.976 --> 02:26:16.377]  It's just very frustrating to deal with the debt threats and the attacks and the cutting our sponsors off and all that.
[02:26:16.377 --> 02:26:17.738]  I can handle that.
[02:26:17.738 --> 02:26:25.759]  It's just the... It's the trying to actually get ducks in a row to put a broadcast out.
[02:26:25.759 --> 02:26:29.300]  The crew running the show do a great job running the show.
[02:26:29.300 --> 02:26:31.000]  It's just on the tech end of that.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.401]  So we'll work on that.
[02:26:32.401 --> 02:26:33.241]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:34.315 --> 02:26:38.598]  And again, we're taking phone calls today, folks, so we're getting all sorts of stuff here on air.
[02:26:38.598 --> 02:26:41.059]  You think you're talking to one caller, you're talking to another caller.
[02:26:41.059 --> 02:26:43.381]  But you know, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[02:26:44.318 --> 02:26:52.304]  Because for six months, people stop me, man, I walk down the street, they go, hey, hey, your iPhone app doesn't work anymore.
[02:26:52.304 --> 02:26:54.926]  I've been listening to you on this for like eight years, Alex.
[02:26:54.926 --> 02:26:57.527]  Can you just update that?
[02:26:57.527 --> 02:27:01.650]  Hell, I had a guy in the street come up to me and say, you know, I do apps.
[02:27:01.650 --> 02:27:02.931]  Here's my number, get in touch with me.
[02:27:02.931 --> 02:27:03.992]  We need to get that fixed.
[02:27:07.196 --> 02:27:15.781]  You know, the biggest thing you can do on your phones is, you can just go to InfoWars.com, and it works on my phone, and it works on droids, and works on everything.
[02:27:15.781 --> 02:27:21.224]  You just go to the top, and it says listen, and it says watch, and there are those.
[02:27:21.224 --> 02:27:29.589]  And you know, I noticed about a month ago, it said, and it always said listen, and it was a listen button.
[02:27:29.589 --> 02:27:32.831]  But then I clicked on it, and it was a watch button.
[02:27:32.831 --> 02:27:34.551]  And if you don't have a good man with it, it doesn't even work.
[02:27:34.551 --> 02:27:35.212]  And I went, man!
[02:27:36.943 --> 02:27:43.349]  Do we know why a listen button changed to a watch button but still said listen?
[02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:44.751]  And nobody knew.
[02:27:44.751 --> 02:27:47.854]  So, I said, you know what we're going to do?
[02:27:47.854 --> 02:27:53.119]  We're going to put listen up there again and we're going to have it actually listen.
[02:27:53.119 --> 02:27:57.683]  And then we're going to put next to it one that says watch.
[02:27:57.683 --> 02:28:00.086]  And then people can click on that one and they can watch.
[02:28:00.973 --> 02:28:06.517]  So, I'm not sure, but there's a lot of ways for you to just click and listen.
[02:28:06.517 --> 02:28:24.552]  They're on the site, but we will get that iPhone updated for you, my friend, because believe me, but the biggest thing you can do is there's also live streams, but I understand a lot of folks don't want to watch a video stream on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, our own platform, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:28:24.552 --> 02:28:26.994]  They want to have audio, like radio.
[02:28:28.034 --> 02:28:45.843]  And I understand that, so we're gonna, I myself, am gonna set out the next few days to see what the main ways for folks to listen on radio are, and then I'm gonna start a new initiative around here, where I'm gonna find out about how we get that app that 3-4 million people downloaded working for you.
[02:28:45.843 --> 02:28:49.004]  Well, I got a bunch of clips I'm gonna get to in your phone calls coming up.
[02:28:49.004 --> 02:28:49.525]  Stay with us.
[02:28:49.525 --> 02:28:49.905]  More fun.

[02:31:54.033 --> 02:31:55.995]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:55.995 --> 02:31:57.316]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:57.316 --> 02:31:58.516]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:58.516 --> 02:32:03.820]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:17.351]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:17.351 --> 02:32:18.712]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:32:19.492 --> 02:32:21.133]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:32:21.133 --> 02:32:23.714]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:23.714 --> 02:32:25.015]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:25.015 --> 02:32:26.115]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:32:26.115 --> 02:32:27.456]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:27.456 --> 02:32:31.958]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:31.958 --> 02:32:35.119]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:35.239 --> 02:32:38.280]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:39.340]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:41.280]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:42.301]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:32:42.301 --> 02:32:44.981]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:44.981 --> 02:32:48.262]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:48.262 --> 02:32:50.502]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:50.502 --> 02:32:55.463]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:32:55.463 --> 02:32:58.064]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.005 --> 02:33:18.011]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:18.011 --> 02:33:20.153]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.153 --> 02:33:25.679]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:33:25.679 --> 02:33:28.022]  More of your phone calls coming up.
[02:33:33.934 --> 02:33:41.097]  I really should just sit here for three or four hours one day and just read headlines so people get an idea of just how crazy this stuff is.
[02:33:41.097 --> 02:33:49.021]  I'm sure the audience already knows, but I was reading this Paul Watson article today that was just quotes out of the Swedish newspaper.
[02:33:49.021 --> 02:33:53.623]  And this doesn't make sense if you make sense as a person.
[02:33:53.623 --> 02:34:00.326]  But if you're social engineers that want to literally break the population to put up with anything, this is a formula.
[02:34:03.444 --> 02:34:08.148]  And then I was thinking about another one of Trump's accomplishes.
[02:34:08.148 --> 02:34:12.812]  I was thinking about one of the other big things that he's accomplished.
[02:34:12.812 --> 02:34:18.257]  When I was reading this story, and Daria popped in my ear and brought up another point.
[02:34:18.257 --> 02:34:20.859]  One of the producers.
[02:34:20.859 --> 02:34:24.262]  Trump has reversed the Red River land grab.
[02:34:27.247 --> 02:34:35.191]  Where the Feds just announced control of both sides of the river and took hundreds and hundreds of ranches, some of them that have been there for 150 years.
[02:34:35.191 --> 02:34:35.351]  Well now...
[02:34:42.864 --> 02:34:48.726]  Trump is shrinking the Obama monuments, where they're not getting rid of the actual monuments.
[02:34:48.726 --> 02:34:57.069]  The feds had announced even more land around them was off limits, when in many of those western states, more than half the state is federal land.
[02:34:57.069 --> 02:35:02.471]  In fact, some states are 85% or more.
[02:35:02.471 --> 02:35:05.131]  What, Utah's 90?
[02:35:05.131 --> 02:35:06.152]  Nevada's close to 90?
[02:35:08.134 --> 02:35:09.995]  Most of those states are more than half federal.
[02:35:09.995 --> 02:35:24.579]  So when you hear, oh, Obama took 5,000, 10,000 square miles around a monument, that's just in general area declaring more land, and there's only a few little pieces in there that were actually private.
[02:35:24.579 --> 02:35:28.160]  You'll have some 50-year-old or 100-year-old ranch.
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:29.341]  I see it in the news all the time.
[02:35:29.341 --> 02:35:30.601]  You've seen it.
[02:35:30.601 --> 02:35:36.323]  And they'll just say, we've been letting you use that road to get to your ranch up there on the mountaintop for 100 years.
[02:35:36.323 --> 02:35:37.243]  Sorry, it's locked.
[02:35:38.985 --> 02:35:41.566]  And the ranchers go, we're allowed to use it, it's our land.
[02:35:41.566 --> 02:35:48.988]  People go, huh, some dumb ranchers think they own land in the middle of a national park.
[02:35:48.988 --> 02:35:56.010]  And the public's so ignorant in big cities, they don't even understand there's all these ranches and farms in the middle of nowhere.
[02:35:56.010 --> 02:36:01.392]  I mean, you go out west, you'll drive an hour, and it's just federal land.
[02:36:02.472 --> 02:36:26.532]  Sometimes two hours, and then thank God you run into some little area that's got a couple of shops and a gas station and there's always some old ranch that they still got cattle on, but the feds have squeezed it down from 50,000 acres to, you know, 1,000, and that's how they get the tax easement, but grandma's old and the kid's already moved away, so when she dies, no more gas station.
[02:36:31.189 --> 02:36:39.202]  The West has been depleted of people being able to do business out there.
[02:36:39.202 --> 02:36:44.070]  And you get up to the Mississippi River and you start going West, I mean...
[02:36:45.715 --> 02:36:53.498]  SWAT teams will just come on some farmer's land and just aim guns at them for no reason or just shoot some kid off the back of a bike.
[02:36:53.498 --> 02:36:55.559]  Again, I'm not against police themselves.
[02:36:55.559 --> 02:36:59.380]  I'm against the Federali brainwashed green police.
[02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:00.661]  They're now giving guns.
[02:37:00.661 --> 02:37:03.762]  They're the ones that are crazy.
[02:37:03.762 --> 02:37:06.023]  So yeah, Daria just mentioned that.
[02:37:06.023 --> 02:37:09.925]  Trump is reversing things that took the globalists decades every day.
[02:37:10.948 --> 02:37:22.011]  It's devastating, it's lightning fast, and every time it's done pragmatically of what's fair and what's good for everybody.
[02:37:22.011 --> 02:37:24.111]  I mean, Trump is a godsend.
[02:37:24.111 --> 02:37:30.233]  I don't even want to get up here and say he's great, he's great, he's great, he's great, but I'm not going to lie to you.
[02:37:30.233 --> 02:37:35.294]  And then I look at the sacks of garbage.
[02:37:35.294 --> 02:37:36.194]  Here's another example.
[02:37:36.194 --> 02:37:38.515]  I have a stack of news every day without even looking at it.
[02:37:44.844 --> 02:37:58.713]  Where there are illegal aliens in Europe and the United States and other places running around just killing people.
[02:37:58.713 --> 02:38:04.476]  And in leftist countries, when they kill people, they'll even let them go sometimes.
[02:38:04.476 --> 02:38:09.940]  And then, I remember learning like a year and a half ago, people think I know a lot, I don't know a lot.
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:11.161]  I learned about a year and a half ago
[02:38:13.294 --> 02:38:16.777]  I saw a headline in Breitbart that the U.N.
[02:38:16.777 --> 02:38:22.081]  controls the State Department and controls the refugee immigration to the U.S.
[02:38:22.081 --> 02:38:36.772]  I knew they controlled the third world and the entries to Europe and coming here, but I didn't know that they were actually running the State Department through the migrant compact and that they would vet people without vetting them and that it was the U.N.
[02:38:36.772 --> 02:38:38.654]  giving them passports.
[02:38:38.654 --> 02:38:40.215]  So I went and looked it up and learned all about it.
[02:38:41.377 --> 02:38:45.459]  That happened eight years ago under Obama, putting us under the UN.
[02:38:45.459 --> 02:38:48.800]  I mean, imagine, I read all day long and I didn't know that.
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:56.263]  And it had been going on for like six years, seven years by the time I learned about it.
[02:38:56.263 --> 02:38:57.964]  What else is going on?
[02:38:57.964 --> 02:39:04.767]  I'm sitting here probably 14 hours a day just trying to learn stuff and I didn't know that.
[02:39:04.767 --> 02:39:05.747]  That's what Trump just did.
[02:39:08.430 --> 02:39:10.831]  He just killed it last week.
[02:39:10.831 --> 02:39:15.234]  We're pulling out of it.
[02:39:15.234 --> 02:39:20.137]  And the UN's freaking out.
[02:39:20.137 --> 02:39:29.122]  How on earth is the UN running who we bring in and then our government just accepts it like they're the Border Patrol or their customs?
[02:39:30.814 --> 02:39:33.297]  That's how far gone our sovereignty was.
[02:39:33.297 --> 02:39:37.401]  We were already 90% into world government and Trump's killing it all.
[02:39:37.401 --> 02:39:40.063]  And it's like every day it's something new.
[02:39:40.063 --> 02:39:44.428]  I can't even keep track of it!
[02:39:44.428 --> 02:39:51.515]  I just learned about this a year and a half ago and Trump's in office and has killed it.
[02:39:51.515 --> 02:39:52.656]  And then look at these headlines.
[02:39:52.656 --> 02:39:54.078]  I was reading these articles this morning.
[02:39:55.970 --> 02:39:59.352]  And they made me so upset that then I get on air and I'm angry.
[02:39:59.352 --> 02:40:00.113]  And that's why.
[02:40:00.113 --> 02:40:02.214]  I mean, they're saying they're going to kill the president.
[02:40:02.214 --> 02:40:04.816]  They're saying they're going to go ahead with impeachment.
[02:40:04.816 --> 02:40:06.357]  They've got indictments ready.
[02:40:06.357 --> 02:40:07.318]  I mean, that upsets me.
[02:40:07.318 --> 02:40:11.141]  So I apologize if I get cranky on air and I'm a little cranky with the crew.
[02:40:11.141 --> 02:40:16.204]  And I've been really cranky the last week because this is so real, folks.
[02:40:16.204 --> 02:40:19.987]  And now that we're delivering and starting to win, it makes it even crazier
[02:40:21.667 --> 02:40:28.550]  To watch the economy come back and to see the enemy even matter that we're trying to fix things.
[02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:33.232]  It makes me beyond hating them.
[02:40:33.232 --> 02:40:43.096]  This Paul Watson article though on Infowars.com, everybody should read this because it's not the Swedes that are being raped that are the story.
[02:40:43.096 --> 02:40:45.537]  I'm sad for them, it's a big deal, it's terrible.
[02:40:45.537 --> 02:40:49.399]  The story is that the other Swedes won't help them.
[02:40:51.058 --> 02:40:53.920]  And that's the Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:56.142]  You just give up.
[02:40:56.142 --> 02:40:58.884]  And you just go with the flow.
[02:40:58.884 --> 02:40:59.385]  Sweden.
[02:40:59.385 --> 02:41:07.831]  Migrant who participated in a 20-man gang rape of a woman tells police it was fun.
[02:41:07.831 --> 02:41:10.253]  That's like the illegal alien in court this week in the U.S.
[02:41:10.253 --> 02:41:10.673]  raped women.
[02:41:10.673 --> 02:41:12.254]  He said he's proud of it and he'll do it again.
[02:41:12.254 --> 02:41:13.455]  He's been deported 20 times.
[02:41:13.455 --> 02:41:15.357]  20 plus times.
[02:41:15.357 --> 02:41:19.000]  A migrant, he's not an illegal alien or an invader, he's a migrant, use that word,
[02:41:20.182 --> 02:41:21.063]  The incident occurred last Sunday.
[02:41:34.702 --> 02:41:49.416]  In the Fakat area of the Swedish capital, 20 men were involved in a brutal gang rape which took place at a stairwell, but police were only able to unify and charge five of the culprits, all of whom were migrants from Somalia and Iraq.
[02:41:49.416 --> 02:41:50.678]  Not invaders, but migrants.
[02:41:52.011 --> 02:41:57.020]  They beat her head in the wall, had a knife, raped her, according to a 30-year-old woman.
[02:41:57.020 --> 02:42:00.486]  The migrants discussed, who would get to use me first?
[02:42:00.486 --> 02:42:02.630]  And because she was a woman, they told the cops they did it.
[02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:04.373]  See, because they're Muslim, they're very proud of it.
[02:42:05.725 --> 02:42:10.929]  Before pulling her up to the second floor, many stood waiting for their turn, she added.
[02:42:10.929 --> 02:42:16.914]  The migrants smashed the woman's head against the staircase, knocking her unconscious as well as threatening her with a knife.
[02:42:16.914 --> 02:42:21.057]  The migrants laughed and filmed the scene on their cell phones as the attack unfolded.
[02:42:21.057 --> 02:42:25.940]  During a police interview, one of the attackers said the entire ordeal was a fun joke to the men.
[02:42:26.861 --> 02:42:41.674]  The victim's situation was made worse by the fact that when she attempted to get help from locals in the apartment, they either ignored her or insulted her, and then when she went bleeding and covered with semen, it's right here, they said, you're a gross person, we're not going to help you.
[02:42:41.674 --> 02:42:43.576]  The Swedes did, see?
[02:42:43.576 --> 02:42:52.323]  Pure demonic, spoiled rotten selfishness, is they didn't even care, because they were liberals.
[02:42:52.323 --> 02:42:52.724]  So what?

[02:44:11.028 --> 02:44:14.030]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:44:14.030 --> 02:44:22.856]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:44:24.897 --> 02:44:44.494]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.

[02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:25.173]  I'm covering a lot of this really negative news so we know about the threat, so we understand what's happening.
[02:47:25.173 --> 02:47:29.555]  It's not to demoralize you, it's not to put you down, it's to expose it.
[02:47:29.555 --> 02:47:31.336]  Because they don't want this news out.
[02:47:31.336 --> 02:47:36.539]  Continuing, this is from the Swedish newspapers, it's up on Infowars.com.
[02:47:36.539 --> 02:47:41.022]  The victim situation was just beaten up and gang raped at knife point by 20 men.
[02:47:41.022 --> 02:47:42.603]  Can you imagine that?
[02:47:43.578 --> 02:47:50.745]  Was made worse by the fact that when she attempted to get help from the locals, they either ignored her or insulted her.
[02:47:50.745 --> 02:48:07.220]  And that's the thing, is a guy hitting on a woman, they act like it's rape, but then they cover up rape and sex abuse and child abuse and pedophilia and men being raped and women being raped in Hollywood, and they kind of just mix it all together like it's the same thing.
[02:48:09.213 --> 02:48:19.560]  One man who lived in the area for 15 years saw the rape happening, but did nothing because in his own words, he has learned not to see or hear much.
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:25.604]  The woman who was labeled disgusting by another person because she had semen in her hair as a result of the gang rape.
[02:48:26.561 --> 02:48:36.025]  According to attorney Elizabeth Massey Fritz, the incident is one of the worst rape incidents she's dealt with in 26 years of practice, saying the attackers inflicted torture-like trauma on her client.
[02:48:36.025 --> 02:48:45.149]  Folks, I have a bunch of video at the anti-racism, pro-Muslim rallies they have in Europe of just guys lined up raping women that show up, and the women are just bloody.
[02:48:45.149 --> 02:48:46.630]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:51.292]  And it's just exploding, but there's no coverage of it.
[02:48:51.292 --> 02:48:52.553]  Stanley, defense attorney,
[02:48:53.519 --> 02:49:01.922]  Romanticized illegal immigrant felon in blog post and called him so-called dangerous felon and said he was a wonderful person.
[02:49:01.922 --> 02:49:04.523]  No, he shot her dead.
[02:49:04.523 --> 02:49:06.163]  He was deported a whole, what, five times.
[02:49:06.163 --> 02:49:11.785]  I don't care if you're a white guy raping women, a Hispanic guy, I don't care where you're from.
[02:49:13.171 --> 02:49:17.913]  You've got criminals that use multiple identities to go back and forth in countries.
[02:49:17.913 --> 02:49:23.215]  There are a lot of serial killers come out of Latin America into Mexico get caught there killing people because they run across borders.
[02:49:23.215 --> 02:49:24.995]  This is dangerous.
[02:49:24.995 --> 02:49:27.776]  And the idea that we can't control it is crazy.
[02:49:27.776 --> 02:49:29.137]  Europe's migrant crisis.
[02:49:29.137 --> 02:49:30.818]  Millions still to come.
[02:49:30.818 --> 02:49:33.319]  Gladstone Institute up on Infowars.com.
[02:49:33.319 --> 02:49:33.959]  The UN says
[02:49:35.097 --> 02:49:38.780]  They want to bring in 50 million North Africans.
[02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:40.741]  You think 10 million is a crisis?
[02:49:40.741 --> 02:49:44.724]  Germany offers migrants 3,500 to leave voluntarily.
[02:49:44.724 --> 02:49:46.506]  So Merkel knows she's about to get thrown out.
[02:49:46.506 --> 02:49:48.627]  They're panicking.
[02:49:48.627 --> 02:49:54.211]  Meanwhile, 3,108 since October 1st.
[02:49:54.211 --> 02:49:59.976]  Refugee admissions dropped by 489% as Trump withdraws from UN migration compact.
[02:50:01.988 --> 02:50:05.049]  We're under UN control soon.
[02:50:05.049 --> 02:50:08.030]  And it takes like six months to get out, so we won't be out until next year.
[02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:11.812]  And again, I have stacks of these.
[02:50:11.812 --> 02:50:16.694]  Norway, Syrian migrant punches woman in the face 12 times after stealing cell phone.
[02:50:16.694 --> 02:50:22.956]  And there's photos and videos of it!
[02:50:22.956 --> 02:50:26.978]  Meanwhile, just because Trump wants to slow all this down, he's a horrible bigot and a racist.
[02:50:26.978 --> 02:50:30.299]  We have a big New York Times article up.
[02:50:31.237 --> 02:50:37.460]  We have a story about the New York Times where three times in the last day they've said Trump's this horrible racist without even having any proof.
[02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:40.661]  They just say he's a Nazi.
[02:50:40.661 --> 02:50:45.803]  Meanwhile, we show articles where they say, can white people be good or are they just inherently evil?
[02:50:45.803 --> 02:50:52.246]  We show the New York Times with headlines a few weeks ago saying, are whites just inherently bad?
[02:50:52.246 --> 02:50:59.749]  That's one step up from the article we covered last week at Texas State University saying, white DNA is an abomination.
[02:51:01.940 --> 02:51:10.185]  That's literal race cult, beyond the Nazis, cuckoo stuff.
[02:51:10.185 --> 02:51:16.329]  It's like, that's a white dog, itch to the devil, black dog's good, or a black dog's bad, and a white dog's good.
[02:51:16.329 --> 02:51:29.038]  Let me tell you something, you can have a Labrador retriever that's got white skin or black skin, and I've had a white one, I've had a cream one, not really white, and I've had a chocolate lab and a black lab in my life, and they all acted just the same.
[02:51:29.565 --> 02:51:37.278]  They were all funny, and goofy, and smart, and had energy, and they all got hip dysplasia and died when they were 12.
[02:51:37.278 --> 02:51:39.261]  Didn't care, didn't matter what color the melanin was.
[02:51:40.589 --> 02:51:47.935]  Because the chocolate one had chocolate skin, and the black one had black skin, and the white one had pink skin, and they were all just goofy sweethearts.
[02:51:47.935 --> 02:51:52.098]  And it's the same, imagine saying, white labs are inherently evil.
[02:51:52.098 --> 02:51:58.563]  I mean, it's just, it's like, and it's like the most racist crap I've ever heard!
[02:51:58.563 --> 02:52:01.446]  And they're just spewing, and I know it's meant to make me racist.
[02:52:01.446 --> 02:52:05.249]  I know they want to just divide everybody now, they want to get away from the Christian ethos.
[02:52:08.889 --> 02:52:10.669]  They found an article where they're saying dogs are racist.
[02:52:10.669 --> 02:52:18.391]  Well, it's true that if a dog is being raised by a black family and isn't around a lot of white folks, it might bark at you because it's not used to your color.
[02:52:18.391 --> 02:52:19.511]  It's true.
[02:52:19.511 --> 02:52:24.172]  But it's not a racist thing, it's that it doesn't recognize you.
[02:52:24.172 --> 02:52:30.754]  So, anyways, the point is, is that this is getting crazy.
[02:52:30.754 --> 02:52:31.914]  And I've got a bunch of other stories.
[02:52:31.914 --> 02:52:34.335]  I mean, here's the problem.
[02:52:34.335 --> 02:52:35.375]  I've got total overload.
[02:52:36.428 --> 02:52:40.372]  I mean, I've got like 30 clips here that are all incredibly important.
[02:52:40.372 --> 02:52:43.996]  Dershowitz Flynn plea is now a show of weakness for Mueller.
[02:52:43.996 --> 02:52:44.897]  I totally agree.
[02:52:44.897 --> 02:52:57.150]  All he's got after going after Manafort with no Russia connections and there's no Russia indictment there, now it's, oh, there's no Russia collusion, but you
[02:52:59.389 --> 02:53:05.051]  In an illegal transcript recorded of you, didn't tell the FBI exactly the way the call went.
[02:53:05.051 --> 02:53:10.393]  I mean, if they asked me six months ago, you talked to this person and said this, I'd be like, huh?
[02:53:10.393 --> 02:53:15.495]  But again, the phone call is okay.
[02:53:15.495 --> 02:53:16.676]  We put sanctions on you.
[02:53:16.676 --> 02:53:24.779]  We hope you don't put sanctions on us and we want to keep working with you to take out ISIS.
[02:53:24.779 --> 02:53:25.579]  So that's all they got.
[02:53:27.807 --> 02:53:28.367]  But here it is.
[02:53:28.367 --> 02:53:29.688]  Let's go to that clip, Dershowitz.
[02:53:29.688 --> 02:53:32.969]  Flynn plea is a show of weakness for Mueller.
[02:53:32.969 --> 02:53:33.609]  I totally agree.
[02:53:33.609 --> 02:53:33.910]  Here it is.
[02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:41.353]  The last thing any prosecutor wants to do is to have to indict his primary witness for lying.
[02:53:41.353 --> 02:53:46.755]  Because if you indict your witness for lying, it really means he's not useful as a witness.
[02:53:46.755 --> 02:53:48.356]  He has no credibility.
[02:53:48.356 --> 02:53:54.918]  I'm sure the prosecutor was trying... Yeah, what that says is false informant.
[02:53:54.918 --> 02:53:56.199]  What that says is, is a fraud.
[02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:09.809]  But talking to the Flynn family, they got cut off from Trump and he's agreed to talk about what he did because Flynn believes nothing wrong's happened and he's not trying to burn Trump.
[02:54:09.809 --> 02:54:16.934]  He's just been indicted because they were surveilling him and claimed he didn't tell the whole story.
[02:54:16.934 --> 02:54:24.279]  So again, Flynn is a total victim in this and Trump, I know, agrees that he was wrong to ever get rid of Flynn.
[02:54:25.854 --> 02:54:29.635]  It's like his lawyer, everybody knows it's not Trump tweeting all the time.
[02:54:29.635 --> 02:54:34.716]  His lawyer came out and he got chewed out for coming out and tweeting on Trump's behalf.
[02:54:34.716 --> 02:54:45.998]  Trump got rid of Flynn when the Vice President came in and said, he didn't tell me about all these conversations when I asked him.
[02:54:45.998 --> 02:54:48.479]  And that's what happened.
[02:54:48.479 --> 02:54:50.459]  Also Mattis wanted him out of there.
[02:54:50.459 --> 02:54:53.560]  It was really the other generals didn't want to come in if Flynn was there.
[02:54:55.876 --> 02:54:58.018]  Okay.
[02:54:58.018 --> 02:55:01.801]  Let's go ahead and go to another clip here.
[02:55:01.801 --> 02:55:05.744]  This is important on tax reform, so I wanted to get through this one.
[02:55:05.744 --> 02:55:09.467]  Tim Scott shoots down Democrat criticism of tax reform.
[02:55:09.467 --> 02:55:11.888]  You know, they're spinning this.
[02:55:11.888 --> 02:55:17.173]  Even on Fox, they go, Democrats think tax cuts are bad for the Republicans.
[02:55:17.173 --> 02:55:19.675]  Republicans think they're good.
[02:55:19.675 --> 02:55:23.898]  You can debate taxes, you can debate deficits, you can debate
[02:55:25.031 --> 02:55:40.682]  The future, but tax cuts now to bring back $4 trillion in overseas money and to bring back trillions to middle class and poor taxpayers is going to cause a giant boom in the economy, bigger than we've already seen.
[02:55:40.682 --> 02:55:46.246]  Most analysts say a 10% growth rate, 7 to 10%, but 10 is the middle.
[02:55:46.246 --> 02:55:49.709]  Some estimates are 12% because they've had to suppress so long.
[02:55:49.709 --> 02:55:51.330]  Now, is that going to be good?
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:59.083]  Just in a Machiavellian way, for the Republicans and for Trump.
[02:55:59.083 --> 02:56:03.025]  Yeah, it's gonna be good to have four to six years of boom.
[02:56:03.025 --> 02:56:07.147]  Now, if we don't cut, or at least freeze spending.
[02:56:09.443 --> 02:56:11.806]  It'll create a big deficit like what happened with Reagan.
[02:56:11.806 --> 02:56:14.328]  They got the tax cuts, they never got the cuts.
[02:56:14.328 --> 02:56:15.850]  You gotta freeze the spending.
[02:56:15.850 --> 02:56:16.951]  Then you cut taxes.
[02:56:16.951 --> 02:56:20.775]  More money comes in, generally, because it spurs the economy.
[02:56:20.775 --> 02:56:22.537]  Then you pay down the debt with that.
[02:56:22.537 --> 02:56:23.739]  That's what's gotta happen.
[02:56:23.739 --> 02:56:25.360]  Bare minimum, freeze the spending.
[02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:27.763]  But, will tax cuts help the country?
[02:56:27.763 --> 02:56:29.405]  Does a bear go poo-poo in the woods?
[02:56:29.405 --> 02:56:30.066]  Here's part of the clip.
[02:56:31.095 --> 02:56:33.477]  I'm old enough to remember the 86 tax cut bill.
[02:56:33.477 --> 02:56:35.699]  It took 15 months.
[02:56:35.699 --> 02:56:42.465]  I'm just wondering, I mean, just as a simple yes or no, I mean, was this the process that you had hoped for, to have all these changes made at the last minute?
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:45.901]  Well, Jake, I'll say it this way.
[02:56:45.901 --> 02:56:49.244]  The last hearing that we had was a 23 hour hearing.
[02:56:49.244 --> 02:56:53.127]  We had 63 Democrat amendments that were offered.
[02:56:53.127 --> 02:57:04.135]  The suggestion that this was not done in the light of day, and the last minute changes as they talk about them, were last minute changes that had been envisioned for weeks.
[02:57:04.135 --> 02:57:08.899]  We knew at the end that there would be dials that were changed.
[02:57:08.899 --> 02:57:10.160]  So, here's an example.
[02:57:10.640 --> 02:57:13.882]  We increased helping small businesses by about 2.4%.
[02:57:13.882 --> 02:57:18.103]  That happened in the last hour or so.
[02:57:18.103 --> 02:57:21.965]  But that had been envisioned for the last 10 days because we had been talking about that.
[02:57:21.965 --> 02:57:22.145]  Exactly.
[02:57:22.145 --> 02:57:23.406]  Everybody knows what's been in the mix.
[02:57:23.406 --> 02:57:25.287]  I'm going to come back and play the rest of it.
[02:57:25.287 --> 02:57:26.867]  Oh, by the way, guess what else is in there?
[02:57:26.867 --> 02:57:29.228]  Obamacare repeal.
[02:57:29.228 --> 02:57:31.369]  They said you could never repeal Obamacare.
[02:57:31.369 --> 02:57:33.030]  They said you could never get tax cuts.
[02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:34.831]  You could never get a 3% growth rate.
[02:57:36.545 --> 02:57:37.786]  You guys are losers.
[02:57:37.786 --> 02:57:41.509]  You're failing, we're winning, and we're winning making you rich!
[02:57:41.509 --> 02:57:46.934]  Get out of the way!
[02:57:46.934 --> 02:57:52.119]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:57:52.119 --> 02:57:53.120]  Optimum levels.
[02:57:54.178 --> 02:57:58.821]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:57:58.821 --> 02:58:01.142]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:58:01.142 --> 02:58:02.943]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:58:02.943 --> 02:58:08.206]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[02:58:08.206 --> 02:58:10.507]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[02:58:10.507 --> 02:58:16.190]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[02:58:16.190 --> 02:58:16.570]  Secret 12.
[02:58:16.570 --> 02:58:17.271]  O-O-O-Optimum.
[02:58:17.611 --> 02:58:18.132]  We're good.
[02:58:44.804 --> 02:58:49.750]  Emerix Essential Oils can help balance your sleep schedule and realign your sleep cycle.

[02:59:46.808 --> 02:59:49.531]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.813 --> 03:00:05.837]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.837 --> 03:00:07.939]  Love me some Merle Haggard.
[03:00:07.939 --> 03:00:17.245]  The boys tell how Fonjo fell, and left his living in a cheap hotel.
[03:00:17.245 --> 03:00:23.910]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold, so the story ends we're told.
[03:00:27.347 --> 03:00:28.007]  That's the thing.
[03:00:28.007 --> 03:00:30.988]  Poncho went out in a big blaze of glory.
[03:00:30.988 --> 03:00:32.629]  And lived forever.
[03:00:32.629 --> 03:00:35.650]  Lefty died an old sick man.
[03:00:35.650 --> 03:00:39.131]  And not the stuff of legends.
[03:00:39.131 --> 03:00:44.893]  And now... That's another lesson from life.
[03:00:44.893 --> 03:00:45.673]  And a true story.
[03:00:47.972 --> 03:00:54.176]  Matt Dubiel from our great Chicago affiliate, 1530 WCKG is coming up.
[03:00:54.176 --> 03:00:58.779]  I want to take a few more of your calls here as I promised to do.
[03:00:58.779 --> 03:01:06.424]  It's hard to focus on a lot of this, but you as an audience that care about this and have been involved, you're the reason we're starting to turn the tide.
[03:01:06.424 --> 03:01:07.725]  I'm not just patting you on the head.
[03:01:07.725 --> 03:01:08.826]  It's not patronizing.
[03:01:08.826 --> 03:01:10.387]  It's true.
[03:01:10.387 --> 03:01:12.728]  So just know that.
[03:01:12.728 --> 03:01:16.691]  And the fact that it is always darkest before the dawn.
[03:01:18.319 --> 03:01:30.322]  But then once the worm turns, once the bullies aren't pulling on top of us, and people see what prosperity can be like, a whole new cycle begins of prosperity.
[03:01:30.322 --> 03:01:39.663]  And if we just remember freedom and don't let the same corruption come back in like mole spores or something, we've got a pretty good future ahead of us.
[03:01:39.663 --> 03:01:42.044]  Doesn't mean some utopia.
[03:01:42.044 --> 03:01:43.384]  But what is utopia?
[03:01:43.384 --> 03:01:45.145]  It's not living in a dystopia.
[03:01:47.725 --> 03:01:51.888]  Imperfection is our perfection.
[03:01:51.888 --> 03:01:59.894]  But the globalists really did want to just wreck the West and make everybody globally poor and do some really nasty stuff.
[03:01:59.894 --> 03:02:04.518]  And the fact is, they know tax cuts for the middle class helps the economy and pays off the debt.
[03:02:04.518 --> 03:02:08.401]  The globalists want to deliver us into bankruptcy.
[03:02:08.401 --> 03:02:09.582]  They want to conquer the nation.
[03:02:10.421 --> 03:02:17.309]  But Trump, and patriots in our intelligence agencies, and good factions, and the American people backing him.
[03:02:17.309 --> 03:02:18.831]  People ask, why did we do this earlier?
[03:02:18.831 --> 03:02:20.333]  Because folks weren't awake yet!
[03:02:20.333 --> 03:02:21.374]  They'd been asleep!
[03:02:21.374 --> 03:02:27.041]  You educated them, I educated them, countless other people educated them.
[03:02:27.041 --> 03:02:30.405]  And people are aware now that we're not alone and we've changed the world?
[03:02:33.171 --> 03:02:35.552]  And now we're not asleep anymore to a great extent.
[03:02:35.552 --> 03:02:41.976]  So now it's even harder for the globalists, even if they kill Trump, even if they remove Trump, even if they pull all this crap.
[03:02:41.976 --> 03:02:49.161]  They're behind the eight ball now because we're awake.
[03:02:49.161 --> 03:02:51.762]  Steven in Florida, you had a point about all this.
[03:02:51.762 --> 03:02:55.004]  You say Trump latest evidence, go ahead.
[03:02:55.004 --> 03:02:57.306]  Yeah, hey Alex, thank you, I appreciate it.
[03:02:57.306 --> 03:03:01.228]  By the way, first of all, I want to say I've been calling your show about 10 years now or so.
[03:03:01.857 --> 03:03:12.292]  I had a first today and this isn't a complaint, it's just to make you aware that you've had enough complaints today, but I know when I've gotten through because then I hear your show on my phone.
[03:03:12.292 --> 03:03:16.017]  It took about 22 minutes for the call screener to finally get to me.
[03:03:16.761 --> 03:03:19.281]  So I just wanted to, you know, make you aware of that.
[03:03:19.281 --> 03:03:24.722]  That's because this phone system can take like 30 phone calls at a time.
[03:03:24.722 --> 03:03:29.863]  And we've taken up to 25,000 calls in a show before that shows that hit it.
[03:03:29.863 --> 03:03:32.664]  So they're having to like go through all that.
[03:03:32.664 --> 03:03:37.705]  And, and, you know, I, I get when I take calls, it's fun to complain, but it kind of wrecks the experience.
[03:03:37.705 --> 03:03:38.165]  You know what I mean?
[03:03:38.165 --> 03:03:41.245]  Because we're having like a personal experience.
[03:03:41.245 --> 03:03:42.806]  You and I right now.
[03:03:42.806 --> 03:03:44.386]  And we never even get to the point.
[03:03:45.205 --> 03:03:49.629]  But hey, what's the latest evidence that Trump's a risky agent?
[03:03:49.629 --> 03:03:51.010]  Okay.
[03:03:51.010 --> 03:03:52.291]  Here's what I wanted to get to.
[03:03:52.291 --> 03:04:02.859]  If these people are able to push through what they're now pushing with this false evidence, you know, narrative, it'll be for one reason only.
[03:04:02.859 --> 03:04:04.961]  And that is because God has allowed it.
[03:04:04.961 --> 03:04:10.445]  Because my Bible says that the most high rule is in the kingdom of men and give it to whomsoever he will.
[03:04:10.445 --> 03:04:13.788]  I have no doubt Trump is there by the appointment of God.
[03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:15.980]  And here's what I want to get to.
[03:04:15.980 --> 03:04:27.584]  If they push this through, if they're able to still push their agenda with all the false information and all the evidence coming about their criminality, it's because God has allowed it.
[03:04:27.584 --> 03:04:28.804]  Here's why.
[03:04:28.804 --> 03:04:35.866]  The main problem I see with America, and I say this as a Christian, Alex, I've run into this so much, is the sin in the camp.
[03:04:35.866 --> 03:04:38.147]  It's the fake Christianity.
[03:04:38.147 --> 03:04:42.288]  The Christians in America don't want to wake up to the reality of what's going on.
[03:04:42.839 --> 03:04:48.533]  And I'm not talking about just the establishment churches and the... I'm talking about in general.
[03:04:48.533 --> 03:04:49.777]  No, I hear you, I hear you.
[03:04:49.777 --> 03:04:50.879]  I'm glad your call got through.
[03:04:50.879 --> 03:04:51.300]  We'll be back.

[03:06:00.203 --> 03:06:07.225]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.225 --> 03:06:16.407]  And Matt Dubio with 1530 WCKG, our big Chicago affiliate on 1530, but also on the FM, and soon big announcements with that station.
[03:06:16.407 --> 03:06:18.588]  He is about to take over right now.
[03:06:21.658 --> 03:06:24.780]  But I wanted to just briefly recap here.
[03:06:24.780 --> 03:06:25.740]  Here's the headlines.
[03:06:25.740 --> 03:06:28.502]  They're up on Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:06:28.502 --> 03:06:29.483]  This is NBC News.
[03:06:29.483 --> 03:06:30.583]  Feinstein.
[03:06:30.583 --> 03:06:34.406]  Senate Russia probe building obstruction case against Trump.
[03:06:34.406 --> 03:06:38.748]  Is President Trump's legal team preparing for an imminent obstruction of justice charge?
[03:06:38.748 --> 03:06:41.950]  And the answer is yes.
[03:06:41.950 --> 03:06:45.692]  But that's why presidents are co-equal to the other branches.
[03:06:45.692 --> 03:06:46.753]  You just can't have some
[03:06:48.115 --> 03:06:55.441]  Grand jury indict the president and he gets out of office because then you'd have grand juries all the time doing that.
[03:06:55.441 --> 03:06:58.983]  No president would stay in power.
[03:06:58.983 --> 03:06:59.984]  This is their program.
[03:06:59.984 --> 03:07:00.885]  This is their plan.
[03:07:00.885 --> 03:07:02.206]  This is their operation.
[03:07:02.206 --> 03:07:06.809]  They're going to have to impeach him in the House and the Senate.
[03:07:06.809 --> 03:07:11.693]  And the good news is finally we learn that the last 11 months
[03:07:13.066 --> 03:07:27.796]  The Inspector General of the Justice Department, under Attorney General Jeff Sessions' direction, has been criminally investigating Mueller, the Clintons, and this entire kangaroo operation.
[03:07:27.796 --> 03:07:32.679]  The DOJ has been investigating the FBI for 11 months.
[03:07:32.679 --> 03:07:34.540]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:07:34.540 --> 03:07:38.503]  House Intel Chairman draws up contempt charges against FBI after Stonewall.
[03:07:40.029 --> 03:07:46.450]  Republicans prepare for war with FBI, DOJ to file contempt action over anti-Trump bias.
[03:07:46.450 --> 03:07:54.652]  That was forced out in the media because the Justice Department was getting ready to release reports on this, which they did release today.
[03:07:54.652 --> 03:07:59.193]  We wrote about it, but it's almost got no coverage.
[03:07:59.193 --> 03:08:06.614]  So my question to Matt Dubiel as he takes over here is this.
[03:08:06.614 --> 03:08:06.814]  Matt,
[03:08:09.915 --> 03:08:15.898]  We know, as long as there's a recovery, they're not going to be able to get an impeachment in the House, as long as we keep the House.
[03:08:15.898 --> 03:08:16.838]  But they don't care.
[03:08:16.838 --> 03:08:20.780]  They just seem to be going forward, even though they're all deep in bed with Russia.
[03:08:20.780 --> 03:08:26.783]  At a gut level, as a smart guy, as a business owner, as a family man, what do you think they're planning?
[03:08:26.783 --> 03:08:28.323]  I mean, they thought they were going to steal the election.
[03:08:28.323 --> 03:08:29.064]  They failed.
[03:08:29.064 --> 03:08:30.925]  But they just don't know when to give up.
[03:08:30.925 --> 03:08:34.987]  How do they remove Trump when he's clearly Americana, the economy's kicking back on,
[03:08:36.280 --> 03:08:38.201]  He's doing everything he said he'd do.
[03:08:38.201 --> 03:08:40.021]  He has no Russian connections.
[03:08:40.021 --> 03:08:41.522]  They admit Manafort or Flynn.
[03:08:41.522 --> 03:08:42.982]  There's no Russian collusion.
[03:08:42.982 --> 03:08:48.084]  They're just claiming they said something wrong in a statement when they're being illegally surveilled.
[03:08:48.084 --> 03:08:50.725]  Where do you see all this going?
[03:08:50.725 --> 03:08:54.306]  The NFL's killing itself, attacking the American people.
[03:08:54.306 --> 03:08:56.066]  Hollywood's killing itself.
[03:08:56.066 --> 03:08:59.988]  It's all falling down, but they never know when to quit.
[03:08:59.988 --> 03:09:02.449]  Matt Dubio, taking over from 1530 AM in Chicago.
[03:09:04.466 --> 03:09:10.932]  Alex, you know, they don't know when to quit, but that's why the power of the American people is so important.
[03:09:10.932 --> 03:09:22.202]  That's why it's so vital that instead of being the idiots who look at the Emperor's new clothes and say, yeah, he's got a new suit on, like we did for the last eight years when he was naked.
[03:09:22.842 --> 03:09:41.277]  Now it's reversed, and now the zombies, the Feinsteins, and the swamp inhabitants are looking up at the President, who's got some clothes, he's got some schwagger, he's got some actual things that he's putting into place, and they're looking at him and they're going, he doesn't have it.
[03:09:41.277 --> 03:09:45.761]  And if the people are stupid enough to watch what those people say,
[03:09:46.081 --> 03:09:47.882]  I mean, we've got to just stop listening to idiots.
[03:09:47.882 --> 03:09:49.063]  That's the bottom line.
[03:09:49.063 --> 03:09:50.724]  You've got to take a look at Maxine Waters.
[03:09:50.724 --> 03:09:53.586]  You've got to take a look at these people that have been in the swamp.
[03:09:53.586 --> 03:09:54.486]  They're up to here.
[03:09:54.486 --> 03:09:55.267]  They're covered in swamp water.
[03:09:55.267 --> 03:09:55.567]  That's it.
[03:09:55.567 --> 03:09:58.689]  They're totally discredited, known liars.
[03:09:58.689 --> 03:10:00.690]  So, of course, they're doubling down on lies.
[03:10:00.690 --> 03:10:01.791]  That's all they've got.
[03:10:01.791 --> 03:10:04.833]  This is the last desperate action of these scallywags.
[03:10:05.805 --> 03:10:11.448]  It's, well, and we're parents, you know how this goes, when you're, you know, you ask your kid, did you go in the cookie jar, and they say no.
[03:10:11.448 --> 03:10:13.329]  They're never going to admit it the first time.
[03:10:13.329 --> 03:10:20.093]  You keep asking them, you watch them look away from you, you watch them obfuscate, you watch them like point the finger at the brother or the sister.
[03:10:20.093 --> 03:10:28.437]  That's what Maxine and all these other morons are doing, and it's time for the American people to stand up and say, you know what, we're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore.
[03:10:28.717 --> 03:10:29.697]  We're not going to get angry.
[03:10:29.697 --> 03:10:30.697]  We're not going to get stupid.
[03:10:30.697 --> 03:10:32.478]  We're not going to say stupid things.
[03:10:32.478 --> 03:10:34.018]  But we are going to act.
[03:10:34.018 --> 03:10:35.658]  We're going to act with our dollars.
[03:10:35.658 --> 03:10:37.219]  We're going to act with our votes.
[03:10:37.219 --> 03:10:39.139]  We're going to pay attention to what's happening.
[03:10:39.139 --> 03:10:41.680]  We're going to make a list and we're going to check it twice.
[03:10:41.680 --> 03:10:45.000]  And we're going to make sure that Maxine Waters doesn't get back in.
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:58.163]  We're going to make sure that Quigley, the congressman here in Illinois, that instead of focusing on the death toll problem, Alex, there are 39 people that were killed here in Chicago, 36 of them from gunshots, mostly illegal guns.
[03:10:58.923 --> 03:11:03.046]  And those people are the ones that Quigley should be focusing on.
[03:11:03.046 --> 03:11:09.089]  Instead, he's talking to subcommittees in Congress about- By the way, 39 killed since when?
[03:11:09.089 --> 03:11:10.690]  39 was killed just in November.
[03:11:10.690 --> 03:11:11.010]  Wow.
[03:11:11.010 --> 03:11:12.311]  Just in November.
[03:11:12.311 --> 03:11:14.493]  Alex, it's- By the way, I'm glad you raised Quigley.
[03:11:14.493 --> 03:11:19.836]  I don't mean to- I don't know if you saw the hearings where he says, I want Alex Jones censored.
[03:11:19.836 --> 03:11:22.938]  And Facebook, Google, and Twitter go, sir, we censored him at lunch.
[03:11:23.558 --> 03:11:28.101]  He goes, good, it's fake news that an ISIS guy attacked New York with a truck.
[03:11:28.101 --> 03:11:29.722]  And it's like a real story.
[03:11:29.722 --> 03:11:30.803]  It's not even real.
[03:11:30.803 --> 03:11:35.365]  He's like saying, I say ISIS didn't attack New York and that the mayor wasn't warned.
[03:11:35.365 --> 03:11:37.627]  And they go, yes sir, we shut Alex Jones down.
[03:11:37.627 --> 03:11:38.768]  We shut Paul Watson down.
[03:11:38.768 --> 03:11:40.789]  I mean, what is up with Piggly Wiggly?
[03:11:41.769 --> 03:11:47.494]  Wiggly Wiggly's gotta go, and it's up to the people in Chicago, in the suburbs, you know, his territory.
[03:11:47.494 --> 03:11:56.101]  They've re-zoned these territories in Chicagoland over and over again, and they keep gerrymandering because they're trying to keep the Democratic machine here in power.
[03:11:56.101 --> 03:12:00.505]  Now, that's not to say that the Republican machine is any great machine either.
[03:12:00.505 --> 03:12:04.588]  I was just talking to my kids yesterday about this fallacy of the two-party system.
[03:12:04.588 --> 03:12:09.973]  However, you gotta play by the rules of the game that are in place, and in Chicago, in Chicagoland,
[03:12:10.433 --> 03:12:11.654]  He's playing by those rules.
[03:12:11.654 --> 03:12:13.015]  He's part of the Democratic machine.
[03:12:13.015 --> 03:12:14.295]  The guy's an idiot.
[03:12:14.295 --> 03:12:25.662]  Instead of fixing the problem, instead of talking to the mayor of Chicago and the governor of Illinois and trying to figure out why black and brown kids are getting shot for no reason, he's talking to people about what Twitter should be doing.
[03:12:25.742 --> 03:12:27.402]  The guy's a complete moron.
[03:12:27.402 --> 03:12:29.563]  Why is he talking about what Twitter should be doing?
[03:12:29.563 --> 03:12:31.263]  Why is he talking about censoring the news?
[03:12:31.263 --> 03:12:39.385]  Why is he talking about saying that you're making false claims, saying that Infowars is fake news, when ABC is fake news?
[03:12:39.385 --> 03:12:41.906]  When CNN is fake news?
[03:12:41.906 --> 03:12:48.607]  Yeah, what do you make of ABC putting out that Flynn was going to report that they did collude with the Russians during the campaign?
[03:12:48.607 --> 03:12:49.847]  None of it was true!
[03:12:49.847 --> 03:12:52.768]  But still, I see them sending videos out of that today!
[03:12:54.161 --> 03:13:00.385]  I don't know anybody who can listen to what ABC says, what CNN says.
[03:13:00.385 --> 03:13:10.973]  I mean, you played the Jake Tapper clip a few minutes ago in the last segment of the previous hour, and I'm just watching and thinking, who listens to this turd Tapper to get their information about the world?
[03:13:10.973 --> 03:13:12.814]  When I look to people that I listen to,
[03:13:13.895 --> 03:13:15.576]  I asked myself, who am I going to listen to?
[03:13:15.576 --> 03:13:17.357]  Who am I going to take their advice?
[03:13:17.357 --> 03:13:18.919]  Who am I going to trust?
[03:13:18.919 --> 03:13:29.006]  And the people that I will listen to, I'm still going to fact check, but I want to listen to people that I believe truly care and truly love themselves and love me and love this country.
[03:13:29.006 --> 03:13:30.968]  I don't get that vibe when I look at Jake Tapper.
[03:13:30.968 --> 03:13:33.530]  I don't get that vibe when I look at that moron on ABC.
[03:13:33.530 --> 03:13:33.990]  What's his name?
[03:13:33.990 --> 03:13:35.432]  Hoss or Boss or Ross?
[03:13:35.432 --> 03:13:35.912]  Yeah, Ross.
[03:13:36.072 --> 03:13:41.193]  All they've got is arrogance, too, and as they implode, they just get more arrogant.
[03:13:41.193 --> 03:13:42.553]  I mean, they just never go away.
[03:13:42.553 --> 03:13:44.274]  I'm so sick of these people.
[03:13:44.274 --> 03:13:45.634]  Well, they're better than us.
[03:13:45.634 --> 03:13:59.337]  And that's the other fallacy, is these people somehow think, these Americans, these that have been sleeping for so long, the reason why these people are in power, the reason why Maxine is where she is, the reason why Ross is on television is because we've been asleep at the wheel.
[03:13:59.337 --> 03:14:02.598]  We've been allowing these morons to lie to us and haven't been holding them accountable.
[03:14:02.978 --> 03:14:05.700]  The swamp should have been drained years ago.
[03:14:05.700 --> 03:14:08.021]  It's an awakening that's happening among American people.
[03:14:08.021 --> 03:14:14.565]  Unfortunately, you have delusional people waking up on both sides that think that different worlds are happening.
[03:14:14.565 --> 03:14:21.349]  The real story here is people need to pay attention, the citizens need to unite and focus on holding everyone accountable.
[03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:25.151]  And stop taking the spoon-fed garbage from ABC and CBS and ABC and CNN.
[03:14:25.151 --> 03:14:28.813]  By the way, Matt Dubiel is really a good talk show host, isn't he, folks?
[03:14:28.813 --> 03:14:30.574]  I've known him, like, what, I don't know, about eight, nine years?
[03:14:30.574 --> 03:14:32.035]  It's been a long time.
[03:14:32.895 --> 03:14:35.998]  Well, I'm really excited you've been carrying us off and on for eight, nine years.
[03:14:35.998 --> 03:14:37.980]  And take over, I'm going to stop interrupting.
[03:14:37.980 --> 03:14:40.743]  And I can't wait to get you kind of a quarterback on one of your own shows.
[03:14:40.743 --> 03:14:42.665]  We want to add some more broadcasts here.
[03:14:42.665 --> 03:14:43.626]  We're getting more crew hired.
[03:14:43.626 --> 03:14:44.907]  They're doing a great job.
[03:14:44.907 --> 03:14:47.670]  We had a caller earlier saying, hey, you know why I'm on hold for 20 minutes?
[03:14:47.670 --> 03:14:48.250]  Well, it's because we got...
[03:14:48.911 --> 03:14:51.672]  You know, one person doing two jobs in there, bro.
[03:14:51.672 --> 03:14:56.173]  And that's why we're not taking a lot of calls is it's really a full-time job when you take calls.
[03:14:56.173 --> 03:14:58.073]  So we are a work in progress.
[03:14:58.073 --> 03:15:05.995]  We will admit it to you all day long that InfoWars is a working project and we are not a teleprompter operation.
[03:15:05.995 --> 03:15:08.295]  We don't just cover talking points all day long.
[03:15:08.295 --> 03:15:10.516]  We're just real people who want to have a future.
[03:15:10.956 --> 03:15:12.116]  And who aren't out to get you.
[03:15:12.116 --> 03:15:14.317]  I mean, I think that's what it really comes down to.
[03:15:14.317 --> 03:15:19.499]  So, Matt Dub, WCKG, 1530 AM.
[03:15:19.499 --> 03:15:24.020]  And give folks the FM address as well.
[03:15:24.020 --> 03:15:26.921]  102.3 FM in Chicago, if you're in Elmhurst, Oakbrook.
[03:15:26.921 --> 03:15:30.422]  And we're going to be moving that 102.3 to a very big building.
[03:15:30.422 --> 03:15:31.883]  Very big.
[03:15:31.883 --> 03:15:33.443]  Perhaps the biggest, almost the biggest.
[03:15:33.443 --> 03:15:35.044]  Very huge, very large.
[03:15:36.627 --> 03:15:37.948]  Fantastic.
[03:15:37.948 --> 03:15:39.749]  Tremendous.
[03:15:39.749 --> 03:15:40.390]  You're going to love it.
[03:15:40.390 --> 03:15:41.811]  It's a big, big deal.
[03:15:41.811 --> 03:15:42.451]  Big building.
[03:15:42.451 --> 03:15:43.412]  You're going to love it.
[03:15:43.412 --> 03:15:44.093]  It's going to be fantastic.
[03:15:44.093 --> 03:15:45.173]  On top of it and very large.
[03:15:45.173 --> 03:15:47.675]  We've got an initiative all over the country.
[03:15:47.675 --> 03:15:49.497]  Infowars is going to be on top of certain buildings.
[03:15:53.942 --> 03:15:55.423]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.
[03:15:55.423 --> 03:15:59.185]  The NSA has noticed how much time you spend on conservative news sites.

[03:16:28.367 --> 03:16:31.188]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[03:16:31.188 --> 03:16:31.848]  Awesome.

[03:16:34.950 --> 03:16:36.511]  NASA PAC Technology.
[03:16:36.511 --> 03:16:37.131]  Bacon.
[03:16:37.131 --> 03:16:41.293]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[03:16:41.293 --> 03:16:42.713]  Or warm and served.
[03:16:42.713 --> 03:16:44.774]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[03:16:44.774 --> 03:16:46.715]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[03:17:53.533 --> 03:17:54.354]  I'm so excited.
[03:17:54.354 --> 03:18:04.500]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:18:04.500 --> 03:18:10.004]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:18:10.004 --> 03:18:13.006]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:18:13.006 --> 03:18:21.812]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:18:23.873 --> 03:18:43.482]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:18:43.482 --> 03:18:46.163]  It is amazing!
[03:18:46.163 --> 03:18:51.125]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[03:18:52.927 --> 03:19:12.899]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:19:12.899 --> 03:19:15.021]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:19:15.021 --> 03:19:19.023]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarstore.com.
[03:19:19.023 --> 03:19:20.064]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[03:19:20.464 --> 03:19:26.268]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[03:19:26.268 --> 03:19:28.650]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:19:28.650 --> 03:19:31.291]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[03:19:31.291 --> 03:19:34.093]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:19:34.093 --> 03:19:36.595]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:36.595 --> 03:19:45.781]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:19:45.781 --> 03:19:50.224]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:19:54.832 --> 03:19:57.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:08.723 --> 03:20:15.967]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[03:20:15.967 --> 03:20:19.069]  He is Alex Jones.
[03:20:19.069 --> 03:20:29.876]  It's Matt Dubio filling in for Alex Jones on the mighty Infowars.com forward slash show from Chicago from the WCKG studios here
[03:20:30.436 --> 03:20:34.860]  We broadcast on AM 1530 in Chicago and FM 102.3.
[03:20:34.860 --> 03:20:39.605]  I've been saying today on social media that I love coming in here.
[03:20:39.605 --> 03:20:41.086]  I love talking with you.
[03:20:41.086 --> 03:20:48.693]  It's an hour I look forward to and I typically rotate on Mondays back and forth with Jack and it's something I look forward to.
[03:20:49.474 --> 03:20:53.901]  Some of the things I want to talk with you today are on my mind.
[03:20:53.901 --> 03:20:58.948]  One of those is the NFL situation, not the National Anthems with the NFL.
[03:20:58.948 --> 03:21:01.873]  But, you know, they're talking about these stadiums being empty.
[03:21:02.948 --> 03:21:13.358]  And people attending the games less and less, you'll hear guys like me, guys like Alex, David Knight and so on say that it's because of the national anthem flap and the kneeling and all that sort of stuff.
[03:21:13.358 --> 03:21:14.920]  And part of that's true.
[03:21:14.920 --> 03:21:16.901]  There's really another undertone to that.
[03:21:16.901 --> 03:21:19.124]  And I want to talk about that coming up.
[03:21:19.124 --> 03:21:21.165]  I also want to talk about Facebook's initiative.
[03:21:21.165 --> 03:21:23.528]  Facebook is trying to connect
[03:21:24.028 --> 03:21:25.629]  You and I to our children.
[03:21:25.629 --> 03:21:27.089]  Facebook cares.
[03:21:27.089 --> 03:21:29.530]  And they want to connect us to our children.
[03:21:29.530 --> 03:21:31.551]  And the key word here is connect.
[03:21:31.551 --> 03:21:33.272]  They want to connect your children.
[03:21:33.272 --> 03:21:35.292]  I want to talk about that coming up.
[03:21:35.292 --> 03:21:45.036]  Also, a lot of folks have been talking about this tax break situation and Trump's tax break and the Republicans got it through and, you know, this is going to be great and they say it's going to be terrible.
[03:21:45.036 --> 03:21:47.057]  I have a different take on it altogether.
[03:21:47.057 --> 03:21:51.278]  I don't think that you should even think about the tax situation and I'll explain why.
[03:21:51.278 --> 03:21:52.319]  But as I was sitting here,
[03:21:53.297 --> 03:21:55.359]  Getting ready and watching Alex.
[03:21:55.359 --> 03:21:57.882]  I actually do listen to the show on my own station.
[03:21:57.882 --> 03:21:59.364]  I actually do watch Alex.
[03:21:59.364 --> 03:22:06.192]  I watch David Knight and Owen and some of the other hosts that are doing shows here because we're in it, man.
[03:22:06.192 --> 03:22:07.393]  We're in it!
[03:22:07.393 --> 03:22:07.713]  Okay?
[03:22:07.713 --> 03:22:13.260]  It's not just, we don't have these shows on this radio station because it's sensational or because it's...
[03:22:13.920 --> 03:22:16.422]  Uh, you know, nouveau or because it's sexy.
[03:22:16.422 --> 03:22:19.944]  We do this because we're in it and I'm in it with you.
[03:22:19.944 --> 03:22:32.592]  So I was watching Alex and I flipped over to DrudgeReport.com and I see the story at DrudgeReport.com as I'm planning, intending fully to talk about these other things that are on my mind and something just kind of stuck in my craw.
[03:22:33.974 --> 03:22:35.696]  I'm not that old.
[03:22:35.696 --> 03:22:39.398]  I'm only 41, but I say old-timey phrases like, stuck in my craw.
[03:22:39.398 --> 03:22:41.540]  It's just part of my old school upbringing.
[03:22:41.540 --> 03:22:43.262]  But something's stuck in my craw.
[03:22:43.262 --> 03:22:46.384]  And the thing that's stuck in my craw is this headline.
[03:22:46.384 --> 03:22:48.606]  This is CNN.
[03:22:48.606 --> 03:22:51.688]  Acosta says, journalists have to resist.
[03:22:52.569 --> 03:23:03.113]  Now, there was a guy, I don't know if you'd call him a journalist or not, he was a former sportscaster, and a really annoying, really unlikable guy named Keith Oberman.
[03:23:03.113 --> 03:23:05.514]  And he's been on Twitter for a while.
[03:23:05.514 --> 03:23:10.736]  He started doing a little cute little web series from his, I think his mother's basement.
[03:23:10.736 --> 03:23:15.657]  And it sounded very echoey, so it might have been in the bathroom in his mother's basement.
[03:23:15.657 --> 03:23:16.718]  And he called the show
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:18.801]  The Resistance.
[03:23:18.801 --> 03:23:26.609]  And it was pretty funny because for years now InfoWars and Alex Jones have been saying, you are the Resistance.
[03:23:26.609 --> 03:23:37.280]  Keith came in and said, I'm going to do a show for a magazine called GQ that's failing and we're going to call it The Resistance and we're going to be smarmy and liberal and it's going to take off like gangbusters.
[03:23:38.426 --> 03:23:39.127]  And it didn't.
[03:23:39.127 --> 03:23:40.848]  It failed miserably.
[03:23:40.848 --> 03:23:52.635]  And not only did it fail miserably across the spectrum, but more importantly, more notably, it failed miserably among liberal people that should be really into his sort of content.
[03:23:52.635 --> 03:23:59.460]  So this concept that quote-unquote journalists have to resist, I think first we have to define what the hell a journalist is.
[03:24:00.060 --> 03:24:21.023]  It really stuck in my craw because Acosta is a reporter for CNN, and I wouldn't call myself a reporter, but I was at the Trump rally in Chicago when then-candidate Donald Trump was running for president and had scheduled an appearance to be at a college campus here for a Trump rally.
[03:24:21.844 --> 03:24:31.087]  And I got press passes because I'm in the press, even though I wouldn't necessarily say I'm a journalist or a reporter, I'm definitely in the press.
[03:24:31.087 --> 03:24:40.531]  So I was in the press box, my wife and I went, and as many of you know who have followed the campaign, one of these sort of political theater events
[03:24:41.551 --> 03:24:43.873]  Happened, where the event was shut down.
[03:24:43.873 --> 03:24:51.177]  It was cancelled by Trump, but it was cancelled because it was taken over by what is essentially Antifa.
[03:24:51.177 --> 03:25:00.524]  It was taken over by a fund, a group funded by George Soros under the guise of SEIU, which is an acronym for something.
[03:25:00.524 --> 03:25:07.808]  Some commie organization of some sort that pays people $10 and $15 an hour to come and disrupt events.
[03:25:07.808 --> 03:25:09.610]  Now, I'm telling you about this event.
[03:25:10.390 --> 03:25:14.654]  And you could see my video after the fact if you go to my Facebook page.
[03:25:14.654 --> 03:25:17.656]  It's the one with the blue checkmark that says Matt Dubio.
[03:25:17.656 --> 03:25:23.061]  And I did a video immediately following that experience because it got so bad inside.
[03:25:23.061 --> 03:25:30.228]  These paid agitators who were part of a sort of Antifa-like group, they were not Trump supporters.
[03:25:30.228 --> 03:25:31.329]  The Trump supporters were there.
[03:25:32.318 --> 03:25:36.521]  And the Trump supporters were exactly who you'd expect them to be.
[03:25:36.521 --> 03:25:38.142]  They were retirees.
[03:25:38.142 --> 03:25:39.162]  They were grandparents.
[03:25:39.162 --> 03:25:40.443]  They were parents.
[03:25:40.443 --> 03:25:43.065]  They were Americans waving the red, white and blue.
[03:25:43.065 --> 03:25:49.809]  They were beautiful people there to support what they believed to be a really great movement, a really big
[03:25:50.129 --> 03:25:50.350]  Thank you.
[03:26:04.685 --> 03:26:09.667]  In the press pit and overheard in the press pit was Acosta.
[03:26:09.667 --> 03:26:15.149]  Acosta at that point was basically just a very low-level CNN reporter.
[03:26:15.149 --> 03:26:17.229]  He was in the field, on the road.
[03:26:17.229 --> 03:26:19.710]  I don't know that anybody really knew his name.
[03:26:19.710 --> 03:26:25.052]  I just remember his face and I remember listening in and watching him and hearing him talk to the other reporters.
[03:26:26.331 --> 03:26:29.995]  You should hear what he said to the other reporters.
[03:26:29.995 --> 03:26:32.237]  You should hear the things he was saying.
[03:26:32.237 --> 03:26:37.642]  I might have some of them on my phone because we were recording, and you know, you hear everything.
[03:26:37.642 --> 03:26:41.907]  And the way that he was talking about the people, American people,
[03:26:42.427 --> 03:26:48.232]  Was along the lines of Hillary and her deplorable gaffe when she called Trump supporters deplorables.
[03:26:48.232 --> 03:26:53.737]  If you would have heard the things that Jim Acosta was saying about the Trump supporters.
[03:26:53.737 --> 03:27:00.403]  If you would have heard the things that Jim Acosta was saying about Trump and the candidacy and the campaign in general.
[03:27:00.403 --> 03:27:03.806]  As an objective journalist and reporter.
[03:27:05.046 --> 03:27:07.588]  You might become sick to your stomach.
[03:27:07.588 --> 03:27:15.795]  I believe that good people that are liberal and democratic, if they would have heard the things he was saying at that point, would have been sick to their stomach.
[03:27:15.795 --> 03:27:21.500]  I believe that if the managers and the editors at CNN would have heard those things,
[03:27:21.980 --> 03:27:30.425]  If they were a real news organization, if they were a professional institution, if they would have heard these things, they would have pulled them and they would have said, well, wait a minute.
[03:27:30.425 --> 03:27:35.968]  We can't have somebody that says these things and thinks these things, covering an event like this.
[03:27:35.968 --> 03:27:37.969]  This guy is not objective.
[03:27:37.969 --> 03:27:42.092]  There's a reason why Jim Acosta, is that his first name, Jim?
[03:27:42.092 --> 03:27:43.853]  I'm just going to call him Acosta.
[03:27:43.853 --> 03:27:45.714]  I don't want to make idiots famous.
[03:27:45.714 --> 03:27:46.454]  Thank you.
[03:27:46.454 --> 03:27:47.835]  It is Jim Acosta.
[03:27:47.835 --> 03:27:50.657]  I'm really against this idea of making morons famous.
[03:27:51.832 --> 03:27:54.113]  It's something we all have to stop.
[03:27:54.113 --> 03:27:58.616]  One of the dumbest things Hillary did was mention Alex Jones' name.
[03:27:58.616 --> 03:27:59.457]  Not because he's a moron.
[03:27:59.457 --> 03:28:00.177]  He's not a moron.
[03:28:00.177 --> 03:28:02.859]  But she gives power and promotes Alex Jones.
[03:28:02.859 --> 03:28:04.660]  Now people go and they want to find out more.
[03:28:04.660 --> 03:28:05.460]  Okay, who's this guy?
[03:28:05.460 --> 03:28:06.481]  What's he about?
[03:28:06.481 --> 03:28:09.443]  The haters could become people that are listening a little bit.
[03:28:09.443 --> 03:28:12.205]  So I don't really want to give Acosta any attention.
[03:28:12.205 --> 03:28:15.747]  But this Acosta guy is going to be in the news.
[03:28:15.747 --> 03:28:17.468]  And he's going to push himself in the news.
[03:28:17.828 --> 03:28:17.888]  As
[03:28:34.139 --> 03:28:42.709]  He's hoping that those who hire guys like him will see that he can get attention and he has followers and then they will give him a gig.
[03:28:42.709 --> 03:28:45.151]  This is rampant and it's happening more and more.
[03:28:45.151 --> 03:28:48.615]  I'll share with you exactly why and how it works coming up next.
[03:28:48.615 --> 03:28:51.999]  More with InfoWars.com forward slash show from Chicago.

[03:32:54.307 --> 03:32:56.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:10.592 --> 03:33:19.882]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commencement in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:19.882 --> 03:33:21.143]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:24.494 --> 03:33:25.955]  It's Matt Dubio from Chicago.
[03:33:25.955 --> 03:33:32.017]  The murder capital of the Midwest, definitely the murder capital of the United States.
[03:33:32.017 --> 03:33:33.218]  It's arguable.
[03:33:33.218 --> 03:33:39.861]  They try and conflate the figures to make it seem like based on population it's not that bad, but it's bad.
[03:33:39.861 --> 03:33:43.882]  There's already eight people shot and killed in Chicago in the month of December.
[03:33:43.882 --> 03:33:45.203]  It's only the 4th of December.
[03:33:46.075 --> 03:33:50.899]  I mean, it is Las Vegas in slow motion every month in Chicago.
[03:33:50.899 --> 03:33:51.679]  Nobody cares.
[03:33:51.679 --> 03:33:53.161]  Nobody talks about it.
[03:33:53.161 --> 03:33:53.941]  We talk about it.
[03:33:53.941 --> 03:33:58.325]  We focus on it on the top of every newscast on WCKG here.
[03:33:58.325 --> 03:34:02.328]  AM 1530, FM 102.3, WCKG.com.
[03:34:02.328 --> 03:34:03.949]  You can see the statistics.
[03:34:03.949 --> 03:34:05.110]  They're sobering.
[03:34:05.610 --> 03:34:09.393]  At Chicago's Alternative dot com, because we post the news there.
[03:34:09.393 --> 03:34:14.756]  So you see that 36 people died from gunshot wounds in November.
[03:34:14.756 --> 03:34:17.237]  39 people died in November in Chicago.
[03:34:17.237 --> 03:34:19.299]  Homicides, carjackings are up.
[03:34:19.299 --> 03:34:21.760]  I mean, things are just out of control.
[03:34:21.760 --> 03:34:22.441]  And here we are.
[03:34:22.441 --> 03:34:24.242]  It's the holiday season.
[03:34:24.242 --> 03:34:27.144]  It's the time to be thinking of others and the time to be giving.
[03:34:27.984 --> 03:34:31.487]  All Jim Acosta cares about is trying to find a new job.
[03:34:31.487 --> 03:34:34.550]  And here's how you know that's what's going on.
[03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:36.012]  Megyn Kelly did the same thing.
[03:34:36.012 --> 03:34:38.314]  OK, I see this stuff a mile away.
[03:34:38.314 --> 03:34:40.816]  It's maybe because I'm in that business.
[03:34:40.816 --> 03:34:41.557]  I don't know.
[03:34:41.557 --> 03:34:42.958]  But I see it a mile away.
[03:34:42.958 --> 03:34:44.800]  What they do is they posture first.
[03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:48.622]  And they telegraphed everybody that they're not what you think they are.
[03:34:48.622 --> 03:34:55.045]  So Megyn Kelly had to posture and show the world, well, I'm not this conservative talking head.
[03:34:55.045 --> 03:34:56.165]  I'm versatile.
[03:34:56.165 --> 03:34:57.326]  I'm different.
[03:34:57.326 --> 03:35:01.007]  I can also throw it to the, you know, I can give the Republicans some trouble.
[03:35:01.007 --> 03:35:01.768]  I can do this.
[03:35:01.768 --> 03:35:02.468]  I can do that.
[03:35:02.468 --> 03:35:05.589]  And then she uses it when it's time to find a new gig.
[03:35:05.589 --> 03:35:07.590]  That's what Acosta's trying to do.
[03:35:07.590 --> 03:35:09.351]  That's what the NFL is doing.
[03:35:09.631 --> 03:35:10.911]  And I'm going to get into that.
[03:35:10.911 --> 03:35:16.112]  The reason why the NFL is failing isn't because of the kneeling issue.
[03:35:16.112 --> 03:35:17.012]  Okay?
[03:35:17.012 --> 03:35:18.593]  That's expediting it.
[03:35:18.593 --> 03:35:19.593]  It's speeding it up.
[03:35:19.593 --> 03:35:21.293]  It's making it go much faster.
[03:35:21.293 --> 03:35:23.414]  Very, very fast.
[03:35:23.414 --> 03:35:27.074]  The fastest destruction, perhaps, in major sports.
[03:35:27.074 --> 03:35:28.235]  But that's not the cause.
[03:35:28.235 --> 03:35:32.615]  It's actually part of... There's a cause before that, which is why they're doing it.
[03:35:32.615 --> 03:35:33.696]  I'm going to get into that in a minute.
[03:35:35.667 --> 03:35:37.731]  I just, uh, we were just holiday shopping.
[03:35:37.731 --> 03:35:43.620]  My wife and I were just Christmas shopping for friends and family, and inevitably we're thinking about, like, what do we get people?
[03:35:43.620 --> 03:35:48.468]  And the best thing that I think you can do right now is get people things that will help them.
[03:35:49.546 --> 03:35:52.947]  And get them from places that do good things.
[03:35:52.947 --> 03:35:55.848]  What better place to do that than the InfoWars store?
[03:35:55.848 --> 03:36:01.130]  And right now if you get gift cards for Christmas at 10% off in the InfoWars store.
[03:36:01.130 --> 03:36:02.891]  So InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:02.891 --> 03:36:04.391]  And here's what I recommend.
[03:36:04.391 --> 03:36:09.253]  Rather than just get like a gift card that you know and then just give it to somebody and say here you go.
[03:36:09.253 --> 03:36:12.374]  Especially somebody that doesn't maybe know what InfoWars is.
[03:36:12.374 --> 03:36:13.335]  You get them like a $50 gift card.
[03:36:14.235 --> 03:36:17.677]  A hundred bucks, $150 or whatever so they can get a few things.
[03:36:17.677 --> 03:36:18.518]  I'll give you an example.
[03:36:18.518 --> 03:36:22.481]  I was at my family Christmas party for the Italian family.
[03:36:22.481 --> 03:36:24.482]  We've been doing this for a hundred years.
[03:36:24.482 --> 03:36:29.506]  Obviously, I personally haven't been there for a hundred years, but the family party's been going on for a hundred years.
[03:36:29.506 --> 03:36:32.387]  One of my cousins asked me about brain force, okay?
[03:36:33.328 --> 03:36:35.789]  And she said, you know, I've been seeing you on Alex Jones.
[03:36:35.789 --> 03:36:37.230]  You know, do you really take brain force?
[03:36:37.230 --> 03:36:37.890]  Yes.
[03:36:37.890 --> 03:36:39.451]  And that's why this one is empty.
[03:36:39.451 --> 03:36:40.291]  I'm out.
[03:36:40.291 --> 03:36:42.572]  There's some rattling in here, but it's that little cellulite.
[03:36:42.572 --> 03:36:45.053]  It's the thing that soaks up the moisture.
[03:36:45.053 --> 03:36:46.493]  And this one is empty.
[03:36:46.493 --> 03:36:48.994]  I took two this morning after I ate breakfast.
[03:36:48.994 --> 03:36:57.138]  So instead of just getting some generic gift card and then hoping that they find their way, I recommend you get them like a hundred bucks gift card.
[03:36:57.138 --> 03:37:02.800]  You know, you print out the piece of paper, whatever it is, and then you give them a couple of recommendations of things that you like.
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:06.002]  And then you pop it in there and say, here's what you can do with it.
[03:37:06.002 --> 03:37:07.602]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:37:07.602 --> 03:37:09.163]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:37:09.163 --> 03:37:11.465]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:37:11.465 --> 03:37:12.785]  I don't need to tell you.
[03:37:12.785 --> 03:37:14.686]  That helps support everything.
[03:37:14.686 --> 03:37:20.890]  Why would you shop at some dopey place like Amazon and get garbage that you're going to have to send back anyway?
[03:37:20.890 --> 03:37:25.952]  Shop at a place where you know the money's going to good stuff and the people are doing good things.
[03:37:25.952 --> 03:37:29.094]  That guy that called and was griping about the call screener.
[03:37:29.094 --> 03:37:32.496]  By the way, the staff at Infowars are like the best in broadcasting.
[03:37:32.876 --> 03:37:35.518]  I'm not just saying that because they're controlling my microphone right now.
[03:37:35.518 --> 03:37:36.939]  I'm saying it because it's true.
[03:37:36.939 --> 03:37:41.262]  So, they do it like 100% better than anybody else.
[03:37:41.262 --> 03:37:45.144]  If you want InfoWars to get bigger, then go buy more stuff there.
[03:37:45.144 --> 03:37:45.905]  That's how it works.
[03:37:47.611 --> 03:37:48.632]  Anyway, back to the NFL.
[03:37:48.632 --> 03:37:50.313]  In fact, this ties into the NFL.
[03:37:50.313 --> 03:37:51.434]  Here's why.
[03:37:51.434 --> 03:37:53.416]  The NFL is struggling.
[03:37:53.416 --> 03:37:56.559]  The NFL is struggling and the seats are empty at the Bears games.
[03:37:56.559 --> 03:37:59.741]  The seats are empty at the Patriots games.
[03:37:59.741 --> 03:38:03.404]  The seats are empty at various games around the country, okay?
[03:38:03.404 --> 03:38:05.686]  And everyone is saying that it's because of the Kneelers.
[03:38:05.686 --> 03:38:07.848]  They're saying that it's because of the National Anthem.
[03:38:07.848 --> 03:38:10.851]  But this trend has been happening for years and years.
[03:38:11.531 --> 03:38:15.172]  It's going on, and it's been going on for some time, and there's a reason for this.
[03:38:15.172 --> 03:38:24.195]  And people that have been going to professional sporting events, if you've ever taken your kid to a baseball game, or someone you love, a niece or a nephew, or your family.
[03:38:24.195 --> 03:38:29.677]  I have four kids, and typically when we go someplace, a lot of times we'll bring a friend with for the kids.
[03:38:30.197 --> 03:38:33.779]  Or we'll bring my parents or in-laws or whoever.
[03:38:33.779 --> 03:38:37.820]  So, now you've got seven, eight people going someplace, okay?
[03:38:37.820 --> 03:38:45.063]  Do the math on how much it costs to take three, four, five, six, seven people to a professional sporting event.
[03:38:45.063 --> 03:38:50.366]  It costs $50 alone just to park at Soldier Field in Chicago, let alone the tickets.
[03:38:50.366 --> 03:38:54.668]  Then you factor in what they're going to charge you for something to drink, for something to eat.
[03:38:54.668 --> 03:38:55.248]  The reason
[03:38:55.948 --> 03:39:01.690]  Why those stadiums in the NFL are getting emptier and emptier day by day.
[03:39:01.690 --> 03:39:02.990]  And this is the truth.
[03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:04.351]  This is what they don't want you to know about.
[03:39:04.351 --> 03:39:06.111]  This is what they're not talking about.
[03:39:06.111 --> 03:39:09.872]  It's because of the erosion of the middle class.
[03:39:09.872 --> 03:39:21.436]  It's because the gap between those who have disposable money to spend on those sorts of things and those who don't is getting wider and wider and wider.
[03:39:22.392 --> 03:39:26.974]  And the lie is that you're in the middle class.
[03:39:26.974 --> 03:39:32.376]  The lie is that you're in the middle class.
[03:39:32.376 --> 03:39:34.096]  You think you're in the middle class.
[03:39:34.096 --> 03:39:43.019]  It's like asking people on the street if they're a Democrat or Republican and then reconciling that to what the definition of a Democrat or Republican is.
[03:39:43.019 --> 03:39:45.620]  Most people don't even know what the real definition is.
[03:39:45.620 --> 03:39:47.961]  They just think they align a certain way.
[03:39:47.961 --> 03:39:49.842]  Most of us think that we're in the middle class.
[03:39:51.138 --> 03:39:57.883]  Do you know that a million dollars is not enough to retire anymore if you're middle class?
[03:39:57.883 --> 03:40:04.707]  Do you know that the average American doesn't have $5,000 saved?
[03:40:04.707 --> 03:40:06.789]  The average American doesn't have even $2,500 saved?
[03:40:10.208 --> 03:40:29.767]  If you figure out how much it costs to go to a baseball game or a football game, the reason why there are dwindling attendance records is because more and more people are taking that money and they're buying a big plasma screen or an LCD screen for their house because they can use it over and over again.
[03:40:29.767 --> 03:40:35.172]  And they're already paying their mortgage and their electric bill and all of the other utilities and their high-speed internet.
[03:40:35.976 --> 03:40:37.718]  And they've already invested in that stuff.
[03:40:37.718 --> 03:40:52.815]  And it's much simpler and much more cost effective and less hassle and much more enjoyable to go and watch it in your own home and invite people over than it is to waste money to go and make millionaires more rich.
[03:40:52.815 --> 03:40:56.479]  And ostensibly billionaires even more rich.
[03:40:57.998 --> 03:41:00.920]  By the way, here's a fun little question.
[03:41:00.920 --> 03:41:04.142]  And if you think you know the answer, tweet it to me, at Matt on Air.
[03:41:04.142 --> 03:41:08.704]  How much is a billion dollars?
[03:41:08.704 --> 03:41:13.227]  How many millions is one billion dollars?
[03:41:13.227 --> 03:41:17.870]  Ask ten people on the street how much a billion dollars is.
[03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:20.091]  Ask them to define a billion dollars.
[03:41:20.091 --> 03:41:21.892]  We all know what a million dollars is, right?
[03:41:21.892 --> 03:41:23.073]  It's a thousand thousands.
[03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:26.231]  Seems kind of somewhat attainable.
[03:41:26.231 --> 03:41:31.516]  It's why for years and years, middle class, middle Americans have aspired to become millionaires.
[03:41:31.516 --> 03:41:33.498]  It seems attainable.
[03:41:33.498 --> 03:41:35.099]  It's a thousand thousands.
[03:41:35.099 --> 03:41:37.982]  Many of you will make a million dollars in your lifetime.
[03:41:39.304 --> 03:41:43.666]  Most of us won't hold a million dollars in our lifetime.
[03:41:43.666 --> 03:41:55.069]  And even if you get a million dollars in your lifetime and save a million dollars, according to the statistics, a million dollars isn't going to be enough for you to retire in a middle-class lifestyle.
[03:41:55.069 --> 03:41:57.570]  That's why this tax plan doesn't really matter.
[03:41:57.570 --> 03:42:02.732]  Friend, it doesn't have anything to do with how much money the government is taking from you.
[03:42:02.732 --> 03:42:05.093]  Yeah, it would be great if they didn't take so much.
[03:42:05.093 --> 03:42:07.814]  It has to do with the amount of money you're making
[03:42:08.760 --> 03:42:14.006]  What you're doing to make that money and what kind of power you have with that dollar.
[03:42:14.006 --> 03:42:23.637]  And one of the reasons why Bitcoin is over $10,000, it's probably over $11,000 right now, isn't because Bitcoin is worth so much.
[03:42:23.637 --> 03:42:25.739]  It's because your dollar isn't worth so much.
[03:42:26.761 --> 03:42:28.123]  Almost anything.
[03:42:28.123 --> 03:42:32.387]  It's because the dollar value is going down and down and down.
[03:42:32.387 --> 03:42:36.050]  A billion dollars used to be something different.
[03:42:36.050 --> 03:42:41.656]  Today, the definition of a billion dollars is only a thousand millions.
[03:42:41.656 --> 03:42:44.419]  Those billionaires don't have as much money as you think.
[03:42:44.419 --> 03:42:47.422]  There's something going on with the economy that no one's talking about.
[03:42:47.702 --> 03:42:52.228]  Coming up, we're going to talk about Facebook and what they want to do to connect you with your kids.
[03:42:52.228 --> 03:42:52.568]  It's up next.
[03:42:52.568 --> 03:42:53.309]  I'm so excited.
[03:42:53.309 --> 03:43:03.462]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:43:03.462 --> 03:43:05.544]  This is a heart and brain pill.
[03:43:06.425 --> 03:43:11.973]  A nootropic doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:43:11.973 --> 03:43:20.765]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:43:22.848 --> 03:43:28.152]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:43:28.152 --> 03:43:31.055]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:43:31.055 --> 03:43:42.444]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:43:42.444 --> 03:43:45.146]  It is amazing!
[03:43:45.146 --> 03:43:50.110]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[03:43:52.105 --> 03:44:01.569]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar, a 360 win.

[03:44:56.153 --> 03:45:00.816]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:45:00.816 --> 03:45:02.338]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[03:45:03.393 --> 03:45:08.015]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:45:08.015 --> 03:45:10.356]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:45:10.356 --> 03:45:12.157]  B vitamins we need every day.
[03:45:12.157 --> 03:45:17.419]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:45:17.419 --> 03:45:19.040]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[03:45:19.720 --> 03:45:25.384]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:45:25.384 --> 03:45:28.386]  Secret 12, optimal absorption.
[03:45:28.386 --> 03:45:33.530]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[03:45:33.530 --> 03:45:38.593]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[03:45:38.593 --> 03:45:39.434]  Optimum levels.
[03:45:40.875 --> 03:45:45.020]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[03:45:45.020 --> 03:45:50.205]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.
[03:45:50.205 --> 03:45:52.648]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:52.648 --> 03:45:57.413]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWarsLife Prostagard.
[03:45:57.413 --> 03:46:01.217]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[03:46:01.818 --> 03:46:13.042]  InfoWarsLife has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[03:46:13.042 --> 03:46:21.024]  The Prostagard formula does just that, with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[03:46:21.024 --> 03:46:25.946]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols,
[03:46:26.486 --> 03:46:27.487]  We're good to go.
[03:46:53.693 --> 03:46:56.312]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:05.214 --> 03:47:07.815]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:07.815 --> 03:47:13.956]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:47:13.956 --> 03:47:24.638]  It's Matt Dubio in for Alex Jones for the fourth hour for Monday, December 4th, already eight dead in Chicago, sadly.
[03:47:24.638 --> 03:47:31.019]  It's Las Vegas in slow motion every day here in Chicago and it's got to stop.
[03:47:31.019 --> 03:47:32.840]  Somebody's got to do something about it.
[03:47:32.840 --> 03:47:34.300]  Facebook wants to connect
[03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:37.841]  Me to my children.
[03:47:37.841 --> 03:47:47.244]  They believe that the best way to connect me to my children is to connect the children to the Facebook.
[03:47:47.244 --> 03:47:52.386]  There's not enough people using Facebook, so they want me to give, they want you and I to give the children
[03:47:53.146 --> 03:48:03.680]  to the Facebook so Facebook can lull them into a little sleep and make them digital idiots like the rest of us who spend way too much time on social media.
[03:48:03.680 --> 03:48:05.402]  Don't you think that's a good idea?
[03:48:05.402 --> 03:48:10.288]  As you think about turning your children over to Facebook in an app where they can use
[03:48:11.280 --> 03:48:24.164]  The same features to make the little mouse face and help the social recognition software improve itself and the AI build up intelligence on how the faces work and all that stuff.
[03:48:24.164 --> 03:48:32.187]  When you think about doing that with your children, or I should say letting your children have that done to them by the Facebook,
[03:48:33.373 --> 03:48:40.017]  Think about any other institutions that you've turned your children over to over the years.
[03:48:40.017 --> 03:48:41.618]  And how it's gone.
[03:48:41.618 --> 03:48:43.239]  Daycare centers.
[03:48:43.239 --> 03:48:45.160]  What happens when you send your kids to daycare?
[03:48:46.533 --> 03:48:47.174]  How does it go?
[03:48:47.174 --> 03:48:48.715]  How does it work out for you?
[03:48:48.715 --> 03:48:49.196]  I don't know.
[03:48:49.196 --> 03:48:51.378]  I'm asking because I don't send my kids to daycare.
[03:48:51.378 --> 03:48:52.880]  I never have.
[03:48:52.880 --> 03:48:54.261]  We don't do that.
[03:48:54.261 --> 03:48:56.524]  Our kids have never had a babysitter that isn't family.
[03:48:56.524 --> 03:49:04.993]  I'm not judging you, but when I look at what happens in daycare centers, when I look at what happens with our most important
[03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:11.013]  I don't want to say assets, because my children aren't assets.
[03:49:11.013 --> 03:49:11.874]  They're part of me.
[03:49:11.874 --> 03:49:16.416]  They're part of my DNA and my love.
[03:49:16.416 --> 03:49:18.778]  They embody everything I'm here for.
[03:49:18.778 --> 03:49:26.663]  I can't even imagine handing them over to Facebook and saying, yeah, let me let them connect you.
[03:49:26.663 --> 03:49:31.526]  When I think about what the Facebook experience is like, in the beginning it was really cool.
[03:49:32.659 --> 03:49:50.549]  It's like, it's like if you ever started smoking back when you were a teenager and back when, you know, in the 80s and the 90s when people smoked before vaping and all this other stuff came out and you started smoking because it was kind of cool and other people were doing it and then you could, you know, and then eventually you went, oh, this isn't really good.
[03:49:50.549 --> 03:49:53.731]  I don't really feel good when I'm doing this.
[03:49:53.731 --> 03:49:56.673]  I should probably stop doing this.
[03:49:56.673 --> 03:50:00.555]  But then you talk yourself into continuing and you're like, well, I just won't do it as much.
[03:50:01.135 --> 03:50:02.975]  I'll just have one every now and then.
[03:50:02.975 --> 03:50:05.536]  So you pop on Facebook every now and then.
[03:50:05.536 --> 03:50:11.257]  And just like a cigarette, every one that you have is not as good as the last one.
[03:50:11.257 --> 03:50:16.358]  And before you know it, you're like, man, I get on this Facebook and I get angry.
[03:50:16.358 --> 03:50:18.178]  I see things I don't want to see.
[03:50:18.178 --> 03:50:20.318]  I see sides of people I don't want to see.
[03:50:20.318 --> 03:50:22.219]  I don't like Facebook.
[03:50:22.219 --> 03:50:26.039]  And then you're snapping at people because you were on Facebook.
[03:50:26.039 --> 03:50:28.440]  Is that the experience you want for your 6 to 12 year old?
[03:50:30.109 --> 03:50:35.170]  It seems like some people on Facebook, surprisingly enough, are pretty excited about it.
[03:50:35.170 --> 03:50:39.651]  Today at Facebook... This is from Facebook Messenger.
[03:50:39.651 --> 03:50:50.073]  Today at Facebook, we're excited to introduce Messenger Kids, a new app that makes it easier for kids to safely video chat and message with family and friends.
[03:50:50.073 --> 03:50:51.794]  Here's what I do when I want to talk to my kids.
[03:50:53.014 --> 03:50:54.035]  Check this out.
[03:50:54.035 --> 03:50:57.916]  What I do is, like tonight, we're having Italian chicken.
[03:50:57.916 --> 03:51:00.017]  And my wife is making it.
[03:51:00.017 --> 03:51:03.918]  So what we're going to do is we're all going to get together in the same room.
[03:51:03.918 --> 03:51:06.980]  All four children.
[03:51:06.980 --> 03:51:09.481]  15, 13, 10, and 5.
[03:51:09.481 --> 03:51:11.121]  And both parental units.
[03:51:11.121 --> 03:51:12.762]  We're all going to get into the same room.
[03:51:13.402 --> 03:51:22.486]  And we're going to sit down at this thing called a dinner table and we're going to break bread, although we probably won't have any bread, but we're going to have Italian chicken and we're going to eat the chicken together.
[03:51:22.486 --> 03:51:28.288]  And then we're going to talk to each other with our mouths and look at each other with our eyes and...
[03:51:29.909 --> 03:51:41.597]  This amazing thing happens because you have software, a software-like system in your brain that interprets the vibrations from the other people's mouths through your eyes and through your mouth.
[03:51:41.597 --> 03:51:44.059]  And then you have what's called a conversation.
[03:51:44.059 --> 03:51:45.680]  That's what we're going to do at our house.
[03:51:45.680 --> 03:51:55.468]  But the rest of the morons around the United States and around the planet are going to get involved in the early phases of connecting their children to the Matrix.
[03:51:55.948 --> 03:52:02.156]  The beta version of the Matrix, which is Facebook, which is Snapchat, which is Twitter and everything else.
[03:52:02.156 --> 03:52:04.639]  And you could say, yeah, well, you know, you're on Facebook, Matt.
[03:52:04.639 --> 03:52:05.320]  Yes, I am.
[03:52:06.742 --> 03:52:16.410]  And not a day goes by when I don't think, gosh, I wonder what would happen if I never would have told my wife about this thing called Facebook back in 2008 or 2007.
[03:52:16.410 --> 03:52:19.413]  She would have found it on her own.
[03:52:19.413 --> 03:52:20.734]  She's an adult.
[03:52:20.734 --> 03:52:22.535]  Her brain is done developing.
[03:52:22.535 --> 03:52:26.779]  But the concept of, you know, when you look at these research studies,
[03:52:27.299 --> 03:52:34.723]  And you find out what is involved in the development of a child's brain from the time that they're 6 years old until they're 12 years old.
[03:52:34.723 --> 03:52:45.229]  And then you look into what they're exposed to when they put these devices next to their heads, which pretty much every expert tells you, don't put the device next to your head.
[03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:48.131]  Don't hold the device next to your head.
[03:52:48.131 --> 03:52:54.114]  If you have to use something, use headphones or something else, because this device is a nuclear device.
[03:52:54.114 --> 03:52:55.655]  It's got radiation in it.
[03:52:56.195 --> 03:53:06.842]  And it's going to heat up the cells in your brain, and especially if you're a developing young mind that's maybe 6, 7, 8 years old or higher, it's not good for your mind.
[03:53:06.842 --> 03:53:09.504]  Pretty much all these studies are coming out that's saying this.
[03:53:09.504 --> 03:53:15.468]  In addition to that, right, you have only a few years of having these devices out on the planet.
[03:53:15.468 --> 03:53:17.709]  So we also don't have enough information.
[03:53:18.610 --> 03:53:34.162]  But the information we do have on social media, everything points to less screen time, less use of devices, especially, especially if you're a developing young brain.
[03:53:34.162 --> 03:53:40.547]  So why in the world would Facebook, one of the biggest companies on planet Earth,
[03:53:41.772 --> 03:53:46.878]  Perhaps the biggest communication monopoly on planet Earth.
[03:53:46.878 --> 03:54:03.555]  Why would Facebook suggest to you and your children and your family that you hook your kids up to a platform that requires them to use these devices more, to fry their brains more, and make them stupider?
[03:54:04.642 --> 03:54:05.622]  Why would they do that?
[03:54:05.622 --> 03:54:07.303]  You think they don't have the data?
[03:54:07.303 --> 03:54:16.727]  You think they haven't been watching everything that's going on with algorithms, number one, and then with medical research and habits?
[03:54:16.727 --> 03:54:21.869]  All this stuff is habit forming and what's happening is people are unplugging.
[03:54:21.869 --> 03:54:26.471]  People are stopping, adults are ceasing to use these platforms as much.
[03:54:26.471 --> 03:54:29.593]  You have smart people that never got on them in the first place.
[03:54:29.593 --> 03:54:32.374]  So we know that Facebook, we know there's data, okay?
[03:54:33.530 --> 03:54:36.851]  We know that Facebook has this data.
[03:54:36.851 --> 03:54:53.798]  Even if they didn't come up with it, just like the cigarette companies, just like the pharmaceutical companies, just like the cellular companies, just like the water pollution monitors and the FDA, we know that there's research out there that these companies have access to.
[03:54:54.912 --> 03:55:00.418]  And if there's research out there that has to do with your company and your Facebook, you're the Zuckerbergs.
[03:55:00.418 --> 03:55:02.461]  Are you going to look at that research no matter what?
[03:55:02.461 --> 03:55:03.922]  Of course you are.
[03:55:03.922 --> 03:55:12.972]  There's email chains, there's a data flow, there's a paper trail or a digital trail of them knowing about all of the downsides.
[03:55:13.693 --> 03:55:19.157]  Of you and I using this stuff, and the downsides of developing brains using this stuff.
[03:55:19.157 --> 03:55:26.243]  And yet, they're happy to announce, they're excited to introduce Messenger Kids!
[03:55:26.243 --> 03:55:31.787]  Now, there's a reason why Facebook wasn't set up for people under 13 in the beginning.
[03:55:31.787 --> 03:55:32.848]  And look at what's happened.
[03:55:34.226 --> 03:55:39.948]  But the problem for Facebook and all of these social platforms is you and I are using them less.
[03:55:39.948 --> 03:55:45.210]  And so they need to train the new generation, the younger folks, to use them more.
[03:55:45.210 --> 03:55:46.491]  So they need to get it in.
[03:55:46.491 --> 03:55:48.572]  That's why they have Chromebooks at their school.
[03:55:48.572 --> 03:55:51.513]  That's why they got them on Google's programs at school.
[03:55:51.513 --> 03:55:55.695]  That's why they had them using Macs when we were in school and PCs before that.
[03:55:55.695 --> 03:55:59.396]  And it's a very dangerous, slippery slope.
[03:55:59.396 --> 03:56:00.797]  The beauty is, is you have the choice.
[03:56:01.357 --> 03:56:03.919]  In the United States, you can choose to do it or not to do it.
[03:56:03.919 --> 03:56:04.960]  It's your choice.
[03:56:04.960 --> 03:56:07.042]  It's not for me to decide.
[03:56:07.042 --> 03:56:09.725]  Except for what we're doing in our house.
[03:56:09.725 --> 03:56:09.865]  But...
[03:56:10.939 --> 03:56:19.261]  Boy oh boy, why in the world would Facebook suggest that you do this with your kids when they know full well all the downsides?
[03:56:19.261 --> 03:56:23.201]  My name is Matt and I am the General Manager of WCKG here in Chicago.
[03:56:23.201 --> 03:56:28.502]  We carry the Alex Jones Show every day, Monday through Friday, David Knight and Real News every morning.

[03:57:27.698 --> 03:57:31.059]  WCKG being a radio station can help.
[03:57:31.059 --> 03:57:32.460]  With your help, we can do it.
