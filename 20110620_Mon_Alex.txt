[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:35.280]  it is nothing short of wild how much incredible news information we have to
[00:35.280 --> 00:44.360]  cover today I don't know where to start the House Committee has passed the bill
[00:44.360 --> 00:50.560]  and now going to the full full Congress to arrest and give you five years in
[00:50.560 --> 00:56.360]  prison if you embed a YouTube video now YouTube has the embed function that's
[00:56.360 --> 01:02.000]  how the internet operates but it says if you embed a video that is later found to
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.560]  be copyright you will be arrested and the Electronic Frontier Foundation others
[01:07.560 --> 01:11.680]  went directly to Congress months ago and said do you know what this does and they
[01:11.680 --> 01:17.680]  said yes we know also the big gold exchange with the forex has come out and
[01:17.680 --> 01:22.200]  said the way new regulations are written the private over-the-counter sale of
[01:22.200 --> 01:27.560]  gold is technically illegal and that they're going to be you know advising
[01:27.560 --> 01:32.280]  everyone to stop the over-the-counter sale of gold all of these incredible
[01:32.280 --> 01:38.520]  things are happening not with a bang but with a whimper and as usual the
[01:38.520 --> 01:47.200]  American people are distracted are diverted by more exercises and political
[01:47.200 --> 01:51.760]  correctness training us to obsess over what people say rather than what people
[01:51.760 --> 01:57.920]  do example Barack Obama impersonator hold off stage at Republican gathering and
[01:57.920 --> 02:02.480]  I've watched the full 20-minute piece he was supposed to do more than 30 and it's
[02:02.480 --> 02:10.680]  really pretty mild bipartisan bashing but they couldn't handle it and they're
[02:10.680 --> 02:15.320]  now calling it a big defeat for Republicans showing their redneck
[02:15.320 --> 02:20.360]  racist because they'd have somebody like this they're speaking and and just
[02:20.360 --> 02:24.840]  just endless obsession over it with political correctness we also see of
[02:24.840 --> 02:33.440]  course MSNBC running a piece airing a national golf championship event and
[02:33.440 --> 02:39.720]  playing a piece they produced with the pledge of allegiance which of course
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.880]  many times is read out at the beginning of sporting events or they engage in the
[02:44.880 --> 02:51.040]  star-spangled banner national anthem with the words under God as well as one
[02:51.040 --> 02:59.640]  nation omitted that's your New World Order type of pledge of allegiance where
[02:59.640 --> 03:03.880]  everybody's focusing on the under God taking out what about one nation we can
[03:03.880 --> 03:09.520]  have one nation when you're part of a New World Order so we have that
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.280]  information that we're gonna be breaking down but not breaking it down from the
[03:13.280 --> 03:17.560]  angle that everybody else is looking at it but but to really illustrate how this
[03:17.560 --> 03:25.400]  is an overall distraction a overall diversion from the incredible earth
[03:25.400 --> 03:30.840]  shattering events that are taking place in our world now what I'm gonna do is
[03:30.840 --> 03:33.640]  when we come back from break I'm gonna run over a lot of the different
[03:33.640 --> 03:37.160]  headlines that are here and some of the reports that I think are most important

[04:01.880 --> 04:08.480]  expose the paradigm and then overturn the neo-fascistic modern model of high-tech
[04:08.480 --> 04:12.960]  slavery we will take your phone calls throughout the broadcast today but in

[06:03.520 --> 06:07.480]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[06:07.480 --> 06:11.720]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:11.720 --> 06:16.000]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:16.000 --> 06:20.360]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.360 --> 06:24.440]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.440 --> 06:29.000]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.120]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.120 --> 06:37.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.120 --> 06:40.920]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:40.920 --> 06:43.640]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[09:19.680 --> 09:25.080]  you a summary of here in a moment the toll-free number to join us if your
[09:25.080 --> 09:33.320]  first-time callers here in the first hour 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 will
[09:33.320 --> 09:41.040]  get you up and on the air we're to start here Bilderberg approved Perry set to
[09:41.040 --> 09:45.560]  become presidential front-runner of course he pledged not run for
[09:45.560 --> 09:50.360]  president just months ago he had the presidential book out to fat up he's
[09:50.360 --> 09:56.320]  been making all the national rounds he'd been hiring all the staff you've got
[09:56.320 --> 10:01.560]  Gendrich's people leaving to run to him and no one will call him a liar when he
[10:01.560 --> 10:06.520]  announces for president they'll go oh he's lying to us this is good now he's
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.840]  presidential caliber so later in the hour I want to really look at who Rick
[10:11.840 --> 10:18.360]  Perry is the forced inoculations of a vaccine that was a live cancer virus
[10:18.360 --> 10:22.720]  known to kill people in the trials and a lot of people died after it happened he
[10:22.720 --> 10:26.280]  ran the hoax saying it was the law to take it that was a lie within a side a
[10:26.280 --> 10:30.680]  lie it wasn't the law he repeatedly vetoed the state and tried to ram through
[10:30.680 --> 10:35.600]  the NAFTA superhighways in Texas to turn over 8,000 miles of already paid for
[10:35.600 --> 10:40.240]  roads which is illegal by the way federally in the state level to offshore
[10:40.240 --> 10:46.760]  corporations like Centra of Spain and Zachary of Australia the list really goes
[10:46.760 --> 10:51.040]  on and on under his tutelage in ten years as governor he gave us the
[10:51.040 --> 10:55.840]  franchise tax which is an income tax on businesses he gave us the hospital
[10:55.840 --> 11:00.800]  district taxes but he says openly in speeches that a prophet's not known in
[11:00.800 --> 11:03.680]  his own country that's why a lot of conservatives don't like him here in
[11:03.680 --> 11:08.320]  Texas they actually know who he is what he only won about 31 32% of the vote in
[11:08.320 --> 11:12.520]  a three-way race if I think he can only win in three-way races that's how they
[11:12.520 --> 11:19.920]  fix things here in Texas for him actually says look at how good Texas is
[11:19.920 --> 11:25.920]  doing look at how good it is with me as governor Texas is doing good despite
[11:25.920 --> 11:30.520]  Rick Perry I get these emails and calls and occasionally people on the street
[11:30.520 --> 11:35.520]  walk up and go you know you got it good you know America's good Alex quit
[11:35.520 --> 11:38.840]  criticizing the government they're going to protect us they're not going to let
[11:38.840 --> 11:43.920]  World War three happen they're good these people believe that government makes
[11:43.920 --> 11:50.120]  the grass grow that government makes the sunshine the birds sing that they make
[11:50.120 --> 11:56.520]  the baby fawns be born the baby deer you know in the springtime and what a what
[11:56.520 --> 12:04.760]  a fundamentally unconstitutional anti-1776 anti-conservative statement by
[12:04.760 --> 12:11.040]  Rick Perry that he has made Texas great oh yeah no it's just that the rest of the
[12:11.040 --> 12:16.200]  country is going down the toilet bowl faster and Rick Perry is one of the
[12:16.200 --> 12:22.200]  chunks of detritus out towards the edge you know he's trying as best he can to
[12:22.200 --> 12:30.440]  get down into that sewer and so yes in the depression nationwide Texas because
[12:30.440 --> 12:37.920]  it has per capita the smallest government except maybe Montana you can
[12:37.920 --> 12:41.960]  look at the statistics and debate that is doing better and Rick Perry says it's
[12:41.960 --> 12:49.480]  because of him see I'm already getting into Rick Perry but boy we did call it in
[12:49.480 --> 12:54.280]  my film now three and a half years ago it came out in 2007 so three and a half
[12:54.280 --> 12:59.040]  years ago that even longer than three and a half years ago it's almost four
[12:59.040 --> 13:03.000]  years ago in-game blueprint for global enslavement what a seminal documentary
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.000]  the film ends with Rick Perry just like Obama deception has Obama and Hillary
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.200]  secretly meeting at a Bilderberg group meeting in Virginia and the whole
[13:14.200 --> 13:20.000]  national media is the number one story that day was where is Obama he's
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.120]  disappeared he told the press corps to get on an airplane in Chicago they slammed
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.720]  the door shut they protested and they locked him on board actual kidnapping
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.280]  Shanghai and flew them to Chicago and Gibbs the of the the the a feat Gibbs
[13:34.280 --> 13:39.280]  I said that well there was a there was a desire to have some private meetings and
[13:39.280 --> 13:44.160]  so Obama slipped off yeah from the Dallas airport he acted like he got on the
[13:44.160 --> 13:48.280]  plane and then got back in the motorcade with a secret service with Hillary and
[13:48.280 --> 13:55.200]  drove into the Chantilly Marriott we're there we we document they go on with a
[13:55.200 --> 13:58.640]  secret service we call the national media who claims they're running around
[13:58.640 --> 14:04.400]  looking for Obama for more than a day and no one shows up see that that little
[14:04.400 --> 14:07.600]  story the reason I've told it many times is that and it covered it's covered in
[14:07.600 --> 14:12.840]  Obama deception shows that the Bilderberg group is dominating our planet to a
[14:12.840 --> 14:16.680]  great extent and trying to fully dominate it you don't have a total world
[14:16.680 --> 14:20.600]  government yet they're not all powerful yet they're trying though and as long as
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.800]  we live in denial and won't even admit that powerful groups powerful combines
[14:24.800 --> 14:28.920]  of corporations and government get together to expand their power I mean if
[14:28.920 --> 14:32.720]  we really have been taught as a nation and as a world that that doesn't exist
[14:32.720 --> 14:38.080]  when common sense through all of history shows that is a fact that's why we're so
[14:38.080 --> 14:45.280]  enslaved if you had to pick one thing it's this idea that denial is somehow a
[14:45.280 --> 14:52.360]  great virtue and that just just telling yourself oh there's no powerful people
[14:52.360 --> 14:55.760]  that want to eat my lunch oh there's no powerful interest that have got to be
[14:55.760 --> 15:03.240]  kept under control the minute you have a mindset like that it's over and and and
[15:03.240 --> 15:09.280]  our so-called mainstream media the corporate dying dinosaur whore media is
[15:09.280 --> 15:17.320]  is so pathetic that that night and that next day we called all the TV stations
[15:17.320 --> 15:22.960]  and got on radio and told people to call the TV stations and in newspapers and
[15:22.960 --> 15:29.560]  no one showed up to cover it there's Obama there's Hillary meeting secret
[15:29.560 --> 15:33.920]  no one knows where they are top story in the country you're calling them telling
[15:33.920 --> 15:39.280]  them where they are and they don't care they don't want to know that's why the
[15:39.280 --> 15:47.120]  drudge report has more readers than the New York Times that's why info wars
[15:47.120 --> 15:51.360]  calm and present planet calm are exploding and rising that's why every
[15:51.360 --> 16:00.280]  other outlet that that will cover stories like that is on fire and those
[16:00.280 --> 16:05.320]  that won't cover it are imploding into the dustbin of history but they're not
[16:05.320 --> 16:08.800]  going to stop there I've got a flotilla of news articles globally and
[16:08.800 --> 16:11.840]  domestically where governments are openly saying they want to censor the
[16:11.840 --> 16:17.880]  internet talk radio it's happening their tyranny cannot stand if we have a
[16:17.880 --> 16:22.120]  voice to respond to it and that's why folks need to realize how precious this
[16:22.120 --> 16:31.120]  radio broadcast is how in a sea of lies it is standing out and in shining like a
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.080]  light on a hill in the gathering darkness and and that's why it's so
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.960]  important now more than ever to spread the word about info wars calm present
[16:40.960 --> 16:46.680]  planet calm we're being taught to be a nation of ninnies that obsess over
[16:46.680 --> 16:51.880]  political correctness and who sit down and shut up and don't talk about
[16:51.880 --> 16:56.040]  politics and religion America was founded on talking about politics and
[16:56.040 --> 17:00.520]  religion and getting angry at tyranny all of the blessings we have all the
[17:00.520 --> 17:04.160]  good things we have don't come from Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or Rick
[17:04.160 --> 17:09.000]  Perry or Al Gore even though they tell us that the internet comes from Al
[17:09.000 --> 17:17.320]  Gore the blessings all the good things we have is because we did have forefathers
[17:17.320 --> 17:21.520]  and and forebearers who were obsessed with private property obsessed with the
[17:21.520 --> 17:25.840]  Second Amendment obsessed with liberty and fearful and angry at government and
[17:25.840 --> 17:33.680]  mistrustful of power and we collectively enshrined the idea of the
[17:33.680 --> 17:39.400]  individual as being the ultimate goal the individual being empowered and
[17:39.400 --> 17:45.160]  turned loose to follow their dreams so we individually collectivize the system
[17:45.160 --> 17:55.040]  to protect our individual freedoms and so people that say oh it's extreme it's
[17:55.040 --> 18:01.280]  bizarre to be upset about corruption or even say corruption exist you people
[18:01.280 --> 18:04.760]  are going to ruin it for everybody it's the opposite those of you that go along
[18:04.760 --> 18:09.480]  to get along those of you that think compromise is a good thing well the
[18:09.480 --> 18:13.480]  other side isn't compromising so this isn't compromise you can't compromise
[18:13.480 --> 18:20.840]  on bedrock principles you can't compromise that government corruption is
[18:20.840 --> 18:24.920]  dangerous and will grow out of control if not faced history shows that a hundred
[18:24.920 --> 18:29.600]  percent you can't compromise with the fact that when a government tries to

[24:14.720 --> 24:21.440]  and it is also linked to down the left-hand side of the drudge report under
[24:21.440 --> 24:28.440]  the other headlines Rick Perry fires up crowds the different Christian
[24:28.440 --> 24:32.960]  conservative groups he's speaking before and Perry said stand up and stop
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.520]  apologizing for your conservatism well I agree real conservatives
[24:37.520 --> 24:42.800]  constitutionalist should stand up to Perry and say hey why'd you pass all
[24:42.800 --> 24:47.000]  these new tax systems in Texas why are you for forced Gardasil inoculations
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.320]  why were you for the North American Union funding trans Texas NAFTA super
[24:52.320 --> 24:58.960]  highway leg why did you go to Bilderberg in 2007 and as you can see
[24:58.960 --> 25:04.080]  there on the drudge report he's linked to our article I tell you drudge is
[25:04.080 --> 25:11.560]  really really causing a stir with this the fact that he'll he exposes
[25:11.560 --> 25:15.520]  Democrats going to Bilderberg is a big deal that's when he really started
[25:15.520 --> 25:22.200]  covering it was when Obama went in 2008 but now that he's covering Perry it's
[25:22.200 --> 25:27.560]  pretty hardcore but again drudge has this report up there Bilderberg approved
[25:27.560 --> 25:33.800]  Perry set to become presidential frontrunner Paul Joseph Watson's article
[25:33.800 --> 25:39.200]  today and as I said we're gonna be breaking that down more look I wish
[25:39.200 --> 25:46.160]  Perry was real I wish that Rick Perry was a Ron Paul type who could really be
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.480]  trusted and that's what Ron Paul has said Ron Paul 75 believe me he had to
[25:50.480 --> 25:53.900]  have his arm twisted to run but regardless of what happens in this
[25:53.900 --> 25:58.040]  election he'll inject real issues he will show the alternative of true
[25:58.040 --> 26:04.280]  liberty and constitutional views versus rhinos Republican in name only and
[26:04.280 --> 26:11.120]  Rick Perry may wear cowboy hats and talk about secession and claim that he killed
[26:11.120 --> 26:15.680]  a coyote in Westlake Hills which is you know the suburb of Austin while he was
[26:15.680 --> 26:21.580]  jogging I mean he made tell us that you know he fought and killed Yosemite
[26:21.580 --> 26:30.120]  Sam and and you know next that he rides with with tanto but the facts are Rick
[26:30.120 --> 26:33.760]  Perry is not who he says he is and you could say well forget the forced
[26:33.760 --> 26:39.160]  inoculations forget the the the UN take over the highways by foreign
[26:39.160 --> 26:44.760]  companies forget all that okay well let's just forget it I don't make a lot
[26:44.760 --> 26:48.360]  of mistakes and generally when I do it's because I go with mainstream media I
[26:48.360 --> 26:51.760]  heard local news talk radio in the news segment last week announced that Perry
[26:51.760 --> 26:55.840]  had added it to the special session and I searched it and couldn't find it but
[26:55.840 --> 26:58.800]  thought well they they must have just gotten the news well I went and looked
[26:58.800 --> 27:03.800]  it up he's never added it and now you've got the Washington Times and Lou
[27:03.800 --> 27:07.480]  Rockwell and everybody else literally over a hundred articles begging him
[27:07.480 --> 27:12.960]  headlines Rick Perry's our only hope on TSA please Rick added a special session
[27:12.960 --> 27:16.960]  the house says they have the votes to pass it the Senate has the votes near
[27:16.960 --> 27:22.080]  unanimous in both if you'll just get behind it we can stop the TSA sticking
[27:22.080 --> 27:26.440]  their hands down people's pants and by the way it's now come out TSA admitted
[27:26.440 --> 27:31.200]  in New Orleans they called a male and female members of the legislature out
[27:31.200 --> 27:36.200]  to single them out the TSA did and squeeze I played the clip yesterday from
[27:36.200 --> 27:42.560]  Fox News local squeeze the man's genitals so hard it it racked him you know
[27:42.560 --> 27:45.320]  that's how God designed this you're not supposed to damage those you can have
[27:45.320 --> 27:50.480]  children so you know pressure hurts them well they just said and he said you're
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.000]  trying to punch me and they said you bet we are then they went on to search his
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.800]  bags for 40 plus minutes I mean pretty soon they're gonna get a meat cleaver
[27:58.800 --> 28:02.560]  out and say get it on the wooden table got to make sure there's not bombs in
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.600]  there and you think I'm joking they're talking about full chest x-rays to stop
[28:06.600 --> 28:11.560]  al-qaeda breast implant bombs or to x-ray dogs that get on planes because al-
[28:11.560 --> 28:16.720]  ciata might try I mean the government's got to take all rights away because the
[28:16.720 --> 28:20.360]  terrorists might strike you could never stop terrorists from striking even if
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.160]  you believe this whole fable they're sacrificing our republic in the name of
[28:25.160 --> 28:30.000]  liberty when you know the private interests that run this country are not
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.480]  free market and are open tyrants in their own admissions but imagine he's
[28:34.480 --> 28:37.760]  like you're hurting me I played the newscaster like he's like is this
[28:37.760 --> 28:43.960]  punishment they go yes it is I mean but I mean now they just you see they're
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.800]  getting prison guard types who are used to dealing with prisoners a lot of which
[28:48.800 --> 28:52.920]  are innocent biggest prison population in the world mass frame ups but a lot of
[28:52.920 --> 28:56.600]  them are guilty and of course it's come out they released the violent offenders
[28:56.600 --> 29:00.080]  to menace the population of the country while keeping the nonviolent they're
[29:00.080 --> 29:04.680]  better widget makers making defense contractor parts they don't just make

[34:50.520 --> 34:54.560]  country down after another we have the internal IMF World Bank documents from
[34:54.560 --> 34:59.080]  nine years ago 2002 that we should rewrite about that because you know what
[34:59.080 --> 35:03.240]  we tend to think just because we covered something six seven years ago five
[35:03.240 --> 35:07.880]  years ago two years ago that people know we should write about that continuing
[35:07.880 --> 35:14.640]  we've got just just incredible police state news and and I I tend to not
[35:14.640 --> 35:21.840]  cover news that we're in because I quite frankly find myself boring I mean it's
[35:21.840 --> 35:25.520]  exciting if I see some big national news story at first and then I read it and
[35:25.520 --> 35:30.080]  it's it's it's passé I'm more excited about what's happening outside of you
[35:30.080 --> 35:34.000]  know news reports on yours truly or things that are happening to us but I
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.480]  have to remember what's happening to yours truly is happening to everybody else
[35:37.480 --> 35:42.840]  as well and I got in here a little bit earlier this morning and meant to shoot
[35:42.840 --> 35:46.480]  a special video report about it but then got sidetracked with some other things
[35:46.480 --> 35:50.360]  going on because I want to illustrate this for people so they know how serious
[35:50.360 --> 35:59.320]  it is video exposing Google chief Schmidt censored by YouTube but then the
[35:59.320 --> 36:06.680]  second part of that is that they've removed for the second time a video we
[36:06.680 --> 36:10.120]  put out and I've got a clip of it I'm gonna try to play part of it later it's
[36:10.120 --> 36:17.120]  a nine minute video where I announced the Obama Joker operation in 2009 and
[36:17.120 --> 36:20.360]  they were still saying he was God and the Christ and literally calling him the
[36:20.360 --> 36:26.560]  Christ in the news and he was like Jesus and he would save us and I took the
[36:26.560 --> 36:33.080]  Obama Joker poster that reportedly somebody in California first hung up we
[36:33.080 --> 36:36.480]  altered it a bit put out our version because they were calling for the
[36:36.480 --> 36:41.400]  person's arrest and saying it was racist and it's not racist to put down
[36:41.400 --> 36:48.400]  Napoleon Bonaparte or George W. Bush or Barack Obama and in the national news
[36:48.400 --> 36:53.040]  then after I did that put out pieces saying we were racist and that to show
[36:53.040 --> 36:57.880]  him as a Joker we're saying he's a criminal I mean what have we showed him
[36:57.880 --> 37:02.880]  his two-faced what have we showed him as bizarro I mean the point is he's a bad
[37:02.880 --> 37:06.680]  guy and and then they had people on the local news national news saying it's
[37:06.680 --> 37:13.120]  horrible it's racist it's evil that they're putting these up and they know
[37:13.120 --> 37:17.400]  full well it's not racist it's a political weapon just like the talking
[37:17.400 --> 37:21.560]  porn MSNBC for a year was if you don't support government-run healthcare
[37:21.560 --> 37:28.200]  you're a racist you don't like black people I mean remember Carlos Watson and
[37:28.200 --> 37:31.840]  slimeball Matthews saying that they know full well that's a cold-blooded
[37:31.840 --> 37:37.880]  political tactic they're using well Google gave us a strike removed it and
[37:37.880 --> 37:42.640]  said that we would be taken down if we had one more and we posted those letters
[37:42.640 --> 37:47.200]  and what they told us and and people say well YouTube's a private thing so the
[37:47.200 --> 37:52.480]  point is I followed their rules okay they have an open marketplace it's YouTube
[37:52.480 --> 37:56.800]  it's our content your content that made them great Google bought out the small
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.080]  company out of San Francisco they claim that there's this terms of service
[38:01.080 --> 38:04.880]  they're violating their terms of service they're involved in unfair trade
[38:04.880 --> 38:11.080]  practices they make money off of us and then we put a video up exposing the
[38:11.080 --> 38:15.760]  chairman of Google Eric Schmidt at Bilderberg and it's the number one video
[38:15.760 --> 38:19.680]  on YouTube and they just delisted and take our honors away again I don't care
[38:19.680 --> 38:23.400]  about having an honor because I want to have a trophy like I won the race the
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.280]  honors is what puts it at the top of all the pages hey this is the top video
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.000]  here it is it's the top video in this section the top video in that section
[38:32.000 --> 38:36.680]  it was a top video in many different sections education news and politics
[38:36.680 --> 38:44.200]  they just took it out because there's the head of Google and now we have
[38:44.200 --> 38:47.240]  Lieberman saying he wants to control the now we have YouTube last month a
[38:47.240 --> 38:51.960]  racing political demonstration videos quote under government request a new
[38:51.960 --> 38:57.440]  message government requested removal we wrote articles about that I mean this
[38:57.440 --> 39:04.800]  is incredible this is incredible but the issue is they remove the video and and
[39:04.800 --> 39:11.960]  said because of racism which is a form of slander defamation truth is the total
[39:11.960 --> 39:17.280]  defense well it's not true you go watch the video and I say the media is saying
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.880]  it's racist in LA that somebody's putting up these things as Obama as a
[39:21.880 --> 39:26.240]  joker and saying socialist clearly they're saying he's a criminal and that
[39:26.240 --> 39:30.640]  socialism is a thing that's villainous i.e. the Joker I said well because
[39:30.640 --> 39:33.800]  they're calling for this poor guy's arrest or gal we don't still know
[39:33.800 --> 39:38.240]  exactly who it is that's it we're going nationwide it went nationwide hundreds
[39:38.240 --> 39:42.960]  of newspapers literally hundreds of local TV scores of national TV Japanese
[39:42.960 --> 39:48.280]  TV German TV Dutch British Brazilian it was one of the biggest things we ever
[39:48.280 --> 39:55.040]  did and Google removed our video I went and filed with Google and said I'm
[39:55.040 --> 39:58.920]  challenging this well they shut down the whole account because when you
[39:58.920 --> 40:03.800]  challenge one of their rulings not a copyright claim that's outside you're
[40:03.800 --> 40:08.160]  allowed they said you are now in status of being shut down your account is
[40:08.160 --> 40:12.960]  locked down couldn't upload videos you could watch our videos but our account
[40:12.960 --> 40:16.640]  was shut down and they told us they said if you do it again we're gonna get
[40:16.640 --> 40:20.520]  rid of your channel now it had back then 50 million views and we got a lot of
[40:20.520 --> 40:25.280]  channels over 300 million total now in the last three years but it's now 117
[40:25.280 --> 40:31.600]  million views on that channel 117 million Russia today has 5 million ABC news
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.960]  40 something million we're one of the biggest news channels in the world in
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.600]  fact the biggest on YouTube on that one channel 117 million views do we get
[40:40.600 --> 40:47.480]  any respect we get no you're a racist and if you challenge us we're gonna shut
[40:47.480 --> 40:52.200]  you down now what did the video say just that I'd cover this later I'm just
[40:52.200 --> 40:57.160]  covering it now what did the video say video said they're saying somebody's
[40:57.160 --> 41:00.320]  racist for hanging these signs we're gonna have a national movement to hang
[41:00.320 --> 41:04.200]  them has nothing to do with race just like everybody showed Bush as a vampire
[41:04.200 --> 41:08.360]  and as a joker whether it's true or not whether you agree with that or not it's
[41:08.360 --> 41:13.680]  your political right to do that and so under the First Amendment we're going
[41:13.680 --> 41:17.680]  to do this and we did it and people called for our arrest and they had people
[41:17.680 --> 41:21.160]  on TV saying it's disrespectful they need to be arrested we have clips of those
[41:21.160 --> 41:25.560]  newscasts want to make a video about it and so we come out and say that is not
[41:25.560 --> 41:30.880]  racist to call Obama a joker he's a president he's open he's a public figure
[41:30.880 --> 41:41.680]  as public as it gets to ridicule and Google said no so Google's told us they
[41:41.680 --> 41:46.280]  may just shut the channel down that's being decided right now but it's got
[41:46.280 --> 41:50.120]  the strike against it and they say if we challenge it they will lock the channel
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.160]  down again and I'm gonna challenge it and then and then here's the deal you
[41:54.160 --> 41:59.560]  may be a big government funded with NSA openly giving you the money in CIA and
[41:59.560 --> 42:04.840]  you may be at the NASA base and you may be at the DARPA facilities it's all in
[42:04.840 --> 42:09.200]  record it's government run but I I'm putting Eric Schmidt and all you on
[42:09.200 --> 42:14.360]  notice you have operated this is a public commons you we have followed your
[42:14.360 --> 42:20.560]  rules and you're engaged in unfair trade practices in slander and libel and go

[42:26.400 --> 42:29.280]  gonna come after you politically we're gonna have a nationwide movement where
[42:29.280 --> 42:35.160]  every day I call for people to post signs saying beware Google Google spies
[42:35.160 --> 42:41.240]  on you Google kills freedom okay you want to fight you Bilderberg trash you're
[42:41.240 --> 42:45.320]  gonna get one you know they've said we are gonna be the web no headlines seeing
[42:45.320 --> 42:50.160]  in Google wants to run your house the smart meters the smartphones the
[42:50.160 --> 42:54.240]  surveillance the the Apple systems which Schmidt formerly is one of the head
[42:54.240 --> 43:00.320]  people at Apple controlling what you can videotape this is the technocracy so
[43:00.320 --> 43:04.920]  people say why don't you just leave Google and and and YouTube that's where
[43:04.920 --> 43:09.320]  the fight is that's where the war is that's for more than half the videos in

[45:08.360 --> 45:12.600]  censor us they have to the system must do it because we're doing real
[45:12.600 --> 45:17.320]  reportage we're breaking through we're having a huge effect and if the system
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.720]  can silence us they can then set me up put me in prison or worse okay so it's a
[45:22.720 --> 45:26.840]  life-or-death situation decide if you're for free speech or against it are you

[55:07.640 --> 55:15.080]  just means a multi-regional long-term war with large powers involved over a

[55:45.120 --> 55:48.640]  on a whole i made a list of things i called last week and my wife ordered
[55:48.640 --> 55:52.080]  me cow been soaked so we're supported last night for father's day she couldn't
[55:52.080 --> 55:56.080]  think of what to get thank you i got you know one of the things that you talk
[55:56.080 --> 56:00.640]  about i just woke up and turned on the probably a few months ago but i have a
[56:00.640 --> 56:05.600]  2004 bmw m3 that i was driving that is a few years ago down the road don't have
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.400]  a phone in it back in 04 you either put a phone in it or you didn't and i'm
[56:10.400 --> 56:13.720]  driving down with the radio on top down and all of a sudden the phone starts
[56:13.720 --> 56:16.760]  ringing in my car and i don't have a phone in my car so i asked the lady what
[56:16.760 --> 56:20.360]  number she called called my wife up ask my wife to call me sure enough it came
[56:20.360 --> 56:25.800]  through over my car stereo which i don't know how it happened but somehow that
[56:25.800 --> 56:32.120]  car's wired and no all the cars in china most the cars in japan and now most the
[56:32.120 --> 56:38.440]  new cars in the u.s. have boxes built into them that have a computer and a
[56:38.440 --> 56:44.040]  wireless cell phone chip and microphone that's why you can buy a track phone for
[56:44.040 --> 56:49.120]  less than ten dollars and because the components are so cheap and so yes they're
[56:49.120 --> 56:54.080]  putting spy devices i just covered that last week was in the epoch times people
[56:54.080 --> 56:56.600]  kept wondering how the police knew everything they were talking about in
[56:56.600 --> 57:02.640]  china and it's because the toll road boxes that that you know the you know the
[57:02.640 --> 57:07.520]  size of a matchbox that everybody's given in china and Hong Kong for the toll
[57:07.520 --> 57:11.440]  roads also happen to have a microphone and people said well how are they
[57:11.440 --> 57:16.080]  listening that would take millions of police and spies no they have computers
[57:16.080 --> 57:21.560]  listening to what you say and that flags it off keywords of it's it's an audio
[57:21.560 --> 57:29.240]  google system slash nsa system and so yes the smart meters all under global
[57:29.240 --> 57:37.440]  regulations all of the new this is all of the world new appliances have plugs
[57:37.440 --> 57:43.280]  that have digital chip systems in them where the electricity to your device not
[57:43.280 --> 57:49.520]  wireless not no no no the the the electricity itself can have government
[57:49.520 --> 57:55.360]  data sent to it and then the and then the washing machine dishwasher computer it
[57:55.360 --> 57:59.280]  then surveils you and of course if that isn't good enough they have now by law
[57:59.280 --> 58:02.840]  globally the new curly queue light bulbs why are those standardized that's
[58:02.840 --> 58:06.720]  certain type of fluorescent and they're outlawing the phosphorescent phasing it
[58:06.720 --> 58:10.920]  out because that then with the new infrared systems coming out on most of
[58:10.920 --> 58:15.920]  the new keyboards or computer screens it accesses and hacks your computer with
[58:15.920 --> 58:23.760]  with a blurb flash orders from the light bulbs so that's all part of freedom
[58:23.760 --> 58:27.440]  though of course and Tom Tom's tracking you as well did you have anything else
[58:27.440 --> 58:30.840]  you wanted to add things that I want to mention my daughter stay there back in
[58:30.840 --> 58:35.680]  one minute then we're going to you we're going to Tim then Trey Matt Jean Steve
[58:35.680 --> 58:38.800]  everybody else we'll be right back again I'm an extremist because I don't like

[58:55.680 --> 58:59.640]  with yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[58:59.640 --> 59:02.800]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to

[59:20.120 --> 59:25.000]  deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas this includes the
[59:25.000 --> 59:31.600]  eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system

[1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.200 --> 1:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:29.680]  Alex Jones coming up later in the hour Barack Obama's White House rural
[1:00:29.680 --> 1:00:35.040]  council we have a tin governor council now well now he has a central economic
[1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:40.120]  planning for America's heartland what he calls the bitter clingers that's gonna
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:46.240]  be coming up an expose Rick Perry right now let's go back to Tim in Florida Tim
[1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:50.320]  what was the next point you wanted to make what you mentioned YouTube earlier
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:53.720]  and they're passing this new offer this five-year imprisonment thing if you do
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:56.800]  a copyright I don't have a YouTube account now just because of reasons of
[1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:00.200]  like that when you said people took down sites because they said they had porn
[1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:03.760]  on them but average you know they didn't but they did they took them down and if
[1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:06.720]  if you have an account I mean I think that's the way that they can hold you
[1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:10.480]  accountable it was thick what's to keep them from posting something on your
[1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:14.680]  account listen we can't let the intimidation get to us it's not YouTube
[1:01:14.680 --> 1:01:20.000]  doing this particular thing yeah and Tech Dirt and other you know really
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  accurate incredible groups that have have done the breakdown in the last six
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:29.320]  months they have a piece of legislation that's now gone out of committee where
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:34.840]  if you embed a YouTube video it's five years in prison when when YouTube and
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:39.080]  every other video site wants you to embed and the person that posts the video
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:45.320]  can either have it where it's embed enabled or not embed enabled so you
[1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:50.840]  then embed a Fox News video or a Russia Today video even though it's their
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:54.680]  official YouTube and they allow you to embed they give you the code they want
[1:01:54.680 --> 1:02:01.360]  you to the Tech Dirt and the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in
[1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:06.000]  the last six months and they break all this down in the report they went in the
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:09.680]  lobby to the feds and said now listen you're like Senator Ted Stevens who
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:14.680]  thinks the internet's a bunch of tubes and you know that things get clogged up
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:19.760]  that's not how it works you need to change the language of this and they
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:25.320]  said we know that's the language and so that's what they're doing here it is
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:30.320]  senators unconcerned about massive consequences of criminalizing embedding
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:34.400]  YouTube videos this is really no surprise but the same Senate Judiciary
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:39.200]  Committee that unanimously approved the Patriot Act IP Act despite worries from
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:43.720]  internet experts and major media about how it would break the internet has now
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:48.040]  almost unanimously approved the anti-internet streaming bill which makes
[1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:51.400]  it a felony to stream certain videos online potentially putting people in
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:55.360]  jail for embedding YouTube videos are just putting up YouTube lip-syncing
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:58.800]  videos what's really troubling here is the media and plenty of concerned
[1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:02.360]  citizens have directly raised the issue about the unintended consequences of this
[1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:09.320]  law and while senator Amy I can't pronounce her name Chloe Bacher and John
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:12.960]  Cornyn and Christopher Coons continue to insist that of course the law is not
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:16.120]  intended to be used against such people just like the Patriot Act wasn't for
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:19.600]  non-terror related was written for the American people folks not for terrorists
[1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:23.720]  they have made no move to fix the bill even supporters of the bill who insists
[1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:28.120]  that they were wrong about what the bill allowed eventually conceded that our
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:32.000]  argument was accurate and that the bill could be used to put people in jail for
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:36.960]  embedding a YouTube video or doing a lip-sync joke video and it goes this is
[1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:41.160]  a huge huge problem of course it's not a huge problem the systems doing this on
[1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:46.240]  purpose and there's Kurt Nemo's article about the Tech Dirt Report and he has
[1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:51.040]  links to it all embedding YouTube videos may soon be a felony and will put
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:54.880]  that back up I want to read a quote from that it says the owner and others
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:04:00.720]  associated with the website could face up to five years in prison and this is
[1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:04.400]  just an attempt I mean they're gonna try all this just like they tried to say
[1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:07.080]  black people weren't humans and folks had to fight back against it
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:11.160]  tyrants as George Washington said the limit of tyranny you will live under is
[1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:15.920]  the exact level you put up with anything else Tim and a couple months ago you
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:18.480]  covered the school in Texas that got two million dollar grant from the
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:22.840]  government I'm curious is that the same school that they're videotaping the kids
[1:04:22.840 --> 1:04:25.480]  and they're not allowed to bring the lunch because if it is I mean that's
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:29.000]  like a lab rat scenario they're gonna give them different types of food see
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  what are what but no that's exactly no it's in Chicago school districts saying
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:37.920]  parents you can't be trusted your kids belong to us they actually basically said
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:41.240]  that yeah one of the head superintendents said you can't be trusted
[1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:43.720]  they're not allowed to pack lunches for their kids because they're just
[1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:48.920]  biological androids produced more slaves for the system it was a San Antonio
[1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:54.320]  elementary Pentagon two million dollar grant to watch the kids as they eat with
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:59.440]  AI cameras to track them yes we'll be right back with more calls stay with
[1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:03.640]  us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:08.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:12.160]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:16.200]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:20.080]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:24.360]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:28.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:32.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every

[1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:24.320]  by the way I covered the report that's all over the technology papers including
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:30.400]  even CNN senators unconcerned about massive consequences of criminalizing
[1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:36.600]  embedding YouTube videos five years in prison even though the YouTube wants you
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:42.320]  to embed them this is the essence of tyranny is it makes all normal non
[1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:46.880]  criminal activity criminal so they can then selectively enforce on whoever they
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:51.160]  want then they train the entire population of the country that's under
[1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:55.480]  tyranny to live like prisoners and that's and then you get little Soviet
[1:08:55.480 --> 1:09:00.360]  minders on every street corner and the the whole spy society tyranny is a lot
[1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:05.040]  more common than even quasi-free societies so we know exactly what this
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:10.600]  looks like and I've got another report here and this was put out by the big
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:15.840]  gold exchange the forex trading of over-the-counter gold and silver to be
[1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:23.760]  illegal beginning July 15th little-known new government regulation and forex is
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:28.720]  saying they are discontinuing trading for US residents on Friday July 15th
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:32.520]  2011 this is how they're gonna kill the gold and silver market it won't work
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:36.280]  because it's gonna explode worldwide and we're gonna be breaking that down a
[1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:41.120]  little bit later in the hour and it dovetails with this report gold rises
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:48.280]  to new record in GDP close to near record highs in euros and most currencies
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:53.200]  on gold debt contagion risk so they try to knock down gold and silver but
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:57.160]  they're just racing back up and so the federal government has announced very
[1:09:57.160 --> 1:10:03.760]  quietly that it will be illegal to privately sell and trade gold over the
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:08.000]  counter now now again this isn't being announced because they wanted to just go
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:16.040]  into place but that's why in fact reprint me from two months ago the Von
[1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:20.480]  no-tow's report ahead I believe the AP headline was you can also print me the
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:30.660]  FBI press release head of Liberty dollar convicted and and then in the
[1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:35.000]  article they had quotes from the US Attorney saying this is an act of
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.440]  terrorism anyone that tries to create an alternate currency or that basically
[1:10:39.440 --> 1:10:43.640]  has gold and silver is an enemy of America will be infiltrated will be
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:47.680]  destroyed will be overthrown I mean it literally said that your enemies were
[1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:51.760]  going to get you yeah because America's run by the big mega banks that have
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:55.600]  devalued the dollar that have killed the country and they're saying if you
[1:10:55.600 --> 1:10:59.480]  try to create alternate systems so you can survive we're not going to let you
[1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:05.260]  we're here to bankrupt you we're here to run you to ground meanwhile all over
[1:11:05.260 --> 1:11:08.120]  Europe the people are rebelling and the globalists are not going to get away
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:11.600]  with this but here it is trading of over the counter gold and silver to be
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:18.200]  illegal beginning July 15th I will see they're actually able to try to implement
[1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:23.960]  this but there it is Reuters Liberty dollar architect Bernard Von no-tow's
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:28.960]  convicted they called him a special type of terrorist Reuters man convicted of
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:33.440]  creating counterfeit US currency and then we'll also get the FBI press release
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:38.040]  because I people won't believe this I need to you can link directly through to
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:43.240]  the FBI where they say it is terrorism and that they're going to get you yes
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:48.760]  they are they're gonna get you good and if you're the head of the Texas Power
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:52.800]  Commission or a member of the state rep on a trip to Louisiana and they find
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:56.960]  out you're with the Texas delegation get over here it's punishment time they
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:01.040]  walk right over put the blue gloves on and say get ready for this and they
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:05.840]  grab your genitals and they crush them and then the state officials said are
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:09.840]  you punishing me and they said you bet your bottom dollar we are boy this is a
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:16.480]  fed takeover only in America could they take head state officials public
[1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:20.080]  servants and just crush them hey oh you think I'm joking you didn't hear
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:25.880]  yesterday's show I have local Fox News with the interviews this is how far it's
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:32.000]  gone this is how crazy they just gave a woman five years probation for lightly
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:36.680]  spanking your child in Corpus Christi Texas while the state paddles kids and
[1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:40.880]  all the major public schools it's not illegal to spank your kids they don't
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:45.240]  care because they're tyrants it's getting scarier by the minute it's
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:49.520]  getting crazier and they're just trying to bum rushes to get us used to it
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:55.800]  Trey in South Carolina you're on the air hey Alex I actually had a question for
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:13:00.000]  you about five months ago I watched a documentary called wake up calls the
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:06.320]  New World Order I actually officially got woken up and it's hard to live I
[1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:12.000]  guess what we would other people with society called normal life it's hard to
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:17.120]  live that way whenever you you've been woken up and my question you was in your
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:22.160]  position you've been doing this for so long you've been awake how do you deal
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:26.520]  with it I mean how do you deal with the burden of the knowledge and and getting
[1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:31.000]  out to people and especially when they've been conditioned to not listen to it
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:37.080]  they've been programmed to to turn it off and turn it away my big question is
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:41.240]  how do you penetrate through that illusion well I mean this is a huge
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:45.960]  multifaceted question Trey and I appreciate your call number one you've
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:50.480]  got to be confident in the knowledge a lot of people are apologetic when they
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:53.760]  tell their neighbors oh hey you know there's a corrupt government they act
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:58.080]  real sheepish and the neighbor is insecure and feels powerless as well and
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:03.240]  so they subconsciously then defend the system you know in a kind of make
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:08.760]  believe thing that children do to say hey there's no such thing as bad men
[1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:13.880]  there's no such thing as corruption you're a kook everything's fine it's a
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:18.880]  form of cognitive dissonance denial but more importantly you've got to realize
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:22.680]  it's never a majority that defeats tyranny it's always a highly motivated
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:27.600]  minority just as it's always a highly motivated minority that brings in
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:31.820]  tyranny it's a minority that kicks it out most people are followers so you
[1:14:31.820 --> 1:14:36.120]  want to find leaders and it may be a little old lady it may be a little old
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:40.760]  man maybe a young person a black person an Asian person a Hispanic person a
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:46.080]  white guy it doesn't matter you're gonna find that leadership in your own heart
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:53.640]  and through God's guidance and how do I deal with this my life is incredibly
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:15:00.960]  exciting I'm never bored my problem is I have too much energy I'm totally
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:05.280]  obsessed with reality and the truth and I don't even really have fear anymore
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:11.760]  of my physical body being attacked or even my name being destroyed because I
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:17.000]  realize there's no future for humanity and for our culture if this system is
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:22.600]  not defeated and so by having courage it becomes an example to others and you
[1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:26.640]  find out there are people out there who feel the same way you do and who
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:31.920]  resonate with the truth and liberty and who also instinctively but also
[1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:37.320]  intellectually realize the serious threat that humanity is under via the
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:40.680]  corrupt system known as the New World Order which is just a collection of
[1:15:40.680 --> 1:15:45.920]  criminals that have industrialized and organized and standardized systems of
[1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:55.400]  predatory behavior against the sheep-like cattle-like sheeple but the sheeple
[1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:59.320]  are gonna be the sheeple we need to get the motivated folks that realize what's
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:03.520]  happening to really get motivated and really get aggressive and you will have
[1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:06.480]  big effects you just you've got to realize you're not gonna save the world
[1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:13.000]  by yourself but overall the the act of resistance the act of standing up the
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:18.040]  act of speaking out will bring these tyrants down because mass murderers
[1:16:18.040 --> 1:16:24.200]  agree gun control works well patriots agree liberty works and the truth
[1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:30.920]  sells but when your friends your family giggle and laugh at you they've made a
[1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:33.960]  decision to live in a trance they've made a decision to go along with
[1:16:33.960 --> 1:16:37.920]  corruption they've made a decision to just give up and to just take whatever
[1:16:37.920 --> 1:16:42.720]  comes to them and that's normal when you've had so much wealth that's why in
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:48.600]  extreme liberty historically always grows into decadence sloth and the cycle
[1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:55.400]  restarts and we hopefully can use the examples of history to warn enough people
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:59.800]  that when the tyranny grows we're gonna go through the decadent cycle but it
[1:16:59.800 --> 1:17:06.840]  won't go as deep as it could and as it has in other societies if we're there
[1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:13.320]  raising the alarm and that's what separates great transcendent ideas from
[1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:20.880]  the crowd quality is always a rare thing and so don't let it get you down and
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:24.920]  and and don't become depressed reality was there whether you recognize it or
[1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:30.600]  not so understand how exciting it is I mean you're going toe-to-toe with
[1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:36.880]  corruption with real evil and I think that's exciting I think it's exciting
[1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:40.280]  that I'm under surveillance I think it's exciting that they could kill me or
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:44.900]  set me up at any time I don't look forward to it but if they've got me
[1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:49.720]  chained down torturing me it's gonna be exciting they'll have to drug me under
[1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:54.360]  torture to break my will and that's only for a period of time that that means
[1:17:54.360 --> 1:17:58.120]  I've really had an effect that means I've really did something for humanity
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:03.720]  that means my ancestors have been made proud it means I'm a man like my
[1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:07.320]  father's before me I mean this is what it's all about do you have any idea the
[1:18:07.320 --> 1:18:11.720]  struggle our species has gone through to bring us to this point and the
[1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:21.120]  incredible heights that humanity can reach towards and it's that awareness of
[1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:26.160]  the bestial survival of the fish lower order and that we can reach for the
[1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:30.000]  stars it's it's that mankind is in between that and it's the simple
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:34.920]  recognizing goodness and recognizing what's honorable and what is wholesome
[1:18:34.920 --> 1:18:41.640]  the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 the ability to have basic clear common sense
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:49.960]  thoughts is revolutionary in a system of of overwhelming deceit and so as the
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:53.800]  system gets crazier as it wants you to accept more and more over the top
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:58.920]  corruption and degradation and evil and and as the system sells it as mother's
[1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:05.440]  milk all we've got to do is simply pointed out as a lie and it's something
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:11.560]  that's highly destructive and be willing to be laughed at be willing to be shunned
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:18.160]  be willing I mean when I walked tall in front of a crowd of establishment people
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:21.880]  and aren't ashamed of their insults and their and their giggling and their
[1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:27.280]  hateful looks by the end of it by the end of private talks I've had with
[1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:31.640]  people public talks I've had with you know pretty high-level folks in media by
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:37.000]  the end of it you see admiration in their eye you see the fire of liberty a
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:43.760]  shadow of it beginning to kindle so you've got to lead you've got to lead

[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:33.440]  that government is trying to make quasi illegal and it's unprecedented we're
[1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:38.480]  gonna get an expert's take on this this press release by forex trading of
[1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:43.880]  over-the-counter gold and silver to be illegal beginning July 15th they tried
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:49.760]  to pass this before meanwhile gold derives the new record in GBP close to
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:54.400]  near record highs in euros and most currencies on global debt contagion risk
[1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:58.720]  and how that integrates in with senators unconcerned about massive
[1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:03.720]  consequences of criminalizing embedding of YouTube videos and YouTube is now
[1:25:03.720 --> 1:25:07.720]  taking videos down and putting up not that it's a copyright violation or not
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:12.160]  that it violates terms of use but under government request in the US and England
[1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:17.800]  so the system scared folks they're going into a major global conflict they're
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:21.640]  trying to implode nations and set up this new bank of the world they've got
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:28.840]  to destroy our society to rebuild it in their tyrannical image of people like
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:33.760]  Larry Summers and the rest of the globalist so I'm gonna be breaking that
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:37.040]  down some of the next segment I'm gonna get into Rick Perry also what is the true
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:42.000]  definition of this new global war that's being launched we're gonna be breaking
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:48.160]  all of that down and continuing with calls who's up next John Matt and mass
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:58.000]  you're on the air thanks for holding oh Alex hey many topics I would discuss it
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:02.120]  for you but I know my time is limited so I have a question and a couple of
[1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:09.360]  comments your country on movie how's that coming you know I just I've made all
[1:26:09.360 --> 1:26:14.480]  or more of like four films and just never finished them because I've gotten so
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:19.600]  busy doing special reports getting ready for the TV show building the studio
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:26.280]  that I've started and stopped I don't know four or five films but I'm probably
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:32.960]  gonna roll the chemtrails into an overall eugenics film you know kind of an
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:38.560]  in-game to but more than that well I believe you're right on track with that
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:45.240]  my opinion is the chemtrail is the original hole at least in America I live
[1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:48.880]  up in your master's at the Boston area no there's I mean it's admitted there's
[1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:53.080]  total weather manipulation the government and Obama's science are admitted
[1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:55.920]  first speech he gave they are manipulating the weather but they call it
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:27:02.640]  testing because under US code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1520 a paragraph
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:07.120]  B they're allowed to do chemical biological radiological or other testing
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:12.960]  including weather modification for any that code prohibits it unless it's for
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:18.320]  testing unless it's for research that's why they call all these giant programs
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:24.960]  research it never becomes an official program sorry go ahead well I agree and
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:29.560]  I they are thrown everything at us and there was just so much that the throne
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:33.720]  out as it's a niche my head spin but I really believe the attempt to over the
[1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:38.840]  ace in the hole because not only does it kill all the crops but I look what it
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:46.040]  does to the body of body absorbs it and I've noticed me and my friends they
[1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:53.480]  all have all kinds of elements through the back it joints and it also it's a
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:58.600]  it's a magnet for the radioactive isotopes coming this way I want to be
[1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:04.360]  clear they are admittedly spring barium salts and aluminum dioxide and other
[1:28:04.360 --> 1:28:07.960]  things but the aluminum dioxide does precipitate out in the brain Alzheimer's
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:12.240]  young people now getting it and it does precipitate out on the bones and the
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:16.080]  film that we carry that's excellent what the world they spring shows that all
[1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:20.720]  over the country where the springs going on they have the even people that
[1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:26.040]  work for state government showing that aluminum has gone up tenfold in many
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.760]  areas the last decade they started the chemtrailing in the mid-90s and so yes
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:34.440]  sir they are killing the soils but don't worry Monsanto's coming out with a
[1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:41.120]  whole line of aluminum resistant seeds and plants isn't that nice yes that is
[1:28:41.120 --> 1:28:47.240]  beautiful they love just yeah a couple other just one of the thing listen you
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:52.840]  gotta get the word out to all the gun owners and the second member advocates
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:58.120]  that they have got to keep their guns they cannot let the government or the
[1:28:58.120 --> 1:29:03.640]  police state come and confiscate their guns they must hold on and fight
[1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:07.920]  absolutely and that's why they're chemtrailing the Midwest trying to shut
[1:29:07.920 --> 1:29:12.160]  down the heart of America that's why they're trying to pass the food safety
[1:29:12.160 --> 1:29:16.160]  act that openly puts regulations on farms and ranches small ones the big
[1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:20.560]  ones are exempt remember what Obama said we can play the audio he's behind
[1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:24.760]  closed doors he said and it's not surprising that they get bitter they
[1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:29.120]  cling to their guns or religion or
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:35.920]  anti-apathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or
[1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:42.240]  anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations and he's setting up
[1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:47.680]  the new commissar the new Soviet threat fusion center commissar over your real

[1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:27.400]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:13.080]  heart of the resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:17.400 --> 1:33:22.320]  okay I will continue with open phones and try to hurry through them and then
[1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:25.880]  continue with calls in the third hour and I'm gonna cover massive amounts of
[1:33:25.880 --> 1:33:29.680]  news that we haven't even gotten to yet it becomes really harder and harder to
[1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:32.880]  do the shows there's so much information you want to cover it all
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:37.760]  properly and really dig down into it but it's just impossible you've got to
[1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:43.400]  track the websites info wars.com prisonplanet.tv gcnlive.com the
[1:33:43.400 --> 1:33:47.200]  network site has a lot of the news we cover and some of the news that doesn't
[1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:59.240]  make it up on our sites that's gcnlive.com now in 1933 we saw the war
[1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:06.200]  powers act come in after three years of depression from 29 to 33 and that's when
[1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:09.480]  they set up the state police that are really federal police that's when the
[1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:13.360]  feds really started standardization of everything that's when the United States
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:18.280]  went into receivership to predominantly the foreign European banks that had set
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:22.400]  up the Federal Reserve that's why today most the quote bailout money they hold
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:25.720]  his hostage and say give us more money of the world financial system will
[1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:29.480]  collapse you look at the numbers they created it we have their own documents
[1:34:29.480 --> 1:34:33.480]  they designed it to implode our economies as each country pays in
[1:34:33.480 --> 1:34:37.840]  trillions more they only get deeper into debt because the very money they're
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:42.400]  giving the private banks is then charged back to the population with
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:46.560]  interest to the very banks that are given the money you heard me right I
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:52.200]  know that is so insane it makes no sense because you give them your money and
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:57.040]  then they charge you interest for giving them the money you heard me right it's a
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:03.280]  good business if you could con people to set it up and they did they did but
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:10.680]  something that in the war powers act and my grandmother's father my great
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:17.280]  grandfather owned what was the first Chevy dealership in Dallas and you know
[1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:20.840]  the word is he didn't turn the gold in when he was told to the that's what
[1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:25.880]  grandma told me and a lot of people didn't turn their gold and silver in all
[1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:29.760]  over the country but they came out and they said turn your gold turn your
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:35.280]  silver in we're gonna give you paperback for it Roosevelt got on the radio the
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:40.880]  fireside chat and told the suckers to do it and percentage of the public lined up
[1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:44.760]  and gave gave them their money and then publicly the gold was shipped to Europe
[1:35:44.760 --> 1:35:48.960]  the Firestone family got charged a year later was setting up a dummy cop
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:53.400]  corporation to buy their own gold back it was the gold was shipped to the Roth
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:57.240]  Childs and others overseas and then a year later they basically doubled the
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:01.000]  price of gold and then made it legal for the public to have it again so you
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:04.080]  could buy your own gold back from them at double the price so people've always
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:07.920]  said well if you promote gold they confiscated well why own a house then
[1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:12.520]  they could take that why have children CPS might take them don't give up on
[1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:18.480]  life live and then fight but yes the criminals are going to try all of this
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:21.640]  they're gonna try to tax the internet they're gonna try to shut down free
[1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:24.720]  speech they're gonna try to force you on the internet to they're gonna try to
[1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:29.560]  control with artificial programs what you can type what you can videotape what
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:35.600]  you can do it's all admitted all the devices you buy now you pay for the
[1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:40.480]  added cost of the government regulated and in some cases I even regulated just
[1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:47.560]  agreed upon consensus to put spy systems on board it and then you pay for it now
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:52.680]  to get to this new story I want to go to the FBI Federal Bureau of Investigation
[1:36:52.680 --> 1:36:57.520]  Western District Office North Carolina and we'll put this on screen your radio
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:02.280]  listener it's up on prisonplanet.tv but we've also written articles about it and
[1:37:02.280 --> 1:37:06.160]  you just type in FBI or Justice Department press release on Liberty
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:12.200]  Dollar and the top link is those guys and you'll be at the FBI website that's
[1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:17.000]  FBI.gov forward slash Charlotte forward slash press dash release forward slash
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:21.520]  2011 forward slash defendant dash convicted dot dot dot and the reason I
[1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:25.280]  raise that is every time I mentioned this folks say I'm making it up trolls
[1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:30.920]  online on info wars on YouTube they they know it's real a lot of these are
[1:37:30.920 --> 1:37:35.800]  actually sock puppet admitted Pentagon drone programs that look like real
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:40.360]  people but they're not and we've been able to track the IPs and confirm most of
[1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:45.200]  them are and but the actual real operators these are cold-blooded people
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:49.080]  that know this is real just like every other real issue but they're gonna come
[1:37:49.080 --> 1:37:52.640]  tell you it isn't true to just create confusion kind of like when they're
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:56.640]  smashing tanks into the Waco church they're saying come out with your hands
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:37:59.680]  up this is not an assault when the Davidians came out it's on the flare
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:03.640]  footage they would shoot them with machine guns you could see the guys the
[1:38:03.640 --> 1:38:07.760]  troops from behind the tank shooting the Bradley fighting vehicles the people
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:11.400]  falling down and then they roll the tanks up and on them and then the kids
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:15.360]  were hiding out and the special forces went in and put the bomb on top of the
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:18.400]  church records vault the only concrete part of the building and killed those
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:23.240]  babies real good because they deserved it but yeah none of that's real either
[1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:27.640]  continuing here and then these are hardcore predators and they enjoy their
[1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:32.040]  job so they're gonna tell you this isn't real so I just gave you the URL phone
[1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:37.640]  numbers the FBI defendant convicted of many his own currency and they used a
[1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:41.320]  hand-picked federal jury and they they keep these juries these juries has been
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:45.240]  proven that's why they have a 98% conviction rate you really believe 98%
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:49.400]  guilty that's why they would send a puppy to the gas chamber for killing JFK
[1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:52.880]  they would do anything they're told these juries their hand-picked juries
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:56.080]  most of them get paid off by the feds to put innocent people in prison
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:05.280]  nut house for 14 years Bernard von Note house like note and house has openly been
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:10.800]  printing his own gold and silver coins and it's totally legal what you got eight
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:16.680]  states now passing or about to pass laws to do the same thing it's it's always
[1:39:16.680 --> 1:39:20.440]  been part of America and Ron Paul supported it and his brother's been
[1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:25.760]  involved in a separate company Wayne Paul and it's totally legal but they went
[1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:29.480]  and told the jury this is counterfeiting he's trying to claim his US currency
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:33.480]  when he said the opposite the whole thing was attacking the private Federal
[1:39:33.480 --> 1:39:38.400]  Reserve so see they're saying he was imitating a real currency when our own
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:43.760]  currency since 1913 has been Federal Reserve notes not US dollars but but
[1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:49.920]  note house didn't try to imitate the the the the counterfeit Federal Reserve
[1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:58.840]  bills but notes of debt notes of your servitude and they didn't care and even
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:03.760]  the Associated Press had to say that the US statute does not say this was
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:09.040]  counterfeiting and wow how did he get convicted well how is any of this I mean
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:12.920]  how's the TSA now with Texas State reps in the head of the Texas Energy
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:16.360]  Commission telling them you're being punished for being against groping line
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:19.880]  up and this is on Fox News locally I played yesterday and actually grabbing
[1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:24.480]  and squeezing their their the male genitals to make them ride in pain and
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:29.200]  saying is this punishment yes it's punishment I mean I mean these are
[1:40:29.200 --> 1:40:32.680]  jail guards you're a prisoner you didn't do anything wrong you don't get it
[1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:38.040]  tyranny is when the criminals are the jail guards okay so everything's a big
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:41.240]  prison your kids are learning how to be prisoners everything now listen to what
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:46.600]  the US Attorney in their press release said and and again they go on to say he
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:53.360]  is a unique type of terrorist and quote terrorist will not be allowed to
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:57.280]  operate attempts to undermine the legitimate the legitimate currency of
[1:40:57.280 --> 1:41:02.040]  this country now remember it's JP Morgan Goldman Sachs openly running this they
[1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:05.600]  devalue the dollar the Chinese have said they've technically defaulted the
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:10.920]  dollars plunging global crisis this is not their fault it's Von
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:15.400]  Nothouse's fault okay and I told you this is because they're getting ready to
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:18.600]  come out for the gold and silver let's have an open fight over it let's throw
[1:41:18.600 --> 1:41:22.440]  in their fat let's see him try to get away with it they're not going to call
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:27.440]  the the the tyrants bluff like weiner and the rest of them attempts to
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:32.000]  undermine the legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:39.600]  domestic terrorism that's right that's right you are a terrorist and what do
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:44.120]  they do per state per year thousands of cases using the Patriot Act waving the
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:46.880]  bill of rights breaking in your house without warrants digging through your
[1:41:46.880 --> 1:41:50.120]  trash without warrants spying on you with no probable cause that's now in the
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:58.000]  official FBI manual AP last week just know nothing the total head shields
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:05.360]  down shields are down they're releasing their criminal federal armies they're
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:09.000]  federalizing the police you try to have a protest they'll crack your skull open
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:13.760]  so fast old lady comes out of a shopping center with a bag that g20 the cops they
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:17.000]  get off the street she tries to they release the dog laughing as an old
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:23.560]  woman's chewed up these are mad dog psychos I'm not saying all the police are
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:31.560]  but it when they get in a mob psychology they are all right continuing and by the
[1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:34.720]  way that they've given them this glenn becky and template the conservative cops
[1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:39.200]  that all protesters are seiu communist that they can't wait I've seen the
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:44.000]  comments online to shoot protesters so they've really done a sigh out number
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:48.240]  no everywhere where the seiu is beating people up they're allowed to beat people
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:54.840]  up and left alone on video attempts to undermine I'm gonna read this again
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:59.160]  attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country this country
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:01.520]  doesn't exist anymore it's under federal rule what what the wiki leaks
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:06.360]  documents two weeks ago prove what we already told you an in-game we've been
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:10.160]  in a north american union since 2005 and the first part of the document is keep
[1:43:10.160 --> 1:43:14.880]  this a secret integration by stealth north american integration by stealth
[1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:20.000]  that's a quote oh but governments don't do anything in stealth that's the
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:24.720]  prevailing common-sense knowledge we're told well no it's not everybody knows
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:29.000]  deep down the truth they just keep the hoax going saying the majority agree
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.960]  with that when the majority don't let me read this again then we're going to talk
[1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:36.440]  to an expert on this attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this
[1:43:36.440 --> 1:43:41.720]  country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism wow what a sentence
[1:43:41.720 --> 1:43:45.200]  what a what a sentence it's not the internationalist evaluating the
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:49.040]  currency when they are on record and if you try to have your own gold and silver
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:54.120]  you're a terrorist that's quite a sentence you as attorney tomkins said
[1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:57.720]  in the announcing verdict while these forms of anti-government activities do
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:44:01.000]  not involve violence see being anti-government if you're against what
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:04.160]  the government's doing that's anti-government that's illegal I thought
[1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:07.080]  in America I could be against government policies I thought I was the
[1:44:07.080 --> 1:44:12.400]  person I thought the I was on top I was the sovereign in America no no no you do
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:18.480]  what the government says even when 99% of people are against the banker bailout
[1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:22.360]  it passes 70 plus percent against government around health care it passes
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:27.680]  they don't care 90 plus percent against TSA grub downs they still do it they
[1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:32.800]  don't care see and they're saying it's terrorism it's anti-government terror
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:37.400]  anti-government is terrorism you don't like it you don't like what color the
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:41.200]  street signs are it's a form of terrorism you've got an opinion on light rail in
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:44.960]  your town or not wanting to pay for a formula one track for some billionaire
[1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:49.600]  heiress outside Austin your anti-government and how do you become
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:53.480]  pro-government you sit down and shut up because the government's official it's
[1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:57.760]  the authority you don't have a right to an opinion in America you shut out and
[1:44:57.760 --> 1:45:04.800]  shut up all we got the nation and take the veterans pensions again attempts to
[1:45:04.800 --> 1:45:08.080]  undermine legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:11.640]  domestic terrorism US Attorney Tom can send announcing the verdict all these
[1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:16.040]  forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence they are every bit
[1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:21.520]  as insidious and represent a clear and present danger see and that invokes
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:25.560]  war powers clause that's why Obama doesn't need Congress right now to launch
[1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:29.400]  all these wars he's saying I got war powers we're in an emergency see they
[1:45:29.400 --> 1:45:33.600]  invoke emergency there they invoke martial law they just don't call it that
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:39.800]  but that's what the US code says we're in martial law US Attorney Tom can
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:43.920]  send announcing the verdict all these forms of anti-government activities do
[1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:49.320]  not involve violence they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:53.840]  present danger to the economics ability of the country again it's their bosses
[1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:56.760]  that illegitimately hijacked the country doing this to us but that doesn't
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:02.280]  matter she added we are determined to meet these threats through infiltration
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:06.560]  infiltration this is military operation they're gonna infiltrate
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:10.920]  disruption and dismantling of organizations would seek to challenge
[1:46:10.920 --> 1:46:17.520]  you don't challenge you know again that's an action a political action you
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:21.200]  don't that's why we go out and protest the Fed or Ron Paul does we've got the
[1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:25.240]  secret documents where the US Army is there and it says in the in the reports
[1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:29.080]  don't let them know your army they'll try to kill you they actually lying
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:32.520]  military men and women up say when you're undercover in Dallas covering
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:36.200]  Alex Jones protest or Ron Paul in Houston at the end the Fed rally don't

[1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:57.440]  have a uniform and a badge that everything they do is good and we are bad
[1:46:57.440 --> 1:47:06.200]  we're it goes on to say disruption and dismantling of organizations would
[1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:10.720]  seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government oh that's
[1:47:10.720 --> 1:47:14.840]  a double-speak we're openly speaking out against corruption so we're
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:18.960]  challenging the democratic form of government because we're a democracy
[1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:23.480]  where it's we the people right we're really a republic but we're we're
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:27.920]  terrorists for exercising and it goes on okay now I've read that I want to

[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:46.160]  counterfeiting when it's the fellow reserve that created the counterfeit
[1:48:46.160 --> 1:48:52.760]  and destroyed our wealth and then they go through from the 4x team how they're
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:59.840]  breaking down section 742 a Ted Anderson what is going on here well Alex
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:04.360]  you've covered so much of it I mean I can tell you the executive order of 1933
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:09.080]  which was signed by president president Franklin D Roosevelt confiscated gold
[1:49:09.080 --> 1:49:15.720]  from the people at a price of $26 an ounce I'm sorry $20 and 67 cents an
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:20.720]  ounce and a year later they raised the price to $35 an ounce rating the
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:24.520]  people's wealth and that was done for the bailout for the bailout of the
[1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:28.520]  banking system this Federal Reserve banking community that was going on at
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:32.040]  that time pulling the strings which they're doing the same now and again it
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:36.200]  was a robbery it wasn't they called it a bailout but but they take the profits
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:39.560]  up the back door like the mafia does with a restaurant and then basically when
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:43.840]  they're done burn the restaurant down and collect the insurance so that's what
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:48.200]  brings us to today Alex I mean the forex first of all the forex market is
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:54.640]  about currencies it's about trading US dollar for Swiss Frank or US dollar for
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:58.440]  Italian lira whatever you know that type of thing that market is for trading
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:03.160]  currencies from one place to another this Dodd-Frank bill along with Obama's

[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:19.280]  by the way you know the TSA all those snow globes and pocket knives and shampoo
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:25.960]  they love it when it's new they make money off of it and here is the statesman
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:31.240]  Austin American statesman where of all the snow globes gone to the state surplus
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:36.800]  store that's where they raise the property taxes so you can't pay it so
[1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:42.320]  they get it this is all a monopoly game and they've ordered our gold turned in
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:47.280]  before they've taken it and openly shipped it to Europe and I guess if they
[1:54:47.280 --> 1:54:49.920]  have somebody like Franklin Delano Roosevelt do it you know over the
[1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:53.960]  radio again most Americans if the government told Americans to murder
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:56.880]  their children I think 30% would walk them out shoot them in the back of the
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:00.360]  head I mean they'd say it's the government your conspiracy theorist if
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:04.560]  you disagree disagreeing with tyrannies called conspiracy theory having an
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:12.600]  opinion and the private central banks that run America are openly imploding
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:16.880]  our economy they're pro imploding Europe's economy people are rushing in to
[1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:20.480]  get gold and silver because then that saves their wealth because as the
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:24.760]  currency devalued the gold goes up gold is going up all over the world but not
[1:55:24.760 --> 1:55:29.920]  as fast as it's not going up as fast here because they're manipulating it
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:35.720]  well now they're gonna try to shut down the free flow of it even more because
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:42.680]  they're desperate because gold and silver exposes their true fiat counterfeit
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:47.360]  money that's why they have the FBI and these rulings saying you're terrorist
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:52.280]  the folks we know we're not terrorist they're the terrorist it's time to wake
[1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:56.240]  up and recognize this and hey FBI if you're not a terrorist speak out against
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:56:00.320]  this but we all know the truth you know about Oklahoma City you know about 9-11
[1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:04.560]  and a lot of you aren't individually terrorist just like individual German
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:10.400]  soldiers we're not many of Nazis but you might as well have the spirit of that
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:14.600]  off Hitler or mouse a tongue running America right now and if we don't
[1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:17.520]  recognize that it's over it's only gonna get worse from here
[1:56:17.520 --> 1:56:23.080]  Ted Anderson other comments and points on this well I mean Alex I mean that's
[1:56:23.080 --> 1:56:28.400]  it's that is the reason why I am giving away silver dollars with your videos
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:33.120]  because this is the kind of crap that the government's gonna pull and if the
[1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:36.880]  people aren't walking up to the fact of what they're doing if they can't open
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:41.200]  their eyes to this they're gonna get away with it they are now forcing people
[1:56:41.200 --> 1:56:45.520]  into this paper money this funny money that has no value to it that has forced
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:50.680]  this country to perpetual debt just like Jefferson said it would and we and now
[1:56:50.680 --> 1:56:53.720]  what are they doing they're trying to take gold and silver away from the
[1:56:53.720 --> 1:56:58.480]  people and that's why I've had this up you know it's it's it's about education
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:03.400]  people need to have gold and silver there's the paper currency is about
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:07.400]  ready to fall right into the toilet and for some reason the federal government
[1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:11.680]  thinks it's a good idea to force people out of gold and silver and in the paper
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:16.480]  I mean it just absolutely makes no sense at all and that that's you know I just
[1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:20.280]  can't say it enough Alex it's about education well ten hold on it makes
[1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:24.680]  perfect sense from the perspective of the tyrants they don't want us being
[1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:28.200]  self-sufficient they don't want us individually doing well the the entire
[1:57:28.200 --> 1:57:34.640]  policy is to destroy the middle class this is a wonderful wonderful plan and
[1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:40.160]  Ted how about you just admit it you're a terrorist I'm a terrorist it we're
[1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:43.680]  basically supporting Al Qaeda by not bowing down to Goldman Sachs and JP
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:49.640]  Morgan you know Goldman Sachs calling their customers a bunch of dumb sh you
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:55.080]  know what's that's good ripping people off taking the veterans death benefits
[1:57:55.080 --> 1:57:59.040]  secret deals that are now public that's freedom buddy if you're not for taking
[1:57:59.040 --> 1:58:03.520]  the veterans benefits you you're with Al Qaeda if you're not if you don't support
[1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:08.720]  Al Qaeda in Libya that our government supporting you're with Al Qaeda okay when
[1:58:08.720 --> 1:58:13.760]  they labeled when they were when they labeled bar not house as a terrorist and
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:19.320]  and and convicted him of crimes because he was making silver coins it you know
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:23.280]  that was that was the indicator they're good people they're good people stay

[2:00:12.520 --> 2:00:20.040]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:27.960]  alex jones you know i really have only scratched a few layers down into the
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:34.760]  news today and the system is definitely scared they're coming in trying to stop
[2:00:34.760 --> 2:00:40.200]  up with a counter gold and silver sales openly they'll pick a few people out to
[2:00:40.200 --> 2:00:45.240]  arrest and put in prison to try to scare everybody next they're going to tell you
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:51.000]  to turn it in and that's because they are putting it into high gear the process
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:55.840]  of totally devaluing our currency that's how the banksters do it and our
[2:00:55.840 --> 2:01:00.400]  journey towards third world serfdom will be complete and they know though that as
[2:01:00.400 --> 2:01:04.400]  they're devaluing it if people get into golden silver and get storeable foods
[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:07.680]  and educate their neighbors that you're going to have a large contingent of
[2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:15.040]  people who will be leaders in their communities and then they won't be able
[2:01:15.040 --> 2:01:18.560]  to sell their next global currency their next fiat currency that they're
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:22.800]  building on the ashes of america and europe and this is all official plans so
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:26.160]  they've got to clamp down on the purchase of golden silver but they're going to
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:30.240]  leave it legal in a few places like switzerland where the globalists are
[2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:33.600]  based they leave a few places safe for them to operate
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:39.440]  where they're then going to get your gold for pennies on the dollar
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:42.480]  and you better be forward or you're a terrorist you better hand your gold in
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:47.200]  the fellow reserve so we can be given to goldman sacks and jp morgan
[2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:50.720]  because lord knows they need more money and power well as for me i'm not turning
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:53.520]  my golden silver and i've always explained this to people
[2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:56.800]  and it's just like campaign finance reform when they said that
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:00.400]  individuals you know in groups couldn't give money everybody just ignored it
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:04.320]  they said a talk show host months before an election couldn't
[2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:08.560]  have an opinion on the second amendment or abortion we just all ignored it
[2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:12.880]  and that's what it comes down to that's why it's important to support silver and
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:17.120]  gold dealers that are out there uh... ted the deadline is coming up July 15th
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:20.480]  and there's also some loopholes with collectors and stuff that we mainly
[2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:24.000]  pitch bullion because overall that is the safest
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:27.200]  best bet out there but if you do the research you got great collectors as
[2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:29.680]  well they're quote non confiscatable but they may
[2:02:29.680 --> 2:02:33.040]  change that too but people say i'm not having kids the world so bad
[2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:36.800]  have more kids when the world is bad good people need to have children
[2:02:36.800 --> 2:02:42.000]  thrive bet on life commit to fighting evil don't give in to evil
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:46.080]  by by laying down have more children work harder build
[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:49.520]  be more aggressive get into golden silver it's that simple
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:52.640]  tell you haven't plug this in a few weeks gold has
[2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:57.360]  shot way back up it's trading at all-time highs
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:04.560]  some areas overseas trading where's my article on that i had the article
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:08.400]  i just had that stupid thing here in front of me well it didn't matter it's
[2:03:08.400 --> 2:03:11.680]  it's oh here it is gold rises a new record
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:17.680]  in gbp close to near record high in euros and most currencies on global
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:21.840]  debt contagion though domestically they're manipulating the forex trying to
[2:03:21.840 --> 2:03:25.200]  keep it down but they're not successful you bought golden silver
[2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:28.800]  when it went down to this debt like it always does before racing back up
[2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:33.280]  you can pass those specials on folks say radio special when you call to get it
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:36.320]  ted tell folks about a few of the specials you've got
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:40.240]  yeah well i mean just right now presently the some of the best buys that we
[2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:43.760]  have going on right now are the again the british sovereigns
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:48.400]  frank's uh frank said 333 right now i held that price down there up on the
[2:03:48.400 --> 2:03:52.080]  internet a lot more british sovereigns are a 418 again
[2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:55.040]  a price that's uh much lower than what you'll find on the internet
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:04:00.240]  you know even everything's becoming so scarce and silver it's not even funny
[2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:06.320]  uh not silver al-qaeda rounds yeah i know that i mean that's but you've

[2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:09.760]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:12.800]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[2:05:12.800 --> 2:05:16.720]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:20.080]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[2:05:20.080 --> 2:05:23.520]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:05:23.520 --> 2:05:27.920]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:31.520]  the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[2:05:31.520 --> 2:05:35.600]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:39.120]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[2:05:39.120 --> 2:05:43.600]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step by step instructions

[2:06:05.840 --> 2:06:09.040]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:13.040]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:16.320]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[2:06:16.320 --> 2:06:20.640]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[2:06:20.640 --> 2:06:25.520]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:29.520]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[2:06:29.520 --> 2:06:33.680]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[2:06:33.680 --> 2:06:36.480]  ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[2:06:36.480 --> 2:06:40.720]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[2:06:40.720 --> 2:06:44.080]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:47.600]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:03.600]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[2:07:03.600 --> 2:07:07.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:11.600]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:15.040]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:07:15.040 --> 2:07:19.200]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[2:07:19.200 --> 2:07:22.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas
[2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:25.040]  of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:07:25.040 --> 2:07:28.960]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:32.560]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[2:07:32.560 --> 2:07:35.600]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:07:35.600 --> 2:07:38.320]  onages number five a solar power generator
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:42.000]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:45.360]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:50.400]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[2:07:50.400 --> 2:07:54.400]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun

[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:08.000]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:13.920]  okay we're gonna go to gene steve genie johnny watchman and others that have

[2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:28.320]  from you and then at the bottom of the hour i'm
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:31.360]  going to do a big news blitz i'm gonna go there a bunch of headlines
[2:08:31.360 --> 2:08:34.960]  i'm also going to give you my take on the whole uh situation
[2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:39.280]  with taking out under god one nation under god can't have a nation
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:42.240]  because you're part of a world government can't say under god
[2:08:42.240 --> 2:08:46.800]  it's all about destroying the existing order and system
[2:08:46.800 --> 2:08:51.760]  and and and training you that that the establishment is going to change
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:58.880]  your rituals change uh your pastimes change uh the basic bedrock of the
[2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:02.240]  society and and the message isn't even so much
[2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:05.520]  what matters it's that they tell you what you can and can't say
[2:09:05.520 --> 2:09:10.480]  it's like google owned youtube saying uh you
[2:09:10.480 --> 2:09:14.080]  put out a video saying that everybody should hang up
[2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:20.880]  posters as obama as the joker because the media was calling for the arrest of
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:24.480]  whoever had done it saying you can't defile our furor
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:29.360]  i said in the video even if i liked obama which i didn't at the time in
[2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:32.640]  2009 i would now have to hang these posters up
[2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:35.520]  because in the media is calling for the arrest of whoever first did it in
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:39.440]  california i said that is totally unamerican
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:44.960]  and they took it down blocked it put a strike on our account for racism and
[2:09:44.960 --> 2:09:48.640]  we've got copies of the letters up at info wars dot com i went and filed
[2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:53.360]  against it and they shut down the alexio channel
[2:09:53.360 --> 2:09:57.040]  where you couldn't upload videos or use it they put a hold on it and they said
[2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:01.920]  challenging youtube when it comes from us we may completely
[2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:05.360]  you know delete your 50 something million views at the time now it's
[2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:10.400]  117 million and growing that's just one channel think about that
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:14.640]  and and and all those videos getting thousands of new views a week some of
[2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:17.440]  them tens of thousands videos that first get 300
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:20.640]  thousand views a year later got a million views i mean it's just all
[2:10:20.640 --> 2:10:24.240]  exponential a library of information of modern books it's
[2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:27.120]  book burning because my videos predominantly the special
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:32.160]  videos we do are documents articles video clips this is all done i pay
[2:10:32.160 --> 2:10:34.560]  for this i'm hiring more video editors we're
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:36.960]  going to put more of these out on prison planet dot tv
[2:10:36.960 --> 2:10:40.800]  more on youtube we're having a huge effect warning the people they perish
[2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:44.720]  for lack of knowledge and they say you brought all this value here you got
[2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:49.440]  hundreds of millions of views you you follow the terms of
[2:10:49.440 --> 2:10:51.520]  service but we're going to say you're a racist
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:54.720]  and shut your channel down
[2:10:57.440 --> 2:11:01.920]  and then people go on and say well it's a it's a free market
[2:11:01.920 --> 2:11:05.840]  really this is a monopoly they have over half of the video viewing in the world
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:09.120]  they're hooked in with the government and it's unfair trade practices it's
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:13.360]  it's it's it's false advertising to say come in here just follow these rules
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:17.360]  build something of extreme value culturally but also economically
[2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:20.560]  mainly to them we don't even put ads on the site
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:26.000]  and we're now going to falsely accuse you and slander you and libel you and
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:29.840]  defame you and then take your website away
[2:11:29.840 --> 2:11:34.160]  and that's what internet 2 is where you won't have a choice
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:38.080]  everything will be a subdomain of google or youtube or facebook
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:42.800]  or microsoft that's their public plan and everything is ai surveilled by the
[2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:46.160]  computers and then they decide when you go away
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:49.680]  they decide what you can and can't do
[2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:54.320]  and then they selectively enforce like when they try to take the account down
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:58.320]  i did a counter claim against it uh earlier this year where they said well
[2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:01.600]  your collateral murdered video shows a clip
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:05.680]  of the apache shooting up the royers reporters
[2:12:05.680 --> 2:12:08.800]  and we did a filing and and they came back and said all right we're frozen
[2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:12.080]  your account again this was a youtube strike
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:15.440]  we may shut your channel down if you're found to have challenged this improperly
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:18.960]  and i said go ahead i'm going to take legal action
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:23.440]  and my filings gave dozens of examples of abc news cnn
[2:12:23.440 --> 2:12:27.840]  rush you today with the same video clip on their youtube official channels
[2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:30.720]  they were left alone
[2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:36.560]  let's see i'm not allowed to show that only me because i'm bad
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:40.960]  i can't say hey they're calling for the arrest of whoever put out these obama
[2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:45.200]  posters saying he's a socialist even if it was racist they shouldn't be arrested
[2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:49.280]  but it obviously isn't we have to do all of us do this now
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:52.800]  to show them we won't be buffalowed by their intimidation and what does youtube
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:58.080]  do they shut it down and say i'm a racist
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:03.040]  you know when government health care you're a racist you're like what does it
[2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:06.800]  have to do with it like shut up racist oh see you're defending yourself now
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:09.920]  these people are the racist they're the ones that control everybody through
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:13.120]  race they're the ones that always bring up race
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:16.800]  they're the ones that make people obsess on it in high school and college whole
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:20.000]  courses not about mathematics quantum mechanics
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:24.240]  engineering literature beautiful things great things
[2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:28.160]  no it's all about diversity training and all this crud and to create
[2:13:28.160 --> 2:13:32.560]  guilds of people that think they're special protected groups
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:35.680]  and there's a headline is the obama joker pitcher racist
[2:13:35.680 --> 2:13:40.560]  oh i have msnbc saying i'm racist for putting that out you know what we're
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:43.280]  gonna do it again by the way i'm gonna announce a bunch of stuff
[2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:46.960]  we're going after google with posters on the streets
[2:13:46.960 --> 2:13:51.440]  we're going after obama again and i'm going after rick perry
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:54.880]  and don't worry they're gonna say it's racist to put up a rick perry as as
[2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:57.760]  some type of monster
[2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:01.360]  you're like but that doesn't make sense it doesn't matter they'll beat you over
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:04.400]  the head with it because they're training the mass of people
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:07.920]  that when they say it they go okay i said i go to your calls i'm out of control
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:11.040]  who's up next here john
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:16.240]  gene in michigan thanks for holding her on the air it's okay to be out of control
[2:14:16.240 --> 2:14:20.160]  i like she got good reason you know speaking of enforcers we have our own
[2:14:20.160 --> 2:14:23.200]  here in michigan i believe you're familiar with mr schneider rick
[2:14:23.200 --> 2:14:26.320]  schneider and his uh... public act number four
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:29.520]  it allows him to come in and take over local governments and school districts
[2:14:29.520 --> 2:14:33.840]  and disband any uh... he calls it he calls it economic
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:38.560]  martial law that's exactly what it is that's exactly what it is and i i hope
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:41.280]  you can add him to your hit list as well and maybe
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:45.760]  photoshop him in a nice ss uniform because he seems like he wants to put
[2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:49.600]  himself into a commandant's position with the uh... other cities under agenda
[2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:52.800]  21 and all over the world are making you give your
[2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:56.880]  your your house keys of the cops and that's totally reasonable
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:00.800]  i mean uh... some will say well we didn't do it before
[2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:04.480]  but things have changed in america and then hey let's get ready to not be able
[2:15:04.480 --> 2:15:06.800]  to buy gold and silver that that's freedom
[2:15:06.800 --> 2:15:10.400]  come on good things are happening here man goldman sacks runs our government
[2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:14.160]  they're good people i figure he must have seen one of your films
[2:15:14.160 --> 2:15:16.800]  about the regional uh... femacamp regions
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:19.600]  because i figured he's just setting himself up for for one of those uh...
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:22.640]  commandants uh... by the way uh... they have the
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:26.320]  uh... they have the ten uh... i'm a cover letter so go ahead
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:30.240]  he has to prove himself worthy by you know being the first governor to really
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:33.360]  come out and do this i mean he's taken over benton harbour he moved into
[2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:36.080]  apaniac just recently and they just signed this bill in the
[2:15:36.080 --> 2:15:41.600]  legislation in march of this year when they economically implode you
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:45.120]  they get to reorganize everything in the name of fixing it but then nothing
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:47.840]  ever gets fixed it only gets worse this is global
[2:15:47.840 --> 2:15:51.120]  receivership the end of freedom total depression
[2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:54.560]  but don't worry the government's going to save us
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:57.840]  move from benton harbour into apaniac a little larger a little more you know
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:01.120]  disband of the local police forces it's going to don't worry it's going to be
[2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:04.000]  covered by the state police and of course you've got flint in
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:07.520]  detroit following probably right behind as soon as they can figure out how to do
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:10.880]  it on a large scale but nafton yeah we're good for us
[2:16:10.880 --> 2:16:13.840]  look at how good it's been for michigan
[2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:17.520]  somebody you know factory workers who are just trying to you know provide a
[2:16:17.520 --> 2:16:20.880]  living for their families oh god forbid they should want
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:24.720]  uh... all profit sharing or health insurance and things of that nature
[2:16:24.720 --> 2:16:28.320]  has got you know it's a shame that they would ask for such things
[2:16:28.320 --> 2:16:31.280]  well they managed to take that away from us because so there goes
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:35.600]  i don't know maybe it's uh... you know destroying... gene what they've done
[2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:39.200]  your phone's breaking up and let you go is they've created another lie within a
[2:16:39.200 --> 2:16:42.880]  lie they tell conservatives who are well-meaning people in general
[2:16:42.880 --> 2:16:47.280]  hey we're going to disband cities and get rid of all the cops
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:50.960]  that'll fix the budget well that's the same story the same banks
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:53.520]  have done in other countries over and over again
[2:16:53.520 --> 2:16:59.120]  all of the new tax money and all of the cuts the vast majority of it
[2:16:59.120 --> 2:17:03.840]  goes to the private banks in the bailout money
[2:17:03.840 --> 2:17:07.520]  and then the economy implodes more and then there's more cuts
[2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:11.520]  and so it's a process where at the end the mega banks don't even get as much
[2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:14.880]  money in as they would have if they hadn't imploded the economy
[2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:18.320]  because the banks issued the money to begin with
[2:17:18.320 --> 2:17:22.160]  they make all their money on the default but you don't really owe the money so
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:26.480]  they go in put their politicians in who default and then
[2:17:26.480 --> 2:17:30.240]  technically uh... hand everything over to them i mean it's total economic
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:34.000]  conquest gene and uh... you know he calls it in
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:37.680]  michigan martial law economic martial law
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:41.680]  but you're not allowed to even call it that because oh that's a scary term
[2:17:41.680 --> 2:17:44.560]  and it's going to happen everywhere we're going into receivership
[2:17:44.560 --> 2:17:48.560]  to the private banking cartels who are admitted criminals
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:51.840]  the senate committee found total crime Goldman Sachs J.P. Morgan
[2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:55.760]  the other big mega banks the documents are public they engineered it all
[2:17:55.760 --> 2:17:59.600]  it's premeditated but see so many yuppies
[2:17:59.600 --> 2:18:04.240]  are in la la land well they're not in la land they're in make-believe land
[2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:09.600]  kind of like the kids in uh... peter pan go to neverland they never really left
[2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:12.800]  the bedroom at night they're just playing and imagining that's what that
[2:18:12.800 --> 2:18:16.960]  book's all about well adults imagine that oh this is a scary
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:20.480]  government this scary tyranny i'll just decide it's okay and call
[2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:25.280]  those people extremists that are awake that's what cowards do cowards lie to
[2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:28.720]  themselves so they make believe everything's okay
[2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:31.600]  i've got all these democrats attacking me sending me threatening emails and
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:34.400]  comments that i'm this right-wing racist scum and that
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:37.680]  obama's saving people with all these new wars
[2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:40.960]  they're not going to turn loose of their delusion they love it
[2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:44.240]  that's why they're losers it's why their failures

[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:13.120]  more and in the first line they talk about a
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:17.520]  disgruntled veteran with firearms the scouts go in in the drill and kill the
[2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:21.200]  vet and of course we told you about this 15
[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:24.240]  years ago but now it's it's all been released
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:29.520]  uh at these training seminars for police and now boy scouts
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:33.440]  they spend maybe one percent of the time on al-qaeda
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:37.920]  the whole deal is about gun owners those that want to get rid of the fed
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:44.240]  sovereign citizens people that think the federal government's out of control
[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:48.000]  and you know i get sarcastic i get angry
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:51.040]  because it actually hurts you know a caller earlier
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:55.360]  a caller earlier asked me how i handle it
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:24:59.200]  it hurts me what they're doing to these children
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:05.120]  it hurts me as somebody who studied rome the soviets the malvest uh what goes
[2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:08.880]  on in africa today these warlords always get kids
[2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:14.400]  and uh train them first to be spies lausatis does that down in mexico
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:20.880]  and then next they give them guns and to know that the boy scouts are trained
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:24.800]  uh especially the explorer scouts 14 and up
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:30.400]  that and and the rotc i knew about this 15 years ago all over the country
[2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:34.000]  but i've actually been invited one time to observe it
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:37.360]  uh from a hilltop while it was going on in san antonio they didn't know i was
[2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:41.200]  watching it at the university but i i observed them
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:45.920]  and then later got the documents so the marine rotc training to quote
[2:25:45.920 --> 2:25:50.560]  take on raid houses and take guns and and that's come out in the news we've
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:53.280]  had kernels on who admit they do door-to-door gun confiscation drills
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:57.840]  for america and to just think how unamerican these scout
[2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:01.280]  leaders are and how just flat out wicked and yes they have substations
[2:26:01.280 --> 2:26:06.240]  everywhere we first got photos and videos of this in 2005
[2:26:06.240 --> 2:26:11.200]  of boy scouts with the national and state guard places like alabama
[2:26:11.200 --> 2:26:16.480]  missouri and other areas and you go to bay fest in alabama
[2:26:16.480 --> 2:26:20.080]  was one example or others or you go to the high school football game
[2:26:20.080 --> 2:26:24.800]  and they'll be 12 year olds bugging their eyes out in uniforms
[2:26:24.800 --> 2:26:29.680]  and then the reports are pouring in tsa was in portland at a parade this
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:33.600]  weekend asking questions shoving people around
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:37.360]  and it's just to train the public to have folks in uniforms bugging their eyes
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:41.200]  out but in any tyranny it's an auxiliary brown shirt
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:44.960]  unofficial group and then they recruit from those
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:50.400]  into the official police force and and and the
[2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:54.960]  it's a hundred percent the country has cultural cancer
[2:26:54.960 --> 2:26:58.240]  and every time i mentioned these articles about brownies and even got the
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:02.320]  training manual trained to watch their parents i mean
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:06.000]  they're training 10 year old girls to watch mommy and daddy
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:10.800]  i mean that is beyond the soviet union
[2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:16.400]  our government is run by private corporations that use it to rob us and
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:18.960]  to milk us
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:25.120]  and here we have the kids also playing the part rob douche shot this video up
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:28.320]  in chicago they have the kids playing the part of prisoners
[2:27:28.320 --> 2:27:33.680]  learned helplessness that's with a polish and check republic troops training
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:37.760]  and they have a gun confiscation drill then they had a drill at the sport
[2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:42.080]  stadium in chicago what stadium was that
[2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:50.800]  yeah the toyota arena uh how to round us up and break us up

[2:27:55.760 --> 2:27:58.320]  and blaming on ron paul and myself they're gonna they're gonna continue to
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:01.760]  poison the water we got croaks running the country and and you know what in the
[2:28:01.760 --> 2:28:05.280]  end they're gonna fall just like the nazis or just like the soviet union but
[2:28:05.280 --> 2:28:08.320]  a lot of us aren't going to make it to this fight but i'm here to tell you
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:10.880]  we're going to defeat the new world order we're going to defeat the terrorists
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:14.560]  that run this country we're going to get america back we don't have a choice
[2:28:14.560 --> 2:28:17.520]  uh sorry steven georgia finish up your story so

[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:32.000]  police badge is painted on side of the building
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:36.800]  a little hut that once was a cub scout hut no no i mean they were taking them
[2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:40.720]  over and i get voice call people send them emails saying it's not true
[2:28:40.720 --> 2:28:44.560]  i'm sorry go ahead they were doing judo moves one day
[2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:49.360]  you know it's almost like you know the obama uh civil army you know little
[2:28:49.360 --> 2:28:53.600]  kids i you know i got i got your videos along the silver
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:58.320]  and i'm making copies but everybody's just like avoiding me like a plague like
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:02.720]  i have lost my freaking mind when i've been awake for about
[2:29:02.720 --> 2:29:06.960]  maybe five years you know i took the red pill and
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:13.120]  they're like just scared like don't don't show me this i don't i don't want to
[2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:17.200]  know that you know here's what you need to do you need to go to those events
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:20.480]  you need to youtube it you need to speak about you need to go to city council
[2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:24.720]  because it's a homeland security program all over the country
[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:28.720]  and they entice the kids with paintball fights and judo and stuff

[2:34:20.160 --> 2:34:24.880]  attention the my act the homeland security the ron paul
[2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:28.560]  military documents that the military leaked to us because

[2:34:50.720 --> 2:34:54.480]  they don't even hide this where they train the explorer scouts
[2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:59.200]  to kill the disgruntled veteran to go to the farmhouse of the
[2:34:59.200 --> 2:35:04.640]  of the free stator or the free man or the sovereign citizen

[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:11.520]  can't pay their property taxes a lot of times they're rural
[2:35:11.520 --> 2:35:14.880]  and they're terrorists well yeah you got somebody on their grandpappy's land
[2:35:14.880 --> 2:35:17.840]  they can't pay for it the economy's falling apart so the lower in taxes
[2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:21.200]  you raise them and then in the drills and i've been to these drills they
[2:35:21.200 --> 2:35:24.400]  don't even hide some of this they practice killing
[2:35:24.400 --> 2:35:28.640]  hillbillies listen you think i'm joking i'm going back to
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:32.320]  steven everybody else this is a key article from the economic
[2:35:32.320 --> 2:35:35.840]  collapse blog excellent analysis barack obama's white house
[2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:38.800]  rural council central economic planning for america's
[2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:43.040]  heartland they implode the economy they come in with quote help
[2:35:43.040 --> 2:35:47.280]  and it's even more control it's the same thing with the 10 regions of fema and
[2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:50.880]  the 10 governors bush set up its continuity of agenda this isn't just
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:53.120]  obama and then now they say well we don't have to
[2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:58.640]  do with the other governors say we've got 10 that are federally appointed
[2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:03.360]  and it goes on barack obama has issued a brand new executive order that
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:07.920]  establishes a white house rural council the rural council has been given the
[2:36:07.920 --> 2:36:11.040]  task of developing public private partnerships that means coming with
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:15.280]  government money to the select groups and believe me
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:19.040]  um this is all going to be anti-terrorism spine they've already had this
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:23.440]  going on in beta testing this will seek to bring the economic prosperity
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:26.720]  of our big cities to rural america in other words the u.s government the big
[2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:30.080]  corporations are going to team up to dominate the economies of small towns
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:33.360]  and rural communities just like they dominate the economies of all the big
[2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:36.720]  cities so should those that live in rural america be excited
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:39.680]  about this after all the u.s government and big corporations have done such a
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:42.080]  great job of bringing economic prosperity to places like
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:45.520]  detroit they say they're going to bulldoze the third of the city
[2:36:45.520 --> 2:36:49.200]  michigan and camden new jersey won't it be great to have the federal government
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:52.480]  come in and tell rural communities how they should be doing things
[2:36:52.480 --> 2:36:55.680]  they've already got the threat fusion centers they already got the boy scouts
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:36:59.120]  they already got the clergy response team spying on you the chair of the
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:02.720]  white house rural council will be agriculture secretary tom
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:07.360]  villasack he's a former governor of iowa and a democrat totally anti-gun i should
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:10.240]  add swing states like i will be key in o-12
[2:37:10.240 --> 2:37:14.640]  so perhaps obama is trying to show that he really cares about middle america
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:17.600]  but it is really hard to forget the remarks that
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:21.200]  obama made about rural americas during the o-8 campaign in particular
[2:37:21.200 --> 2:37:25.120]  the following quote about the bitterness of those living in rural america
[2:37:25.120 --> 2:37:30.080]  got a lot of attention at the time and uh i can't really do an imitation i can
[2:37:30.080 --> 2:37:36.240]  do a george bush and i uh and i uh
[2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:40.480]  and it's not surprising that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion
[2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:44.640]  or to apathy anti-apathy to people who aren't like them
[2:37:44.640 --> 2:37:48.320]  and or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment
[2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:52.240]  as a way to explain their frustrations yeah globalism has been really good for
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:55.840]  us hadn't it and it just goes on from there
[2:37:55.840 --> 2:37:59.360]  what the rural council is going to do just come in with the tax money they
[2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:03.120]  suck out of people and then give 30 cents of it back with strings attached
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:06.480]  so federal government and i got more reports in my stack of
[2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:10.960]  parades all over the country uh different sporting events
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:15.680]  they got army national guard and tsa and the descriptions by people that are
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:18.480]  there say they're you know they're they're putting on a tough
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:21.840]  kayak they're grunting and yelling at people and
[2:38:21.840 --> 2:38:25.600]  shoving them and getting in their face and crossing their arms and
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:28.960]  literally i've seen photos and videos of right next to national guard
[2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:33.280]  10 12-year-old kids crossing their arms in fact a lot of great info warriors have
[2:38:33.280 --> 2:38:36.560]  gone out and confronted the boy scouts and explained to them what's happening
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:39.680]  and they'll be there with a cop just looking at everybody going
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:43.680]  because they've been trained you don't trust americans these are enemies
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:47.120]  only the police only the military is good but then meanwhile the internal
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:51.520]  documents say once you're done being military or a cop
[2:38:51.520 --> 2:38:56.560]  you're the enemy it doesn't matter though you know here's the deal america and
[2:38:56.560 --> 2:38:59.920]  the rest of the world we're going into major global conflict we're going into
[2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:03.280]  a designed depression everything we've told you and
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:06.480]  fortunately so far has come true we tried to stop it
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:10.000]  we predicted the awakening as well there would be resistance that's
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:14.480]  uh law of physics that for every action there's an equal reaction
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:18.720]  and the great battle of civilization is on the great battle of liberty versus
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:23.120]  darkness is on and you better wake up to the war that's happening
[2:39:23.120 --> 2:39:26.640]  90 percent of its psychological warfare but 10 percent of its physical
[2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:31.280]  the taser deaths the checkpoints the the federally funded blood draws the
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:35.280]  the spy grids you better wake up and realize
[2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:38.880]  boy scouts at public events bugging their eyes out at you
[2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:45.600]  standing behind the army or the police is absolute 100 percent
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:52.000]  Stalinistic fantasy this is directly out of Hitler directly out of Stalin
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:56.160]  directly out of african dictatorships directly
[2:39:56.160 --> 2:40:02.480]  out of chavez venezuela it is cuban communism it is pure authoritarian
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:05.840]  absolute it's like if you wouldn't got an x-ray and there was a giant tumor this
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:09.680]  big on the x-ray uh what is that that's a tumor
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:14.800]  well what is this this is a case of tyranny we got it bad i mean if you're
[2:40:14.800 --> 2:40:18.000]  rolling around in the winter vomiting for three days and can't drink anything
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:25.440]  you got the flu i don't even America is so demonic
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:29.120]  we got good people here and and they don't deserve to be overrun but but but
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:32.720]  maybe they do because even though we're supposedly got good people in this
[2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:37.360]  country we've killed 51 million babies
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:40.640]  and we've gone i mean look at how evil the culture is look at just look at it
[2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:44.080]  all and you know what this is not even religious folks it's
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:48.400]  historical when you become corrupt
[2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:56.000]  when you go along with the system when you decide there's no morals
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:41:01.920]  100 of the time it ends up in hell physical hell while you're alive
[2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:05.600]  because every demon every control freak is released
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:09.200]  and now they got uniforms and they got weapons and they got plenty of little
[2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:12.320]  control freaks who couldn't get a job couldn't be successful
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:15.760]  who are now giving all this power
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:22.400]  you know they were just putting up on screen clips out of different news
[2:41:22.400 --> 2:41:25.600]  articles where the Boy Scouts talk about how they love the simulations of
[2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:29.040]  killing veterans do you have any idea what every
[2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:32.240]  tyranny from Russia to Nazi Germany to malice china did
[2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:36.000]  the first group when they really do the purge is the police
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:39.280]  there are a lot of police and military listening that think they're
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:43.440]  on the globalist team they are going to take you to a warehouse and shoot you in
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:47.040]  the head and you are not going to believe it when you pull in there
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:50.000]  and they got people being stuffed in body bags and you're getting your head
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:54.160]  blown off now you're going to find out it doesn't
[2:41:54.160 --> 2:41:56.240]  matter at least when they're lining you up about the
[2:41:56.240 --> 2:41:58.880]  splat of your but well you'll have a hood over your head you won't even see it
[2:41:58.880 --> 2:42:02.720]  at least repent at that point
[2:42:04.080 --> 2:42:07.760]  you think i said that for shock value hell is being released
[2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:10.960]  you don't know history this happens one
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:14.080]  hundred percent that give me a document cam shot that i'm going to the calls

[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:55.600]  the same garbage citizen spy squads kids spying on people
[2:42:55.600 --> 2:42:58.640]  i remember going and getting the footage from hebron maryland that's in police
[2:42:58.640 --> 2:43:02.160]  state 2000 of the boy scouts training and we even
[2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:05.760]  talked to locals were part of the drill to shut down the local gun shop and to
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:08.880]  go door to door and take guns from citizens and they had the boy scouts in
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:14.080]  hebron maryland in 1998 going in their parents houses
[2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:18.160]  and going back to the marines regular marines
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:22.160]  and reporting to them what guns their parents had
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:24.800]  and what did parents do when they found out most of them rationalized and said
[2:43:24.800 --> 2:43:28.880]  well i'm sure it's for overseas training sure it's dual use and then
[2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:31.360]  giggling and saying you should have told me junior
[2:43:31.360 --> 2:43:35.600]  the government without asking parents you know they put the kids in the program
[2:43:35.600 --> 2:43:39.760]  had them going back home and coming back with a list of their guns
[2:43:39.760 --> 2:43:44.080]  and you people think this military belongs to us
[2:43:44.080 --> 2:43:47.360]  it belongs to golden sacks jp morgan bank of america
[2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:50.640]  it belongs to companies that take houses they don't have deeds for and they're
[2:43:50.640 --> 2:43:55.120]  100 paid for why would the banks do that because they can
[2:43:55.120 --> 2:43:59.840]  they can they can and they will and they are
[2:43:59.840 --> 2:44:04.000]  of course they're designing GMOs to sterilize you and weaken you and make
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:07.840]  you a feminine men there's a reason women are getting
[2:44:07.840 --> 2:44:11.680]  breast cancer at off the charts rates and predominantly
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:14.880]  it's what's in the plastics as i told you a decade ago now admitted
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:17.600]  and what's designed into all the major gmo crops
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:23.920]  to feminize men what do you think those systems targeting men due to women
[2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:31.520]  they hyper feminize them so the breast accelerate their aging internally
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:35.840]  why do you get cancers in hormone-based tissues
[2:44:35.840 --> 2:44:45.920]  the ovaries the testicles the breast the prostate because hormones are highly
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:52.560]  unstable and cause cell damage that's why mammals get cancer sharks
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:57.360]  cannot get it because sharks do not have hormones
[2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:02.160]  they pump all these synthetic hormones into the food they they design it into
[2:45:02.160 --> 2:45:05.040]  all the major food crops and that's why women
[2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:09.440]  that's why beautiful good decent loving caring
[2:45:09.440 --> 2:45:13.280]  women what what men are supposed to defend
[2:45:13.280 --> 2:45:16.720]  we've got women turned into a bunch of mindless idiots the men turn into
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:19.200]  mindless idiots everybody jibbering running around an
[2:45:19.200 --> 2:45:25.120]  arrested development level of 12 years old while women you're being murdered
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:29.360]  that's why they got five year olds now and younger going into puberty
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:32.800]  our boys or little girls our women are amazons
[2:45:32.800 --> 2:45:35.840]  you know why suddenly statistics are coming out that women are within a few
[2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:38.080]  decades on average are going to be taller than men
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:40.960]  something that never happened in any skeletons they've dug up worldwide
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:45.680]  getting an anthropology women are always shorter than the men
[2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:50.240]  in fact in almost every species except maybe insects
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:58.160]  the male is bigger because the women are growing up to giant proportions now
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:03.120]  because of the hormones because i want to get into all the science of it
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:06.720]  you know it go to the mall and just look at you'll see a dad and a mom you can
[2:46:06.720 --> 2:46:10.320]  tell it's their daughters then and the daughters are a foot two feet taller
[2:46:10.320 --> 2:46:15.280]  than their parents those girls are walking dead
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:19.600]  they'll be lucky if they make it to 30 before big old tumors grow
[2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:22.160]  and then they're going to suck all the money out of those women
[2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:28.640]  to burning them up with the with the chemotherapy and the radiation are
[2:46:28.640 --> 2:46:32.880]  god i just want to stop i wanted to stop murdering us
[2:46:32.880 --> 2:46:36.640]  but but but tyranny always gets away with this stuff because people can't
[2:46:36.640 --> 2:46:39.120]  believe in evil they can't but the devil's biggest
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:43.840]  trick was he didn't exist folks please for heaven's sakes
[2:46:43.840 --> 2:46:46.880]  five-year-olds aren't supposed to be going into puberty some as young as
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:50.720]  three the age of puberty is not 13 now the us
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:54.720]  average is 10 your girls are going to die
[2:46:54.720 --> 2:46:58.080]  your boys are women
[2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:03.680]  there's a reason american men act and look like women
[2:47:06.720 --> 2:47:10.000]  there's a reason the police have to take steroids now
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:15.040]  they don't have enough testosterone to even be men
[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:18.320]  but the cops don't care on average they're going to join with this satanic
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:21.280]  system a system that hates them just like the yuppies
[2:47:21.280 --> 2:47:24.160]  are going to join with it so you know what i'm just here to let you know
[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:28.480]  you had a choice because that's how god works
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:33.120]  but we're going to beat this thing in the end with god's help okay i'm sorry
[2:47:33.120 --> 2:47:38.240]  steve you you set me off thinking about the the evil of taking our children
[2:47:38.240 --> 2:47:42.160]  and training them to line up veterans and and kill them in firing
[2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:45.520]  squads i'm sorry go ahead
[2:47:45.520 --> 2:47:50.000]  um another thing that really blew my mind this was about a year ago
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.320]  i knew you know the games up i was in athens georgia
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:47:59.680]  right there at the um university of georgia at the arches
[2:47:59.680 --> 2:48:03.200]  there's a great restaurant there i was going to well they were having an
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:09.040]  impromptu marxist socialist rally you know all the college kids
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:12.640]  that doesn't exist but but but but if you talk about communism
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:16.720]  it's a conspiracy theory it doesn't exist in their face i'm like
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:21.680]  you should be ashamed your grandfather is rolling in his grave and he got all
[2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:24.400]  up in my face and i had a hindricks shirt on
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:28.720]  they had an american flag behind it he's like you ought to be ashamed
[2:48:28.720 --> 2:48:32.400]  you're wearing a hindricks shirt and you're talking like that i'm like jimmy
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:37.360]  hindricks served you know he said you know
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:40.880]  america is great and he played a national anthem
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:44.000]  when he went to other countries he would play
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:48.320]  he said stand up for you country if not if you
[2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:53.040]  stand up for your country i'm like that's how warped they are and again and
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:56.160]  again they think communism is standing up for america
[2:48:56.160 --> 2:48:59.200]  they think having our kids turned into spies is america
[2:48:59.200 --> 2:49:05.440]  they wrap their evil around the american flag and they wrap that the american
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:09.280]  flag again and then they say we're on did you hear me read the fbi press
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:12.480]  release that if you're into silver and gold you're a terrorist and they will
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:16.480]  hunt us down and get us i mean i mean these people are
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:20.880]  open tyrants it's it's out they're even wearing black hats
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:23.920]  i mean it's like in the westerns the bad guys wearing black and a black hat
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:27.920]  they're even wearing the black hat and i've got to sit here and be told i'm
[2:49:27.920 --> 2:49:30.160]  the bad person
[2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:34.720]  punch me poke me in the chest and said i need to get out of there
[2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:38.080]  move along you're starting trouble
[2:49:38.080 --> 2:49:42.240]  yeah i've had communists openly tell me that when they take over america that
[2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:45.760]  that they're going to kill everybody and uh that they're going to kill me
[2:49:45.760 --> 2:49:49.040]  and of course they work for the bankers the big mega banks come in set up
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:52.320]  communism to rob everybody then they sit offshore and suck the money out i
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:56.560]  appreciate your call johnny and colorado hung up because he's a trooper
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:49:59.840]  and i've been babbling oh it's painful to do this show
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:03.120]  sometimes but you know what it would be more painful
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:08.880]  not to resist this again they tell you be for the military give up your rights
[2:50:08.880 --> 2:50:12.480]  the military works for us it works for the congress that we elect
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:15.680]  not the president that sends them off to war without authorization
[2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:21.520]  all of this is very simple in fact i meant to get to the star spangled banner
[2:50:21.520 --> 2:50:25.920]  excuse me national anthem excuse me i can't even think straight now
[2:50:25.920 --> 2:50:29.840]  pledge of allegiance uh where they cut out one nation under god
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:33.920]  and then cut to the military saying present arms they said well if we cut it
[2:50:33.920 --> 2:50:37.280]  out but put a military image in they won't know what to do and they'll
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:40.720]  accept getting rid of god and replacing it with the military
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:44.240]  but they don't even mean make the military god which is blasphemous
[2:50:44.240 --> 2:50:48.240]  in in the imagery in that video the media is not getting what it really means
[2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:53.040]  it's those that control the military are god it's saying all political power goes
[2:50:53.040 --> 2:50:56.720]  out of the barrel of a gun they're saying government is god
