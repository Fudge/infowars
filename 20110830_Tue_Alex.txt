[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:39.760]  Texas Alex Jones it is Tuesday the 30th day of August 2011 we're gonna be live
[00:39.760 --> 00:45.600]  here for the next three hours and we're going to have just masses of vital news
[00:45.600 --> 00:49.960]  information on the economy geopolitical developments the unfolding global
[00:49.960 --> 00:54.960]  corporate police state and your phone calls we also have some guests that
[00:54.960 --> 00:58.960]  we're working on for later in the broadcast but if they don't materialize
[00:58.960 --> 01:04.160]  that's fine with me because I have a lot of video clips a lot of news that I
[01:04.160 --> 01:13.760]  want to analyze here today now beginning just to let you know some of what's
[01:13.760 --> 01:20.640]  coming up feds may seize Liberty dollars and they have announced that to even
[01:20.640 --> 01:26.320]  have a Liberty dollar silver or gold or copper which is one of thousands of
[01:26.320 --> 01:30.840]  companies that have existed over the last few decades producing their own
[01:30.840 --> 01:36.040]  private silver and gold coins that if you have these coins and they're beta
[01:36.040 --> 01:39.480]  testing right now gold confiscation they're seeing of the public is dumb
[01:39.480 --> 01:44.440]  enough to believe carbon dioxide is poisonous or that TSA should stick their
[01:44.440 --> 01:48.440]  hands down your pants or that lemonade stands are illegal or that gardening in
[01:48.440 --> 01:56.320]  your own yard is illegal they're seeing if the public is stupid enough to think
[01:56.320 --> 02:02.160]  that this is counter fitting to issue your own silver and gold coins even
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.280]  though that's not even accepted at most stores this company operated of course
[02:06.280 --> 02:14.480]  for 14 years before being raided and earner Von Dodehouse is out in Hawaii
[02:14.480 --> 02:17.960]  right now that's why we haven't called him yet because it's so early but we may
[02:17.960 --> 02:22.640]  get him to pop in on the broadcast he's still awaiting sentencing he was found
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.960]  guilty of course a few months ago and if you read the FBI own website with a US
[02:28.960 --> 02:32.960]  attorney attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are
[02:32.960 --> 02:37.160]  simply a unique form of domestic terrorism to the US Attorney Tompkins
[02:37.160 --> 02:41.480]  all these forms of anti-government activities do not involve violence they
[02:41.480 --> 02:46.120]  are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and present danger to the
[02:46.120 --> 02:51.040]  economic stability of this country she added we are determined to meet these
[02:51.040 --> 02:55.960]  threats through infiltration disruption and dismantling of organizations would
[02:55.960 --> 03:01.240]  seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government and they
[03:01.240 --> 03:04.480]  say the same thing in manuals of course they give law enforcement about Ron
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.600]  Paul our legitimate form of government was taken over by the private Federal
[03:09.600 --> 03:13.000]  Reserve they've now bankrupted us by design or offering a new bank of the
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.400]  world is the solution you got to love the infiltration part it's not illegal to
[03:17.400 --> 03:22.320]  produce your own raw real milk but they quote infiltrate groups that are public
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.320]  and it's like saying we infiltrated a Sunday school meeting so they go to the
[03:27.320 --> 03:31.720]  jury and say we infiltrated a scunt a Sunday school meeting see we infiltrated
[03:31.720 --> 03:35.920]  their criminals we swat teamed them and most jury say hey that's it garden in
[03:35.920 --> 03:41.520]  the yard you infiltrated send them to jail lemonade sand you infiltrated send
[03:41.520 --> 03:45.500]  them to jail they're selling gold and silver for 14 years publicly you
[03:45.500 --> 03:51.040]  infiltrated send them to jail it's like the infiltrating like we're infiltrating
[03:51.040 --> 03:58.200]  we're infiltrating people that are eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches so it
[03:58.200 --> 04:04.640]  must be illegal I mean it's it's all like dress up or or theater why we
[04:04.640 --> 04:09.440]  spent a million dollars over a year infiltrating an Amish group selling milk
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.280]  to their neighbors our undercover agents were able to purchase it dozens of
[04:14.280 --> 04:17.960]  times and made friends with them made friends with people publicly selling
[04:17.960 --> 04:25.120]  milk see this is what tyranny's all about just like in the cases were my
[04:25.120 --> 04:32.400]  listeners in Tennessee Arkansas in Kentucky in the newspaper they report
[04:32.400 --> 04:36.480]  with a straight face Kelly rushing arrested for handing out videos they
[04:36.480 --> 04:41.200]  had Ron Paul and Alex Jones on them police found it anti-law enforcement
[04:41.200 --> 04:46.120]  he's facing six years in jail and then it went to trial the jury found him not
[04:46.120 --> 04:50.560]  guilty but they tried to put him in jail for something that wasn't illegal

[08:44.480 --> 08:52.040]  from around the world Israel sends to warships to the Egyptian border Israeli
[08:52.040 --> 08:57.120]  stock up on stun grenades to welcome Palestinian state uprising Tripoli tries

[09:03.600 --> 09:08.680]  that's French news agency thought I ran with the bad guys thought Al Qaeda were
[09:08.680 --> 09:15.680]  the bad guys but hmm also final battle imminent Libya rebel spokesman is saying
[09:15.680 --> 09:22.480]  rebels give Gaddafi forces four days to surrender or face military action
[09:22.480 --> 09:27.720]  Blair's sister-in-law Tony Blair sister-in-law incites Muslims to liberate
[09:27.720 --> 09:31.040]  Jerusalem where the globalists are really trying to start World War three
[09:31.040 --> 09:37.200]  right now house GOP targets the UN over Palestinians that's just some of the
[09:37.200 --> 09:42.320]  news on that front we're going to be breaking down also the White House
[09:42.320 --> 09:49.200]  issues guidelines on September 11th observances their talking points have
[09:49.200 --> 09:54.600]  been made public on keep it focused on Al Qaeda Al Qaeda still a threat and we
[09:54.600 --> 09:58.280]  need to keep the wars going and of course none of the first responders are
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.960]  allowed at the events though because here's another article today on a raw
[10:02.960 --> 10:09.240]  story Army Rangers widow booted from Rumsfeld's book signing she confronted
[10:09.240 --> 10:19.680]  him and said that he had lied about 9-11 Ashley Joppa Hagman said that her
[10:19.680 --> 10:25.200]  husband Sergeant Hagman had joined the military because he believed the lies
[10:25.200 --> 10:30.480]  Rumsfeld had told after the 9-11 attacks she was manhandled out of the
[10:30.480 --> 10:41.560]  building KCPO TV reported so that's some of the news on the 9-11 front also six
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.800]  arrested in latest San Francisco Bart protest there's more protest against the
[10:47.800 --> 10:50.840]  fact that there was gonna be another peaceful protest a few weeks ago so the
[10:50.840 --> 10:54.800]  government just turned off cell phones in a large part of the city preemptively
[10:54.800 --> 10:58.400]  I thought Hossie Mubart was bad for doing that once there was rioting and
[10:58.400 --> 11:06.040]  burning but the police say that they tolerated the protest that tolerated the
[11:06.040 --> 11:12.640]  First Amendment in that nice meaning it's up to them until there were statements
[11:12.640 --> 11:18.080]  made that were quote anti-police at least six protesters were arrested
[11:18.080 --> 11:21.800]  Monday night during the third week of protest against San Francisco Bay Area
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.920]  Transit Bart demonstrators were upset with Bart's decision to cut off cell phone
[11:25.920 --> 11:30.960]  service at its stations of thwart a planned protest and of the killing of a
[11:30.960 --> 11:35.120]  homeless man by a Bart officer two men were detained by police that were
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.480]  passing through the gates enchanting an anti-police slogan that goes on Bart
[11:39.480 --> 11:44.880]  officials officials our leaders had previously said they would only
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.920]  tolerate protest outside the gates other four were arrested by the San
[11:48.920 --> 11:52.760]  Francisco police for allegedly impeding traffic and refusing police orders to
[11:52.760 --> 12:01.600]  move and it just goes on from there we have a very important stack here
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.960]  dealing with the economy but I'll be getting into more detail on after we
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.080]  take some of your calls negative view of federal government hits new all-time
[12:12.080 --> 12:19.200]  high in Gallup poll lowest in history they do not believe the general public
[12:19.200 --> 12:24.400]  does not believe the government serves them Kusinich says Obama's jobs are
[12:24.400 --> 12:28.840]  expert at creating foreign jobs I'm glad somebody's talking about this other
[12:28.840 --> 12:33.640]  than Ron Paul Dennis Kusinich points out that most the bailout money and most
[12:33.640 --> 12:37.000]  the stimulus money ends up going to build general electric factories in
[12:37.000 --> 12:43.600]  China General Motors factories in China Brazil Eastern Europe just tens upon
[12:43.600 --> 12:48.680]  tens of billions of dollars of your tax money goes to actually pick up the
[12:48.680 --> 12:54.760]  factory stand I mean that's what I mean it's so over the top now no first
[12:54.760 --> 13:02.960]  responders at 9-11 Memorial on 9-11 all over the country thousands of articles
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.680]  about lemonade stands and Forbes ask what's the nationwide crackdown on
[13:07.680 --> 13:15.920]  lemonade stands and in garage sales and gardens because the government is a
[13:15.920 --> 13:21.920]  Soviet ties Gestapo that's shutting everything down animal ID premise
[13:21.920 --> 13:28.040]  society food safety all pointed at local independent people all these new
[13:28.040 --> 13:32.160]  agencies the rural council run by the Department of Defense and Homeland
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.320]  Security openly saying they're going to have federal spies in every rural area
[13:36.320 --> 13:40.560]  they're going to join up with boss hog and basically oppress the local
[13:40.560 --> 13:47.240]  populations I mean this thing is a full-on globalist takeover the banks
[13:47.240 --> 13:51.560]  run the Pentagon run Homeland Security and they are setting up a giant police
[13:51.560 --> 13:56.720]  state grid local threat fusion centers merging the military and police it is
[13:56.720 --> 14:01.940]  right out of every other third world despotism we've seen but with a high
[14:01.940 --> 14:07.440]  tech integration and what did I hear this morning driving in on the local
[14:07.440 --> 14:12.920]  station groveling to the system saying well yeah taxes are being raised on
[14:12.920 --> 14:19.800]  water and power and property taxes even though the housing prices are plunging
[14:19.800 --> 14:23.560]  it doesn't matter you're going to pay more on the on the property tax which we
[14:23.560 --> 14:27.880]  didn't have in this country till 60 years ago on average the Soviets had it
[14:27.880 --> 14:33.360]  feudal Europe had a property tax even if you supposedly own your property you
[14:33.360 --> 14:37.160]  had to pay the state a percentage so you don't really own it it's a rent and I
[14:37.160 --> 14:40.840]  heard them saying it's terrible that people aren't paying all their little
[14:40.840 --> 14:46.840]  taxes and things well they can't I mean you've got 11% of Texans are on a
[14:46.840 --> 14:52.320]  arrest warrant list and I heard the host and them celebrating that they're
[14:52.320 --> 14:56.920]  going to take people's houses and cars and farms and then I heard a caller call
[14:56.920 --> 15:01.080]  in and I was just listening about 10 minutes and said listen we're in a
[15:01.080 --> 15:04.920]  depression a lot of people can't pay and they're like oh shut up you scoff law
[15:04.920 --> 15:09.120]  you're going to get it and there was giggling and smirking and then they
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.520]  went to another guy and was like that's right I work for the government we're
[15:13.520 --> 15:17.320]  going to get your property and it sounded like a joke but he was serious and
[15:17.320 --> 15:23.040]  and you scoff laws are going to get it I mean it is just incredible you've got
[15:23.040 --> 15:29.560]  the group of people that are going to submit and boot lick and crony up to
[15:29.560 --> 15:33.200]  every form of oppression and for a while they're still going to get their
[15:33.200 --> 15:39.200]  paychecks and it is a collision course like two speed trains on the same track
[15:39.200 --> 15:44.040]  going 100 miles an hour each with a 200 mile collision coming and they're
[15:44.040 --> 15:47.880]  going to call that terrorism in fact I see it in the news now every day oh my
[15:47.880 --> 15:51.680]  gosh this guy filed suit against the government for not having jurisdiction
[15:51.680 --> 15:56.320]  he's a paper terrorist let's arrest him now if you try to use the courts they're
[15:56.320 --> 16:01.600]  calling it terrorism paper terrorism and you've got people that are waking up on
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.360]  one into the spectrum you've got those that are getting deeper into their
[16:05.360 --> 16:09.520]  denial and saying nope there's not a tyranny I choose to join with the system
[16:09.520 --> 16:15.800]  and then you've got those in the middle who have no idea what's going on I mean
[16:15.800 --> 16:21.480]  I listen to men talk I listen to women and they sound like addled low-grade
[16:21.480 --> 16:28.960]  morons they're just gibbering mindless idiots that can tell you every facet of
[16:28.960 --> 16:33.760]  sitcoms and dramas and sports and who think it's weird to be civically
[16:33.760 --> 16:38.160]  involved or get freaked out of your informed just like the movie idiocracy
[16:38.160 --> 16:41.800]  they think you're showing off when you try to warn them they think it's weird
[16:41.800 --> 16:46.360]  they say that's strange you're crazy you know about the three branches of
[16:46.360 --> 16:51.920]  government basic facts are seen as evil
[16:51.920 --> 16:59.040]  that's all coming up today
[17:01.080 --> 17:06.200]  but I would have to say in the polls show it the vast majority are awake I'd
[17:06.200 --> 17:14.760]  say 65 70% these polls are showing more like 80 but 50 60 70% are somewhat awake
[17:14.760 --> 17:20.800]  but they have no idea just how bad it is I have trouble even though I have all
[17:20.800 --> 17:29.440]  the facts all the documentation to believe the information that our
[17:29.440 --> 17:36.400]  conclusions have shown to be accurate it is it is hard to come to grips with the
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.640]  fact that you're under a Soviet tyranny or you're under a Nazi tyranny or you're
[17:40.640 --> 17:47.440]  under a Chycom tyranny or a Pol Potty in tyranny or a Hugo Chavez type thing
[17:47.440 --> 17:53.080]  but we're here it's on and the globalists have decided to fully commit to
[17:53.080 --> 17:59.080]  the collapse while telling everybody everything's fine and grandstanding as
[17:59.080 --> 18:05.200]  our saviors and you've got a lot of people brought up from a very young age
[18:05.200 --> 18:11.640]  to be simple-minded and be like little children and think that as long as
[18:11.640 --> 18:15.760]  they're positive about the corruption and kind of go along with it and buy into
[18:15.760 --> 18:20.400]  the denial and the cover stories that are offered for all the different forms
[18:20.400 --> 18:26.200]  of tyranny that somehow they're on a winning team and that's why a lot of
[18:26.200 --> 18:30.440]  these goody-tooth you type mindless people will giggle and smirk at you when
[18:30.440 --> 18:34.840]  you talk about serious issues because they think they can just choose to go

[26:48.920 --> 26:54.720]  schools upwards of one-third is special education and the general students are
[26:54.720 --> 26:58.840]  what the special education was in many cases 20 years ago now they're talking
[26:58.840 --> 27:05.760]  about making entire areas of school basically bubble boy allergy areas all

[27:10.320 --> 27:15.240]  wheat allergies now what do the scientists actually say on this what has
[27:15.240 --> 27:21.080]  been proven to be causing this the reason you're seeing Crohn's disease that
[27:21.080 --> 27:27.240]  didn't exist now become an epidemic and other diseases of the gut other chronic
[27:27.240 --> 27:34.200]  bowel problems that are ubiquitous now ubiquitous and killing people it's been
[27:34.200 --> 27:37.280]  directly linked in the government's own reports that we covered yesterday with
[27:37.280 --> 27:43.640]  Mike Adams to the vaccines where it causes autoimmune responses in the gut but
[27:43.640 --> 27:48.600]  also that you're eating at GMO foods that have pesticides that are grown in
[27:48.600 --> 27:53.640]  the crops the corn and many other BT crops that are fillers in most products
[27:53.640 --> 28:00.360]  where bugs eat it and die bugs eat it and die it's 1000 times the normal
[28:00.360 --> 28:06.600]  pesticide that grows in the corner on the corn type of microorganism that is on
[28:06.600 --> 28:11.440]  the outside of the corn that naturally keeps passed away so they increase it a
[28:11.440 --> 28:16.520]  thousand times you eat that and all the studies we've covered with the rats with
[28:16.520 --> 28:21.120]  the guinea pigs it's the same thing with these different crops within two to
[28:21.120 --> 28:26.560]  three generations total sterility but they can show that in a year with rats
[28:26.560 --> 28:31.640]  with humans every generation is about 20 years on average so it's just coming

[32:14.840 --> 32:19.680]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think
[32:19.680 --> 32:25.080]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the

[33:24.960 --> 33:36.760]  Alex Jones guy I beg of you on my knees on my knees from the bottom of my soul
[33:36.760 --> 33:51.280]  from the core of my heart from my very essence and being I humbly beg of you to
[33:51.280 --> 33:58.080]  check into the claims we make on this transmission to face the horror and save
[33:58.080 --> 34:02.560]  your family humans tend to muddle through things humans tend to put up with
[34:02.560 --> 34:10.520]  whatever happens to him and the globalists know that I've told you the
[34:10.520 --> 34:17.360]  story of flying up to New York I don't know six months ago to be on the view
[34:17.360 --> 34:24.320]  and other TV programs and I was in first class because I made ABC pay for it I
[34:24.320 --> 34:35.160]  was in first class and I was sitting next to one of the big bankers and by
[34:35.160 --> 34:38.080]  the time he figured out who I was as people were shaking my hand and talking
[34:38.080 --> 34:44.200]  to me he just looked over at me and he said people will muddle through
[34:44.200 --> 34:51.160]  anything you're not gonna stop anything people will put up with anything as long
[34:51.160 --> 34:58.960]  as it's done incrementally and so many of those guys give up on humanity so they
[34:58.960 --> 35:04.120]  say humanity's a bunch of idiots I'll just join with evil that that's the
[35:04.120 --> 35:10.360]  attitude I'm a winner so I'm gonna join with the dark side because the public
[35:10.360 --> 35:14.400]  even if you try to tell them the truth they don't want to hear it that's the
[35:14.400 --> 35:21.120]  line I've been told by every big corporate chief I've run into is that
[35:21.120 --> 35:29.240]  Alex the general public doesn't want to be helped and so you might as well be a
[35:29.240 --> 35:36.640]  predator well let's just say that's true which it isn't what you think is
[35:36.640 --> 35:40.800]  going to happen what you fulfill what you push becomes a self-fulfilling
[35:40.800 --> 35:45.000]  prophecy if you just give up on everything there will be a sinking to
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.800]  the bottom when you reach for the stars when you reach for the beauty when you
[35:48.800 --> 35:54.600]  reach for the honor when you reach for the good you begin to attain it and you
[35:54.600 --> 35:57.360]  set the mark in the standard there's always going to be corruption and
[35:57.360 --> 36:01.320]  problems but you recognize it and deal with it and try to keep it under
[36:01.320 --> 36:07.120]  control but when you get that attitude and give up and just say that's the way
[36:07.120 --> 36:13.760]  it is the evil doesn't just stop at the level that you personally have accepted
[36:13.760 --> 36:23.400]  and a lot of you guys try to get into evil you try to make yourself like it I
[36:23.400 --> 36:26.920]  didn't like mushrooms decades ago I made myself eat them many times now I
[36:26.920 --> 36:32.440]  love them that's that that's really what the New World Order is all about it's
[36:32.440 --> 36:37.520]  about taking tens of millions of men over the decades and finding out who
[36:37.520 --> 36:43.200]  likes to kill who likes to torture who likes to deal narcotics then you deploy
[36:43.200 --> 36:48.240]  them to key areas everything is about training people Vietnam was a
[36:48.240 --> 36:55.360]  laboratory for war Korea was a laboratory
[36:55.360 --> 37:04.240]  the Pentagon admits that Afghanistan Iraq are laboratories for war-making we
[37:04.240 --> 37:09.560]  live in a laboratory we live under a scientific dictatorship of cold-blooded
[37:09.560 --> 37:16.680]  technocrats who enjoy testing on us just like they enjoyed testing on rats when
[37:16.680 --> 37:22.240]  they were in college a dad described you know taking biology and then working in
[37:22.240 --> 37:29.880]  MD Anderson in college he worked there even in high school he talked about some
[37:29.880 --> 37:34.720]  of the scientists in there would get off on injecting the rats with cancer
[37:34.720 --> 37:38.880]  injecting them with chemicals and watching them die said quite a few of
[37:38.880 --> 37:41.560]  them he said others were there really trying to help people but there was a
[37:41.560 --> 37:44.800]  good percentage that would sit there get this crazy look on their faces they
[37:44.800 --> 37:51.560]  were injecting cancer into a rat that's the people that run things and if you
[37:51.560 --> 37:57.040]  don't understand the phenomenon of mad scientist you don't understand
[37:57.040 --> 38:04.640]  anything now they have backdoored stacking traits they tell you corn GMO
[38:04.640 --> 38:11.640]  potatoes GMO maize wheat sugar beet soybeans they tell you they have one
[38:11.640 --> 38:16.680]  trait or even five six seven eight traits they're advertising but in every
[38:16.680 --> 38:22.480]  case where they've been reverse engineered there's been other traits added to
[38:22.480 --> 38:27.560]  release chemical compounds and pharmacological crops you know you hear
[38:27.560 --> 38:32.880]  about pharmacological crops thousands of them where they're growing antibiotics
[38:32.880 --> 38:37.320]  in a corn corn's one of the best at doing this where they crush it down and
[38:37.320 --> 38:42.280]  remove and extract they don't have to create it synthetically in a big
[38:42.280 --> 38:50.120]  laboratory using generally petrochemicals they can now do it and are in
[38:50.120 --> 38:54.720]  crops all over the planet some indoors some outdoors where they can extract
[38:54.720 --> 39:01.360]  thousands of different chemicals biologicals from it but all of these
[39:01.360 --> 39:08.160]  GMO crops are pharmacological and they have been manipulated and it's the
[39:08.160 --> 39:17.040]  perfect way to poison the population the gut diseases are exploding it is
[39:17.040 --> 39:24.920]  pandemic cancer is epidemic new forms of cancer are racing through the
[39:24.920 --> 39:30.000]  population most of us are dead already have had massive portions of our lives
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.520]  shaved off that's why in the final equation I don't care if they imprison
[39:35.520 --> 39:41.400]  me torture me to death destroy my name kill me because it's so evil what
[39:41.400 --> 39:47.360]  we're facing there is no future if it is not met do you understand that the
[39:47.360 --> 39:51.800]  people that would set me up and kill me are under attack as well I feel sorry
[39:51.800 --> 39:58.080]  for them they are weak they were programmed from birth for their role in
[39:58.080 --> 40:04.440]  this evil system they have had their souls stolen perhaps they've still got
[40:04.440 --> 40:12.040]  some toehold in the world of good and can be brought back and that's who I'm
[40:12.040 --> 40:17.880]  here to reach out to to the souls of Tarsus out there are listening all I
[40:17.880 --> 40:23.520]  can do is move you to open your heart to the truth and God will knock you off
[40:23.520 --> 40:29.720]  that horse in a blinding bolt and you will arise a new creature who has sight
[40:29.720 --> 40:45.080]  whose soul can see the universe God does not look for leaders generally who are
[40:45.080 --> 40:50.480]  just little goody tissues and who've never experienced anything in their
[40:50.480 --> 40:59.240]  life God is looking for people who have served the dark side to serve him God is
[40:59.240 --> 41:08.280]  looking for people that know evil from the inside God wants to change you from
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.960]  the inside out and only through that spiritual experience will you truly be
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.080]  given the discernment
[41:20.320 --> 41:24.280]  does that mean you're going to be a perfect new creature once you've been
[41:24.280 --> 41:27.600]  changed once you've decided to open the door you're not going to find this in
[41:27.600 --> 41:32.840]  your mainline churches I'm talking about a relationship with the creator of the
[41:32.840 --> 41:44.640]  universe but do you want to take the red pill because all I'm offering is the
[41:44.640 --> 41:54.280]  truth nothing else because once you can see it is indescribable once you can
[41:54.280 --> 41:59.560]  see the manipulation and the pettiness and the spirit of the world in the eyes
[41:59.560 --> 42:07.280]  of the servants of this system it is something indescribable that you must
[42:07.280 --> 42:19.360]  experience or yourself you are not going to find fulfillment in the world not in
[42:19.360 --> 42:25.920]  race cars not in sex not in petty power you are only going to find
[42:25.920 --> 42:35.360]  fulfillment in facing reality to tuning in to the larger spectrum of life on
[42:35.360 --> 42:38.720]  this planet and I've got news I've got to get to and I want to give the numbers
[42:38.720 --> 42:51.200]  out it's just that when I spend hours every day reading Union of Concerned
[42:51.200 --> 42:57.520]  Scientists Federation of American Scientists documents in fact we'll
[42:57.520 --> 43:00.960]  blow that up and put it on screen so I can read it for listeners here's a
[43:00.960 --> 43:06.080]  statement from the Union of Concerned Scientists warrants my crew is in there
[43:06.080 --> 43:09.880]  just doing what I said to do in the last segment just search the words I say and
[43:09.880 --> 43:16.320]  prepare yourself USDA regulations would allow pharma crops to threaten food
[43:16.320 --> 43:21.320]  supply assuming proposal from the US Department of Agriculture USDA would
[43:21.320 --> 43:25.160]  place the food supply at risk from contamination by drugs and industrial
[43:25.160 --> 43:29.000]  chemicals produced in genetically engineered food crops this is for many
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.560]  years ago the USDA's proposed regulations would allow pharma food crops to be
[43:34.560 --> 43:38.720]  grown outdoors where they could contaminate crops intended for human
[43:38.720 --> 43:43.720]  consumption the USDA ignored recommendations for the ban yes I
[43:43.720 --> 43:50.480]  believe that was a decade ago these are crops that grow toxic chemicals in
[43:50.480 --> 43:57.120]  them live HIV virus other vaccines and these big companies have been caught in
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.480]  key growth belts generally under private intelligence operatives going into
[44:02.480 --> 44:06.360]  fields that have been planted and planting this in with it and the goal is
[44:06.360 --> 44:11.360]  to infect everything then there's going to be a genetic armageddon then the UN
[44:11.360 --> 44:15.760]  will emerge with its giant seed vaults they won't believe it just search UN
[44:15.760 --> 44:23.120]  seed vaults 14 global UN seed vaults when you realize the magnitude of this
[44:23.120 --> 44:31.840]  cold-blooded calculation you realize that there is nothing you can do but
[44:31.840 --> 44:36.640]  resist this why would anyone even if you're being given money and power and
[44:36.640 --> 44:43.840]  status now why would you join with something that in the near or mid-term
[44:43.840 --> 44:50.400]  five years ten years 20 years that this incremental cancer allergies deaths
[44:50.400 --> 44:58.680]  diseases degenerative diseases are going to be absolutely ubiquitous universal
[44:58.680 --> 45:04.400]  except for the insiders and there many of them say like pionca well I know the
[45:04.400 --> 45:08.400]  airborne weaponized Ebola will be released soon and I'm ready for me and my
[45:08.400 --> 45:16.680]  family to die it's sad but it's what needs to happen they are committed to
[45:16.680 --> 45:21.160]  this these are people who are like something out of another dimension
[45:21.160 --> 45:29.000]  Hades itself event horizon hellraiser full space whatever you want to call it
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.720]  out of a black hole these people seek death and destruction it is beautiful
[45:33.720 --> 45:37.600]  to them they describe it in their literature is beautiful they talk about
[45:37.600 --> 45:49.880]  suicidal nihilism they are completely turned over to death and all of us are
[45:49.880 --> 45:56.480]  under attack by this you cannot make a deal with this let's say the devil doesn't
[45:56.480 --> 46:02.720]  exist the devil does exist in the globalist mindset it's beyond anything
[46:02.720 --> 46:10.920]  as a child I could imagine as a fictitious devil engaging in the the
[46:10.920 --> 46:16.160]  assault on the human species the assault on the human genome the assault on the
[46:16.160 --> 46:31.640]  very code of humanity the poisoning the the the manipulation is the end of
[46:31.640 --> 46:36.360]  humanity it is the end of everything it is the end of who we are it is the
[46:36.360 --> 46:41.720]  complete turning over of our destiny and everything we are everything we ever
[46:41.720 --> 46:50.040]  would have been to a group of absolute psychopathic mad men who believe they
[46:50.040 --> 46:55.160]  are gods Ray Kurzweil talking about how he doesn't believe in God yet but he's
[46:55.160 --> 47:00.440]  going to become a god no ray what you're going to do is destroy everybody
[47:00.440 --> 47:07.240]  including yourself I want to play part of this cake saying in those pieces they
[47:07.240 --> 47:10.920]  talk about and I can pull up national stories as they prepare the bubble
[47:10.920 --> 47:14.280]  schools and soon it'll be a third of the school half the school in the whole
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.840]  school will live in bubbles and have to be under pharmacological control just
[47:18.840 --> 47:22.080]  to live and they'll have to go to government to be able to have a child
[47:22.080 --> 47:25.160]  they'll take your genes of you and your wife they're already announcing this and
[47:25.160 --> 47:29.520]  splice it and then they'll be able to make decisions about how to engineer that
[47:29.520 --> 47:33.000]  embryo if you're allowed to breed that's how they're going to deal with the
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.320]  population issue is they're just going to make it to where people can't have
[47:36.320 --> 47:42.680]  children let's go ahead and play that clip from a child with a food allergy
[47:42.680 --> 47:47.440]  eating at school can sometimes be scary picked the wrong snack or lunch item you
[47:47.440 --> 47:51.760]  could get hives itchy throat and even have trouble breathing an allergist tells
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.560]  our Leslie Rody managing food allergies at school is what's going around at her
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.560]  office look in any classroom and you'll likely find at least one child with a
[48:01.560 --> 48:06.040]  food allergy allergies say it's one in every 25 kids kids who could have
[48:06.040 --> 48:11.100]  life-threatening reactions if they eat a particular food today we'll do peanut
[48:11.100 --> 48:15.760]  and the tree nuts as well as milk and egg allergist dr. Pooja Varshney has been
[48:15.760 --> 48:18.960]  busy helping students who have food allergies get ready to handle their
[48:18.960 --> 48:22.600]  days at school where they may encounter what they're allergic to actually
[48:22.600 --> 48:26.280]  probably the first step is actually knowing to how to avoid the food
[48:26.280 --> 48:30.560]  allergen and really that requires a lot of personal responsibility on the part
[48:30.560 --> 48:34.760]  of the child the family and then also you know the school environment school
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.280]  personnel because this really it affects not just the kids with food allergy but
[48:38.280 --> 48:42.600]  also kids who don't have food allergy the most common food allergies milk eggs
[48:42.600 --> 48:47.720]  and peanuts followed by wheat tree nuts and soy also fish and shellfish but
[48:47.720 --> 48:51.600]  dr. Varshney says many people who think they have a food allergy likely do not
[48:51.600 --> 48:55.920]  about 25 percent of people think they have food allergy the exact number is
[48:55.920 --> 48:59.720]  probably between one and two percent of adults and four to six percent of kids
[48:59.720 --> 49:03.960]  the difference there dr. Varshney says is due to so many lab tests now that can
[49:03.960 --> 49:07.280]  lead people to believe they have a food allergy but she says they need more
[49:07.280 --> 49:11.440]  comprehensive testing and here's another myth about food allergies she says you
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.200]  actually have to ingest the food to cause serious harm so if you have
[49:16.200 --> 49:21.320]  contact with a food allergen that may cause a skin symptom it may cause hives
[49:21.320 --> 49:26.480]  or redness at the site but that's very unlikely to progress to a systemic or
[49:26.480 --> 49:30.280]  life-threatening allergic reaction there are a few exceptions to that
[49:30.280 --> 49:34.200]  according to dr. Varshney if you're allergic to fish or shellfish all you
[49:34.200 --> 49:38.080]  have to do is smell it cooking and you can have an allergic reaction read more
[49:38.080 --> 49:45.240]  of what's going around this week with this health story at kxan.com okay
[49:45.240 --> 49:52.280]  here's a headline from us today stomach diseases on the rise in the US
[49:52.280 --> 49:56.240]  complaints of the disease are on the rise in us and more and more people are
[49:56.240 --> 50:00.720]  growing ill from exposure to products containing gluten why are people getting
[50:00.720 --> 50:06.240]  sick from wheat products because most of the wheat is now GMO you see if you
[50:06.240 --> 50:14.600]  design corn or wheat where bugs can't eat it well you're a lot bigger so it
[50:14.600 --> 50:19.400]  won't kill you right away like a bug but it's gonna cause problems your body is
[50:19.400 --> 50:24.600]  gonna have an autoimmune response hey this is bad for me but no one will ever
[50:24.600 --> 50:30.240]  tell you that on the news I'm told by folks that know them that the male
[50:30.240 --> 50:32.600]  anchor on that piece is actually a listener of the show we'll say hi to
[50:32.600 --> 50:36.480]  them I'm not criticizing you guys I know you're on a short leash but you might
[50:36.480 --> 50:43.600]  just type in GMO confirmed to increase allergies I mean big medical reports
[50:43.600 --> 50:47.200]  everywhere you might want to another report actually tell folks what's
[50:47.200 --> 50:51.720]  causing this pandemic what one of the big triggers is all right we're gonna come
[50:51.720 --> 50:55.560]  right back and get into the government announcing they're gonna come after
[50:55.560 --> 51:03.960]  silver and gold attention gardeners this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update
[51:03.960 --> 51:08.360]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and
[51:08.360 --> 51:11.920]  herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth
[51:11.920 --> 51:15.440]  that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any
[51:15.440 --> 51:19.000]  soil and like conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.280]  for self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral
[51:23.280 --> 51:26.800]  uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in
[51:26.800 --> 51:30.080]  minimum time proto grow works by providing geometric keys which have the
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.360]  capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[51:33.360 --> 51:36.360]  proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with
[51:36.360 --> 51:39.880]  extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value and if you want to
[51:39.880 --> 51:43.440]  double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow
[51:43.440 --> 51:47.440]  nutritionalized superfoods with non hybrids it's now easy GCN listeners who
[51:47.440 --> 51:50.240]  want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the proto grow website at

[53:01.200 --> 53:05.200]  the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming
[53:05.200 --> 53:11.560]  hormonally balanced again I lost 20 pounds I lost 40 pounds I lost 55 pounds
[53:11.560 --> 53:17.400]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8 their secret is amberin the revolutionary
[53:17.400 --> 53:22.600]  formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally the leading cause of
[53:22.600 --> 53:26.640]  weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance until you balance your hormones
[53:26.640 --> 53:31.240]  losing weight can be practically impossible but amberin restores hormonal
[53:31.240 --> 53:35.440]  balance naturally so the weight can just fall right off even that stubborn
[53:35.440 --> 53:40.160]  belly fat plus amberin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging like hot
[53:40.160 --> 53:44.800]  flashes night sweats low libido difficulty concentrating and more be one

[53:56.680 --> 54:12.680]  well I'm not the kind to kiss and tell but I've been seen with Farrah I've
[54:12.680 --> 54:20.040]  never been with anything less than a nine so fine I've been on fire with Sally
[54:20.040 --> 54:27.120]  feel gone fast with a girl named boat you know it's very painful to watch our
[54:27.120 --> 54:34.320]  young children turned over to the global exterminist the Nazis went too fast
[54:34.320 --> 54:39.440]  according to the transhumanist and eugenicist and that's why they all the
[54:39.440 --> 54:46.440]  succulent others wrote in the 50s that they would simply engineer that the
[54:46.440 --> 54:53.720]  systems into the food into the water and after the fluoride the bisphenol a the
[54:53.720 --> 54:59.160]  GMO the radioactive isotopes that the government adds to the water there's a
[54:59.160 --> 55:02.880]  reason the land of the free home of the brave is now land of the cowards home
[55:02.880 --> 55:06.640]  of the slaves there's a reason people act like they're mentally retarded
[55:06.640 --> 55:10.760]  there's a reason people act days and look unhealthy even if the exercise
[55:10.760 --> 55:17.120]  constantly it's because you're being savaged by a chemical biological warfare
[55:17.120 --> 55:21.360]  operation and as Dr. Nick baggage has pointed out that's only part of it then
[55:21.360 --> 55:25.200]  there's the frequency pollution they now admit oh yeah cell phones will give you
[55:25.200 --> 55:28.840]  brain cancer but we told you that after you'd been using them for 20 years and
[55:28.840 --> 55:38.760]  had addicted yourself to them now give your kids a cell phone it is a savage
[55:38.760 --> 55:43.560]  program but when you study the elites they will not use cell phones they all
[55:43.560 --> 55:49.320]  live in rural areas outside cities they all are obsessed with organic food and
[55:49.320 --> 55:52.920]  have private jets following them around with their own chefs and tightly
[55:52.920 --> 55:57.840]  controlled food they go do special cleansing programs they know exactly
[55:57.840 --> 56:02.560]  what they're doing notice Glenn Beck is not moving to inside Dallas he's moving
[56:02.560 --> 56:07.920]  to between Austin and Dallas to a fortified compound in the woods I've
[56:07.920 --> 56:13.200]  done the same thing yeah he knows what's going on I have some comments on
[56:13.200 --> 56:17.360]  Glenn Beck later I got some more intel on exactly what he's planning he's gonna
[56:17.360 --> 56:21.960]  have like a TV network based out of Dallas that's gonna be kind of
[56:21.960 --> 56:25.840]  Christianoid that's where all the big TV preachers are based for most of them
[56:25.840 --> 56:30.240]  it's gonna be that same model it's gonna be a weird Christianoid kind of Robert
[56:30.240 --> 56:36.560]  Robert Tilton type deal with lots of end-of-the-world type things and other
[56:36.560 --> 56:42.280]  stuff going on so that's the that's the model he's gonna go along with you know
[56:42.280 --> 56:48.040]  people that are saying the world's gonna end all the time the the the atheists
[56:48.040 --> 56:51.980]  even believe in 2012 a lot of them and the mainline government-run Christians
[56:51.980 --> 56:55.120]  think the end of the world's next week it's all about thinking the end of the
[56:55.120 --> 56:59.240]  world's here so you'll lay down and not be involved so you'll lay down and not
[56:59.240 --> 57:03.640]  be informed so you'll think all the history's over anyways so I might not
[57:03.640 --> 57:07.960]  you know even get involved to defend my own family they're giving you a
[57:07.960 --> 57:12.640]  defeatist attitude what a Tokyo Rose say even as the United States approach the
[57:12.640 --> 57:17.360]  coast of bombed out Japan she would broadcast on the shortwave and on the
[57:17.360 --> 57:24.400]  AM to the ships playing American music and saying I'm so sorry for you GI your
[57:24.400 --> 57:29.640]  armies have all been defeated your ships have all been sunk we're waiting for you
[57:29.640 --> 57:35.600]  to kill you in Japan there's no way you can win GI it's all over your sweetheart
[57:35.600 --> 57:42.200]  will never see you again and so they had Thundar the barbarian back in the 80s
[57:42.200 --> 57:45.880]  and all these other countless movies and shows since then about the end of the
[57:45.880 --> 57:51.000]  world and the preachers telling you and Israel's gonna get nuked and World War
[57:51.000 --> 57:56.240]  3 is gonna happen and it's all over so so why should you be involved in common
[57:56.240 --> 58:01.180]  Elina and Nabooru and Planet X so they never arrive on time meanwhile the
[58:01.180 --> 58:05.800]  Armageddon the Holocaust is in your food and your water meanwhile the globalist
[58:05.800 --> 58:08.840]  are going ahead with their world government poisoning and murdering and
[58:08.840 --> 58:12.080]  killing but the group that should be fighting the Christians are saying it's
[58:12.080 --> 58:16.520]  the end praise God they're pushing for chips and kids in school that means
[58:16.520 --> 58:23.960]  Jesus is about to come back soon will be teleported off the face of the earth
[58:23.960 --> 58:28.520]  justice be done may the heavens fall do you think if you believe all that that
[58:28.520 --> 58:34.880]  God's gonna take you into his bosom when you wouldn't stand up against evil here
[58:34.880 --> 58:40.200]  most of you mainline Christians are going straight to Hades

[59:52.880 --> 01:00:00.600]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:31.880]  Alex Jones by the way the CEO of Gibson guitar is joining us and I saw an
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:37.560]  article that dovetails with this we've now learned even if you buy legal
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.440]  endangered wood from the Forest Council or others that confirm that it's
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.520]  indigenous people making the money and that it was a tree that fell over as
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.760]  Gibson does because you know they need it for the fingerboards even if you do
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:57.280]  that it's illegal under agenda 21 and what the Lacey Act this is a mainstream
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.040]  news if American workers work the wood see everything's written where you can't
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.280]  have a job that's how they're economically through economic warfare
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.120]  bringing us down and here's the articles right here government says wood is
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.160]  illegal if u.s. workers produce it this is from Gibson comm they finally been
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:24.880]  told why they were rated so producing your own wood or working in Americans
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:30.760]  or this is mercantilism one big reason we had 1776 is we were not allowed to have
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.040]  any finished goods produced in the in the colonies it can only be sent to
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.560]  England to have that done the new England is China where the globalist have
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.280]  deals with the Communist Chinese that only their mega factories can operate
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.760]  you can go to them and order something you want have them produce it but you
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.040]  got to get it from them just like you got to be an insider to run your power
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.720]  plant you've got to be an insider to not have to buy the insurance the health
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.920]  insurance and this is mafia government so there you have it also Gibson guitar
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:05.240]  CEO raid by feds to cost company two to three million feds raid Gibson guitar
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:11.680]  factory overprotected wood wall street journal CEO of Gibson guitars main
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:18.320]  competitor is a huge Democratic donor we're gonna be talking with the CEO of
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.800]  Gibson coming up now I haven't even gotten into our top story yet we're
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:29.400]  gonna get Mr. Vaughn at no tells on as soon as we can he's facing Senate sing
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:34.600]  and he's facing decades in prison for publicly issuing his own gold and
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:40.680]  silver coins or rounds and of course he set up the Hawaiian men I remember
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:45.960]  watching as a child on TV with commemorative coins there are thousands
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:51.200]  of companies that have come and gone hundreds operating currently in fact I
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.680]  know Midas Resources sells Lakota rounds I know seven states now have moved to
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:02.320]  pass laws to issue their own silver rounds I know Midas commissioned a
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:09.600]  Liberty Committee campaign for Liberty a little gold coin I mean it's everybody
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.840]  does that there's even the Associated Press when they when they convicted
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:18.480]  Notehouse I don't know three or four months ago did their own analysis and
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.200]  said this is really scary there's hundreds of these companies and he
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.680]  wasn't operating as if this was US currency he was saying you should create
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:33.080]  your own independent currencies which are what credit cards could be called or
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:39.000]  or what customer loyalty cards or or or when you go to a Chuck E cheese or
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.280]  something and get the card that puts the credits on it I mean there's all sorts
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.960]  of coupon programs that's all an alternative currency and this there's a
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.880]  bunch of cities that have got multi hundred year old currencies here in the
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.600]  US and even AP said this counterfeiting clause they used this jury didn't know
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:58.800]  what they were doing no the jury knew full well what they were doing they knew
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:09.680]  full well that 98% now was 97 last year now they're reporting 98% of people
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.920]  charged by feds are found not guilty or you're found guilty see my brain can't
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:19.600]  even believe that number 98% of those that go to federal court you can pull
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:27.640]  these numbers up are found guilty and that's because the federal juries are
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:32.240]  kept they're selected they're picked and then they're kept and they and they
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.380]  will they will send a ham sandwich to the gas chamber for blowing up the
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:44.200]  Hindenburg blimp I mean they will they will send a M&M to the gas chamber

[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:33.320]  and the Lacey act they actually quote agenda 21 it doesn't matter if the wood
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:39.840]  is a legal non endangered wood certified because it was imported from India
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:46.800]  under the UN law the United States is not allowed to work the wood because under
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:52.280]  agenda 21 we have to abide by foreign countries laws you heard me right and it
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.640]  dovetails with this report we've it and have the video clip up at info wars.com

[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:37.000]  companies no insurance needed for their employees close to five billion dollars
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.640]  of the General Motors bailout the 25 billion total five billion of that or
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:47.760]  right at five billion was used to move major factories to Brazil Eastern Europe
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:54.440]  and China your tax money you heard me right paid to move the factories you're

[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.760]  Declaration is exactly what we're experiencing in the 13 colonies you
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.480]  were not allowed to have finished goods under tax laws you had to ship raw
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:58.440]  material to England for it to be a finished good that is one of the biggest
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.880]  reasons there were rebellions then they started having the red coats and the
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:08.240]  regional governor's militia start searching people's persons and start
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:14.200]  searching people's wives and that's when the shooting started you understand

[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:26.640]  we've got to stand down for America everything the government's doing is
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:32.120]  completely alien to the spirit of 1776 and illegal and unconstitutional but
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:38.880]  here's Dennis Cassinich breaking down that Jeffrey Emmett has used bailout
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:45.560]  money stimulus money to move the entire x-ray division one of the few industries
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:51.200]  we had left was x-ray production out of the US General Electric to China cars
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:57.040]  being moved out everything now let's get this straight these aren't companies
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:03.880]  just getting tax incentives to move they're being paid your money to leave
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:09.640]  he has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hitherto swarms of
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:15.520]  officers to harass our people and to eat out their substance I got the quote
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.720]  almost exactly right he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.200]  without the consent of our legislatures they federalize the National Guard three
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.320]  years ago and what did the John Warner Defense Authorization Act say actually
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:34.440]  four years ago it said chillingly that the military and the new guard will be
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:39.360]  used in case of insurrection or rebellion including by the governors and
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.320]  then Bush established the governor's council he doesn't listen to the
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.800]  governors themselves and the states they have a 10 member board appointed by
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:52.000]  the president Obama continued it they have a rural council that speaks for
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.200]  your town your county and is run by the Department of Homeland Security oh man
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:02.800]  but see it's red dawn but they're wearing our uniforms it's red dawn but
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.880]  they come out and say it they're here to help it's red dawn in slow motion but
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:14.760]  it's bankers who release the communist to collectivize and wreck the system then
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:22.200]  they roll in after it communism always leads to fascism in Russia in China
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:26.600]  everywhere it's practice that's why ten years ago the Chinese president said
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:34.280]  China China's communism is the greatest expression of capitalism people said
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:39.360]  that's an oxymoron why did the it was in BBC why it was a video clip why did he
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.520]  say that it makes no sense communism Chinese communism is the greatest
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:50.560]  expression of capitalism it is Bankster capitalism is collectivist command and
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:57.320]  control from the top non-free market monopoly competition is a sin as the
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:02.200]  head Rockefeller said over a hundred years ago if you tried to set up your
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:06.560]  own gold mine or your own oil field on your own property he would pull up with
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.440]  Pinkerton troops and he had the governor bought they did this from New
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:17.200]  Jersey to Colorado pull up Pinkerton massacre Colorado the train would pull
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.160]  up they've wrought off on their horses they'd set up their machine guns before
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.880]  that they're Gatlin guns and they would go into towns and murder every woman
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.400]  and child and to scare the next town they'd line little kids up cock that
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.560]  pistol and blow their brains out
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:44.920]  we're gonna get it what the 1920s there were cases of US military wanting
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.400]  their pensions they just sent out the army the machine gun them down ride them
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.760]  over with horses there were cases you pull up what New Jersey where there'd
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.880]  be a Rockefeller plant people protesting they just send in private
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:05.160]  security and slaughter everybody you listen all that's coming back to America
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.560]  but the Rockefeller said we hate these Americans scum they've beat us and they
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.160]  were beaten so the Rockefeller started acting nice and putting on all this PR
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.640]  about how they were good they made their money tax-free and they said we're gonna
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.680]  hit their vaccines we're gonna hit their food we're gonna hit their water
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.480]  we're gonna get these Americans are number one enemy and they've gotten you
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:31.840]  good they've gotten me good now haven't they they they think you're so caught up
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.840]  in their trance that they've got you what's the snakes name in the jungle
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:43.040]  book what's the snakes name he sits there hypnotizes people cock can you

[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:12.000]  Ludlow massacre was an attack by the Colorado National Guard on the 10th
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.320]  colony of 1200 and I know Pinkerton was involved in that or some of the others
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.440]  it all goes back to memory massacre was an attack on the Colorado National by
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:26.160]  the Colorado National Guard on a tent colony of 1200 striking coal miners and
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.560]  their families that may not be the one in Colorado there's another one where
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.480]  they're running them out of a town on April 20th 1914 the deaths occurred
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.920]  after a day long fight between strikers and the guard the massacre result in the
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:42.960]  violent deaths between 1925 people sources vary but all sources include two
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:48.040]  women and 11 children affixiated and burned to death under a single tent
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:54.280]  Ludlow was the deadliest incident in the southern Colorado coal strike yeah
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:59.240]  there were a bunch of them control F Pinkerton I know they were involved in
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.160]  some of those Colorado ops just control F Pinkerton and it'll pop up if it's in

[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:34.240]  okay let me break this down for you the feds have come out and said it is
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:39.920]  illegal to own Gibson guitars that were made previously they're saying they may
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.560]  swat team your own people are having them taken and are being fined when they
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.720]  try to fly out of the US that's in the Wall Street Journal this is the new
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:52.120]  American and they're saying next it's furniture guns they don't care if it's
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:56.040]  a hundred years old or older if you don't have the proof of where the wood
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.560]  came from just like ivory your guns your furniture are gone how do you think the
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.560]  crooks are gonna get in your house or business oh by the way the feds are now
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:10.000]  announcing they may go after regular silver and gold they confiscated at
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.240]  1933 you see and we only told you this could happen and they're test ballooning
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:21.320]  it right now but this case why because if they keep deflating the currency
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:25.560]  devaluing it gold could be 20,000 an ounce I mean it was 50 million
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:32.800]  Deutsch marks for a Wiener Stutzel sandwich or a loaf of bread in Weimar
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.880]  Republic Germany same thing in Zimbabwe same thing in Argentina you know they
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.840]  only had thousand percent inflation there you know not not million
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:46.680]  inflation and but but that that's why now the bankers all hoard theirs offshore
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:53.680]  as a reason Hugo Chavez has ordered his gold back from England the 144 tons they
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.080]  had there another 60 something tons and other European vaults but again that's
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.280]  even more reason to get gold don't don't turn it in when they say it they'll
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:05.280]  arrest a few people on TV and have SWAT teams call them terrorists by the way
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:09.400]  let me read from the FBI's website attempts to undermine the legitimate
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.640]  currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism US
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.880]  attorney Tom could shed an announcement the verdict all these forms of anti
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:23.480]  government activities do not involve violence there every bit is insidious to
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.400]  publicly have TV ads on selling gold and silver coins totally legal even the
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.120]  AP admitted this is legal and represent a clear and present danger to the
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:34.440]  economics stability of this country she added we are determined to meet these
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:39.320]  threats through infiltration disruption and dismantling of organizations with
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:44.800]  seek to challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government that's the
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:49.400]  article that's me sees Liberty dollars and they've put out a release saying no

[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:30.120]  they're using Mexican troops associated press inside the US not even a news
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:39.520]  issue this is what America has turned into and and the FBI and the US
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:48.400]  attorneys are with a straight face saying that silver and gold is
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:51.880]  undermining the United States I thought it was the Federal Reserve that took
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.640]  over in 1913 and is now fully bankrupt in this country you know the folks that
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.800]  got tens of trillions of dollars of tax money and tried to keep it secret I
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:05.000]  thought they were the ones the value of the dollar I'm sorry it's not even a
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.560]  dollar it's a Federal Reserve note and then it's undermining our democratic
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:15.640]  process the FBI and US Attorney's Office these are the people this is the
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:21.320]  Justice Department that ships guns all over the country I saw a US attorney on
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.360]  tape just last week in federal court griping about it saying we're not allowed
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.360]  to go after people now unless they have it with something like 50 kilos they
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.760]  only go after drugs at the retail level because you're a good worker to work for
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:40.600]  25 cents an hour in a prison displacing everybody else's jobs they don't just
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.120]  get rid of our jobs with China or labor from Mexico they get rid of it with the
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.760]  millions of prisoners building everything you can imagine doing customer
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:56.400]  service everything this is America this is what America is you don't make a
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.160]  wooden guitar even if the wood isn't endangered because under a UN law you're
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:10.600]  not allowed to work the wood I want you to understand ladies and gentlemen this
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:15.400]  is only the beginning of how our emperor government has erected a multitude of
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:21.680]  offices and sent forth swarms of agents to oppress our people and eat out their
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.200]  substance declaration of independence that's why America was admired why it
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:31.120]  was loved why it was known for being the freest country in the world now the dark
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.800]  light of tyranny shines forth from our country because we've let criminal
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:41.200]  hardcore mafia take over who say listen you don't have a business and let's we

[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:25.560]  engaged in fine craftsmanship and that of course is Gibson guitar I know a lot
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:31.560]  of my friends and family dearly love and their classic Les Pauls and they've been
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:36.160]  rated a few years ago won't tell them why I've been rated again and now they're
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.640]  learning it doesn't matter if they get the wood legally or lawfully now the
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:44.720]  police are saying hey we may start rating musicians homes we when you try to
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.040]  travel out of the country doesn't matter if it's a 50 year old guitar they're
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:52.400]  taking it but not just Gibson's now they're talking about guns with the wood
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.720]  that's on them if you can't prove that's not some endangered wood from a
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:35:02.280]  foreign country it's gone your furniture the whole police state system wants to
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:06.040]  expand you've seen the green police ads on TV where they're arresting folks for
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:10.800]  light bulbs actually in Australia they do home inspections and are talking about
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.880]  arresting people if you've got a crack in your window this is the total takeover
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:22.560]  of society and Henry Jeskowitz is the CEO of Gibson and here's one of their
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:31.000]  press releases Gibson says wood is illegal if US workers produce it a
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.200]  continuing air guitar frets environmental enforcement leaves musicians in
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:46.320]  fear I saw an Atlantic article where they had the headline how do you turn
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:51.160]  musicians in a tea part of the tea part of yours take their guitars Gibson
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:56.200]  guitar CEO raid by feds to cost company two to three million dollars here's
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:02.800]  another one breaking it down CEO of Gibson guitar or Republican donor
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:08.480]  Democrat competitor uses same wood just like Obama's contributors are exempt
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:14.760]  from having to have the government-run health care which is an unfair trade
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.040]  advantage just like general electrics power plants are exempt from the new
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:29.080]  carbon taxes joining us again is the CEO and I appreciate him coming on Mr.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:34.560]  Jeskowitz thank you for coming on today thank you very much for having me well
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:38.200]  so much has happened I saw your press conference and it seems like you're
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:44.360]  really informed you've got the floor tell us exactly what's happened well it
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:51.800]  was a normal day and you know it started normally we were producing guitars and
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:59.720]  you know very early in the morning we had something like 20 to 30 armed swat
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:05.560]  like agents descend on three of our manufacturing plants in our corporate
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:12.160]  headquarters they evacuated all the employees several hundred people
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:18.120]  respectively into parking lots and streets shut down the manufacturing
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:25.800]  facilities started pouring through them confiscating raw materials in the
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:33.880]  manufacturing facilities paperwork started grabbing some hard drives copying
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:41.560]  imaging hard drives and generally shutting down our business do you think
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:48.000]  that this could be political sabotage or espionage because it's been confirmed
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.040]  that General Motors franchises in Minnesota and other areas when they
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.640]  nationalize General Motors that people that weren't Democratic Party donors
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:04.040]  that they had their franchise taken away and given to others you heard me sir
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:08.400]  just mentioned the fact that 2,000 plus big companies that are donors have been
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.600]  given government healthcare waivers we know General Motors has also gotten
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:21.000]  government bailout money the same thing with us General Electric I mean do you
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.920]  think that some of that could be a play here I really don't know I'd hate to say
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:34.200]  anything without any you know specific knowledge but I will say that we are not
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.080]  the only company that is buying Indian Rosewood and Ebony which is the issue
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:45.560]  here other competitor companies are indeed buying it and have not been in
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:54.800]  any way impacted contacted or otherwise harassed so the fact that we are
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:02.680]  uniquely selected that definitely makes me suspicious as to why that's the case
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:08.000]  now I noticed in your press conference you talked about some of the acts that
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.120]  sign us on to basically a gender 21 international law and that under the
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.640]  Lacey Act and other things that even if foreign countries change laws
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:24.120]  retroactively now you're under that and that specifically they don't like us
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:30.760]  buying wood from foreign countries and then working it right that's that the
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:36.760]  real irony I mean we have an outstanding American labor force we have been
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:42.640]  hiring people at the very you know depths of the economic problems we we have
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:52.880]  hired over 580 American workers new jobs we are very successful at exporting
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:59.200]  products 60% of our product goes overseas these these are things that
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.600]  normally you know countries get pretty excited about and you're considered a
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:11.080]  pretty good guy and a good citizen when when you cause that to happen the fact
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:17.320]  is the government's position is that it's not about the wood and illegal
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:24.200]  logging it's about the labor content in the wood and the government apparently
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:33.400]  prefers that that labor content be outside the United States just kind of
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:39.920]  a bizarre thing again we're talking to the CEO of Gibson guitar sir even
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:43.680]  congressman Dennis Cassinich on CNN last night pointed out that the head of
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.600]  the president's economic council the former head of General Electric is
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:53.440]  actually getting incentives to move General Electric's x-ray division out
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.400]  of the US as I said three of our factories were paid for with the bail
[01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:04.520]  out of General Motors to move them to Eastern Europe China and Brazil so that
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:08.560]  is undoubtedly what's happening the congressman has the headline here
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:16.600]  Obama's jobs are expert at creating foreign jobs can you speak to that well
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:24.760]  all I can say is that this is costing us money is making us less competitive and
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:32.480]  it will certainly impact you know jobs here in the United States and it's
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:41.440]  really making me question whether we're valued you know in the US well don't
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:44.840]  let him win sir don't let him run you out to China because then you've got to go
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:49.240]  through one of the Chinese generals and that's why the big cats fat cats did
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:54.200]  this deal decades ago with China they admit it or only select operations are
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:58.120]  allowed to move there certainly you could move to Mexico or or somewhere else
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:01.520]  but I think once you're in their sights they're going to keep coming after you I
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.680]  think it's up to the American people if they want any industry or craftsmanship
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:11.400]  left in this country to come to your aid what can we do to to help Gibson
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:17.720]  guitar stay open and stay in the United States well we're hoping that people
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:22.960]  call their congressman their senators that their politicians and let them
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:29.200]  know that this is not fair and not right and to do whatever they can not only to
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:35.080]  address the problem we have is as Gibson but I think it's a nation wide
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:43.000]  problem where we need to address this much broader than just our individual
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.280]  situation this is happening with other companies in various areas where
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:57.040]  regulation is creeping in and being applied irrationally and hostily and I
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:02.600]  think that needs to be put an end to I think we need to look at what is good
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:08.880]  for our nation what it's good for our people and our workers sir in 1984 a
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.960]  fictitious nightmare police-state scenario Winston doesn't know what he's
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:21.320]  being accused of and of course in the famous novel that Kafka wrote and we
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:26.080]  get the term Kafka asked because in the end he's convicted of a crime and
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.680]  sentenced to death and doesn't even know why he was sentenced to death and more
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.160]  and more we're seeing that people are being sentenced and never even finding
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.960]  out it's just they're told national security and I know you were rated a
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:42.240]  few years ago you've been rated again and you can't even find out when you
[01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:46.720]  talk to them why you're being rated I mean in the Constitution you have a
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.040]  ability to know what you're being charged with and to face your accuser
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:59.360]  that's right and it's pretty bizarre to be in our predicament you know not
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:04.600]  much I can say except it's a nightmare we're talking to Henry
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:10.680]  Jeskowitz the CEO of Gibson guitar and of course you can go to Gibson.com and
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.480]  sell the latest press releases sir I want to instead of you know sitting here
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:18.800]  asking you questions I'd like to give you the floor because in the press
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.120]  conference I saw a lot of media there but the audio wasn't too good on the
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:27.040]  YouTube version so I'd like to give you the floor here you know to really speak
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:31.760]  about what you think is most important I would also like to ask you about the
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:35.120]  armed nature of it how you were treated like you were criminals instead of
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:40.400]  working with our industry and saying hey you know you might do this a little
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.920]  bit better but I noticed that with the vitamin industry they tried that and
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:48.640]  now the government's trying to shut them down so unfortunately they don't want
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:52.360]  to work with you and even if you try they're gonna come after you these are
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:56.600]  parasites who could care less about our economy or our future but but but you've
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:02.080]  got the floor sir well I think I think you're a lot more eloquent than I am and
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:09.120]  and you know all I can say is that that in fact the government is using you
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:16.160]  know drug enforcement hostile tech techniques we are just a guitar factory
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:25.880]  we're a small business that's very successful we're hiring people we are
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:32.480]  competing successfully overseas and exporting and we're talking about you
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:41.400]  know an import at export paperwork issue that should not you know be dealt
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:50.600]  with with people with loaded guns and bulletproof vests intimidation techniques
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:58.040]  we've had hourly employees put into rooms with five or six armed people and
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:03.760]  interrogated without their attorney present you know you're talking about
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:10.520]  really hostile action and no one has come to us and said fellas you know
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:16.880]  here's the problem we have an issue with this let's deal with it their first
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:24.600]  response was SWAT raids with guns and they shut our business down they
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:34.280]  injured us it was an attack and we have no recourse you know there there isn't
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:41.480]  even a judicial recourse we are trying to fight this in court and the
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:47.000]  government is trying to stay the judicial proceeding so that we can't even
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.320]  fight and get our day in court so anyway I think we are being treated
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:47:02.160]  unfairly way disproportionate to any possible cause I think that their
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:08.880]  ability to do that really we have to think about what that means for our
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.840]  democracy and for for other people who could be put in this exact same
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:24.040]  situation and so you know I asked for for reason and I asked for fairness well
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:28.840]  you're not going to get that from the federal Gestapo anymore they admit they
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:32.440]  want to post industrial United States that's with the whole green tyranny
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.920]  carbon taxes about only their friends are going to be able to operate now in
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:42.760]  America Al Gore has said it they've all stated it and this is there this is
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:46.880]  their program this is the mafia takeover of America we're talking to Henry
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:53.960]  just go it's the CEO of Gibson guitar a growing American company 60%
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:57.960]  foreign I know Gibson gets more and more popular they have an entertainment
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.360]  office here in Austin they're bucking the trend with American craftsmanship
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:10.360]  just like Harvey Harley Davidson and others and the system does not like
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:14.960]  this and they harass every major American company that is left it's on an
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:18.720]  insider but sir you brought up something that's the heart of the matter we've
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:23.360]  seen raids on dairy farms that sell raw milk to Whole Foods and people legally
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:26.640]  and rock raw milk cheese and they do the same thing they show them say we're
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.120]  going to say all your cows have mad cow and kill all of them unless you sign a
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:33.920]  form admitting you did something illegal they just make it up or they show up to
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:37.520]  Amish and he literally put guns to their heads and scream and cuss and say
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:43.560]  admit you're guilty I mean they're worse than Gestapo I mean the Gestapo
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:48.400]  were polite till they got you to a camp the ATF had just resigned caught
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:52.640]  shipping guns into Mexico then blame the Second Amendment here caught
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:56.000]  perjuring himself turns out the White House ordered it I think we've got to
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.160]  come to grips with these are really nasty people or they're going to continue
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.320]  to have the moral high ground but you mentioned that they got employees in
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:09.520]  there without their lawyers and began these interrogations that is unconstitutional
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.080]  that is official oppression that is illegal and I hope that you look to get
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:18.680]  on the offensive with a civil suit against these people and that
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:24.400]  organizations come to your aid sir we are looking for every legal remedy and
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.880]  you know and we'll go to Supreme Court if we have to well I want to say this we
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:34.800]  all hang together we hang separate you know who said that Benjamin Franklin
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:40.080]  you yeah you know one of our founding fathers and I don't think our founding
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:46.240]  fathers had this in mind for their democracy well our republic is in deep
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:49.280]  trouble sir we're going to break her in a moment we'll come back to five more

[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:24.560]  that several of these people in in subsequent interrogations by the Justice

[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.040]  and until you will still my heart I'll hide
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:24.040]  Henry Juskowitz the CEO of Gibson guitar with two factories right there in Tennessee and
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:28.040]  offices all over the United States and larger cities like right here in Austin
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:33.040]  Texas I've got friends that have been over to the little showroom and bought a
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:38.040]  guitar that's almost as bad as people getting arrested for selling lemonade all
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:44.040]  over the country for ten cents a glass or gardens being banned in people's
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:49.040]  yards up in up in Michigan sir I want to warn you and I'm sure your lawyers have
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:54.040]  already warned you the feds are 98% of the time they convict whoever they go
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:59.040]  ahead and charge that's because they have kept basically Soviet style juries
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:05.040]  that will send a ham sandwich to the gas chamber in order to do so but but public
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.040]  pressure has been known to back them off from the charges and as you said in the
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:12.040]  first few days they wouldn't tell you why now they're saying the Lacey Act
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:17.040]  international law it's that your laborers were working the wood and they can
[01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:21.040]  change these international laws anytime they want and then say well the laws have
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:25.040]  changed now now you're under it but the fact that they're going after factory
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:31.040]  floor craftsmen and women shows that they're just trying to terrorize them to
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:36.040]  lie about you and they'll say we're going to let you off now just say this and
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:41.040]  they'll convince them then they'll go in and testify and so you are in grave
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:46.040]  fear everybody's gotta gotta get the word out about this what's your take on that
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:54.040]  well that may very well be the fact I mean they are being threatened and
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:56:02.040]  coercive techniques were were used and fortunately you know we have good people
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:10.040]  here at Gibson and everyone here is you know really feels terrible about this
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:16.040]  we all love the company we've done nothing wrong and the intimidation isn't
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:21.040]  working by the way I mean these floor workers I mean they have nothing to do
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:25.040]  with the importation and working of it everybody knows they're totally innocent
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:31.040]  that you know that's that's right I mean I'm the head guy of the company if they
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:36.040]  if they want to come after someone they should come after management and you
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:43.040]  know it just really sent chills down my spine for them to go after you know normal
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:48.040]  people that you know don't deal with lawyers and they don't have a squad of
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:53.040]  legal people and in fact you know the company didn't have to support those
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:57:00.040]  people they could have been on their own you know if we did support them we
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:06.040]  hired independent lawyers for them to protect their own personal interest but
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:11.040]  that didn't have to happen it's just not right and by the way this fishing
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:18.040]  expedition is now going into its third year this started in 2009 yes sir
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:23.040]  Wow I mean I see it all the time where they throw the book at somebody who gets
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:27.040]  a drop of motor oil in their backyard but then we're shipping all our jobs to
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:30.040]  China where they just dump the toxic waste right in the ocean I mean how is
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:35.040]  America supposed to operate with these all these new offices that have been
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:39.040]  erected and the swarms of agents that have been sent out to eat out our
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:49.040]  substance it's very difficult to do business with these issues facing you
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:53.040]  now have you seen an upswing in orders though with the people sympathetically
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:58:00.040]  trying to support American jobs a lot of people have been calling in yes we have
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:06.040]  seen an upswing in orders of course it's only been a couple of days since the raid
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:12.040]  but that people are just pouring letters and support in from all over the
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:18.040]  country and all over the world and yes we have seen an uptick in people buying
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:23.040]  product so they certainly realized that it's important to have jobs here in
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:28.040]  America and and in closing sir they're claiming that it's because you were
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:34.040]  working the wood that it's able to have jobs here essentially that's right you
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:37.040]  know what we're going to break for one minute I just want you to finish that

[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:53.040]  more into feds are now saying people that print up their own silver gold coins

[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:06.040]  and even the associate press says but this isn't illegal the government is
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:13.040]  out of control and they're expanding into raw milk and guitars and wood and
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:20.040]  everything else we're talking to the CEO of Gibson guitar Henry Jeskowitz and
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:24.040]  I got to say sir I admire you for staying in America even though you could
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:30.040]  undoubtedly make giant profits overseas I want to commend you on keeping the
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:35.040]  quality of the lot of musicians they say it's the best and I want to commend you
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.040]  for saying hey you want to come after somebody government come after me not
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.040]  somebody that sweeps the floors not somebody that carves the wood or puts
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:49.040]  the guitar strings on this is so cowardly and dastardly that they're going
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:54.040]  after and threatening and intimidating with their guns your people to try to get
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:58.040]  them to make something up about you it just shows how wicked these folks are
[02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:02.040]  so I want to commend you thank you very much and thank you for having me on
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:08.040]  the show and giving us some time well I'll tell you right now I intend to buy a
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:12.040]  Gibson guitar because if they who knows they might win they might shut you down
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:17.040]  it's a collector's item but I'm you know I'm friends with Jimmy Vaughan I know
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:21.040]  he's involved with other guitars but I know a lot of musicians and I think all
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:26.040]  of them need to stand up together or as I said hang separate because I've read in
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:29.040]  the news Wall Street Journal admits people with the guitars that are obvious
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:33.040]  even trigger Willie Nelson won't go out of the country would trigger even though
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:38.040]  it's 60 years old because they'll take his wooden guitar when he leaves the
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:46.040]  country yeah yep it's a the travesty well in closing sir specifically with
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:49.040]  the Lacey act because they wouldn't tell you at first what was about they're
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:53.040]  now saying look we're not denying you have certified wood that isn't endangered
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:57.040]  from a group that's certified under law we're saying you work the wood and
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:08.040]  that's illegal right and that that that is just so ironic it's not what this
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:13.040]  country is about well specifically you've got a press release out on it but
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:17.040]  what are they how are they saying it's illegal to buy wood from overseas and
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:22.040]  then and then lay a hand to it well basically what they're trying to do is
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:30.040]  force the law of of a different country in this case India and India has a
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:38.040]  particular law where if if raw wood is not completed completely worked on in
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:43.040]  India it can't be exported in other words India saying don't take our raw materials
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:49.040]  we have to do the work on the raw materials in this particular case and
[02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:56.040]  so if we bought the exact same wood and Indian laborers completed it then we
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:04:04.040]  would be able to do what we do but if American laborers complete it then it's
[02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:09.040]  illegal unbelievable this is the deindustrialization and India's part of
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:13.040]  these free trade deals and we just take their products India's taken most of
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:18.040]  our jobs on record and this is the thanks we get this is a sir are you aware of
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:23.040]  agenda 21 and and how the Lacey acts part of this world government system no
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:27.040]  I'm not but you're under world government now aren't you you've got India dictating
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:32.040]  to you well you know that the Indian government hasn't even made an issue of
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:38.040]  this it's our own US government that's making the issue you know we we have
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:43.040]  lots of paperwork from the Indian government that said that the export was
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:50.040]  legal from their point of view so it's all our government well that's the CEO
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:55.040]  Henry Jeskowitz of Gibson Gibson dot com sir we'll talk to you again tomorrow

[02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:48.040]  documents that over ninety five percent of all the small business government
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:53.040]  contracts go to offshore mega corporations that's illegal and then
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:57.040]  it came out of the mainstream news three months ago that there's a secret
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:03.040]  blacklisting program for small businesses by the White House where the
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:08.040]  contracts are only given to mega businesses of course that's business
[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:14.040]  corrupt mafia business this is the new system here in America where though
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:18.040]  they pass the law saying if there's government contracts it's got to go to
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:24.040]  Americans and JP Morgan who runs most of the welfare phone call systems and
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:28.040]  and food stamp systems their operators are in India nothing against people in
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:33.040]  India folks but you know I guarantee you India is doing their own phone calls for
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:38.040]  their welfare system if they had one and it's the same thing you know that's a
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:43.040]  government contract but it's going overseas they they have tilted the deck
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:48.040]  it's not free market and they've set it up where hundreds of billions a year in
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:53.040]  government contracts ninety five plus percent does not go to small businesses
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:59.040]  even though the law says local small businesses are supposed to get the
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:07.040]  contract but you don't get the contract it's all fraud they're going to have a
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:11.040]  big government you better have it dumping the jobs out on the people but
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:16.040]  it's never like that it's not like that in Soviet Russia or Hugo Chavez is
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:23.040]  Venezuela one of my great crew members smart charming guy really good computer
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:29.040]  programmer self-taught is from Venezuela and he was just down there visiting
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:34.040]  family because his dad died and he said he hadn't been down there in a while and
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:38.040]  he said just in six months or so the place is falling apart they're seizing
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:43.040]  almost all the private businesses private schools private companies there's
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.040]  total inflation everything's falling apart and Chavez has these militias that
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:51.040]  are government like brown shirts running around beating people up doing whenever
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:59.040]  they want and again he wants it turns out I've seen the numbers on it Chavez
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:03.040]  could give everybody the power he wants but if it's not in the neighborhood of
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:07.040]  the towns he likes he just turns the power off most of the time and then he gets
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:13.040]  on TV and giggles and laughs and says I've taken 1200 businesses he's on every
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:17.040]  Sunday this week I've taken thousands of businesses and he'll name some he'll go

[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:44.040]  into houses in the area and after he robbed your house when you were out of
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:49.040]  town he would urinate all over the place and defecate in the house because he
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:54.040]  liked it it was a little not only am I gonna rob you there was a full grown adult
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:12:02.040]  but he's going to go to the bathroom on your couch that's who we're dealing with

[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:19.040]  that they don't like prosperity you know how powerful the engine of liberty is
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:23.040]  and free market everything the Federal Reserve does is quote to stop the
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:27.040]  country from quote overeating remember you always hear that oh we have a 3%
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:31.040]  growth rate we don't want to overheat they didn't want you getting out of debt
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:36.040]  they wanted to get you into debt 3% growth rate with the debt system they created
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:40.040]  you need a 10% at that time in the mid and late 90s to get out of the debt
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.040]  they were getting you set up

[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:03.040]  and they're saying it's precedent setting the feds are say that golden silver
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:11.040]  coins issued by a private mint are counterfeit
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:17.040]  and they say you are terrorist attempting to undermine the government I read

[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:29.040]  these terrorist organizations would seek to challenge the legitimacy of our
[02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:34.040]  democratic form of government this is from the criminal justice department
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:40.040]  caught shipping guns to drug gangs all over this hemisphere including us cities

[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:40.040]  agree with Joel Scalcin his analysis more than half the government has now
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:45.040]  joined dark side and so so you got all these compartmentalized people in the
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:50.040]  FBI in the ATF that's who blew the whistle was good ATF agents they're like
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:54.040]  this is killing a bunch of cops and citizens you're gonna keep now you're
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:59.040]  shipping guns to people in the US this is a drug operation to knock out your
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:02.040]  competition hope that's it we're cutting your pay and promoting the ATF that gave
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:07.040]  the orders but the head guy because he wouldn't take the fall he's been
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:14.040]  forced to stand down today but they actually say here that yes Golden
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:19.040]  Silver coins the way they've written this period our counterfeit not just
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:25.040]  Liberty dollar now Liberty dollar the whole movement in fact we show the
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:30.040]  other side of Liberty dollar is about exposing the private fellow reserve I
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:34.040]  mean competing with the government who's using Golden Silver at stores to buy
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:39.040]  things they were saying we are real US constitutional money we want the
[02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:43.040]  government to move back to silver and gold now seven states have passed laws
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:48.040]  they're beginning to issue silver in several states right now are the feds
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:52.040]  gonna come in and go after them see cuz I just don't know how to explain this
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:58.040]  people it's so simple I'm gonna go to your phone calls I'm gonna read more of
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:02.040]  this coming up and I got a bunch of other news as well but let's go ahead and
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:08.040]  talk to Aaron in South Carolina Aaron what do you think of all this well Alex
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:12.040]  I just want to say you know thank you for the word you spread I'm talking to a
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:16.040]  lot of friends and other people I meet you won't believe how many people listen
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:22.040]  to you down here what you're talking about is really frustrating I'm a I
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:28.040]  myself I'm a paramedic I'm prior military Marine Corps and South Carolina Army
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:33.040]  National Guard as well and people I've talked to it's really surprising even
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:39.040]  active duty law enforcement down here have said they're not willing to violate
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:44.040]  gun seizures on law so you're saying and this is what I'm getting from
[02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.040]  everybody there's a real buzz in government now that do we really want to
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:52.040]  join a Hitler like system and people are having that discussion cuz they should
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:57.040]  be oh absolutely a friend of mine I worked with down here his name is Jean
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:02.040]  we were talking about this and he's a county deputy where I work and also
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:07.040]  part-time basic you see and we were talking about it it was kind of funny
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:12.040]  he said the day they tell me to come and confiscate guns the day I quit because
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:18.040]  it's I love doing day and he said he quit but people are waking up it just I
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:23.040]  think one of the problems is that dichotomy of this Republican Democrat
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:28.040]  my you was a big bush supporter followed lockstep the whole nine yards and
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:33.040]  still I still I woke up and saw that it's the same thing it's Burger King or
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:38.040]  McDonald's which one do you want but they're both bad for you exactly they're
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:43.040]  all either Burger King or McDonald's unless it's Ron Paul he's a statesman
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:47.040]  absolutely on target a true I mean I agree with Lee Rockwell we haven't seen
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:52.040]  something like this since the days of the founders I mean he is educated a
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:57.040]  wise man a true wise man you know here's God providing us this true wise man
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:04.040]  right at the brink and saying will you choose this America and God just gives
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:08.040]  us chance after chance my friend well I've been told people and I pick up
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:13.040]  patients and stuff and we'll start talking and I try to inform them and I
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:17.040]  tell them I said you and I pick up white patients black patients rich boys
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:21.040]  don't matter and I'll tell them I'll say you realize Obama doesn't care about
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.040]  you because you're black Hillary doesn't care for you because you're a woman
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:30.040]  what didn't care about me to the white you not understand that they don't care
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:36.040]  and we've talked to people they kind of sit there and go you're right because I
[02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:40.040]  said I'll tell them one was the last time President Obama had to worry about
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:46.040]  staying in a tower bill and they all look at me kind of like you're right and I
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:50.040]  try every day when I talk to patients patients family is try to wake them up
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:55.040]  well listen it's come out in the news that blacks are totally waking up to Obama
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:59.040]  Democrats are waking up that's in my stack but I want to explain to people a
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:02.040]  lot of conservatives are like who we're exposing him no no no they're exposing
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:06.040]  the the last puppet who's going to get all beat up then they'll bring a new one
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:11.040]  in it's about getting them past that it's fun to hate Obama he's a horrible
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:15.040]  sellout globalist I hate him but at the end of the day he's a low-level
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:20.040]  enemy soldier we're talking about the real controllers they want us to fight him
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:25.040]  instead of going to the top and going after David Rockefeller Queen Beatrix
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:30.040]  the Queen of England the Rothschilds and I risk my life every time I say
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:35.040]  there's the bullseye I don't care let's get that straight I'm committed I'm in God's
[02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:39.040]  hands that's the end of it and we need to have that same attitude God bless you

[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:22.040]  Remember yesterday Mike Adams was in here and he talked about the
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:28.040]  Department of Defense funding the propaganda group that claims that
[02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:32.040]  they're private but with government funding or say they don't get government
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:38.040]  funding but 64% from the military we were just sent a photo by a listener of the
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:42.040]  McDonald's trays that are coming out right now for the start of school the
[02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:46.040]  piece of paper and he's got a shot of the hamburger and the fries and it says
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:50.040]  immunize you know for your health and we're going to show that photo coming
[02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:54.040]  up and guess who gives money to that private consortium that was set up by
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:59.040]  the government who propagandizes and covers up the vaccines killing people
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:06.040]  McDonald's they're on the list I mean this is a sick cult of people you know
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:11.040]  they take any other hamburger brand and put it under glass it rots not McDonald's
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:18.040]  I'm telling you folks these people are pure evil pure evil they know exactly
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:23.040]  what they're doing Chris in Florida you're on the air welcome
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:27.040]  well Alex it's the Fed as you know destroyed the national currency and
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:31.040]  they're the financial terrorists they've destroyed our sense of national unity
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:36.040]  they've forced us to resort to community currencies and time banks and outright
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:40.040]  bartering but about a year ago you may remember I called into your show and had
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:46.040]  the honor to raise a question to fellow freedom champion Bob Chapman that in
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:52.040]  January 2009 the definition of lawful money in federal law at title 12 US
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:58.040]  code section 152 said that so the quote the terms lawful money and lawful money
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:02.040]  of the United States shall be construed to mean gold and silver coin of the
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:06.040]  United States and I brought that up because it seemed like that was being
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:11.040]  turned into the SDR that was my question if anybody had any other research on
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:17.040]  that but it's also interesting that in light of title 12 section 411 to the
[02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:21.040]  Federal Reserve notes quote shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:24.040]  the Treasury Department of the United States in the city of Washington
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:29.040]  District of Columbia or at any federal no I hear you I hear you just
[02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:34.040]  interrupt for a moment well I'll get to it in a minute because I'm sorry they
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:37.040]  just put on screen the photo of the McDonald's hamburgers and get your
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:44.040]  immunization and I bet that's printed on bisphenol a ink which also is toxic
[02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:48.040]  and sterilizes you you just one sure awake you realize they're hitting you
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:57.040]  from every angle pardon me oh they dotted the heart the eye with a heart
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:02.040]  immunized with a heart for healthy lives and it says with school around just
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:07.040]  around the corner be sure and take your shot you got the chemicalized toxic
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:12.040]  food along with the hey get your shots and some corn syrup based ketchup right
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:17.040]  there and most of the printer inks between all a absolutely devastating
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:25.040]  everybody and you got all the McDonald's admittedly fries their their nuggets
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:35.040]  in the chemical precursor of silicone oh my god this total power total evil total
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:40.040]  wickedness look at it a Tarrant County this is up in Dallas immunized kids
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:45.040]  Dallas area partnership Colin County Denton County oh everybody gets your
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:50.040]  shot and all the government seals the same government nationwide that's
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:55.040]  taking babies blood secretly at birth for 39 years the same hardcore evil and
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:59.040]  yes sir it's in the Constitution and it's under federal law they passed
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:04.040]  another law what an 84 saying silver and gold is lawful money and when it's
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:09.040]  issued by the US Mint it has to be taken at face value so this is a $20 piece
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:14.040]  it's worth 20 even it's really worth 1800 and but Liberty dollar came out and
[02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:18.040]  said here's our own silver and gold and there's all these other hundreds and
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:23.040]  hundreds of companies thousands over the years that issue their own silver and
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:29.040]  gold rounds and again even AP back at the time said this is not illegal what
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:33.040]  did this jury do he's got to appeal this well these are kept juries that
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.040]  convict 98% of the time in federal court you really believe 98% of people are
[02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:43.040]  really guilty no and so for 14 years they issue silver and gold coins they
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:47.040]  operate publicly they start becoming popular and they send a criminal group
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:52.040]  of scum to go in who then put out the following statement at the FBI website
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:56.040]  Charlotte division attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:59.040]  country which the federal service done are simply a unique form of domestic

[02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:17.040]  underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president
[02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:22.040]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon
[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:27.040]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies
[02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:32.040]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:36.040]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:40.040]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:44.040]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:50.040]  right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy
[02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:56.040]  of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're watching online right now
[02:32:56.040 --> 02:33:14.040]  and super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:18.040]  okay I got economic news I want to get into and some other stories we haven't even
[02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:24.040]  covered dealing with military movements around the world but it is such a big deal
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:29.040]  I have the feds come out and only say you're a terrorist if you have silver gold
[02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:34.040]  or if you coin your own silver gold which is totally legal and lawful
[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:39.040]  they've got juries that'll send you to jail oh yeah they'll do whatever they're told
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:44.040]  they'll say this is counterfeiting when it's not but now they're saying if you're
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:50.040]  holding it if you're holding Liberty coins it's over and then they can
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:55.040]  obviously the way this is written expand that out into silver and gold we're
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:34:00.040]  gonna be discussing that in a moment but first let's go to Scott in Idaho
[02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:06.040]  Scott thanks for holding oh thank you Alex I think today's theme is concerning
[02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:11.040]  the swarms of officers he sent to harass our people and eat out their substance
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:15.040]  and as most of your listeners are pretty much aware this has been going on for a
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:21.040]  long long time but not everybody's got a name like Gibson or not house and you
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:25.040]  know they make big cases out of there but they're really running wild now
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:29.040]  there are thousands of tickets and arrests now for lemonade I mean they are
[02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:34.040]  actually have an armed police raid people you know five year old six year old
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:39.040]  so eliminate it's they flip out and and you don't want to when a police dog gets
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:44.040]  killed two million dollar ceremony jets helicopters California council person
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:49.040]  gets killed going into a marijuana field flags and half mass but when we die
[02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:54.040]  it's funny it's cute it's all about worshiping them worshiping them sucking
[02:34:54.040 --> 02:35:01.040]  off of us and you and I Alex we both know what this guy this manager owner of
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:06.040]  Gibson guitars is in for you might remember the multi-mineral dollar
[02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:11.040]  mineral water supplement company and the millionaire that owned it a few years
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:16.040]  back he was indicted for paying his employers in gold and silver which is
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:21.040]  lawfully US currency as far as the laws are still concerned but they came after
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:26.040]  him at he had a million dollar lawyer and his million dollar lawyer suggested
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:31.040]  that they they hire also a federal prosecutor who happened to be the
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:35.040]  federal prosecutor on the Timothy McVeigh case so you have these two high
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:39.040]  price lawyers in there he called me he wanted me in on the case because he was
[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:44.040]  a patriot and he was aware of the work that I do I went in there Alex to that
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:48.040]  meeting room and they were all dressed in their nice suits and there was only
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:53.040]  about me and the defendant and his parents and these two lawyers and
[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:57.040]  another person I can't think of and they sat around the table and talked for
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:02.040]  about 45 minutes and finally they turned to me and said you do you have
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:07.040]  anything to say and I said yeah what do you what are you guys going to do that
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:13.040]  98% of the lawyers that come into federal court don't do because that's their
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:18.040]  success ratio when it comes to conviction of United States citizens
[02:36:18.040 --> 02:36:22.040]  we've already got the highest incarceration rate in the world we currently
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:29.040]  every one out of every 137 or less American citizens are in jail in
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:34.040]  prison or on probation or parole the police state is here and for those
[02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:40.040]  who are awake you need to understand and learn what your rights are and if I
[02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:45.040]  could give any better piece of advice to all your listeners Alex I would tell them
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:50.040]  the same thing I tell the people that come to my seminars I give you three
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:55.040]  real quick tips when confronted by law enforcement number one is keep your
[02:36:55.040 --> 02:37:00.040]  mouth shut 98% of all convictions in this country are gotten through admissions
[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:05.040]  and confession so if you don't say anything you're got a better chance of
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:11.040]  not being convicted number two is keep your mouth closed and number three is
[02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:16.040]  shut up and number four is keep your mouth shut and listen here's the deal
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:20.040]  they didn't teach this a hundred years ago but they teach it now they tell
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:26.040]  prosecutors it's your job to convict even if you know they're innocent and
[02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:30.040]  that's why prosecutors come out all the time even when it turns out somebody's
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:36.040]  innocent they will go fight keep them in jail and it just this country has been
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:41.040]  handed completely over to evil I appreciate your call and right now the
[02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:46.040]  cancer is really spreading the founders warned us about it it grew slowly now
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:50.040]  it's all over the body and it's killing the country the country's falling apart
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:54.040]  and the cancer is just dancing going I'm growing I'm growing it doesn't know it's
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:59.040]  destroying its future as well it doesn't care and they've got all these moron
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:04.040]  Barney five types working for him who actually think that everybody's a
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:09.040]  criminal but them know you're the criminal you are a criminal you just
[02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:14.040]  don't know it you are the jack boot but again it's not even the cops I get mad
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:17.040]  at most of them are just like the general public raised on floor I totally
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:21.040]  brain damaged can't tie their shoelaces you know the commander knows how to tie
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:27.040]  their shoelaces all the rest don't it it's not just that it's the master
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:32.040]  controllers of all this and I don't want to just be played off against a bunch
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:35.040]  of idiots I know there are a lot of police and military that aren't stupid
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:39.040]  are waking up and the problem is that the establishment knows how to announce a
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:45.040]  big story have the big narrative it's all about theater that's why they do a
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:49.040]  year-long million-dollar investigation of Amish publicly selling their neighbors
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:55.040]  raw milk cheese which you can buy at any grocery store it's not illegal they've
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:59.040]  got to show that it's not like even these federal juries are evil demons
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:03.040]  they're like weird little spongy creatures that are little pets of the
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:09.040]  system and they love sitting folks to prison and they get off on it so they'll do
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:12.040]  whatever the judge and prosecutor tells them so that they've got to show them
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:16.040]  here we are undercover first buying the cheese one year before and it shows the
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:21.040]  Amish God doo doo doo oh hi good to see you again Wendy oh you'd like some of

[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:56.040]  guilty third send the Amish to jail and then they leave and they go out and have

[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:25.040]  remember that I know I know I'm a conspiracy theorist right sure I am
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:30.040]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up here and then we'll go back to your calls Ted
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:35.040]  what do you make of this your 30 plus years in the gold and silver business
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:40.040]  in fact that's something going on my microphone again
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:44.040]  but Ted are you ruffling your microphone up there no no it's not mine that's
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:47.040]  it's yours so something goes on with this mic now is this one that fell off the
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:53.040]  table a few months ago we gotta check it anyways the point is that
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:58.040]  he's not gonna be known as Ted the terrorist so I bring you 30 years in the
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:02.040]  evil terrorist business the head of Gibson should be known as a
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:08.040]  Jukowits the terrorist I mean anybody who tries to have a job here 14 years
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:16.040]  the Liberty outfit before that he had the royal Hawaiian men and they put out
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:21.040]  little members in the TV ads everywhere so now copper silver gold they also I
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:24.040]  guess have had the plates with presidents on them well I guess those are
[02:42:24.040 --> 02:42:28.040]  illegal too just everything is illegal and of course they said a few months
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:32.040]  ago that it's terrorism and that they would destroy them but now they're
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:36.040]  saying if you have a Liberty dollar that they're gonna SWAT team rage you in
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:41.040]  that it is counterfeit and even for educational or any purposes they are
[02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:48.040]  illegal so this looks like a very dangerous precedent with the secret
[02:42:48.040 --> 02:42:53.040]  service and the fed saying that these silver and gold coins are counterfeit
[02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:56.040]  and it looks like they're gonna try to expand that out Ted I mean this is a
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:01.040]  group of scallywags yeah yeah I would say so when I seen that convention come
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:05.040]  through for Bernardo Vanados I thought man I they should be convicting the
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:10.040]  Federal Reserve Bank not this guy honestly I mean I'm looking at your
[02:43:10.040 --> 02:43:16.040]  article on the prisonplanet.com and Kurt Nemo just knocked one out of the
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:19.040]  park with this one I hope everybody gets over there reads it and spreads the
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:24.040]  word get it to their friends you got to remember back in 1933 when the Federal
[02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:28.040]  Reserve System was in trouble then and their bank branches didn't have enough
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:32.040]  gold to pay their depositors and that people standing in line FDR closed the
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:37.040]  banks on Friday he confiscated gold on Monday now if you don't think that
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:41.040]  they're they have the capacity of doing it again think again this was a
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:46.040]  confiscation of silver I mean here's the crazy thing here's the key point I want
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:50.040]  to make your take on if you go to the FBI's website and read the Justice
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:54.040]  Department ruling and we have the link to it but then the latest statements by
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:57.040]  the Secret Service saying it's not just them if you've got these coins we're
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:02.040]  gonna come for you it's that they say he's convicted of counterfeiting and
[02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:07.040]  had the kept jury of low-grade morons convicting and even again AP even said
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:12.040]  he didn't violate the statute this is bizarre this is dangerous you know it's
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:18.040]  not just that they expand here and later in her ruling they say he sought to
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:23.040]  challenge with a new currency and undermine the currency of the US but
[02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:27.040]  it's not currency of the US it's the Federal Reserve note they just look
[02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:32.040]  like dollars it's like saying something's a Ford or a Chevy but really
[02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:37.040]  it's a you go that's what they've done here it says Federal Reserve note as
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:42.040]  you know since the 1920s or so President Kennedy tried to bring it back and got
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:46.040]  a bullet in his head he did issue five billion of the Lincoln Greenback
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:50.040]  before they killed him that does say United States know not Federal Reserve
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:54.040]  notes but the thing is they say oh we convicted him of counterfeiting even
[02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:58.040]  though he never said this is US I mean Federal Reserve money or competed with
[02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:02.040]  the you know with the official money system he said you better get silver and
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.040]  gold the states need to adopt this he was a real money advocate like Ron Paul
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:11.040]  so but then they admit in their own statement by the US Attorney and the
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:16.040]  prosecutors that we went after him because he was challenging the system so
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:21.040]  they admit they framed him and had a wicked jury or they may just be mentally
[02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:26.040]  retarded convict him yeah yeah that's right they convicted him because he went
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:30.040]  against the Federal Reserve system no doubt about it they were he was going
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:35.040]  against the currency political prisoner and they admit it was political in
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:41.040]  their own statement that's right and you know it as crazy as that sounds it's
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:46.040]  obviously the color of law it's not the law itself that he's convicted by and
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:50.040]  it's just you know that it's not to think that this kind of thing can happen
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:54.040]  here in the United States and they're sending homage to jail that sell their
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:58.040]  cheese that sold and hold foods and legal but they show the jury the raid I
[02:45:58.040 --> 02:46:03.040]  mean you could raid Jesus Christ 2000 years ago and federal juries would
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:07.040]  send him to a gas chamber I mean I mean they could raid George Washington and
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:12.040]  and the jury would say killing I mean you could raid you could raid Mother
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:16.040]  Teresa and have guns out a jury would say well the cops aim guns at you go to
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:20.040]  prison I mean you understand that it's all part of theater Ted yeah I sure do
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:25.040]  and it's it's it's amazing to watch I mean I honestly I don't know where this
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:29.040]  country is gonna end up because we certainly don't have literally here
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:33.040]  they went after Gibson under an agenda 21 UN regulation saying you can't work
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:37.040]  wood inside the US if it's far and produced I know I know I saw that and
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:41.040]  that's just an it's by the way during the breaks that guy was almost crying
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:44.040]  totally freaked out because they're telling him he's going to prison I mean
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:48.040]  he just totally freaked out legally bought it and there's goons reportedly
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:52.040]  that was in the other reports giggling and laughing and smirking and threatening
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:56.040]  his employees to lie about him or they'll go to prison I mean these are scum
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:47:02.040]  of earth mafia filth Nazi trash evil yeah yep you're right when is somebody
[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:08.040]  gonna call a spade a spade Ted you know it's I don't know I there is
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:13.040]  definitely a huge opposition against this thing going on and it's getting
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:16.040]  bigger and a lot of the reason why that's happening is because we have people
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:21.040]  like you I mean that's why I'm I'm pushing so hard with for this video the
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:25.040]  American dream can we get that out so people can actually by the way it's

[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:08.040]  sitting in prison because he's trying to offer constitutional money something

[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:17.040]  this fiat thing is absolutely stuff that's being just printed from nothing
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:22.040]  from thin air and putting us into debt at the process and we end up owing these
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:27.040]  banksters you know and the whole thing is so crazy upside down and that's why

[02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:34.040]  well here's the other I agree to there's other good news those seven states have
[02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:39.040]  now passed laws to issue their own silver and gold currency mainly silver

[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:47.040]  confirmed I've got all that news I'm just I'm gonna be on TV tonight another
[02:54:47.040 --> 02:54:53.040]  special report seven o'clock on a host of issues this is not the nightly news
[02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:57.040]  nightly news is every night seven o'clock and then at least once a week we're
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:04.020]  usual reports documentary films that are going to debut sometimes i'll do
[02:55:04.020 --> 02:55:08.040]  emergency call in shows with guest when things are breaking all at prison
[02:55:08.040 --> 02:55:12.040]  planet dot TV and it works out down the road will turn it into a little
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:15.040]  network Ok. Let's go to Scott Washington.
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:17.040]  Scott, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:23.040]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment about the Libyan situation and you
[02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:30.640]  how the fake left-right media is portraying it. And notice I was watching this clip of
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:37.920]  Tom Hartman sitting around here talking about the fact that this whole thing and the Libyan
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:43.360]  situation, the way that Obama went in there and did this was the success and that the Republicans
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:48.000]  were mad and they didn't want to give him any credit for doing all of this kind of stuff.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:54.240]  Now, nevertheless, the fact that you got that makes the left then think, oh, Republicans don't
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:59.040]  like it. I'm for it. Just like when they have Democrats attack Republicans, Republicans then
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:03.680]  go support the Republicans, even though it's globalist policy. And Republicans attack Democrats
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:09.360]  that that makes everybody then go support the Democrats. It's total elementary level moron
[02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:15.120]  mind game. And this is why I don't like Tom Hartman. Years ago, I'd go on his show on radio,
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:20.320]  smart, reasonable, didn't agree with everything, but he knew what he was talking about.
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:23.680]  Now I've gone on his TV show and he's like, extreme right-winger, Alex Jones,
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:29.280]  Joneses, even though he knows I'm not about that whole paradigm, playing the labels. So he's just
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:35.680]  an operative up there punching buttons. Yeah, exactly. And then you got people like
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:42.160]  Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly now trying to attack Cynthia McKinney because
[02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:46.880]  she's gone over there and reported about what's going on over there, you know, trying to put this
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:50.080]  narrative out there. Yeah, she's been proven right. She said three months ago, and she was
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:54.720]  over there. They were systematically killing black people that were on the government side.
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:57.920]  And now it's confirmed. There's just piles of dead black people everywhere. They're just killing
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:02.960]  them. They pull them out of houses and kill them. And then trying to like, well, where is she getting
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:08.560]  the money to go over there trying to, you know, put this narrative out that she's being paid off
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:13.920]  and stuff. So, you know, you could say what you want about Cynthia McKinney. She's got 10 times
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:18.800]  the courage of most men and she went over there to report on what's going on. Nobody's seeing
[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:23.840]  Gaddafi was a great guy. The point is they're putting people even worse in there. Now it's a
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:28.720]  total humanitarian disaster when they claim they lied and said it wasn't a war from the beginning.
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:34.080]  Remember? Oh, yeah. Well, that was just like the last time when I called into your show and that
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:39.680]  silly House Parks was on there and I challenged him about, well, why aren't you guys complaining now
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:44.640]  about the stuff Obama's doing, which is the same thing that Bush was doing and even more. And,
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:50.400]  you know, remember the narrative that he put out there about, well, you know, a UN resolution is
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:56.960]  different from just going in and invading a country. And now it turns out there were UN, US,
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:01.760]  NATO trips there the whole time. The uprising was started. It was all fake and they lied to us as
[02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:06.960]  usual. We have a completely criminal government. I mean, it's just filled with abject criminals at
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:12.800]  the top with a bunch of yes men and women under them. Here's a new report. Report on man who faces
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:19.280]  life sentence for recording cops. And all over the country, they say you take cops in public,
[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:24.560]  life in prison. It's actually in mainline news and he'll go to prison. It's how America works now.
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:30.320]  I mean, it's just absolutely criminal. We are in so much trouble. They hire all these
[02:58:30.320 --> 02:58:36.400]  nothings, all these nothings, give them guns, power, and just say go destroy America. And they
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:59:01.680]  say dig high and go running off crazy into the mountains.
