[00:00.000 --> 00:29.960]  Now to growing concerns about the deadly coronavirus officially hitting the U.S.
[00:29.960 --> 00:33.440]  here's what we know Chinese authorities are effectively putting a
[00:33.440 --> 00:37.960]  quarantine on an entire city there is heightened concern all across the world
[00:37.960 --> 00:41.920]  including here at the U.S. officials here in Wuhan have designated nine
[00:41.920 --> 00:45.640]  hospitals as treatment centers including this one right behind me there
[00:45.640 --> 00:51.920]  is no vaccine the virus is new so no one knows exactly what it can do and
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.720]  there's always potential for it to mutate they are putting Wuhan the city
[00:56.720 --> 01:01.840]  limits under a lockdown Wuhan in China now on lockdown as the country struggles
[01:01.840 --> 01:05.360]  with fear of a pandemic desperate measures to try and contain the deadly
[01:05.360 --> 01:09.680]  coronavirus more than 11 million people who live in that city now kept from
[01:09.680 --> 01:14.000]  leaving further cases have also been confirmed in Thailand Japan and South
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.320]  Korea outside of Asia the virus has now reached the U.S. to screenings are
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.880]  already happening at airports around the world heat sensors checking for a
[01:23.880 --> 01:28.600]  fever and medical workers on standby when you arrive from the epicenter of the
[01:28.600 --> 01:34.560]  coronavirus outbreak this is what awaits you city is now controlling people
[01:34.560 --> 01:39.280]  going in and out of the city then also local tourist groups are being banned
[01:39.280 --> 01:43.800]  from leaving the government does not want this infection to leave officials
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.880]  in California Tennessee and Texas now testing patients for possible infection
[01:48.880 --> 01:53.360]  checkpoints are everywhere measuring the temperature of the few drivers still
[01:53.360 --> 01:58.800]  on the streets this is a city the grip of a deadly disease the city of 11
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.520]  million people with almost no one on the streets hospitals in the epicenter of
[02:03.520 --> 02:07.640]  the outbreak are overwhelmed with patients but intervention from the top
[02:07.640 --> 02:29.120]  is likely not enough to stem the spread of the coronavirus they've got giant
[02:29.120 --> 02:33.640]  chemical fumigators driving around pumping massive amounts of chemicals
[02:33.640 --> 02:38.280]  I believe antiviral pesticides what they are into the air to try to kill the
[02:38.280 --> 02:50.840]  virus they believe is airborne brought to you by the Bill and Melinda Gates
[02:50.840 --> 03:06.320]  Foundation reminding you and your family to take all of your vaccines ladies and
[03:06.320 --> 03:15.560]  gentlemen it is Tuesday January 28th 2020 I'm your host Alex Jones the
[03:15.560 --> 03:20.440]  coronavirus is now a global pandemic by the UN World Health Organization's own
[03:20.440 --> 03:25.360]  metric they've not announced that yet but it is spreading across the world and
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.080]  we've confirmed Bill and Melinda Gates and their sub foundations do have a
[03:30.080 --> 03:38.160]  vaccine ready and are set to be global superstars that save us from this
[03:38.160 --> 03:47.080]  synthetic crisis the whole thing has been pre-programmed and prepared they are
[03:47.080 --> 03:50.720]  rolling out their operation now just a few days ago they said it was a
[03:50.720 --> 03:54.720]  conspiracy theory that the patented virus they have is a vaccine now they're
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.520]  saying oh no they can roll it right into vaccine production next week
[04:00.520 --> 04:05.560]  scientists around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against the disease
[04:05.560 --> 04:10.680]  Chinese researchers were able to quickly identify and share the genetic
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.280]  sequence of the new coronavirus allowing scientific research teams to get
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.760]  to work right away they hope to build on the data and research gathered during
[04:20.760 --> 04:26.760]  the 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS the disease
[04:26.760 --> 04:31.800]  is also caused by a form of the coronavirus the research teams are
[04:31.800 --> 04:36.160]  pursuing several different approaches with global health agencies hoping at
[04:36.160 --> 04:41.480]  least one treatment will be ready for human trials within a few months the
[04:41.480 --> 04:47.080]  new virus is not as deadly as Merce or SARS but scientists fear it could mutate
[04:47.080 --> 04:54.920]  into an even deadlier and more contagious variant evidence melts that the
[04:54.920 --> 05:02.880]  coronavirus is a synthetic pathogen it is the leader of Cobra here for a
[05:02.880 --> 05:09.880]  message to President Trump the American people and Alex Jones of info wars our
[05:09.880 --> 05:15.000]  operation to our partners the communist Chinese have bought control of your
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.360]  media but it's true your people are beginning to awaken that's why
[05:21.360 --> 05:28.160]  Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war mashings and bombings which
[05:28.160 --> 05:34.360]  will be blamed on those loyal to America anyone wants me stage these attacks
[05:34.360 --> 05:42.720]  that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future you
[05:42.720 --> 05:49.360]  see when you expose our false flags and fake media I will carry out attacks and
[05:49.360 --> 05:54.760]  then playing you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass
[05:54.760 --> 06:12.080]  shootings we committed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[06:12.080 --> 06:32.000]  world order it's Alex Jones
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.040]  well the coronavirus is now a global pandemic we have high-level sources
[06:38.040 --> 06:44.400]  inside the government and in industry that have told us we're working on
[06:44.400 --> 06:48.040]  publishing a story working with Mike Adams and others right now triple
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.320]  confirming that they believe it's broken containment on the West Coast already
[06:53.320 --> 06:58.400]  and are preparing to try to somehow roll that news out slowly so it doesn't
[06:58.400 --> 07:06.560]  create larger panic Chinese students coming back after the new year into
[07:06.560 --> 07:12.080]  major West Coast cities were not identified that they had it before they
[07:12.080 --> 07:15.640]  were able to spread it to unknown numbers and to believe that you're now
[07:15.640 --> 07:20.840]  going to see an exponential growth rate of the virus but don't worry that you've
[07:20.840 --> 07:24.640]  got your first cases in places like Germany and Europe and that now the
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.520]  Chinese government is saying they believe there's 300,000 cases oh we were
[07:29.520 --> 07:34.520]  fake news a few days ago saying 45,000 cases when the Hong Kong Scientific
[07:34.520 --> 07:38.040]  Institute at their major University said that in the models they have with
[07:38.040 --> 07:42.920]  computers that was conservative now we have articles up on info wars calm that
[07:42.920 --> 07:46.760]  linked directly to the Chinese government announcements saying oh now
[07:46.760 --> 07:53.640]  it's 300,000 they think with Xi Jinping calling the virus a demon isn't it
[07:53.640 --> 07:56.520]  interesting that the coronavirus has been heavily studied by the Chinese
[07:56.520 --> 08:00.200]  Communist government by the Bill and the Gates Foundation and through a sub
[08:00.200 --> 08:06.120]  foundation that Bill and his father fund two years ago they patented the
[08:06.120 --> 08:11.960]  coronavirus for use in a vaccine and now they may be able to rush it in to
[08:11.960 --> 08:17.600]  production to protect you and your family aren't we just blessed and lucky
[08:17.600 --> 08:21.720]  just last week the media said there is no one working on a vaccine it's a
[08:21.720 --> 08:25.560]  conspiracy theory there's sites out there saying that there's government
[08:25.560 --> 08:28.920]  groups and others that have vaccines secretly developed that this has been
[08:28.920 --> 08:36.960]  staged to push vaccines on the public but now NBC News J&J scientific officer
[08:36.960 --> 08:42.000]  pretty confident they can create coronavirus vaccine as outbreak widens
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.920]  because they've got a bunch of patented viruses of it that have been patented
[08:46.920 --> 08:52.640]  for use in a vaccine so you just mix it all up and there it all is China curbs
[08:52.640 --> 08:58.880]  travel to Hong Kong as projections show 300,000 might already be infected the
[08:58.880 --> 09:02.480]  morning China's top health officials shared some grim statistics and says
[09:02.480 --> 09:05.400]  they believe it could be as high as 300,000 right now so they're starting to
[09:05.400 --> 09:10.240]  be a little bit more honest because the word is it could be millions if you look
[09:10.240 --> 09:14.320]  at Hoonan a city of 11 million people there's a lot of ghostly footage out
[09:14.320 --> 09:21.280]  there where it is a empty barren space like something out of I am legend or
[09:21.280 --> 09:27.560]  Omega man or Vincent Price the last man on earth but again I don't believe this
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.360]  is the big one they need to have a virus that's deadly but not ultra deadly
[09:32.360 --> 09:35.240]  because everybody under world government everybody used to being
[09:35.240 --> 09:41.200]  forcibly inoculated in quarantines and shutdowns and these systems of total
[09:41.200 --> 09:47.160]  control just footage from three or four days ago shows people all over Hoonan
[09:47.160 --> 09:52.320]  now I sit footage the crew this morning will play next segment for you and it
[09:52.320 --> 09:57.200]  just shows incredible ghost towns and US and British citizens have gone out and
[09:57.200 --> 10:01.800]  shot footage as well and it's just empty yeah there's some of the footage and
[10:01.800 --> 10:05.160]  they go to the markets that are normally cramble of people you might see five
[10:05.160 --> 10:10.120]  people that's what's shifted from just a few days ago a city of 11 million
[10:10.120 --> 10:15.040]  people to now it's a ghost town with the food running out but let me just do
[10:15.040 --> 10:20.440]  this right now let's just pull back from this
[10:20.440 --> 10:29.120]  Billa Melinda Gates had a giant drill of 65 million people dying from a virus
[10:29.120 --> 10:37.040]  escaping in China three months ago then they fund and help develop a TV show for
[10:37.040 --> 10:44.440]  Netflix a docu-series but I'm gonna be breaking down coming up in the third
[10:44.440 --> 10:51.960]  segment that cash Billa Melinda Gates is the saviors of the earth financing
[10:51.960 --> 10:57.800]  vaccines for a worldwide pandemic of flu they predict with it will kill
[10:57.800 --> 11:03.400]  hundreds of millions and of course other vaccines like coronavirus so they even
[11:03.400 --> 11:09.640]  have TV shows on Netflix coinciding with all of this unfolding and they have the
[11:09.640 --> 11:15.360]  vaccine ingredients and the pathogen the genetically engineered virus already
[11:15.360 --> 11:20.440]  waiting in the wings it's simply incredible and they try to hide the fact
[11:20.440 --> 11:25.160]  that they're deeply involved the production of the show but at the end of
[11:25.160 --> 11:31.120]  the show you learn that they've been there all along and it shows into pick
[11:31.120 --> 11:36.360]  this Maverick scientists to develop this wondrous one-size-fits-all flu
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.500]  vaccine that everyone needs to take and that bad people that won't take the
[11:40.500 --> 11:45.720]  vaccines they're the problems so we're all gonna be taught the incredible fear
[11:45.720 --> 11:51.200]  of the coronavirus and cities lockdown and checkpoints and all of this
[11:51.200 --> 12:02.560]  incredible information and then we're taught that the saviors are the United
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.520]  Nations and Billa Melinda Gates and there's massive internet crackdowns by
[12:06.520 --> 12:09.960]  Google Facebook all of them ahead of this the last few months banning
[12:09.960 --> 12:14.600]  everyone that criticizes vaccines major consumer groups major medical groups
[12:14.600 --> 12:19.920]  major studies are being blocked ahead of all this they've been silencing descent
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.400]  and blocking the videos of the UN head scientist saying there's a cover-up of
[12:24.400 --> 12:29.880]  vaccine safety and the mainline doctors are becoming wobbly and don't believe
[12:29.880 --> 12:33.000]  the vaccines are helping people they believe they're hurting people and then
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.760]  that you would admits and we're not testing it we're just given this by
[12:35.760 --> 12:41.720]  big pharma that these vaccines are not even tested oh but believe me they've
[12:41.720 --> 12:46.280]  been tested alright it's all coming up there's a whole separate area to this I
[12:46.280 --> 12:53.760]  told you yesterday that we have had sources through the big food industry and
[12:53.760 --> 12:58.640]  and through you know several major food suppliers that institutional groups
[12:58.640 --> 13:02.480]  governmental groups corporate groups are buying up all the food and that the
[13:02.480 --> 13:09.320]  food prices raw food prices are our skyrocketing well that indeed is now
[13:09.320 --> 13:13.440]  happening and you're now seeing that in the news today and storeable food is
[13:13.440 --> 13:16.640]  selling out everywhere most of the big storeable food suppliers are already
[13:16.640 --> 13:20.960]  sold out because they sold out to big institutional groups my patriot that
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.960]  puts out info or select that's their entire line of food just info or sticker
[13:24.960 --> 13:30.080]  on it still has food they're still able to guarantee delivery within seven to
[13:30.080 --> 13:33.880]  nine days other people will tell you they can do that I can tell you most of
[13:33.880 --> 13:38.480]  them won't but that could change at any time that means if you get your order in
[13:38.480 --> 13:45.120]  now you will get it within seven to nine days and they've got it fresh they're
[13:45.120 --> 13:51.440]  packaging it right now as fast as it can go off the line but if you wait then it
[13:51.440 --> 13:56.080]  might be 10 15 20 days we don't know because already a lot of storeable
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.080]  foods are being bought off the shelves here the gas master and the antiviral
[14:00.080 --> 14:04.600]  master selling out and people are preparing people are concerned people
[14:04.600 --> 14:10.440]  know what's going on also I personally have been taking vitamin D3 with vitamin
[14:10.440 --> 14:15.080]  K or winter Sun because that's the main reason the body breaks down the viruses
[14:15.080 --> 14:20.720]  is a deficiency in vitamin D3 or vitamin K and yes I was already promoting this
[14:20.720 --> 14:25.160]  a month ago because it's the winter time before this even happened we are selling
[14:25.160 --> 14:30.120]  out of our vitamin D3 that's organic and high-quality winter Sun I'm going to
[14:30.120 --> 14:35.280]  keep it at the discounted price I guess until it sells out because that's the
[14:35.280 --> 14:39.760]  right thing to do but it's pretty scary that that's happening and again you go
[14:39.760 --> 14:44.440]  to m4store.com get the highest quality storeable food fresh last 25 years in
[14:44.440 --> 14:48.760]  good high-quality plastic sealed containers with the then containers
[14:48.760 --> 14:52.200]  inside of that as well great for transport this is all just a reminder
[14:52.200 --> 14:55.960]  with the economic crises and with the election looming and the global is
[14:55.960 --> 15:01.320]  trying to cause a civil war and race war but now it's more important than ever to
[15:01.320 --> 15:04.920]  have a get-out-of-dodge plan and to have storeable foods and water filtration and
[15:04.920 --> 15:08.160]  info wars has been right on the front lines of getting people prepared so
[15:08.160 --> 15:11.480]  whether it's the Alexa pure water filtration system that still discounted
[15:11.480 --> 15:14.480]  despite the fact they're selling very fast those are probably gonna sell out
[15:14.480 --> 15:20.400]  in a few weeks at projections the food again at my patriot that private labels
[15:20.400 --> 15:24.000]  ours they're selling out very very quickly we have the lowest prices you're
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.400]  gonna find from my patriot or any other distributors at info or store.com in
[15:28.400 --> 15:31.320]  fact we were way lower than all of them but they called your stance and said look
[15:31.320 --> 15:34.080]  our prices have gone way up you're gonna have to raise it up to at least this
[15:34.080 --> 15:38.000]  point but info or store.com has the lowest price you're gonna find on the
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.240]  high-quality food from my patriot supply.com and the order just goes to
[15:41.240 --> 15:45.760]  them every hour and then they ship it out right there and then that also funds
[15:45.760 --> 15:52.240]  the info war which is a 360 win but the big deal is that according to the UN
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.160]  zone definition the coronavirus is now a global pandemic and obviously it's
[15:57.160 --> 16:02.440]  synthetic. Attention GCN self-reliance listeners if you've ever wanted an

[16:31.280 --> 16:35.280]  offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the

[20:27.560 --> 20:28.560]  The grid.
[20:30.320 --> 20:31.320]  A digital frontier.
[20:33.800 --> 20:37.320]  I tried to think your clusters of information as they move through the computer.
[20:38.920 --> 20:39.920]  What did they look like?
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  Chips. Motorcycles.
[20:43.840 --> 20:45.320]  With a circuit slot free by hand.
[20:46.400 --> 20:47.920]  I kept dreaming of the world.
[20:48.120 --> 20:49.120]  I thought I'd never see it.
[20:50.600 --> 20:53.120]  And then one day
[20:53.120 --> 21:12.120]  I cracked the code and got into the matrix 25 years ago the enemy's plan was
[21:12.120 --> 21:16.720]  actually public to establish a world government and then use incremental
[21:16.720 --> 21:23.760]  bio weapon releases that the planetary state will claim are naturally
[21:23.760 --> 21:29.560]  occurring to corral and control the public and then finally launch the
[21:29.560 --> 21:34.640]  depopulation while themselves posing as the saviors trying to defend humanity.
[21:35.640 --> 21:39.400]  But out of the other side of their mouth, Bill Gates and the globalists admit
[21:39.840 --> 21:41.560]  they want to euthanize the old people.
[21:42.400 --> 21:45.720]  They put up equations talking about bringing the human population down to zero
[21:45.720 --> 21:51.360]  to save the earth that Ted talks and the crowds cheer when other top scientists
[21:51.360 --> 21:54.880]  talk about airborne Ebola coming to cleanse us of the earth like the
[21:54.880 --> 21:56.440]  villain out of 12 monkeys.
[21:56.680 --> 22:00.600]  They're giving standing ovations.
[22:01.280 --> 22:04.680]  But then they say, don't question their vaccines.
[22:04.960 --> 22:08.520]  Don't question what they want to put in our body despite the insert saying they
[22:08.520 --> 22:12.400]  can kill us and all the adverse reactions in the skyrocketing autism and
[22:12.400 --> 22:16.120]  cancer and the UN's own head scientist saying there's a cover up.
[22:16.440 --> 22:17.200]  No.
[22:18.280 --> 22:21.520]  When people like Bill Gates tell you my dad ran Planned Parenthood and I
[22:21.520 --> 22:25.560]  want to exterminate people and there's too many people, we should roll up our
[22:25.560 --> 22:28.400]  sleeves and take whatever he wants to put in our bodies.
[22:29.920 --> 22:36.360]  So the definition of a pandemic from Merriam Webster dictionary can also go
[22:36.360 --> 22:43.880]  to the major medical sites occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting
[22:43.880 --> 22:47.600]  an exponentially high proportion of the population.
[22:47.600 --> 22:49.080]  What's exponential mean?
[22:50.680 --> 23:00.120]  Well, it means that the pathogen is exponentially logarithmically doubling
[23:00.120 --> 23:05.560]  every time it's able to replicate and spread.
[23:07.560 --> 23:09.320]  So are you prepared for the global pandemic?
[23:09.320 --> 23:14.480]  Because it's here and it's already the Chinese government reporting
[23:14.480 --> 23:18.800]  infecting as many as 30,000 people a few days ago.
[23:18.800 --> 23:22.400]  Now they're saying 300 plus thousand now.
[23:24.720 --> 23:29.160]  And you've got major universities in Hong Kong saying that there's a cover
[23:29.160 --> 23:30.720]  up on just how bad it is.
[23:30.720 --> 23:33.760]  And now you've got Xi Jinping saying it's a demon out of control.
[23:33.760 --> 23:41.800]  But here's a world map that's up to yesterday on what's happening.
[23:41.800 --> 23:46.040]  There's not new information loaded in until the UN decides to put it out there.
[23:46.040 --> 23:48.080]  So remember, these numbers are way lower than they are.
[23:48.400 --> 23:51.400]  And as you see, that is a map through a TV viewer of the planet.
[23:53.160 --> 23:56.840]  That is a map of Russia and Asia.
[23:56.840 --> 24:00.840]  But China, right there in the middle in there, you see the United States.
[24:00.840 --> 24:02.840]  And you see Canada.
[24:02.840 --> 24:05.840]  And then of course, you go over, you see Germany.
[24:05.840 --> 24:07.840]  Let's see if they've updated it.
[24:07.840 --> 24:09.840]  Let's go to Western Europe.
[24:09.840 --> 24:11.840]  And they've updated it.
[24:11.840 --> 24:13.840]  We've got France.
[24:13.840 --> 24:15.840]  We've got Germany.
[24:15.840 --> 24:18.840]  We've got other areas when you pull back.
[24:18.840 --> 24:24.840]  Now remember, this is all with 8 to 10 day incubation period.
[24:24.840 --> 24:27.840]  Many of the people that have it don't even have a temperature.
[24:27.840 --> 24:36.840]  So you don't know perfect carriers with a according to Landsat's own study,
[24:36.840 --> 24:40.840]  which think God used a very small at 44 people.
[24:40.840 --> 24:42.840]  They said they needed 60 something.
[24:42.840 --> 24:49.840]  They said it's not complete, but it found a massive infection rate and above a 15% death rate.
[24:49.840 --> 24:54.840]  So remember, we reported, Mike Adams reported 44,000 now infected,
[24:54.840 --> 24:59.840]  born University of Hong Kong researchers in the South Hong Kong post.
[24:59.840 --> 25:02.840]  But now, oh, the media said that's this info.
[25:02.840 --> 25:04.840]  We've got a blacklist, natural news.
[25:04.840 --> 25:06.840]  We've got a blacklist info wars.
[25:06.840 --> 25:07.840]  Got to block our site.
[25:07.840 --> 25:08.840]  That's in the news.
[25:08.840 --> 25:12.840]  We're putting out this info when we link and have a Chinese translation.
[25:12.840 --> 25:16.840]  He speaks Chinese, has businesses in China, his wife's Taiwanese.
[25:16.840 --> 25:21.840]  When he just translates and links to the major newspaper, he's bad.
[25:21.840 --> 25:31.840]  But today, the communist Chinese government came out and said the projections are as high as 300,000 right now.
[25:31.840 --> 25:36.840]  That report up on info wars.com.
[25:36.840 --> 25:41.840]  But the head health official in China came out and said that here we are yesterday.
[25:41.840 --> 25:46.840]  Analyst says cases of coronavirus, possibly 10 times higher than official number.
[25:46.840 --> 25:51.840]  And now we learn it's way above 10 times higher that info wars wasn't fear mongering.
[25:51.840 --> 25:54.840]  Info wars was actually conservative.
[25:54.840 --> 25:58.840]  That said, there are seven and a half billion people on this planet.
[25:58.840 --> 26:03.840]  And in China, you've got a lot of rundown people and a lot of pollution.
[26:03.840 --> 26:08.840]  And whenever these viruses break out there, they have a higher kill rate in China than they do in other parts of the world.
[26:08.840 --> 26:10.840]  Still, it's a terrible thing.
[26:10.840 --> 26:15.840]  But it's the response to it and the vaccine they've gotten the wings.
[26:15.840 --> 26:23.840]  I've got articles here where they're saying, oh, Google and Facebook are blocking liars claiming that this was made in a lab and that they've got a vaccine for it.
[26:23.840 --> 26:24.840]  And it's part of a larger plan.
[26:24.840 --> 26:34.840]  Who wouldn't speculate like that with the long histories of secret testing on the public by this government and others and the tainted vaccines and the things they've been caught adding and.
[26:34.840 --> 26:40.840]  The shock admitting they put cancer viruses in it and said, oh, there's too many people anyways.
[26:40.840 --> 26:46.840]  I can play PBS interviews if you want to see them, you know, film.
[26:46.840 --> 26:48.840]  Of the scientists talking about it.
[26:48.840 --> 26:53.840]  I mean, this is PBS in 1987.
[26:53.840 --> 27:00.840]  This is all public knowledge back when I was a child that was vaccine debates like, well, the swine flu vaccine did kill about 50,000 people.
[27:00.840 --> 27:05.840]  But maybe it was still good because maybe a million would have died from the flu.
[27:05.840 --> 27:07.840]  In the 70s.
[27:07.840 --> 27:10.840]  Back then, it wasn't even debated that vaccines were killing people.
[27:10.840 --> 27:12.840]  They just said, well, it's worth it.
[27:12.840 --> 27:15.840]  You know, if you add it up now, they just go, no, it never hurt anybody.
[27:15.840 --> 27:16.840]  It's a lie.
[27:16.840 --> 27:19.840]  Take it, take it, take it.
[27:19.840 --> 27:20.840]  Look at this.
[27:20.840 --> 27:29.840]  We've got a stack of news right here with Bill Melinda Gates's sub foundation with Bill and his dad edit last year getting awards.
[27:29.840 --> 27:40.840]  And Bill Gates and his father and photos of them in front of the foundation getting awards for it are there for funding the creation of the vaccine pathogen.
[27:40.840 --> 27:47.840]  What you need for the vaccine patting it for coronavirus.
[27:47.840 --> 27:49.840]  Unbelievable.
[27:49.840 --> 27:57.840]  And then they run the simulation three months ago and then they've got a Netflix show being promoted everywhere called pandemic that comes out right on time.
[27:57.840 --> 27:59.840]  It's a show.
[27:59.840 --> 28:01.840]  It's a pandemic when it's growing exponentially.
[28:01.840 --> 28:03.840]  It's growing exponentially.
[28:03.840 --> 28:10.840]  Just last week, they told us there was 2000 cases on Thursday than 3000 cases, supposedly on Friday.
[28:10.840 --> 28:14.840]  Now we're told, oh yeah, conservatively 300,000.
[28:14.840 --> 28:16.840]  Of course, it's way higher than that.
[28:16.840 --> 28:21.840]  There are hundreds of videos of people just dropping doctors dropping all sorts of this.
[28:21.840 --> 28:26.840]  This isn't some normal type.
[28:26.840 --> 28:29.840]  Pneumonia that kills you over a week.
[28:29.840 --> 28:38.840]  These people are, once it hits are dying very quickly having convulsions to create all the fear.
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.840]  Don't worry, they've got the solution.
[28:40.840 --> 28:43.840]  Global government forced inoculation.
[28:43.840 --> 28:46.840]  Bella Melinda Gates in the UN over the world.
[28:46.840 --> 28:50.840]  If you want to live, do what Bill Gates says.
[28:50.840 --> 28:57.840]  Roll up your sleeves or something special in the shot coming for you and your family.

[29:16.840 --> 29:24.840]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.

[31:31.840 --> 31:39.840]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago,
[31:39.840 --> 31:49.840]  I started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infohorsestore.com.

[31:58.840 --> 32:02.840]  Well, it's here, the year 2020. World government's out in the open.
[32:02.840 --> 32:06.840]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[32:06.840 --> 32:10.840]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place.
[32:10.840 --> 32:20.840]  It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[32:20.840 --> 32:30.840]  Wow. Yes, now we know we're right. The new world order's real, Satanism's real, the pedophile leader real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[32:30.840 --> 32:35.840]  But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[32:35.840 --> 32:38.840]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[32:38.840 --> 32:45.840]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[32:45.840 --> 32:50.840]  So it's an incredible time to be alive and I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[32:50.840 --> 32:57.840]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of mb4store.com is critical.
[32:57.840 --> 33:19.840]  Please take action.
[33:19.840 --> 33:24.840]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[33:24.840 --> 33:35.840]  Alex Jones.
[33:35.840 --> 33:37.840]  All right, here's what's going to happen.
[33:37.840 --> 33:39.840]  I'm going to lay out this news as calmly as I can.
[33:39.840 --> 33:48.840]  Then I'm going to get to a special report on Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and how they've got their fingerprints all over everything in a ridiculous way.
[33:48.840 --> 33:57.840]  It's like that exploding ink that they put when bank robbers come to the bank and say, stick them up, put the money in the bag and they put the exploding ink in it.
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.840]  Bill Gates and the UN and the deep state have just purple ink all over them.
[34:02.840 --> 34:04.840]  It's unbelievable.
[34:04.840 --> 34:18.840]  And the censorship of everyone that's exposed vaccine dangers and rigged pandemics and population control and secret experimentation has been astonishing the last six months.
[34:18.840 --> 34:28.840]  There has been a purge of everyone that has legitimately talked about this and they are busy pulling down videos of Bill Gates saying, I believe we need to depopulate the earth.
[34:28.840 --> 34:30.840]  My dad ran Planned Parenthood.
[34:30.840 --> 34:31.840]  There are too many people.
[34:31.840 --> 34:34.840]  They are pulling these everywhere.
[34:34.840 --> 34:39.840]  They're pulling videos of the head UN scientist saying, we have a vaccine damage cover up in a crisis.
[34:39.840 --> 34:46.840]  So their own people are going on record to cover their ass when this all comes out.
[34:46.840 --> 34:53.840]  But then the big tech who's buying into big pharma is covering it up on a planetary scale.
[34:53.840 --> 34:55.840]  So this is a big, big, big deal.
[34:55.840 --> 35:03.840]  And by the definition of pandemic, I added the point about exponential because that's what they really call a raging pandemic.
[35:03.840 --> 35:17.840]  When a pathogen is just exponentially growing, the definition was occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting a exceptionally high proportion of the population.
[35:17.840 --> 35:27.840]  An outbreak of a disease that occurs over a wide geographic area and affects an exceptionally high proportion of population, a pandemic outbreak of a disease.
[35:27.840 --> 35:38.840]  And you can pull up the quotes from Bill Gates and the UN and all these groups saying, we're going to use outbreaks to establish world government.
[35:38.840 --> 35:48.840]  We're going to use migration flows, outbreaks, economic crises and war to bring in world government, whether you like it or not.
[35:48.840 --> 36:00.840]  And just this week, it was at DeBose that George Soros said, we're going to stop nationalism.
[36:00.840 --> 36:09.840]  Nationalism is evil. We're getting rid of it and we're going to stop Trump and call him a bunch of names and call him a fascist.
[36:09.840 --> 36:11.840]  This is so transparent what's going on.
[36:11.840 --> 36:27.840]  And you have a history of the US government, of the scientific establishment, of the UN and of these pharmaceutical companies involved in massive illegal human testing and lethal testing on populations.
[36:27.840 --> 36:33.840]  And most big pharma is German. And I'm not knocking German people in general.
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.840]  Hell, I'm probably more German than anything else that are Welsh, but I got a lot of German on different sides of my family.
[36:38.840 --> 36:47.840]  Germans are great people, but Germany invented most of the modern pharmaceuticals and the chemical tech in the last 200 years.
[36:47.840 --> 36:53.840]  And if you look at Bayer and the rest of them, they're the folks that created Hitler.
[36:53.840 --> 37:00.840]  And so you saw what Hitler was doing with medical tyranny and their Nuremberg defense, you go read the Nuremberg transcripts online.
[37:00.840 --> 37:03.840]  There's thousands of pages of it, but it books have been written on it.
[37:03.840 --> 37:09.840]  And the Nazis got up and said, we got awards from the Rockefellers and Margaret Sanger and IBM.
[37:09.840 --> 37:15.840]  We had agreements with you. We had a treaty.
[37:15.840 --> 37:23.840]  They'd say, oops, adjourn. That's classified. And they would take Herman Göring in the back and shove cyanide in his mouth.
[37:23.840 --> 37:30.840]  The head of the SS had these agreements, too. That's why as soon as they got Heinrich Himmler, he was doing a secret peace deal before Hitler even got killed.
[37:30.840 --> 37:34.840]  He wanted to stop it before the Russians took over. The minute they grabbed Himmler, they killed his ass.
[37:34.840 --> 37:39.840]  Because Himmler's like, I've got the agreements with the King of England right here and the US government.
[37:39.840 --> 37:45.840]  They're like, you know you don't, buddy. So I'm not saying the US was bad.
[37:45.840 --> 38:01.840]  I'm saying this criminal scientific element that goes back to Sir Francis Galton in the 1850s was adopted by the British Royal House for the British Empire as a system of covert mind war and chemical and biological war and brainwashing.
[38:01.840 --> 38:07.840]  And everything you know today comes out of it.
[38:07.840 --> 38:13.840]  And you go, but you just said they were German. Well, technically the entire British Royal House is German.
[38:13.840 --> 38:27.840]  And then they're not even German because the original bloodlines are Hungarian and Romanian because that was the crossroads over a thousand years ago where the real power was at that time battling the Islamists and holding the line.
[38:27.840 --> 38:38.840]  And so Vlad the Impaler, the House Seal being a dragon, all that. That's a real person, folks. So the House of Windsor, the Saxe Cobra Gothas are the House of Dracula.
[38:38.840 --> 38:44.840]  Literally. That's why Bram Stoker wrote a book about it where there's a count and he's royal and he's Dracula.
[38:44.840 --> 38:53.840]  And so they're throwing it in your face and you look at this global map. It was the British had control of China before the Japanese went in there.
[38:53.840 --> 38:59.840]  And so the U.S. was in a covert war against the Japanese for at least two years with the British before they even attacked Pearl Harbor.
[38:59.840 --> 39:06.840]  I'm not defending the Japanese. This is just history. We were already at war with Japan when they struck attack Pearl Harbor.
[39:06.840 --> 39:15.840]  In their mind, they had no choice. But my point is, China's belonged to the globalists for hundreds of years and the globalists put the chai comms in power.
[39:15.840 --> 39:23.840]  So let's pull back and show the whole world. The globalists are using the Chinese people against America and against the world, but they're captives.
[39:23.840 --> 39:33.840]  That's why they let China buy most of our debt. That's why they let China buy up Hollywood because it's authoritarian state that will do as it's told to do.
[39:33.840 --> 39:41.840]  And Trump is trying to change all of that and have a new global balance based on trade and freedom and justice, not on this deep state globalist model.
[39:41.840 --> 39:49.840]  That's why they're so pissed. A pro-human model, not this 170-year-old British Empire model.
[39:49.840 --> 39:58.840]  And so that's the reality here. That's how the real world works. So yes, this virus is deadly. It's not like SARS and things that were just to hype up and scare people.
[39:58.840 --> 40:05.840]  They only killed a few hundred. This has already killed thousands and thousands. The videos are pouring out. The chai comms can't contain it.
[40:05.840 --> 40:13.840]  The censorship isn't working. And it does have a high kill rate. Hell, if it's five percent, it's devastating. Lands that says it can be high as 18 percent.
[40:13.840 --> 40:24.840]  Okay? Let's say it's one percent. It's going to be really, really bad. And I haven't made this announcement yet because I don't know how to make it.
[40:24.840 --> 40:31.840]  But if you go to infowars.com and you see the live feed headline, it's official. This is now a global pandemic.
[40:31.840 --> 40:50.840]  But what does it say right after that? U.S. officials believe that the virus has already broken out of containment on the West Coast in major cities like Seattle.
[40:50.840 --> 41:00.840]  They believe it. Now, I'm saying believe it. That's not really what they said. They said something else. I'm just saying I hope they're wrong.
[41:00.840 --> 41:11.840]  So I'm saying they believe. They believe it's broken containment with Chinese students that came in after the Chinese New Year.
[41:11.840 --> 41:18.840]  And they're preparing for massive emergencies and are trying to figure out how to announce it to the public. And I don't want panic.
[41:18.840 --> 41:26.840]  But they were saying it's fair money and panicking last week to say 40 something thousand at it. Now the Chinese government today said 300,000 probably do.
[41:26.840 --> 41:37.840]  And that's just in Wuhan. So this whole thing is out of control. Will you be praying about it? And I tell you, there's no silver bullet to all of this.
[41:37.840 --> 41:47.840]  But I personally have been taking vitamin D3 and vitamin K. We have winter sun in infowars.com. It's great.
[41:47.840 --> 41:52.840]  You should always be taking anyways in the winter because your skin produces the vitamin D3 from the sun.
[41:52.840 --> 41:59.840]  If it doesn't have it, you can take it under the tongue, high quality. I'm going to keep that discount so everybody can get it even though it's going to be sold out in a couple days at current sales rates.
[41:59.840 --> 42:07.840]  Also, we have the immune gargle that is tailor made with the nano silver in it in your mouth and to be able to wash with it.
[42:07.840 --> 42:14.840]  You can also, it's what's called immune gargle. You can also drink some of it. Read the indications on there, but it's authorized for that.
[42:14.840 --> 42:24.840]  And it's got a high antiviral aspect to it when so many other things don't work. All I'm saying is none of this is a silver bullet, but they call it silver bullet because silver is really, really good for you.
[42:24.840 --> 42:29.840]  And then when it comes to storeable foods, a lot of places have sold out to institutional groups, which is really scary.
[42:29.840 --> 42:35.840]  The group that we private label ours with is excellent and they drop ship every day. It's now seven to 10 days.
[42:35.840 --> 42:40.840]  If you order now to be able to have a guarantee to get it, if you order later, it'll probably be more.
[42:40.840 --> 42:46.840]  We are hoping for the best, preparing for the worst, but regardless, it's insurance. You can eat and it funds this operation.
[42:46.840 --> 42:52.840]  So infowarscore.com to find the full catalog of my Patriots supply, get the best deals and fund this operation.
[42:52.840 --> 43:11.840]  We'll be right back with a special report proving what Bill Gates is really up to.
[43:23.840 --> 43:27.840]  It's time to take a breather. Get chill for us today at infowarscore.com.
[43:27.840 --> 43:31.840]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.840]  Now we're bringing you an all new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.
[43:36.840 --> 43:52.840]  Ultra 12 from InfoWarsLife takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[43:52.840 --> 43:57.840]  Help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Ultra 12.
[43:57.840 --> 44:01.840]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[44:01.840 --> 44:08.840]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[44:08.840 --> 44:15.840]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[44:15.840 --> 44:24.840]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[44:24.840 --> 44:35.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[44:35.840 --> 44:39.840]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[44:39.840 --> 44:44.840]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[44:44.840 --> 44:49.840]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[44:49.840 --> 44:52.840]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[44:52.840 --> 44:58.840]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[44:58.840 --> 45:07.840]  This time of year, I'm always promoting Winter Sun, our high-quality, organic vitamin D3, vitamin K combo.
[45:07.840 --> 45:17.840]  Because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring that people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs,
[45:17.840 --> 45:25.840]  and then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there.
[45:25.840 --> 45:30.840]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses.
[45:30.840 --> 45:37.840]  So right now, we have Winter Sun still available, even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter and spring.
[45:37.840 --> 45:48.840]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23, despite the fact that I could sell it at full price because I want you to get it
[45:48.840 --> 45:51.840]  and I want to incentivize you protecting yourself and your family.
[45:51.840 --> 46:08.840]  So Winter Sun, taken out of the tongue, super high quality, 40% off, available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[46:22.840 --> 46:29.840]  Vitamin E and the incredible SilverSol formula, Infowars Silver Cream works triple beauty.
[46:29.840 --> 46:36.840]  Supporting the beautifying and protecting of the skin in a fast, non-greasy formula, small and easily stored.
[46:36.840 --> 46:42.840]  It can support dry and damaged skin to reduce fine lines and wrinkles while smoothing and softening calluses.
[46:42.840 --> 46:50.840]  With none of the harmful ingredients found in other formulas, you can be sure this silver cream is hard at work, promoting the healing of your skin.
[46:50.840 --> 46:58.840]  If you miss out on the new SilverSol power, can't miss formula. Get the Infowars Super Silver Cream today.
[47:20.840 --> 47:44.840]  The Globalists have told us that they're going to use controlled pandemics to take control of the planet.
[47:44.840 --> 47:50.840]  And they have a long history of releasing bio weapons and creating public health care.
[47:50.840 --> 47:59.840]  Every major western government, the Russians as well, the South Africans have been caught developing race specific bio weapons to wipe out certain races and people.
[47:59.840 --> 48:06.840]  This is all mainline science, mainline literature. Just like I tell you, 25 years ago they'd made human animal clones.
[48:06.840 --> 48:14.840]  That was in major scientific journals. It just wasn't popular news. Now you notice it's everywhere.
[48:14.840 --> 48:20.840]  Gene edited babies, human animal hybrids, it's all there. I'm just telling you what is known fact.
[48:20.840 --> 48:27.840]  Think about this. Bill Gates is the head science officer of this global corporate system.
[48:27.840 --> 48:31.840]  He's in the weather control, the genetic engineering. He runs it all.
[48:31.840 --> 48:37.840]  He's the guy the elite have decided because his dad had it up before to be in charge.
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.840]  He's the science officer of this nightmare cult.
[48:41.840 --> 48:47.840]  And the video that exposes it all is posted right now in infowars.com. Here it is. Please share it.
[48:47.840 --> 48:57.840]  A hundred years ago, a deadly influenza virus infected hundreds of millions of people, somewhere in the order of 50 to 100 million deaths.
[48:57.840 --> 49:03.840]  When we talk about another flu pandemic happening, it's not a matter of if, but when.
[49:03.840 --> 49:07.840]  The next pandemic is going to start and we just don't know where or how, but we know it will.
[49:07.840 --> 49:12.840]  That poses an existential threat to us as a species.
[49:12.840 --> 49:31.840]  Three months ago, in October of 2019, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation held a drill where they simulated the death of 65 million people from the imminent outbreak of a deadly virus coming out of China.
[49:31.840 --> 49:35.840]  Then that real virus suddenly appeared.
[49:35.840 --> 49:44.840]  Now we learn the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded another shadowy organization who patented the very coronavirus for a vaccine two years ago.
[49:44.840 --> 49:49.840]  Then we learn that a film has been in production for the last six months.
[49:49.840 --> 50:07.840]  A mini series, a docu-series for Netflix titled Pandemic, where Bill and Melinda Gates are the heroes at the end because they finance this intrepid scientist who's looking for a cure to all flu and a unified single vaccine.
[50:07.840 --> 50:11.840]  We're making a vaccine that could treat all future versions of flu.
[50:11.840 --> 50:15.840]  This vaccine could eradicate influenza as we know it.
[50:15.840 --> 50:27.840]  Bill Gates is the chief science officer of the private corporate world government working with John P. Holdren and others to carry out and execute this covert sterilization depopulation plan.
[50:27.840 --> 50:33.840]  Their operations are in memos like State Department memorandum 200 and others.
[50:33.840 --> 50:37.840]  It's actually part of a stated planetary goal.
[50:37.840 --> 50:43.840]  They need you to be ignorant and not aware of this for their operation to succeed.
[50:43.840 --> 50:58.840]  Even the head UN scientist and her colleagues came out in December and said vaccines are killing people, that the cover-up is imploding and that the frontline medical workers know the vaccines are hurting people and are not buying into the propaganda anymore.
[50:58.840 --> 51:09.840]  We really don't have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions because we're not able to give clear-cut answers.
[51:09.840 --> 51:22.840]  When people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets blown up in the media, one should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly is happening and what the cause of deaths are.
[51:22.840 --> 51:25.840]  But in most cases there's some obfuscation at that level.
[51:25.840 --> 51:40.840]  The first accusation is it is the adjuvant and yet without adjuvants we are not going to have the next generation of vaccines and many of the vaccines that we do have, ranging from tetanus through to HPV, require adjuvants in order for them to work.
[51:40.840 --> 51:53.840]  I give courses every year on how do you develop vaccines, how do you make vaccines and the first lesson is while you're making your vaccine if you can avoid using an adjuvant, please do so.
[51:53.840 --> 51:59.840]  The major health concern which we are seeing are accusations of long-term effects.
[51:59.840 --> 52:09.840]  We have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines.
[52:09.840 --> 52:23.840]  Even the frontline professionals are starting to question or they don't feel like they have enough confidence about the safety to stand up to it to the person asking them the questions.
[52:23.840 --> 52:32.840]  I mean most medical school curriculums, even nursing curriculums, I mean in medical school you're lucky if you have a half day on vaccines.
[52:32.840 --> 52:51.840]  That's why you see Bill and Melinda Gates funding and financing and casting themselves as heroes in this miniseries being pushed by Netflix and others trying to terrify you into accepting forced inoculation in the name of protecting your health.
[52:51.840 --> 53:05.840]  When in truth vaccines have been proven to lower immunity in most cases, to be filled with cancer viruses and other pathogens and to be a scourge from the technocrats, from the eugenicist in the last 60 to 70 years.
[53:05.840 --> 53:11.840]  When you pull back and you see all of this happening then you realize that Bill Gates leads a double life.
[53:11.840 --> 53:17.840]  He tells you that he wants to save the earth and save humans and that vaccines are the answer to make us healthy and live longer.
[53:17.840 --> 53:29.840]  But then he openly goes around bragging that we've got to reduce world population, that his father headed up Planned Parenthood and was involved in shadowy government operations for depopulation with Henry Kissinger
[53:29.840 --> 53:38.840]  and that we need to have equations cutting off carbon so that humans see our population numbers dwindle.
[53:38.840 --> 53:56.840]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average, the energy on average for each service and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[53:56.840 --> 54:01.840]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[54:01.840 --> 54:10.840]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. That's back from a high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[54:10.840 --> 54:17.840]  First we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people, that's headed up to about 9 billion.
[54:17.840 --> 54:27.840]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[54:27.840 --> 54:36.840]  The issue that really grabbed me as urgent were issues related to population, reproductive health.
[54:36.840 --> 54:41.840]  But did you come to reproductive issues as an intellectual?
[54:41.840 --> 54:56.840]  When I was growing up, my parents were always involved in various volunteer things. My dad had a Planned Parenthood and it was very controversial to be involved with that.
[54:56.840 --> 55:05.840]  This is what he's been saying on record, and he's involved in these productions where he's cast as the hero that come out right on time,
[55:05.840 --> 55:15.840]  so that we can learn to submit to the vaccine industry despite their secret courts and their secret coverups and all the billions of people that have been damaged by it.
[55:15.840 --> 55:19.840]  This is part of a larger global depopulation plan.
[55:19.840 --> 55:30.840]  It's part of this global corporate system wanting to have international law set the precedent that they can produce whatever drug or biological concoction they want
[55:30.840 --> 55:39.840]  and inject it into your body in the name of public safety and that secret vaccine courts already established here in the U.S. and being established worldwide
[55:39.840 --> 55:46.840]  will then carry out the coverups and payoffs to families whose children and others are maimed or killed.
[55:46.840 --> 55:52.840]  Behind closed doors on this New York campus, a secret gathering of some of the world's most powerful people.
[55:52.840 --> 56:01.840]  Gates, Buffett, Bloomberg, Winfrey. It was like, well, the new Superman and Wonder Woman, the super rich friends.
[56:01.840 --> 56:09.840]  Together with others at the meeting, including George Soros, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller, they're worth more than $125 billion.
[56:09.840 --> 56:17.840]  That much money, that much power around one table, it begs the question, what were they doing? What were they scheming?
[56:17.840 --> 56:19.840]  Total world domination?
[56:19.840 --> 56:22.840]  Bill Gates is on record saying he wants to sterilize you.
[56:22.840 --> 56:25.840]  Bill Gates is on record saying he wants to depopulate the earth.
[56:25.840 --> 56:33.840]  Bill Gates is on record supporting this his whole life and working with his family and others to execute this plan.
[56:33.840 --> 56:41.840]  It's up to you to research the facts and to decide whether you want to stand up against this and whether you want to live or you want to die.
[56:41.840 --> 56:44.840]  We are in charge of our children.
[56:44.840 --> 56:51.840]  The problem so widespread, the World Health Organization is calling the refusal to vaccinate one of the biggest threats of 2019.
[56:51.840 --> 56:55.840]  A healthy child has the ability to build up immunity naturally.
[56:55.840 --> 57:00.840]  I know that what I do is important to my patients, but what am I doing to myself and my family?
[57:00.840 --> 57:03.840]  Within one month, the virus can spread throughout the country.
[57:03.840 --> 57:05.840]  A month after that, widespread throughout the world.
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.840]  The next pandemic is going to start and we just don't know where or how, but we know it will.
[57:10.840 --> 57:15.840]  So now when you see propaganda pieces like this, you can see it through the lens of truth.
[57:15.840 --> 57:25.840]  For yourself and for your family's own safety, health and future, please research what I've said here today and find out it's far worse than I can even tell you.
[57:25.840 --> 57:36.840]  If you want to live, if you want to have any future, you need to understand this covert operation is deadly, is real and is happening now.
[57:36.840 --> 57:43.840]  And only by you becoming informed and warning others can we stop this nightmare before it's too late.
[57:43.840 --> 57:55.840]  Today with a shower number two, we now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China and the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[57:55.840 --> 58:04.840]  We know the virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries and many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States West Coast.
[58:04.840 --> 58:14.840]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out of supplies of affordable foods because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[58:14.840 --> 58:19.840]  That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[58:19.840 --> 58:25.840]  Info wars, private labels from my patriot supply and ships right out of the very same factory.
[58:25.840 --> 58:31.840]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a few weeks.
[58:31.840 --> 58:36.840]  And that people need to order now, they want to be able to get it within seven to 10 days.
[58:36.840 --> 58:39.840]  But if people wait, it may end up being longer.
[58:39.840 --> 59:08.840]  Get your order in now at infowarstore.com. You will be secured to get the food within seven to 10 days.
[59:08.840 --> 59:11.840]  And the family and the protection of the unborn. Wow.
[59:11.840 --> 59:17.840]  Yes, now we know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile a leader real.
[59:17.840 --> 59:20.840]  But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[59:20.840 --> 59:25.840]  But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[59:25.840 --> 59:29.840]  We have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter.
[59:29.840 --> 59:36.840]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[59:36.840 --> 59:40.840]  It's an incredible town to be alive. I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[59:40.840 --> 59:47.840]  But just remember your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of infowarstore.com is critical.
[59:47.840 --> 1:00:08.840]  So please take action.
[1:00:08.840 --> 1:00:18.840]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:25.840]  Look, I don't want to create a panic. But at the same time, I don't want to hold back information from you.
[1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:35.840]  And I have extremely powerful information. And then I was talking to Mike Adams, he has the same information from another high level source.
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:40.840]  Because this is going on big time, you can't contain the highest levels, what they know about the coronavirus.
[1:00:40.840 --> 1:00:45.840]  And the fact that obviously the biggest destination of foreigners isn't from Mexico now, it's from China.
[1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:50.840]  China is the main group coming here. They're flooding in back and forth all over the country.
[1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:55.840]  And the government knows that it's already broken out.
[1:00:55.840 --> 1:01:00.840]  Because before they even knew about this, people had it were coming over here to the West Coast.
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:06.840]  And so they're preparing to deal with that. We'll be talking about that more.
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:11.840]  But Nigel Farage is his own morning TV radio show. He's talking to a big journalist over in Asia.
[1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:15.840]  And this is some of what they talked about this morning.
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.840]  I'm fine Nigel. And let me wish you and your listeners a belated Happy New Year.
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:27.840]  Well, thank you. Now, Paul, we've spoken before when you as a foreign correspondent about the protests, etc.
[1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:34.840]  Now, I spoke this morning, I spoke this morning, Paul, to a family member who lives in Hong Kong.
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:41.840]  And he said the whole place is absolutely deserted and there is a genuine, he felt a genuine sense of fear.
[1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:45.840]  What's your reading of how Hong Kong is viewing this?
[1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:49.840]  Well, I've been here nearly a year with members of my family.
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:54.840]  I cover the whole of Asia Pacific area for the world media, as you probably know.
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:02:04.840]  And there are things I can tell you that this terrible virus is likely to go apoplectic.
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:11.840]  Very shortly, they're trying to cover it up. People in Hong Kong are really angry with Carrie Lam.
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:14.840]  I hope they don't throw me out for saying this.
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:24.840]  Well, Paul, they might well do. I'm so pleased you're on the line.
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:30.840]  We tried to speak today to expats in Wuhan, etc.
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:36.840]  And they were all very, very, very concerned about coming on the radio and talking to foreign media.
[1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:41.840]  So your feeling is this is worse than they're saying, yeah?
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:50.840]  Much worse. And there's never been a case. It's almost like a laboratory experiment, which has gone wild.
[1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:56.840]  You know, like a military thing. Now, I'm not being melodramatic. Like you, I've been in the media all my life.
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:01.840]  Someone has to tell the truth. I'm British. I want to tell you and the British people the truth.
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:13.840]  This border here in Hong Kong, because it's the special, you know, arrangement where they have autonomy, should have been closed by Carrie Lam.
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:16.840]  She takes orders from the boss in Beijing.
[1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:25.840]  So everybody's saying that there's two experienced doctors who are experts just dropped dead in Wuhan.
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:34.840]  We heard about that. Just drop dead after working on this. And there are members of the hospital staff, Nigel, that are dropping on the floor.
[1:03:34.840 --> 1:03:42.840]  That doesn't sound like the flu to me. It's much worse. There are people usually get 60 million visitors a year.
[1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:48.840]  I'm looking out at the downtown Hong Kong now in one shy from my hotel. It's like a graveyard.
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:58.840]  There's hardly anybody. People are terrified. And the government is trying to play it down, including other governments.
[1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:03.840]  Oh, that's all right. It'll calm down. You and I know better, Nigel.
[1:04:03.840 --> 1:04:05.840]  Yeah, but it's really bad.
[1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:16.840]  But if people are stuck at home and from what we can make out in Wuhan, people are stuck at home and you've absolutely confirmed what I got from my family member earlier on this morning.
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:20.840]  I mean, there comes a point after a couple of days where people have to go out and buy food and things like that.
[1:04:20.840 --> 1:04:26.840]  So people can't live in self-imposed quarantine forever, can they?
[1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:34.840]  No, I'm eating chocolate biscuits and whatever's left in my coffee. I went to seven food stores in two days. They're all closed early.
[1:04:34.840 --> 1:04:40.840]  And when I went to McDonald's, which is terrible food, I hope I'm not saying anything about these sponsors.
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:44.840]  Well, it's all a matter of opinion, Paul. It's all a matter of taste.
[1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:49.840]  We're going to go to break. That's just a flavor of what's going on there in Hong Kong.
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:56.840]  And we've got the big breaking news from China and from places like Seattle when we come back.
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:02.840]  We've got three big sales going right now and one of them has to end within a week.
[1:05:02.840 --> 1:05:10.840]  And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off. It's amazing. Go check it out for yourself.
[1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:19.840]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling deep earth crystals iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:26.840]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is. The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:31.840]  So just check it out for yourself. 40% off in four store.com and it funds the M4.
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:38.840]  And then vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together. Super high quality winter sun.
[1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:42.840]  You don't have sun during the winter. Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:44.840]  That's why people get so sick. That's the main reason.
[1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:48.840]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption. It's amazing.
[1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:53.840]  All three of these are on sale but only for a limited time at M4store.com.
[1:05:53.840 --> 1:06:13.840]  Protect yourself and fund the M4. 360 win.
[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:17.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, the quick heading is here.
[1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:26.840]  This is just some of the news that's on M4Wars.com video. John Bolton reportedly seen wandering around Qatar.
[1:06:26.840 --> 1:06:31.840]  Over the former national security device we'll be doing in the Middle East when he's supposedly star witness to bring down Trump.
[1:06:31.840 --> 1:06:36.840]  And then footage I'm going to air at the bottom of the hour. I was in there watching C-Span.
[1:06:36.840 --> 1:06:39.840]  It wasn't on Fox because they're talking over it during the break.
[1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:44.840]  And there was a press conference with Schumer saying maybe Trump's a Russians agent.
[1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:48.840]  Maybe he works for the Chinese Communist. Maybe he works for this or that.
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:55.840]  I mean, this is reached next level. But he's saying we're getting him out of there one way or the other.
[1:06:55.840 --> 1:07:02.840]  So now they're saying any action of the president to talk to anybody is espionage because they're the ones in bed with the Chai comms.
[1:07:02.840 --> 1:07:07.840]  Everything they're guilty of, they've got to project on President Trump and the media will repeat it.
[1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:12.840]  So now Schumer rolled that out. That's being posted at M4Wars.com right now.
[1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:18.840]  At the bottom of the hour. Then we've got stuff like this breaking from Jamie White in M4Wars.com.
[1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:22.840]  Bombshell video. Two more. That's up to five.
[1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:26.840]  Bernie's staffers promote extreme action and property destruction.
[1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:33.840]  Putting people in camps. You name it. That's all coming up.
[1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:38.840]  They've got Palestinian leader Reject Trump's offer to discuss the deal of the century peace plan.
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:45.840]  I have a whole stack of reports of white people being attacked everywhere by groups of black people and the media trying to cover it up or praising it.
[1:07:45.840 --> 1:07:50.840]  So that's the race war they're trying to start. We need to come together, folks, not kill each other. This is insane.
[1:07:50.840 --> 1:08:04.840]  Meanwhile, major universities are now going to make U.S. students starting with Missouri wear trackable chips and track everywhere you go to attend the university.
[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:11.840]  I mean, this is beyond 1984. Beyond what the Chai comms are doing. It's all coming up.
[1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:17.840]  I don't think there's ever been a more important time to have Mike Adams on. He's an engineer. He owns a major testing lab.
[1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:25.840]  He's a big author. He's got businesses in China and Hong Kong. His wife's Taiwanese. He speaks fluent Chinese.
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:31.840]  And he's got the sources over there. He's been spot on the last two weeks, intensely reporting on this.
[1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:37.840]  That's why he's being hacked. He's being blocked. They've done federal injunctions in California against him.
[1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:42.840]  His name is not even on the paperwork, but they're just doing it, trying to shut him down because they're so scared right now.
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:45.840]  They're making their move. They're pulling the same stuff to us behind the scenes.
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:51.840]  I'm not going to make us the story because things are so serious, but we're seeing escalations we've never seen.
[1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:57.840]  Last week, I said, maybe they're getting ready to kill Trump or crash the economy. I hadn't put two together with the virus.
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:03.840]  This is it. Global pandemic, ladies and gentlemen. Now, listen, the first patient zero was in Seattle, Washington.
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:10.840]  Tens of thousands of Chinese students come back from the Chinese New Year and they came back in the last two weeks.
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:16.840]  Eight to ten day incubation. Many people don't show signs of fever when they have it.
[1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:25.840]  And so I have sources and I was talking to Mike this morning. He contacted me separately and we're not saying this is happening.
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:30.840]  But clearly, when you've got thousands of people coming back, some of them are going to have the virus.
[1:09:30.840 --> 1:09:33.840]  It's now showing up in Germany, it's showing up in France, it's showing up all over.
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:40.840]  And if it spreads so fast, even through the eyes, it's going to end up breaking out on a larger scale.
[1:09:40.840 --> 1:09:47.840]  I think that's a safe bet. I think I'd say about a 99 percent chance that we're going to see thousands of cases in the U.S. conservatively.
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:50.840]  If it doesn't happen, great, but the global maps are clear.
[1:09:50.840 --> 1:09:57.840]  So Mike Adams, a scientist, he's reading what the scientists are saying. He was saying two days ago, 44,000 projection by the Hong Kong University.
[1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:02.840]  Now the Chinese government this morning said 300,000 is the projection currently.
[1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:06.840]  And it's a ghost town in cities of 11 million people where you can normally not walk down the street.
[1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:09.840]  So Mike Adams is here with us for the next three segments.
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:15.840]  We're going to cover the virus right now and the response to it, the vaccine and the wings, all of this.
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:19.840]  Mike Adams, thank you of naturalnews.com.
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:22.840]  Thank you for having me on, Alex. Let me give you the updates right away.
[1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:31.840]  Number one, last night news broke that this virus can be spread through casual contact that doesn't require any exchange of liquids or even aerosolized liquids such as saliva.
[1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:39.840]  You can catch this virus by shaking someone's hand or just touching someone in a casual way, in a social way, in a business way, shaking hands.
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:42.840]  So that means it can live a while outside the body.
[1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:44.840]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:49.840]  The second thing to realize is that every one person is infecting two to three people.
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:53.840]  So the exponential growth of this is either squared or cubed.
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:11:04.840]  Now, when you do the math on this, for epidemiologists will know this, but if you have one person giving it to three people, then you have to, in order to stop this from spreading,
[1:11:04.840 --> 1:11:11.840]  you have to stop about 75% of transmission by forcing people into quarantines.
[1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:16.840]  You have to close society. You have to shut it down and send everybody home.
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:20.840]  China is already closing schools until March in that region.
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:28.840]  And if they start sending everybody home from all the businesses, all the factories, all the production centers, China is going to suffer major economic impacts.
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:37.840]  And I want you to imagine, too, and for your audience, Alex, what if the United States government eventually tells the truth about this and tells people to stay home?
[1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:43.840]  Who runs the power plants? Who runs the water treatment plants? Who runs the telecommunications infrastructure?
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:46.840]  Who responds to your 911 calls?
[1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:52.840]  If people are forced to stay home because that's the only way to stop the spread of this, society ceases to function.
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:12:02.840]  And separately, we already know from multiple sources now that this outbreak is uncontained in the United States along the West Coast.
[1:12:02.840 --> 1:12:16.840]  It is uncontained. They don't have this under control. And I've even been sent a document that shows that the PCR genetic sequencing libraries are being pushed out in panic mode by the CDC.
[1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:25.840]  They still don't have a grip on the exact gene sequence of this. They keep shipping out updates, and it's a statistical match that isn't 100%.
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:32.840]  So there's still a lot of wishy-washyness on the lab side of this of how to identify whether a person has it or doesn't have it.
[1:12:32.840 --> 1:12:39.840]  By the way, just while I've been sitting here today, more red dots are popping up in India and in Australia and in Europe.
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:42.840]  This looks like something out of a movie.
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:49.840]  Well, a human-to-human transmission in country is now confirmed in Taiwan and in Japan. Looks like Canada as well.
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:54.840]  And of course, Germany has a patient now, but not in-country transmission in Germany yet.
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:59.840]  But this is already, this should be the highest level of alert at the WHO.
[1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:04.840]  And yet they have not determined that. They haven't announced that yet.
[1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:13.840]  Remember how quick they were to announce phase five and phase six pandemics when it was a hoax in the years past with bird flu and so on?
[1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:19.840]  And now when this is really spreading, they're not announcing it. So it really makes you wonder.
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:24.840]  Right to say the global pandemic is here. I mean, it's exponential. It's large numbers and it's all over the world.
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:26.840]  Is that the definition?
[1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:36.840]  It is. It's a global pandemic. And by the way, the media in America is now complicit in the cover-up that may cost millions of people their lives.
[1:13:36.840 --> 1:13:42.840]  The media will get people killed. And the same media that pushes transgenderism, what are they going to do next?
[1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:48.840]  Push trans-viralism? Like the cure is to self-identify as a person who doesn't have the virus?
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:54.840]  Hey, we don't need hospitals in California. Just be a trans-viralist person. Just pretend you don't have it.
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:14:04.840]  They don't believe in biology, Alex. How are we supposed to sound the alarm on something that's real when you have an entire left-wing media that does not believe in biological reality or genetics?
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:12.840]  How are you supposed to deal with this? And when they get infected, are they going to pretend they're not infected? Or will they have a wake-up call?
[1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:21.840]  You've been harping and so have I for more than three weeks that this could be a bio-weapon release to bring down the global economy as a way to counter nationalism.
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:25.840]  And the globalists have said bad economies will hurt nationalists and hurt Trump.
[1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:36.840]  Xi says China fighting demon virus has contagion spreads. And I've got the reports here where mainline analyst groups are saying this could cause a global depression.
[1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:40.840]  So this is really getting serious.
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:45.840]  This will put Trump's reelection at risk because it puts the U.S. stock market at risk.
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:53.840]  However, my current analysis, Alex, is that this was a bio-weapon, yes, but it was accidentally released in China.
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:15:00.840]  Accidentally got out of the lab. In other words, infected monkeys bit or scratched the science workers there.
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:06.840]  Just like a movie. Lands that reports they've done this four times before with SARS, which is the same family.
[1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:12.840]  They've had four incidents before with SARS and SARS, by the way, shares 80% of the genome of this coronavirus.
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:16.840]  So it's very similar in terms of its genetic analysis.
[1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:26.840]  But coronavirus has the added attribute of being able to spread during the incubation period, which means people who don't even know they have it are spreading it to others, family members, friends and coworkers.
[1:15:26.840 --> 1:15:29.840]  This is way worse than SARS ever could have been.
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:38.840]  Which we would always explain is a hoax, is hype, is to get the pharmaceutical industry an excuse to fair monger, get you to take vaccines and get a bunch of research money.
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:48.840]  Now, though, it's got Bill and Melinda Gates fingerprints, you and fingerprints all over it, and they want it to really, really get bad, I guess, until they make that announcement, until they have the vaccine ready.
[1:15:48.840 --> 1:15:59.840]  We'll talk about it with Mike Adams on the other side, tell everybody you know, tune in now, this is vital.
[1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:24.840]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security IPO or note.

[1:17:18.840 --> 1:17:31.840]  Oh, can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.

[1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:38.840]  So we know the first confirmed case in the United States last week was in Seattle.
[1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:44.840]  I have sources in industry that have talked to all the big storable foods, company heads,
[1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:51.840]  and institutional buyers started early last week buying up all the food they had.
[1:20:51.840 --> 1:20:58.840]  Then it exploded, and by Friday, basically everybody was sold out except a few suppliers that are amongst the biggest,
[1:20:58.840 --> 1:21:01.840]  like my Patriot supply that we private label from, literally.
[1:21:01.840 --> 1:21:05.840]  Other places are telling you they're going to have storable food, but they're already sold out.
[1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:09.840]  My Patriot is boxing and making it as fast as they can as it's fresh.
[1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:14.840]  When you get it through InfoWars.com, that helps fund us, but it's the exact same assembly line.
[1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:19.840]  Just our stickers are thrown on it, InfoWars Select, and that was done before, so we can offer you an even lower price.
[1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:29.840]  But I'm not engaged in a plug here as much as I am explaining that talking to the folks there,
[1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:35.840]  they said, yeah, it's big institutional buyers, not just us, but other folks, obviously they can't say who the customers are,
[1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:38.840]  but it's governmental and things like that, it's corporations.
[1:21:38.840 --> 1:21:42.840]  And I said, let me guess, the West Coast, and they said, yeah, of course, West Coast.
[1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:45.840]  And they said, Seattle.
[1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:52.840]  Well, obviously that's the first place that's one of the biggest Chinese cities here in the United States.
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:54.840]  That's where all the students are at.
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:57.840]  This is extremely disgusting what's going on.
[1:21:57.840 --> 1:22:02.840]  And the fact that it is being played down when they hyped up all these other events that weren't big
[1:22:02.840 --> 1:22:06.840]  shows that when it's not a real threat, they hype it up to create fear.
[1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:10.840]  But when it is a real event, now they're trying to shut everything down
[1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:13.840]  and they've been caught suppressing so far and have been proven lying.
[1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:15.840]  I don't want to hurt the economy.
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:18.840]  And I don't want to even see China hurt.
[1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:19.840]  And the common is Chinese.
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:21.840]  But reality is reality.
[1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:26.840]  And as the Chinese people revolt, that's in the news, and say it's all a huge lie, a lot more dying.
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:27.840]  There's a cover-up.
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:28.840]  We've got reports on that.
[1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:32.840]  As the same thing happens in Hong Kong and surrounding areas, that's kind of hurt overall confidence.
[1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:39.840]  My God, I'm sure a smart guy, even mainline news is saying now that it looks like the virus may have been stolen
[1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:42.840]  by Chai Combs out of a Canadian lab.
[1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:43.840]  Some of the same people were involved.
[1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:45.840]  It turns out in weird stuff with Ebola.
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:51.840]  I mean, this sounds like a movie script for a horror movie.
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:54.840]  What do you really think is going on here?
[1:22:54.840 --> 1:23:00.840]  Well, isn't it interesting that what we were saying three or four or five days ago that was immediately called fake news
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:03.840]  by the mainstream media, now they are reporting and confirming.
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:06.840]  So we weren't fake news.
[1:23:06.840 --> 1:23:09.840]  We were ahead of their news, as usual, right?
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:11.840]  Infowars is tomorrow's news today.
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:20.840]  But look, right now, flights from China are arriving in U.S. cities every hour of the day to Los Angeles, Boston, New York.
[1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:24.840]  Flights are arriving to Vancouver and Toronto and Canada.
[1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:29.840]  Flights are going to London and Moscow and places all over the world.
[1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:31.840]  This is happening right now.
[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:33.840]  It is spreading around the world.
[1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:41.840]  So even if China has their draconian lockdown and their military enforced quarantines, other countries, it's already too late.
[1:23:41.840 --> 1:23:43.840]  Alex, that's the big message today.
[1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:45.840]  This is already broken in containment.
[1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:48.840]  This is out of control in the United States.
[1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:51.840]  We're just not getting the truth about it yet.
[1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:53.840]  The numbers are still relatively low.
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:57.840]  It roughly takes about a week for the number of infected patients to double.
[1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:09.840]  But the denialism now, especially among the left-wing media, this biological and genetic denialism, the science illiteracy among the left-wing media, is going to make this pandemic worse.
[1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:16.840]  So as this spreads and people start dying, it literally will be the fault of the left-wing media for not telling the truth up front.
[1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:18.840]  Let me ask you this though.
[1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:34.840]  Indonesia, Malaysia, North Korea, now South Korea, the Philippines, they're either totally stopping all flights or quarantining people and kicking people out that just arrived in the last 10 days because they could be viral carriers.
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:35.840]  That's common sense.
[1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:46.840]  Why in Hades has Trump, who did travel restrictions from six Islamic countries, where they said, will blow you up and don't have real passport rules and let terrorists get on flights? That's totally normal.
[1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:55.840]  It's reasonable. Why isn't Trump saying, no, sorry, no Chinese coming into the United States while we see how bad this is for, say, a week or so?
[1:24:55.840 --> 1:24:57.840]  Exactly. It's a huge question.
[1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:12.840]  And my criticism of the president on this issue comes from two different vectors here. Number one, the president, he's a very successful business person, a very intelligent person, but he does not have experience in epidemiology or virology or laboratory analytics or healthcare issues.
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:17.840]  That's not his area of expertise. So he's relying on experts who are no doubt lying to him.
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:22.840]  And they could be telling him everything's okay, so when this goes south, he gets the blame.
[1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:28.840]  That's exactly right. And since he doesn't have the background in this area, he doesn't know how to ask the right questions or demand the right evidence.
[1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:38.840]  It's not a criticism of his intelligence. No one can be an expert in everything. And he's very successful in his own way, you know, in many ways, but he's being lied to. No question about it.
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:48.840]  And secondly, I think that Trump is very much concerned that any loss of faith in the stock market could impact his reelection chances.
[1:25:48.840 --> 1:25:49.840]  He's right.
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:58.840]  So, you know, a bubble market depends on irrational exuberance. And you know what shatters irrational exuberance is fear, fear of the unknown.
[1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:04.840]  That's what causes people to sell stocks and pull in their investments and stop leveraging and so on.
[1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:12.840]  And right now this bubble market is such a bubble, just as Geltzel empty reports, you know, on your show frequently, the bubble is vulnerable to fear.
[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:20.840]  So fear must be controlled, which means right now they're going to have to cover this up for a long time, even as the infections get worse.
[1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:23.840]  That's the story.
[1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:32.840]  And China wants to cover it up for the same economic reasons, by the way, China has a bubble in its own way, and it's involved in trade war negotiations with the United States.
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:35.840]  China depends on factories running to keep the exports going.
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:40.840]  And America depends on people showing up and going to work to keep everything running.
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:45.840]  You know, society breaks down very quickly if people stop going to work, if they're told to stay home.
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:50.840]  I mean, think about this. A 15 percent fatality rate sounds bad enough.
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:56.840]  But if society stops functioning, the fatality rate across the board will be much larger than 15 percent.
[1:26:56.840 --> 1:27:00.840]  And we know everything the globalists have been doing is trying to trigger that.
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:05.840]  So if you're saying that China comms have this in a lab and let it out, which is more, more people are saying probably what happened.
[1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:06.840]  They've done it before.
[1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:10.840]  That would then cut below Melinda Gates and the whole deep state out of this.
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:20.840]  You see all them with their tabletop exercises, their Netflix shows coming out, all the pre-programming, banning all the people exposing these labs and vaccine dangers the last six months.
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:25.840]  There's been a big buildup to this that makes makes me think it's a lot bigger than just an accident in the lab.
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:32.840]  Well, as I mentioned yesterday on your show, Alex, I believe that they were working on this strain and they they were not yet ready to release it.
[1:27:32.840 --> 1:27:38.840]  They probably needed a few more tweaks to make it even more deadly, but it got out before they were ready to release it.
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:41.840]  I don't believe they would have released it in China on purpose.
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:46.840]  I think they would have released it in Africa or perhaps in North America or Mexico.
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:51.840]  Exactly. China is not going to want to get the blame of this.
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:28:10.840]  I think I think China, their long term goal as a strategic weapon would have been to send send an infected human like a suicide mission, a viral kamikaze, if you will, into Los Angeles or New York City and release it there just by walking around and shaking hands,
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:13.840]  you know, touching doorknobs, touching handrails.
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:14.840]  That's how you spread this.
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:15.840]  That's all it takes.
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:26.840]  So again, this is a deliberate bio weapon that I believe has been accidentally released and China is about to pay a serious price for playing with God.
[1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:28.840]  Mike, do one more segment with us.
[1:28:28.840 --> 1:28:29.840]  I will.
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:32.840]  And then I'm going to get to the latest on the trial and open the phones up.
[1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:33.840]  And oh, Dr. Steve McChennick's coming on.
[1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:35.840]  I should have said something about that.
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:36.840]  Wow.
[1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:41.840]  So big broadcast left today and then the war room today.
[1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:47.840]  If Owen Troyer is able to, he was able to not able to go to DC, he got sick in the DC jail, came back to Austin's real sick.
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:50.840]  So he's supposed to be in court again yesterday, didn't able to make it.
[1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:52.840]  Maybe he'll be able to host the show today.
[1:28:52.840 --> 1:28:53.840]  If not, maybe I'll be there.
[1:28:53.840 --> 1:29:19.840]  Stay with us.
[1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:45.840]  Thank you.
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:57.840]  Thank you.
[1:29:57.840 --> 1:30:23.840]  Thank you.
[1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:49.840]  Thank you.
[1:30:49.840 --> 1:31:15.840]  Thank you.
[1:31:15.840 --> 1:31:41.840]  Thank you.
[1:31:41.840 --> 1:31:57.840]  Thank you.
[1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:22.840]  This should really be easier than it is.
[1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:48.840]  Thank you.
[1:32:48.840 --> 1:33:10.840]  Thank you.
[1:33:18.840 --> 1:33:44.840]  Thank you.
[1:33:44.840 --> 1:34:13.840]  Thank you.
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:39.840]  Thank you.
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:35:07.840]  Thank you.
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:33.840]  Thank you.
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:59.840]  Thank you.
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:25.840]  Thank you.
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:51.840]  Thank you.
[1:36:51.840 --> 1:37:17.840]  Thank you.
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:43.840]  Thank you.
[1:37:43.840 --> 1:38:09.840]  Thank you.
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:35.840]  Thank you.
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:39:01.840]  Thank you.
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:27.840]  Thank you.
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:53.840]  Thank you.
[1:39:53.840 --> 1:40:19.840]  Thank you.
[1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:45.840]  Thank you.
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:41:11.840]  Thank you.
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:37.840]  Thank you.
[1:41:37.840 --> 1:42:05.840]  Thank you.
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:31.840]  Thank you.
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:57.840]  Thank you.
[1:42:57.840 --> 1:43:23.840]  Thank you.
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:49.840]  Thank you.
[1:43:49.840 --> 1:44:17.840]  Thank you.
[1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:43.840]  Thank you.
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:45:09.840]  Thank you.
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:37.840]  Thank you.
[1:45:37.840 --> 1:46:03.840]  Thank you.
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:29.840]  Thank you.
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:57.840]  Thank you.
[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:23.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:31.840]  I'm Alex Jones your host Mike Adams is our guest he's the health ranger he's an engineer scientist on the research lab as a publisher
[1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:39.840]  and he's got employees in Hong Kong in Taiwan and does business there as a publishing company.
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:49.840]  What's the word you're getting from them there because they're claiming 4,000 in fact 106 dead but now the Chinese government saying as many as 300,000 could have it.
[1:47:49.840 --> 1:48:00.840]  What makes this virus so special. How bad do you think it'll get on them on the drastic end versus a good scenario gut level. What are you projecting.
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:09.840]  Well let's first talk about how China is covering up the number of infections. And this is reporting that came out of the epoch times we've covered it since at natural news.
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:20.840]  It has a source frontline insider who tells them that China is creating artificial scarcity in the availability of diagnostic testing kits.
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:31.840]  In order to make sure that you know people samples aren't taken from patients that might be infected now, according to that report, only 10% of the requested kits are being delivered.
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:48.840]  China is saying right now I think 4,600 roughly people infected. The real number is certainly 10 times higher, which would put it at 46,000 which is consistent with the 44,000 projection that was put out a couple days ago by Hong Kong University
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:49:03.840]  scientific researchers. So in every scenario here if you look at the reality, it looks like there's at least 44,000 people infected and that was several days ago so the real number is probably now much much higher closer to 90,000 100,000 perhaps even higher.
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:12.840]  The other thing to realize Alex and I can speak on this because we do microbiology tests in our globally accredited laboratory we test for microbiology.
[1:49:12.840 --> 1:49:24.840]  They are using PCR gene sequencing technology in order to detect this virus that technology is slower than you might think that PCR replication can take about 30 hours per sample.
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:32.840]  The backlog of samples is no doubt enormous by now sample prep is a very manually labor intensive process.
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:45.840]  And even once you finish the sample prep you put them into what's called 96 well plates, the plates go into the gene sequencing instruments. The instruments return a statistical analysis of the genetic code, not a yes no answer.
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:56.840]  You then have to interpret those data to find out whether there is a match for the proteins in the library, the software library that's being distributed by the CDC and the CDC.
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:50:07.840]  I've been given documents showing that they are panic updating those libraries now almost every day, because they haven't quite nailed down exactly what's the gene sequence for this coronavirus.
[1:50:07.840 --> 1:50:17.840]  So there's all kinds of gray areas here there are delays and lab testing. There's no such thing as a kit that just tests in five minutes like a like a pregnancy test doesn't exist for the coronavirus.
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:26.840]  So people the numbers you're getting out of China are one tenth the reality and the numbers you're getting from the CDC are most likely three to four weeks behind schedule.
[1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:33.840]  Understand the importance of this if the CDC says there are 10 people let's say in America that's 10 people weeks ago.
[1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:37.840]  What's actually happening now they won't know for a few more weeks.
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:44.840]  And I again I can speak to this as an owner of a multimillion dollar analytical laboratory facility that's ISO accredited.
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:50.840]  So we're not being told the truth. There's no way they could be running these tests in a timely manner and turning them around quickly.
[1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:57.840]  It's not happening. There are going to be a lot more infections that are that are diagnosed in the days ahead Alex.
[1:50:57.840 --> 1:51:04.840]  And as you said earlier, when they had all the SARS and bird flu hysteria that was way over exaggerated we said that then.
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:14.840]  And when there's real pandemics we found going back six years ago all over the country the reports from listeners my own family lost three people in one town.
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:19.840]  The hospital doctor said oh this is some super pneumonia virus. They're covering it up. We've never seen somebody dead.
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:24.840]  There were articles here and there around the country mainly at the south of places like Texas.
[1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:30.840]  But but all the way up into Illinois people knew hey they're covering something up. There's a lot of funerals going on.
[1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:42.840]  The real I've noticed they cover it up when it's not they hype it to get power and that's what scares me concerns me motivates me to get ready is that is that they're covering this up so much.
[1:51:42.840 --> 1:51:55.840]  You've nailed it and it's the liberal cities along the West Coast that are the most vulnerable to this for reasons you know a filthy lack of public health feces in the streets mass homelessness needle sharing.
[1:51:55.840 --> 1:52:06.840]  When you combine that with the now science denialism of the left wing media that tends to provide the propaganda to the residents of left wing cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles.
[1:52:06.840 --> 1:52:14.840]  You are really creating a perfect storm situation for a worst case outbreak in those areas. Now you asked me what's the best case.
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:23.840]  Well the best case is that they get this contained they isolate everybody they put everybody under orders go home stay home for weeks.
[1:52:23.840 --> 1:52:33.840]  Everybody spreads it and then this whole thing is done in two to three weeks. Now if you think that's going to happen then you believe in magic because there's no way that's going to happen.
[1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:41.840]  It's not going to be the best case scenario. How bad will it get. We won't know for sure until we continue to monitor this over the next several weeks.
[1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:50.840]  Remember it takes about a week for the number of infected people to double. So every week is a doubling of the seven days and then seven days and then seven days.
[1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:56.840]  Which is interesting by the way from Bible scholars because you know you talk about seven seals and the seven signs.
[1:52:56.840 --> 1:53:04.840]  You know I'm not an expert in that area but they keep telling me this repeated number seven seven seven has a lot to do with sort of end time scripture.
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:09.840]  I'm sure you have other guests who could speak to that more in a more informed way than I could.
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:19.840]  Well we know this the globalists have said they're going to bring in world government using bio weapons and then each bio weapon will get worse than the earlier ones are just test to get us ready.
[1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:27.840]  And so we're going to be watching all this very very carefully but the preparation of the UN and the deep state for all this has been very very creepy.
[1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:38.840]  And we'll just have to track the whole thing is an unfolds Mike and closing because it is growing exponentially we know that depending on their low numbers or the high numbers that are out there.
[1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:49.840]  How long would it take at current rates of just ballpark do you think for it to really be some of their having to cover up in the US three weeks four weeks from now or how long.
[1:53:49.840 --> 1:53:57.840]  Probably they could they could cover it up for the next two months I would imagine you know the Hong Kong researchers estimated that this would peak in China by early May.
[1:53:57.840 --> 1:54:05.840]  And at that time there would be 150,000 cases per day which you couldn't even diagnose there's not even the lab bandwidth to do that.
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:09.840]  That's why they're racing building all these hospitals. That's right that's right.
[1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:21.840]  You know 100,000 new beds expansion was just announced by the mayor of the Wuhan city there 100,000 hospital beds for an infection that China says is only affecting you know 4000 something people.
[1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:34.840]  But if this were to peak in the United States under those models the peak in the USA would probably be June July August sometime around there and the left wing media and the CDC could cover this up for for a couple of months.
[1:54:34.840 --> 1:54:40.840]  I believe and they could say it's something else or they could blame climate change you know people are getting sick because of climate change.
[1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:45.840]  It's Trump's fault you know whatever it's insane they don't follow any rules of science anymore.
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:59.840]  They've now announced officially that Trump may be a Russian spy or a Chinese spy they said who knows he just when he talks to foreign leaders it's wrong and the president talking to people as espionage.
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:05.840]  I'm going to play the clip when we start the next hour the Dr. Steve Pachinic joins us. Mike Adams at naturalloose.com thank you you're doing an amazing job.
[1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:09.840]  Thank you Alex.
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:21.840]  Chinese government keeping coronavirus infection numbers artificially low by limiting supply of medical testing kits that's the new article at naturalloose.com we also have it posted at info wars.com and please remember listeners.
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:30.840]  They're hacking us around the clock they're hammering us they're trying to shut us down around the clock right now you see the demonization stories in the New York Times.
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:37.840]  Articles last night saying should I be arrested for questioning Sandy Hooks and now they've moved on to well maybe he'll just be arrested.
[1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:50.840]  And bizarre weird filings and courts against me that are fraudulent going on just like Mike Adams in bankruptcy courts and stuff just just random stuff is really crazy and people putting out on the Internet.
[1:55:50.840 --> 1:55:53.840]  Where I live and saying go get me.
[1:55:53.840 --> 1:56:01.840]  I mean the deep state as I've been saying last few weeks is moving quick and fast and being very aggressive not just with me but with a lot of other folks.
[1:56:01.840 --> 1:56:07.840]  So I said something big is about to happen something big and I think it's probably the virus and what it's going to do the economy.
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:14.840]  And I kind of get why Trump's not hyping it up at the same time if they don't contain it which I don't think they can do.
[1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:22.840]  Then once people learn it's been covered up they're going to get pissed I think I think the president and others can't wait on this.
[1:56:22.840 --> 1:56:30.840]  And as you say well we've had big outbreaks before and you know there's going to be preparations and things that need to happen and this could end up happening here or you know here's the good end here's the bad end.
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:35.840]  But I just think this putting it off this waiting this waiting with something that looks like it's going to be this big is dangerous.
[1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:37.840]  What do you think.
[1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:40.840]  You know I know they're just going to have open phones today on the war room.
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:47.840]  But Savannah Hernandez and Tom Papert he was in D.C. jail for having a piece of tape over his mouth and no one's very sick right now in bed.
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:57:00.840]  So I'm sure it won't be hosting that and I'm tempted to just co-host with them as well or obviously come in here tonight with more of the Senate trial and cover that because I haven't even gotten to all the other news yet.
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:03.840]  When we come back ahead of Pachennik I'm going to play this clip.
[1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:08.840]  It's been posted on info wars dot com and news wars dot com haven't even thought of the headline.
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:14.840]  Chuck E. Schumer announces new hoax.
[1:57:14.840 --> 1:57:21.840]  Chuck E. Schumer says Trump may be a Chinese agent.
[1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:25.840]  Well yeah I mean he might be a moon bat from Pluto.
[1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:32.840]  I mean he might be a Lucky Charms elf or this is not an elf that's a Lucky Charms guy's a leprechaun.
[1:57:32.840 --> 1:57:34.840]  He might be a Lucky Charms leprechaun.
[1:57:34.840 --> 1:57:36.840]  I mean it just never ends.
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:40.840]  And I think about how we've all been vindicated on the Russiagate thing.
[1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:45.840]  When do these people get in trouble for being a pack of lion criminals?
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:55.840]  This time of year I'm always promoting Winter Sun our high quality organic vitamin D3 vitamin K combo.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:04.840]  Because it's in the fall it's in the winter it's in the spring that people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs.
[1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:12.840]  And then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are reaching havoc out there.
[1:58:12.840 --> 1:58:17.840]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live not just to defend against these viruses.
[1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:24.840]  So right now we have Winter Sun still available even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall winter and spring.
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:30.840]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23.
[1:58:30.840 --> 1:58:38.840]  Despite the fact that I could sell it at full price because I want you to get it and I want to incentivize you protecting yourself and your family.
[1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:47.840]  So Winter Sun taken out of the tongue super high quality 40% off available now at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:56.840]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air.
[1:58:56.840 --> 1:59:06.840]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you but I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:13.840]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:22.840]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there the air filtration the water filtration the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[1:59:22.840 --> 1:59:28.840]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:59:28.840 --> 1:59:32.840]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars.
[1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:43.840]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[1:59:43.840 --> 1:59:49.840]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:59:49.840 --> 1:59:57.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:00.840]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:00:00.840 --> 2:00:09.840]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:00:09.840 --> 2:00:11.840]  All right Dr. Steve Pachennick's coming on.
[2:00:11.840 --> 2:00:15.840]  I wanted to get him on about Malton.
[2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:24.840]  Now this weird video of him supposedly in the Middle East but Chuck Schumer just had a press conference about 45 minutes ago.
[2:00:24.840 --> 2:00:28.840]  And he was just up there saying Trump could be working for these people.
[2:00:28.840 --> 2:00:30.840]  He could be working for those people.
[2:00:30.840 --> 2:00:32.840]  We don't know when he talks to world leaders.
[2:00:32.840 --> 2:00:35.840]  So remember when he would meet with Putin in public and he'd shake his hand.
[2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:37.840]  He shook his hand.
[2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:39.840]  It's a proof he's a Russian agent.
[2:00:39.840 --> 2:00:41.840]  He can't meet alone with the Russians.
[2:00:41.840 --> 2:00:44.840]  I mean they'll see the big board.
[2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:49.840]  Like it's Dr. Strange Love meanwhile Obama's on tape saying hey as soon as I win re-election I can do a lot more.
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:51.840]  Be sure and tell Vladimir.
[2:00:51.840 --> 2:00:53.840]  I will tell Vladimir.
[2:00:53.840 --> 2:00:55.840]  So this is how they're trying to paralyze everything.
[2:00:55.840 --> 2:00:59.840]  Well now they're just saying the president can't even operate as the presidency.
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:03.840]  The bureaucracy is just saying he talks to anybody it's treason.
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:06.840]  And so this is what Schumer was just saying.
[2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:17.840]  Now it seems like every day some new revelation emphasizes our request for relevant witnesses and documents in this trial and gives it momentum.
[2:01:17.840 --> 2:01:22.840]  There's been a steady drip drip drip of information.
[2:01:22.840 --> 2:01:26.840]  The truth leaking out in one explosive article after another.
[2:01:26.840 --> 2:01:30.840]  In that sense this is reminiscent of Watergate.
[2:01:30.840 --> 2:01:41.840]  Emails were released over the Christmas break showing that the delay on military assistance was placed 91 minutes after the president's July 25th call with President Zelensky.
[2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:50.840]  Emails from Michael Duffy revealed that he had quote clear direction from the president to continue the hold on military assistance.
[2:01:50.840 --> 2:02:00.840]  And yesterday the New York Times reported on several stunning chapters from Ambassador Bolton's book including the admission by Mr.
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:13.840]  Bolton that he was ordered by the president to continue freezing military assistance to Ukraine until it was announced the political investor until it announced the political investigations he was seeking.
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:20.840]  The details from Ambassador Bolton get to the very heart of the first article of impeachment.
[2:02:20.840 --> 2:02:25.840]  The same New York Times story places Mick Mulvaney at the center of this plot.
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:29.840]  He's a more important witness probably than Bolton.
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:38.840]  And the emails from Duffy and Blair the two other witnesses we seek are even more relevant as this information comes out.
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:47.840]  So I understand why Leader McConnell and President Trump wanted a very short incredibly rushed trial.
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:57.840]  Because the longer it goes on the more likely that new evidence and more new evidence will come out that further implicates the president.
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:03.840]  Now just look at the other New York Times report last night about Ambassador Bolton's book.
[2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:10.840]  Several members of the administration had concerns about the president's dealings with autocrats.
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:14.840]  Particularly Xi of China and Erdogan of Turkey.
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:24.840]  Did the president have financial interest at stake when he was talking to Erdogan, Orban, Xi and others.
[2:03:24.840 --> 2:03:28.840]  Maybe his kids had some economic interest at stake.
[2:03:28.840 --> 2:03:33.840]  And did it impact our nation's foreign policy with those countries?
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:38.840]  Those questions are not the subject of the president's impeachment trial.
[2:03:38.840 --> 2:03:44.840]  But this report should be a warning sign to any Republican in the Senate.
[2:03:44.840 --> 2:03:55.840]  If you vote with the White House to suppress and cover up evidence, the odds are strong that the truth, the truth, will eventually come out.
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:06.840]  In a few weeks or a few months, do my Republican colleagues want to pick up the paper and read that one of the witnesses they blocked had crucial information about the president's misconduct?
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:14.840]  That the documents they voted to hide turned out to shed real damning light on the truth?
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:23.840]  At this point, how can Senate Republicans not vote for the witnesses and documents we are seeking?
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:28.840]  Well, Bolton famously, you know, making up the WMDs for the New York Times, now he's back doing it again.
[2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:32.840]  But you heard him. My gosh, the president talking to anybody is treason.
[2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:36.840]  He's just not allowed to. And who knows what could be going on.
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:41.840]  This from the very same leftists that have sold this country out of the Chikoms and others.
[2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:50.840]  Everything they've done, like Dianne Feinstein, basically a Chikom officer, is now what they're blaming Trump and our military and the American people with.
[2:04:50.840 --> 2:04:53.840]  These people are unbelievable.
[2:05:20.840 --> 2:05:33.840]  Now we're bringing you an all new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.
[2:05:33.840 --> 2:05:39.840]  Ultra 12 from Info Wars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available,
[2:05:39.840 --> 2:05:50.840]  Methicobolamine, to provide you with twice the B12. Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[2:05:50.840 --> 2:06:13.840]  For your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Ultra 12.
[2:06:13.840 --> 2:06:23.840]  Well, the political establishment in this country that's allied with the Chikoms and the globalist model.
[2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:34.840]  Really thinks the American people are ignorant about basic systems and they're betting all of their chips on that because now they're openly trying to cripple the presidency.
[2:06:34.840 --> 2:06:44.840]  They're trying to absorb a branch of government for the bureaucracy and say the president can't talk to the Turkish leader. He can't talk to Xi Jinping.
[2:06:44.840 --> 2:06:49.840]  The left's usually worshipping the communist Chinese leadership.
[2:06:49.840 --> 2:06:55.840]  But now Trump, if you just joined us, will play the clip coming up again, a short piece of it, might be a Chikon agent.
[2:06:55.840 --> 2:06:59.840]  We just don't know. We've got to have this trial go on forever.
[2:06:59.840 --> 2:07:07.840]  Steve Puchenikon, because he knows Ambassador Bolton and is aware of their neocon ways and warned Trump at the time.
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:11.840]  I remember he was on a couple of years ago. He was like, what the hell are you doing, Trump, bringing Bolton in?
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:15.840]  We exposed Fiona Hill, all of them, Soros and globalist operatives.
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:21.840]  Now there's video on infoworks.com with John Bolton reportedly seen wandering around, cutter.
[2:07:21.840 --> 2:07:22.840]  But here's the thing.
[2:07:22.840 --> 2:07:29.840]  Politico says, oh, he is there, says his spokesperson on personal business.
[2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:33.840]  So it probably is him. What is he doing walking around?
[2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:35.840]  What kind of weirdness is he involved in?
[2:07:35.840 --> 2:07:42.840]  I know Steve Puchenik was here a month ago and he said, listen, you better not make up something about the president and engage in this deception.
[2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:44.840]  Be good for you to go overseas and hang out.
[2:07:44.840 --> 2:07:46.840]  Maybe he's telling the weather's nice over there.
[2:07:46.840 --> 2:07:53.840]  But Dr. Steve Puchenik's joins us, co-wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy, ran a lot of different black ops operations out of the State Department and other agencies.
[2:07:53.840 --> 2:07:56.840]  Doesn't need any introduction. Steve Puchenik.com.
[2:07:56.840 --> 2:07:57.840]  Thanks for joining us.
[2:07:57.840 --> 2:08:10.840]  Wow, what a crazy time to be here watching the media and the Democrats say that if the president tells people what color place match to have in the dining room, that it's somehow an abuse of power.
[2:08:10.840 --> 2:08:13.840]  What the hell's going on here?
[2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:16.840]  What you see is what I've said a long time ago.
[2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:20.840]  It's pretty much the death knell, not for the president.
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:27.840]  It is for Congress. It is for the Senate. It is for our Congresspeople.
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:38.840]  The reason for that is what they're showing you is that through a series of processes, they came up to a reality that had no correspondence to what really happened.
[2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:42.840]  The president of the United States can do whatever he wants.
[2:08:42.840 --> 2:08:48.840]  If the worst thing he did is he's delayed the export of weapons.
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:49.840]  Big deal.
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:09:01.840]  We had a Bolton who was in charge of creating a war in Iraq, Afghanistan, along with Cheney and Bush, and Schiff was behind this and Schumer.
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:07.840]  And they all supported war in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Yemen where thousands are dying.
[2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:09.840]  It becomes a farce.
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:26.840]  As I've said before, Bolton has been known for three administrations to be a pathological liar, a pathological powered, a man who will send us to war, but at the same time will refuse to service in war as he did in Vietnam or Iraq.
[2:09:26.840 --> 2:09:31.840]  Now, if the administration can't handle that, that's sad.
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:40.840]  I said a long time ago, Trump has to be a lot tougher than he is and was. He couldn't allow the neo-cons to come in.
[2:09:40.840 --> 2:09:44.840]  At the same time, Bolton should have been arrested for a lot of things.
[2:09:44.840 --> 2:09:58.840]  Number one, when you put out that kind of information on a public book, which he received 2.4 million, I can assure you I could never have published that book under even a Clancy franchise.
[2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:09.840]  And the reason for that is it should have been cleared by the National Security Agency and all the Intelligence Agency, and that is an issue which was not done.
[2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:16.840]  In other words, whatever he wrote in the commercial book was not allowed to be present.
[2:10:16.840 --> 2:10:34.840]  So the normal screening process in law was not followed, but a lot of world leaders are afraid to talk to Trump now because it's paralyzing that they can't even talk candidly or tell him classified stuff because the Democrat operatives are all there writing down fake twisted notes and then use the secrecy to leak disinformation, then they don't get in trouble.
[2:10:34.840 --> 2:10:44.840]  And so it's basically a total penetration of national security and no such thing as any form of privacy that a normal family would enjoy inside their own house.
[2:10:44.840 --> 2:10:47.840]  Now the Oval Office is literally a giant fishbowl.
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:49.840]  Well, let's put it this way.
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:58.840]  Number one, Trump keeps counsel to himself and to Ivanka and Dr. Eric Kushner, and for the most part, one or two other people.
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:00.840]  I'm not sure that.
[2:11:00.840 --> 2:11:08.840]  No, no, I agree, but I'm saying the Democrats would like to put out that idea that you can't deal with Trump so that confidence is lost in him and America.
[2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:29.840]  Well, that's fine, they can put out whatever they want, but President Xi appreciated what Trump had said about transparency in China about the fact that Xi had done an appropriate seclusion of different areas and he tied off Hulan and Hubei because of the flu epidemic.
[2:11:29.840 --> 2:11:40.840]  More importantly, Erdogan will not change his attitude to Trump because he received $6 billion. President Xi will not turn his attitude away from Trump.
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:43.840]  Putin is laughing his way into the Kremlin.
[2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:45.840]  He thinks this is a joke.
[2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:56.840]  What's really happening at this particular point is the absurdity of our representatives and how little they really do in a time of need.
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:06.840]  Right now we have a world epidemic. Is it going to affect America? Maybe yes, maybe no. Has there been a Surgeon General appointed? I haven't seen any.
[2:12:06.840 --> 2:12:21.840]  Has Public Health Service officers been appointed? I haven't seen any. Has Schumer ever said anything about any national security issue other than what they think is a national security issue, which is really not a national security issue?
[2:12:21.840 --> 2:12:33.840]  They can't sell off America anymore to the highest bidder. I totally agree. So them making total fools of themselves, as even mainline polls show, they don't seem to get it. What's wrong with Schiff and Pelosi and Schumer?
[2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:36.840]  They don't get what clowns they are?
[2:12:36.840 --> 2:12:52.840]  No, they literally think in their world they have achieved the apex of success. In other words, remember what they really do. They just sit there and they talk to one another and create committees upon committees.
[2:12:52.840 --> 2:13:04.840]  And they decided that for this one final time they're going to impeach a president, whatever that really means. And they thought Nixon was the model for this. They're wrong.
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:12.840]  Number two, there is no national security problem we had with Ukraine or even what Trump has done.
[2:13:12.840 --> 2:13:21.840]  Number three, they're becoming so irrelevant that they really cannot admit the fact that there is no position anymore for you, Schumer.
[2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:35.840]  You're not relevant in a world where we're doing quantum encryptions. We're working at a rate that's algorithmic and you are not relevant. Neither is any one of your representatives.
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:47.840]  Pelosi is finished. The mob is finished. The Italian and Jewish influence and Congress is finished. We're on to another type of reality. And that reality is called business.
[2:13:47.840 --> 2:14:02.840]  The business of foreign policy is what Trump understands and he will continue to make deals with China, which he has phase one. He will go into phase two and then eventually I predict he will make a deal with North Korea.
[2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:12.840]  So now what you see is Trump keeps going on despite all the impediments, which by the way is really feeding Trump's need to achieve more.
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:26.840]  What they don't understand and they're not very smart when it comes to the dynamics of Trump is that the more you come up against him, the more he will do to achieve success for other people.
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:35.840]  So the trials and tribulations of putting together a hotel in New York City took him eight years, but he did it. He put it on there.
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:46.840]  He did Wilma Memorial when Koch couldn't do anything. So the more you fight against him as a Democrat, you really self-destruct and that's what's happening to Schumer.
[2:14:46.840 --> 2:14:58.840]  Because Trump would have taken them into the table. Trump would have taken them in and let them have a seat in all this, but now they've made themselves enemies.
[2:14:58.840 --> 2:15:06.840]  The point that's coming out, Alex, is what you said. They're not relevant. He doesn't need them at the table. He doesn't need them for anything.
[2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:16.840]  He doesn't need them from the approval of a treaty. He doesn't need them for him to say to the publishers of Bolton's book, you violated national security.
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:22.840]  Here are the issues we're going to sue you and there's no relevance to the veracity.
[2:15:22.840 --> 2:15:37.840]  So what's happening is the presidency becomes more important in a way that's interesting, not in a way that we've known in the past, with the Mitt Romney's who were ineffectual, with the Obama's who were ineffectual and came out of the CIA,
[2:15:37.840 --> 2:15:46.840]  or the Bolton's who worked for Cheney and Bush. What's coming out is the very nature of America, which is entrepreneurial.
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:53.840]  We've got to go to break. Let's come back. Let's come back in just a few minutes to talk about what's going to happen to Bolton. Stay with us.
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:33.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:33.840 --> 2:16:40.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.
[2:16:40.840 --> 2:16:53.840]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[2:17:10.840 --> 2:17:17.840]  If anything is wrong, hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:21.840]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:28.840]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:17:28.840 --> 2:17:36.840]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:18:05.840]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks. You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters.
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:11.840]  You want them off your back and off your children's back and you know what, I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[2:18:11.840 --> 2:18:26.840]  It's why Info Wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity and I know you are as well.
[2:18:26.840 --> 2:18:34.840]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[2:18:34.840 --> 2:18:43.840]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family and from the great crew at Info Wars, I want to thank you all because you are the Info War and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:55.840]  You have made history. We have made history together. InfoWars.com only has power because of you and I suggest you use it.
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:12.840]  This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here giving you a sales pitch. I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:20.840]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic.
[2:19:20.840 --> 2:19:30.840]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride is the bad halogen and people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[2:19:30.840 --> 2:19:39.840]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:53.840]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at InfoWars.com and I'm telling you folks, get it. It's amazing. Discover the benefits and it funds the Info War, a 360 win. You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[2:20:09.840 --> 2:20:29.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:29.840 --> 2:20:42.840]  All right, Dr. Steve Pechenick, a really smart guy is our guest and he's the consummate individual that's seen things from so many different angles. He's been a medical doctor, psychiatrist, run psych wards, been in the military and in secret operations, regime change.
[2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:48.840]  Kent David Accordes, I mean you name it, he's seen a hell of a lot of stuff. That's why he was the main source guy for Tom Clancy.
[2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:54.840]  Everybody's like, who's this guy? He's getting all this from. Well it's Dr. Steve Pechenick and we really appreciate him coming on the show.
[2:20:54.840 --> 2:21:03.840]  And he's been very visionary about things. He'd come on the show 18, 19 years ago, I guess early 2002, February 2002 when he first came on and said, Ben Lawton's really dead.
[2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:12.840]  They're going to roll his dead body out later. He's on ice. And he'd been in the CFR and been this big monkey, but he resigned out of it saying, you're obsolete.
[2:21:12.840 --> 2:21:22.840]  Everything's going to move out of the east and west coast. It's going to move to the center of the country in the south and we're going to have to innovate and the EU is going to fall and the whole New World Order is going to go down.
[2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:33.840]  And I'm like, wow, this guy's really too optimistic. I said maybe 20, 30 years from now. But no, he's been saying that about 15 years and it's really happening.
[2:21:33.840 --> 2:21:39.840]  So when he puts a good face on it, still got a lot of problems with incompetence and things and laziness and corruption.
[2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:46.840]  But yeah, Hollywood is falling apart. They're America hating. They don't get it. The most popular stuff out there is people saying how much they hate Hollywood.
[2:21:46.840 --> 2:21:59.840]  But Hollywood's still arrogant. So are the Crypt Keeper Pelosi and Schumer and they just don't quit. Now they're saying the president might be a Chinese agent when they're the ones up with their eyeballs in Chai Con money.
[2:21:59.840 --> 2:22:07.840]  It's just insane. So let's get more into this. You are a psychiatrist. You don't want to violate the Goldwater rule and diagnose them from afar.
[2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:17.840]  But I think just in general diagnosing their group psychology mob psychology kind of Hitler in the bunker delusionalism. What would you call this?
[2:22:17.840 --> 2:22:29.840]  What it is, it's predictable. It's called what Jerry Post wanted to say and Dr. Lee wanted to say about Trump that he had malignant narcissism.
[2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:53.840]  In fact, it is Schumer Pelosi and the Democrats who have a very serious problem of narcissism, meaning that their sense of self worth is so inflated that they don't realize they're really entering into the self destruction of their own of their own position and their own party.
[2:22:53.840 --> 2:23:03.840]  And it's a wonderful thing to see because Trump just increased the velocity at which these people will basically fall apart.
[2:23:03.840 --> 2:23:14.840]  He will get reelected. There's no question about it. And every American who's watching this show is going to say, you know what, they've wasted my time and money.
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:26.840]  In the meantime, there was a flu epidemic going around the world. Nothing was said. In the meantime, Trump has made a deal with China and the economy is still roaring up.
[2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:34.840]  So what do you have? Correct. We can say there's self delusion, but there's so much self delusion because they have nothing else to do.
[2:23:34.840 --> 2:23:45.840]  Nancy Pelosi is basically what we call an idiot savant. We had to teach her on this show that we are a republic, not a democracy.
[2:23:45.840 --> 2:23:52.840]  So she went back and read all about the Republic Schumer is an idiot savant because he has nothing else to do.
[2:23:52.840 --> 2:24:04.840]  They went to the best schools. They wanted to be the best positioned people in the world and they are nobody. They're not really relevant to our treaties. They haven't served our country.
[2:24:04.840 --> 2:24:16.840]  And so what they're seeing is the death knell. They hear it and they have nothing else to do but scream, yell, reach out, grab whatever they have like children and hold on to it.
[2:24:16.840 --> 2:24:21.840]  And then eventually they will die a very quiet death.
[2:24:21.840 --> 2:24:31.840]  And I ask you your next prediction because you've been dead on so far as frighteningly so. So look at Dr. Stephen Cheney, Crystal Ball.
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:38.840]  When I go out in the streets, I probably shake 200 hands before somebody drives by and says F. U. Russian spy or something like that.
[2:24:38.840 --> 2:24:45.840]  But now I go out in huge crowds and really no one anymore says F. U. Russian spy or F. U. This or that.
[2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:58.840]  Leftists kind of have their mouths open and don't know what to do. So I see a collapse in the piranha like hatred of their minions and their useful idiots just on the streets of America out there with the people.
[2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:02.840]  And a real confidence in America and even a poll show.
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:12.840]  Racial division is at all time lows. Everything they tried. It's happening the opposite effect people. It seems the knowledge of the street is accelerating and people are getting it.
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:20.840]  And again, I see their own foot soldiers absolutely now not knowing what to do and wanting to join us quite frankly.
[2:25:20.840 --> 2:25:30.840]  Well, you hit it on the head without being, you know, vein glorious. You had been very modest, but thanks to you and the alternative media which ironic is the alternative media.
[2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:42.840]  And I've said this 17 years ago is going to maintain media because when you see the New York Times, they're going to talk to you about the very simple nuances of the words of the impea.
[2:25:42.840 --> 2:25:52.840]  Nobody reads that nonsense. When you see Hollywood, nobody's watching the Oscars. Nobody watched the Golden Globes. Nobody gives a damn about the grannies.
[2:25:52.840 --> 2:26:01.840]  That's antiquated with Schumer with Pelosi. Anything from California, including the state itself is not relevant.
[2:26:01.840 --> 2:26:10.840]  They're losing 340 people a day into areas like Florida, Texas, Carolinas, where we don't have any taxes.
[2:26:10.840 --> 2:26:18.840]  So they're like somebody in 1920 that owns a horse buggy factory and is confident that the automobile is just a fad is going to go away.
[2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:23.840]  They are still betting on the horse and they think that their time is just now coming.
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:30.840]  Well, you hit it on the head. It's not only they're betting on the horse. They're riding the horse. They're feeding the horse.
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:37.840]  And then what they're doing and they don't even understand is they're beating the horse. Now you hit it on the head.
[2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:45.840]  They're beating their own horse so that eventually they're falling and the horse is dying and they try to do this with our country.
[2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:48.840]  But fortunately, people listen to you.
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:53.840]  By the way, I don't mean to be grandizing towards you, but I thought of that and knew you'd finish the metaphor.
[2:26:53.840 --> 2:26:55.840]  We didn't set that up. That was cool right there.
[2:26:55.840 --> 2:26:59.840]  We didn't. We think alike, but honestly.
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:05.840]  What we're doing is talking about what they're doing. That's why I mean that's what they're doing is how long can they beat the dead horse?
[2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:15.840]  They as long as they have the next few months and then at the end you will see that they are finished.
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:22.840]  And then people like Mitt Romney, who are draft Dodgers and religious hypocrites makes the Mormon church look terrible.
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:25.840]  And he's a Mormon elder and he's disgusting.
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:37.840]  He's Bain Associates, a corrupt institution, went to MIT, which I'm now ashamed of as a school and there he is saying, oh, I think we should have witnesses.
[2:27:37.840 --> 2:27:39.840]  Who the heck are you Romney?
[2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:46.840]  You're the most corrupt, ineffectual, cowardly American I've known on the level where you were governor of Massachusetts.
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:48.840]  You ran to Utah.
[2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:52.840]  You're such a prostitute of the Mormon church.
[2:27:52.840 --> 2:27:55.840]  It's disgusting. Even the Mormon church doesn't want you.
[2:27:55.840 --> 2:28:02.840]  And I have respect for the Mormon church because they develop people like Brent Scowcroft and John Huntsman.
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:10.840]  And he has to compete against Huntsman who's worth far more billions than he is and was our ambassador to China and Russia.
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:16.840]  Mitt Romney is nothing as his wife said to me in response to what you and I said he was a draft Dodger.
[2:28:16.840 --> 2:28:22.840]  She said, oh, no, he had a very hard mission in Paris as a preacher.
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:31.840]  Really, during the Vietnam War, he was exposed to all of the French appoutrements while we were, you know, in combat.
[2:28:31.840 --> 2:28:36.840]  And red wine will be right back then getting your next predictions for what's going to happen in this trial.
[2:28:36.840 --> 2:28:37.840]  What you think Trump's doing good.
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:42.840]  What you think Trump is doing bad as there's no doubt the White House listens to info wars and doctors.
[2:28:42.840 --> 2:28:48.840]  Steve Bachanik of Steve Bachanik dot com. Now, please don't forget listeners that when you tell people about the show,
[2:28:48.840 --> 2:28:53.840]  the live feeds, the local radio stations, however you're listening, when you spread the word, it isn't just helpful.
[2:28:53.840 --> 2:28:54.840]  It's absolutely credible.
[2:28:54.840 --> 2:28:58.840]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:00.840]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:02.840]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:02.840 --> 2:29:08.840]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:13.840]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:21.840]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:28.840]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:33.840]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:38.840]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean.
[2:29:38.840 --> 2:29:40.840]  Call now and learn more.
[2:29:40.840 --> 2:29:44.840]  800-506-6740.
[2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:48.840]  800-506-6740.
[2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:54.840]  That's 800-506-6740.
[2:29:54.840 --> 2:30:04.840]  This time of year, I'm always promoting Winter Sun, our high quality, organic vitamin D3, vitamin K combo.
[2:30:04.840 --> 2:30:13.840]  Because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring, that people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs.
[2:30:13.840 --> 2:30:21.840]  And then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there.
[2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:26.840]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses.
[2:30:26.840 --> 2:30:33.840]  So right now, we have Winter Sun still available, even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter and spring.
[2:30:33.840 --> 2:30:42.840]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23, despite the fact that I could sell it at full price.
[2:30:42.840 --> 2:30:47.840]  Because I want you to get it and I want to incentivize you, protecting yourself and your family.
[2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:54.840]  So Winter Sun, taken under the tongue, super high quality, 40% off, available now at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:54.840 --> 2:30:58.840]  We've got three big sales going right now.
[2:30:58.840 --> 2:31:00.840]  And one of them has to end within a week.
[2:31:00.840 --> 2:31:06.840]  And that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.
[2:31:06.840 --> 2:31:08.840]  It's amazing, go check it out for yourself.
[2:31:08.840 --> 2:31:17.840]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best selling deep earth crystals iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[2:31:17.840 --> 2:31:19.840]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[2:31:19.840 --> 2:31:24.840]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[2:31:24.840 --> 2:31:29.840]  So just check it out for yourself, 40% off, infowarstore.com and it funds the M4.
[2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:36.840]  And then vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together, super high quality, Winter Sun.
[2:31:36.840 --> 2:31:40.840]  You don't have Sunder in the winter, Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[2:31:40.840 --> 2:31:42.840]  That's why people get so sick.
[2:31:42.840 --> 2:31:43.840]  That's the main reason.
[2:31:43.840 --> 2:31:46.840]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption, it's amazing.
[2:31:46.840 --> 2:31:51.840]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:51.840 --> 2:31:53.840]  Protect yourself and fund the M4.
[2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:55.840]  360 win.
[2:31:55.840 --> 2:32:00.840]  We now know that more than 60 million people are on total lockdown in China.
[2:32:00.840 --> 2:32:03.840]  And the food supplies and medical supplies are running out.
[2:32:03.840 --> 2:32:06.840]  The virus has already spread to more than a dozen countries.
[2:32:06.840 --> 2:32:12.840]  And many Chinese who escaped Wuhan are now confirmed to be arriving on the United States West Coast.
[2:32:12.840 --> 2:32:19.840]  We've now confirmed from major food suppliers across the United States that they've already run out of supplies of affordable foods
[2:32:19.840 --> 2:32:21.840]  because of institutional and governmental buyers.
[2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:27.840]  That's right, the rich, the powerful, the elite, big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[2:32:27.840 --> 2:32:32.840]  Info wars, private labels from my patriot supply, and ships right out of the very same factory.
[2:32:32.840 --> 2:32:38.840]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, but that's going to run out probably in a few weeks.
[2:32:38.840 --> 2:32:43.840]  And that people need to order now, they want to be able to get it within seven to 10 days.
[2:32:43.840 --> 2:32:46.840]  But if people wait, it may end up being longer.
[2:32:46.840 --> 2:33:05.840]  But if you get your order in now at infowarstore.com, you will be secured to get the food within seven to 10 days.
[2:33:16.840 --> 2:33:21.840]  Info wars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[2:33:21.840 --> 2:33:25.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:35.840 --> 2:33:38.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am not an opportunist.
[2:33:38.840 --> 2:33:40.840]  I'm a trendsetter.
[2:33:40.840 --> 2:33:47.840]  My goal is to promote the lifestyle and freedom and things that I think are great up against the tyranny that the globalist promote,
[2:33:47.840 --> 2:33:57.840]  because I believe you're going to want to buy in to having a free, open, truly constitutional, renaissance based system,
[2:33:57.840 --> 2:34:07.840]  or the American system versus the chai comm system or the EU return of modern nobility models or all those old systems we rejected.
[2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:10.840]  And so that's what info wars promotes.
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:18.840]  Notice for the last few months, I'm saying, hey, our great vitamin D3 is known in all these big studies to really be antiviral and very strong
[2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:21.840]  and the equivalent of getting sunlight in the winter.
[2:34:21.840 --> 2:34:24.840]  It's getting sun that helps boost your immunity.
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:27.840]  And it's people that have the deficiencies that are open to the stuff.
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:31.840]  And again, knock on wood, I haven't had a fever in over four years.
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:36.840]  And it's because I take fish oil every day that also has some of the best sources of natural vitamin D3.
[2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:43.840]  So yes, we still have our vitamin D3 with vitamin K, 33% off, even though it's very close to selling out.
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:45.840]  I'm going to keep it there till it sells out.
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:52.840]  But the good news is we do have quite a bit still it's going to sell out to of ultimate fish oil,
[2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:56.840]  three different types of high quality fish oil, krill, which is technically isn't fish.
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:01.840]  And of course, the wild salmon and the anchovies, they're all in there.
[2:35:01.840 --> 2:35:03.840]  It's excellent.
[2:35:03.840 --> 2:35:06.840]  And this really is the best highest quality fish oil you could find.
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:11.840]  It's also put through the process of having any mercury that's there naturally removed.
[2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:13.840]  That's why this is high end fish oil.
[2:35:13.840 --> 2:35:15.840]  It's discounted in FullWareStore.com.
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:19.840]  So if you're worried about the flu and you're worried about this stuff, notice we're promoting this all the time.
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:22.840]  Before all this broke out, I'm saying, you need this for viral outbreaks.
[2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:24.840]  I hardly ever get sick.
[2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:28.840]  I'm not like opportunistically now saying, hey, you need to get this because of the outbreak in China.
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:32.840]  We're selling a hell of it because people know I've been promoting it and getting it.
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:33.840]  That's trend setting.
[2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:36.840]  And it's not much trend setting to know that fish oil is good for you.
[2:35:36.840 --> 2:35:39.840]  I can be in a bad mood, exhausted, hard to work at 18 hours.
[2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:42.840]  I got to do some overnight radio show.
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:45.840]  Used to I'd drink a half bottle of wine and drink four cups of coffee.
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:46.840]  That doesn't work for me.
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:52.840]  Big old, juicy fish oil.
[2:35:52.840 --> 2:35:55.840]  So good to wake me up and it makes you sleep better.
[2:35:55.840 --> 2:35:57.840]  So stuff that does for your body is really amazing.
[2:35:57.840 --> 2:36:02.840]  Infowarstore.com and it also does something magic, it funds this operation.
[2:36:02.840 --> 2:36:05.840]  So if I was you and you've been on the fence about fish oil or vitamin D3,
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:09.840]  I think now's the time to start taking it because in the winter you're not getting sun.
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:11.840]  And that's why a lot of people are so sickly.
[2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:13.840]  Well, this is the natural way to get it without the sun.
[2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:14.840]  Infowarstore.com.
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:18.840]  Going back to Dr. Steve Pacinic of StevePacinic.com.
[2:36:18.840 --> 2:36:21.840]  You've got the floor of the next, this segment, what we have left in the next segment,
[2:36:21.840 --> 2:36:24.840]  looking into the crystal ball, other angles you want to cover.
[2:36:24.840 --> 2:36:27.840]  But first, Bolton. You knew he'd be their star witness,
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:29.840]  months ago and again a month ago.
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:31.840]  You said, hey, you ought to get out of the country.
[2:36:31.840 --> 2:36:33.840]  I think that was a threat, just a friendly thing.
[2:36:33.840 --> 2:36:36.840]  Whatever you meant by it, now there's this video looks like him,
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:38.840]  political reports, he is actually in cutter.
[2:36:38.840 --> 2:36:43.840]  What do you make of that and what Bolton supposedly is going to be testifying to
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:46.840]  as this star witness and how is the guy known for lying about WMDs
[2:36:46.840 --> 2:36:49.840]  with the Office of Special Plans and all these other groups?
[2:36:49.840 --> 2:36:53.840]  What is this known liar, again, teamed up with his old cohorts,
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:55.840]  his old conspirators at the New York Times.
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:36:59.840]  How does this known certified liar have any credibility?
[2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:04.840]  He has none. The real issue here, Alex, as you know very well.
[2:37:04.840 --> 2:37:08.840]  Number one, when I came on the show and I warned him, you're not going to testify,
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:12.840]  I got all kinds of problems from upstairs in my intelligence community,
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:15.840]  but I was telling them, you know, cool it.
[2:37:15.840 --> 2:37:21.840]  Number one, Bolton will eventually be found to be a liar and a pathological liar
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:25.840]  and corrupt. The key issue here is not Bolton, my friend.
[2:37:25.840 --> 2:37:28.840]  It's what I said all along about Trump.
[2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:34.840]  Either he's going to order William Barr to force Simon and Schuster,
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:37.840]  which is a corrupt publishing company.
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:41.840]  I was with them. They're incompetent. They're losing money.
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:47.840]  It's going to force Simon and Schuster, cease and desist the publication of that book,
[2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:52.840]  return the 2.4 million, or they will be brought into court.
[2:37:52.840 --> 2:37:56.840]  Right now, I have not seen William Barr do one thing,
[2:37:56.840 --> 2:38:00.840]  one arrest on the Epstein case, an arrest on Bolton,
[2:38:00.840 --> 2:38:07.840]  an arrest on any of the neocons who've been involved, and Barr is compromised.
[2:38:07.840 --> 2:38:12.840]  I'm saying now, if William Barr cannot act as a proper attorney general,
[2:38:12.840 --> 2:38:18.840]  where he knows for a fact, and I know for a fact because I'm in the publishing business,
[2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:22.840]  Simon and Schuster is out of their mainstream legal fund.
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:27.840]  In other words, this is totally inappropriate for Simon and Schuster
[2:38:27.840 --> 2:38:31.840]  to have gotten this information, to have been cleared through the intelligence community,
[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:34.840]  to have been cleared through the National Security Agency,
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:39.840]  and he cannot arrest Bolton and Simon and Schuster, the head of it.
[2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:44.840]  Barr should resign. As I said before, he never did anything in the Epstein case.
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:48.840]  I've said before, he's highly compromised, worked with George Bush,
[2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:52.840]  and this man, Barr, who thinks he's so smart,
[2:38:52.840 --> 2:38:59.840]  it was his father who hired Epstein for the Dalton Day School for the women,
[2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:04.840]  and he was the one who converted, no offense, from Judaism to Catholicism.
[2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:08.840]  Now he sees Jesus. Well, that's good for him, but he better see the writing
[2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:13.840]  on the wall from people like me who are saying you're incompetent,
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:18.840]  you haven't done your job, and if you can't do it, get the hell out of the office
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:24.840]  and stay away because you are now on notice that you did nothing with Epstein.
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:32.840]  You made up the most nonsensical stories about a man killing himself in the cell by himself.
[2:39:32.840 --> 2:39:38.840]  Secondly, Pompeo is getting hit. I got to give him credit for having hit the NPR lady
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:43.840]  and said this was inappropriate. So that means that Trump has to back up Pompeo.
[2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:48.840]  He has to get rid of the attorney general, and he's got to start cutting down
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:52.840]  on the number of people in the State Department, in the White House,
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:55.840]  in the intelligence community. I haven't seen it.
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:40:00.840]  I haven't seen anything since the last time we talked that he's any tougher,
[2:40:00.840 --> 2:40:05.840]  any firmer with his ideas about what has to happen in the United States.
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:10.840]  And secondly, we have a coronavirus coming in.
[2:40:10.840 --> 2:40:13.840]  For the most part, we will be safe. I can guarantee that.
[2:40:13.840 --> 2:40:18.840]  The reason I can guarantee is because I treated a patient a month ago,
[2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:23.840]  it was really the first case of the coronavirus before it was ever reported,
[2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:27.840]  of a gentleman who met with a Chinese individual and got the pneumonia
[2:40:27.840 --> 2:40:30.840]  and was treated with high doses of antibiotics.
[2:40:30.840 --> 2:40:36.840]  And I am to know this individual very well because that individual happens to be me.
[2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:39.840]  And I was the first case to have it in the United States.
[2:40:39.840 --> 2:40:43.840]  And now I'm saying to the Public Health Service and the Attorney General,
[2:40:43.840 --> 2:40:47.840]  get your act together. It's not coming outside of China.
[2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:54.840]  You already have Chinese students in every major university who have been contaminated
[2:40:54.840 --> 2:40:57.840]  and you haven't gone through the major universities.
[2:40:57.840 --> 2:41:02.840]  Harvard, Princeton, Gainesville University, Florida, Florida State University,
[2:41:02.840 --> 2:41:07.840]  they all have Chinese students who have been infected or have some matter of...
[2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:11.840]  Well, I was about to say, I mean, I have no doubt that a lot of weird pneumonia comes out of there
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:13.840]  and you may have gotten that and I'm sure you're right.
[2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:16.840]  I mean, you are a doctor. What I'm saying is obviously there's a lot more of it going on
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:18.840]  than we even know about that. Get into what happened to you.
[2:41:18.840 --> 2:41:22.840]  Because I know you were sick a while back. What happened?
[2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:25.840]  Well, what happened is a month and a half ago...
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:27.840]  I don't remember because you were on and looked good and then you came on.
[2:41:27.840 --> 2:41:31.840]  I said there in the break, not to you. I said, man, he looks like he almost died
[2:41:31.840 --> 2:41:34.840]  and your head was shaved. I mean, you look better now, but what the hell happened?
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:39.840]  What happened is I got the pneumonia and it turned out to be a week and a half
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:45.840]  after I met a Chinese student who came out of Gainesville and didn't speak English too well,
[2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:50.840]  came from the Wuhan area. There was no notice of the coronavirus,
[2:41:50.840 --> 2:41:53.840]  but fortunately I'm a pretty good doctor. I'm a board examiner.
[2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:56.840]  So I did what I normally do. You don't get an x-ray.
[2:41:56.840 --> 2:42:00.840]  I don't get a sputum because most doctors are not clinically a droid.
[2:42:00.840 --> 2:42:05.840]  So I did and took a lot of antibiotics, about 3,000 milligrams of it,
[2:42:05.840 --> 2:42:11.840]  took me a week and a half, a lot of fluids, rest, bed rest, and then I'm fine.
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:14.840]  But right now we're not going to have an epidemic.
[2:42:14.840 --> 2:42:20.840]  The United States is fine, but instead of looking outside, I would suggest
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:26.840]  that we get a public health service surgeon general who will look at the different universities
[2:42:26.840 --> 2:42:28.840]  and look right now at what we have.
[2:42:28.840 --> 2:42:30.840]  Well, hold on. I want to hear more about this because I remember when you were super sick
[2:42:30.840 --> 2:42:32.840]  and couldn't come on him on the dab. When you came back on, I was like,
[2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:36.840]  wow, he really looks like he's been sick and then you said, yeah, I've been sick,
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:39.840]  but I'm okay now. Now you look better. And I want to talk about that idea.
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:44.840]  Trump shouldn't create a panic, but I agree. He should have a surgeon general by now
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:46.840]  and they should say, we're looking at this.
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:50.840]  And so if something is really bad, then they don't look like they were caught flat-footed.
[2:42:50.840 --> 2:42:52.840]  Well, they're right back. Stay with us.
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:57.840]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from InfoWars.
[2:42:57.840 --> 2:43:02.840]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:06.840]  to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold,
[2:43:06.840 --> 2:43:10.840]  not just here in the U.S. but worldwide. And President Trump's fearlessness
[2:43:10.840 --> 2:43:15.840]  when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[2:43:15.840 --> 2:43:20.840]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:25.840]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:28.840]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever,
[2:43:28.840 --> 2:43:34.840]  we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[2:43:34.840 --> 2:43:39.840]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[2:43:39.840 --> 2:43:41.840]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[2:43:41.840 --> 2:43:47.840]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[2:43:47.840 --> 2:44:15.840]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:21.840]  We know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile a leader real.
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:25.840]  But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[2:44:25.840 --> 2:44:30.840]  But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[2:44:30.840 --> 2:44:33.840]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[2:44:33.840 --> 2:44:38.840]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:40.840]  and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:42.840]  So it's an incredible town to be alive.
[2:44:42.840 --> 2:44:45.840]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:52.840]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support at www.mploresport.com is critical.
[2:44:52.840 --> 2:45:21.840]  So please take action.
[2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:27.840]  It's the power of the elite. Big corporations are now buying up food stores at alarming rates.
[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:32.840]  In full wars, private labels from my patriot supply and ships right out of the very same factory.
[2:45:32.840 --> 2:45:38.840]  They called and let us know that they have bought food forward, that that's going to run out probably in a few weeks.
[2:45:38.840 --> 2:45:43.840]  And that people need to order now. They want to be able to get it within seven to ten days.
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:46.840]  But if people wait, it may end up being longer.
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:55.840]  If you get your order in now at www.mploresport.com, you will be secured to get the food within seven to ten days.
[2:45:55.840 --> 2:46:01.840]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:05.840]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[2:46:05.840 --> 2:46:10.840]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[2:46:10.840 --> 2:46:18.840]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[2:47:19.840 --> 2:47:23.840]  It was pretty amazing earlier, but he said hundreds of those things here on the show that turned out to be true.
[2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:29.840]  People were always like, this guy says he was in that operation, this operation, and that one, and you go look it up and he was.
[2:47:29.840 --> 2:47:32.840]  A lot of times the feds come after him when he says stuff on the show.
[2:47:32.840 --> 2:47:36.840]  Because I didn't know he was going to say that John Bolton stuff. He's been called in the federal court, you name it.
[2:47:36.840 --> 2:47:47.840]  But I know when he said, hey, maybe the first case, potentially yes, because I remember when he was really sick, he wouldn't say, say why a few months ago.
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:54.840]  But that's what I haven't seen this much pneumonia-like symptoms. I'm on a doctor like him.
[2:47:54.840 --> 2:48:05.840]  Since my uncle and my dad's great uncle and my cousin all lived on the same ranch, three houses up on the top of our ranch family hill, the old family place.
[2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:10.840]  There's three, actually four ranch houses, but they lived in three of them. They all got it. They all died in a couple weeks.
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:19.840]  And when I talked to the doctors there in East Texas, it was in Palestine, is the nearest big hospital about 30 miles away.
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:24.840]  They were like, yeah, Alex, this is a big cover-up of the CDC. It's some kind of really bad pneumonia virus.
[2:48:24.840 --> 2:48:29.840]  There's people dying all over the place. They were wheeling dead people out while I was there for the week my uncle died.
[2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:34.840]  And man, he got it, and he said he couldn't breathe, went to the hospital, and he was dead a week later.
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:38.840]  He was in a coma a day later. Very, very sad to watch that happen.
[2:48:38.840 --> 2:48:44.840]  I haven't heard so much of this and gotten so many calls from others around the country it's going on since then.
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:48.840]  That's why I've been on air before we even heard about the coronavirus the last few weeks saying something's going on.
[2:48:48.840 --> 2:48:53.840]  You better get your vitamin D3, you better get your sunshine, you better get your clean water, you better wash your hands,
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:58.840]  especially when you're around foreign students because we know that's where a lot of this stuff pours in.
[2:48:58.840 --> 2:49:06.840]  So I wanted to ask you, I mean, obviously, if they're saying it's a pandemic now, it's much worse than they've said.
[2:49:06.840 --> 2:49:13.840]  If you were sick a month and a half ago from this, it probably was the same thing or some similar type virus.
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:18.840]  Why does so much of it come out of China? I know that one time I interviewed you when you were in North Korea,
[2:49:18.840 --> 2:49:25.840]  I mean, you go all over the place, took photos and sent them to me from there. Why does so much stuff come out of China?
[2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:32.840]  It's a good question. Number one, let me assure your audience and the American audience, we're not pandemic.
[2:49:32.840 --> 2:49:37.840]  We have control of this. This will be controlled. I don't want everybody panicking.
[2:49:37.840 --> 2:49:45.840]  Number two, Alex knows this. I have supported him, but I also support what he says with regard to prevention.
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:52.840]  I think all that you're saying is correct. Take the vitamin D, take the fish oil, stay healthy,
[2:49:52.840 --> 2:50:02.840]  and you're less likely to get pneumonia because the key element of getting pneumonia or coronavirus is the immunity system.
[2:50:02.840 --> 2:50:10.840]  So as long as your immunity system, even if you're 60, 70s or you're young and you're in good shape, you take your vitamins,
[2:50:10.840 --> 2:50:16.840]  you work out, you stay healthy, that virus is not going to be lethal. So that's number one.
[2:50:16.840 --> 2:50:23.840]  Number two, the fact that we don't have a surgeon general and a public health service is disturbing.
[2:50:23.840 --> 2:50:28.840]  And let me get into what happened. Years ago, when we had the Ebola epidemic,
[2:50:28.840 --> 2:50:36.840]  I had to sit down with a former friend of mine and ask this individual who was the former assistant surgeon general of the United States,
[2:50:36.840 --> 2:50:43.840]  do we have a surgeon general? The answer was no. Do we have a public health service that can stop the Ebola from coming in?
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:55.840]  No. I said, will you have a problem if I order General Dempsey and others to send over 3,000 U.S. Army soldiers into Liberia and Sierra Leone?
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:51:03.840]  The answer was no. That's what we did. And I thank General Dempsey, who was chief of staff at the time,
[2:51:03.840 --> 2:51:11.840]  and our army and our military officers who created a situation where there was no Ebola really coming into the United States
[2:51:11.840 --> 2:51:15.840]  and they redeployed assets out of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[2:51:15.840 --> 2:51:20.840]  This time around, if we have to deploy the military and we don't have public health service,
[2:51:20.840 --> 2:51:27.840]  I suggest that President Trump sit down, evaluate what he's got, and understand what he has to do.
[2:51:27.840 --> 2:51:35.840]  There's a very talented individual who's the head of the National Institute of Infectious Disease and Allergies, Anthony Fauci.
[2:51:35.840 --> 2:51:41.840]  He was my resident. He's talented. He correctly said that we can break the genome,
[2:51:41.840 --> 2:51:48.840]  meaning we can have the code of that virus, but it will take us, he correctly said, a year to have a proper vaccine.
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:57.840]  We don't have that one year, but we do have antibiotics. And the reason why I'm proposing it is you're not going to see the pneumonia on an X-ray.
[2:51:57.840 --> 2:52:05.840]  You're not going to spew it out. It becomes what we call in medicine, I'm getting a little technical, primary, typical pneumonia.
[2:52:05.840 --> 2:52:11.840]  Because I've had it in the past and I've traveled all over the world, you don't often see it. Doctors miss it.
[2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:19.840]  And they say, no, we don't treat viruses with antibiotics. Well, it mutates very quickly and you can treat it with antibiotics.
[2:52:19.840 --> 2:52:27.840]  My point is simple. Do not panic. We have everything in control. Now, President Trump, get your act together.
[2:52:27.840 --> 2:52:38.840]  Assign somebody as a Surgeon General and create a public health service or appoint the Secretary of Defense, Esper,
[2:52:38.840 --> 2:52:49.840]  to mobilize military so that we have a convenient way to control what comes in and out of our country. And at the same time, without getting panicked,
[2:52:49.840 --> 2:53:00.840]  go to the various universities and assess how many Chinese or Oriental students we have, not to deport them just simply to know what's going on.
[2:53:00.840 --> 2:53:08.840]  And to assess them, can I throw this in? Because it's the right thing to do. It's the President's constitutional purview to protect the borders from plagues.
[2:53:08.840 --> 2:53:17.840]  That's even the Declaration of Independence that the British weren't letting us do that. And it also looks good for reaching out to China, offering them help.
[2:53:17.840 --> 2:53:26.840]  And at the same time, if there is a bigger problem here, then people know that Trump got ahead of it. If he doesn't, they're going to point out, hey, you didn't appoint a new Surgeon General.
[2:53:26.840 --> 2:53:31.840]  If you've been derelict, you know they're going to attack him on this and then try to derail the economy.
[2:53:31.840 --> 2:53:38.840]  I totally agree that this is something the President needs to get out ahead of, not to create a panic, but just to say, hey, just in case there's an issue,
[2:53:38.840 --> 2:53:44.840]  this is what we're doing and we're going to start screening everybody coming in. I mean, I was reading the news yesterday out of Hawaii.
[2:53:44.840 --> 2:53:50.840]  They're not even screening people at most airports flying in from China, from the mainland to Hawaii or to Seattle or to LA.
[2:53:50.840 --> 2:53:55.840]  That's insane. I'm not a medical doctor like you. That just sounds insane to me.
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:53:58.840]  It's a problem, but you hit the problem right on the head.
[2:53:58.840 --> 2:54:13.840]  And why it even makes the impeachment sound more bizarre is that Schumer Pelosi had no understanding, not an idea, an iota of how they're responsible for what's going on in terms of this epidemic,
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:24.840]  because they're wasting our time, attention and incredible amounts of money, which we should be putting into the health services, into the National Institute of Health, into the public health service.
[2:54:24.840 --> 2:54:35.840]  Like you said, it's not just the money. It's the focus. Everything is narcissistic, focusing on shift week after week, month after month, babbling the same garbage.
[2:54:35.840 --> 2:54:40.840]  I hear it and I tune out. No one's watching it. It's unwatchable.
[2:54:40.840 --> 2:54:48.840]  It's malignant narcissism. What Post and Lee wanted to say about Trump is what you have about these people, but let's not talk about them.
[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:55.840]  Let's go on to the other issues. You're correcting your approach to the audience. It is not a panic. It is not terrible.
[2:54:55.840 --> 2:55:09.840]  It can be dealt with very effectively. It's now time for Trump to appoint a surgeon general and to mobilize a public health service or mobilize DoD and let them act as a public health service officers.
[2:55:09.840 --> 2:55:15.840]  Other than that, there will be no panic. The markets are fine and we're not in the danger zone.
[2:55:15.840 --> 2:55:23.840]  I happen to have had it. There are others who will get it. They won't know exactly what it has to do, but it's very common.
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:29.840]  And now we have to talk about other matters. So let's talk about Bolton. Why is Bolton a problem?
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:38.840]  Because he's the epicenter of non-accountability. He has been a liar, deceitful, cowardly, went to Yale.
[2:55:38.840 --> 2:55:47.840]  We have William Barr, again, who has done nothing. I've had before him Mueller who did nothing. I had Comey who did nothing.
[2:55:47.840 --> 2:55:59.840]  So the Bolton's of the world underscore how corrupt, cowardly individuals who never want to serve our country, like the Mitt Romney's and others, get to a position of power.
[2:55:59.840 --> 2:56:04.840]  They can manipulate a president or they get themselves involved with the president.
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:13.840]  Do you think he's out of the country so that he can't be subpoenaed but can act like he wants to be and is just going to let the book cowardly stand for him so he can attack the president?
[2:56:13.840 --> 2:56:24.840]  It's not even relevant to me. I could care if Bolton were alive or dead because Bolton isn't the person himself that I'm interested in, is what he's represented over the years.
[2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:35.840]  You had Almay Halazzad, you had the Richard Pearls, you had the Wolfowitz, you had all these guys who are neocons and said we got to get a war and now nobody was held accountable.
[2:56:35.840 --> 2:56:44.840]  The Mueller's were never held accountable. The Comey's are not held accountable. The Barr's. So I don't care if Bolton flies into the stratosphere.
[2:56:44.840 --> 2:56:51.840]  He's not a relevant individual. It's what he represents. Are you going to indict Simon and Schistoff? That's what I want to know.
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:57:01.840]  I know when I had books, I had to clear it through my lawyers at Warner Books, at Berkeley Putnam. I was at Simon and Schistoff and I found it to be a disaster.
[2:57:01.840 --> 2:57:09.840]  And you sure as hell weren't talking about secret White House conversations. Dr. Pachennick, StevePachennick.com. Please come back on the war room today if you can.
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:16.840]  Owen's super sick. Or if you can't come back on my show or that tomorrow because I know you've got more to say. Paul Joseph Watson's about to take over from England.
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:23.840]  But again, StevePachennick.com has new books out there as well. So thank you so much. I look forward to speaking to you again soon and glad you got better.
[2:57:23.840 --> 2:57:29.840]  All right, thank you. All right, folks. Paul Watson's coming up. I've got five more minutes where I've got a few things to say.
[2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:35.840]  And then I'm going up in a helicopter in a little while to a live feed to show folks I was dangerous as they're saying.
[2:57:35.840 --> 2:57:46.840]  Then I'm going to be back in studio later. But powerful broadcast today. Great job, crew. Fourth hour coming up. Stay with us.
[2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:15.840]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[2:58:15.840 --> 2:58:31.840]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[2:58:31.840 --> 2:58:43.840]  They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God. And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[2:59:02.840 --> 2:59:11.840]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[2:59:11.840 --> 2:59:22.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[2:59:22.840 --> 2:59:36.840]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[2:59:36.840 --> 2:59:54.840]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:00:07.840 --> 3:00:23.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:23.840 --> 3:00:36.840]  OK, folks, this just broke. Things are really getting crazy. Tsunami warning issued for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands and Cuba after a magnitude 7.3 earthquake. That is a big one.
[3:00:36.840 --> 3:00:53.840]  The coast of Jamaica, Cuba, and Cayman Islands could face hazardous tsunami waves following a 7.3 to 7.6 earthquake in the Caribbean Sea warns the U.S. Geological Survey. That is just absolutely wild.
[3:00:53.840 --> 3:01:03.840]  The Ring of Fire is on fire more than usual, but that's not even in the Ring of Fire. That's in the Caribbean Sea right in the middle of it.
[3:01:03.840 --> 3:01:15.840]  2020 has unprecedented volcanic activity, tectonic activity. It's just crazy. Paul Joseph Watson is scheduled to be taking over here in about five minutes.
[3:01:15.840 --> 3:01:27.840]  Let me just say this now. We're seeing unprecedented orders for storable foods. I would have storable foods because 2020 is a very dangerous year. The bubble is so huge and could pop.
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:36.840]  I hope it doesn't, even though it's fraudulent. It's incredibly dangerous and it don't cause. Well, you don't need me to tell you what will happen if this giant bubble pops.
[3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:46.840]  And the globalists are trying to pop it to kill nationalism and hurt the liberty movement. You've got all the economic crises they're trying to create on top of this virus that's out.
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:57.840]  Then on top of that, you've got all the wars. The globalists are trying to stir up and start openly. You've got all the race war they're trying to start. You've got the 2020 election. It's an insane time.
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:04.840]  So I've been promoting storable foods to everybody because they're high quality. It's insurance you can eat. With all the inflation, it'll only be worth more later.
[3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:12.840]  It lasts 25 years. We go out and find the very best companies. They have the very best quality at the very lowest price. And that's my Patriot supply.
[3:02:12.840 --> 3:02:21.840]  And then so that I have my own private label of their full spectrum of food so I can sell it for less, we private label it as in full wars select.
[3:02:21.840 --> 3:02:30.840]  But it's their full catalog. Our stickers are thrown on their tubs of the product right there at their factory in Utah.
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:38.840]  And they are saying that they've never sold this much food. All the major competitors they know of are selling out because of institutional buyers.
[3:02:38.840 --> 3:02:50.840]  They're still able within 7 to 10 days to ship it to you. If you get your orders in on their small orders, their big orders, whatever the order size is you need, 7 to 10 days it will be shipped out to you.
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:58.840]  If you get your order in now, they don't know about me tomorrow the next day. They're not sure, but they're going to have to extend out and say, sorry, two weeks, three weeks.
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:06.840]  They're not sure. They've got temp laborers in. They've got their factories going 24 hours a day. They've got big warehouses of stockpile food.
[3:03:06.840 --> 3:03:13.840]  They're running through it current sales rates. That'll be gone in two weeks. They're trying to get more in, but they're one of the biggest outfits out there.
[3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:19.840]  And they're respected and they're who I use because the food is good. It tastes good. It's quality.
[3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:25.840]  You can pay five times more and find some gourmet stuff that's even better. But there's an excess point for how much it costs versus the quality.
[3:03:25.840 --> 3:03:32.840]  And this is right in the middle, X marks to a spot. And they're patriots that have been supporting us for more than 10 years since they started.
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:40.840]  And they started small and are now in the top three because of the quality and the fact that when they tell you something's being sent to you, you get it.
[3:03:40.840 --> 3:03:46.840]  So many of these companies will take your order and then they hold it because they don't have the food when there's a run on food like this.
[3:03:46.840 --> 3:03:52.840]  My patriot doesn't do it. Again, I used to promote a big water filter company for over 10 years. They had great quality.
[3:03:52.840 --> 3:03:58.840]  They were wonderful. They were the top name and gravity fed filters when their quality went down and when their deliveries weren't good anymore,
[3:03:58.840 --> 3:04:10.840]  dropped them like an old shoe, didn't have a gravity fed filter sponsor for two years because I couldn't find one that was as good a high level quality that did what they said they do.
[3:04:10.840 --> 3:04:18.840]  Then my patriot supply went out and the same people developed the Alexa Pure Breeze and all the third party studies highest rating.
[3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:29.840]  There's also, of course, the Pro Pure system as well. They're excellent right out there as well. We sell both those 33% off infowarstore.com.
[3:04:29.840 --> 3:04:38.840]  I'm lowering prices on the D3 and other things during this crisis, not jacking them up, but just as sure as the sun came up, it's all selling out right now.
[3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:47.840]  So get your orders in for high quality swarable foods right now for all the reasons out there and it's insurance you can eat and it funds the info war, a total 360 win.
[3:04:47.840 --> 3:04:52.840]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over in T minus 60 seconds.
[3:05:17.840 --> 3:05:31.840]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas. Now we're bringing you an all new version of your favorite formula to help you reach your energy peak.
[3:05:31.840 --> 3:05:47.840]  Ultra 12 from Info Wars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, Methicobolamin, to provide you with twice the B12. Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[3:05:47.840 --> 3:06:02.840]  Help support your energy levels and take advantage of the superior form of B12 today with Ultra 12.
[3:06:02.840 --> 3:06:18.840]  And we are live as the coronavirus continues to spread.
[3:06:18.840 --> 3:06:35.840]  100 people have now died the infections have searched more than 4500 that we know of, because you can trust the communist Chinese government to tell you the truth. In every single scenario, they didn't lie about the SARS outbreak for months and months did they so you can trust them.
[3:06:35.840 --> 3:06:48.840]  So it continues to spread. More deaths, more infections, closing down of borders, but you know what's more concerning about a potential coronavirus pandemic that could kill tens of thousands of people.
[3:06:48.840 --> 3:07:03.840]  What's more concerning than that, what's more worrying, what's more fearful is racist bat memes. Yes, it took the mainstream media, it took the progressive media a good three or four days to pick up on this and they are usually quite slow.
[3:07:03.840 --> 3:07:15.840]  But finally, they're now starting to react to the trolling. The most concerning thing about the coronavirus outbreak is not the potential mass death.
[3:07:15.840 --> 3:07:31.840]  But the racist means we have a story. And by the way, in that trolling with basically cornered progressive media outlets into defending this that you're seeing on your screen right now into defending people munching on bats.
[3:07:31.840 --> 3:07:42.840]  We have to understand when we talk about bat soup, they haven't stripped the meat off and carefully prepared it and cooked it, which would be disgusting, because bats are known vectors for diseases.
[3:07:42.840 --> 3:07:54.840]  Bats were to blame for the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Bats were to blame for the SARS outbreak in China. That's what it was traced back to. We've not only forced them into a corner to defend that.
[3:07:54.840 --> 3:08:09.840]  Oh, and by the way, Chinese people also eat bat poop. They think it cures eye disease. As I pointed out in my video from a few days ago, a good way of avoiding disease is probably not to eat literal crap.
[3:08:09.840 --> 3:08:20.840]  Probably not the best idea. I'm not a doctor, but I will feel confident in giving out that advice. Of course, Chinese people also eat 10 to 20 million dogs every single year.
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:33.840]  According to the progressive media, we need to accept that. The main concern here is racism, despite the fact that Chinese is not a race. People eat disgusting stuff in countries all over the world.
[3:08:33.840 --> 3:08:44.840]  Chinese is not a race. Of course, we've seen the videos worse than the bat soup videos. I've seen videos of the past few days. In fact, I've lost my appetite completely since Thursday.
[3:08:44.840 --> 3:08:55.840]  I've seen videos of people in China just walking into reptile pet shops, scooping out reptiles from tubs and just biting their heads off.
[3:08:55.840 --> 3:09:03.840]  And if you oppose that, you're bigoted, you're closed-minded, you're racist. We have a headline here out of foreign policy.
[3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:23.840]  There you see exactly what I'm talking about right there. Just literally scoops it out, bites its head off, rips its organs out. There's a video of frog sashimi, I think it's called, where literally they just pull out the frogs intestines while it's still alive, let it sit in a bowl and then eat it while it's still alive.
[3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:37.840]  We've seen videos of people eating live baby mice, dipping them in sauce while they're still wriggling around fully alive and shoving them in their mouths. That's progressive if you oppose that, you're bigoted, closed-minded and racist.
[3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:46.840]  We have a headline here out of foreign policy. It says, don't blame bat soup for the Wuhan virus. Because again, racist memes are more of a concern.
[3:09:46.840 --> 3:09:57.840]  Racist memes target Chinese eating habits, but the real causes of the coronavirus are Mormon Dane. It says, as news of the Wuhan virus spread online, one video became emblematic of its claimed origin.
[3:09:57.840 --> 3:10:05.840]  It showed a young Chinese woman supposedly in Wuhan, biting into a virtually whole bat, nom nom nom, as she held the creature up with chopsticks.
[3:10:05.840 --> 3:10:17.840]  Media outlets from Daily Mail to RT promoted the video, as did a number of prominent extremist bloggers, such as Paul Joseph Watson. Their source for me being an extremist is Facebook.
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:23.840]  So if Mark Zuckerberg says you're an extremist, that's it. Judge, jury and executioner, you're an extremist.
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:34.840]  Twitter users blame supposedly dirty Chinese eating habits, in particular the consumption of wildlife for the outbreak, said to have begun at so-called wet market that sold animals in Wuhan, China.
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:38.840]  There's just one problem. The video wasn't set in Wuhan at all.
[3:10:38.840 --> 3:10:48.840]  Now they're claiming that this video that started the bat soup meme was the video out of Halao, I think it's pronounced, don't know about the exact pronunciation.
[3:10:48.840 --> 3:11:02.840]  The Pacific Island Nation, which showed a host of a travel show eating a bat, she later had to apologize on orders of the Chinese government for eating this bat on this travel show three years ago.
[3:11:02.840 --> 3:11:10.840]  That's completely incorrect. The video that started the bat soup meme is the one you just played right there. It's a different woman.
[3:11:10.840 --> 3:11:18.840]  Apparently, according to foreign policy, which is very concerned about racist memes, they think all Chinese people look the same because they've got the wrong video.
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:25.840]  That video that you're seeing right now is what started the bat soup meme, not the one of the travel host apologizing.
[3:11:25.840 --> 3:11:32.840]  That video was popularized on Twitter a couple of days later, so that's immediately factually incorrect.
[3:11:32.840 --> 3:11:41.840]  It continues, sampling the bat was simply an addition to the well trodden canon of enthusiasm for unusual foods.
[3:11:41.840 --> 3:11:50.840]  Yes, you should salivate with enthusiasm as you're chomping down into the wing of a bat that's barely being cooked and just plonked on a plate.
[3:11:50.840 --> 3:12:03.840]  It's a corpse. Let me strip the meat off. That's disgusting. That's gross. No matter what race, nationality of person is eating it and in no matter in what country, it's gross.
[3:12:03.840 --> 3:12:10.840]  That's an objective fact. Again, the reason they're doing this is they're all moral relativists. They're all cultural relativists.
[3:12:10.840 --> 3:12:18.840]  If they can justify anything, they can justify any evil. No, you have to have standards. You have to have judgment. Some cultures are better than others.
[3:12:18.840 --> 3:12:29.840]  The article continues, at a time of height and fear over a viral pandemic, the plough video has been deployed in the United States deployed like some kind of warfare technique.
[3:12:29.840 --> 3:12:39.840]  No, people were laughing at it because it was funny and disgusting in the United States and Europe to renew an old narrative about supposedly disgusting eating habits of foreigners, especially Asians.
[3:12:39.840 --> 3:12:57.840]  Images of Chinese people or other Asians eating insect snakes or mice. Yes, that's disgusting. Scooping up baby mice with chopsticks, dipping them in sauce while they're wriggling around and alive and shoving them in your mouth and chomping down.
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:09.840]  That's disgusting. No matter who's doing it, don't eat food that's still alive. Can we at least agree on the basic premise not to eat mammals that are still alive?
[3:13:09.840 --> 3:13:21.840]  It says this time there was another old racist idea that the dirty Chinese are carries of disease. Well, SARS broke out because of bats being sold at these very same illegal food markets.
[3:13:21.840 --> 3:13:31.840]  That's the fact. There's many Americans long believed that as New York Daily Tribune wrote in 1854, Chinese people were uncivilized unclean filthy beyond all conception.
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:42.840]  Well, some some cultures in some countries have better sanitary conditions than others. That's also a fact. A lot of Indian people poop in the streets.
[3:13:42.840 --> 3:13:54.840]  The UN literally has to launch multimillion dollar campaigns to tell Indian people to not crap in the streets because children were getting malnutrition from the diseases that that cause.
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:13:58.840]  That's not a racist trope. That's a fact.
[3:13:58.840 --> 3:14:12.840]  Today, those same ideas that often mean transfer to other groups such as South American refugees, yet they still persist in the way some Westerners think about China. These prejudices could fuel fear and racism.
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:15.840]  So it goes on and on and towards the middle of this article.
[3:14:15.840 --> 3:14:26.840]  It says, as it turns out, after making an entire argument that bats who are this meat from exotic wild animals sold in these markets, which have now been shut down.
[3:14:26.840 --> 3:14:36.840]  The premise is that that's not true and it has nothing to do with the coronavirus outbreak. It says, as it turns out, the market may not have been the cause of the outbreak at all.
[3:14:36.840 --> 3:14:39.840]  Really, really headline.
[3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:55.840]  The deadly coronavirus outbreak did start at the wild animal meat market in Wuhan, where snakes, rats, beavers, foxes, wolf cubs and peacocks are caged and slaughtered to order tests on firm. The deadly Chinese coronavirus outbreak began at a wholesale animal market in Wuhan City.
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:15:07.840]  Experts have confirmed scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention to test proof humans caught it from animals at the Hunan Seafood Wholesales Market in Wuhan.
[3:15:07.840 --> 3:15:13.840]  So they don't know exactly what mammal or reptile or whatever the hell they were eating there caused it.
[3:15:13.840 --> 3:15:26.840]  But we do know that the SARS outbreak began from bats. Bats are vectors for disease. Bats cause the Ebola outbreak in Africa where people eat fruit bats.
[3:15:26.840 --> 3:15:42.840]  What people are saying is Chinese people eat some pretty dodgy stuff. They literally kill and eat 20 million dogs a year. They dump bat corpses in soup. They eat bat poop. They eat live baby mice. They eat live frogs with their intestines splayed out.
[3:15:42.840 --> 3:15:52.840]  That's not healthy. That's dangerous. It's gross. It's disgusting. And to point that out is not racist. Don't go away. We'll be back.
[3:15:52.840 --> 3:16:01.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:01.840 --> 3:16:08.840]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too.

[3:16:21.840 --> 3:16:30.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:40.840]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[3:16:40.840 --> 3:16:51.840]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.

[3:18:52.840 --> 3:19:06.840]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half. And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got to get up there and tell people.
[3:19:06.840 --> 3:19:30.840]  So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[3:19:30.840 --> 3:19:44.840]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[3:20:00.840 --> 3:20:13.840]  You're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:13.840 --> 3:20:25.840]  Now I don't want to take the point here, but we have literally trolled the media into defending people who pick up live baby mice who are wriggling around and shrieking dipping them in sauce and chomping down on them.
[3:20:25.840 --> 3:20:36.840]  You've literally done that which is hilarious. But there's another article here. UK schools want to watch out for xenophobia as Corona virus spreads.
[3:20:36.840 --> 3:20:53.840]  Again, this is the UK boarding schools association. So they've got a lot of people in enclosed spaces in classrooms in schools. Many of them Chinese some of them presumably who have traveled to China for the Chinese New Year and are now going to be coming back into the UK and other countries.
[3:20:53.840 --> 3:21:08.840]  Are they concerned about potential victims of the Corona virus being infected and being in these enclosed spaces within classrooms. Are they warning the students to take precautions over that maybe where face masks maybe wash their hands, maybe not eat bat soup.
[3:21:08.840 --> 3:21:27.840]  They're telling them not to be xenophobic because it's worse to be dead than to be called racist. The UK boarding schools association is more concerned about mean words on the Internet than the outbreak of the Corona virus warning students that any expressions of xenophobia against Chinese people will not be tolerated.
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:41.840]  Despite the fact there have been no such recorded instances of xenophobia by the association to issue new instruction that its members should be watchful for prejudice against Chinese pupils by others via online or in person.
[3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:49.840]  They're saying stay alert for any signs of xenophobia even though there have been no instances of that.
[3:21:49.840 --> 3:21:59.840]  Chris Menahan comments what does it say about the West that our authorities appear to be more concerned with stopping the spread of xenophobia than stopping the spread of a global pandemic which could kill millions.
[3:21:59.840 --> 3:22:12.840]  Again thank God courageous school authorities have their finger on the pulse they're not too concerned about people potentially coming back from China potentially being infected within closed spaces they're more concerned about mean words on the Internet.
[3:22:12.840 --> 3:22:23.840]  In fact one of the blue check mark brigade on Twitter tweeted had a few people tell me how the Corona virus is due to people eating whole bats in soup.
[3:22:23.840 --> 3:22:30.840]  For one thing not true well kind of is true because it came out of that meat market where they sell bats and snakes.
[3:22:30.840 --> 3:22:43.840]  Second thing get used to the idea that people eat different stuff to you and as you can see on screen there somebody has posted an image of what some Chinese people eat.
[3:22:43.840 --> 3:22:57.840]  And that includes 20 million slaughtered dogs who are tortured who are kept in cages who are tied up in mesh bundles at these meat markets which are now finally being shut down by the government.
[3:22:57.840 --> 3:23:04.840]  So this is what the blue check mark brigade on Twitter are telling you to get used to. No I don't think we should get used to that.
[3:23:04.840 --> 3:23:09.840]  People talk about foie gras in the West and stuff like that.
[3:23:09.840 --> 3:23:23.840]  You'll in dog meat festival. I think that's on a different level so no we do exercise judgment we don't engage in cultural relativism and some food stuffs are definitely better than others.
[3:23:23.840 --> 3:23:36.840]  And of course the main concern is racist bat memes amidst you know 100 people dead was it now 5000 people infected but those racist bat memes man got to shut them down.
[3:23:36.840 --> 3:23:39.840]  Meanwhile, look about shutting things down.
[3:23:39.840 --> 3:23:45.840]  This is a headline out of Fox News Silicon Valley scrambles to stop Corona virus misinformation.
[3:23:45.840 --> 3:23:54.840]  They basically set the premise that everything coming out about the Corona virus from official sources must be true and can't be questioned.
[3:23:54.840 --> 3:23:59.840]  Despite the fact that China literally lies about its own GDP.
[3:23:59.840 --> 3:24:01.840]  But they never lie about this.
[3:24:01.840 --> 3:24:12.840]  The Corona virus has rapid spread worldwide is forcing big tech to confront the equally viral proliferation of misinformation in the form of outright falsehoods and half truths about the outbreak.
[3:24:12.840 --> 3:24:28.840]  So it's Facebook, Google and Twitter of all struggle in different ways to contain medical misinformation, in particular around vaccines in recent years that goes on to say how they're vigorously shutting down information about the Corona virus outbreak because we can trust.
[3:24:28.840 --> 3:24:32.840]  Chinese Communist Party overlords to tell us the truth.
[3:24:32.840 --> 3:24:34.840]  Even though.
[3:24:34.840 --> 3:24:42.840]  As this zero hedge article outlines they've lied about the quarantine procedures out of Wuhan.
[3:24:42.840 --> 3:24:48.840]  We've been hearing now for the best part of a week that Wuhan is in complete lockdown in complete quarantine.
[3:24:48.840 --> 3:24:56.840]  And specifically that they shut down the transport the rail network the buses that they've shut down the airport.
[3:24:56.840 --> 3:25:05.840]  Turns out that's not true. Zero hedge headline hundreds of virus carrying planes headed for US London Paris Vancouver.
[3:25:05.840 --> 3:25:07.840]  And it goes through a list.
[3:25:07.840 --> 3:25:13.840]  And in fact I've got up here the departure flights leaving Wuhan International Airport.
[3:25:13.840 --> 3:25:19.840]  And there's literally pages and pages of flights leaving that airport.
[3:25:19.840 --> 3:25:26.840]  They have not shut down the airport. There are flights going most of them granted within China Shanghai Beijing etc.
[3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:31.840]  Of course then those individuals are just going to get on flights from Shanghai Beijing.
[3:25:31.840 --> 3:25:35.840]  Flying to London flying to San Francisco flying to LA.
[3:25:35.840 --> 3:25:37.840]  They've got flights going to Bangkok.
[3:25:37.840 --> 3:25:40.840]  This airport has not been shut down.
[3:25:40.840 --> 3:25:43.840]  Article states there's no lockdown in China.
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:44.840]  If you're wealthy.
[3:25:44.840 --> 3:25:50.840]  Check out this Beijing flight schedule for today. Here's the Wuhan flight schedule for today.
[3:25:50.840 --> 3:25:55.840]  Beijing departures 25 flights on a single page.
[3:25:55.840 --> 3:25:57.840]  How easy is it to escape Wuhan?
[3:25:57.840 --> 3:26:07.840]  You can still catch a flight from Wuhan to Anchorage Tokyo Seoul Bangkok Singapore Taipei and countless cities in China including Beijing and Shanghai.
[3:26:07.840 --> 3:26:09.840]  Wuhan departures tomorrow.
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:16.840]  Tomorrow there are four flights from Wuhan Singapore 3 to Taipei 2 to Bangkok 3 to Tokyo 3 to Paris.
[3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:23.840]  Which I believe has already had an outbreak or suspected at least 6 to Hong Kong and 3 to San Francisco.
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:26.840]  So those flights have not been shut down.
[3:26:26.840 --> 3:26:32.840]  We look at what happened with the SARS epidemic back in 2002.
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:41.840]  And it says the viral outbreak was genetically traced to a colony of cave dwelling horseshoe bats in China's Yunnan province.
[3:26:41.840 --> 3:26:49.840]  The media says it's a conspiracy theory that there's any link between bats and virus outbreaks.
[3:26:49.840 --> 3:26:54.840]  So as the SARS epidemic started in Guangdong province.
[3:26:54.840 --> 3:26:59.840]  China in November 2002 where the first case was reported that same month.
[3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:02.840]  The patient died soon after it goes on to talk about that.
[3:27:02.840 --> 3:27:05.840]  But then it talks about how despite taking some action to control it.
[3:27:05.840 --> 3:27:13.840]  Chinese government officials did not inform the World Health Organization of the outbreak until February 2003.
[3:27:13.840 --> 3:27:19.840]  So it took them three months to even inform the WHO that there was a SARS outbreak in China.
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:21.840]  Oh but you can trust them on everything else.
[3:27:21.840 --> 3:27:27.840]  This lack of openness caused delays in efforts to control the epidemic.
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:30.840]  And it goes on to talk about spreading to other regions.
[3:27:30.840 --> 3:27:33.840]  It goes on to talk about the origin of the SARS outbreak.
[3:27:33.840 --> 3:27:43.840]  The phylogenetic analysis of these viruses indicated a high probability that SARS coronavirus originated in bats.
[3:27:43.840 --> 3:27:49.840]  And spread to humans either directly or through animals held in Chinese markets.
[3:27:49.840 --> 3:27:54.840]  These very same markets that have now been finally shut down by the government.
[3:27:54.840 --> 3:28:07.840]  Meanwhile, vice, Vox, foreign policy are all saying that it's a racist conspiracy theory to even dare suggest that the coronavirus in 2020 has any link to bats.
[3:28:07.840 --> 3:28:11.840]  Daily Mail reports coronavirus alert in Birmingham, England.
[3:28:11.840 --> 3:28:19.840]  As medics in hazmat suits quarantine suspected victim after he was sent home by GP despite revealing he had just returned from Wuhan.
[3:28:19.840 --> 3:28:27.840]  And in fact, they're saying that in these pictures there are other medical professionals not even wearing any protection whatsoever.
[3:28:27.840 --> 3:28:31.840]  The picture shows one individual wearing a hazmat suit.
[3:28:31.840 --> 3:28:42.840]  But again, I guess hazmat suits are racist right now because you can't even suggest that this could be related to bats in any way imaginable.
[3:28:42.840 --> 3:28:50.840]  That is a racist conspiracy theory. Anyone who puts that out is being xenophobic and that's more concerning than a potential global pandemic.
[3:28:50.840 --> 3:29:13.840]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops.
[3:29:13.840 --> 3:29:23.840]  This is one of the symptoms of people's lives across America.
[3:29:23.840 --> 3:29:52.840]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[3:30:36.840 --> 3:30:40.840]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3. That's why people get so sick.
[3:30:40.840 --> 3:30:41.840]  That's the main reason.
[3:30:41.840 --> 3:30:45.840]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue at higher absorption. It's amazing.

[3:31:19.840 --> 3:31:25.840]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[3:31:25.840 --> 3:31:28.840]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[3:31:28.840 --> 3:31:37.840]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago is sort of taking true iodine, atomic iodine.

[3:32:15.840 --> 3:32:25.840]  Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[3:32:25.840 --> 3:32:35.840]  Anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[3:32:35.840 --> 3:32:50.840]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[3:32:50.840 --> 3:33:06.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:06.840 --> 3:33:14.840]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:14.840 --> 3:33:20.840]  And I'm going to talk about Stephen King. He got canceled by the woke witch trying to generals last week.
[3:33:20.840 --> 3:33:25.840]  He's desperately trying to prostrate himself to get back in there. Good graces. We'll talk about that.
[3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:28.840]  But now I'm going to play a segment from a video which just went up.
[3:33:28.840 --> 3:33:35.840]  You can watch the full video at Summit.News about why Western women have stopped having babies.
[3:33:35.840 --> 3:33:50.840]  Here's the clip right now and come back. Here it is.
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:34:16.840]  For women who want kids, the sooner, the better. 90% of eggs gone by age 30.
[3:34:16.840 --> 3:34:25.840]  It's common knowledge that women have more difficulty conceiving as they age, but this is the very first study believed to quantify the number of eggs lost.
[3:34:25.840 --> 3:34:29.840]  And it shows that the decline is more rapid than previously believed.
[3:34:29.840 --> 3:34:34.840]  In Britain, the percentage of childless women has doubled in a generation.
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:42.840]  And for the first time more than half, 54% of American women aged 25 to 29 are childless.
[3:34:42.840 --> 3:34:46.840]  Nearly a third, 31% of women aged 30 to 34.
[3:34:46.840 --> 3:34:47.840]  Hey, oh, egg check.
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:48.840]  No eggs.
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:52.840]  Americans in an egg shortage crisis you may not even have known about.
[3:34:52.840 --> 3:34:54.840]  If only you knew how bad things really are.
[3:34:54.840 --> 3:35:01.840]  1,200 childless American women aged 25 to 45 were asked why they were delaying childbirth.
[3:35:01.840 --> 3:35:03.840]  They were allowed to pick more than one answer.
[3:35:03.840 --> 3:35:05.840]  What was the top answer?
[3:35:05.840 --> 3:35:07.840]  I want to focus on my career.
[3:35:07.840 --> 3:35:08.840]  No.
[3:35:08.840 --> 3:35:13.840]  A more popular answer than that was, quote, I want to have life experience.
[3:35:13.840 --> 3:35:21.840]  And almost as popular as the career answer was the answer that they, quote, value freedom and don't want to be tied down.
[3:35:21.840 --> 3:35:24.840]  There's a party in my pussy.
[3:35:24.840 --> 3:35:28.840]  Something way is going on.
[3:35:28.840 --> 3:35:29.840]  Big doubt.
[3:35:29.840 --> 3:35:37.840]  Sex and the Sissy writer Candice Bushnell, 60, admits she regrets choosing a career over having children as she is now truly alone.
[3:35:37.840 --> 3:35:38.840]  Freedom.
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:43.840]  What happens when you socially engineer women to get out of the home and into the boardroom,
[3:35:43.840 --> 3:35:47.840]  to get out of nurturing children and into chasing pointless college degrees,
[3:35:47.840 --> 3:35:50.840]  to get out of stable monogamous relationships,
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:57.840]  and into the toxic hellscape of hypergamous dating and extracting beta books from simps on social media.
[3:35:57.840 --> 3:35:58.840]  What happens?
[3:35:58.840 --> 3:35:59.840]  No eggs.
[3:35:59.840 --> 3:36:00.840]  No eggs.
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:02.840]  You don't have any eggs.
[3:36:02.840 --> 3:36:03.840]  No eggs.
[3:36:03.840 --> 3:36:04.840]  No eggs.
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:05.840]  No eggs.
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:06.840]  No eggs.
[3:36:06.840 --> 3:36:07.840]  I'mante Kerk.
[3:36:07.840 --> 3:36:09.840]  You don't have any eggs.
[3:36:10.840 --> 3:36:20.840]  The hypersexualisation of our abortion on demand culture is brainwashing girls to swap life-affirming monogamy for rampant promiscuity.
[3:36:20.840 --> 3:36:24.840]  The number of STDs in America has reached a record high.
[3:36:24.840 --> 3:36:30.840]  With 2.4 million reported cases of Chlamydia Gonarinaensophilus in 2018,
[3:36:30.840 --> 3:36:33.840]  in David Cronenberg's 1975 movie Shivers,
[3:36:33.840 --> 3:36:39.800]  movie shivers. A mad scientist creates a parasite that makes the residents of a high-rise residential
[3:36:39.800 --> 3:36:45.960]  tower act like sex-craved carnal animals. The motive of the scientist was to use a combination
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:52.960]  of aphrodisiac and venereal disease to turn the world into one huge mindless orgy. And
[3:36:52.960 --> 3:36:59.920]  in our world, the entertainment industry is that parasite. Our culture is that one huge
[3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:00.920]  mindless orgy.
[3:37:00.920 --> 3:37:02.920]  I'm munching on red pills all day.
[3:37:02.920 --> 3:37:09.160]  Have you ever noticed how these same entertainment and media corporations that harp on about
[3:37:09.160 --> 3:37:16.600]  respecting women and opposing objectification and misogyny literally groom underage female
[3:37:16.600 --> 3:37:22.720]  celebrities into superstar status, then begin salivating about the prospect of sexualizing
[3:37:22.720 --> 3:37:27.920]  them right before they're about to turn 18, then relentlessly exploit them for the next
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:34.560]  20 years by hypersexualizing everything they do for the consumption of teenage girls. What
[3:37:34.560 --> 3:37:40.120]  message does that send? What role models do teenage girls have who aren't scantily clad
[3:37:40.120 --> 3:37:46.360]  hoes working around to canned pop songs written by computer algorithms owned by Sony, UMG
[3:37:46.360 --> 3:37:51.680]  and Warner? Billy Eilish says she may want to show her body and look desirable in a music
[3:37:51.680 --> 3:37:56.560]  video after she turns 18. The bad guy singer said in a new interview that she wanted the
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:38:02.240]  option to show her body when she turned 18, an about face from her previous statement
[3:38:02.240 --> 3:38:07.600]  saying she purposefully wore baggy and oversized clothes to hide her body from would be body
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:12.720]  shamers. Gee, I wonder what male corporate executive at the biggest music company in
[3:38:12.720 --> 3:38:17.680]  the world convinced her to do that. Have you ever noticed how corporations relentlessly
[3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:22.920]  virtue signal about how much they respect whamming about how it's imperative to get
[3:38:22.920 --> 3:38:27.880]  more women in the boardroom and how it's crucial to help women overcome objectification by
[3:38:27.880 --> 3:38:32.840]  adopting affirmative action policies that help them obtain powerful positions in society
[3:38:32.840 --> 3:38:39.400]  while simultaneously engineering society and building platforms that encourage the exact
[3:38:39.400 --> 3:38:45.000]  opposite platforms that incentivize women to behave like thoughts whose only value comes
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:54.080]  from being objectified by men. What is Instagram? It's a virtual red light district for women
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:38:59.360]  to parade themselves, lewd and half naked for the approval of thirsty dudes. What is
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:05.320]  TikTok? It's a platform marketed to teenagers which incentivizes underage girls to act like
[3:39:05.320 --> 3:39:10.400]  burlesque dancers in strip clubs. For the viewing pleasure of sex crazed teenage boys
[3:39:10.400 --> 3:39:29.760]  and literal pedos. Which in turn incentivizes the girls watching to mimic that behavior
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:53.920]  and chase the same dopamine hype. What is only fans? What is premium snapchat? Virtual
[3:39:53.920 --> 3:39:59.720]  prostitution meat markets where men pay women to sexually degrade themselves. E-prostitution
[3:39:59.720 --> 3:40:05.720]  is killing traditional courtship and romance. If women behave like prostitutes online men
[3:40:05.720 --> 3:40:11.040]  are going to treat them like prostitutes in real life and that's not wife material.
[3:40:11.040 --> 3:40:38.000]  And is it really making you happy? That 56% increase in suicide rates amongst 10-24 year
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  olds between 2007 and 2017 coinciding with the rise of social media. Is that not enough?
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:51.720]  The age of the ethos has socially indoctrinated girls and young women to think that it's normal
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:57.680]  to be intimate with the entire world. It's not. You're only supposed to be intimate with
[3:40:57.680 --> 3:41:03.240]  your relationship partner. You're only supposed to send sexy pics to your boyfriend. You're
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:08.200]  not supposed to share them with the entirety of simp nation. And if you do that, you're
[3:41:08.200 --> 3:41:12.840]  not a content creator, you're basically a sex worker. Is it any wonder that doctors
[3:41:12.840 --> 3:41:18.240]  are now on tiktok telling 12 year olds to get STD treatments without their parents'
[3:41:18.240 --> 3:41:33.080]  knowledge? Gross. And before you call me a misogynist, I just did a 50% off. I'm not
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:37.840]  a 15 minute video in which I explain how men are partially to blame for all this. Men who
[3:41:37.840 --> 3:41:45.960]  support their girl doing onlyfans have big dick energy. Men who support their girl prostituting
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:52.520]  herself to other men. Big dick energy. You misspelled cook. Why you're posting the empty
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:41:56.920]  egg carton underneath 18 year old girls? Like I like the enthusiasm but I don't think you
[3:41:56.920 --> 3:42:02.840]  get the meme because it's a warning and a prediction. Without intervention, the ethot
[3:42:02.840 --> 3:42:09.920]  is biologically predestined to become eggless. Social media and symptom is radicalizing an
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:15.080]  entire generation of zoomer girls to eschew traditional monogamous courtship and pursue
[3:42:15.080 --> 3:42:29.960]  degenerate hedonism. Yo, implant check. Stop chasing beta books, stop chasing clout, get
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:37.640]  off the Internet and find Mr Eggman. That is empty egg carton full video up on info
[3:42:37.640 --> 3:42:42.280]  wars dot com. Gonna come back after the break. Talk about Stephen King after being canceled
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:47.480]  for daring to suggest that art should be considered on its merits and not on the phony merits
[3:42:47.480 --> 3:42:59.920]  of diversity. Well, it's here. The year 2020. World governments out in the open. We've got
[3:42:59.920 --> 3:43:00.920]  the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer. And we've
[3:43:00.920 --> 3:43:06.920]  got massive huge censorship taking place. It's coordinated by big tech and banks against
[3:43:06.920 --> 3:43:13.360]  people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:18.560]  of the unborn. Wow. Yes, now we know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism
[3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:22.840]  is real. The pedophile leader real, but we're real as well. And we love God and we're standing
[3:43:22.840 --> 3:43:27.440]  up and saying no. But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we
[3:43:27.440 --> 3:43:32.960]  have never been in Kansas. We have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter.
[3:43:32.960 --> 3:43:38.040]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've
[3:43:38.040 --> 3:43:40.440]  gone through and everything we're going to go through. So it's an incredible time to
[3:43:40.440 --> 3:43:44.880]  be alive. I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved. But just remember

[3:49:11.880 --> 3:49:18.640]  out here in the Info War. Now we had an article a couple of weeks ago now about Stephen King
[3:49:18.640 --> 3:49:25.280]  the author in which he put out a tweet the headline is Stephen King savaged by woke mob
[3:49:25.280 --> 3:49:31.720]  for saying art should be judged on quality not diversity how dare he. He said quote as
[3:49:31.720 --> 3:49:37.920]  a writer I'm allowed to nominate in just three categories best picture best adapted screenplay
[3:49:37.920 --> 3:49:43.200]  and best original screenplay. He said for me the diversity issue as it applies to individual
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:49.560]  actors and directors did not come up. That said I would never consider diversity in matters
[3:49:49.560 --> 3:49:56.040]  of art only quality. It seems to me that to do otherwise would be wrong. So all he's saying
[3:49:56.040 --> 3:50:01.960]  is the art and the performance of actors the work the skill of directors should be judged
[3:50:01.960 --> 3:50:08.280]  on its quality on its merit not on the skin color of the person performing or directing
[3:50:08.280 --> 3:50:13.600]  or the fact that they have a certain genitalia. Now in 2020 that's apparently an extremist
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:20.600]  position because he immediately got canceled by the woke which finder generals. He apologized
[3:50:20.600 --> 3:50:25.880]  now he's apologizing again headline out of Sky News Stephen King Oscars are rigged in
[3:50:25.880 --> 3:50:33.000]  favor of white folks. So he's having to pay his penance now he's had the inquisition.
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:37.920]  He's having to genuflect and give it up. Stephen King has acknowledged the Oscars are rigged
[3:50:37.920 --> 3:50:42.720]  in favor of white people after coming into fire from previous comments about diversity.
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:47.320]  But diversity just means no white people. That's what it's come to mean in today's culture.
[3:50:47.320 --> 3:50:51.680]  He said writing an essay for the Washington Post. The author said that while progress
[3:50:51.680 --> 3:50:55.920]  have been made in terms of the demographic Academy Awards voters it is still not even
[3:50:55.920 --> 3:51:02.200]  within shouting distance of good enough. Really. Well here we have a list of black actors
[3:51:02.200 --> 3:51:08.440]  and actresses in Oscars over the last 20 years. I tweeted this 10 percent of best supporting
[3:51:08.440 --> 3:51:13.360]  actor winners are black 20 percent of best supporting actresses were black 15 percent
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:19.040]  of best leading actors were black. This is Oscar winners. 5 percent of leading actresses
[3:51:19.040 --> 3:51:26.400]  best leading actresses were black. When you do the percentage you come up with 12.5 percent.
[3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:33.200]  So that percentage is almost directly in line with the percentage of black people in America.
[3:51:33.200 --> 3:51:38.920]  It's in line with the demographic. So no there's no Oscars so white. It's a complete myth.
[3:51:38.920 --> 3:51:44.640]  And the fact that King is having to prostrate himself by telling what is at its heart an
[3:51:44.640 --> 3:51:50.400]  absolute mistruth of life only goes to show the power that these woke imbeciles wield
[3:51:50.400 --> 3:51:56.000]  over culture to the point now where you've got an institution like the BBC where there's
[3:51:56.000 --> 3:52:00.440]  a big debate over whether the license fee should be canceled mandatory license fee in
[3:52:00.440 --> 3:52:03.600]  this country. If you don't pay up they come and knock on your door and intimidate you
[3:52:03.600 --> 3:52:09.200]  and take you to court. There's a debate about whether that should go to a subscription model.
[3:52:09.200 --> 3:52:15.760]  The fact that it isn't a subscription model here in the UK with the BBC the state broadcaster
[3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:20.240]  means that they don't just put the propaganda. I mean you accept it with the BBC that everything's
[3:52:20.240 --> 3:52:25.120]  going to be left wing bias across the board in terms of news and current events and debate
[3:52:25.120 --> 3:52:32.120]  shows and it always is. There were routinely articles pointing out that if they had a debate
[3:52:32.120 --> 3:52:38.240]  about Brexit the panel would be five to one remainers to leave us or in some cases completely
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:44.880]  remainers. There was no ideological balance. There was no ideological diversity. The problem
[3:52:44.880 --> 3:52:51.840]  is woke imbecilic propaganda is now woven into literally every BBC production in terms
[3:52:51.840 --> 3:52:57.840]  of drama even in terms of things like sports coverage. So it's not just in the news. It's
[3:52:57.840 --> 3:53:03.480]  not just in current affairs or debate shows. They put the woke propaganda into things like
[3:53:03.480 --> 3:53:09.880]  Charles Dickens plays and stuff like that. They literally insert it into absolutely everything
[3:53:09.880 --> 3:53:15.600]  on a dramatic level on a fictional level. That's why the license fee has to be completely
[3:53:15.600 --> 3:53:20.720]  abolished because it's this tyranny of wokeness that they've inserted to socially engineer
[3:53:20.720 --> 3:53:25.360]  people because no one trusts them anymore in terms of their news and current affairs
[3:53:25.360 --> 3:53:30.280]  output which is a shame because you know there are a lot of talented people who work there
[3:53:30.280 --> 3:53:35.640]  who still produce great content. But again this goes back to the argument with art and
[3:53:35.640 --> 3:53:42.120]  specifically in art galleries and in theatres. If you don't interweave a woke progressive
[3:53:42.120 --> 3:53:47.000]  message in your art it's not going to get featured. It's not going to get reviewed. It's
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:52.560]  going to get trashed. And the people who do that who refuse to do that. There was a film
[3:53:52.560 --> 3:53:58.760]  recently by Guy Ritchie called The Gentleman because they had a couple of edgy jokes that
[3:53:58.760 --> 3:54:05.640]  were slightly racial very milk toast. It got absolutely panned by the critics. We saw that
[3:54:05.640 --> 3:54:11.240]  with Joker. We see it on Rotten Tomatoes with basically every movie that's popular with
[3:54:11.240 --> 3:54:15.920]  the punters with the people going to see the movie. But then it gets trashed by the woke
[3:54:15.920 --> 3:54:21.560]  journalists by the woke film reviewers because it either goes against the woke narrative
[3:54:21.560 --> 3:54:26.080]  or refuses to even play the game in the first place. That's why you have a show like Dave
[3:54:26.080 --> 3:54:32.720]  Chappelle's Comedy Special where it gets something like 95% approval from the viewing
[3:54:32.720 --> 3:54:39.760]  audience but then gets about 50-60% from the critics because he dared for about two minutes
[3:54:39.760 --> 3:54:44.960]  of his Comedy Special to say something not so nice about transgender people. Again it
[3:54:44.960 --> 3:54:50.440]  was quite milk toast but because he dared to do that the reviewers trashed his special
[3:54:50.440 --> 3:54:55.840]  some of them at least. So that's why you have the huge disparity between the critics reviews
[3:54:55.840 --> 3:55:01.760]  and the audience scores on websites like Rotten Tomatoes. And now Stephen King because he dared
[3:55:01.760 --> 3:55:07.520]  to go against the narrative to go against the woke grain, prostrated himself, apologized
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:12.200]  now he's having to apologize again. Hasn't learned the lesson. They see it's actually
[3:55:12.200 --> 3:55:20.120]  93% to 99% on Dave Chappelle's Comedy Special again emphasizing how this woke army of which
[3:55:20.120 --> 3:55:25.680]  finder generals are completely out of touch with reality. No one wants to listen to what
[3:55:25.680 --> 3:55:32.920]  they say. Meanwhile in Europe headline police investigating murder of pro-migration Finnish
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:39.440]  woman by her migrant boyfriend. Yeah another case of this of course we had the tragedy
[3:55:39.440 --> 3:55:45.240]  of the two Scandinavian backpackers back I think it was last year now or even late 2018
[3:55:45.240 --> 3:55:51.440]  it was on the cusp of the year. They went to Morocco for a hiking trip in literal ISIS
[3:55:51.440 --> 3:55:57.320]  territory on their own as two women ended up getting beheaded. Absolutely tragedy but
[3:55:57.320 --> 3:56:02.480]  then the Facebook posts of one of these victims were traced back and she was on Facebook virtue
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:07.160]  signaling about how people are being mean to Muslims and you shouldn't judge Muslims
[3:56:07.160 --> 3:56:11.320]  and you shouldn't be bigoted you shouldn't be xenophobic. We've had many other cases
[3:56:11.320 --> 3:56:15.680]  where literal immigration activists get kidnapped by migrants because in many cases they let
[3:56:15.680 --> 3:56:19.760]  them into their home. They get raped they get murdered. Now it appears like we have
[3:56:19.760 --> 3:56:25.080]  another similar case. Police in Finland are investigating the murder of a woman killed
[3:56:25.080 --> 3:56:31.600]  by her migrant ex-boyfriend after making pro-mass migration posts on social media. She was reportedly
[3:56:31.600 --> 3:56:37.920]  killed by Hassan Alkina who is a Palestinian asylum seeker. Again this is in Finland. Some
[3:56:37.920 --> 3:56:42.680]  people claim she was beheaded that's not being confirmed but from the photos you see blood
[3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:47.880]  oozing out from underneath the door of the apartment. Reportedly they had an argument
[3:56:47.880 --> 3:56:52.960]  she was trying to leave him he wouldn't let her so he killed her and then again reportedly
[3:56:52.960 --> 3:57:00.040]  committed suicide. The source of the claim that the woman had made a pro-mass migration
[3:57:00.040 --> 3:57:07.960]  post on social media was a Finnish commentator called Tina Wick who said that the woman wrote
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:14.480]  that white men are crappy. Another word for that. So basically she did a mass virtue signal
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:20.640]  on social media about how mass migration was wonderful about how white people were terrible.
[3:57:20.640 --> 3:57:25.120]  He had a migrant boyfriend they had an argument he killed her then committed suicide now she's
[3:57:25.120 --> 3:57:31.680]  dead yet another tragedy but perhaps yet another example of cultural relativism and we're going
[3:57:31.680 --> 3:57:41.560]  to see a lot more of that given the amount of mass migration flooding into Europe.
