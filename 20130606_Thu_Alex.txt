[00:00.000 --> 00:09.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.800 --> 00:10.800]  You want answers?
[00:10.800 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:24.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.480 --> 00:28.560]  Welcome to the Infowars Alex Jones Show.
[00:28.560 --> 00:31.200]  I'm David Knight, and I'm standing in for Alex Jones.
[00:31.200 --> 00:33.520]  He's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:33.520 --> 00:35.120]  We've got a lot of breaking news.
[00:35.120 --> 00:36.160]  I'm sure you're hearing it.
[00:36.160 --> 00:41.240]  Even the mainstream media is covering the fact that the government is spying on everyone,
[00:41.240 --> 00:43.400]  looking at all of our phone records.
[00:43.400 --> 00:46.960]  You know, there's an old ad from one of the phone companies that said, can you hear me
[00:46.960 --> 00:47.960]  now?
[00:47.960 --> 00:51.600]  Well, I guess the question is, can you hear the tyranny now?
[00:51.600 --> 00:56.720]  We've been talking about this for a long time, and I can hear it in the background, can't
[00:56.720 --> 00:57.720]  you?
[00:57.720 --> 01:02.280]  It's getting louder and louder, and for those of us who've been watching this for very long,
[01:02.280 --> 01:05.920]  it is getting deafening, and we're getting sick of this.
[01:05.920 --> 01:07.800]  This is something that isn't new.
[01:07.800 --> 01:11.700]  This is something that is newly getting the attention of the mainstream media.
[01:11.700 --> 01:15.280]  They haven't been paying attention, and most of the public hasn't been paying attention.
[01:15.280 --> 01:20.240]  You know, this breaking story from The Guardian, and here's some of the headlines.
[01:20.240 --> 01:21.240]  Let me just read you.
[01:21.240 --> 01:28.520]  The Guardian says, NSA is collecting phone records of millions of Verizon customers daily.
[01:28.520 --> 01:36.000]  This is a classified document that Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian leaked out, and kudos to him
[01:36.000 --> 01:38.760]  and kudos to the whistleblower who put this out.
[01:38.760 --> 01:40.440]  People need to see this stuff.
[01:40.440 --> 01:41.440]  Here's some more.
[01:41.440 --> 01:42.680]  Even The New York Times is covering this.
[01:42.680 --> 01:43.680]  How about that?
[01:43.680 --> 01:46.040]  US is secretly collecting records of Verizon calls.
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.040]  Who would imagine that?
[01:47.040 --> 01:48.640]  The New York Times would tell us that.
[01:48.640 --> 01:54.440]  We've also got AP saying government scooping up Verizon phone records.
[01:54.440 --> 01:57.160]  Obama administration defends phone record collection.
[01:57.160 --> 02:00.760]  This is coming from the business and financial news.
[02:00.760 --> 02:08.560]  We've got Forbes, NSA, Verizon spying order, specifically targeted Americans and not foreigners.
[02:08.560 --> 02:12.280]  See, that's the point here.
[02:12.280 --> 02:16.520]  Ron Paul pointed this out, and we've pointed this out.
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.440]  The FISA Act is a foreign intelligence surveillance act.
[02:20.440 --> 02:26.400]  Now, if you allow your government to act like criminals abroad, they're going to act like
[02:26.400 --> 02:27.520]  criminals domestically.
[02:27.520 --> 02:32.720]  They're going to be even more likely to act like criminals domestically because this is
[02:32.720 --> 02:33.720]  their turf.
[02:33.720 --> 02:39.800]  They're basically a large gang, and when you allow them to kill people like this drone
[02:39.800 --> 02:43.160]  list kill, they're going to kill people in the US in the same way.
[02:43.160 --> 02:44.720]  It's just a matter of time.
[02:44.720 --> 02:51.640]  We've already got the FBI picking up witnesses or people who are just connected to the patsies
[02:51.640 --> 02:55.680]  that they're using for this bombing and killing them, shooting them six times, plus one in
[02:55.680 --> 02:58.360]  the back of the head for good measure.
[02:58.360 --> 03:02.920]  We've got the CBS talking about the Department of Homeland Security now says laptops and
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.680]  phones can be searched based on hunches.
[03:06.680 --> 03:08.840]  Oh, I've got a hunch.
[03:08.840 --> 03:11.120]  I don't have reasonable cause.
[03:11.120 --> 03:12.760]  I don't have a search warrant.
[03:12.760 --> 03:15.320]  I don't have constitutional authority.
[03:15.320 --> 03:17.440]  I've got a hunch.
[03:17.440 --> 03:22.680]  Let me have access to all your private papers, your personal effects.
[03:22.680 --> 03:29.160]  We've got WorldNet Daily, WND says now the FBI wants to backdoor it all software.
[03:29.160 --> 03:31.480]  Certainly we can trust those guys, right?
[03:31.480 --> 03:33.400]  They're trustworthy.
[03:33.400 --> 03:36.520]  We can give them access to everybody's information.
[03:36.520 --> 03:41.960]  From Business Insider, the same federal judge who struck down Obamacare approved the government's
[03:41.960 --> 03:44.080]  sweeping collection of phone records.
[03:44.080 --> 03:45.840]  We'll talk about that a little bit.
[03:45.840 --> 03:47.400]  Of course, Ron Paul.
[03:47.400 --> 03:50.800]  Ron Paul warned us about this back in September.
[03:50.800 --> 03:53.320]  This is what he said, September the 12th, 2012.
[03:53.320 --> 03:55.560]  This is before Ron Paul retired.
[03:55.560 --> 03:58.080]  This is at the very end of his congressional career.
[03:58.080 --> 04:04.040]  He said, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to reauthorization of 2008 FISA Amendments
[04:04.040 --> 04:08.160]  Act as it violates the Fourth Amendment of our Constitution.
[04:08.160 --> 04:12.360]  Members of this reauthorization claim the U.S. will be more vulnerable if the government
[04:12.360 --> 04:15.120]  is not allowed to monitor citizens without a warrant.
[04:15.120 --> 04:20.240]  I would argue, this is Ron Paul saying this, that we are more vulnerable if we do allow
[04:20.240 --> 04:23.160]  the government to monitor Americans without a warrant.
[04:23.160 --> 04:26.680]  Nothing makes us more vulnerable than allowing the Constitution to be violated.
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.560]  That's right, because what we do is we turn the government into criminals.
[04:30.560 --> 04:32.760]  We turn the government into terrorists.
[04:32.760 --> 04:38.400]  You are eight times more likely to be shot by a police officer than to be killed by
[04:38.400 --> 04:39.400]  a terrorist.
[04:39.400 --> 04:40.880]  That's the government's own figures.
[04:40.880 --> 04:45.040]  We're going to look into that, and we've got a lot of information about Bilderberg,
[04:45.040 --> 04:48.080]  and Alex is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[04:48.080 --> 04:49.080]  So stay tuned.
[04:49.080 --> 05:00.080]  We'll be right back.
[05:00.080 --> 05:03.280]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.320]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[05:08.320 --> 05:14.360]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[05:14.360 --> 05:15.360]  to the global takeover.
[05:15.360 --> 05:21.320]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.
[05:21.320 --> 05:25.320]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[05:29.480 --> 05:30.480]  go.
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.720]  The K-Tour Hand Crank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.720]  in the field.

[07:15.520 --> 07:16.520]  acid.
[07:16.520 --> 07:22.040]  This manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new aqua medics

[08:21.080 --> 08:35.640]  Yeah, look around you, all you see are sympathetic guys and I look around me, all I see are government
[08:35.640 --> 08:41.240]  surveillance cameras and I know that they're just trying to help me help myself, right?
[08:41.240 --> 08:44.000]  They're just to provide security for you.
[08:44.000 --> 08:45.840]  They want to make you safe.
[08:45.840 --> 08:51.360]  People who protects us from our protectors who watches the watchers and they're totally
[08:51.360 --> 08:57.640]  out of control as we've been talking about the release of the court order that it was
[08:57.640 --> 09:06.080]  a classified document and it is leaked out now through The Guardian that all of Verizon
[09:06.080 --> 09:13.320]  customers are being turned over to the FBI and to the NSA to basically look at who you're
[09:13.320 --> 09:16.720]  calling, when you called, that sort of thing.
[09:16.720 --> 09:24.640]  And it is specifically targeted at Americans, not foreigners, as if that really made a difference.
[09:24.640 --> 09:28.720]  They've used this before to say that, well, if an American is calling abroad, we're now
[09:28.720 --> 09:31.200]  going to listen to that American's call as well.
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.080]  And if you look at the information of what they're doing here, this is exactly the same
[09:36.080 --> 09:40.400]  information that they collected on the AP.
[09:40.400 --> 09:46.920]  We said at the time that this was when they came out and told the AP that they were looking
[09:46.920 --> 09:50.000]  at who they were calling and the time of date and that sort of thing.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.600]  We said at the time, they're doing that all the time.
[09:52.600 --> 09:58.040]  They're not just doing that, they're also recording their messages, their entire messages.
[09:58.040 --> 10:01.040]  That's the whole point of the Utah data center.
[10:01.040 --> 10:03.960]  That's something that's coming online later this year.
[10:03.960 --> 10:08.200]  And this is something that we really need to think about just to put this in perspective.
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.880]  We're going to have Yotabites worth of data at the Utah data center.
[10:12.880 --> 10:14.800]  Now what is a Yotabyte?
[10:14.800 --> 10:18.680]  It's a trillion terabytes, so it's a trillion trillion.
[10:18.680 --> 10:20.120]  It's astronomical.
[10:20.120 --> 10:21.120]  Think about this.
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.880]  Just to put this in perspective, you've got an $80 two terabyte drive that you can get
[10:25.880 --> 10:27.440]  right now called in my book.
[10:27.440 --> 10:29.400]  It's about two inches wide.
[10:29.400 --> 10:31.600]  I've worked out these figures here.
[10:31.600 --> 10:33.600]  Now how many of these things would you have?
[10:33.600 --> 10:34.600]  They have multiple Yotabytes.
[10:34.600 --> 10:38.040]  We don't know how many Yotabytes, so let's just say two Yotabytes.
[10:38.040 --> 10:41.680]  You're only going to have two Yotabytes at the Utah data center.
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.840]  So how many of these two terabyte drives that you can get now called my book?
[10:45.840 --> 10:50.840]  How many of those would you have to stack side by side to have two terabytes?
[10:50.840 --> 10:52.680]  Put this in perspective.
[10:52.680 --> 10:54.280]  Well this my book is pretty small.
[10:54.280 --> 10:56.840]  It's only about two inches wide.
[10:56.840 --> 11:04.040]  If you were to stack these things to have a trillion of them, you would have 167 billion
[11:04.040 --> 11:12.840]  feet or 31 and a half, 31 million, 31 and a half million miles of these drives stacked.
[11:12.840 --> 11:15.360]  That's two Yotabytes.
[11:15.360 --> 11:19.840]  That's only two of the many Yotabytes that they're going to have at the Utah data center.
[11:19.840 --> 11:25.680]  So you'd have 31,000 and a half miles of these my book drives stacked.
[11:25.680 --> 11:26.680]  How far is that?
[11:26.680 --> 11:30.640]  Well the distance to the moon is only 238,000 miles.
[11:30.640 --> 11:32.680]  This is 31 and a half million miles.
[11:32.680 --> 11:35.400]  If you want to go to Mars, that's 48 million miles.
[11:35.400 --> 11:39.640]  So it's kind of like that to give you an idea of how long it would take to travel to Mars.
[11:39.640 --> 11:45.440]  If you're traveling by car at 70 miles an hour to Mars, assuming you could, 228 years.
[11:45.440 --> 11:49.720]  Or if you're traveling by jet, 747 speed would be 32 years.
[11:49.720 --> 11:54.280]  Or if you're going by spaceship at 25,000 miles per hour, it would still take you eight
[11:54.280 --> 11:56.720]  and a half months to get to Mars.
[11:56.720 --> 12:03.520]  That's the distance that you would be stacking these my book drives if you had just the minimum
[12:03.520 --> 12:06.640]  amount of data that they're going to have at the Utah data center.
[12:06.640 --> 12:10.160]  Now, of course, they've got some technology that we don't have that's going to have that
[12:10.160 --> 12:15.360]  data at a much denser storage area.
[12:15.360 --> 12:21.320]  But the point is, this is an astronomical, truly astronomical amount of data that's being
[12:21.320 --> 12:22.800]  stored at the Utah data center.
[12:22.800 --> 12:25.600]  Why do they need that kind of data storage?
[12:25.600 --> 12:30.400]  Because they are collecting every bit of electronic communication from every person
[12:30.400 --> 12:32.720]  on Earth for future data mining.
[12:32.720 --> 12:37.440]  Now, they don't have the capability to do all the data mining that they want now.
[12:37.440 --> 12:39.280]  But believe me, they will.
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.560]  What you're looking at is something kind of like the Terminator, where they're going
[12:42.560 --> 12:47.200]  to, sometime in the future, they're going to go into your past and they're going to find
[12:47.200 --> 12:49.680]  information about you to incriminate you.
[12:49.680 --> 12:53.000]  You don't have anything to worry about, do you?
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.280]  What if you don't agree with the government's political views?
[12:56.280 --> 12:59.960]  What if your religion becomes outlawed?
[12:59.960 --> 13:03.200]  What if they want to blackmail you into doing something?
[13:03.200 --> 13:05.160]  Well, they are going to have the data.
[13:05.160 --> 13:09.400]  They're going to have your entire past set up at the Utah data center.
[13:09.400 --> 13:15.320]  And the question is, now that we know about this, we don't just need another church committee
[13:15.320 --> 13:16.320]  hearing.
[13:16.320 --> 13:22.800]  Like in the 70s, Frank Church had a oversight committee that exposed a lot of the criminal
[13:22.800 --> 13:30.040]  actions of the CIA and a few other actions of people that had come to this country under
[13:30.040 --> 13:37.960]  Operation Paperclip and were involved in some really shady biological, chemical, drug types
[13:37.960 --> 13:40.760]  of things for the CIA and for the government.
[13:40.760 --> 13:46.320]  That's where you had the CIA director Colby hold up his heart attack gun, talking about
[13:46.320 --> 13:49.000]  assassinations, that sort of thing.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.880]  There were some little bit of reforms that came out of that, but not much.
[13:52.880 --> 13:53.880]  Not much.
[13:53.880 --> 13:58.800]  And once George Bush got back into place in the CIA thing, it was business as usual.
[13:58.800 --> 14:00.600]  We need to see some real reforms.
[14:00.600 --> 14:05.760]  We need to see some politicians step up, like maybe Rand Paul or Ted Cruz.
[14:05.760 --> 14:10.960]  We need to see the Utah data center be shut down.
[14:10.960 --> 14:14.080]  We need to see some civil liberties put back in.
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.200]  We need to see the Patriot Act revoked.
[14:17.200 --> 14:22.120]  And we need to see some of these people go to jail because their laws are unlawful, their
[14:22.120 --> 14:23.880]  actions are unlawful.
[14:23.880 --> 14:29.240]  And even when they've got a law like FISA that asserts that they have the right to listen
[14:29.240 --> 14:34.440]  to people's phone calls abroad, and Americans if they're calling abroad, even when they
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.760]  make that bold unconstitutional assertion, they don't even stick to the limits and the
[14:39.760 --> 14:42.040]  parameters of these unconstitutional laws.
[14:42.040 --> 14:44.560]  They go far beyond that.
[14:44.560 --> 14:47.680]  Well today is the beginning of Bilderberg.
[14:47.680 --> 14:51.120]  And before we get into that, before we get into that, I wanted to play one other thing
[14:51.120 --> 14:52.120]  I almost forgot.
[14:52.120 --> 14:57.000]  We've got, we don't want to forget that this information that hopefully is going to wake
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  people up.
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.160]  Again, it's nothing new, but we appreciate the fact that this has been made public.
[15:03.160 --> 15:07.960]  This document has been leaked, the secret court finding has been leaked.
[15:07.960 --> 15:10.720]  And that was done by a whistleblower.
[15:10.720 --> 15:15.520]  And I want you to think about that because right now, it's not only today as the, Chris
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.360]  Jordan just told me, this is the 64th anniversary of 1984.
[15:20.360 --> 15:24.280]  And I think we can all hear the clocks striking 13.
[15:24.280 --> 15:26.840]  Something is very definitely wrong in America.
[15:26.840 --> 15:34.080]  Unfortunately, we had a whistleblower release this information to the reporter at The Guardian.
[15:34.080 --> 15:36.880]  And we should think about Bradley Manning.
[15:36.880 --> 15:38.360]  Think about what he did.
[15:38.360 --> 15:40.040]  Think about the ordeal that he's gone through.
[15:40.040 --> 15:41.400]  Think about how he's been punished.
[15:41.400 --> 15:46.000]  And we've got a video here that we're going to cut into called, I am Bradley Manning.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  Guys, come on in.
[15:47.000 --> 15:53.120]  When you join the military, are you asked to keep any war crimes you might see secret?
[15:53.120 --> 16:02.720]  You see something that's so wrong, item all up, it's very hard for a lower leveled soldier
[16:02.720 --> 16:09.600]  to turn on his officers and say there was a war crime.
[16:09.600 --> 16:16.440]  The whole concept of whistleblower laws are you cannot get into trouble for reporting about
[16:16.440 --> 16:18.160]  illegal or improper activity.
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.360]  I think we have to be clear that the cables were not top secret documents.
[16:23.360 --> 16:28.800]  It's an absurd charge to give an aid and comfort to the enemy.
[16:28.800 --> 16:34.040]  If you saw incredible things, awful things, things that belonged in the public domain,
[16:34.040 --> 16:38.400]  and not on-site servers, stored in a dark room in Washington, D.C., what would you
[16:38.400 --> 16:39.400]  do?
[16:39.400 --> 16:40.400]  What would you do?
[16:40.400 --> 16:41.400]  What would you do?
[16:41.400 --> 16:42.400]  What would you do?
[16:42.400 --> 16:43.840]  I was Bradley Manning.
[16:43.840 --> 16:45.520]  I am Bradley Manning.
[16:45.520 --> 16:46.520]  I am Bradley Manning.
[16:46.520 --> 16:47.520]  I am Bradley Manning.
[16:47.520 --> 16:48.520]  Bradley Manning.
[16:48.520 --> 16:49.520]  I am Bradley Manning.
[16:49.520 --> 16:50.520]  Bradley Manning.
[16:50.520 --> 16:51.520]  Bradley Manning.
[16:51.520 --> 16:52.520]  Bradley Manning.
[16:52.520 --> 16:54.680]  I hope that we are all Bradley Manning.
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.320]  And now what do we do about this?
[16:56.320 --> 16:59.720]  If you know nothing about Bradley Manning, you should find out and then you should help
[16:59.720 --> 17:01.440]  me, Luss de Montagion.
[17:01.440 --> 17:03.360]  That's right.
[17:03.360 --> 17:08.360]  If you see something that's wrong and you're a government employee, you have an obligation
[17:08.360 --> 17:09.640]  to tell people about that.
[17:09.640 --> 17:14.720]  Unfortunately, somebody did just that with this leak of this secretive court order.
[17:14.720 --> 17:20.000]  Now, of course, the Obama administration replies that a senior administration official did
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.400]  not specifically confirm the report, but noted that the published court order pertains only
[17:25.400 --> 17:29.560]  to data such as the telephone number or the link to the call, and not the subscribers
[17:29.560 --> 17:32.120]  identities or the content of the telephone calls.
[17:32.120 --> 17:35.320]  Yeah, that's under a different secret order.
[17:35.320 --> 17:38.200]  We know that's what they're going to be doing at the Utah Data Center.
[17:38.200 --> 17:44.120]  But the interesting thing is that this article then from Reuters goes in and tries to put
[17:44.120 --> 17:45.120]  a spin on it.
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.600]  And they say, well, this was issued one week after US law enforcement officials tracked
[17:49.600 --> 17:53.600]  down two brothers suspected of carrying out the deadly Boston Marathon bombing.
[17:53.600 --> 17:54.600]  Come on.
[17:54.600 --> 17:59.920]  They don't have to get the phone records of every subscriber, millions of subscribers
[17:59.920 --> 18:02.120]  across the United States from Verizon.
[18:02.120 --> 18:06.600]  Just because the Boston bombing, is that going to become the excuse for everything?
[18:06.600 --> 18:12.320]  Martial law across the country spying on people like the East German Stasi state on steroids?
[18:12.320 --> 18:16.600]  We've got a Forbes article here that says NSA's Verizon spying order was specifically
[18:16.600 --> 18:20.160]  targeted Americans and not foreigners.
[18:20.160 --> 18:24.680]  This is why they say the latest revelation of the extent of NSA's surveillance shows
[18:24.680 --> 18:29.480]  that it is focused specifically on Americans to the degree that its data collection has
[18:29.480 --> 18:37.680]  in at least one major spying incident explicitly excluded those outside of the United States.
[18:37.680 --> 18:43.640]  They pass a law that says that they can listen without warrants to people.
[18:43.640 --> 18:49.760]  And understand too that the Constitution says persons, it doesn't say citizens.
[18:49.760 --> 18:55.000]  We want to try to think that the government can act like criminals and mafia people to
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.600]  foreigners and in other countries and it doesn't affect us.
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.800]  That simply isn't true.
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.560]  When you allow them to do that to anyone, you're setting up a precedent.
[19:06.560 --> 19:12.040]  And so now we have this FISA act that was put in that in my opinion violates the letter
[19:12.040 --> 19:17.440]  and the spirit of the law saying that government doesn't spy on persons and now they're explicitly
[19:17.440 --> 19:22.560]  doing it to those in the United States and excluding foreigners in this particular case.
[19:22.560 --> 19:28.480]  CBS says since his election, President Obama has taken an expansive view of legal authorities
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.160]  in the name of national security, do you think?
[19:32.160 --> 19:33.160]  That's an understatement.
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.520]  But they do go on to say he's asserted that he can order the deaths of U.S. citizens abroad
[19:37.520 --> 19:41.880]  who are suspected of terrorism, that involvement by courts, investigate reporters as criminals
[19:41.880 --> 19:47.640]  and in this case, read and copy the contents of computers carried by U.S. travelers without
[19:47.640 --> 19:51.200]  a good reason to suspect wrongdoing.
[19:51.200 --> 19:54.800]  Well we're going to come back and we're going to talk in the next segment about Bilderberg
[19:54.800 --> 19:56.960]  because today it is starting in earnest.
[19:56.960 --> 20:04.720]  It's just been a prelude up to this point, we'll be right back.
[20:04.720 --> 20:10.160]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[20:10.160 --> 20:16.000]  Burglars call it smash and grab, police call it robbery, we call it avoidable.
[20:16.000 --> 20:22.120]  We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[20:22.120 --> 20:27.440]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[20:27.440 --> 20:32.080]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move
[20:32.080 --> 20:34.680]  on to an easier target.
[20:34.680 --> 20:40.600]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with
[20:40.600 --> 20:41.600]  free shipping.
[20:41.600 --> 20:48.760]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[20:48.760 --> 20:54.920]  Call 877-5-3-2-5-3-8-8 or faketv.com.
[20:54.920 --> 21:24.880]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[21:25.920 --> 21:33.880]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[21:33.880 --> 21:38.120]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[21:38.120 --> 21:39.120]  to serve as debt.
[21:39.120 --> 21:42.640]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[21:42.640 --> 21:45.920]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[21:45.920 --> 21:49.440]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary
[21:49.440 --> 21:50.440]  system.
[21:50.440 --> 21:53.440]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[21:53.440 --> 21:54.880]  It's time to understand the system.
[21:54.880 --> 21:55.880]  Call 800-686-2237.
[21:55.880 --> 21:56.880]  That's 800-686-2237.
[21:56.880 --> 22:03.480]  Hi, I'm Steve Shank, founder of eFoods Direct.
[22:03.480 --> 22:08.400]  Right now we have a huge number of Americans that are in serious trouble, right smack dab
[22:08.400 --> 22:10.800]  in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters.
[22:10.800 --> 22:15.480]  I know that thousands of you, like us, are frustrated with not being able to help those
[22:15.480 --> 22:18.320]  who have lost so much and are in so much pain.
[22:18.320 --> 22:20.440]  We can't stand idly by.
[22:20.440 --> 22:24.360]  Food is the best way to help the victims and support the relief effort.
[22:24.360 --> 22:28.560]  We have a plan for any of you who would like to partner with us in providing food in this
[22:28.560 --> 22:30.200]  desperate time of need.
[22:30.200 --> 22:35.560]  We've built a seven-day emergency food package containing breakfast, lunch and dinner for
[22:35.560 --> 22:39.600]  a whole week for one adult valued at $60.
[22:39.600 --> 22:44.560]  Your $25 will ship this life-saving supply directly to those in need.
[22:44.560 --> 22:52.440]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[22:52.440 --> 22:54.960]  That's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[22:54.960 --> 22:57.760]  The food is contributed at considerably less than cost.
[22:57.760 --> 22:59.760]  Thank you.
[22:59.760 --> 23:03.700]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[23:03.700 --> 23:05.080]  That bears repeating.
[23:05.080 --> 23:08.600]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[23:08.600 --> 23:13.160]  And pro-EM1 daily probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health.
[23:13.160 --> 23:18.240]  Pro-EM1 is a powerful liquid probiotic, strong enough to cleanse, gentle enough to use every
[23:18.240 --> 23:19.240]  day.
[23:19.240 --> 23:24.040]  Pro-EM1 is dairy, wheat and soy-free, contains all-natural and certified organic ingredients,
[23:24.040 --> 23:28.360]  contains no preservatives or animal products, supports a healthy digestive and immune system,
[23:28.360 --> 23:31.800]  supports weight loss, improves absorption of food nutrients, aids in controlling yeast
[23:31.800 --> 23:36.800]  infections, is never freeze-ride, and uses three groups of live viable beneficial microbes
[23:36.800 --> 23:38.520]  to cleanse and remove toxins.
[23:38.520 --> 23:55.160]  Pro-EM1 daily probiotic cleanse at tarragonix.com or call toll free 866-369-3678 that's 866-369-3678.
[23:55.160 --> 24:14.600]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[24:14.600 --> 24:15.600]  All right, we're back.
[24:15.600 --> 24:19.640]  I'm David Knight standing in for Alex Jones, the Alex Jones radio show, and Alex is going
[24:19.640 --> 24:23.200]  to be joining us in just a few minutes at the bottom of the hour.
[24:23.200 --> 24:30.680]  He is in London, just north of London at Watford, UK, covering Bilderberg, and today it starts
[24:30.680 --> 24:31.680]  in earnest.
[24:31.680 --> 24:35.640]  He's been there for a couple of days, and it's been a prelude to things getting set
[24:35.640 --> 24:36.640]  up.
[24:36.640 --> 24:40.600]  There's a lot of preparations to be made, even though they've had operation discusses,
[24:40.600 --> 24:43.320]  they call it going on for 18 months.
[24:43.320 --> 24:49.640]  There were giant fences that had to be put around this massive compound, this luxury
[24:49.640 --> 24:55.080]  hotel, kind of like I turned it into a concentration camp with all the guards and everything.
[24:55.080 --> 24:59.560]  So they've been busy doing last minute preparations like that, kicking journalists out of restaurants,
[24:59.560 --> 25:03.040]  cancelling reservations, that sort of thing.
[25:03.040 --> 25:07.160]  Today they're starting to arrive, and today we've got, there you go, if you're watching
[25:07.160 --> 25:08.720]  that you see some of the preparations.
[25:08.720 --> 25:16.560]  Alex was there when they were putting these massive concrete blocks out, and now they've
[25:16.560 --> 25:20.160]  turned, if you've got a shot on them, if you've got a shot of that somewhere, they've essentially
[25:20.160 --> 25:22.440]  turned the place into a concentration camp.
[25:22.440 --> 25:26.440]  It looks like this beautiful luxury hotel out in the middle of England, and of course
[25:26.440 --> 25:30.320]  they're enacting police state tactics against people who are just trying to go out and walk
[25:30.320 --> 25:31.320]  their dog.
[25:31.320 --> 25:37.400]  If you go to our Ustream live feed, and you can find everything at infowars.com forward
[25:37.400 --> 25:43.520]  slash B as in Bilderberg, you'll see our reports, our live reports that they're putting up there
[25:43.520 --> 25:51.560]  from Bilderberg on Ustream, and yesterday Leanne got some video of a guy who was walking
[25:51.560 --> 25:56.000]  his dogs, or at least trying to walk his dogs, and he said, you mean I can't walk my dogs
[25:56.000 --> 25:57.400]  because they're having this meeting?
[25:57.400 --> 25:59.280]  Yeah, but it's nothing really to worry about.
[25:59.280 --> 26:03.600]  There's also another video that you must see, where the BBC came out and said they wanted
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.440]  to interview Alex, and she did everything she could to try to provoke him to an rant.
[26:08.440 --> 26:13.320]  And Alex does a great job of talking about, it's amazing, he's talking about how the
[26:13.320 --> 26:18.760]  media has for years, for decades, ignored this, downplayed this, even when he had footage
[26:18.760 --> 26:21.440]  of it, they said it didn't exist.
[26:21.440 --> 26:25.360]  And then the lady is saying, oh, but it's just a conspiracy theory, isn't it?
[26:25.360 --> 26:27.080]  It's amazing footage to see.
[26:27.080 --> 26:31.320]  Unfortunately, we can't hear her as well as we would like to, because Leanne was taking
[26:31.320 --> 26:37.040]  pictures of her, and she would not say anything, and she broke off Alex before the interview,
[26:37.040 --> 26:41.440]  looks directly at Leanne and says, who are you?
[26:41.440 --> 26:45.320]  Leanne said, I'm not going to talk as long as you're recording, so she had to go away.
[26:45.320 --> 26:50.360]  But somebody got a recording of at least what Alex was saying, and his reactions to what
[26:50.360 --> 26:52.040]  she was saying, so you can tell about that.
[26:52.040 --> 26:56.240]  Now, today they're showing up at Bilderberg, and here's a headline from The Guardian.
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.760]  Bilderberg, 2013 delegates arrive in blacked out cars for their secretive summit.
[27:01.760 --> 27:07.520]  Isn't it interesting that we've talked for most of this show about how our government
[27:07.520 --> 27:14.240]  is looking at everybody's phone conversations, everybody's records, they're micromanaging
[27:14.240 --> 27:19.920]  every bit of information about us, saving it to data mine, and yet we can't even look
[27:19.920 --> 27:22.760]  at our royalty who is attending Bilderberg.
[27:22.760 --> 27:24.560]  Just amazing, the double standard.
[27:24.560 --> 27:27.200]  Here's some of the headlines at Infowars.
[27:27.200 --> 27:29.600]  Bilderberg member is set to speak on the record.
[27:29.600 --> 27:33.240]  Participant of the secret confab is set to talk with the BBC.
[27:33.240 --> 27:37.000]  I'm sure that's going to be a great standup article, it's probably going to be a move
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.680]  along, there's nothing to see here, we're just trying to keep the world spinning.
[27:42.680 --> 27:49.160]  And of course that has to be done by corporations meeting in secret with politicians.
[27:49.160 --> 27:54.160]  At the very same time that in the UK they've got a massive lobbying scandal, and it hasn't
[27:54.160 --> 27:56.320]  been that long since we've had lobbying scandals.
[27:56.320 --> 27:57.320]  Remember Jack Abramoff?
[27:57.320 --> 28:00.160]  Of course there was nothing to see there, we just move along, I'm sure he was just playing
[28:00.160 --> 28:02.160]  golf with people.
[28:02.160 --> 28:08.320]  So massive police operation effect as Bilderberg confab convenes.
[28:08.320 --> 28:12.720]  What we talked about earlier, residents experiencing a virtual police state.
[28:12.720 --> 28:18.200]  And listen to this, the would be world's biggest oil merger is agreed at Bilderberg from Steve
[28:18.200 --> 28:19.200]  Watson.
[28:19.200 --> 28:24.440]  Shell and BP deal would be the biggest corporate deal ever.
[28:24.440 --> 28:28.200]  That's the kind of stuff, of course we can't know what's going on there and it's not just
[28:28.200 --> 28:33.880]  deals that are going on between private companies, the same kind of deals are going on between
[28:33.880 --> 28:38.960]  the corporations who control these politicians and the politicians who are going to implement
[28:38.960 --> 28:41.600]  their plans for world governments.
[28:41.600 --> 28:45.840]  They're breaking everything down into right now into trade zones.
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.560]  Europe is one of the key ones, the Euro and the European Union is one of the key trade
[28:49.560 --> 28:51.800]  zones, NAFTA is the other one.
[28:51.800 --> 28:55.360]  Once they can get those two in place it's going to be very easy to break the entire
[28:55.360 --> 29:00.400]  world into 10 trade zones, Africa will be another one and so forth.
[29:00.400 --> 29:03.880]  Then just consolidate everything into one world government.
[29:03.880 --> 29:10.240]  And so what we have here at Bilderberg is world governance by a global elite who are
[29:10.240 --> 29:11.360]  agreeing to this agenda.
[29:11.360 --> 29:16.520]  We've seen leaked memos and the BBC knows that these memos are out there.
[29:16.520 --> 29:19.800]  They've actually reported on them in the past, they've reported on the Wicked League documents
[29:19.800 --> 29:22.440]  exposing Bilderberg memos.
[29:22.440 --> 29:25.200]  Also the media is complicit in the Bilderberg cover up, yeah you think?
[29:25.200 --> 29:28.360]  We're going to be talking about that right after the break and Alex is going to be joining
[29:28.360 --> 29:30.040]  us in just a few minutes.
[29:30.040 --> 29:36.880]  So stay tuned, he's there with Leanne McAdoo and Paul and Steve Watson and also Richard
[29:36.880 --> 29:40.240]  Reeves is doing some camera work and staff stuff so we're going to be talking to all
[29:40.240 --> 29:49.880]  of them in just a few minutes, stay tuned.
[29:49.880 --> 30:04.560]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run.
[30:04.560 --> 30:05.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:05.560 --> 30:06.560]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[30:06.560 --> 30:07.560]  tyranny is here.
[30:07.560 --> 30:08.560]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[30:08.560 --> 30:12.200]  It really says that the state is God.
[30:12.200 --> 30:16.720]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[30:16.720 --> 30:17.960]  on earth.
[30:17.960 --> 30:22.800]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[30:22.800 --> 30:24.640]  expanded nationwide.
[30:24.640 --> 30:28.920]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old
[30:28.920 --> 30:30.520]  powerful shadow state.
[30:30.520 --> 30:34.720]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[30:34.720 --> 30:39.200]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[30:39.200 --> 30:45.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.480]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[30:48.480 --> 30:50.560]  The police state isn't coming.
[30:50.560 --> 30:51.560]  It's here.

[31:01.280 --> 31:04.080]  Hi I'm Steve Shank, founder of eFoodsDirect.
[31:04.080 --> 31:09.000]  Right now we have a huge number of Americans that are in serious trouble, right smack dab
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.400]  in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters.
[31:11.400 --> 31:16.040]  I know that thousands of you like us are frustrated with not being able to help those
[31:16.040 --> 31:18.920]  who have lost so much and are in so much pain.
[31:18.920 --> 31:21.040]  We can't stand idly by.
[31:21.040 --> 31:24.960]  Food is the best way to help the victims and support the relief effort.
[31:24.960 --> 31:29.160]  We have a plan for any of you who would like to partner with us in providing food in this
[31:29.160 --> 31:30.840]  desperate time of need.
[31:30.840 --> 31:36.160]  We've built a seven day emergency food package containing breakfast, lunch and dinner for
[31:36.160 --> 31:40.240]  a whole week for one adult, valued at $60.
[31:40.240 --> 31:45.120]  Over $25 will ship this life saving supply directly to those in need.
[31:45.120 --> 31:55.560]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com that's 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[31:55.560 --> 31:58.520]  The food is contributed at considerably less than cost.
[31:58.520 --> 32:01.000]  Thank you.
[32:01.000 --> 32:05.680]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[32:05.680 --> 32:07.720]  immunity and health.
[32:07.720 --> 32:12.320]  Like silver lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of
[32:12.320 --> 32:14.480]  silver based products.
[32:14.480 --> 32:19.840]  Our most popular silver based products are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions, our two
[32:19.840 --> 32:25.600]  ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all natural silver soaps.
[32:25.600 --> 32:29.600]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[32:29.600 --> 32:34.240]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and
[32:34.240 --> 32:36.560]  leave the silver at the surface.
[32:36.560 --> 32:41.040]  Even rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[32:41.040 --> 32:46.200]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more
[32:46.200 --> 32:47.720]  effectively.

[32:54.480 --> 32:56.640]  are best for you.
[32:56.640 --> 33:04.040]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[33:04.040 --> 33:09.000]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run.
[33:09.000 --> 33:18.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[33:18.440 --> 33:19.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[33:19.840 --> 33:21.520]  I'm David Knight, standing in for Alex.
[33:21.520 --> 33:25.800]  He'll be joining us in a few minutes live from London where he's covering the Bilderberg
[33:25.800 --> 33:26.800]  conference.
[33:26.800 --> 33:31.480]  Yes, we're going where the mainstream media is afraid to go, at least the mainstream
[33:31.480 --> 33:32.480]  media in the U.S.
[33:32.480 --> 33:41.320]  And we were talking earlier about this leak of court order from the secret court order
[33:41.320 --> 33:47.800]  that was kept under lock and key, classified, giving authorization to seize phone records
[33:47.800 --> 33:52.080]  of all, all of Verizon's customers.
[33:52.080 --> 33:54.440]  And Breitbart has an interesting take on this.
[33:54.440 --> 34:00.360]  He says the mainstream media has failed to break even one of the four Obama scandals.
[34:00.360 --> 34:04.240]  He says, well, if it's Thursday, there's going to be a new Obama scandal.
[34:04.240 --> 34:09.400]  But he says, okay, look at over the past four weeks, four major scandals have broken over
[34:09.400 --> 34:11.360]  the Obama administration.
[34:11.360 --> 34:17.920]  And it's a very sad and frightening truth that our pathetic American lapdog mainstream
[34:17.920 --> 34:21.360]  media is not responsible for breaking even a single one.
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.360]  That's Breitbart writing this.
[34:23.360 --> 34:24.360]  Verizon?
[34:24.360 --> 34:25.360]  Nope.
[34:25.360 --> 34:26.360]  That wasn't our guys.
[34:26.360 --> 34:27.880]  That was the Brits at the Guardian.
[34:27.880 --> 34:28.880]  The IRS?
[34:28.880 --> 34:29.880]  No.
[34:29.880 --> 34:34.040]  The IRS broke their own scandal with a planted question.
[34:34.040 --> 34:37.640]  The Justice Department's seizure of AP phone records?
[34:37.640 --> 34:38.640]  No.
[34:38.640 --> 34:39.640]  That wasn't us.
[34:39.640 --> 34:44.040]  Believe it or not, the Associated Press didn't even break the story about the Associated
[34:44.040 --> 34:47.080]  Press being spied on by the U.S. government.
[34:47.080 --> 34:52.520]  Like the IRS, we only found out about it because the Justice Department outed itself.
[34:52.520 --> 34:54.360]  And then he says, Benghazi, are you kidding?
[34:54.360 --> 34:59.800]  With a couple of rare exceptions, Jake Tapper, Cheryl Ackerson, the media has spent the last
[34:59.800 --> 35:05.960]  eight months attacking those who reported it, Congress and Fox News, instead of seeking
[35:05.960 --> 35:06.960]  the truth.
[35:06.960 --> 35:08.400]  Yeah, that's welcome to the club.
[35:08.400 --> 35:11.640]  I mean, that's what's been happening at InfoWars for years.
[35:11.640 --> 35:17.800]  Alex has been attacked by the very media that ignores the breaking stories.
[35:17.800 --> 35:23.280]  And you'll see that at Bilderberg, there are the owners of the mainstream media.
[35:23.280 --> 35:27.160]  The Washington Post is there, the owner, but you're not going to see Washington Post
[35:27.160 --> 35:28.960]  coverage of Bilderberg.
[35:28.960 --> 35:33.480]  You do see it, however, breaking in London in the British newspapers.
[35:33.480 --> 35:35.720]  We've got a headline here from the London Evening Standard.
[35:35.720 --> 35:40.680]  It says, no minutes, no press conferences, just the world's power brokers chewing the
[35:40.680 --> 35:42.800]  fat on the issues of the day.
[35:42.800 --> 35:46.160]  It's a Bilderberg conference, and it's coming to a suburb near you.
[35:46.160 --> 35:47.160]  That's right.
[35:47.160 --> 35:49.480]  If you live in London, it's coming to your suburb, and it's going to be something that's
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.680]  going to be pretty awful.
[35:53.680 --> 35:58.920]  We've also got a headline here from Telegraph, another British paper, says, Bilderberg grew
[35:58.920 --> 35:59.920]  up.
[35:59.920 --> 36:04.200]  No conspiracy, just the most influential group in the world.
[36:04.200 --> 36:06.800]  Conspiracy theorists, it's not a theory.
[36:06.800 --> 36:07.800]  They're there.
[36:07.800 --> 36:09.080]  We're taking pictures of them.
[36:09.080 --> 36:13.440]  They're shutting down an entire section of London here, and it's not a theory.
[36:13.440 --> 36:16.120]  Claim that it is a shadow world government.
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.400]  Former leading members tell the Telegraph it was the most useful meeting they ever went
[36:20.400 --> 36:23.960]  to, and it was crucial in forming the European Union.
[36:23.960 --> 36:25.600]  Oh, OK.
[36:25.600 --> 36:30.920]  So if it's crucial in forming the European Union, then is it a conspiracy theory that
[36:30.920 --> 36:32.680]  it's a shadow government?
[36:32.680 --> 36:33.680]  No.
[36:33.680 --> 36:38.520]  But today, the Bilderberg group is meeting in Britain, and that's the headlines from
[36:38.520 --> 36:40.880]  the Telegraph.
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.640]  Now I've got a special report here from John Bowne, but before we go to it, I want to talk
[36:45.640 --> 36:50.800]  about a couple of things that will help you and will help us to pay the bills for when
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.040]  we do things like cover Bilderberg in London with staff there.
[36:55.040 --> 36:59.680]  If you go to InfowarsStore.com, you'll see there the survival seed vault.
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.560]  Now one of the things that's really key about this is the fact that these are heirloom seeds.
[37:05.560 --> 37:11.840]  Now there's a big difference between selective breeding of seeds and GMO, and if you've been
[37:11.840 --> 37:16.760]  following the news from us and maybe even some other alternative outlets, you're going
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.040]  to hear about the Monsanto court cases.
[37:20.040 --> 37:25.520]  You're going to see that foreign countries have been turning back our wheat supply.
[37:25.520 --> 37:28.480]  They're concerned about contamination of the food supply.
[37:28.480 --> 37:29.560]  Why?
[37:29.560 --> 37:30.560]  Because of GMO.
[37:30.560 --> 37:34.320]  GMO is very, very different from selective breeding.
[37:34.320 --> 37:41.840]  With GMO, they can mix in pesticide into the genetic makeup of this food.
[37:41.840 --> 37:45.360]  They can mix in animal parts into this food.
[37:45.360 --> 37:48.160]  They can do stuff trans species.
[37:48.160 --> 37:51.120]  So it isn't just that they're refining it through selective breeding.
[37:51.120 --> 37:54.520]  That's what farmers have done for generations, and that's what you're getting with an heirloom
[37:54.520 --> 37:55.520]  seed.
[37:55.520 --> 38:01.280]  You're getting something that people have bred for taste, for health.
[38:01.280 --> 38:04.800]  Sometimes the grocery stores have bred their food for appearance.
[38:04.800 --> 38:08.840]  I remember going to Orlando and eating at a restaurant and they brought out a salad that
[38:08.840 --> 38:12.080]  had heirloom tomatoes, and it's the first time I've had experience with that.
[38:12.080 --> 38:14.280]  They look absolutely horrible.
[38:14.280 --> 38:16.680]  Some of the ugliest looking tomatoes I've ever seen.
[38:16.680 --> 38:19.320]  One of the best tomatoes I've ever tasted.
[38:19.320 --> 38:21.040]  That's what you get with heirloom seeds.
[38:21.040 --> 38:25.120]  You get that and you get stuff that's not contaminated with GMO, and that's a concern
[38:25.120 --> 38:30.400]  because even though our Supreme Court unanimously said that Monsanto can do anything they want
[38:30.400 --> 38:33.840]  to in our country, of course they're barred in other countries, even though they can do
[38:33.840 --> 38:37.800]  anything they want to in this country, one of the things that we've got to worry about,
[38:37.800 --> 38:42.720]  which is what we just saw with wheat, is contamination, cross-pollinization.
[38:42.720 --> 38:49.960]  These seeds are sealed in packets and they are kept as heirloom seeds, so it's something
[38:49.960 --> 38:51.280]  you don't have to worry about.
[38:51.280 --> 38:56.560]  This is genetically clean food, so take a look at that at InfowarsStore.com.
[38:56.560 --> 39:03.920]  Also we have a ProPure Gravity Filter special, 15% off through Bilderberg.
[39:03.920 --> 39:09.560]  That's something that we've got a new technology filter that ProPure has come out with, a single
[39:09.560 --> 39:17.200]  filter that can remove hydrofluorosilic acid, which is the most common way that our water
[39:17.200 --> 39:21.360]  supply is polluted with fluoride.
[39:21.360 --> 39:26.800]  They can get that out with that gravity feed filter and unlike reverse osmosis or distillation,
[39:26.800 --> 39:31.840]  ProPure filters do not eliminate the beneficial minerals that are naturally found in water.
[39:31.840 --> 39:32.840]  So check out those two.
[39:32.840 --> 39:39.240]  You're going to get 15% off of ProPure filters through Bilderberg, so a special going on right
[39:39.240 --> 39:41.520]  there that will help us to pay for the trip to Bilderberg.
[39:41.520 --> 39:47.560]  There's a lot of expenses involved in covering the news and we don't get massive subsidies
[39:47.560 --> 39:51.080]  from the federal government like MSNBC and others do.
[39:51.080 --> 39:54.200]  Well, let's go to that report now from John Bound.
[39:54.200 --> 39:57.920]  It's how Bilderberg grew to prominence.
[39:57.920 --> 40:17.680]  Welcome to Bilderberg Exposed, Evolution by Stealth.
[40:17.680 --> 40:23.880]  In order to fundamentally understand Bilderberg, we must look at the origin and influence of
[40:23.880 --> 40:25.280]  the CFR.
[40:25.280 --> 40:31.760]  The Council on Foreign Relations was founded after World War I when Woodrow Wilson tasked
[40:31.760 --> 40:38.400]  his advisor Edward House to create a fellowship of 150 scholars to formulate a new foreign
[40:38.400 --> 40:40.160]  policy strategy.
[40:40.160 --> 40:45.920]  From the very beginning, the CFR was committed to a one-world government based on a centralized
[40:45.920 --> 40:48.400]  global financial system.
[40:48.400 --> 40:53.800]  A global Congress would need to be assembled, so by invitation only, leaders of the world
[40:53.800 --> 41:01.160]  and industry, politics, media, and royalty were brought in to discuss an extreme secrecy
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.920]  planning related to global domination by the selected elite.
[41:05.920 --> 41:12.320]  The objectives of the Bilderberg group include one set of universal values, control of world
[41:12.320 --> 41:18.960]  public opinion by mind control, an end to the middle class, only rulers and servants,
[41:18.960 --> 41:26.520]  a zero-growth society, order out of chaos and perpetual wars, total control of education
[41:26.520 --> 41:32.720]  to program the public mind as a servant class, centralized control of all foreign and domestic
[41:32.720 --> 41:40.560]  policies, impose a UN tax on world citizens, expanding NAFTA in the World Trade Organization
[41:40.560 --> 41:45.400]  globally, and expansion of NATO as a world military.
[41:45.400 --> 41:51.480]  In the 1960s, the attendees included Prince Philip, Paul-Henry Spock, former Secretary
[41:51.480 --> 41:57.120]  General of NATO, former Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, former Secretary of the New Department
[41:57.120 --> 42:04.480]  of Economic Affairs Eric Rohl, former President Gerald Ford, former U.S. Secretary of State
[42:04.480 --> 42:10.600]  Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter, and special assistant
[42:10.600 --> 42:13.440]  to the President Charles Douglas Jackson.
[42:13.440 --> 42:19.080]  The final names are especially important, as they boldly violated the Logan Act, a
[42:19.080 --> 42:25.680]  U.S. federal law that forbids unauthorized citizens from negotiating with foreign governments.
[42:25.680 --> 42:30.960]  Violation of the Logan Act is a felony, punishable under federal law with imprisonment of up
[42:30.960 --> 42:32.760]  to three years.
[42:32.760 --> 42:38.640]  For more information regarding Bilderberg, please visit infowarstore.com and pick up
[42:38.640 --> 42:42.720]  Daniel Estuland's excellent work, The Octopus Deception.
[42:42.720 --> 42:47.040]  Please join us tomorrow when we examine how the Bilderberg Group manufactured the United
[42:47.040 --> 42:53.600]  States Presidents in the 1970s, and how these commanders-in-chief conspired with foreign
[42:53.600 --> 43:00.040]  entities illegally to forward the goals of a new world order as the elitist Bilderberg
[43:00.040 --> 43:02.840]  agenda evolves by stealth.
[43:02.840 --> 43:06.200]  This is John Bowne with the Info Wars Nightly News.
[43:06.200 --> 43:09.000]  A great report from John Bowne.
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.200]  Now we've got a background. Listen to how you just heard how John Bowne described it.
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.720]  He talks about the Logan Act, talks about how that's illegal, talks about the pandering
[43:17.720 --> 43:19.220]  of influence.
[43:19.220 --> 43:23.040]  Now this is the way mainstream media, even in Britain, of course, they're covering it
[43:23.040 --> 43:24.040]  for the first time there.
[43:24.040 --> 43:26.000]  It's kind of hard for them to ignore it in London.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.760]  It's having a pretty big impact there.
[43:28.760 --> 43:34.360]  So the telegraph is covering it, but they're doing what we probably expect the BBC is going
[43:34.360 --> 43:39.720]  to do, and that is basically explain it away, move along, there's nothing to see here.
[43:39.720 --> 43:42.040]  Here's how they give the history of Bilderberg.
[43:42.040 --> 43:46.200]  They say Bilderberg was founded in 1954 to bring the leaders of Western Europe and the
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.720]  United States closer as the Soviet Union cemented its control of the Eastern Bloc.
[43:50.720 --> 43:53.560]  See, that was, it's all about defense.
[43:53.560 --> 43:58.040]  We've already heard other people say it was to bring us peace.
[43:58.040 --> 44:03.240]  Well, we've had nothing but 60 years of war since the end of World War II.
[44:03.240 --> 44:08.360]  We've had continuous warfare, it's been to nobody's benefit, nobody's benefit, except
[44:08.360 --> 44:13.640]  the military industrial complex, which is very, very well represented at Bilderberg.
[44:13.640 --> 44:20.440]  If you look at it, most of the attendees fall into either banks, politicians, industrial
[44:20.440 --> 44:23.480]  military complex, and big oil companies.
[44:23.480 --> 44:25.280]  That's what you see at Bilderberg by and large.
[44:25.280 --> 44:30.520]  And of course, mainstream media owners, not reporters, are there.
[44:30.520 --> 44:31.840]  They continue on in the telegraph.
[44:31.840 --> 44:36.320]  They say they first met at Bilderberg Hotel, that's where they get the name, near Arnhem
[44:36.320 --> 44:41.800]  at the instigation of Joseph Rettinger, a Polish polio victim who had fought the Nazis
[44:41.800 --> 44:43.720]  during the war.
[44:43.720 --> 44:46.920]  Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands was a chair in that first meeting.
[44:46.920 --> 44:47.920]  Oh, wait a minute.
[44:47.920 --> 44:51.880]  They didn't mention the fact that Prince Bernhard didn't fight the Nazis.
[44:51.880 --> 44:54.600]  Prince Bernhard was a Nazi.
[44:54.600 --> 45:00.480]  He was also involved in Lockheed Martin scandals of the 1970s.
[45:00.480 --> 45:01.720]  Influence peddling.
[45:01.720 --> 45:06.720]  You wouldn't expect that that would happen when a lot of people get together in secret
[45:06.720 --> 45:10.880]  at Bilderberg with politicians, a lot of big, powerful, most powerful companies in the world
[45:10.880 --> 45:13.040]  to get together with the most powerful politicians in the world.
[45:13.040 --> 45:16.880]  You wouldn't expect there to be any corruption there, would you?
[45:16.880 --> 45:18.880]  Come on, really, seriously.
[45:18.880 --> 45:22.280]  In that first meeting, the participants included bankers, economists, and the future labor
[45:22.280 --> 45:24.480]  leader Hugh Gateskill.
[45:24.480 --> 45:28.880]  And they debated the communist threat and the prospect of European integration.
[45:28.880 --> 45:32.960]  They didn't just debate the prospect of European immigration.
[45:32.960 --> 45:33.960]  They planned it.
[45:33.960 --> 45:35.240]  They coordinated it.
[45:35.240 --> 45:36.240]  They conspired.
[45:36.240 --> 45:38.760]  You know where that word comes from?
[45:38.760 --> 45:39.760]  Conspire.
[45:39.760 --> 45:40.760]  It's interesting.
[45:40.760 --> 45:42.080]  It's breathe together.
[45:42.080 --> 45:43.080]  Breathe together.
[45:43.080 --> 45:44.360]  That's what these guys were doing.
[45:44.360 --> 45:48.600]  They were breathing together to create the Euro and the European Union.
[45:48.600 --> 45:50.600]  How's that working out?
[45:50.600 --> 45:58.840]  What we see there is we see Goldman Sachs executives put in charge of companies imposing
[45:58.840 --> 46:03.680]  spending limits on them, telling them how to run their country, whether you agree with
[46:03.680 --> 46:08.760]  it or not, telling them how to run their country, and deposing democratically elected leaders.
[46:08.760 --> 46:12.200]  Now, it goes on, and I want to read this here.
[46:12.200 --> 46:17.120]  But while this is the telegraph, while they wrinkle at the conspiracy theorists, former
[46:17.120 --> 46:21.880]  leaders of the Bilderberg conferences say they were the most important events they ever went
[46:21.880 --> 46:22.880]  to.
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.560]  Okay, so how can you say, move along, it's nothing to see here.
[46:27.560 --> 46:30.960]  We're just getting together, and yet you say they are the most important events we ever
[46:30.960 --> 46:32.040]  went to.
[46:32.040 --> 46:35.520]  And yet we're not allowed to see any minutes or any notes.
[46:35.520 --> 46:40.000]  We're not even allowed to know who goes there, because although they have now in the last
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.960]  couple of years released an official attendee list, and this year for the first time I believe
[46:45.960 --> 46:52.440]  they listed an agenda, we don't know if that's the agenda that they're talking about.
[46:52.440 --> 46:55.480]  And we don't know if there are other people at that meeting.
[46:55.480 --> 46:56.760]  That was what Alex was talking about.
[46:56.760 --> 46:59.160]  That's why they're, why do you think they're blacking out the cars?
[46:59.160 --> 47:03.120]  I mean, if they've told us that Henry Kissinger is going to be there, does Henry Kissinger
[47:03.120 --> 47:06.760]  really need to come into a black limo?
[47:06.760 --> 47:11.080]  Only if they're sneaking people in the back door, and we've been told in the past that
[47:11.080 --> 47:16.080]  we had presidential candidates that were brought in in the back, that were being groomed for
[47:16.080 --> 47:22.560]  leadership positions, and they finish up and they say this, it is above all a club for life's
[47:22.560 --> 47:24.280]  winners.
[47:24.280 --> 47:30.480]  George Osborne, Ed Balls, and Ken Clark, the cabinet minister who also serves on the group's
[47:30.480 --> 47:33.160]  steering committee will arrive this afternoon.
[47:33.160 --> 47:40.120]  Well, life's winners, George Osborne and Ed Balls are the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
[47:40.120 --> 47:43.080]  and the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.
[47:43.080 --> 47:51.440]  This would be like the Treasury Department showing up, and the Opposition Party's Treasury
[47:51.440 --> 47:52.640]  Department.
[47:52.640 --> 47:55.760]  This is all in the midst of a major scandal that's going on.
[47:55.760 --> 48:01.800]  We had in the last week, just at the end of last week, we had three members of the House
[48:01.800 --> 48:07.080]  of Lords have to step down because of a sting that was done by a newspaper there, showing
[48:07.080 --> 48:10.800]  them agreeing to take bribes to pedal influence.
[48:10.800 --> 48:17.040]  We have a fourth person who, just prior to that, was also involved in a journalism sting.
[48:17.040 --> 48:24.040]  So UK is in the midst of a massive corruption of influence scandal, and yet the Telegraph
[48:24.040 --> 48:26.920]  says this is just for life's winners.
[48:26.920 --> 48:28.920]  This is a club for life's winners.
[48:28.920 --> 48:29.920]  Don't worry about this.
[48:29.920 --> 48:31.240]  They're just having a good time.
[48:31.240 --> 48:32.720]  They're just playing golf.
[48:32.720 --> 48:37.680]  Maybe if we could get in there, we would really see that you've got Henry Kissinger dancing
[48:37.680 --> 48:40.200]  disco with David Petraeus, maybe.
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.560]  I don't know what's going on, but I'm sure it's nothing that we need to worry about.
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.400]  It's just one of the most important meetings that these world leaders say they've ever
[48:49.400 --> 48:50.400]  attended.
[48:50.400 --> 48:54.560]  But at the same time, we shouldn't really be bothering them because, after all, they're
[48:54.560 --> 48:58.720]  entitled to their privacy even though you and I aren't, even though they want to know
[48:58.720 --> 49:05.560]  every detail and facet of our life, measure us, track us, spy on us, record us.
[49:05.560 --> 49:10.240]  We're not even allowed to know who's in that building.
[49:10.240 --> 49:15.800]  Well, in other news, Lindsey Graham isn't sure if bloggers deserve First Amendment protection
[49:15.800 --> 49:17.920]  or not.
[49:17.920 --> 49:21.040]  I'm not sure if Lindsey Graham deserves to be a senator or not.
[49:21.040 --> 49:24.560]  I think what we ought to do is, I think the alternative media, I think bloggers need to
[49:24.560 --> 49:28.880]  get busy and make Lindsey Graham their pet project.
[49:28.880 --> 49:32.720]  I think they need to make sure that this guy does not get back to the Senate.
[49:32.720 --> 49:37.680]  He's coming up for a reelection this next time, and if there's any senator who has been
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.480]  on the wrong side of every issue, it's Lindsey Graham.
[49:42.480 --> 49:48.000]  Always on the side of war, always on the side of spying on citizens, always on the side
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.600]  of taking people's constitutionally guaranteed rights.
[49:51.600 --> 49:57.600]  You know, those rights aren't our rights just because the Constitution says that they are.
[49:57.600 --> 50:00.120]  There are rights because we're human beings.
[50:00.120 --> 50:05.040]  Those rights come to us from God as human beings, they're basic fundamental rights that
[50:05.040 --> 50:08.560]  all human beings, whether they're American citizens, are not in joy.
[50:08.560 --> 50:12.480]  That's why when you allow the government to trample the rights of foreigners in other
[50:12.480 --> 50:17.160]  countries, it's just a matter of time before they trample your rights in this country.
[50:17.160 --> 50:22.000]  Because if they can disrespect other people, have no respect for people as human beings
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.840]  in other countries, they're not going to have any respect for you as a human being in this
[50:24.840 --> 50:26.320]  country either.
[50:26.320 --> 50:29.680]  And we're seeing that happening now in spades.
[50:29.680 --> 50:33.120]  We need to make sure that people like Lindsey Graham don't return.
[50:33.120 --> 50:38.880]  We need to get more senators like Ted Cruz, like Rand Paul, and then and only then are
[50:38.880 --> 50:43.600]  we going to be able to do some things like shut down this Utah data center and send some
[50:43.600 --> 50:45.160]  people to jail.
[50:45.160 --> 50:46.660]  It's about time.
[50:46.660 --> 50:49.520]  Hang on, we'll be right back after the break.
[50:49.520 --> 50:51.800]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us very quickly.

[52:04.000 --> 52:05.000]  Box.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.960]  I want you to know some very important information.
[52:07.960 --> 52:12.760]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[52:12.760 --> 52:16.960]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[52:16.960 --> 52:22.640]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[54:20.120 --> 54:21.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[54:21.520 --> 54:25.640]  I'm David Knight standing in for Alex, and if you're watching the broadcast there, you
[54:25.640 --> 54:30.400]  see we've got some live youth stream that is coming in right now from Bilderberg.
[54:30.400 --> 54:34.240]  Alex is there with other staff and crew, and they'll be joining us shortly.
[54:34.240 --> 54:37.040]  We'll have some live update reports from that.
[54:37.040 --> 54:43.240]  We were talking just before the break about Lindsey Graham, and I want to say that it's
[54:43.240 --> 54:47.800]  not just...let's talk about what he says about bloggers and whether or not they deserve
[54:47.800 --> 54:49.760]  First Amendment protection.
[54:49.760 --> 54:53.960]  He said, who is a journalist is the question that we need to ask ourselves, this is Lindsey
[54:53.960 --> 54:54.960]  Graham.
[54:54.960 --> 54:57.680]  He says, is any blogger out there saying anything?
[54:57.680 --> 54:59.800]  Are they saying anything?
[54:59.800 --> 55:03.000]  Do they deserve First Amendment protection?
[55:03.000 --> 55:04.720]  These are the issues of our times.
[55:04.720 --> 55:06.920]  Yeah, they are the issues of our times.
[55:06.920 --> 55:12.120]  They're the issue of our fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Constitution.
[55:12.120 --> 55:16.720]  The same Constitution Lindsey Graham swore to uphold and defend that he now tries to
[55:16.720 --> 55:19.000]  destroy at every turn.
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.880]  And of course, in this picture from the National Journal, guess who is right there by his side,
[55:23.880 --> 55:25.400]  blur it out in the background.
[55:25.400 --> 55:26.400]  It's John McCain.
[55:26.400 --> 55:27.720]  Yep, John McCain.
[55:27.720 --> 55:33.720]  The other person who is always on the side of war and espionage against Americans.
[55:33.720 --> 55:36.840]  And let's understand too that there is a war going on against Americans.
[55:36.840 --> 55:45.240]  The war of terror is a war of terror on American citizens, just like the war on drugs is actually
[55:45.240 --> 55:50.440]  a war of drugs conducted on American citizens.
[55:50.440 --> 55:53.400]  Imprisoning us at a rate that is higher than any other country.
[55:53.400 --> 55:59.160]  We have more prisoners, people imprisoned from the war on drugs primarily than even
[55:59.160 --> 56:00.200]  China does.
[56:00.200 --> 56:06.400]  And China has a far larger population and has authoritarian communist leaders, but we have
[56:06.400 --> 56:12.240]  a war of drugs because it's not just throwing people in jail at an alarming rate.
[56:12.240 --> 56:19.160]  It's also the fact that we went into Afghanistan and the Taliban had reduced the drug production
[56:19.160 --> 56:21.840]  there for poppy-based drugs like heroin and cocaine.
[56:21.840 --> 56:23.920]  They had reduced that to 10% of the world's supply.
[56:23.920 --> 56:27.960]  It had been one of the leading areas of the supply of drugs and that's one of the reasons
[56:27.960 --> 56:32.120]  we had to get the Taliban out of there because we needed to get that drug flow going again.
[56:32.120 --> 56:36.200]  That's one of the major ways the CIA funds itself is with illegal drugs.
[56:36.200 --> 56:42.920]  So we had Petraeus go in there and after American presence there, after we threw the Taliban
[56:42.920 --> 56:48.000]  out, we went from 10% to 90% of the world's supply coming from Afghanistan.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.400]  Looks like we've got some more footage there that's streaming live.
[56:50.400 --> 56:54.120]  Do we have Alex and crew there coming in live, guys?
[56:54.120 --> 56:58.400]  Okay, we don't have any audio yet, but it looks like they're panning around there.
[56:58.400 --> 57:01.440]  We can see there's a lot of people starting to gather.
[57:01.440 --> 57:06.440]  This is actually the first day of Bilderberg, they have been doing preparations up to this
[57:06.440 --> 57:07.440]  point.
[57:07.440 --> 57:14.200]  They blocked off the hotel from Tuesday on just so they could, I guess, get the place
[57:14.200 --> 57:15.200]  disinfected.
[57:15.200 --> 57:18.080]  You know, I can imagine they're going around these little things, they put on the toilet
[57:18.080 --> 57:22.200]  seat lids for Henry Kissinger and company so that they know that they've disinfected
[57:22.200 --> 57:25.920]  the whole place from all those rabble that would normally go in there and spend several
[57:25.920 --> 57:28.440]  thousand dollars a night to stay in that hotel.
[57:28.440 --> 57:33.920]  They're going to get the place cleaned up and debugged in every sense of the word.
[57:33.920 --> 57:38.680]  So we're going to be joining them before too much longer.
[57:38.680 --> 57:45.840]  But again, we were talking about Lindsey Graham and deciding who and who is not a journalist.
[57:45.840 --> 57:51.440]  Now understand that the First Amendment does specifically mention the press, but it is
[57:51.440 --> 57:54.440]  not just the press that has free speech.
[57:54.440 --> 57:59.160]  Every American has free speech and every American has freedom of religion.
[57:59.160 --> 58:03.360]  It's not just churches or church leaders who have freedom of religion.
[58:03.360 --> 58:05.320]  It's every single person.
[58:05.320 --> 58:10.240]  And I misplaced the article here somewhere, but there is a, just breaking in the last
[58:10.240 --> 58:16.800]  couple of days, there was a fellow who was a valedictorian and he was prohibited from
[58:16.800 --> 58:20.000]  making any statements about his Christian belief and they stopped the prayer.
[58:20.000 --> 58:25.040]  When he got up to make his speech, he tore up his approved speech and said what he wanted
[58:25.040 --> 58:26.040]  to.
[58:26.040 --> 58:27.040]  That's what we all have to do.
[58:27.040 --> 58:29.040]  That's the spirit that we need from bloggers.
[58:29.040 --> 58:30.040]  Stay tuned.
[58:30.040 --> 58:50.880]  We'll be back with Alex from Bilderberg in London right after the break.
[58:50.880 --> 58:56.640]  Now is the perfect time to spring clean your body with supernatural silver, a non-toxic
[58:56.640 --> 59:00.920]  disinfectant for the body that can be used internally or externally.

[59:10.960 --> 59:15.440]  the immune system to refocus its energy and recharge.

[59:53.560 --> 1:00:05.360]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:10.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.120 --> 1:00:11.120]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:13.280]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:17.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:24.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:25.360]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:27.800]  I'm David Knight, building in for Alex.
[1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:31.040]  Alex is in London, confronting Big Brother.
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:33.760]  Going places of mainstream media will not go.
[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:39.400]  And we have, there's a six hour difference between the time here in Austin and the time
[1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:40.400]  in London.
[1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:46.600]  So, he's been out at Bilderberg today, bullhorning and speaking and doing quite a bit of work
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:47.600]  earlier.
[1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:52.000]  And we've got a video that was uploaded live from there that we're going to cut to in
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  just a second.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.960]  Alex is on his way back to the hotel where he's going to come in and start doing the
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:00:58.960]  show in just a few minutes.
[1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:00.280]  Let's go to that cut right now.
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:05.480]  Mainly the media moguls and people like Peter Field are openly debating on the real agenda
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:08.960]  this year, going public and having real transparency.
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:14.120]  And so, I tell you now, it's time for you to speak to the press and it's time for you
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:18.880]  to be honest about the things you've done before more of you get indicted like you did
[1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:22.680]  back in the 70s with the Lockheed Martin's scandal.
[1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:26.880]  So know this, we're aware of your lobbying, we're aware of you behind the closed doors
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:31.360]  trying to get your fingers into the government stream of money.
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:36.200]  And we are here to point out that this is going on and it's outrageous that many of
[1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:42.040]  you are worth 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 billion dollars in attendance and that you would make the
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:47.120]  taxpayers fit most of the bill for the iron fence that you've demanded that be built
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:49.120]  around the compound that you're meeting.
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:56.760]  It is disgusting and it's nothing but an exclamation point illustrating how we pay for your whole
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:02:07.320]  life and your whole world and most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites.
[1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:16.000]  And for my children in the future in the North American Union, the Bush signed back in 2005
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  in secret but that got leaked with the European Union.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.160]  Those transatlantic bills are already being made.
[1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:28.040]  We know that's their plan to remove local control from the county, city, state, federal
[1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:29.040]  level.
[1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:30.480]  I want my U.S. government back.
[1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:36.320]  I don't want my representatives being puppets bought off in the dark behind steel fences.
[1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:45.800]  I want the criminal lobbying to stop now and I want a future for my children.
[1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:49.200]  What would you like to be doing in five years' time or ten years' time?
[1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:55.800]  In five years' time, I would like to be basically off the air and I'd like to be there on.
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:02:59.320]  No, I'd like to be a farmer on our family farm.
[1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:02.800]  That's what I would like to do and I would like to see the globalist fall like the old
[1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:07.240]  Soviet Union, I'd like to see most of them after a trial, obviously we sent to prison
[1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:12.720]  for the crime against humanity that they've committed and I would like to basically hand
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:17.400]  over the reins of my media operation to some of my crew to continue to muckrake but if
[1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:20.240]  we weren't in such dire straits, I would not be broadcasting seven or eight hours.
[1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:21.520]  We're going to continue with that.
[1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:26.400]  We've got Alex coming up in just a few minutes and we've got a lot of people who don't carry
[1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:31.280]  the first five minutes of the hour so we're going to come back and play the rest of that
[1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:36.120]  in the next segment but if you don't think that it's making a difference, take a look
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:37.240]  at the crowd that's there.
[1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:42.920]  This is a meeting that didn't exist ten years ago in most people's minds and it's something
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:47.920]  that the mainstream American press is still not covering but it's getting a lot of press
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:52.120]  everywhere else and a lot of people are becoming very aware of what's going on there primarily
[1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:57.640]  because of people like Alex, Drudge has carried our reports, we've also got a lot of help
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:04:03.520]  from the Guardian in the UK and if you don't think that things are changing, take a look
[1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:04.520]  at this.
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:09.280]  We now have House voting to delay bulk ammunition purchases by the DHS.
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:10.520]  This is coming from the Hill.
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:14.320]  It says the House late Wednesday voted to stop the Department of Homeland Security from
[1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:18.040]  entering into new contracts to buy millions of rounds of ammunition until the Department
[1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:24.120]  of Homeland Security reports to Congress on the need for ammo and its cost.
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:28.960]  Now understand that this is something that just as recently as a couple of weeks ago,
[1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:36.760]  we were still being criticized by National Review and Rachel Maddow for this saying that
[1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:41.360]  it doesn't exist, that it's a figment of our imagination, that it's a conspiracy theory
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:45.880]  even though we linked to the actual RFPs from DHS.
[1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:48.720]  So now we see some actual action being taken.
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:05:01.160]  Stay tuned, we'll be right back with more from Alex and Goldberg, stay tuned.
[1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:06.720]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms but if you don't have a home security system
[1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:10.640]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:14.560]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:20.520]  Check out SimpliSafe, it's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:04.240]  Hi, I'm Steve Shank, founder of eFoodsDirect.
[1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:09.160]  Right now we have a huge number of Americans that are in serious trouble, right smack dab
[1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:11.560]  in the middle of the Oklahoma disasters.
[1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:16.200]  I know that thousands of you, like us, are frustrated with not being able to help those
[1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:19.040]  who have lost so much and are in so much pain.

[1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:10.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:11.320]  You want answers?
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:17.660]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:17.660 --> 1:08:21.620]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:26.420]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:08:26.420 --> 1:08:28.460]  I'm David Knife, coming in for Alex.
[1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:35.060]  Alex is going to be joining us at about another 10, 15 minutes and he's going to be joined
[1:08:35.060 --> 1:08:37.940]  live at his hotel room with Max Kizer.
[1:08:37.940 --> 1:08:39.980]  So that's going to be an interesting segment.
[1:08:39.980 --> 1:08:43.820]  I'm sure they're going to have a lot to talk about, not just Bilderberg but a lot of economic
[1:08:43.820 --> 1:08:44.820]  issues as well.
[1:08:44.820 --> 1:08:47.300]  And you know it's not just the economic issues.
[1:08:47.300 --> 1:08:53.900]  We see what Bilderberg has been planning since at least their second meeting in 1955.
[1:08:53.900 --> 1:09:00.420]  And that is the European Union and the EU and the economic disaster that that has created
[1:09:00.420 --> 1:09:03.180]  for the European people.
[1:09:03.180 --> 1:09:11.500]  And the way they've been able to put in their own bankers in charge of duly elected democratic
[1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:12.500]  leadership.
[1:09:12.500 --> 1:09:17.500]  So they're destroying national sovereignty, they're destroying the economies of Europe.
[1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:21.060]  And so it's working out just fine for the Bilderberg people but it's not working out
[1:09:21.060 --> 1:09:24.500]  too well for the peoples of Europe and it's not going to work out too well for the rest
[1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:25.500]  of humanity.
[1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:30.340]  Now, if you've seen the pictures of when we've been covering the Grove Hotel, you've
[1:09:30.340 --> 1:09:37.060]  seen this statue that they've got of a kind of a half human, half robot, the flesh is
[1:09:37.060 --> 1:09:40.500]  falling off of it as it's crawling on its hands and knees.
[1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:44.540]  You can't tell if it's going into the dust or if it's coming up and it's half human,
[1:09:44.540 --> 1:09:45.540]  half robot.
[1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:48.380]  Well, that is the singularity.
[1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:50.140]  They're actually putting out an artwork.
[1:09:50.140 --> 1:09:52.180]  They're telling us where they want to go.
[1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:58.420]  And this unification, there's a picture of it right now on the monitor, real creepy,
[1:09:58.420 --> 1:10:00.620]  real creepy statue.
[1:10:00.620 --> 1:10:03.140]  They're telling us where they want to take us.
[1:10:03.140 --> 1:10:04.340]  And they've been talking about it.
[1:10:04.340 --> 1:10:08.060]  They're openly talk about their plans just as they openly talked about the unification
[1:10:08.060 --> 1:10:12.500]  of Europe and openly talked about a world government and a new world order.
[1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:16.700]  People don't want to believe where these guys want to go.
[1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:19.540]  And it is kind of unbelievable, this singularity.
[1:10:19.540 --> 1:10:22.340]  Frankly, I don't believe they can pull it off.
[1:10:22.340 --> 1:10:23.340]  I'm a Christian.
[1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:26.620]  You're not going to convince me that they can transfer their soul, their consciousness
[1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:31.100]  into some kind of a machine, but they can kill a lot of people trying to do it.
[1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:32.980]  These are mad scientists.
[1:10:32.980 --> 1:10:35.820]  This is from Kurzweil's own website.
[1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:40.940]  This is Ray Kurzweil, and he is now the chief scientist for Google.
[1:10:40.940 --> 1:10:45.940]  And he is very much into the transhumanism whole thing.
[1:10:45.940 --> 1:10:47.660]  He's done documentaries on it.
[1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:49.580]  He has conferences about it.
[1:10:49.580 --> 1:10:51.500]  He is one of the major proponents of it.
[1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:55.700]  And now he is the chief scientist of Google.
[1:10:55.700 --> 1:11:00.500]  And in this column, he has people, he follows technology and he looks at different things
[1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:04.540]  that he thinks are moving in the way for moving in the direction that are going to allow him
[1:11:04.540 --> 1:11:10.100]  to merge with a machine and live forever and become some kind of a God who can travel to
[1:11:10.100 --> 1:11:12.620]  the distant stars and live forever.
[1:11:12.620 --> 1:11:17.180]  He believes that he's going to be able to bring back his father's consciousness somehow,
[1:11:17.180 --> 1:11:19.100]  his father who's now deceased.
[1:11:19.100 --> 1:11:23.740]  This guy is radically crazy, but he is a chief science officer for Google.
[1:11:23.740 --> 1:11:27.420]  And he has developed a lot of very impressive technology in the past.
[1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:33.300]  He's a very dangerous person, far more dangerous than someone, let's say, the unabomber.
[1:11:33.300 --> 1:11:34.900]  Now here's a question.
[1:11:34.900 --> 1:11:36.580]  This person says, how are you?
[1:11:36.580 --> 1:11:37.900]  My name is Noga.
[1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:40.860]  I'm a 16-year-old girl from Tel Aviv, Israel.
[1:11:40.860 --> 1:11:45.140]  First of all, I want to say I've read one of yours and it was fascinating.
[1:11:45.140 --> 1:11:46.660]  Secondly, I want to ask you a question.
[1:11:46.660 --> 1:11:48.180]  I'll start from the beginning.
[1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:53.820]  She wants to know about human rights and what the line is going to be between human rights
[1:11:53.820 --> 1:11:57.500]  and rights for robots as they gain consciousness.
[1:11:57.500 --> 1:12:01.220]  She says, as a huge science fiction fan, I chose the subject of human and robot rights
[1:12:01.220 --> 1:12:02.220]  in the future.
[1:12:02.220 --> 1:12:04.540]  I'm honored with a lot of questions still struggling with him.
[1:12:04.540 --> 1:12:08.420]  And I was hoping that you might be able to help me since you deal with robots and machines
[1:12:08.420 --> 1:12:09.420]  in the future.
[1:12:09.420 --> 1:12:11.420]  And he goes on about that for quite some time.
[1:12:11.420 --> 1:12:12.420]  She has a very long question.
[1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:15.300]  Now, here's what he has to say.
[1:12:15.300 --> 1:12:20.260]  He says, my view of the future is that we will merge with the machines.
[1:12:20.260 --> 1:12:24.620]  They are already extensions of ourselves, even if most of them are not yet in our bodies
[1:12:24.620 --> 1:12:26.420]  and brains.
[1:12:26.420 --> 1:12:31.100]  But technology is shrinking, and by the 2030s, intelligent machines will be the size of blood
[1:12:31.100 --> 1:12:32.860]  cells.
[1:12:32.860 --> 1:12:38.340]  And we will have millions of nanobots in our bloodstream augmenting our immune system.
[1:12:38.340 --> 1:12:42.740]  Oh, he's been talking to Bill Gates, I guess, about his new vaccine program.
[1:12:42.740 --> 1:12:47.380]  And going into our brain and extending our thinking into the cloud, the non-biological
[1:12:47.380 --> 1:12:53.700]  portion of our intelligence will rapidly expand exponentially so that by the 2040s, we will
[1:12:53.700 --> 1:12:57.340]  be almost entirely non-biological.
[1:12:57.340 --> 1:13:00.740]  So we will become the machines.
[1:13:00.740 --> 1:13:02.660]  That's what he imagines.
[1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:07.820]  And these are the same people who want to see the world's population reduced by anywhere
[1:13:07.820 --> 1:13:10.020]  from 90% to 99%.
[1:13:10.020 --> 1:13:14.300]  See, they want to be the ruling global elite.
[1:13:14.300 --> 1:13:17.300]  We're talking about the 1% or the 1% or the 1%.
[1:13:17.300 --> 1:13:21.220]  You know, the kind of people that are meeting at Bilderberg, the kind of people that have
[1:13:21.220 --> 1:13:24.460]  this eugenics agenda.
[1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:30.500]  And they openly proclaim it with things like that statue that's on its knees out there.
[1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:33.540]  I don't know what it's called, a Skeletor or something like that.
[1:13:33.540 --> 1:13:36.540]  It truly is a creepy skeleton.
[1:13:36.540 --> 1:13:40.540]  And we're joined now live by Alex and Max Kaiser in London.
[1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:41.540]  Hello, Alex.
[1:13:41.540 --> 1:13:45.900]  I'm not ready to go to him yet.
[1:13:45.900 --> 1:13:47.740]  Okay, he's not ready just yet.
[1:13:47.740 --> 1:13:49.420]  So he'll be with us in just a moment.
[1:13:49.420 --> 1:13:52.580]  They're still setting up some technical issues there.
[1:13:52.580 --> 1:14:00.340]  We also have in breaking news, the signing stage just began for the UN Arms Trade Treaty.
[1:14:00.340 --> 1:14:08.900]  Now, this is something that is set up to increase the government's scope and depth of registration.
[1:14:08.900 --> 1:14:11.100]  This is something that passed in the UN.
[1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:14.540]  It still has to be ratified in the United States.
[1:14:14.540 --> 1:14:15.980]  And there is some hope.
[1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:20.020]  This is an article from the New American, I believe.
[1:14:20.020 --> 1:14:21.020]  And yes, it is.
[1:14:21.020 --> 1:14:22.180]  It's the New American.
[1:14:22.180 --> 1:14:28.100]  And they're talking about the fact that there has been some pushback from some senators
[1:14:28.100 --> 1:14:33.380]  who are supporting our constitutional rights, our God-given rights, and they have put some
[1:14:33.380 --> 1:14:37.860]  language in that would effectively block this.
[1:14:37.860 --> 1:14:43.340]  But we also have to worry about the danger that it only takes two-thirds of the senators
[1:14:43.340 --> 1:14:46.140]  who are present to sign on to a treaty.
[1:14:46.140 --> 1:14:49.700]  It's not two-thirds of the senators, but two-thirds who are present.
[1:14:49.700 --> 1:14:56.340]  And they have until sometime in August, I believe, if I read the article correctly, before this
[1:14:56.340 --> 1:14:57.340]  expires.
[1:14:57.340 --> 1:15:00.300]  They don't have that long to sign on to it.
[1:15:00.300 --> 1:15:06.300]  So throughout the summer, we have to worry about Obama and other Democrats coming in
[1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:09.540]  and signing this under the cover of darkness.
[1:15:09.540 --> 1:15:12.700]  And we have some other information here from some other breaking news.
[1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:18.780]  We've got some classified documents talking about how CIA drone strikes often killed unknown
[1:15:18.780 --> 1:15:19.940]  people.
[1:15:19.940 --> 1:15:21.980]  This is from Russia today.
[1:15:21.980 --> 1:15:28.420]  And that's no new breaking news, but we do have some breaking news from Alex, so let's
[1:15:28.420 --> 1:15:29.940]  go to him right now.
[1:15:29.940 --> 1:15:30.940]  Oh, okay.
[1:15:30.940 --> 1:15:31.940]  I'm sorry.
[1:15:31.940 --> 1:15:33.940]  He's not ready just yet.
[1:15:33.940 --> 1:15:34.940]  Okay.
[1:15:34.940 --> 1:15:40.220]  It's not new that drone strikes have been killing unknown people, that they've been killing
[1:15:40.220 --> 1:15:41.860]  masses of people.
[1:15:41.860 --> 1:15:46.340]  And we now have a former drone operator say that he is haunted by his part in more than
[1:15:46.340 --> 1:15:48.660]  1,600 deaths.
[1:15:48.660 --> 1:15:52.060]  A former Air Force drone operator who says he participated in missions that killed more
[1:15:52.060 --> 1:15:57.660]  than 1,600 people remembers watching one of the first victims bleed to death.
[1:15:57.660 --> 1:16:02.260]  Brandon Bryant says he was sitting in a chair at an Nevada Air Force base operating the
[1:16:02.260 --> 1:16:06.500]  camera when his team fired two missiles from their drone at three men walking down a road
[1:16:06.500 --> 1:16:08.860]  halfway around the world in Afghanistan.
[1:16:08.860 --> 1:16:12.220]  The missiles hit all three targets and Bryant said he could see the aftermath on his computer
[1:16:12.220 --> 1:16:16.900]  screen including thermal images of a growing puddle of hot blood.
[1:16:16.900 --> 1:16:21.100]  The guy was running forward, missing his right leg.
[1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:27.100]  And I watched this guy bleed out and I mean the blood is hot looking at the thermal image.
[1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:29.100]  This is so tragic.
[1:16:29.100 --> 1:16:34.020]  Like I said, when we have a government that openly assassinates anyone that they want
[1:16:34.020 --> 1:16:38.340]  to anywhere in the world, it is a matter of time before that happens here in the US and
[1:16:38.340 --> 1:16:43.660]  we've already seen what appears to be the FBI executing people who might have a different
[1:16:43.660 --> 1:16:45.940]  version of their official story.
[1:16:45.940 --> 1:16:49.420]  And one last thing before we go to Alex, I would encourage you to take a look at an
[1:16:49.420 --> 1:16:52.840]  operation Paul Revere entry called American Drone.
[1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:55.500]  We posted it on our YouTube channel by permission.
[1:16:55.500 --> 1:17:00.060]  It's part of the Operation Paul Revere contest and it goes over this very thing, a very good
[1:17:00.060 --> 1:17:05.620]  short film dramatizing exactly what we're seeing here and that is people who are engaged
[1:17:05.620 --> 1:17:10.100]  in these unlawful acts developing a conscience about it.
[1:17:10.100 --> 1:17:11.380]  Now we're ready to go to Alex now.
[1:17:11.380 --> 1:17:12.380]  We've got him on the line.
[1:17:12.380 --> 1:17:13.380]  Is that correct?
[1:17:13.380 --> 1:17:14.380]  Yes, I'm here.
[1:17:14.380 --> 1:17:16.100]  Hey, Alex, thanks.
[1:17:16.100 --> 1:17:17.460]  Hey, David, thanks for being there.
[1:17:17.460 --> 1:17:22.740]  We're going to come back after the break with Max Kaiser here in our little makeshift studio
[1:17:22.740 --> 1:17:24.500]  from Wadford, North of London.
[1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:25.500]  Thanks a lot.
[1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:28.060]  Ride shotgun there for us in case we have any technical difficulties.
[1:17:28.060 --> 1:17:32.380]  And if you'd like people to see the entry you talked about, have the crew posted in
[1:17:32.380 --> 1:17:37.620]  the featured news section so people can see it at infowars.com.
[1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:39.580]  That is a really great idea.
[1:17:39.580 --> 1:17:40.900]  Thank you very much, David Knight.
[1:17:40.900 --> 1:17:44.340]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I've got a lot of other news other than Bilderberg.
[1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:47.220]  That I really want to get to.
[1:17:47.220 --> 1:17:56.900]  There is a huge amount of awakening now inside the United States dealing with the issue of
[1:17:56.900 --> 1:17:58.460]  illegal spying.
[1:17:58.460 --> 1:18:00.140]  Here are just some of the headlines today.
[1:18:00.140 --> 1:18:06.060]  Obama administration collecting phone records of millions of Americans daily.
[1:18:06.060 --> 1:18:12.620]  Secret court order requires Verizon to hand over all call data.
[1:18:12.620 --> 1:18:17.180]  White House defends critical tool against terrorist threats when they run Al Qaeda now
[1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:18.180]  publicly.
[1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:21.740]  We've gone from that being a theory to absolute a minute fact, but still they take all our
[1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:23.860]  rights because of their terrorist.
[1:18:23.860 --> 1:18:27.340]  Specifically target Americans, not foreigners, all completely illegal.
[1:18:27.340 --> 1:18:31.540]  Homeland security laptops, phones can be searched based on hunches.
[1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:35.380]  NSA sees all phone, sex, banks, and emails.
[1:18:35.380 --> 1:18:36.380]  Of course they do.
[1:18:36.380 --> 1:18:40.860]  NSA agents have gone public about how much they enjoy listening to you and your wife
[1:18:40.860 --> 1:18:42.260]  have sex, everything.
[1:18:42.260 --> 1:18:46.860]  And then they go on here, FBI wants a back door to all software that already goes on.
[1:18:46.860 --> 1:18:53.780]  CIA will spy on you through your dishwasher 1984 published 64 years ago today.
[1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:59.700]  That's the smart way drudgereport.com takes all the latest breaking news and then puts
[1:18:59.700 --> 1:19:08.700]  it together with 1984 has now arrived 60 plus years later, 64 years ago today, and I'm in
[1:19:08.700 --> 1:19:12.980]  the country air strip one of 1984.
[1:19:12.980 --> 1:19:14.460]  That's a story.
[1:19:14.460 --> 1:19:15.620]  That's a report.
[1:19:15.620 --> 1:19:24.220]  That's information today 1984, 64 years after it was published in 1948, and we have gone
[1:19:24.220 --> 1:19:25.220]  beyond it.
[1:19:25.220 --> 1:19:27.700]  But we've got to have two worlds in a paradox here.
[1:19:27.700 --> 1:19:31.820]  This great tyranny that's beyond 1984, but still people think they're free, think there's
[1:19:31.820 --> 1:19:35.620]  free press, think they have a right, so they really are free.
[1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:39.460]  Once you have this corrupt world trying to absorb everything and it's taken over the
[1:19:39.460 --> 1:19:43.340]  banking, it's taking over the media, it's using government regulators to shut down their
[1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:46.500]  competition, it is truly unprecedented.
[1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:51.260]  So when we come back, we're going to have Max Kaiser in studio to talk about the amazing
[1:19:51.260 --> 1:19:52.260]  coverage.
[1:19:52.260 --> 1:19:56.340]  I got interviewed no exaggeration, but like 10 international media outlets today.
[1:19:56.340 --> 1:20:00.740]  So the word is really getting out and we saw Queen Beaker exam more stay with us.
[1:20:00.740 --> 1:20:05.860]  Cal Bend soap company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old fashioned
[1:20:05.860 --> 1:20:10.940]  real soap that is triple concentrated and made from the highest quality vegetable and
[1:20:10.940 --> 1:20:12.420]  coconut oils.
[1:20:12.420 --> 1:20:21.980]  See them on the web www.5starsoap.com or call 1-800-340-7091 for a free catalog and buy
[1:20:21.980 --> 1:20:26.980]  American made products, order the sampler a one to two month supply or get a one to

[1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:39.860]  calls in the next hour so crew make me do it because I want to hear from people specifically
[1:24:39.860 --> 1:24:43.580]  that are in the UK the hundreds of people that were already out there today and I predicted
[1:24:43.580 --> 1:24:50.420]  just hundreds of the first day probably 1000 the next day and then maybe 2000 on Saturday
[1:24:50.420 --> 1:24:56.060]  when everybody can get up here and there is parking I don't want to get into the logistics
[1:24:56.060 --> 1:25:00.420]  we do an article on logistics for people for info wars.com for slash Bilderberg now Max
[1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:06.260]  Kaiser was a very successful stockbroker on Wall Street before he retired in early age
[1:25:06.260 --> 1:25:10.900]  the inventor of the Hollywood stock exchange virtual trading system used by counter and
[1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:14.700]  Fitzgerald is now used on many trading markets around the world you know who he is he doesn't
[1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:21.620]  need to be introduced and he's at TV shows on BBC Al Jazeera RT right now press TV you
[1:25:21.620 --> 1:25:26.900]  name it he's got it and I want to get his take on Bilderberg 2013 so he's here but I
[1:25:26.900 --> 1:25:30.060]  got to say this Max Kaiser kept saying you got to come to Europe you got to come to England
[1:25:30.060 --> 1:25:34.340]  I've been here like 7 years ago and been here before that and I maybe every 50th person
[1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:39.100]  I would cross down the street you know would say hey Alex Jones this I got mobbed a third
[1:25:39.100 --> 1:25:44.420]  of the people on the train just just walking down the street people hear my voice we have
[1:25:44.420 --> 1:25:50.660]  more listeners in England of every race color and creed religion than we have in the United
[1:25:50.660 --> 1:25:55.260]  States in Austin Texas my main command center Max it's great to have you here I don't talk
[1:25:55.260 --> 1:25:59.100]  about myself here but you brought this up today but but but I mean what does this mean
[1:25:59.100 --> 1:26:03.020]  not about Alex Jones that that alternative media is that popular because everybody knows
[1:26:03.020 --> 1:26:07.420]  you too well as I've been saying when I've been on your show before is that when I travel
[1:26:07.420 --> 1:26:13.060]  around Europe people ask me about Alex Jones and I think it's because English is the universal
[1:26:13.060 --> 1:26:17.580]  language around the world and people are hungry for alternative media and they gravitate toward
[1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:21.220]  Alex Jones so yeah you're well known all over Europe everywhere I've gone even when
[1:26:21.220 --> 1:26:26.220]  I was in Cairo people in the square would say we listen to Alex Jones so here you are
[1:26:26.220 --> 1:26:30.980]  in Bilderberg here you are in Watford and I personally have had a bit of a learning
[1:26:30.980 --> 1:26:37.100]  curve because you know my my feeling of Bilderberg over the years has been that do I really really
[1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:41.620]  care about Bilderberg but I think this year is a watershed year where now they've got
[1:26:41.620 --> 1:26:46.780]  their media kit they're on the media offensive they realize they're under the scrutiny and
[1:26:46.780 --> 1:26:53.140]  they're now being positioned as yet another one of these Davos G8 IMF global conferences
[1:26:53.140 --> 1:26:56.860]  where people get together and they shouldn't be doing what they're doing behind closed
[1:26:56.860 --> 1:27:01.060]  doors and thanks the effort from you and other independent media now we're finally getting
[1:27:01.060 --> 1:27:07.860]  somewhere with this I think it's incredible I want to get into the breaking news I mean
[1:27:07.860 --> 1:27:12.780]  I talked to the well-known guy on Newsnight he means like one of the biggest TV personalities
[1:27:12.780 --> 1:27:17.180]  here in the country I forget his name what is it Watson John Sargent you know this famous
[1:27:17.180 --> 1:27:23.100]  guy you know who he is you've been on BBC as a host and they told us they said no Bilderberg's
[1:27:23.100 --> 1:27:25.980]  going to probably give us an interview they're pretty freaked out by this I went with met
[1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:29.260]  with him he interviewed me because I'm going to have a special lunch now and he got in
[1:27:29.260 --> 1:27:34.820]  his car and from what I saw drove in I was like oh special lunch this has never happened
[1:27:34.820 --> 1:27:39.460]  and it's because first they wanted to be secrets so nobody talked about them now they realize
[1:27:39.460 --> 1:27:43.500]  being secrets blown up in their face and again there's other big top globalist meetings
[1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:47.380]  but it's all about that key word when we come back from break you're gonna break down you
[1:27:47.380 --> 1:27:52.140]  crystallize it it's collusion why is Bilderberg dangerous well that's that's that's the key
[1:27:52.140 --> 1:27:57.620]  word in my mind is that you've got guys here organizing the scandals that we'll be reading
[1:27:57.620 --> 1:28:02.300]  about in five years time so for example this year the big scandal with Apple and these
[1:28:02.300 --> 1:28:07.300]  other big companies not paying their taxes well the system whereby they don't pay taxes
[1:28:07.300 --> 1:28:12.060]  worked out in meetings like this a few years ago so they get together it's very anti competitive
[1:28:12.060 --> 1:28:15.900]  they engage in collusion they figure out how to bring in people like camping G and the
[1:28:15.900 --> 1:28:20.580]  other big accountants and the money managers and the politicians to work out how to minimize
[1:28:20.580 --> 1:28:25.380]  their taxes and to dominate markets and is very anti competitive that's the problem with
[1:28:25.380 --> 1:28:30.300]  these organizations is that they're anti free trade anti-American it's almost anti capitalist
[1:28:30.300 --> 1:28:34.860]  they just want to have price fixing market manipulation monopoly pricing rent seeking
[1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:39.500]  and they do it behind closed doors and they're colluding that's the word collusion and that's
[1:28:39.500 --> 1:28:44.660]  what we should be against and we're in the middle of a problem the biggest lobbying scandals
[1:28:44.660 --> 1:28:48.860]  ever in UK history there's the big secret lobby they've been indicted before with Lockheed
[1:28:48.860 --> 1:28:55.020]  Martin for you know aircraft deals overcharging the people in the Netherlands with Prince
[1:28:55.020 --> 1:28:59.420]  Bernhardt's we have to send his you know his daughter the Queen now now the King reportedly
[1:28:59.420 --> 1:29:03.940]  is going to be here we by the way Leanne McAdu got photos of the Queen of the Netherlands
[1:29:03.940 --> 1:29:08.180]  driving in Henry Kissinger Dave Rockefeller I mean they do not want this discussed we're
[1:29:08.180 --> 1:29:11.860]  going to go to break in a minute we're going to come back with the one the only Max Kaiser
[1:29:11.860 --> 1:29:15.220]  into the next hour and he's going to take some of your phone calls up to rig him up
[1:29:15.220 --> 1:29:19.940]  with a headset to be able to do that but Max Kaiser is right here with me I want to talk
[1:29:19.940 --> 1:29:24.540]  about that lobbying and I want to talk about how the mainstream media has screwed the pooch
[1:29:24.540 --> 1:29:30.860]  as they say by by by denying any of this exists for so long and now they're playing catch
[1:29:30.860 --> 1:29:35.900]  up show where he sees all of this going as people discover that the terrible policies

[1:35:36.340 --> 1:35:42.940]  and all the groundbreaking stuff that's going on and and and and just the fact that I was
[1:35:42.940 --> 1:35:49.500]  told by two senator aids and a major media mogul I mean I mean a guy worth very close
[1:35:49.500 --> 1:35:53.820]  to a billion dollars they don't Peter feels a good guy he'd like to meet with you and
[1:35:53.820 --> 1:35:57.580]  I just didn't follow up on it I was just like no thanks I probably should have said yeah
[1:35:57.580 --> 1:36:03.580]  put me on the airplane right now but you know that I build a burger the new people don't
[1:36:03.580 --> 1:36:06.380]  like what's happening and they want to fix things yeah the globalists have stolen the
[1:36:06.380 --> 1:36:10.940]  whole world through fraud now they want to play nice but the point is is that I'd play
[1:36:10.940 --> 1:36:16.580]  nice if they would just stop agenda 21 stop the shutdown of society so I've got all these
[1:36:16.580 --> 1:36:21.540]  huge things I need to get to and Max does as well and I'm going to kind of collate those
[1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:25.660]  and cover them and we're going to be taking your phone calls Max is very gracious he had
[1:36:25.660 --> 1:36:29.020]  international media I'm not bragging it's just showing that now we've gone from nobody
[1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:33.780]  at these things to I'm not exaggerating I was interviewed by Italian media Russian Al
[1:36:33.780 --> 1:36:39.700]  Zazira press TV five BBC six BBC's actually then a bunch of others so it's like eleven
[1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:44.100]  or twelve international outlets it's already airing I was interviewed for the Alex Jones
[1:36:44.100 --> 1:36:48.740]  show the top morning show with the attractive woman named Alex Jones and say hey you can
[1:36:48.740 --> 1:36:52.180]  marry me and then you won't have to change your change your name of course I love my
[1:36:52.180 --> 1:36:55.620]  wife it's a joke honey it's a joke but that's why they actually wanted me almost to make
[1:36:55.620 --> 1:37:00.300]  that joke so I learned that joke from them but I want to get serious here with Max Kaiser
[1:37:00.300 --> 1:37:05.660]  Max earlier you were ranting as we were driving in the car incredibly eloquently about why
[1:37:05.660 --> 1:37:09.860]  Bilderberg is important about what they're setting up about what they're doing about
[1:37:09.860 --> 1:37:13.900]  where this is going and and the fact that their policies have put them in charge and
[1:37:13.900 --> 1:37:18.460]  everybody knows they did the robbing so recap all those points you made and why you think
[1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:24.380]  this year is so important on Max Kaiser Max Kaiser dot com okay Alex well as I was saying
[1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:30.340]  before the break leading up to this year you know Bilderberg had a bit of a negative connotations
[1:37:30.340 --> 1:37:37.180]  because it was almost synonymous with this idea of conspiracy therapy of conspiracy
[1:37:37.180 --> 1:37:41.580]  therapy they can electro shock therapy is we love government exactly so they just put
[1:37:41.580 --> 1:37:49.660]  the pros and set up the 800 megawatts therapy gets busy therapy so so it's a theory is like
[1:37:49.660 --> 1:37:54.420]  synonymous with this idea so you know I'm talking about it it almost puts you into a category
[1:37:54.420 --> 1:38:00.100]  instantaneously of where there's a credibility issue but because of guys like yourself and
[1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:03.700]  others you know you keep hammering and hammering and hammering now I think there's a breakthrough
[1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:08.180]  where you know understand now that what's really Bilderberg is another one of these confabs
[1:38:08.180 --> 1:38:14.980]  where people get together and they plan economic sabotage for themselves and economic manipulation
[1:38:14.980 --> 1:38:20.580]  financial manipulation etc. and they're doing this all by themselves for themselves and
[1:38:20.580 --> 1:38:25.580]  now as you point out the global media is kind of focused on this I myself I will I will
[1:38:25.580 --> 1:38:30.900]  admit this I have not been Mr. Bilderberg following for for for the last few years
[1:38:30.900 --> 1:38:34.020]  even covering Davos and stuff where they're doing the same thing yeah I cover these things
[1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:38.220]  I have and but now I think because you've made it such an item it's hard to ignore it
[1:38:38.220 --> 1:38:42.740]  now and then this is what you've been good at is putting the focus of indie media that's
[1:38:42.740 --> 1:38:46.820]  a question media owned and paid for by these people never wanted to cover it what does
[1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:50.940]  it mean that they're all forced to cover it well there's two there's two there's a double
[1:38:50.940 --> 1:38:55.060]  edged sword there number one they're forced to cover it that's great number two there
[1:38:55.060 --> 1:38:59.500]  is now an opportunity for them to try to use our media resources to spin it you know they'll
[1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:03.420]  come out with a press release and they'll say well what we're doing here is we're saving
[1:39:03.420 --> 1:39:06.900]  the world and we're doing good things and they'll they'll sound more like Davos they'll
[1:39:06.900 --> 1:39:11.980]  sound more like the IMF and they'll come up you know remember 10 or 15 years ago Exxon
[1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:16.660]  mobile Exxon mobile it was being attacked by Greenpeace and then within a few years Exxon
[1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:21.220]  would use the images of Greenpeace to promote Exxon so Exxon children's charity brought
[1:39:21.220 --> 1:39:26.180]  shoot you by Bilderberg Exxon you know you see you see beautiful vistas and oceans and
[1:39:26.180 --> 1:39:30.260]  forests brought to you by Exxon and they would just borrow all the imagery from Greenpeace
[1:39:30.260 --> 1:39:33.740]  and they used to promote Exxon so I think that you can see this with Bilderberg is that Exxon
[1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:38.180]  didn't bring me beautiful oceans no so now that Bilderberg's been exposed as part of
[1:39:38.180 --> 1:39:44.420]  this group of colluding monopolist oligarchs they're gonna have to come out with a more
[1:39:44.420 --> 1:39:49.420]  nuanced PR spin and they're gonna have to try to promote themselves and do battles so this
[1:39:49.420 --> 1:39:54.460]  is the information where you have brought them to the battle so now the battle begins
[1:39:54.460 --> 1:40:00.380]  so you drew them out now you're an open battle open field battle so that that's where we
[1:40:00.380 --> 1:40:04.660]  are this year now people ask why why cover Bilderberg well first we draw out the shadow
[1:40:04.660 --> 1:40:08.420]  government and then now we've got to deal with their propaganda corps you drew them
[1:40:08.420 --> 1:40:13.740]  out and and done an excellent job I mean we brought them out all of us together but getting
[1:40:13.740 --> 1:40:18.180]  into crony capitalism if their own minutes have been leaked to come out that's what they're
[1:40:18.180 --> 1:40:21.540]  doing the easiest way to make money is just shut down your competition or your government
[1:40:21.540 --> 1:40:26.100]  contract and you've got government regulators meeting with the industries they're regulating
[1:40:26.100 --> 1:40:30.500]  I mean this is obviously illegal on so many fronts I mean how does this tie into the big
[1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:34.380]  lobbying scandal right now in the UK here's a good you know that yeah there's a huge lobbying
[1:40:34.380 --> 1:40:39.180]  scandal in the UK but here's a here's a prime example you've got the Chancellor of the Exchequer
[1:40:39.180 --> 1:40:44.100]  George Osborne who is launching something called help to buy which is like Fannie Mae
[1:40:44.100 --> 1:40:48.100]  and Freddie Mac if you remember that from America they government subsidized housing
[1:40:48.100 --> 1:40:51.940]  and they created the subprime housing bubble which burst and caused this huge financial
[1:40:51.940 --> 1:40:55.220]  crisis and when the people can't pay it back it doesn't matter because it's bailed out
[1:40:55.220 --> 1:40:58.900]  they still lose their house but the mega bankers get the money right so now George Osborne
[1:40:58.900 --> 1:41:03.020]  wants to bring that to the UK so they get the house and the money so they take a group
[1:41:03.020 --> 1:41:05.860]  like this like a Bilderberg what they'll get what they'll do and what they probably did
[1:41:05.860 --> 1:41:11.420]  last year was they said how can we reinflate the housing bubble and still keep the bond
[1:41:11.420 --> 1:41:15.900]  holders which are the people in this room whole here's an idea we'll institute a government
[1:41:15.900 --> 1:41:20.540]  guarantee help to buy scheme modeled on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac even though those programs
[1:41:20.540 --> 1:41:24.660]  have already been discredited and we'll reinflate this bubble we won't do anything about jobs
[1:41:24.660 --> 1:41:27.700]  won't do anything about competition won't do anything about anything to help the economy
[1:41:27.700 --> 1:41:31.340]  we're just gonna reinflate this bubble we're gonna launch that scheme and now this is exactly
[1:41:31.340 --> 1:41:35.740]  what he's done we broke it on our show we said this is a Ponzi scheme we got letters
[1:41:35.740 --> 1:41:40.140]  from George Osborne's office saying you can't call the Ponzi scheme we need to be more fair
[1:41:40.140 --> 1:41:46.980]  within two months every media outlet in the UK is now calling it a Ponzi scheme but gatherings
[1:41:46.980 --> 1:41:51.220]  like Bilderberg is where they figure out how to put together these Ponzi schemes because
[1:41:51.220 --> 1:41:56.500]  you need the cooperation from KPMG and Deloitte Tush and the big global accounting firms
[1:41:56.500 --> 1:42:00.340]  you need cooperation from global governments you need cooperation from global market manipulators
[1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:04.980]  and bankers so they go to their meetings they come up with a scheme like that they save
[1:42:04.980 --> 1:42:08.820]  their buddies in the bond market they get the politicians to roll it out as an official
[1:42:08.820 --> 1:42:12.740]  policy and now we're seeing the result of it so that's just one example and of course
[1:42:12.740 --> 1:42:16.980]  George Osborne's at Bilderberg this year they're gonna follow up on the scheme it is hatched
[1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:22.540]  behind doors at one of these confabs it's enormously destructive and who knows next
[1:42:22.540 --> 1:42:26.420]  year what they will have cooked up this year we won't know the damage that they're doing
[1:42:26.420 --> 1:42:30.980]  today until next year when it's rolled out officially as government policy and we see
[1:42:30.980 --> 1:42:35.300]  the damage that'll cause next year in the year after that.
[1:42:35.300 --> 1:42:38.920]  And just adding to what you said it's so frustrating when I was interviewed by six
[1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:43.580]  different BBC outlets and only a couple of them were halfway fair they would say so you
[1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:49.100]  say there's a meeting here you're a conspiracy theorist you're crazy we got this on video
[1:42:49.100 --> 1:42:52.460]  and I was like no there's a meeting and she said no there's not and then later she goes
[1:42:52.460 --> 1:42:56.940]  I was trying to provoke you no no they were trying to like display this game insulting
[1:42:56.940 --> 1:43:01.300]  their viewers but that doesn't work anymore we've gotten the National Archives minutes
[1:43:01.300 --> 1:43:06.940]  we've gotten it and they are in there establishing the EU not to create freedom but to implode
[1:43:06.940 --> 1:43:12.780]  national sovereignty as the EU is now done to to sign the people of the EU France Germany
[1:43:12.780 --> 1:43:17.020]  all of it onto these trillions of debt that aren't theirs it's the same thing on the US
[1:43:17.020 --> 1:43:20.660]  it's the very same crew and then I interviewed we've got to upload this by the way Paul I
[1:43:20.660 --> 1:43:26.580]  totally forgot I've got the interview it's on the white phone right here with one of
[1:43:26.580 --> 1:43:33.140]  the UKIP EU members of parliament and he just he was reminding me that it was a Nazi plan
[1:43:33.140 --> 1:43:38.020]  to create the European Economic Union under a free trade agreement to manage everyone
[1:43:38.020 --> 1:43:42.100]  economically that was Hitler's plan and then they basically adopted it the British in the
[1:43:42.100 --> 1:43:46.940]  US did because they adopted everything else oh run our rockets run our CIA run everything
[1:43:46.940 --> 1:43:50.500]  it's not even so much Nazi as it's like oh we'll take that that's a really great plan
[1:43:50.500 --> 1:43:54.260]  we like your black uniforms you're really evil we're impressed with you will you tell us
[1:43:54.260 --> 1:43:57.860]  how to do everything and Prince Bernhard the Nazi who's you know daughter of the queen
[1:43:57.860 --> 1:44:02.900]  is advocating over to the the new king she's here Liam McAdoo our photographer photographed
[1:44:02.900 --> 1:44:05.900]  it she's up there uploading and running out of Twitter at real all it shows and on the
[1:44:05.900 --> 1:44:14.460]  reporter Twitter I mean it's just the realization that creepy CIA MI6 and Nazis set this up
[1:44:14.460 --> 1:44:24.700]  as a creepy combine monopoly capitalist organization and that they're doing all of this and that
[1:44:24.700 --> 1:44:28.460]  we've gotten all these minutes over the years that have leaked out national archives that
[1:44:28.460 --> 1:44:35.500]  they are in there like live or fixing the the I mean here's an example Google now I
[1:44:35.500 --> 1:44:39.860]  want to ask you about this Google but I'll talk about the Nazi thing Google okay Google
[1:44:39.860 --> 1:44:43.940]  Berg is merging right now we confirm that for inside stores whether they were so mad we
[1:44:43.940 --> 1:44:47.900]  were in the hotel over well yeah when we sent people in as we have sources inside the at
[1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:53.180]  the meeting serving people last year and then again a few weeks ago Google meets their Google
[1:44:53.180 --> 1:44:56.580]  plan the air of spring there they brag yeah yeah we're gonna talk about it but but I'm
[1:44:56.580 --> 1:45:00.620]  just telling the viewers so they know we're not just saying this that's why the security
[1:45:00.620 --> 1:45:03.660]  was had tears in their eyes when they caught us in there again because they've all been
[1:45:03.660 --> 1:45:08.780]  threatened with being fired we really got people in their serving and then once we said it
[1:45:08.780 --> 1:45:13.020]  it was like oh my god it's true then we actually found articles about it pieces of it confirming
[1:45:13.020 --> 1:45:16.180]  what our sources said then I talked to a high level Senate source they said no that's the
[1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:21.260]  plan they believe in the technocracy max of merging you know this whole system so the
[1:45:21.260 --> 1:45:26.820]  old men who are on average over 80 or 97 like David Rockefeller they're passing the satanic
[1:45:26.820 --> 1:45:32.140]  baton and they're planning to merge this whole deal but meanwhile because they're desperate
[1:45:32.140 --> 1:45:37.300]  they're like how do we control the media while all this is going on and then now Bilderberg
[1:45:37.300 --> 1:45:42.180]  is metastasizing out what is your take on all of that when they say oh it's a conspiracy
[1:45:42.180 --> 1:45:46.380]  theory when the international media interviewed me that that that these guys are important
[1:45:46.380 --> 1:45:52.260]  well for the last 50 60 years it's been a tug of war between the creation of debt to
[1:45:52.260 --> 1:45:57.980]  fund growth and the subsequent downturns or recession that would occur every five or
[1:45:57.980 --> 1:46:03.740]  seven years to kind of purge the system of bad investments and and malinvestments what
[1:46:03.740 --> 1:46:09.500]  happened in 2007 2008 is the bad debts that have been accumulated for 50 years suddenly
[1:46:09.500 --> 1:46:15.300]  got so huge that understanding went out there in the global community that these debts would
[1:46:15.300 --> 1:46:18.980]  never be paid and this is when the panic set in so here we are five or six years into
[1:46:18.980 --> 1:46:23.060]  this crisis these economies are still shrinking they're still contracting in Europe and in
[1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:28.100]  Greece and in and in Cyprus and all in France now just announced unemployment numbers that
[1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:32.700]  are quite high these economies are still shrinking in in ways that we haven't seen in the post
[1:46:32.700 --> 1:46:37.020]  world war two era this is the longest running economic contraction we've seen so all the
[1:46:37.020 --> 1:46:42.540]  tricks that these guys have used in the past to inflate debt to do whatever they can do
[1:46:42.540 --> 1:46:47.820]  to get some GDP growth have failed and that's why this is becoming more urgent and that's
[1:46:47.820 --> 1:46:53.100]  why a Bilderberg group they hope to come out of here with some new you know plan to create
[1:46:53.100 --> 1:46:57.740]  some kind of growth somewhere but it's just not materializing so the it brings it because
[1:46:57.740 --> 1:47:01.300]  they've already created a monopoly they'll only allow growth that makes them there's
[1:47:01.300 --> 1:47:05.740]  just too much debt so you this old skeletons in the closet like the Nazis you know they're
[1:47:05.740 --> 1:47:10.500]  back and what's happening in France there was a skinhead attack of a left winger and
[1:47:10.500 --> 1:47:15.580]  he's now brain dead there there's a neo-nazi party in Greece you know the Nazis are back
[1:47:15.580 --> 1:47:22.300]  in Europe because the like ghostbusters you know you know if you don't keep them at bay
[1:47:22.300 --> 1:47:27.660]  they will find their way back into the mail were brought in by bad economy so well you
[1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:31.900]  know I made the point on my blog recently that the Versailles agreement after World
[1:47:31.900 --> 1:47:37.620]  War One that put these onerous conditions on Germany which led to the rise of a psycho
[1:47:37.620 --> 1:47:43.340]  a madman now the onerous conditions after the 2008 break the debt that's been put into
[1:47:43.340 --> 1:47:48.460]  place around the world that people have to suffer what they call austerity is now having
[1:47:48.460 --> 1:47:52.220]  a global reaction you know I call it the global insurrection against banker occupation
[1:47:52.220 --> 1:47:56.940]  there's a global reaction now to these debts that were unfairly imposed you go back to
[1:47:56.940 --> 1:48:01.980]  the Versailles you see how similarly the many were asked to suffer the consequences of the
[1:48:01.980 --> 1:48:07.980]  mistakes of the few we had a few bankers create enormous mistakes in the years 2000 period
[1:48:07.980 --> 1:48:13.060]  the dot-com boost and then the subprime collapse they've been asking the global population
[1:48:13.060 --> 1:48:17.700]  to pay for those mistakes and after five or six years now since it hasn't worked we have
[1:48:17.700 --> 1:48:24.620]  the emergence of radical extremist right wing groups like neo-nazis are now back in the picture
[1:48:24.620 --> 1:48:30.100]  so this is history repeating itself in a lot of ways and then they'll also fund fake left
[1:48:30.100 --> 1:48:34.700]  wing groups to give a communist answer to the crisis and the media will give it attention
[1:48:34.700 --> 1:48:38.460]  instead of just getting back to common sense real free market that's what's so frustrating
[1:48:38.460 --> 1:48:42.340]  they're scapegoating free market for what the megabanks have done when they're the opposite
[1:48:42.340 --> 1:48:47.740]  of a free market they have protected guaranteed markets with my money you know the old saying
[1:48:47.740 --> 1:48:54.940]  of risk is made public but the profits you know are made private well as you know it's
[1:48:54.940 --> 1:49:00.100]  not about the collapse of the failure of free markets that we don't have free markets we
[1:49:00.100 --> 1:49:06.100]  have markets that have been co-opted by a certain groups that have been able to change
[1:49:06.100 --> 1:49:10.980]  the way markets operate entirely flash trading well you got the flash crashes and what that
[1:49:10.980 --> 1:49:15.460]  all is about is that this whole idea that a market should be equally balanced between
[1:49:15.460 --> 1:49:20.580]  risk and reward has been destroyed using derivatives which lead to things like flash trading so
[1:49:20.580 --> 1:49:26.180]  that risk is now concentrated in the population in the many the rewards are taken or skimmed
[1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:31.100]  off because if we have to bail out their mistakes why shouldn't they make a mistake
[1:49:31.100 --> 1:49:36.620]  and then we get bailed out we bail them out but now we're bailed out it's our debt they
[1:49:36.620 --> 1:49:41.100]  call it moral hazard in other words they keep bailing out the bad guys and they keep doing
[1:49:41.100 --> 1:49:44.500]  bad things but I'll give you a good example here's the stock market at fifteen thousand
[1:49:44.500 --> 1:49:49.980]  or so in the Dow Jones it's going to crash at some point probably in the near future
[1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:53.820]  the those who understand how the derivative markets work they already have their insurance
[1:49:53.820 --> 1:49:59.700]  on they've spent one or two percent buying a put or a contract that gives them the ability
[1:49:59.700 --> 1:50:04.620]  not to suffer any losses once the market crashes but the vast majority of people out there
[1:50:04.620 --> 1:50:08.340]  are completely unhedged they're completely exposed to this market so when there is this
[1:50:08.340 --> 1:50:12.540]  crash it's going to come there'll be another ten to fifteen trillion dollars of equity
[1:50:12.540 --> 1:50:16.940]  wiped out amongst the vast majority of people out there they got sucked in at the top but
[1:50:16.940 --> 1:50:21.060]  that's those people who orchestrated this maneuver they're completely protected they
[1:50:21.060 --> 1:50:26.260]  have no risk no skin in the game whatsoever for one or two percent of the value you have
[1:50:26.260 --> 1:50:31.340]  at risk you can buy an insurance product in the form of a put and insulate yourself entirely
[1:50:31.340 --> 1:50:35.820]  against any losses and that's this asymmetric warfare that goes on between people who have
[1:50:35.820 --> 1:50:39.220]  a solution to go to break we're going to break come back and explain that more and we're
[1:50:39.220 --> 1:50:43.340]  going to also get him hooked up with some headphones the next hour and take some phone calls for

[1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:32.020]  this but we're just discussing the fact that there is the fact that there's shadowy groups
[1:54:32.020 --> 1:54:35.180]  that want to influence policy and who want to take over government to get ahold of your
[1:54:35.180 --> 1:54:38.820]  tax money and banker bailouts and corporate welfare and they're like oh that doesn't
[1:54:38.820 --> 1:54:44.180]  exist haha conspiracy everybody knows there's no powerful interest meeting surely charge
[1:54:44.180 --> 1:54:49.180]  thousands a year per county and everywhere in the u.s. or in england with conspiracy
[1:54:49.180 --> 1:54:54.940]  two people decided to rob a liquor store it's a conspiracy but powerful people never conspire
[1:54:54.940 --> 1:55:00.580]  i mean i didn't know what max agrees it's outrageous he agrees but uh... stacey harbert
[1:55:00.580 --> 1:55:06.180]  uh... one of the producers and host of uh... max keiser's a many uh... shows here uh...
[1:55:06.180 --> 1:55:10.900]  she was really a great adam smith quote the famous uh... wealth of nations uh... economists
[1:55:10.900 --> 1:55:17.100]  and i guess that was in chapter four page one forty five paragraph c twenty seven an
[1:55:17.100 --> 1:55:22.580]  incredible quote about conspiracies we all know adam smith was nobody
[1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:26.100]  this is all i this is this is a conspiracy theory
[1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:30.340]  exactly you know and what but a lot of times when these people gather outside the likes
[1:55:30.340 --> 1:55:32.980]  of bill de berg or g eight
[1:55:32.980 --> 1:55:36.940]  bbc news and major media will call them anti-capitalist
[1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:38.540]  so it's important to
[1:55:38.540 --> 1:55:42.100]  listen carefully to a adam smith in the wealth of nations
[1:55:42.100 --> 1:55:44.180]  no other book is more important
[1:55:44.180 --> 1:55:47.740]  to the ideals of capitalism than the wealth of nations
[1:55:47.740 --> 1:55:48.740]  and he said
[1:55:48.740 --> 1:55:55.180]  people of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion
[1:55:55.180 --> 1:55:59.780]  but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public
[1:55:59.780 --> 1:56:03.780]  or in some contrivance to raise prices
[1:56:03.780 --> 1:56:08.180]  that is often quoted frequently i've heard that a few times but nobody continues with
[1:56:08.180 --> 1:56:09.540]  the rest of it
[1:56:09.540 --> 1:56:13.020]  in light of what the governments are doing to enable this
[1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:17.740]  he then said but though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from
[1:56:17.740 --> 1:56:19.900]  sometimes assembling together
[1:56:19.900 --> 1:56:21.740]  it ought to do nothing
[1:56:21.740 --> 1:56:27.100]  to facilitate such assemblies much less to render them necessary
[1:56:27.100 --> 1:56:28.340]  which the police are
[1:56:28.340 --> 1:56:31.980]  asked backwards guarding them right now doing the opposite of that common sense
[1:56:31.980 --> 1:56:35.740]  well in george osborne and his labor shadow
[1:56:35.740 --> 1:56:39.780]  and balls are attending why are they attending they don't need to attend they
[1:56:39.780 --> 1:56:42.540]  shouldn't have to have the attorney general there too
[1:56:42.540 --> 1:56:45.700]  i'm not sure about that i mean i mean that this is outrageous
[1:56:45.700 --> 1:56:49.260]  yeah yeah well it's outrageous that george osborne
[1:56:49.260 --> 1:56:54.060]  should be at the moment especially the fact that amazon jeff bezos these people
[1:56:54.060 --> 1:56:54.820]  are
[1:56:54.820 --> 1:56:56.420]  currently
[1:56:56.420 --> 1:57:01.340]  in a very big brouhaha here about avoiding taxes well not paying a while lobbying to
[1:57:01.340 --> 1:57:05.020]  raise middle-class taxes to bail out banks exacts not enough to try to get out of
[1:57:05.020 --> 1:57:09.620]  taxes they then want me to fit the bill for all them yes well this is the the
[1:57:09.620 --> 1:57:13.700]  problem you know george osborne has these austerity measures across
[1:57:13.700 --> 1:57:15.460]  the u k
[1:57:15.460 --> 1:57:16.340]  as we see
[1:57:16.340 --> 1:57:19.780]  they're preparing for the g eight you know they've created a patemkin village
[1:57:19.780 --> 1:57:21.980]  to make it look like austerity is working
[1:57:21.980 --> 1:57:27.980]  as they're raising taxes on everybody here taxes in that whole thing up there
[1:57:27.980 --> 1:57:31.380]  in farmena where they're outside of belfast where they're having the g eight
[1:57:31.380 --> 1:57:32.380]  conference
[1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:34.860]  that there's just devastation
[1:57:34.860 --> 1:57:38.620]  the shops are closed down the butcher shops is dilapidated that the local
[1:57:38.620 --> 1:57:41.980]  shops are all dilapidated so what they've done is they put posters up
[1:57:41.980 --> 1:57:43.020]  to make it look
[1:57:43.020 --> 1:57:46.620]  to make it look like it's a literal wallpaper facade that's like when the
[1:57:46.620 --> 1:57:50.620]  queen of england goes to africa they'll have a soundstage with a fake village
[1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:53.020]  yeah yeah i mean this is unbelievable
[1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:56.020]  what they're doing now in ireland to make it look like the economy and then if you
[1:57:56.020 --> 1:57:59.020]  say that's paper wallpaper of a happy shop
[1:57:59.020 --> 1:58:02.020]  you're the conspiracy theorist
[1:58:02.020 --> 1:58:06.620]  neo is a conspiracy theorist george washington that's a good point is that
[1:58:06.620 --> 1:58:10.620]  the cops here should not be protecting these people gathering because as out of
[1:58:10.620 --> 1:58:13.420]  what said they have a propensity to fix prices
[1:58:13.420 --> 1:58:17.500]  they should not exactly instead of making good products to win its users is by

[2:00:33.420 --> 2:00:34.700]  your host alex jones
[2:00:34.700 --> 2:00:37.260]  i want to hear from u k callers
[2:00:37.260 --> 2:00:41.700]  uh... their take on taxpayers having to pay for these globalist to meet here
[2:00:41.700 --> 2:00:44.380]  the toll-free number to join us is eight hundred
[2:00:44.380 --> 2:00:46.940]  two five nine ninety thirty one
[2:00:46.940 --> 2:00:50.620]  and some of people can't call from england on that i forget the
[2:00:50.620 --> 2:00:54.820]  uh... specific number were supposed to give out with a certain prefix
[2:00:54.820 --> 2:00:57.220]  uh... so that people are able to call maybe
[2:00:57.220 --> 2:01:00.100]  maybe the network can text that to you richard as i forgot some of the people
[2:01:00.100 --> 2:01:01.500]  can't call that a number
[2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:04.980]  uh... if they're an angle it's always good to remember that eight hundred two
[2:01:04.980 --> 2:01:08.180]  five nine ninety thirty one
[2:01:08.180 --> 2:01:12.340]  but coming up with a new phone calls again max keiser's my guest that was an
[2:01:12.340 --> 2:01:14.540]  amazing adam smith quote
[2:01:14.540 --> 2:01:16.060]  uh...
[2:01:16.060 --> 2:01:17.620]  but i think
[2:01:17.620 --> 2:01:19.820]  from stacy yes they see uh...
[2:01:19.820 --> 2:01:24.060]  made an excellent point there as she always does on our show and
[2:01:24.060 --> 2:01:27.100]  but uh... you know if you want to follow up on that i mean the cops should not
[2:01:27.100 --> 2:01:30.780]  allow this gathering because we know that they'll be price collusion going on
[2:01:30.780 --> 2:01:33.500]  price-fixing and that should be discouraged these guys should be
[2:01:33.500 --> 2:01:34.620]  separated
[2:01:34.620 --> 2:01:39.100]  and forced to compete with each other not collude with each other
[2:01:39.100 --> 2:01:41.340]  but according to them they're not doing any of that i mean
[2:01:41.340 --> 2:01:44.860]  even though we have all the documents but yeah exactly about as we've known for
[2:01:44.860 --> 2:01:47.740]  two hundred years now since the publication of uh...
[2:01:47.740 --> 2:01:51.260]  wealth of nation and adam smith that this is the propensity of businessmen to
[2:01:51.260 --> 2:01:54.860]  do this with this is hard-coded into the dna of free market
[2:01:54.860 --> 2:01:55.980]  capitalism
[2:01:55.980 --> 2:01:59.340]  for two hundred thirty years or so that we know this is what's going to happen
[2:01:59.340 --> 2:02:03.460]  so the people running our governments like of the obama or the david cameron
[2:02:03.460 --> 2:02:07.060]  they should be out front making sure these things don't happen these people
[2:02:07.060 --> 2:02:10.460]  don't get together they did that they should be forced to compete to make
[2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:12.300]  money instead of collude
[2:02:12.300 --> 2:02:14.300]  to make money
[2:02:14.300 --> 2:02:17.740]  you're absolutely right we're going to come back and just open the phones up

[2:02:36.340 --> 2:02:39.340]  even seeing that those phones were all ringing right there
[2:02:39.340 --> 2:02:42.100]  i see this occasionally and we figure out the phone system
[2:02:42.100 --> 2:02:44.740]  uh... is down but we'll get that phone system rebooted
[2:02:44.740 --> 2:02:47.900]  eight hundred two five nine ninety thirty one
[2:02:47.900 --> 2:02:51.380]  uh... so that number so often i can i just kind of mill it all together now
[2:02:51.380 --> 2:02:53.020]  eight hundred two five
[2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:56.220]  nine ninety two thirty one of your in the u k
[2:02:56.220 --> 2:03:01.700]  the number to call in is one six five one six nine five seven seven five five

[2:03:15.220 --> 2:03:16.700]  uh... with you here but
[2:03:16.700 --> 2:03:20.300]  as we go to break here how do you think bill deberg
[2:03:20.300 --> 2:03:21.540]  is going to deal
[2:03:21.540 --> 2:03:24.860]  and and other shadow government meetings now that they're being identified that
[2:03:24.860 --> 2:03:26.380]  there are special interest
[2:03:26.380 --> 2:03:30.100]  pulling the strings oh my gosh what an epiphany but that is an epiphany for the
[2:03:30.100 --> 2:03:31.260]  naive public
[2:03:31.260 --> 2:03:34.300]  that really thought the government love them is going to take good care of them
[2:03:34.300 --> 2:03:38.500]  i think they're going to roll out the public relations offensive
[2:03:38.500 --> 2:03:41.980]  so we're going to start bill deberg is going to start branding itself and we're
[2:03:41.980 --> 2:03:46.180]  going to start seeing ads support bill deberg the group that is doing good
[2:03:46.180 --> 2:03:47.580]  things for you
[2:03:47.580 --> 2:03:52.300]  and this is one magical way that modern consumer culture has evolved
[2:03:52.300 --> 2:03:56.700]  in that the people doing the worst things are able to roll out the most
[2:03:56.700 --> 2:04:00.460]  egregious propaganda ads to support what they're doing so now that they've been
[2:04:00.460 --> 2:04:04.860]  identified as being part of the bad guys the monsanto the exxon
[2:04:04.860 --> 2:04:07.620]  the microsoft's you know they're part of the bad guys
[2:04:07.620 --> 2:04:09.940]  so now they're gonna have to come out with a lot of
[2:04:09.940 --> 2:04:13.060]  uh... advertising and p r spin to somehow
[2:04:13.060 --> 2:04:16.500]  uh... spin and promote themselves as the good guys and since they own a
[2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:20.580]  monopoly position position in the media outlets they have will have an excellent
[2:04:20.580 --> 2:04:23.180]  uh... chance of doing so but that's where india media
[2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:24.340]  and info wars
[2:04:24.340 --> 2:04:28.860]  you know is is going to be uh... in an open war now but that the war is now
[2:04:28.860 --> 2:04:31.020]  that gone to the open field
[2:04:31.020 --> 2:04:34.020]  and uh... so that's a good for for india media
[2:04:34.020 --> 2:04:36.980]  because it was a hard to fight them when they were hiding
[2:04:36.980 --> 2:04:39.780]  in the in the shadows as they have been but now that they're out in the open i
[2:04:39.780 --> 2:04:41.700]  think it's going to be easier to fight them

[2:10:45.940 --> 2:10:48.700]  i mean that's like going back to feudalism where you looked at the
[2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:51.220]  king of the lord ron maxon so
[2:10:51.220 --> 2:10:53.300]  you're going to be disappeared now

[2:11:03.620 --> 2:11:07.380]  establishment the elite and everyone else's has to be constantly on guard
[2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:10.340]  it's a complete repudiation of everything that we learned during the
[2:11:10.340 --> 2:11:11.260]  enlightenment
[2:11:11.260 --> 2:11:14.900]  the atmosphere that we just talked about it is the repudiation of the
[2:11:14.900 --> 2:11:17.940]  free market capitalism is a repudiation of the enlightenment we're going back
[2:11:17.940 --> 2:11:21.900]  to medievalism but you can't argue gave us all this well
[2:11:21.900 --> 2:11:24.380]  tyranny of the government did not give us this
[2:11:24.380 --> 2:11:28.340]  well i mean this is what i have a slight problem in the united states anyway
[2:11:28.340 --> 2:11:30.940]  with the encroachment of
[2:11:30.940 --> 2:11:32.580]  let's say uh...
[2:11:32.580 --> 2:11:35.580]  religious fundamentalism to some degree because some of these guys like
[2:11:35.580 --> 2:11:38.780]  lindsey graham and others are going to start claiming that they have the divine
[2:11:38.780 --> 2:11:42.140]  right well he just uses that as a front they use the christians yeah well they
[2:11:42.140 --> 2:11:46.140]  use the christians in a way that will end up they'll be starting to claim that
[2:11:46.140 --> 2:11:49.020]  they have they are operating under the divine right of kings
[2:11:49.020 --> 2:11:51.180]  and that they have the divine right to
[2:11:51.180 --> 2:11:53.620]  put people in jail because they were looked at funny
[2:11:53.620 --> 2:11:57.420]  and this is where we sing happening in real time it's it's quite uh... quite
[2:11:57.420 --> 2:11:58.820]  alarming at the speed
[2:11:58.820 --> 2:12:02.660]  at which the u.s. is sinking into a hellhole really
[2:12:02.660 --> 2:12:06.820]  of a comp of a complete the right list of the way you're really saying that
[2:12:06.820 --> 2:12:10.380]  and i've got to say i've seen some police state here but most the cops either
[2:12:10.380 --> 2:12:12.220]  say all i care about is rugby
[2:12:12.220 --> 2:12:13.820]  or they say i'm a listener
[2:12:13.820 --> 2:12:17.420]  i'm really ashamed to say this because i say america's waking up and it is to
[2:12:17.420 --> 2:12:18.380]  great extent
[2:12:18.380 --> 2:12:22.860]  i have been in england and it is a wake i mean i cannot
[2:12:22.860 --> 2:12:24.820]  walk down the street
[2:12:24.820 --> 2:12:28.380]  without having twice the tension i get in the united states which which again i
[2:12:28.380 --> 2:12:29.300]  see is a
[2:12:29.300 --> 2:12:33.940]  radar sonar ping man let me tell you that you're right back to you but how can
[2:12:33.940 --> 2:12:37.220]  europe be under such deep tyranny is that why they're more away about the u k
[2:12:37.220 --> 2:12:41.620]  person because in the u k unlike the u s you have actually a left-wing press
[2:12:41.620 --> 2:12:45.420]  there is a left in the u k you have people who are in the communist party
[2:12:45.420 --> 2:12:47.100]  and they have seats in parliament
[2:12:47.100 --> 2:12:49.140]  and there's a left-wing press
[2:12:49.140 --> 2:12:50.700]  and you have real debate
[2:12:50.700 --> 2:12:54.540]  uh... between what is identified as right-wing issue a real libertarians like
[2:12:54.540 --> 2:12:55.980]  u k they're good guys
[2:12:55.980 --> 2:12:59.180]  well u k is challenging the people on the right
[2:12:59.180 --> 2:13:02.980]  and you've got uh... people of course uh... who are identified with the left
[2:13:02.980 --> 2:13:04.220]  but you end up with
[2:13:04.220 --> 2:13:09.020]  a lot more debate in terms of uh... political agenda which people are
[2:13:09.020 --> 2:13:11.720]  discussing any interfilters down to the man
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:14.300]  on the street in the rank and file the police department who are a lot more
[2:13:14.300 --> 2:13:17.540]  aware of some of these political debates going on where's in the u s you've got
[2:13:17.540 --> 2:13:18.580]  the far right
[2:13:18.580 --> 2:13:19.780]  and the near right
[2:13:19.780 --> 2:13:23.180]  they don't even have a center it's all right way in the united states there's no
[2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:26.780]  there's no left at all and there's no liberal media at all now see i would
[2:13:26.780 --> 2:13:30.500]  agree i'd say it's all established you got a fake left and a fake
[2:13:30.500 --> 2:13:34.340]  right you would see liberal as like thomas jefferson liberal but when
[2:13:34.340 --> 2:13:38.140]  americans here you say liberal they're thinking the malice do you know it's a
[2:13:38.140 --> 2:13:39.080]  justice department
[2:13:39.080 --> 2:13:42.740]  well yeah because of the propaganda put out by people like bill deberg who like
[2:13:42.740 --> 2:13:45.940]  to keep people extremely focused on
[2:13:45.940 --> 2:13:47.660]  enemies that don't exist
[2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:52.900]  on uh... shying away from true media debate so your perception of they're
[2:13:52.900 --> 2:13:58.220]  being more let's say conversations with people who are in the blue collar world
[2:13:58.220 --> 2:13:59.180]  like cops
[2:13:59.180 --> 2:14:03.140]  and nurses and things like that is because they have a much more dynamic
[2:14:03.140 --> 2:14:06.460]  functioning media here in the u k i mean i'm curious to hear what there's no
[2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:09.540]  doubt there's more choices watchers opinion is of this you know he's a
[2:14:09.540 --> 2:14:10.300]  native
[2:14:10.300 --> 2:14:14.380]  uh... british the guy i don't know if you might have a different opinion but
[2:14:14.380 --> 2:14:18.580]  my my thought it is compared to the states you you do have some more
[2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:21.940]  dynamism maybe i'm maybe i'm being hoodwinked and that's not true i'm
[2:14:21.940 --> 2:14:25.540]  curious with what's in us to say that's a that's an important video you you are
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:27.100]  curious i would like to know
[2:14:27.100 --> 2:14:29.060]  all right supreme red card
[2:14:29.060 --> 2:14:33.500]  what was the point again
[2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:36.500]  i was saying that he meets people on the street and they seem a lot more
[2:14:36.500 --> 2:14:40.260]  politically awake and aware and i was saying well one of the reason is that
[2:14:40.260 --> 2:14:43.380]  there's a more dynamic media here in the u k there is a left there's a right
[2:14:43.380 --> 2:14:44.100]  there's more
[2:14:44.100 --> 2:14:47.380]  there's more debate at least i mean there are also cops that go all i care
[2:14:47.380 --> 2:14:50.420]  about is rugby it doesn't mean there's a lot more they're not enjoying greater
[2:14:50.420 --> 2:14:54.180]  rights necessarily but at least there's a lot more debate given the diversity in
[2:14:54.180 --> 2:14:57.260]  media that i was because they've been screwed harder
[2:14:57.260 --> 2:14:59.380]  there are a few years ahead of it
[2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:01.920]  i think it's in america is a very
[2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:05.220]  america is isolated a lot of americans haven't even left america they don't
[2:15:05.220 --> 2:15:08.820]  have passports where it is a conspiracy theory that europe even exists
[2:15:08.820 --> 2:15:12.340]  literally oh yeah where is it but they think like in u.s. ends it falls off the
[2:15:12.340 --> 2:15:16.500]  earth yeah yeah no that's exactly it but in britain it's a tiny country
[2:15:16.500 --> 2:15:19.540]  we're out looking at europe we're looking out we're not looking in with a lot
[2:15:19.540 --> 2:15:21.380]  of americans looking inwards because
[2:15:21.380 --> 2:15:23.820]  they're not aware of anything that's happening in europe they don't leave the
[2:15:23.820 --> 2:15:25.140]  country very often
[2:15:25.140 --> 2:15:27.340]  and you're right there is more of a left-wing
[2:15:27.340 --> 2:15:31.980]  element in britain compared to america where a lot of it is centered around
[2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:36.100]  the occupy movement which was very easily infiltrated and steered off to
[2:15:36.100 --> 2:15:37.100]  something else
[2:15:37.100 --> 2:15:39.980]  so yeah there's more diversity in terms of media
[2:15:39.980 --> 2:15:43.220]  and opinions and you were saying yesterday alex that you've you've got the
[2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:45.460]  sense that people were more awake here
[2:15:45.460 --> 2:15:48.540]  they've heard of bill the boat but they may not have necessarily heard of you
[2:15:48.540 --> 2:15:50.940]  oh yeah a lot of them didn't even know about it we're telling me about the new
[2:15:50.940 --> 2:15:52.540]  world order
[2:15:52.540 --> 2:15:54.500]  and they were going oh yeah who are you by the way
[2:15:54.500 --> 2:15:57.860]  so even without your massive impact people are waking up which is good
[2:15:57.860 --> 2:16:00.140]  because you know it's it's a diverse thing
[2:16:00.140 --> 2:16:03.900]  but yeah i agree with max says there's more kind of left-wing press but they're
[2:16:03.900 --> 2:16:06.620]  awake but their solutions are big government
[2:16:06.620 --> 2:16:09.340]  because they see it going and stopping the big bankers but the big bankers
[2:16:09.340 --> 2:16:10.620]  run big government
[2:16:10.620 --> 2:16:13.620]  yeah so how do you have this
[2:16:13.620 --> 2:16:16.800]  is that their solution is typically to
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:18.000]  enhanced government
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:21.260]  or the streamline government but there's a government or a solution which i i
[2:16:21.260 --> 2:16:24.900]  disagree with but i think it's important to have that conversation because
[2:16:24.900 --> 2:16:28.020]  clearly government well there's a real leftist here they're not like a
[2:16:28.020 --> 2:16:31.740]  authoritarian gang like obama well they would have a role in those who are
[2:16:31.740 --> 2:16:33.940]  saying before in regulating markets
[2:16:33.940 --> 2:16:37.380]  this is where i disagree with people like lou rockwell for example who is a
[2:16:37.380 --> 2:16:41.260]  libertarian to the point of what he calls anarcho capitalism
[2:16:41.260 --> 2:16:44.900]  which is he believes markets are self-correcting
[2:16:44.900 --> 2:16:49.820]  and they're never wrong i disagree in that markets must have some fundamental
[2:16:49.820 --> 2:16:54.220]  rudimentary like football regulations or or or they will game right they're
[2:16:54.220 --> 2:16:57.100]  gonna make the rules which is they're gonna screw you the problem with the
[2:16:57.100 --> 2:17:01.020]  markets today is that they the rules are don't exist or they're not being
[2:17:01.020 --> 2:17:04.500]  enforced and so we're not people are vilifying capitalism and then to get to
[2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:08.980]  your point well well well we get to your point that there's that left out let
[2:17:08.980 --> 2:17:11.660]  them do what they want but don't bail them out there's that my issue is don't
[2:17:11.660 --> 2:17:15.140]  be let them have total freedom but then they go to jail they repeat but let me
[2:17:15.140 --> 2:17:20.260]  let me say this but the result of mob the rise of the mob due to the collapse of
[2:17:20.260 --> 2:17:25.740]  fake capitalism is identified as a left-wing reaction but i would disagree
[2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:30.380]  with that also it's not it is that you could call it a populist reaction or a
[2:17:30.380 --> 2:17:34.100]  chaotic real reaction but you can't put a political label on it but the right
[2:17:34.100 --> 2:17:38.300]  would say look there are the lefties and they're their mob and they're fighting
[2:17:38.300 --> 2:17:40.700]  us and that's the way that's where they see that's where buildeburg will come
[2:17:40.700 --> 2:17:46.980]  out of this with their button rebranding that you will be positioned as a left
[2:17:46.980 --> 2:17:52.620]  wing mob a populist that's all that all the papers welcome on newsstands it's
[2:17:52.620 --> 2:17:57.260]  like communist to protest capitalist meeting but but when these are insiders
[2:17:57.260 --> 2:18:01.460]  the opposite of a free market if you go to infowars.com and you're selling pure
[2:18:01.460 --> 2:18:06.940]  water filters i mean you're not selling you know left-wing agenda you are a
[2:18:06.940 --> 2:18:12.740]  businessman you have a media outlet you are part of a economy that values
[2:18:12.740 --> 2:18:16.580]  hard work oh yeah leftist i know think it's bad to even sell a product let me
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:18.980]  make this point here because we're going to break max we're come back with calls
[2:18:18.980 --> 2:18:22.980]  this is really important they try to scramble all the terms i think is what
[2:18:22.980 --> 2:18:26.540]  we're getting to here and here's buildeburg that uses government to
[2:18:26.540 --> 2:18:30.060]  control its wealth and take over others and then they call their opposition
[2:18:30.060 --> 2:18:34.500]  communist which it's the opposite i didn't really run into the communist out
[2:18:34.500 --> 2:18:38.660]  there today i mean it's my point they're populist that don't want to be cheated
[2:18:38.660 --> 2:18:43.220]  so that's what comes out there are there are hardcore left-wingers like tony
[2:18:43.220 --> 2:18:47.780]  ben for example you know he's a famous left-winger and twin when the left of
[2:18:47.780 --> 2:18:52.500]  labor government was in power you know they have people who are titans and big
[2:18:52.500 --> 2:18:59.460]  wigs big names in the left wing and they got blown away by tony blair who came
[2:18:59.460 --> 2:19:04.740]  in as new labor but as margaret thatcher said you know she was about to
[2:19:04.740 --> 2:19:09.260]  retire one of her greatest achievements in life when asked what is your greatest
[2:19:09.260 --> 2:19:12.620]  achievement she said one of the greatest achievements was new labor in other
[2:19:12.620 --> 2:19:18.260]  words new labor became the right wing establishment and that killed labor that
[2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:21.420]  killed the left-wing politics in this country said new labor under tony blair
[2:19:21.420 --> 2:19:25.060]  which is really just thatcherism light and then you had thatcherism and there
[2:19:25.060 --> 2:19:28.340]  hasn't really been anything since then yeah but it's all globalism because the
[2:19:28.340 --> 2:19:32.660]  they've done that to the right wing again all these terms mean nothing you know
[2:19:32.660 --> 2:19:36.740]  the bottom line is we shouldn't bail out mega rich bankers with our tax money
[2:19:36.740 --> 2:19:39.940]  while they lecture us all day that it's wrong to make a hundred twenty five
[2:19:39.940 --> 2:19:43.300]  thousand dollars a year but you're saying that as a business man and yet the
[2:19:43.300 --> 2:19:48.220]  establishment will say you're saying that as a communist i know but i'm saying
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:52.420]  it as somebody that wants to run my own life and not be fed on by a bunch of fat
[2:19:52.420 --> 2:19:56.460]  cat pigs we'll be right back with your phone calls and max geyser i'm alex

[2:24:54.940 --> 2:24:58.380]  we're here's that this is a chart of the you know the dollar is plunging right
[2:24:58.380 --> 2:25:03.620]  now here i don't know how to do it oh there you go the dollar is plunging and
[2:25:03.620 --> 2:25:07.380]  i want to talk about a prediction i made on your show ten months ago i said
[2:25:07.380 --> 2:25:13.780]  within nine months and i said april there would be a big a big event and your
[2:25:13.780 --> 2:25:18.220]  start over why because we're now we're on the air what is really good to move the
[2:25:18.220 --> 2:25:22.820]  mind is wrong with you people i said on your show ten months ago there would be
[2:25:22.820 --> 2:25:28.780]  a major crash of some time and probably april here we are now in june first week
[2:25:28.780 --> 2:25:32.140]  of june i'm gonna have later okay so the timing is pretty good we've got it favors
[2:25:32.140 --> 2:25:37.220]  the bold yeah major crash in the dollar looks like japan is blowing up as i said
[2:25:37.220 --> 2:25:41.300]  it would bond market yields are now rising as i said it would how much is it
[2:25:41.300 --> 2:25:45.700]  dropping it's huge okay so let me make this point clear i went on a limb and
[2:25:45.700 --> 2:25:50.020]  made a very specific prediction on your show because i was trying to out out
[2:25:50.020 --> 2:25:53.700]  gerald salante gerald salante okay i wanted to get a specific date so i could
[2:25:53.700 --> 2:25:58.500]  be the prognosticator of the year award well i missed by five or six days a few
[2:25:58.500 --> 2:26:03.700]  weeks so gerald still has the crown of top prognosticator in the world but the
[2:26:03.700 --> 2:26:09.300]  point is that here we are on a major collapse dollar bonds it's all coming
[2:26:09.300 --> 2:26:13.420]  unglued in japan as i said alex i want to go and record because most of phone
[2:26:13.420 --> 2:26:17.500]  calls chardburg is meeting yeah these phone calls are gonna be like what about
[2:26:17.500 --> 2:26:21.820]  april what about april here it is this is all happening this just is all
[2:26:21.820 --> 2:26:25.620]  revolving in real time and this is the crash this is the armageddon this is the
[2:26:25.620 --> 2:26:33.500]  bondpocalypse now additionally i want to point out that i also would like to
[2:26:33.500 --> 2:26:40.540]  claim how much is it dropped that's huge my prediction if you were to price all
[2:26:40.540 --> 2:26:44.860]  of these securities against the bitcoin that i'm absolutely correct that there
[2:26:44.860 --> 2:26:47.700]  was a major collapse in april i don't i know you don't want to go into the
[2:26:47.700 --> 2:26:51.020]  bitcoin thing but i just want to get that on record that against bitcoin i
[2:26:51.020 --> 2:26:56.500]  was exactly to the day but against our of it let me ask you this question are
[2:26:56.500 --> 2:27:00.500]  you friends with peter field i'm not friends with peter field but we are
[2:27:00.500 --> 2:27:05.380]  co-investors in a bitcoin related company called bit pay which i encourage
[2:27:05.380 --> 2:27:10.180]  you at info wars to use to accept so the people with bitcoins are billions of
[2:27:10.180 --> 2:27:14.420]  people with bitcoins out there they want to spend them an info wars dot com but
[2:27:14.420 --> 2:27:19.900]  there's no way to do it with bit pay they can spend bit coin on your site yes
[2:27:19.900 --> 2:27:26.620]  i'm comment during the microphone with bit pay they can use bitcoin to buy the
[2:27:26.620 --> 2:27:31.500]  pro pure water filters to buy the info wars t-shirt to buy the paul watchson
[2:27:31.500 --> 2:27:37.100]  fan club buttons to buy the alex jones i saw alex jones at the mall buttons and

[2:27:42.020 --> 2:27:46.580]  and they didn't buy them with bitcoin using bit pay bit pay dot com now
[2:27:46.580 --> 2:27:51.580]  peter teal and i are co-investors in bit pay so we ever talk to him now we i've
[2:27:51.580 --> 2:27:56.740]  not talked to him he is one of the gang from paypal that has made a billion
[2:27:56.740 --> 2:28:00.500]  dollars or so we came together simply because we're co-investors through the
[2:28:00.500 --> 2:28:06.660]  ceo of bit pay a guy named tony gallipi who has me investing in bit pay but you
[2:28:06.660 --> 2:28:11.260]  got to accept it going right good boy pick up a coin all right he's he's he's

[2:28:38.780 --> 2:28:42.380]  problems and he's trying to get him to go public i kind of and by the way would

[2:33:44.180 --> 2:33:47.420]  funding our media operation that's how we do it the goal is to defeat the
[2:33:47.420 --> 2:33:53.580]  globalist he does this snore noise probe here 15% off water 15 okay I want to go
[2:33:53.580 --> 2:33:56.940]  to phone calls but you had one of the point that you wanted to make we got
[2:33:56.940 --> 2:34:01.940]  Steve Watson coming in here about Ed Ball about UKIP okay Nigel Farage became a
[2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:06.740]  global media sensation before he was even on the radar in British politics
[2:34:06.740 --> 2:34:11.020]  because of your show because of RT Russia today my network now you kept
[2:34:11.020 --> 2:34:14.740]  told me that that's right so that's again where them global media is
[2:34:14.740 --> 2:34:18.140]  exerting pressure and changing the political landscape that's why
[2:34:18.140 --> 2:34:22.460]  Bilderberg now has to respond because they look at Nigel Farage if there was no
[2:34:22.460 --> 2:34:26.780]  Alex Jones no RT no global independent media space Nigel Farage would not be
[2:34:26.780 --> 2:34:31.460]  getting 15% of the general vote in Britain so this is really a global
[2:34:31.460 --> 2:34:36.940]  phenomenon the BBC is so dusty and so old and so protected they're totally
[2:34:36.940 --> 2:34:40.500]  arrogant and they they haven't changed at all 30-40 years and after the so-called
[2:34:40.500 --> 2:34:44.220]  hot in the fair from a few years ago they're completely afraid to do any
[2:34:44.220 --> 2:34:47.420]  breaking news whatsoever any investigative journalism whatsoever I've
[2:34:47.420 --> 2:34:50.100]  talked to journalists over the BBC they're like in a bombshell they're over
[2:34:50.100 --> 2:34:53.420]  there they can't put their nose out and investigate any way Bilderberg kept
[2:34:53.420 --> 2:34:58.660]  driving in today with some paper I haven't found yet that said child pedophile
[2:34:58.660 --> 2:35:02.860]  killer released they would use it the paper to cover their face and then
[2:35:02.860 --> 2:35:08.460]  Stacy you were telling me about your friend that tried to fly in here to as
[2:35:08.460 --> 2:35:13.260]  the press tried to come in here to cover I want to get in to talk about that
[2:35:13.260 --> 2:35:17.460]  tried to cover the whole pedophile stuff was surveil before it broke and they
[2:35:17.460 --> 2:35:21.100]  stopped her at the border our reporter got sent back as well go ahead well the
[2:35:21.100 --> 2:35:24.140]  pedophile scandals in this country have been around for a while there's a
[2:35:24.140 --> 2:35:28.700]  function actually of the very onerous libel laws in this country that prevent
[2:35:28.700 --> 2:35:32.020]  people from speaking out the reason Jimmy Saville was able to violate four
[2:35:32.020 --> 2:35:36.820]  or five hundred boys and girls minors with sexual assault is because if you go
[2:35:36.820 --> 2:35:40.660]  to the press and you say I believe this man is sexually assaulting me he can sue
[2:35:40.660 --> 2:35:43.060]  you for everything you're worth and the way the libel law set up here is
[2:35:43.060 --> 2:35:47.020]  different the United States is that instead of having to prove who's at
[2:35:47.020 --> 2:35:51.220]  fault here it's completely reversed so that you the victim ends up paying all
[2:35:51.220 --> 2:35:56.940]  the legal costs and you the victim invariably end up getting you know taken
[2:35:56.940 --> 2:36:00.740]  down by the establishment so this is why Jimmy Saville was able to operate for
[2:36:00.740 --> 2:36:04.360]  years without any significant challenges because of the libel laws that
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:06.900]  exist here in this country now take something very interesting Alex
[2:36:06.900 --> 2:36:11.140]  challenges that America one thing that the Obama administration did recently as
[2:36:11.140 --> 2:36:15.900]  they passed a law that gives Americans an exemption if they're in Britain if I
[2:36:15.900 --> 2:36:19.140]  ever say something that is considered libelist by somebody here in Britain
[2:36:19.140 --> 2:36:26.140]  there it would be incumbent upon them to take that case to America they could
[2:36:26.140 --> 2:36:32.300]  not take me to a local jurisdiction for libel prosecution here's the expert
[2:36:32.300 --> 2:36:37.900]  here's the expert Joe Lieberman introduced it and originally what it was
[2:36:37.900 --> 2:36:40.940]  so Alex Jones you're here in the UK you're an American citizen and you say
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:46.260]  something that Ed Balls decides to sue you for libel what would happen is that
[2:36:46.260 --> 2:36:52.300]  if it were not libel in the US courts which it wouldn't be they will not
[2:36:52.300 --> 2:36:57.660]  enforce it the US courts will not enforce a libel judgment now Joe Lieberman
[2:36:57.660 --> 2:37:02.380]  tried to make it that in fact there would be an automatic three times penalty
[2:37:02.380 --> 2:37:07.260]  against the UK citizen or person who sued you in a UK court to do that so that
[2:37:07.260 --> 2:37:10.860]  is a certain exception and something that's good that happened for the US
[2:37:10.860 --> 2:37:14.780]  citizens like a basically a loophole in the law in that be some of the lot of
[2:37:14.780 --> 2:37:17.740]  times you'll say that guy is a jerk and they'll say I'm gonna see you for libel
[2:37:17.740 --> 2:37:20.620]  and say well that now the way the law reads under Lieberman is like if it's
[2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:24.820]  not considered libel in the US then they can't sue you here in the UK so it's a
[2:37:24.820 --> 2:37:28.540]  loophole that you as an American broadcaster now in the UK you can say
[2:37:28.540 --> 2:37:32.340]  pretty well anything you can say you would say in America here and nobody in
[2:37:32.340 --> 2:37:36.660]  the UK establishment can essentially sue you for libel you've got a free open
[2:37:36.660 --> 2:37:40.940]  speech here in thanks to Joe Lieberman so that's one thing that got through the
[2:37:40.940 --> 2:37:44.900]  Joe Lieberman everything else he does I don't like but here it's an open season
[2:37:44.900 --> 2:37:48.580]  it's open season prox shows they can't come after you for libel thanks to Joe

[2:38:04.180 --> 2:38:07.860]  how you see them how you see them going and and let's look at can you go get
[2:38:07.860 --> 2:38:13.540]  Steve who just ran into Ed Balls tell people who Ed Balls is he's the Kibler
[2:38:13.540 --> 2:38:19.900]  elves mommy no he's the shadow yeah they have shadow government so he's the
[2:38:19.900 --> 2:38:24.540]  shadow chancellor yeah the exchequer which of course is always the finance
[2:38:24.540 --> 2:38:28.940]  minister so go go get Steven here I want to take some phone calls thank you for
[2:38:28.940 --> 2:38:35.180]  holding a Kathleen in Britannia all beyond or England you're on the air with
[2:38:35.180 --> 2:38:45.540]  Max Kaiser who's up past his bedtime we can barely hear you but go ahead yeah you
[2:38:45.540 --> 2:38:51.980]  can hear me now I can hear you now okay I am an American who's been living in the
[2:38:51.980 --> 2:38:57.900]  UK for 28 years I haven't lost my accent I keep going back and forth to the state
[2:38:57.900 --> 2:39:03.260]  so I've got a good idea of cultures on both sides and because I am American I
[2:39:03.260 --> 2:39:07.500]  fit in different places here than if I was a British born because I don't
[2:39:07.500 --> 2:39:10.940]  belong to any particular class I found this out when I was living in Cambridge
[2:39:10.940 --> 2:39:16.500]  but there's such a class divide but if you're American you don't count so it's
[2:39:16.500 --> 2:39:23.860]  easy to fit in both places so I managed to you know get involved in that circle
[2:39:23.860 --> 2:39:31.620]  in Cambridge so great great well anyway the main thing here that I see is the
[2:39:31.620 --> 2:39:36.260]  difference between the two societies is that the average person here is
[2:39:36.260 --> 2:39:45.820]  dependent on one way or another on the government either it's true you know the
[2:39:45.820 --> 2:39:52.180]  NHS which most people have you know access to or benefits like housing
[2:39:52.180 --> 2:39:57.660]  benefit now I have two children who both work and are paying taxes and we still
[2:39:57.660 --> 2:40:04.940]  because of prices because of prices cannot afford a place to live outside of
[2:40:04.940 --> 2:40:08.500]  here and we still so it's collectivization collectivization to control
[2:40:08.500 --> 2:40:15.100]  your domestication all right so so can I ask right so the question then is you're
[2:40:15.100 --> 2:40:19.340]  just making a comment about the how the how to contrast the two countries are
[2:40:19.340 --> 2:40:27.060]  really part of it but I just have to get my I have to get my daughter to stop
[2:40:27.060 --> 2:40:30.100]  knocking on the door while I'm talking okay well let's talk about that for a
[2:40:30.100 --> 2:40:33.460]  second because here in the UK and in France and elsewhere in Europe the
[2:40:33.460 --> 2:40:39.380]  government is composed is up to 50% here in the UK 49% of the GDP is the
[2:40:39.380 --> 2:40:43.940]  government in America I believe the last I saw something like 32% of the economy
[2:40:43.940 --> 2:40:48.860]  is the government in our in France it's almost 60% of the economy is the
[2:40:48.860 --> 2:40:52.100]  government they have 100% tax on right and people again that's right they're
[2:40:52.100 --> 2:40:55.420]  getting a tax on 100% of their income so here you have this reasonable way of
[2:40:55.420 --> 2:40:59.460]  this tension between total government and free enterprise and should the
[2:40:59.460 --> 2:41:03.660]  government be involved in picking companies to be started etc and you
[2:41:03.660 --> 2:41:08.660]  have this tension going on so here in this country you've got the government
[2:41:08.660 --> 2:41:14.620]  which is up to 50% of the economy but there are problems but the part of the
[2:41:14.620 --> 2:41:17.660]  solution those problems would be that the government is now allowing for
[2:41:17.660 --> 2:41:22.060]  privatization so things like the NHS and things like education and the
[2:41:22.060 --> 2:41:25.300]  transportation system are being tossed to private developers and private
[2:41:25.300 --> 2:41:29.740]  contractors their solution is to leverage up these institutions with a
[2:41:29.740 --> 2:41:33.340]  huge amounts of debt so they're willing they say we don't want the government
[2:41:33.340 --> 2:41:37.500]  shouldn't be involved in these things like the NHS or transportation or
[2:41:37.500 --> 2:41:40.980]  education but what we're going to do as private contractors is we're going to
[2:41:40.980 --> 2:41:45.140]  take over these facilities and we're going to increase the debt load by
[2:41:45.140 --> 2:41:50.540]  trillions of pounds. But they still want the government to backstop their debt.
[2:41:50.540 --> 2:41:58.100]  It's all a piratical deal. Instead of having a long business name, take your
[2:41:58.100 --> 2:42:02.740]  wrist or bone. Ma'am what do you think of Turdburg? What do you think of
[2:42:02.740 --> 2:42:06.180]  Bilderberg? Absolutely. What do you think of Bilderberg meeting in your country and
[2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:11.100]  taxpayers having to pay for it? Well I believe that this is what I was saying
[2:42:11.100 --> 2:42:17.780]  about the benefit bill. I believe all of that was arranged by meetings such as
[2:42:17.780 --> 2:42:22.580]  this one in order to keep people compliant. You said yesterday you
[2:42:22.580 --> 2:42:25.940]  noticed that everybody was awake. Yes they're awake because everybody has
[2:42:25.940 --> 2:42:30.660]  suffered under the system who is like the average person on the street. I think
[2:42:30.660 --> 2:42:35.060]  if you talk to the public you'll know of at least just about everybody has
[2:42:35.060 --> 2:42:38.220]  known somebody who's had children taken away by the government or known
[2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:42.940]  somebody who's died at the hands of the NHS when they shouldn't have. There is so
[2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:47.300]  much suffering. Yeah everybody I know talks about how my wife went in to have
[2:42:47.300 --> 2:42:51.660]  a small thing and died. Absolutely you're right no no I think that's why
[2:42:51.660 --> 2:42:55.180]  they're awake because they're under the eugenics hammer. God bless you ma'am good
[2:42:55.180 --> 2:42:59.300]  to hear from you. I agree with you. Scott in Idaho you want to talk about
[2:42:59.300 --> 2:43:06.180]  Bilderberg you're on the air with Alex Jones and Max Kaiser. Both of you. Hey
[2:43:06.180 --> 2:43:11.620]  buddy. It was George Washington I believe Alex that said truth will
[2:43:11.620 --> 2:43:16.620]  ultimately prevail where there be pains taken to bring it to light and I think
[2:43:16.620 --> 2:43:20.620]  that that's a lot of what we're trying to do. I recently wrote a letter to my
[2:43:20.620 --> 2:43:26.340]  local newspaper and editorial wherein I wrote a shortlist of what I think is
[2:43:26.340 --> 2:43:31.380]  wrong with America and why I think the Second Amendment is so important and if
[2:43:31.380 --> 2:43:36.460]  you'd be so kind I'd like to read that short editorial. Sure go ahead only 20
[2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:42.860]  pages. They limited to about 360 words or something like that. I wrote that
[2:43:42.860 --> 2:43:47.820]  something is terribly wrong with this country of ours. Come on people wake up
[2:43:47.820 --> 2:43:53.380]  and smell the tyranny endless wars torture extraordinary rendition highest

[2:45:09.460 --> 2:45:15.700]  freedom and now they want us to give up our right to defend our self this
[2:45:15.700 --> 2:45:20.780]  sounds exactly like a song from Gil Scott Heron Gil Scott Heron was one of
[2:45:20.780 --> 2:45:25.140]  the first rappers going back to the 1970s and part of it the movement which
[2:45:25.140 --> 2:45:29.380]  included the last poets and during the civil rights period in late 60s early
[2:45:29.380 --> 2:45:35.060]  70s when the emergence of black culture in America you had artists like Gil
[2:45:35.060 --> 2:45:39.740]  Scott Heron who would sing songs using that type of words that type of phrase
[2:45:39.740 --> 2:45:44.500]  theology and at the time of course most of America would not consider someone
[2:45:44.500 --> 2:45:48.540]  like Gil Scott Heron an artist but it turns out that he's a profit that Gil
[2:45:48.540 --> 2:45:51.780]  Scott Heron is a profit of who we are today in America he's written some
[2:45:51.780 --> 2:45:55.340]  brilliant material you look back about the Reagan years of track called beam
[2:45:55.340 --> 2:45:59.660]  movie or another track about winter in America I mean these are some of the
[2:45:59.660 --> 2:46:03.020]  artists in American history that have been ignored and that if you want to
[2:46:03.020 --> 2:46:06.820]  find out you know the profits of who saw all this coming you go back and you
[2:46:06.820 --> 2:46:10.220]  find out that this is not a shock to a lot of people who have been oppressed
[2:46:10.220 --> 2:46:13.900]  before the white guys start getting oppressed there's a lot more oppression
[2:46:13.900 --> 2:46:17.860]  absolutely thank you caller great points that you made here we're gonna go to

[2:47:13.300 --> 2:47:22.420]  well okay we were traveling here from London from Euston station and we arrived
[2:47:22.420 --> 2:47:27.660]  at Watford Junction and we were just getting some cash out of an ATM and I
[2:47:27.660 --> 2:47:32.340]  was just looking around just you know thinking about getting in a cab coming to
[2:47:32.340 --> 2:47:41.100]  this hotel extreme and very extreme and I saw someone whose face I it clicked in
[2:47:41.100 --> 2:47:45.980]  my head but it didn't immediately register the name and I thought is that
[2:47:45.980 --> 2:47:52.900]  Ed Balls so I googled his googled his image and a character from who's the
[2:47:52.900 --> 2:47:57.340]  who's the British comedy he's American but he does the making fun of the James
[2:47:57.340 --> 2:48:07.260]  Bond Austin powers Austin powers Ed Balls sacred agent keep going so yeah and
[2:48:07.260 --> 2:48:16.100]  he was with he was with a handler of some kind yeah possibly possibly but it
[2:48:16.100 --> 2:48:24.540]  was definitely Eric pickles I presume was a 400 pound guy no it wasn't a skinny
[2:48:24.540 --> 2:48:28.940]  guy wasn't Eric pickles noise so yeah there's the shadow Chancellor has come
[2:48:28.940 --> 2:48:35.380]  to build a burg on public transport and that just means that and also we saw a
[2:48:35.380 --> 2:48:40.740]  couple of others sharp-looking sharp-looking guys dressed expensive
[2:48:40.740 --> 2:48:44.100]  suits I've got some video of it but I don't know if there's anything usable
[2:48:44.100 --> 2:48:50.020]  I know it is as important to show them she over and talk to them well I I saw
[2:48:50.020 --> 2:48:53.700]  Ed Balls it registered in my mind I went outside I couldn't see him anywhere and
[2:48:53.700 --> 2:48:56.580]  there was a guy hanging around that I thought he was with and we waited for
[2:48:56.580 --> 2:49:02.020]  about 15 minutes but he'd gone so then we got in a cab and we asked the cab
[2:49:02.020 --> 2:49:07.420]  driver if he'd taken anyone to the Grove obviously so wasn't that guy because
[2:49:07.420 --> 2:49:12.020]  he would ever come back he said excellent job Steve he said he hasn't
[2:49:12.020 --> 2:49:16.540]  taken anyone today but ladies and gentlemen that is Stevie Steve Watson of

[2:55:11.460 --> 2:55:18.340]  right now I'm first and foremost I want to thank you for taking my call and I
[2:55:18.340 --> 2:55:22.460]  love the work that you and the crew at info wars.com are doing especially the
[2:55:22.460 --> 2:55:27.780]  press coverage that you're giving to the Bilderberg conference it wasn't even
[2:55:27.780 --> 2:55:33.140]  until a few months ago that I was turned on to you and your website by a friend
[2:55:33.140 --> 2:55:39.100]  of mine at work and I thought that you know people at work called me a
[2:55:39.100 --> 2:55:43.700]  conspiracy not because of what I felt was wrong in this government and you
[2:55:43.700 --> 2:55:48.580]  know here you are just you know putting all this out there for everyone to see
[2:55:48.580 --> 2:55:53.180]  and it just justifies everything that I've always believed about our government
[2:55:53.180 --> 2:55:59.540]  what I want to ask is you know there are people are protesting they're creating
[2:55:59.540 --> 2:56:03.460]  petitions they're yelling they're getting mad about everything that our
[2:56:03.460 --> 2:56:10.180]  government is doing but when is enough enough I feel that what the people here
[2:56:10.180 --> 2:56:14.300]  in America are doing is not effective because these politicians continue to
[2:56:14.300 --> 2:56:18.860]  get away with what they're doing. That's a good question Max. That's a good
[2:56:18.860 --> 2:56:22.300]  question how do we instead of a question it's a quest
[2:56:22.300 --> 2:56:31.780]  Sean what do we do to defeat them? Well I have my opinion on this and I think
[2:56:31.780 --> 2:56:36.180]  it's a three-pronged attack number one independent media we got that covered
[2:56:36.180 --> 2:56:40.540]  number two you got to hit them in the currency level that means that local
[2:56:40.540 --> 2:56:44.220]  currencies like here in the UK there's the Bradford Pound I believe in Bradford
[2:56:44.220 --> 2:56:48.780]  they had their own currency so the people I'm sorry Bristol I'm sorry the
[2:56:48.780 --> 2:56:52.780]  Bristol Pound so the people in Bristol have traded their own local currency and
[2:56:52.780 --> 2:56:57.180]  they trade with each other so it's all very local. So media currency currency and
[2:56:57.180 --> 2:57:03.140]  then thirdly you know I think that I'm very seriously believe that crypto
[2:57:03.140 --> 2:57:08.780]  currencies are an important mix of how to defeat the new world order. I
[2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:11.780]  sincerely believe it I'm gonna appreciate you fact that I can be able to
[2:57:11.780 --> 2:57:18.260]  talk about it on this show. But look the dollar is plunging Bitcoin prices
[2:57:18.260 --> 2:57:21.700]  holding up and gold and silver I've been acting very well the dollars are
[2:57:21.700 --> 2:57:24.900]  vulnerable. They've been artificially trying to suppress gold and silver. Well
[2:57:24.900 --> 2:57:29.300]  they of course would normally they'd have to be you can't just manipulate
[2:57:29.300 --> 2:57:33.460]  bond prices and stock prices and credit default swaps so that also made it our
[2:57:33.460 --> 2:57:37.340]  LIBOR implied with all that is manipulating gold and silver it's all
[2:57:37.340 --> 2:57:41.180]  part of the same matrix of markets that are being managed. The caller is that
[2:57:41.180 --> 2:57:46.940]  basically your point you're looking for solutions? Yeah you know when when do we
[2:57:46.940 --> 2:57:51.500]  take this fight to them you know what. Okay let me ask you this I want to ask
[2:57:51.500 --> 2:57:56.020]  Alex Jones a question based on your question caller okay Adam Kokesh who is
[2:57:56.020 --> 2:58:03.100]  a warrior the info warrior he was calling for okay an armed march on
[2:58:03.100 --> 2:58:10.540]  Washington with guns and stuff he spent a night in tour jail what is your
[2:58:10.540 --> 2:58:14.500]  thought Alex Jones on what Adam Kokesh has been talking about I noticed that
[2:58:14.500 --> 2:58:19.980]  we're now going to commercial. Those damn commercials all right now that's the
[2:58:19.980 --> 2:58:24.060]  end of the transmission that okay no no I'll give you oh we played that just on
[2:58:24.060 --> 2:58:31.860]  time because of that. It is a conspiracy. Fine hey I know you're exhausted
[2:58:31.860 --> 2:58:35.020]  Max wanted to overdrive now because of his arrogance we will give him the
[2:58:35.020 --> 2:58:40.820]  answer to Adam Kokesh and the groom of the school straight ahead.

[3:00:23.980 --> 3:00:38.580]  Max Kaiser is on fire right now. Ladies and gentlemen, I got my crew yelling
[3:00:38.580 --> 3:00:43.860]  keep it down Kaiser. I think this is the whole point like say don't be wet
[3:00:43.860 --> 3:00:48.380]  ocean. Now the transmission continues. David Ikson will be in studio with us
[3:00:48.380 --> 3:00:56.220]  tomorrow. You were asking about Adam Gokash. Yes. My whole issue is we're
[3:00:56.220 --> 3:00:59.700]  winning the Info War. I don't want to give the Fed some excuse to stage some
[3:00:59.700 --> 3:01:03.500]  event and that's why I think he saw the light and didn't do that federal march.
[3:01:03.500 --> 3:01:07.940]  So I mean what's your take on that Max Kaiser? Well I thought it was
[3:01:07.940 --> 3:01:12.140]  extremely you know if I can use the word Balty you know on this show I mean
[3:01:12.140 --> 3:01:15.780]  it's he's really putting himself out there because you this idea of sedition
[3:01:15.780 --> 3:01:19.980]  and encouraging people for armed insurrection is clearly something the
[3:01:19.980 --> 3:01:25.140]  government is going to be anti and he put himself out there made that call. So
[3:01:25.140 --> 3:01:30.060]  I guess the I guess what my take away from it is that he's put that idea in
[3:01:30.060 --> 3:01:35.220]  people's head which is an idea that it's like a taboo. You couldn't really say it
[3:01:35.220 --> 3:01:39.780]  in public. He did he spent his night in jail but now that idea is out there. People
[3:01:39.780 --> 3:01:43.380]  think you know what damn it this is how this country started for you know what
[3:01:43.380 --> 3:01:46.860]  do we swim well no no no listen I get all that but the redcoats came and started
[3:01:46.860 --> 3:01:52.740]  the fight first trying to take the guns. So you only use violence defensively
[3:01:52.740 --> 3:01:56.060]  the and I don't think he was pushing for violence either but the media try to
[3:01:56.060 --> 3:02:02.380]  you know portray it that way. My whole issue is 90% of war is Info War. So I
[3:02:02.380 --> 3:02:06.340]  don't want to get into a physical confrontation because I want to try to
[3:02:06.340 --> 3:02:11.500]  fix things intellectually that's what I'm going for here. I understood I'm just
[3:02:11.500 --> 3:02:14.660]  saying in his case Adam Cokesh who I followed for a number of years as part
[3:02:14.660 --> 3:02:17.620]  of the Info War people that we've been following for years I've changed to me
[3:02:17.620 --> 3:02:21.660]  that he took it to another level that's all. I was just curious what people in
[3:02:21.660 --> 3:02:25.900]  the independent media community thought about it. It's quite you know quite a
[3:02:25.900 --> 3:02:29.420]  thing to do I think because he could have he could have gone sent away for 20
[3:02:29.420 --> 3:02:32.900]  years. Yeah but I told Pierce Morgan I said you try to take the guns gonna start
[3:02:32.900 --> 3:02:36.180]  a civil war. Not Pierce you know he reversed himself by the way. Yeah he
[3:02:36.180 --> 3:02:39.300]  reversed himself. That was very interesting wasn't it on CNN. He said in
[3:02:39.300 --> 3:02:44.100]  in in relation to another item that came up after your parents he said I've got
[3:02:44.100 --> 3:02:46.740]  people on my show claiming that the US government could attack them I thought
[3:02:46.740 --> 3:02:50.740]  they were crazy but this sounds it was in response to Eric Holder spying through
[3:02:50.740 --> 3:02:55.180]  the horizon on AP and the Associated Press. He you know flipped on this issue
[3:02:55.180 --> 3:02:58.020]  he's like you know what this does sound like to Ernie and I thought that was
[3:02:58.020 --> 3:03:01.020]  kind of interesting. So what you put that idea in his head and being an
[3:03:01.020 --> 3:03:04.660]  egomaniac like many of us are you couldn't say it in real time that you
[3:03:04.660 --> 3:03:08.100]  know you're right there was tyrannical things happening but two or three weeks
[3:03:08.100 --> 3:03:10.820]  later after it's in his head for a couple of months and he listens to things
[3:03:10.820 --> 3:03:13.660]  and he raises consciousness he's like you know what this does sound
[3:03:13.660 --> 3:03:19.100]  tyrannical. Yeah why can government have guns but we can't why am I penalized
[3:03:19.100 --> 3:03:24.100]  because I'm an individual and not wearing a monkey outfit. Well the gun
[3:03:24.100 --> 3:03:29.940]  issue as you know I have mixed feelings on it because I think that if there's
[3:03:29.940 --> 3:03:36.060]  gonna be gun ownership then it there should be a connection to identifying
[3:03:36.060 --> 3:03:41.180]  clear tyrannical threats and then acting on those threats. It seems to me that by
[3:03:41.180 --> 3:03:48.060]  not more acting more in a direct way the government is now doing things like I
[3:03:48.060 --> 3:03:52.100]  said that they would do. They are actively removing bullets from the
[3:03:52.100 --> 3:04:03.100]  marketplace by buying all these bullets. Yeah no you said that years ago probably gave me an idea. You're probably doing it. No but the issue is if we don't have a culture of guns we're
[3:04:03.100 --> 3:04:07.100]  slaves. If men don't know how to use weapons and specialists know how to use
[3:04:07.100 --> 3:04:10.660]  them the people that know how to use them are the kings and those that don't
[3:04:10.660 --> 3:04:14.100]  know how to use them are the slaves. It's like that with any animal. I don't say
[3:04:14.100 --> 3:04:18.100]  we're an animal but I mean we're the super animal. But the headline you just
[3:04:18.100 --> 3:04:21.820]  read on Judge Report where the Verizon is doing a deal they're reading your mail
[3:04:21.820 --> 3:04:24.820]  they're collecting data Eric Holder's been compromised he's been corrupted
[3:04:24.820 --> 3:04:28.660]  Obama's compromised he's corrupted. There's no my point is that people say
[3:04:28.660 --> 3:04:32.340]  well if tyranny ever happens we're gonna take our guns and we're gonna take our
[3:04:32.340 --> 3:04:35.620]  government back. Well tyranny we've had tyranny now we've had example after
[3:04:35.620 --> 3:04:39.100]  example of example. No no I hear you I hear you so you're like you're like the
[3:04:39.100 --> 3:04:44.100]  second time it's for this you haven't used it so why do you have it. But it
[3:04:44.100 --> 3:04:48.940]  doesn't mean we lose it just because because discretion is the greater
[3:04:48.940 --> 3:04:54.060]  part of valor. Hey folks live coverage tomorrow 11 a.m. Central info wars dot
