[00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:23.309]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.851]  The swamp was absolutely horrified in D.C.
[00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:38.187]  They've had 11 hearings that I know of, where they lie about yours truly and the First Amendment, and then call for the banning of conservatives, nationalists, and patriots across the board.
[00:00:38.187 --> 00:00:40.549]  So I went and spoke at the press conference.
[00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:47.014]  I went where the press goes to speak to the different senators, so I could face my accusers.
[00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:50.237]  And the corporate media spun it like I was being disruptive.
[00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:52.979]  Meanwhile, we have video and photos on Infowars.com.
[00:00:55.194 --> 00:01:06.644]  Of George Soros groups, known people that work for Soros, paying the disruptors cash in the parking lot and then video and photos of the disruptors, which is well known.
[00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:10.548]  I caught a leftist Soros Bloomberg funded group 17 years ago.
[00:01:10.548 --> 00:01:11.128]  No, 18 years ago.
[00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:12.790]  It was in 2000.
[00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.750]  Paying $400 to two young black men.
[00:01:20.373 --> 00:01:24.014]  To go in and act like gangbangers in front of the Texas Legislature.
[00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:24.954]  And we caught him.
[00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:27.974]  There was an Ethics Committee hearing about it.
[00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:32.375]  Kenna Hose, the head of the committee, got in trouble for it.
[00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:43.397]  So I show up, when I was in the front of USA Today, concerning Jack Dorsey making the personal decision not to ban me, and Dorsey denying it.
[00:01:43.397 --> 00:01:49.138]  The main topic of the hearings, quote, fake news, and censorship,
[00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:53.176]  And the media acts like I'm weird even showing up.
[00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:55.298]  That's the level of their deception.
[00:01:55.298 --> 00:02:07.652]  Now the big news obviously is Trump says snakes are everywhere and clearly this fake New York Times situation is a composite of different leakers written by a professional writer.
[00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:10.327]  At the New York Times.
[00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:14.048]  It is a thing of fiction.
[00:02:14.048 --> 00:02:16.529]  They are not the resistance, we are the resistance.
[00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:22.272]  Trump is the proud, daring lion amongst the hyenas.
[00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:27.835]  He's helped turn the country around to a 4.6% growth rate projected.
[00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:31.837]  Now currently 4.2, but the new number is going to be 4.6, even the Federal Reserve says.
[00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.643]  He's proven they were artificially suppressing us.
[00:02:35.643 --> 00:02:38.125]  And so he's surrounded by traitors.
[00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:51.453]  He's surrounded by cowards because the Deep State, FBI, and leftist CIA is harassing and bullying and threatening everyone using serious Cold War spy tactics.
[00:02:51.453 --> 00:02:52.434]  And believe me, I know.
[00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:54.676]  I had stuff happen in D.C.
[00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:56.437]  and this is the big takeaway.
[00:02:57.628 --> 00:03:03.654]  That is directly out of a spy novel, and I'm talking to lawyers, a bunch of other people about what I'm gonna do.
[00:03:03.654 --> 00:03:10.680]  It'll either be today or tomorrow I talk about it for my own safety, but it is next level.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.766]  But Mueller is planning to try to frame me, indict me, and then I believe kill me ahead of
[00:03:19.403 --> 00:03:23.766]  Then being able to actually have their kangaroo trial.
[00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.047]  That's their plan.
[00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:26.889]  They've already tried to kill Stone twice.
[00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.591]  So this is big league, folks.
[00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.113]  It doesn't get any more big league than this.
[00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:41.100]  And when they saw that they're totally blind politically, that I could show up anywhere I want and take over.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:49.006]  When they saw how they've taken me and built me into Godzilla to frighten the left with, that now when I show up, I am Godzilla.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.903]  And so now they're in full panic mode, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:03.248]  And this is total political warfare where they're saying kill conservative leaders, kill the president, kill their families, kill everybody.
[00:04:03.248 --> 00:04:04.889]  They're the ones coming after us.
[00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.410]  They're the ones that want violence.
[00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.310]  And 61 days out.
[00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:11.672]  What did we tell you they'd do?
[00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:15.774]  What does this resistance article in the New York Times owned by the Mexican Kingpin say?
[00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:16.894]  Oh yeah, you're the resistance.
[00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:26.880]  You got the courts, you got the Hollywood, you got the big banks, you got the chi-coms, you got all the media, all the establishment media, demonizing this great president.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.460]  And what do they say?
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:35.124]  They say 25th Amendment, and what do you have Bernstein and Woodward, all of them are saying, remove him, remove him, remove him!
[00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:36.364]  He's doing a terrible job!
[00:04:38.897 --> 00:04:44.388]  The more they do this, the more we love him, so they just ratchet up now into open political warfare.
[00:04:45.353 --> 00:04:48.955]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:54.737]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:05:11.364 --> 00:05:16.189]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:26.058]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide water filtration for your entire home.
[00:05:26.338 --> 00:05:29.521]  Removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:39.110]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.197]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[00:05:46.577 --> 00:06:03.924]  Head to InfoWarStore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today.
[00:06:03.924 --> 00:06:06.585]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:11.767]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:28.210]  What we've done.
[00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:36.917]  So when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration, probably who's failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons.
[00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:37.637]  No.
[00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:39.299]  And the New York Times is failing.
[00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:50.588]  If I weren't here, I believe the New York Times probably wouldn't even exist.
[00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:56.373]  And someday when I'm not president, which hopefully will be in about six and a half years from now.
[00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:04.480]  The New York Times and CNN and all of these phony media outlets will be out of business, folks.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.922]  They'll be out of business because there'll be nothing to write and there'll be nothing of interest.
[00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:13.545]  So nobody has done what this administration has done.
[00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:17.707]  And I agree, it's different from an agenda, which is much different than ours.
[00:07:17.707 --> 00:07:19.949]  And it's certainly not your agenda that I can tell you.
[00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.812]  It's about open borders.
[00:07:22.812 --> 00:07:25.716]  It's about letting people flee into our country.
[00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:28.599]  It's about a disaster and crime for our country.
[00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:33.465]  So they don't like Donald Trump and I don't like them because they're very dishonest people.
[00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:36.389]  Remember this also about the New York Times.
[00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:42.915]  When I won, they were forced to apologize to their subscribers.
[00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:44.997]  They wrote a letter of apology.
[00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:52.023]  It was the first time anybody's ever done it because they covered the election incorrectly.
[00:07:52.023 --> 00:07:56.407]  So if the failing New York Times has an anonymous editorial, can you believe it?
[00:07:56.407 --> 00:08:00.751]  Anonymous, meaning gutless, a gutless editorial.
[00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:01.752]  We're doing a great job.
[00:08:02.452 --> 00:08:04.074]  The poll numbers are through the roof.
[00:08:04.074 --> 00:08:05.595]  Our poll numbers are great.
[00:08:05.595 --> 00:08:06.296]  And guess what?
[00:08:06.296 --> 00:08:11.340]  Nobody is going to come close to beating me in 2020 because of what we've done.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:17.205]  We've done more than anybody ever thought possible in it's not even two years.
[00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:18.166]  So thank you very much.
[00:08:40.942 --> 00:08:45.684]  Now only 61 days to the most important election in world history.
[00:08:45.684 --> 00:08:54.108]  And I look at Trump, that bull, that lion, surrounded by all the heinous and all the liars and all the scum like Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:56.039 --> 00:09:06.573]  Robert Mueller, dishonorable, evil, wicked people with so many crimes, so many wars, so many child kidnapping rings, so much narcotics trafficking under their belt.
[00:09:06.573 --> 00:09:09.998]  And you see Trump out there with all his morals, all his strength.
[00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:22.905]  It's like a North Star to bring this country back and they put out all these lies and all this propaganda to try to turn you against him as they push for the 25th Amendment to be implemented to remove him now before the midterms.
[00:09:22.905 --> 00:09:25.267]  Because Kavanaugh is going to get confirmed.
[00:09:25.267 --> 00:09:31.070]  And there's going to be a huge red wave despite the election fraud and all the people voting in the names of dead people.
[00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:36.233]  And they're now in full panic mode.
[00:09:36.233 --> 00:09:38.514]  But I got to tell you, I can't talk about it yet.
[00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:52.633]  But undoubtedly, the most insane thing happened to me yesterday that is like nothing you've ever seen in a movie concerning Russiagate.
[00:09:52.633 --> 00:10:02.656]  But I already knew what they were doing to everybody's families around Trump and the intimidation and the threats, but it is just unbelievable.
[00:10:02.656 --> 00:10:07.077]  And I got calls into law firms, I got a bunch of other stuff going on, but believe me,
[00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:14.475]  If Mueller thinks that I'm not going to release all this, he's got another thing coming.
[00:10:14.475 --> 00:10:16.837]  You guys are crazy!
[00:10:16.837 --> 00:10:19.258]  And it shows that they are going for broke.
[00:10:19.258 --> 00:10:21.319]  They are mad dog.
[00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:30.684]  I mean, that guy on screen, if you're a TV viewer, delivered uranium to the Russians for Hillary to do uranium transfers of 25% of our uranium.
[00:10:30.684 --> 00:10:32.465]  And then he tells us that Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:48.673]  And because they're the globalists that sold the country out, and because they're the outside power that hates flyover country, that says America was never great, will never be great, because they want the economy to plunge, Bill Maher, you've heard them.
[00:10:48.673 --> 00:11:01.858]  Because of that, they've got to say, we're all Russian agents, so that they have a way to overthrow Trump, overthrow the 2016 election, and have federally, globally controlled elections, where we never have real elections again.
[00:11:03.214 --> 00:11:06.336]  America was on its deathbed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:06.336 --> 00:11:23.644]  So, despite all the epic stuff that happened yesterday at the hearings, and the Rubio situation, and me confronting the head CNN thought police officer, Oliver Darcy, who admittedly goes around and runs the banning of major sites like Infowars and others.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.781]  Off of major platforms.
[00:11:26.781 --> 00:11:29.442]  He sat there to my face and said, none of that's happening.
[00:11:29.442 --> 00:11:40.127]  So let's pull up 10 or 15 of the articles here, where he was calling for me to not have my book published and calling for folks to take me down off Twitter and saying, look, he's violating your rules, take him down.
[00:11:40.127 --> 00:11:41.767]  And then him getting credit for it.
[00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:46.109]  And he sat there right into the camera and said, nope, no one's taking you off.
[00:11:46.109 --> 00:11:47.510]  I'm not involved.
[00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.091]  No.
[00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:53.853]  The total disrespect for the truth, total arrogance, total inversion of reality.
[00:11:56.906 --> 00:12:00.687]  So that's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:00.687 --> 00:12:06.988]  Now, they've had 11 hearings that I know of.
[00:12:06.988 --> 00:12:20.830]  I'm always finding new ones in the last year and a half, saying I'm a Russian agent, I'm a racist, I'm fake news, that I say nobody died at Parkland in Florida, never said that.
[00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.431]  You know, they can, out of context, twist that on the Sandy Hook.
[00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.171]  So what are they going to do?
[00:12:30.171 --> 00:12:32.832]  They're going to frame me for being a Russian.
[00:12:32.832 --> 00:12:34.173]  And that's what they're planning to do.
[00:12:34.173 --> 00:12:36.134]  100% confirmed.
[00:12:36.134 --> 00:12:39.276]  They tried to do it to me yesterday.
[00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:43.238]  And I was just poleaxed.
[00:12:43.238 --> 00:12:46.319]  I mean, I couldn't believe the nature of it.
[00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:50.361]  And the folks that did this, they don't think I'm not going to go public?
[00:12:50.361 --> 00:12:53.763]  I mean, oh yeah, let that fuse be lit.
[00:12:53.763 --> 00:12:55.524]  Psss, politically.
[00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:57.425]  You don't know when that's going to go sky high, do you?
[00:12:59.039 --> 00:13:02.762]  Probably in the next three hours.
[00:13:02.762 --> 00:13:06.684]  So, like I said, I don't know how this is all going to end, but you want to fight?
[00:13:06.684 --> 00:13:09.326]  You better believe you got one.
[00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:10.787]  Because D.C.
[00:13:10.787 --> 00:13:18.032]  is full of a bunch of cowards and a bunch of followers and a bunch of people intimidated by thugs on top.
[00:13:18.032 --> 00:13:20.393]  And Trump's been watching it all his life and sick of it.
[00:13:20.393 --> 00:13:23.856]  And he thought he could go turn the country around.
[00:13:23.856 --> 00:13:26.177]  Wouldn't be hard because they were artificially bleeding it on purpose.
[00:13:26.177 --> 00:13:26.698]  That's admitted.
[00:13:27.566 --> 00:13:28.386]  If you have the courage.
[00:13:28.386 --> 00:13:29.967]  The hard part is the courage to be attacked.
[00:13:29.967 --> 00:13:36.630]  But if you can just get in there and follow basic Americana free market, we'll be the richest country in the world like we always were.
[00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.631]  We got the right stuff.
[00:13:38.631 --> 00:13:40.952]  I got something.
[00:13:40.952 --> 00:13:42.513]  And it's super bad.
[00:13:42.513 --> 00:13:46.595]  I got something that tells me what to do.
[00:13:46.595 --> 00:13:49.296]  So, we're here.
[00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:51.237]  This is the fight for America.
[00:13:51.237 --> 00:13:53.077]  This is the globalist attack.
[00:13:53.077 --> 00:13:53.918]  This is going on.
[00:13:55.396 --> 00:13:56.857]  Everyone should choose a side.
[00:13:56.857 --> 00:14:01.680]  Most people that serve the system, near the top, do it out of abject fear.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.521]  They do it because they're threatened into it.
[00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:07.904]  They do it because they live lives of fear and insecurity.
[00:14:07.904 --> 00:14:23.934]  And it's all done in the name of the country, but what they really mean is, it's done in the name of the corrupt organizations and groups that have hijacked this nation.
[00:14:23.934 --> 00:14:24.635]  And they have total
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.061]  The stain for you and your family.
[00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:35.888]  It's like the Oliver Darcy guy, who has some of the most evil, but not evil in a powerful way, like the most pathetic, dishonest eyes.
[00:14:35.888 --> 00:14:44.035]  They just ooze betrayal and weakness and just a very effeminate type of evil.
[00:14:44.035 --> 00:14:47.899]  But it's not effeminate, it has that twistedness when it's in a man's eyes.
[00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:51.242]  And just someone totally turned over.
[00:14:52.721 --> 00:14:59.686]  To deception, going, I never said take you off, no one ever took you off, you've not been taken off anything.
[00:14:59.686 --> 00:15:04.690]  Just that enjoyment, like Marco Rubio said, you don't exist, I don't know who you are.
[00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:13.876]  As if denying I exist gives him some power, that's what they do.
[00:15:13.876 --> 00:15:16.318]  Only other person that looks more evil is Brian Scalter.
[00:15:17.346 --> 00:15:18.967]  And then you ask, why do they hire these guys?
[00:15:18.967 --> 00:15:20.667]  Because that's who they are!
[00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:23.468]  The executives like it!

[00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:31.051]  We come back, I'm gonna get to the fake New York Times article.
[00:15:31.051 --> 00:15:32.092]  People say, who is the source?
[00:15:32.092 --> 00:15:34.953]  It's a composite made up of the New York Times, as I said last night.
[00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:48.431]  And it's just a bunch of cowards who've been in and out of the administration who get threatened by Mueller and everybody, and their wives get threatened, and so they roll over like dogs and show their bellies.

[00:20:18.075 --> 00:20:28.780]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:38.564]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.564 --> 00:20:43.507]  Fortune favors the bold, and the fortune I seek is liberty from my family and your family.
[00:20:45.422 --> 00:20:48.184]  I am so honored to stand with President Trump.
[00:20:48.184 --> 00:20:51.306]  The stamina, the energy, how smart he is.
[00:20:51.306 --> 00:20:55.708]  And then you read the news and it's he's weak, he's stupid, he's racist, he's bad.
[00:20:55.708 --> 00:20:58.370]  He hates Southerners.
[00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.251]  But no tapes of any of it.
[00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:05.094]  All complete garbage.
[00:21:05.094 --> 00:21:08.536]  And the lies get more elaborate, more insane, more out of control.
[00:21:08.536 --> 00:21:09.677]  And here's the takeaway.
[00:21:11.152 --> 00:21:12.573]  We're 61 days out.
[00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:14.013]  They know they're going to lose the midterms.
[00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:15.394]  All the internal polls show it.
[00:21:15.394 --> 00:21:17.495]  They've got bots that can track it all.
[00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:19.536]  Not the fake polls.
[00:21:19.536 --> 00:21:21.857]  And they know the Democratic Party has lost the people.
[00:21:21.857 --> 00:21:24.618]  A total political realignment's happened.
[00:21:24.618 --> 00:21:30.241]  Normally when that happens, then the new one party splits into a couple more.
[00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:31.582]  Or into a second party.
[00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:39.417]  When they know that, they want to ban the election, hold new ones that are staged, and then split the Democratic Party into two new parties.
[00:21:39.417 --> 00:21:42.419]  A Communist wing and a Socialist wing.
[00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:49.002]  That's what you see happening with the Democratic Party right now and all these Socialist and Communist winning primaries.
[00:21:49.002 --> 00:21:50.822]  And they admit in their white papers they're doing this.
[00:21:50.822 --> 00:21:52.943]  People say, how does he know all this?
[00:21:52.943 --> 00:21:56.105]  Because I actually read this instead of watching football and baseball.
[00:21:57.904 --> 00:21:59.825]  I'm not saying you're bad if you want to watch football.
[00:21:59.825 --> 00:22:03.868]  I'm not saying you don't... I kind of want to go down and see a Houston Astros game or whatever.
[00:22:03.868 --> 00:22:12.394]  The point is, is that I can't do it because we're in a total war.
[00:22:12.394 --> 00:22:16.457]  So, I cannot hype enough to you.
[00:22:16.457 --> 00:22:19.880]  I don't have words to describe to you how dire the situation is.
[00:22:20.936 --> 00:22:23.278]  This country's on an emergency operating table.
[00:22:23.278 --> 00:22:24.759]  Our hearts stopped.
[00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:34.305]  You, the listeners of this broadcast, InfoWars, President Trump, DrugsReport.com, are the literal defibrillators that started the heart back.
[00:22:34.305 --> 00:22:35.446]  And they said, oh, you're dead.
[00:22:35.446 --> 00:22:36.407]  Well, now we're sewed up.
[00:22:36.407 --> 00:22:37.207]  We're walking around.
[00:22:37.207 --> 00:22:40.069]  We're on a walker.
[00:22:40.069 --> 00:22:41.390]  But we can get a lot better.
[00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:43.572]  And they're like, no, no, no, lay back down, lay back down.
[00:22:43.572 --> 00:22:48.475]  And they want to have you lay down and inject you with a lethal injection, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:52.065 --> 00:22:53.526]  They want the control.
[00:22:53.526 --> 00:22:58.790]  We have the audiotapes of them saying bitter clingers and they hate Christians and saying it publicly.
[00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.252]  We have them cheering, America was never great, it'll never be great.
[00:23:02.252 --> 00:23:04.013]  We have them saying they want a depression.
[00:23:04.013 --> 00:23:09.196]  We have Silicon Valley that I told you 10 years ago is building giant bunkers in New Zealand.
[00:23:09.196 --> 00:23:12.098]  And they had the media attack me 10 years ago.
[00:23:12.098 --> 00:23:16.581]  Jones claims the elite are moving to New Zealand and building bunkers.
[00:23:16.581 --> 00:23:21.705]  I was told it by a gentleman who builds dams around the world, who's very rich.
[00:23:23.892 --> 00:23:28.516]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:23:28.516 --> 00:23:39.324]  Who said they're planning something big, they're doing major projects that are 50 million, 100 million, 200 million dollar projects in New Zealand.
[00:23:39.324 --> 00:23:41.645]  For in case of a societal complete breakdown.
[00:23:41.645 --> 00:23:44.968]  Of course, they're engineering it!
[00:23:44.968 --> 00:23:47.550]  Next Decade's News today, Bloomberg this week.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.841]  The super rich of Silicon Valley have a doomsday escape plan.
[00:23:52.841 --> 00:24:01.965]  Exactly what I told you!
[00:24:01.965 --> 00:24:03.785]  That's why they want me off the air, folks.
[00:24:03.785 --> 00:24:09.407]  Not because I'm fake news, but because I'm real news.
[00:24:09.407 --> 00:24:17.971]  And they realize that I can go anywhere I want and take over the media.
[00:24:17.971 --> 00:24:18.631]  And they can't stand it.
[00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.251]  And they know that our numbers went up when they banned us.
[00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:23.992]  They can't stand that.
[00:24:23.992 --> 00:24:29.276]  And so I'm telling you, they're making their move on me, because they're making their move on you.
[00:24:29.276 --> 00:24:47.907]  If you want to pull up the article from like eight, nine years ago, and there's more, just type in Hollywood elite moving to New Zealand, Infowars.com, or James Cameron moves to New Zealand to avoid bioweapon release.
[00:24:49.215 --> 00:24:50.736]  That's the real reason.
[00:24:50.736 --> 00:24:59.020]  See, there's a leftist global plan that once they collapse the third world and scare the first world enough, they're going to let in enough to create political division.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.402]  About 100 million in Europe, 100 million in the U.S.
[00:25:01.402 --> 00:25:02.923]  Then they're going to build giant walls.
[00:25:02.923 --> 00:25:06.685]  Trump isn't part of this because he's doing it early to stop the crisis.
[00:25:06.685 --> 00:25:09.266]  They're going to build the walls later.
[00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:13.248]  Bring in total biometric control and a police state to counter the collapsing third world.
[00:25:13.248 --> 00:25:17.851]  And then they're going to release a bioweapon that's going to wipe out
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:30.306]  The first round, two or three billion people, and then once they get a real hyper-police state in after that, then they'll deliver the true superweapons.
[00:25:30.306 --> 00:25:36.850]  And then they will retire to their labyrinthine palaces while we kill each other.
[00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.552]  But they've got to have automated
[00:25:42.697 --> 00:26:09.987]  Military forces and drone forces to carry out suppression and mop-ups for some computer models they've got that human directed forces and by that people directed for a pro-human future would be able to basically understand the plan even once it was launched and then run a countervailing system that would then remove the planetary cleansing operation that they are preparing.
[00:26:11.075 --> 00:26:20.377]  So, the real reason I'm verboten is because there is a planetary cleansing operation prepared to reduce world population by 99%.
[00:26:20.377 --> 00:26:30.559]  They tell university students 80% but you're part of the elite 20% they're going to save the earth because you're an environmentalist, you're anti-human, you're anti-god, you'll be part of the priest class.
[00:26:30.559 --> 00:26:34.959]  Because, you know, they don't tell them it's 99%, they can do the math knowing they're going to be killed as well.
[00:26:34.959 --> 00:26:38.160]  So tell low-level folks at the first entry level we're going to kill 80%.
[00:26:41.209 --> 00:26:43.051]  Then at higher levels, they say, well, it's actually 90%.
[00:26:43.051 --> 00:27:08.633]  And then at the highest levels, they say 99%, except one level above that, the final level, because there's always a hidden level, they say, actually, our God tells us we must transcend humans and merge the silicon, and that humans are actually a curse to the universe, and that our God will only let us ascend to Godhood once the human race has been completely eradicated.
[00:27:09.793 --> 00:27:12.935]  And that is the, they believe, the interdimensional transmission they're receiving.
[00:27:12.935 --> 00:27:13.996]  Of course, we are in deep space.
[00:27:13.996 --> 00:27:16.197]  That does sound quite like a plan, doesn't it?
[00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:28.104]  But regardless, that's what they believe, and they're building the plan for Lucifer, and Lucifer plans to kill, steal, and destroy, and if God doesn't intervene, there will not be any flesh spared.
[00:27:28.104 --> 00:27:31.587]  Revelation.
[00:27:31.587 --> 00:27:38.431]  So, you need to understand that they are going to kill you and your family for sure.
[00:27:39.545 --> 00:27:40.386]  If they have their way.
[00:27:40.386 --> 00:27:45.550]  And you have to understand that, why is Elon Musk having his company destroyed and sabotaged?
[00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:51.335]  They literally have people in there, I knew this six months ago but now it's confirmed, blowing up stuff in his plant.
[00:27:51.335 --> 00:27:54.618]  Because he's been in these meetings and said, I don't want to be part of it, and he's come out and told you.
[00:27:54.618 --> 00:28:01.643]  Beware of those that worship AI gods, they plan to get rid of everybody by 2050, it's a nightmare plan, oh my god humanity please wake up.
[00:28:01.643 --> 00:28:04.266]  And now his company is to be destroyed.
[00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:06.768]  They're like, hey dude, we let you in the club and you said no.
[00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:15.260]  Now we're going to slowly destroy you, and discredit you everywhere, and that's why you see them doing that.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.261]  It's how it works.
[00:28:17.261 --> 00:28:22.524]  And so, at the end of the day, none of these globalists are going to make it out of this.
[00:28:22.524 --> 00:28:25.546]  Whatever it is they're building will kill everybody in the end.
[00:28:25.546 --> 00:28:36.612]  There won't be one Luciferian person left, if they succeed this program, standing there in this system, supposedly going to merge with some Silicon God and ascend, and they're going to be deceived, of course, in the end.
[00:28:38.339 --> 00:28:41.262]  That's how it works.
[00:28:41.262 --> 00:28:41.842]  And that's it.
[00:28:41.842 --> 00:28:43.864]  You're not living in a science fiction book.
[00:28:43.864 --> 00:28:46.427]  You're living on a planet in deep space, baby.
[00:28:46.427 --> 00:28:48.388]  Orbiting a standard sun.
[00:28:48.388 --> 00:28:50.290]  And you're living in the future.
[00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.351]  And it's here.
[00:28:51.351 --> 00:28:55.355]  And you're facing a satanic interdimensional attack.
[00:29:00.346 --> 00:29:02.088]  Let's talk tough.
[00:29:02.088 --> 00:29:03.489]  Let's talk comfort.
[00:29:03.489 --> 00:29:05.871]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[00:29:05.871 --> 00:29:10.814]  Made in the USA blue jeans like you wore as a kid.
[00:29:10.814 --> 00:29:11.715]  Remember?
[00:29:11.715 --> 00:29:20.362]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:29:20.362 --> 00:29:23.865]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:29:23.865 --> 00:29:26.467]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:29:28.607 --> 00:29:33.291]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:35.913]  Blue diamond gusset's got it.
[00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.252]  For good old-fashioned comfort, get Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:29:41.252 --> 00:29:42.753]  Every stitch guaranteed.
[00:29:42.753 --> 00:29:46.015]  In our Defender motorcycle jean comes Kevlar reinforced.

[00:29:49.737 --> 00:29:50.118]  Others don't.
[00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:19.069]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[00:30:19.409 --> 00:30:20.189]  The revolution.

[00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:22.301]  I got it!
[00:33:22.301 --> 00:33:24.302]  Watch me!
[00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:25.623]  I got it!
[00:33:25.623 --> 00:33:27.203]  Hey!
[00:33:27.203 --> 00:33:30.725]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[00:33:30.725 --> 00:33:31.945]  I got something that
[00:33:44.735 --> 00:33:46.735]  I'm super bad.
[00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:48.496]  I got something.
[00:33:48.496 --> 00:33:52.817]  Now I got a move that tells me what to do.
[00:33:52.817 --> 00:33:55.597]  Sometimes I do.
[00:33:55.597 --> 00:34:00.479]  Now I got a move that tells me what to do.
[00:34:00.479 --> 00:34:05.860]  Sometimes I feel so nice, I wanna try myself a few.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.000]  I got something.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.960]  I'm super bad.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.121]  Super bad.
[00:34:09.121 --> 00:34:10.821]  Bobby Stone in the house.
[00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:18.996]  We'll be right back with him in a moment.
[00:34:18.996 --> 00:34:22.039]  I'm going to say this again.
[00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:24.481]  I'm going to say it very, very slowly because I know the audience gets it.
[00:34:24.481 --> 00:34:34.570]  What horrifies the bureaucrats seeing in the New York Times is Obama openly set up a CIA office in the last Defense Authorization Act.
[00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.133]  I know you're like, Alex, you say this every day.
[00:34:37.133 --> 00:34:37.953]  I know.
[00:34:37.953 --> 00:34:38.554]  For two years.
[00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:50.795]  Because that's how they're funding and doing all this, and they're using spies training reporters how to intimidate and threaten people.
[00:34:50.795 --> 00:34:56.398]  And then they've got a rogue group in the FBI and Justice Department running around terrorizing everyone, and we're going to get to that.
[00:34:56.398 --> 00:35:05.224]  And they're going and threatening people that they need to set up me and Roger Stone or they're going to go to prison.
[00:35:05.224 --> 00:35:06.725]  They have gone into criminal
[00:35:08.118 --> 00:35:09.459]  Overdrive.
[00:35:09.459 --> 00:35:15.642]  And they're doing things so criminal, it's like when a bank robber gets caught and he grabs a little girl and puts a gun to their head.
[00:35:15.642 --> 00:35:20.205]  I mean, they're at the gun to the head thing going, get back, get back, get back!
[00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:25.948]  And then there's Trump, totally competent, kicking butt, economy coming back, all these great things.
[00:35:25.948 --> 00:35:27.789]  And they are saying, remove him.
[00:35:27.789 --> 00:35:30.951]  And this is meant to make him totally paranoid, this fake New York Times piece.
[00:35:30.951 --> 00:35:36.274]  Yes, obviously, it's Nikki Haley is one of the main sources and one of his former lawyers, but it's a composite.
[00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:42.093]  Professionally written by the New York Times, there's Inesh D'Souza.
[00:35:42.093 --> 00:35:44.335]  And others have said.
[00:35:44.335 --> 00:35:47.957]  The kingpin-owned New York Times is not the resistance.
[00:35:47.957 --> 00:35:49.218]  We're the resistance.
[00:35:49.218 --> 00:35:50.860]  We're the ones being deplatformed.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.301]  We're the ones under siege.
[00:35:52.301 --> 00:35:54.463]  Trump's the one under attack.
[00:35:54.463 --> 00:35:57.565]  And you just crack the door to letting us in.
[00:35:57.565 --> 00:35:58.706]  And everything gets better.
[00:35:58.706 --> 00:36:04.851]  Because baby, we believe in America.
[00:36:04.851 --> 00:36:05.992]  I'm in the cult of America.
[00:36:11.144 --> 00:36:12.264]  And you can feel it.
[00:36:12.264 --> 00:36:14.725]  She's in a lot of trouble right now.
[00:36:14.725 --> 00:36:18.945]  And so I, I'm not scared at all.
[00:36:18.945 --> 00:36:23.766]  I've got a mentally know that whatever happens, God's going to take care of my children.
[00:36:23.766 --> 00:36:31.388]  And you get to the point where you got to tell your kids, like I took them to school this morning.
[00:36:31.388 --> 00:36:32.948]  Someday your daddy's not going to be here.
[00:36:32.948 --> 00:36:36.749]  You just need to be good people and be strong and stick up for each other.
[00:36:36.749 --> 00:36:37.209]  Do what's right.
[00:36:41.479 --> 00:36:49.825]  Well, you're already starting to say bye to your kids.
[00:36:49.825 --> 00:36:52.267]  You know how close you are to midnight, folks.
[00:36:52.267 --> 00:36:52.748]  But you know what?
[00:36:52.748 --> 00:37:02.175]  It makes me want to do it even more, because we're facing true, unadulterated, pure evil.
[00:37:02.175 --> 00:37:03.176]  Pure.
[00:37:03.176 --> 00:37:04.717]  That has a will to dominate us.
[00:37:04.717 --> 00:37:05.137]  Well, you know what?
[00:37:05.137 --> 00:37:05.858]  I have a will to be free.
[00:37:08.479 --> 00:37:16.265]  And the stuff going on behind the scenes I'm going to reveal soon is beyond anything you've ever heard of in the Soviet Union.
[00:37:16.265 --> 00:37:24.231]  And the fact that these people get away with this in impunity makes me love Trump even more and love you even more and what we've done together is so beautiful.
[00:37:24.231 --> 00:37:30.075]  I was in the halls of Congress and they have these professional agitators that have been caught being paid by Soros and the Democrats disrupt everything.
[00:37:30.075 --> 00:37:32.177]  And they'll come over and you go, oh God, here comes a zombie.
[00:37:32.177 --> 00:37:34.439]  Because they could be black, they could be white, they could be Hispanic.
[00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:35.900]  They look like somebody sucked their soul out.
[00:37:36.909 --> 00:37:39.650]  The Romans are always hanging at their side.
[00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.431]  They'll just scream out stupid stuff.
[00:37:42.431 --> 00:37:43.371]  And you try to talk to them.
[00:37:43.371 --> 00:37:44.152]  They can't even talk.
[00:37:44.152 --> 00:37:47.113]  And then you see everybody else groveling to the political class.
[00:37:47.113 --> 00:37:49.614]  And it's like, everyone's afraid of this.
[00:37:49.614 --> 00:37:51.214]  This is what's hijacked our country.
[00:37:51.214 --> 00:37:52.475]  This is shameful.
[00:37:52.475 --> 00:37:54.435]  This is dishonorable.
[00:37:54.435 --> 00:37:58.097]  We have a pack of criminals in Washington.
[00:37:58.097 --> 00:37:59.277]  And they have the nerve then.
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.344]  To say that Trump's a liar and Trump doesn't stand for anything?
[00:38:06.344 --> 00:38:08.407]  All Trump's done is deliver on what he said he would do.
[00:38:08.407 --> 00:38:09.529]  He's neurotic about it!
[00:38:18.393 --> 00:38:19.794]  They wanted Trump out by last December.
[00:38:19.794 --> 00:38:20.194]  They failed.
[00:38:20.194 --> 00:38:22.156]  They want him out in the next 61 days.
[00:38:22.156 --> 00:38:22.676]  They admit it.
[00:38:22.676 --> 00:38:23.277]  25th Amendment.
[00:38:23.277 --> 00:38:25.499]  It's all in this fake New York Times piece.
[00:38:25.499 --> 00:38:27.040]  Meant to make Trump paranoid.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.841]  Meant to make him go crazy.
[00:38:28.841 --> 00:38:31.563]  I watched him bounding around on C-SPAN last night.
[00:38:31.563 --> 00:38:32.784]  He's totally energized.
[00:38:32.784 --> 00:38:34.325]  He's a fighter like me.
[00:38:34.325 --> 00:38:35.767]  Like Roger Stone.
[00:38:35.767 --> 00:38:37.188]  Roger and I have never been more alive.
[00:38:38.151 --> 00:38:39.772]  Trump's never been more alive.
[00:38:39.772 --> 00:38:40.293]  Look at him.
[00:38:40.293 --> 00:38:42.194]  That's a lion right there on your screen.
[00:38:42.194 --> 00:38:50.241]  I am so thankful to God and my ancestors that I'm an honorable person and that I knew in my gut to line up with that guy right there.
[00:38:50.241 --> 00:38:54.745]  And I tell you, wherever this train's going, I'm on it.
[00:38:54.745 --> 00:38:56.006]  And everybody knows it.
[00:38:56.006 --> 00:38:58.388]  And Trump's gaining in the polls, even the fake ones.
[00:38:58.388 --> 00:39:02.191]  We're breaking their corrupt will right now, and you're about to see their maximum push.
[00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:08.665]  But I think if the Democrats in Deep State get their hands on a nuke, they're going to try to nuke Trump.
[00:39:08.665 --> 00:39:10.646]  I think more and more that's what they're going to do.
[00:39:10.646 --> 00:39:12.988]  Or crash the stock market.
[00:39:12.988 --> 00:39:17.272]  Because they want to crash it before they kill him, or remove him, or drug him.
[00:39:17.272 --> 00:39:19.513]  They could give him something to make him, you know, have a heart attack too.
[00:39:19.513 --> 00:39:21.615]  I just pray for President Trump.
[00:39:21.615 --> 00:39:22.496]  Pray for him for us.
[00:39:22.496 --> 00:39:24.037]  Pray for Roger Stone.
[00:39:24.037 --> 00:39:26.159]  And get great products you need.
[00:39:26.159 --> 00:39:27.720]  I need you to go buy t-shirts.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.902]  I need you to sign up for auto ship on fish oil.
[00:39:31.718 --> 00:39:45.318]  Tumeric and all the other great products at Infowarslife.com and you stood with us this long and we're going to continue to move forward despite the attacks but I can tell you watching the cowardice of other people, not our audience, but the cowardice of other people.
[00:39:47.563 --> 00:39:50.606]  In the political system, trying to keep their heads down.
[00:39:50.606 --> 00:39:53.088]  We're losing everything because we kept our heads down.
[00:39:53.088 --> 00:39:55.951]  And thank God we got somebody like Trump to champion it.
[00:39:55.951 --> 00:40:00.455]  So whether it's Brain Force, or whether it's any of these great products, they're 40-50% off.
[00:40:00.455 --> 00:40:04.238]  The Labor Day special's gonna go until tomorrow, and then we've got to end it.
[00:40:04.238 --> 00:40:13.286]  There'll be some new specials, but whether it's colloidal silver iodine fortified toothpaste, fluoride free, whether it's the great ultimate turmeric formula, or whether it's the super silver
[00:40:14.207 --> 00:40:16.569]  Strongest over-the-counter silver out there.
[00:40:16.569 --> 00:40:18.030]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.052]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:22.053]  I would see our supporters.
[00:40:22.053 --> 00:40:23.414]  They had light in their eyes.
[00:40:23.414 --> 00:40:23.934]  Amazing.
[00:40:23.934 --> 00:40:26.956]  No matter what color they were, they had a spirit of goodness.
[00:40:26.956 --> 00:40:33.081]  And I'd see the enemy, and they were either these demonic power gods who were like crippled by their lust for power,
[00:40:34.511 --> 00:40:37.294]  Or they were like zombies, and it's just such an epic time.
[00:40:37.294 --> 00:40:46.804]  So Roger, I know you've been going through massive insanity and just major political assaults, Gestapo tactics, you name it, but let's talk about Trump right now.
[00:40:46.804 --> 00:40:51.809]  As we're about to go to break.
[00:40:51.809 --> 00:40:56.834]  Clearly, as you predicted a year ago, they're doing 25th Amendment, they're everywhere saying it, they're making their move.
[00:40:56.834 --> 00:40:57.175]  Do you agree?
[00:40:58.422 --> 00:41:03.624]  It's a classic example yet again of InfoWars having tomorrow's news today.
[00:41:03.624 --> 00:41:11.568]  We've been talking here at InfoWars about the 25th Amendment play by the Deep State and the two-party duopoly.
[00:41:11.568 --> 00:41:22.032]  The President, based on some early bad advice from his son-in-law and others, has put a number of Deep State quizlings right inside his administration.
[00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:41.413]  And it's possible, if this New York Times editorial isn't a total fraud, that it was written by Elaine Chao, for example, the red Chinese operative who was married to the Senate majority leader and who was the longest serving member of the George W. Bush cabinet.
[00:41:41.933 --> 00:41:44.634]  Why you would appoint such a person is an odd question.
[00:41:44.634 --> 00:41:55.498]  Or maybe it's John Huntsman, who openly trashed Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, but currently serves as our ambassador to, you guessed, Russia.
[00:41:55.498 --> 00:41:59.880]  No, I think that the soft coup is in full gear now.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.480]  This is why they're going after you.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:02.801]  It's why they're going after me.
[00:42:02.801 --> 00:42:04.561]  But we're not important.
[00:42:04.561 --> 00:42:08.603]  It's Donald Trump they're going after, and this bullet is aimed at his head.
[00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.792]  I say, rhetorically.
[00:42:11.792 --> 00:42:19.078]  And let's hope it's just rhetorically, because these people are hysterical, and there's no limits to what they might do.
[00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:26.884]  We're going to come back and get into how Trump should strike back and what he should do, but even a lot of globalists say, don't remove Trump, it'll blow up in their face.
[00:42:26.884 --> 00:42:31.488]  But I think they're so crazy, they're going to try to do it.
[00:42:31.488 --> 00:42:34.110]  It's entirely possible, Alex.
[00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.892]  They're like cornered rats now.
[00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:46.797]  With millions of new jobs and record economic growth, they see the handwriting on the wall and they're desperate to remove Trump before he totally revives the country.
[00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:47.117]  That's right.
[00:42:47.117 --> 00:42:49.099]  They've been running us in the ground by design.
[00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:51.082]  Now we've got the wheel partially away.
[00:42:51.082 --> 00:42:57.129]  Everybody can see we're steering out of the thunderstorm into beautiful blue skies and they are pissed to turn us back into hell.
[00:42:59.329 --> 00:43:00.670]  We knew it was coming.
[00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.112]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:16.385]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia, and then voila!
[00:43:16.385 --> 00:43:24.993]  Two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten
[00:43:25.333 --> 00:43:26.414]  News Feeds.

[00:43:52.433 --> 00:43:57.558]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[00:43:57.558 --> 00:43:59.319]  This is what they don't want you to see.

[00:47:33.965 --> 00:47:36.207]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:47:36.207 --> 00:47:49.740]  Coming up the next hour, I've got some of the amazing HD highlights of the press conferences and confronting the head of CNN, Secret Police Operations, who engages in thought crime detection and eradication.
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.542]  That means the First Amendment.
[00:47:51.542 --> 00:47:53.964]  Amazing stuff coming up next hour.
[00:47:53.964 --> 00:47:55.946]  A bunch of clips I haven't gotten to.
[00:47:55.946 --> 00:47:56.807]  A ton of other news.
[00:47:59.167 --> 00:48:00.768]  They're intensifying their lies.
[00:48:00.768 --> 00:48:08.471]  Roger, we were talking this morning how it's all been scripted the last few weeks with just Amorosa and then this and then that.
[00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:20.736]  Just one fake thing after the next and then we discover, okay, the witnesses say they didn't tell Bob Woodward this, but by then we're on to the next lie till it's just such a crescendo and you can see how it's all the same script.
[00:48:20.736 --> 00:48:21.757]  He's incompetent.
[00:48:21.757 --> 00:48:22.757]  He's a moron.
[00:48:22.757 --> 00:48:23.858]  He hates Southerners.
[00:48:23.858 --> 00:48:25.459]  He hates black people.
[00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:26.119]  He's a fake.
[00:48:27.455 --> 00:48:31.456]  But then if he's such an idiot, how'd he get elected and then how have things turned around?
[00:48:31.456 --> 00:48:40.858]  It's the same New York Times that told us that there was a 98% chance Hillary was going to win for two years.
[00:48:40.858 --> 00:48:45.358]  Yeah, you can see this as an orchestrated campaign to dominate the news cycle.
[00:48:45.358 --> 00:48:53.560]  So you had three days of Amorosa, five days of John McCain, which is kind of like, you know, at the beach with Bernie.
[00:48:54.586 --> 00:49:00.651]  Then you had the Woodward thing, but that didn't stay up there very long because it got knocked down so quickly.
[00:49:00.651 --> 00:49:05.095]  So now we have the phony New York Times anonymous editorial.
[00:49:05.095 --> 00:49:08.398]  By the way, I have an editorial coming up at Stone Cold Truth.
[00:49:08.398 --> 00:49:17.425]  It's anonymous, but it's from a senior official at the Clinton Foundation who says that Hillary held the women down while Bill raped them.
[00:49:17.425 --> 00:49:19.427]  It's just as credible as the New York Times.
[00:49:19.427 --> 00:49:21.769]  It's anonymous, of course, but we stand by it.
[00:49:25.016 --> 00:49:39.182]  This is such transparent BS that it's almost laughable if the mainstream media didn't pick up this stuff and run with it like a pack of rabid dogs.
[00:49:39.182 --> 00:49:51.107]  And that's the thing, is that the rabidness is just accelerating with 61 days left to total cuckoo land, where the stuff they're doing to me that I'll be able to cover soon, I'm checking with lawyers,
[00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:57.989]  Is so insane and so obvious and so over the top.
[00:49:57.989 --> 00:50:00.591]  I am a Russians here bag of money.
[00:50:00.591 --> 00:50:04.454]  I mean, it's getting cuckoo land.
[00:50:04.454 --> 00:50:14.623]  You know, the thing that's that's interesting though, Alex, and I was thinking about this last night is President Trump has had a number of really historic firsts, but he has never once.
[00:50:15.399 --> 00:50:18.624]  Gone to the American people with an Oval Office address.
[00:50:18.624 --> 00:50:21.768]  Something that's been very effectively used by all of his predecessors.
[00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:22.549]  Oh, I've been saying this.
[00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:24.692]  He needs to be doing them every week until the election.
[00:50:25.612 --> 00:50:27.532]  Well, he needs to do one now.
[00:50:27.532 --> 00:50:39.995]  He needs to take action, declassify all of the FISA warrant material would be an excellent start, and then go to the American people and explain why he's doing this.
[00:50:39.995 --> 00:50:45.937]  It would get the far left and the Democrats and the deep staters on defense as opposed to offense.
[00:50:46.597 --> 00:50:52.080]  They've got a track record of lies and criminality that he has the keys to exposing.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.922]  He needs to do it, and then take his case right to the American people.
[00:50:56.922 --> 00:50:59.144]  Like Reagan, he's a great communicator.
[00:50:59.144 --> 00:51:07.648]  He speaks the people's language, but he should avail himself of the bully pulpit, and he should do a televised address to the nation.
[00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:11.230]  The time has come.
[00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:13.031]  I totally agree with you, Roger.
[00:51:15.854 --> 00:51:21.513]  Again, words cannot describe how critical this moment and juncture in history is.
[00:51:23.399 --> 00:51:28.521]  You've accurately predicted with precision how they'd roll out what, when they'd roll it out.
[00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:42.408]  With 61 days left, what are you expecting to do with all of the talking heads saying, remove him, both parties remove him, and Nikki Haley behind the scenes working against him, and Pence going and parading around at McCain's funeral.
[00:51:42.408 --> 00:51:46.129]  I'm not trying to attack Pence, I hope he's a good guy, but it looks like he's hedging his bets.
[00:51:46.129 --> 00:51:49.651]  I mean, it's so obvious that all of this is a load of garbage.
[00:51:51.857 --> 00:52:02.100]  Well, you know, the most disturbing part about this was our recognition that the takedown of InfoWars was the precursor to all of this.
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:09.722]  The last thing they want is us out there every day, every night, pounding away at their phony narrative.
[00:52:09.722 --> 00:52:19.205]  So that's why you could tell when they moved on us, when one fateful day they suddenly removed InfoWars from virtually every viable social media platform,
[00:52:19.893 --> 00:52:24.778]  That this was related to something big, that the big event was coming.
[00:52:24.778 --> 00:52:31.865]  Now we see precisely what it is, the attempted takedown of the President in a 25th Amendment coup.
[00:52:31.865 --> 00:52:32.746]  When you have
[00:52:34.225 --> 00:52:43.510]  Voices as diverse as Steve Schmidt and Andrew Cuomo, or pardon me, Chris Cuomo, all on the same message.
[00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:51.234]  Republicans and Democrats must get together and realize the Trump presidency is a national crisis and remove him.
[00:52:51.875 --> 00:53:00.839]  No, the national crisis was what was left to us by the Bush-Clinton-Obama combine that ran this country into the ground.
[00:53:00.839 --> 00:53:02.280]  That's the crisis.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.961]  Trump is cleaning up their mess.
[00:53:04.961 --> 00:53:12.644]  And now the takedown of Infowars was integral because they don't want us out there with the clarion call.
[00:53:12.644 --> 00:53:16.166]  They realize that you're a modern-day Paul Revere, Alex.
[00:53:16.166 --> 00:53:21.048]  They've got to shut you up because you're going to tip everybody off as to what is coming.
[00:53:21.508 --> 00:53:27.355]  That's why they have been so spectacularly unsuccessful in their attempts to silence us.
[00:53:27.355 --> 00:53:30.518]  You try to shut Alex Jones up, he's just gonna yell louder.
[00:53:30.518 --> 00:53:31.159]  Don't you get it?
[00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:43.680]  Well, here's the thing, and I'm not bragging, because I don't want to intentionally make these very wicked criminal individuals that lie about WMDs and kill millions and fund Arab Springs and are trying to break our families up.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.463]  I mean, the ruling establishment is very, very cold-blooded.
[00:53:47.463 --> 00:53:53.668]  But when I went in there and in front row stared in Mark Warner's face, who we know is behind the censorship with Obama,
[00:53:54.713 --> 00:53:58.854]  In the executive orders, you name it, he looked genuinely scared of me.
[00:53:58.854 --> 00:54:08.877]  And when I was around everybody else, they just, it was like in the Senate and the House, they'd have doors open just pointing like Godzilla had just come out of the ocean.
[00:54:08.877 --> 00:54:15.259]  And it shows really how pathetic they are, because everyone else just worships these senators and worships these people.
[00:54:15.259 --> 00:54:18.220]  Little Marco Rubio comes out with his big giant Ferengi ears.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.260]  And says, oh, who are you?
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.001]  I didn't even get in his press conference.
[00:54:22.001 --> 00:54:23.121]  We were waiting in the hall to interview him.
[00:54:23.121 --> 00:54:24.461]  That's what you do.
[00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:26.322]  And then he says, I don't know who you are.
[00:54:26.322 --> 00:54:28.022]  I swear to God, I don't.
[00:54:28.022 --> 00:54:29.662]  Saying I don't matter.
[00:54:29.662 --> 00:54:31.423]  Everyone sees through this.
[00:54:31.423 --> 00:54:32.683]  It shows how insane they are.
[00:54:32.683 --> 00:54:41.405]  And then coming up next hour, I have a CNBC clip where I'm ranting about authoritarianism and how they're shutting down the independent media and they cut the live feed.
[00:54:41.405 --> 00:54:45.085]  So this is all coming up in the next hour, Roger.
[00:54:45.085 --> 00:54:47.866]  But it is just a hysterical time for these people.
[00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:58.054]  You know, I think a serious question here would be, is Marco Rubio literally the only person on planet Earth who doesn't know who Alex Jones is?
[00:54:58.054 --> 00:55:04.061]  I mean, I know you were very upset about this, almost despondent that he doesn't know who you are, Alex.
[00:55:04.061 --> 00:55:06.043]  I mean, what cave does this guy live in?
[00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:16.535]  To not recognize what's going on to conservative and Republican voices on the internet, Marco Rubio is allegedly a conservative Republican.
[00:55:16.535 --> 00:55:25.239]  He seemed oblivious to the entire issue of internet censorship and obsessed only with how the Russians and the Chinese may be censoring people.
[00:55:26.561 --> 00:55:33.547]  I can't even figure out what planet this guy is on or how anybody can be this detached from reality.
[00:55:33.547 --> 00:55:36.911]  In that video, he has even less hair than I thought he had.
[00:55:44.898 --> 00:55:46.298]  You were talking about China and censorship.
[00:55:46.298 --> 00:55:46.839]  Thank you.
[00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:48.559]  Hey, let's get into some of the other stuff.
[00:55:48.559 --> 00:55:53.460]  He just starts laughing at me and wouldn't even answer my question about conservatives being deplatformed.
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:58.342]  Doesn't he get what a popular subject that is and that that would endear him to his audience?
[00:55:58.342 --> 00:56:05.143]  Well, and Jack Posobiec from, you know, One America News tells me he was sweating profusely.
[00:56:05.143 --> 00:56:07.644]  So clearly you put this guy on the spot.
[00:56:08.446 --> 00:56:10.228]  He's a lightweight, as you know.
[00:56:10.228 --> 00:56:14.171]  I would predict you right now he doesn't fill out this Senate term.
[00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:23.920]  If the Republicans are successful in electing a governor in Florida, I think Rubio will leave the Senate to cash in on his deep state connections.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:34.649]  But to say that he doesn't know who you are and to refuse to engage you in a respectful debate on the legitimate issue of internet censorship just shows you what a pussy he is.
[00:56:34.949 --> 00:56:36.210]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:43.456]  I was in the front page of a bunch of papers everywhere about Jack Dorsey saying he didn't ban me, but that he also didn't give the order not to ban me.
[00:56:43.456 --> 00:56:45.458]  The hearings were partially about me.
[00:56:45.458 --> 00:56:46.519]  He knows full well who I am.
[00:56:46.519 --> 00:56:49.601]  They were talking about me in the hearing an hour before.
[00:56:49.601 --> 00:56:52.564]  So he's sitting there saying, I'm not going to respond to you.
[00:56:52.564 --> 00:56:54.565]  It's another form of censorship.
[00:56:54.565 --> 00:56:56.967]  I mean, I'm saying, hey, let's fight censorship.
[00:56:56.967 --> 00:56:58.829]  I don't know who you are.
[00:56:58.829 --> 00:57:00.070]  So it's very Orwellian.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.641]  Yeah, he's the little lord fronthroy of American politics.
[00:57:04.641 --> 00:57:08.341]  I mean, he is so very precious and so very fragile.
[00:57:08.341 --> 00:57:14.523]  He's also, as you have to admit, much shorter than you thought he would be, which is why the president called him Little Marco.
[00:57:14.523 --> 00:57:16.243]  Well, it's not bad that he's short.
[00:57:16.243 --> 00:57:17.763]  I mean, it's just that he's so arrogant.
[00:57:17.763 --> 00:57:23.884]  We'll be right back with... I'm only like 5'11 and a hunch over, so I'm about 5'6".
[00:57:23.884 --> 00:57:26.145]  I'm actually 4 feet tall.
[00:57:26.145 --> 00:57:26.805]  The truth is...
[00:57:28.428 --> 00:57:34.332]  I like Marco Rubio, and I wanted to be friendly and actually try to get him to talk about censorship, but that didn't happen.
[00:57:34.332 --> 00:57:35.993]  Said he acts like a tough guy.
[00:57:35.993 --> 00:57:38.094]  Remember, we've got big sales that are about to end.
[00:57:38.094 --> 00:57:40.235]  50% off of any of our best-selling items.
[00:57:40.235 --> 00:57:41.636]  We're about to sell out of some of them.

[00:59:47.903 --> 01:00:09.594]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.594 --> 01:00:15.778]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:23.359]  Alright, Roger Stone's looking for two more segments, then I'm going to get into the geopolitical news.
[01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:30.402]  Nike popularity drops 34% as Gen Z rejects Kaepernick ad campaign.
[01:00:30.402 --> 01:00:39.387]  Just like the NFL's down 40-something percent, but they don't stop because it's in their own New York, San Francisco, insane asylum bubbles.
[01:00:40.472 --> 01:00:47.077]  We want to see some guy that made 80 million dollars as a spoiled brat running around, pee-peeing on the American flag.
[01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:55.984]  Going back to Roger Stone, we got a really funny Marco Rubio intro next segment, but I almost can't have fun here, because yeah, we had a big victory lap, as you called me last night and said, wow, great job.
[01:00:55.984 --> 01:00:58.426]  I wanted to go confront my accusers, and they couldn't believe it.
[01:00:58.426 --> 01:01:07.353]  They looked horrified, and now they're even more horrified that they don't get, as they kick us off cyberspace, we just go take over the third dimension, like the Infowars army we've launched.
[01:01:07.893 --> 01:01:11.955]  It's totally peaceful, saying get information out, wake people up.
[01:01:11.955 --> 01:01:15.036]  They're really starting to get scared, I think, Roger.
[01:01:15.036 --> 01:01:19.779]  Well, and that's why Owen Schreier and I are going to set up a GoFundMe for our new bullhorn fund.
[01:01:19.779 --> 01:01:26.882]  In other words, we want members of the InfoWars Army to be armed with multiple bullhorns to make sure their voices are heard.
[01:01:28.539 --> 01:01:33.261]  It is an excellent example of grassroots activism.
[01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:49.868]  You saw the way a bunch of bratty punks who were paid by the Democrats busted up a judicial hearing based on their deep commitment to transparency, except for transparency when it comes to Hillary Clinton's missing 33,000 emails.
[01:01:52.005 --> 01:01:54.767]  They don't like transparency quite so much.
[01:01:54.767 --> 01:02:09.220]  Here's what I don't think they understand, Alex, and that is that people like us and David Knight and Owen and so many others there at InfoWars, we're not in this for the money or the glory or the or the, you know, the acclaim.
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.802]  We're in it for the fight.
[01:02:11.802 --> 01:02:13.824]  If we wanted to do this for money,
[01:02:14.913 --> 01:02:17.315]  We'd be on the mainstream media side of things.
[01:02:17.315 --> 01:02:19.317]  It'd be much easier to make a living.
[01:02:19.317 --> 01:02:20.778]  You would get more coverage.
[01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:26.342]  You would get the fawning coverage of the fake New York Times and the failing Washington Post.
[01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.664]  We're in this for the fight.
[01:02:28.664 --> 01:02:35.129]  And when people go to the Infowars.com store and they buy one of our great products or a t-shirt or they buy one of my books,
[01:02:35.706 --> 01:02:38.007]  That money's not going in our pockets.
[01:02:38.007 --> 01:02:43.268]  That money's going back into Infowars for additional people and legal fees.
[01:02:43.268 --> 01:02:44.168]  And let's explain.
[01:02:44.168 --> 01:02:46.789]  We have an instinct, a spirit, to not want to be slaves.
[01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:48.009]  Sure, money's fine.
[01:02:48.009 --> 01:02:48.409]  Sure.
[01:02:48.409 --> 01:02:52.750]  But we're not trying to get more powerful in the corrupt, stagnant system.
[01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:54.471]  We're trying to change that system.
[01:02:54.471 --> 01:02:55.711]  And here's the good news.
[01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:58.312]  Thanks to the listeners and everybody's support, we're doing it, Roger.
[01:02:59.983 --> 01:03:10.627]  Well, that's what was so aggravating last week when NBC said, Roger Stone keeps talking about being indicted by Mueller because he's seeking publicity and he wants to raise money to line his pockets.
[01:03:10.627 --> 01:03:12.848]  They were the ones saying it!
[01:03:12.848 --> 01:03:21.071]  I mean, if 12 people who worked for you went to the grand jury, if CNN reported that Mueller's going through all your banking records, what would you think?
[01:03:22.592 --> 01:03:27.713]  It's absurd, so when you get out ahead of it, these people say, act like you're trying to profiteer on the system.
[01:03:27.713 --> 01:03:29.453]  Well that's the thing, it's just double speak.
[01:03:29.453 --> 01:03:46.936]  CNN will say, ban Alex Jones and all other conservatives, and go ahead and put them in prison, and they'll have three senators say it, and then they'll have Oliver Darcy, the very guy spearheading it, go on TV and say, no one's taking Alex Jones off, he's insane!
[01:03:46.936 --> 01:03:49.317]  I mean, it's like, what are they doing?
[01:03:49.317 --> 01:03:50.957]  They lie segment to segment!
[01:03:52.512 --> 01:03:53.654]  It's Kafka-esque.
[01:03:53.654 --> 01:03:56.860]  That Darcy guy did not do well yesterday.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:01.047]  I thought that you exposed him as the fraud that he really is.
[01:04:02.656 --> 01:04:06.358]  It was, it was a total Mr. Jones goes to Washington moment.
[01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:13.783]  And I got to congratulate you because you had the courage to go right there into the lion's den and confront the face of evil.
[01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:16.505]  I mean, did you see Dick Blumenthal from Connecticut?
[01:04:16.505 --> 01:04:21.268]  The dead eyes, the guy who lies about his non-existent Vietnam service.
[01:04:21.268 --> 01:04:23.750]  These people are zombies and worse.
[01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:38.800]  You're right, we've got some of the little Marco Rubio coming up, and then I've got a boil down of talking to the Twitter CEO, trying to get questions to him, and of course talking to the man that looks like a possum that just climbed out of the carcass of a dead cow.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.902]  When I said that to him, he said, oh, you already said that before.
[01:04:40.902 --> 01:04:43.124]  I'm like, oh, you were watching.
[01:04:43.124 --> 01:04:44.025]  That's what you look like.
[01:04:44.025 --> 01:04:48.028]  I mean, the possum coming out of the end of a dead cow, I've seen it before.
[01:04:48.028 --> 01:04:51.050]  They have a look on their face like they've done something wrong.
[01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:51.710]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:53.332]  You've got some evil eyes, boy.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:05.938]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:05:05.938 --> 01:05:06.419]  It's you!
[01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:09.693]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:05:09.693 --> 01:05:18.438]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:05:18.438 --> 01:05:23.001]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:05:23.001 --> 01:05:24.442]  You are the info war.
[01:05:24.442 --> 01:05:27.984]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:05:28.664 --> 01:05:40.049]  That everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:05:40.049 --> 01:05:48.013]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:05:48.013 --> 01:05:55.076]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:57.817]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[01:05:58.337 --> 01:05:59.357]  Do I have a First Amendment?
[01:05:59.357 --> 01:06:03.418]  Because they're, you know about authoritarian regimes, they're lying about me and they're trying to de-platform me.
[01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:07.099]  26 companies working in concert violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.
[01:06:07.099 --> 01:06:12.641]  And now, Senator Warner and Senator Wyden have said, quote, there's thousands of sites worse than Alex Jones.
[01:06:12.641 --> 01:06:16.121]  So, we're becoming like Cuba, we're becoming like Vietnam, we're becoming like China.
[01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:25.824]  So regardless of what people think about me or the straw men, should I have a First Amendment or should these companies be able to violate the whole Safe Harbor Act and all that and then ban conservatives en masse?
[01:06:27.176 --> 01:06:28.778]  Yeah, I don't know anything about your site, man.
[01:06:28.778 --> 01:06:33.566]  To get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[01:06:33.566 --> 01:06:36.190]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.260]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:40.541]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:40.761]  Alex Jones.

[01:06:42.463 --> 01:06:42.763]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:42.763 --> 01:06:43.003]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.003 --> 01:06:43.283]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.283 --> 01:06:43.524]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.524 --> 01:06:43.744]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.744 --> 01:06:44.004]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.004 --> 01:06:44.224]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.224 --> 01:06:44.485]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.485 --> 01:06:44.765]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.765 --> 01:06:45.005]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:45.005 --> 01:06:45.245]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:45.245 --> 01:06:45.526]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:45.526 --> 01:06:45.806]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:45.806 --> 01:06:46.206]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:46.206 --> 01:06:46.467]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:46.467 --> 01:06:46.767]  Alex Jones.
[01:06:46.767 --> 01:06:47.127]  Alex Jones.

[01:07:02.222 --> 01:07:04.183]  There's a guy on the radio.
[01:07:04.183 --> 01:07:05.344]  His name is Alex Jones.
[01:07:05.344 --> 01:07:06.584]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:06.584 --> 01:07:10.266]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:07:10.266 --> 01:07:12.188]  Time to stop submitting to this parody!
[01:07:12.188 --> 01:07:14.349]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:16.190]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:17.951]  InfoWars went even further.
[01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:21.332]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:07:21.332 --> 01:07:25.335]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:07:25.335 --> 01:07:31.298]  Nobody can dispute the fact that InfoWars... InfoWars.com.
[01:07:31.818 --> 01:07:32.878]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:07:32.878 --> 01:07:33.538]  InfoWars.
[01:07:33.538 --> 01:07:34.439]  InfoWars.
[01:07:34.439 --> 01:07:36.719]  Right now the war is the InfoWars.

[01:08:04.411 --> 01:08:06.697]  You are receiving this transmission.
[01:08:06.697 --> 01:08:08.001]  You are the Resistance.
[01:08:13.922 --> 01:08:15.422]  Well, there you go.
[01:08:15.422 --> 01:08:25.185]  Marco Rubio, they have this arrogant thing they do where Oliver Darcy of CNN that nobody watches and listens to, but his main job is getting conservative, libertarian, pro-Trump media off the internet.
[01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:26.666]  He admits that to our face.
[01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:28.346]  He just said, no, that's not true.
[01:08:28.346 --> 01:08:29.327]  No one's taking you off.
[01:08:29.327 --> 01:08:30.987]  I've never called for you to be censored.
[01:08:30.987 --> 01:08:36.709]  But there's hundreds of tweets and dozens of articles and dozens of newscasts where he sits up there with Stelter pushing it.
[01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:39.590]  We're going to put some of those clips together.
[01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:40.550]  Why would Marco Rubio,
[01:08:42.329 --> 01:08:46.191]  He comes out of the door where the press waits for senators to come out.
[01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:47.291]  I didn't interrupt his conference.
[01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:48.432]  I started asking him questions.
[01:08:48.432 --> 01:08:49.052]  He ignored me.
[01:08:49.052 --> 01:08:50.053]  He started talking to them.
[01:08:50.053 --> 01:08:51.413]  So I started interjecting.
[01:08:51.413 --> 01:08:52.834]  He's talking about Chinese censorship.
[01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:53.354]  Good.
[01:08:53.354 --> 01:08:56.175]  What about happening here?
[01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:57.456]  So he goes, man, I don't know who you are.
[01:08:57.456 --> 01:08:58.276]  I don't know who you are.
[01:08:58.276 --> 01:09:02.478]  He goes, I swear to G.O.D.
[01:09:02.478 --> 01:09:03.979]  I don't know who you are.
[01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:06.220]  And everybody's like, this is ridiculous.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.781]  What is the point of that, Roger Stone?
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.021]  That's elitism.
[01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:14.806]  That's an elitist snub, which I think backfired very badly on him.
[01:09:14.806 --> 01:09:23.816]  I mean, I guarantee you in his home state of Florida, Alex, not only do people know who you are, but we have millions, literally millions of loyal listeners.
[01:09:23.816 --> 01:09:25.978]  I can't go out in public without being mobbed.
[01:09:26.784 --> 01:09:32.368]  Not only by libtards who want to fight, but by patriots who want to come up and shake my hand.
[01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:37.011]  And invariably, a majority of them say, oh, you know Alex Jones.
[01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:39.072]  Tell Alex Jones we love him.
[01:09:39.072 --> 01:09:41.174]  Tell Alex Jones to keep fighting.
[01:09:41.174 --> 01:09:42.775]  Tell Alex Jones we're with him.
[01:09:42.775 --> 01:09:44.816]  It happens every single day.
[01:09:44.816 --> 01:09:48.499]  That's what keeps me going, is for my children's future, is for everyone.
[01:09:49.762 --> 01:09:51.623]  One person that goes, F you, get out of here.
[01:09:51.623 --> 01:09:55.205]  As I was getting on the plane, somebody says, get out of DC, Alex, get out of here.
[01:09:55.205 --> 01:09:58.567]  Some lady did.
[01:09:58.567 --> 01:10:01.549]  But for that person, 30, 40 people said, stay strong.
[01:10:01.549 --> 01:10:02.250]  Keep it up.
[01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:03.850]  We know they're lying about you.
[01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:04.371]  And I say, you do?
[01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:05.391]  And they go, of course we do.
[01:10:05.391 --> 01:10:05.872]  We love you.
[01:10:05.872 --> 01:10:06.572]  Keep it up.
[01:10:06.572 --> 01:10:09.694]  I mean, I'm getting real love now from the persecution.
[01:10:09.694 --> 01:10:11.155]  Not just, hey, we like you, buddy.
[01:10:11.155 --> 01:10:14.157]  So I think they realize, though, they've turned us into martyrs, Roger.
[01:10:14.157 --> 01:10:16.198]  I think that's why they might try to actually physically get us.
[01:10:18.075 --> 01:10:21.798]  Sorry about that background noise from the Stone family dogs.
[01:10:21.798 --> 01:10:31.427]  It reminds me, yesterday, Alex, I was coming out of a restaurant, I'm at the beach with my family, and there was a woman wearing a t-shirt that said, my dog would be a better president.
[01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:34.389]  And I said to her, yeah, than Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:34.389 --> 01:10:37.132]  She was very offended.
[01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:38.493]  Oh my gosh.
[01:10:38.493 --> 01:10:42.156]  I tell you, why are they so angry, Trump said, when everything's going so well?
[01:10:42.156 --> 01:10:45.739]  Why do they fundamentally think their identity was tied up in that witch Hillary?
[01:10:47.388 --> 01:10:48.889]  It really is extraordinary.
[01:10:48.889 --> 01:10:55.011]  You wonder how people can be committed to the inexorable decline of the country.
[01:10:55.011 --> 01:11:01.913]  I love that clip where Barack Obama is doing like a town meeting and he says, folks, those jobs aren't coming back.
[01:11:01.913 --> 01:11:07.795]  And does that guy, I'm not going to mention his name, speaking of Donald Trump, does he think he has some magic wand?
[01:11:08.636 --> 01:11:10.697]  No, Mr. Former President.
[01:11:10.697 --> 01:11:14.560]  Cutting regulation and cutting taxes creates jobs.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.040]  Jack Kennedy knew it.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.501]  Ronald Reagan knew it.
[01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:18.962]  Donald Trump knows it.
[01:11:18.962 --> 01:11:21.544]  The only person who doesn't seem to know it is you, Barry.
[01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:24.445]  In fact, we've got that magic wand clip.
[01:11:24.445 --> 01:11:27.127]  We'll play in a moment because he's like saying those jobs aren't coming back.
[01:11:27.127 --> 01:11:34.891]  Well, yeah, because if China's got a couple hundred percent tariff on us, of course we're not going to be able to have any, you know, jobs here.
[01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.573]  I mean, it's one sided and Trump says that's stopping.
[01:11:39.249 --> 01:11:44.453]  Yeah, look, they are really, I've never seen this kind of hysteria.
[01:11:44.453 --> 01:11:53.439]  It's surprising that, you know, that they launched this assault in the doldrums of late summer, but you've seen their trajectory.
[01:11:53.439 --> 01:12:01.465]  Omarosa, McCain, Woodward, now the phony New York Times, you know, editorial.
[01:12:01.465 --> 01:12:05.688]  The New York Times is owned by Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.842]  When he's not owning the New York Times, he's the single largest donor to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:12:11.842 --> 01:12:18.504]  So why would we assume that anything, a single word, written at the New York Times is actually true?
[01:12:18.504 --> 01:12:23.726]  All the news that's fit to print, embellished with a left-wing tint.
[01:12:23.726 --> 01:12:25.187]  Well, it's more than that.
[01:12:25.187 --> 01:12:30.028]  I mean, Carlos Slim got $5 billion in federal money over eight years for Obama phones.
[01:12:30.028 --> 01:12:32.029]  I mean, he made literally
[01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:34.786]  Five billion dollars.
[01:12:34.786 --> 01:12:35.166]  Gross.
[01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:37.707]  They said the profit was three billion dollars.
[01:12:37.707 --> 01:12:40.608]  So of course he launders it back through the foundation of the New York Times.
[01:12:40.608 --> 01:12:46.590]  And as you know, the New York Times has had people on me for six months, Roger, and they can't even cook up anything.
[01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:52.392]  So now they just put out false reports that our traffic is down by half, which is not true.
[01:12:52.392 --> 01:12:55.033]  I mean, these people are complete liars.
[01:12:55.033 --> 01:12:57.134]  And I know everybody knows that, but folks, if you understand,
[01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:02.395]  They write giant articles now with just the most fantastical fiction.
[01:13:02.395 --> 01:13:05.618]  And I'm even reading it going, gosh, I can't believe they lie this much.
[01:13:05.618 --> 01:13:07.139]  This is so complex.
[01:13:07.139 --> 01:13:11.963]  But they write all this complex stuff to make it sound real.
[01:13:11.963 --> 01:13:19.550]  You know, I think a lot of people may not recognize that even inside these news organizations like the New York Times and the Washington Post and others,
[01:13:20.456 --> 01:13:22.438]  There are some honest people that work there.
[01:13:22.438 --> 01:13:26.542]  There are some real reporters who are unbiased and trying to do their job.
[01:13:26.542 --> 01:13:34.890]  And they're frustrated by editors who cut their stuff, who delete their stuff, who reject their stuff when they try to do an objective job.
[01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:39.614]  So even those news organizations are not monolithically dishonest.
[01:13:39.614 --> 01:13:44.239]  No, I agree, but the people that are total liars, they're put to the top of the food chain.
[01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:45.640]  Oh, there's no question.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.622]  Those are the editors, that's management, and that's where good reporting gets killed.
[01:13:49.622 --> 01:13:57.307]  But the woman who's working on a hatch job from the New York Times about you, she's hated by New York Times reporters.
[01:13:57.307 --> 01:14:09.754]  I have at least four conversations with current New York Times reporters who have no respect for this woman, who think she's a knife artist who lies, who think that she brings discredit to their entire publication.
[01:14:10.374 --> 01:14:12.535]  I responded to her questions about you.
[01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:17.657]  I'm waiting to see how she attempts to twist what I have said about you.
[01:14:17.657 --> 01:14:23.799]  By the way, I don't think she can find the proof that you're a Russian spy because it doesn't exist.
[01:14:23.799 --> 01:14:25.460]  Doesn't mean they're not trying, boy.
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:28.321]  This brings this bizarre narrative.
[01:14:28.321 --> 01:14:32.683]  How long has Alex Jones been on the payroll of RT, of Russia Today?
[01:14:32.683 --> 01:14:34.344]  Well, that's an easy question.
[01:14:34.344 --> 01:14:36.444]  How about never?
[01:14:36.444 --> 01:14:37.505]  How about never?
[01:14:38.486 --> 01:14:39.647]  They're such liars.
[01:14:39.647 --> 01:14:40.528]  It's extraordinary.
[01:14:40.528 --> 01:14:43.270]  And now they're actually trying to set me up.
[01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:44.811]  Let's play this clip that you mentioned.
[01:14:44.811 --> 01:14:47.474]  Here's that famous magic wand statement.
[01:14:47.474 --> 01:14:58.282]  And when somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[01:14:58.282 --> 01:14:59.663]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[01:14:59.663 --> 01:15:03.046]  What are you going to do?
[01:15:03.046 --> 01:15:04.667]  There's no answer to it.
[01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.330]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[01:15:08.681 --> 01:15:12.223]  What, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[01:15:12.223 --> 01:15:14.845]  What magic wand do you have?
[01:15:14.845 --> 01:15:18.267]  And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.
[01:15:18.267 --> 01:15:19.327]  That's enough.
[01:15:19.327 --> 01:15:21.509]  And that's the lie right there in closing, Roger.
[01:15:21.509 --> 01:15:25.571]  Trump laid out his whole plans and exactly how it would work and had top economists agree with him.
[01:15:25.571 --> 01:15:29.293]  But Paul Krugman of the New York Times said he'd eat his hat if it ever hit 3%.
[01:15:29.293 --> 01:15:29.593]  Yeah, no.
[01:15:32.631 --> 01:15:46.402]  The President, with the help of Larry Kudlow and Steve Moore, great economists at Heritage, had the most dynamic economic program of all the candidates, and now he's implemented it, and it's working!
[01:15:46.402 --> 01:15:47.242]  Come on, America!
[01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:48.543]  Come back from the dead, and you are!
[01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:49.244]  I love ya!
[01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:51.726]  RogerStoneColdTruth.com and BullWars.com.

[01:15:52.707 --> 01:15:54.468]  We'll be back with critical intel, straight ahead.
[01:15:57.737 --> 01:15:58.938]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.938 --> 01:16:04.321]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.321 --> 01:16:07.222]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.222 --> 01:16:10.804]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:16:27.409 --> 01:16:28.309]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:16:28.309 --> 01:16:30.711]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:38.835]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:16:38.835 --> 01:16:40.776]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[01:17:27.404 --> 01:17:28.625]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.625 --> 01:17:32.547]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:34.087]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:34.087 --> 01:17:37.049]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:37.049 --> 01:17:42.611]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.611 --> 01:17:43.812]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.812 --> 01:17:46.753]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.753 --> 01:17:48.974]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:48.974 --> 01:17:53.416]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:55.698]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:58.237 --> 01:18:04.601]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:18:04.601 --> 01:18:07.823]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:18:07.823 --> 01:18:11.526]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:16.229]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:19.491]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:31.380]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:39.927]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[01:18:41.548 --> 01:18:47.394]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[01:20:01.358 --> 01:20:19.675]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.675 --> 01:20:26.201]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:31.576 --> 01:20:40.128]  All right.
[01:20:40.128 --> 01:20:45.174]  If you just join me, I could sit here and revel in how much fun it was to storm
[01:20:47.294 --> 01:20:50.336]  The swamp in the Senate and the House.
[01:20:50.336 --> 01:21:00.764]  And then to watch corporate media act like it was so bad that I came and talked to cameras and that I waited in the hallway and talked to Rubio and how uncouth and evil and bad that is.
[01:21:00.764 --> 01:21:09.410]  You go to any of these hearings, they have Soros paid goons on record screaming and yelling at every hearing.
[01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:12.612]  And then they don't arrest those people, they just take them out.
[01:21:12.612 --> 01:21:15.054]  The police told me, if you go in there and do a disruption, you'll be arrested.
[01:21:15.054 --> 01:21:15.675]  And I said, I'm not
[01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:18.591]  Wanting to give you the images of me being arrested.
[01:21:18.591 --> 01:21:24.134]  I was saved from Antifa at the RNC by the state police that led me out when they attacked me.
[01:21:24.134 --> 01:21:28.297]  The news runs that everywhere like I'm being arrested.
[01:21:28.297 --> 01:21:29.597]  And they're like, you really aren't going to do it?
[01:21:29.597 --> 01:21:30.218]  We'll let you in.
[01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:36.581]  And I said, yeah, dude, I just told you.
[01:21:36.581 --> 01:21:40.644]  Why do I want to be in there when I can be out here with 50 news cameras, which I was.
[01:21:44.807 --> 01:21:48.428]  Yeah, there's the photo you see most times about me.
[01:21:48.428 --> 01:21:52.869]  The Antifa just attacked me and they grabbed me and drugged me out of the attacking crowd that was also attacking police.
[01:21:52.869 --> 01:21:55.170]  That turns into I'm being arrested.
[01:21:55.170 --> 01:21:56.170]  They run that everywhere.
[01:21:56.170 --> 01:21:57.571]  Jones kicked off the internet.
[01:21:57.571 --> 01:21:58.571]  He should be in jail.
[01:21:58.571 --> 01:22:00.732]  Boom.
[01:22:00.732 --> 01:22:02.272]  Everywhere.
[01:22:02.272 --> 01:22:04.493]  Absolutely everywhere, continually.
[01:22:04.493 --> 01:22:06.793]  And here's an example.
[01:22:06.793 --> 01:22:11.855]  Republicans were mad at Twitter for banning Alex Jones.
[01:22:11.855 --> 01:22:12.655]  Then they met him.
[01:22:14.892 --> 01:22:16.613]  That's a Slate article.
[01:22:16.613 --> 01:22:18.193]  And he goes, he's mean and crude.
[01:22:18.193 --> 01:22:20.254]  He disrupted Congress.
[01:22:20.254 --> 01:22:23.255]  He was mean to Rubio and broke into a press conference.
[01:22:23.255 --> 01:22:25.416]  No, I was waiting for him to come out the door.
[01:22:25.416 --> 01:22:26.617]  That's where they come out the door.
[01:22:26.617 --> 01:22:27.977]  That's what everybody does.
[01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:31.799]  I went over and confronted him about the censorship and he was very rude.
[01:22:31.799 --> 01:22:35.741]  But that turns into, I'm this wild rule breaker.
[01:22:35.741 --> 01:22:40.322]  They even have articles, should Jones be banned from government buildings?
[01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:43.004]  They are professional disruptors.
[01:22:43.004 --> 01:22:43.884]  I didn't break any rules.
[01:22:45.367 --> 01:22:46.207]  And I need to be banned.
[01:22:46.207 --> 01:22:49.348]  See, third dimensional banning.
[01:22:49.348 --> 01:23:09.595]  Look, man caught paying off Kavanaugh protesters, works for Soros funded organization, is a lawyer, and it's him handing out wads of cash to women that then go in and yell and scream, you're killing me, you're killing me, Kavanaugh's murdering me!
[01:23:09.595 --> 01:23:12.796]  Infowars.com, all of it right there.
[01:23:12.796 --> 01:23:13.877]  Their names, who they are,
[01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:17.887]  That's disrupting.
[01:23:17.887 --> 01:23:20.368]  Not me.
[01:23:20.368 --> 01:23:31.115]  And the point is, is that if somebody's really been wrong, like Laura Loomer, who they're banning everywhere, and then she goes and says, stop banning me in a committee hearing, that's up to her to put herself at risk.
[01:23:31.115 --> 01:23:33.496]  I support it.
[01:23:33.496 --> 01:23:39.840]  But these are all paid professionals, and then the media acts like I was disrupting?
[01:23:42.432 --> 01:23:43.833]  When they're the ones that do it professionally.
[01:23:43.833 --> 01:23:45.774]  Again, everything they do is a fraud.
[01:23:45.774 --> 01:24:00.843]  But then, Oliver Darcy, this low-energy weasel who gets like a hundred retweets when he tweets, who's the head of media operations and coverage for CNN, which means you've got to really be a deceptive weasel.
[01:24:00.843 --> 01:24:05.426]  You can read articles on Infowars.com with
[01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:13.344]  Hundreds of his tweets saying, ban me, and policing here, and policing there, and saying, he violated your terms here, where are you taking him off?
[01:24:13.344 --> 01:24:17.627]  He violated your terms there, and when he says it, he's CNN, it makes it so, because he's God.
[01:24:17.627 --> 01:24:23.251]  Even though they have no viewers, and are totally disrespected, and hated in the Kings of Fake News.
[01:24:23.251 --> 01:24:29.855]  So then I kept saying, you've called for me to be banned, and he goes, no I didn't, no I didn't, no I didn't, that's not true.
[01:24:29.855 --> 01:24:33.077]  It's this arrogance, this spirit of disrespecting you.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:47.688]  And so he's celebrated me being taken off all these platforms, and he goes around trying to get me off Twitter, but then to my camera, he's not going to admit he's censoring.
[01:24:47.688 --> 01:24:51.250]  He goes, no, I'm not, thinking you have no memory.
[01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:52.231]  That's evil.
[01:24:52.231 --> 01:24:53.372]  Here's some of the HD footage.
[01:24:55.580 --> 01:25:04.087]  Look at this right here, the guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong, there's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[01:25:04.087 --> 01:25:06.169]  You are incredibly shameful.
[01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:08.250]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:12.474]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:16.377]  You're going to go down the history books at the Criminal News Network.
[01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:18.559]  This is one of the main people right here.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.901]  Who thinks you have no memory?
[01:25:21.901 --> 01:25:30.368]  Who sits there and lobbies, show him, and sits there and lobbies people to take other news off.
[01:25:31.638 --> 01:25:35.759]  They're claiming they're fake, but CNN is the fakest WMD.
[01:25:35.759 --> 01:25:39.140]  Gulf Arab state dictatorship funded.
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.421]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:40.421 --> 01:25:42.401]  Hey, come on over here, Drew.
[01:25:42.401 --> 01:25:45.062]  I wanna get this down on tape.
[01:25:45.062 --> 01:25:46.643]  This is unbelievable.
[01:25:46.643 --> 01:25:50.844]  I was literally saying I don't see the criminal news network here, but indeed we do.
[01:25:50.844 --> 01:25:52.785]  Right there at the front line of the trough.
[01:25:53.665 --> 01:25:58.408]  To try to get in there and try to shut down conservative libertarian speech.
[01:25:58.408 --> 01:26:01.809]  And of course, he comes from the loins of Glenn Beck.
[01:26:01.809 --> 01:26:03.550]  I mean, look at those eyes, folks.
[01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:07.252]  You want to see the eyes of a rat.
[01:26:07.252 --> 01:26:08.373]  No, I'm serious.
[01:26:08.373 --> 01:26:09.974]  Look at the camera.
[01:26:09.974 --> 01:26:11.274]  Look at those eyes.
[01:26:11.274 --> 01:26:16.617]  Look at that slobbering of the system and the criminals of CNN, all their war mongering and death, all their fake news.
[01:26:16.617 --> 01:26:19.779]  And then running around trying to police the Internet.
[01:26:20.679 --> 01:26:21.480]  I don't know.
[01:26:40.943 --> 01:26:43.385]  Alex, Alex, you know, I'd say, so I've known Oliver quite a long time.
[01:26:43.385 --> 01:26:44.726]  Good to see you again, Oliver.
[01:26:44.726 --> 01:26:45.666]  Good to see you, Chuck.
[01:26:45.666 --> 01:26:46.587]  Good to see you.
[01:26:46.587 --> 01:26:48.608]  You know, he's from Fresno, and he knows that.
[01:26:48.608 --> 01:26:50.990]  Because, you know, in Fresno, we actually believe in free speech.
[01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:54.252]  And here he is censoring people and doing, organizing it.
[01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:55.733]  He's policing people.
[01:26:55.733 --> 01:26:57.074]  He's the thought police.
[01:26:57.074 --> 01:26:58.155]  That is the thought police.
[01:26:58.155 --> 01:27:00.176]  Before him, he worked for the right-wing.
[01:27:00.176 --> 01:27:04.679]  And, of course, I and many other people in the conservative movement helped his career along.
[01:27:04.679 --> 01:27:08.522]  And now he's decided that after he works for CNN, he's going to go and try and shut down voices.
[01:27:08.522 --> 01:27:10.503]  Look, I mean, he's even more evil-looking in person.
[01:27:10.563 --> 01:27:13.566]  You don't even respond because we're just scum.
[01:27:13.566 --> 01:27:17.250]  You sit there sitting with no viewers, no followers, everyone can't stand you.
[01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:20.253]  And no matter, you can shut everyone down on Earth, no one will like you.
[01:27:20.253 --> 01:27:21.495]  You understand that?
[01:27:21.495 --> 01:27:23.577]  You'll never have billions of billions of fans and followers.
[01:27:23.577 --> 01:27:24.538]  You'll never have people that love you.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.601]  Do you have anything else you'd like to say, Alex?
[01:27:27.601 --> 01:27:33.203]  You are a dishonorable liar who would never even dare have me on your little tiny shows when you and Stelter called me a virus.
[01:27:33.203 --> 01:27:36.004]  You are a virus to America and freedom.
[01:27:36.004 --> 01:27:38.705]  You are authoritarianism.
[01:27:38.705 --> 01:27:40.725]  Just look in those eyes.
[01:27:40.725 --> 01:27:49.509]  The hunger to silence America, the hunger to extinguish the First Amendment, the hunger to deceive, but he can't do it because the fire of liberty is not going to be knocked out.
[01:27:50.609 --> 01:27:53.011]  I want you to know I'm starting to come up here a lot.
[01:27:53.011 --> 01:27:55.333]  We're going to be seeing a lot of each other.
[01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:55.633]  Good.
[01:27:55.633 --> 01:27:56.154]  Just so you know.
[01:27:56.154 --> 01:27:57.155]  Always good to see you.
[01:27:57.155 --> 01:27:57.255]  Yeah.
[01:27:57.255 --> 01:27:58.856]  Is there anything else you'd like to say?
[01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:00.898]  Oh no, you don't talk back to me, you're slaves.
[01:28:00.898 --> 01:28:01.779]  You just act.
[01:28:01.779 --> 01:28:03.700]  Calling everybody's sponsors to get them to dump you.
[01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:06.363]  Working with Media Matters and the Nazi collaborator George Soros.
[01:28:06.363 --> 01:28:06.843]  Alright.
[01:28:06.843 --> 01:28:09.765]  Smiling like a possum and climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow.
[01:28:09.765 --> 01:28:10.926]  You used that one several times.
[01:28:10.926 --> 01:28:11.887]  It's what you look like.
[01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:12.968]  You need to come up with something.
[01:28:12.968 --> 01:28:16.791]  You look like a possum that got caught doing some really nasty stuff.
[01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:17.232]  In my view.
[01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:19.728]  You're a public figure, too.
[01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:27.254]  If I go to Twitter and say, he's bullying me, I'm only trying to be platform everywhere and celebrating it, and then insulting my viewers a week later saying no one's doing it.
[01:28:27.254 --> 01:28:28.995]  How dumb do you think your viewers are?
[01:28:28.995 --> 01:28:33.379]  That they have no memory, like Dari from Finding Nemo?
[01:28:33.379 --> 01:28:34.800]  He can't respond.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.680]  All you do is deceive.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.982]  Your job is to be a disruptor.
[01:28:37.982 --> 01:28:39.363]  This is not a response.
[01:28:39.363 --> 01:28:43.647]  This is not a... Are you saying the left isn't trying to be platform conservatives?
[01:28:43.647 --> 01:28:46.369]  This is not a... I'm not doing an interview with you.
[01:28:46.369 --> 01:28:46.829]  Exactly.
[01:28:46.829 --> 01:28:47.430]  There you go.
[01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.890]  Just look at it.
[01:28:49.272 --> 01:28:50.573]  Look at that person.
[01:28:50.573 --> 01:28:51.833]  He can't defend it.
[01:28:51.833 --> 01:28:53.334]  Full video on Infowars.com.

[01:31:57.791 --> 01:32:08.239]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.359 --> 01:32:10.421]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[01:32:10.421 --> 01:32:13.303]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:32:13.303 --> 01:32:14.784]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:14.784 --> 01:32:21.610]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:22.871]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:32:23.712 --> 01:32:33.400]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:09.248]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.248 --> 01:33:12.030]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:14.572]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:35.819 --> 01:33:40.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to play a few of these clips from yesterday that I'm going to get into the breaking news.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:45.902]  But here I am on some of the feeds in front of more than 50 news cameras.
[01:33:45.902 --> 01:33:55.465]  And I am laying out the reason I came to D.C., the reason I came to Washington, because they're not letting me face my accusers.
[01:33:55.465 --> 01:34:00.306]  And then they had another area where I was getting into the censorship, and they cut the feed.
[01:34:00.306 --> 01:34:02.687]  That clip's coming up next, but first this clip.
[01:34:04.073 --> 01:34:04.233]  It's
[01:34:21.158 --> 01:34:35.551]  This is the 11th hearing that they've had in the last year and a half where I'm one of the main focuses and I have not ever been called to testify when they say outrageous, slanderous, defamatory things when they've had in the House Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee, and others.
[01:34:35.551 --> 01:34:42.017]  They'll have people point-blank from the CIA, you name it, who are leftists, say Alex Jones works for the Russians.
[01:34:42.017 --> 01:34:46.041]  That is an outrageous lie beyond Joseph McCarthy, anything he ever did.
[01:34:46.041 --> 01:34:46.962]  But when McCarthy did it,
[01:34:47.722 --> 01:34:51.725]  The people got to come in and got to confront the committee and say, you have no decency.
[01:34:51.725 --> 01:34:52.986]  How dare you act like this?
[01:34:52.986 --> 01:34:56.428]  This is a hundred times worse than anything Joseph McCarthy ever did.
[01:34:56.428 --> 01:34:57.989]  And it's a shame.
[01:34:57.989 --> 01:35:02.892]  Mr. Jones, today's, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[01:35:02.892 --> 01:35:04.573]  This afternoon's hearing is- Sure, sure.
[01:35:04.573 --> 01:35:05.193]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:05.193 --> 01:35:08.455]  But every time we have these meetings, they bring up info wars.
[01:35:08.455 --> 01:35:11.477]  They claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[01:35:11.477 --> 01:35:12.578]  Obama established-
[01:35:13.198 --> 01:35:14.579]  With an executive order.
[01:35:14.579 --> 01:35:20.401]  He established with an executive order before he left office a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[01:35:20.401 --> 01:35:25.424]  What it's really been used is to target domestic populist popular groups.
[01:35:25.424 --> 01:35:34.968]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[01:35:34.968 --> 01:35:42.332]  There is a giant crackdown that even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet.
[01:35:42.892 --> 01:35:43.072]  To date.
[01:36:03.166 --> 01:36:04.687]  And then that feed got cut out.
[01:36:04.687 --> 01:36:07.308]  And here's another example of where they cut the live feed.
[01:36:07.308 --> 01:36:14.693]  CNBC cuts Alex Jones' live feed as capital as he rants about being silenced by dangerous authoritarianism.
[01:36:14.693 --> 01:36:17.174]  That's a Raw Story article.
[01:36:17.174 --> 01:36:26.540]  And what's shocking is Raw Story calls me a libertarian, which is accurate and is somewhat positive.
[01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:28.601]  Good, I hope the left wakes up.
[01:36:28.601 --> 01:36:30.522]  The fact they're coming after everybody's free speech.
[01:36:32.073 --> 01:36:41.418]  So the good news is I'm seeing more and more support from Republicans, Libertarians, people like Drudge Report, Tucker Carlson, they've always been supporting.
[01:36:41.418 --> 01:36:46.882]  But now I'm seeing some of the leftist publications getting what's going on that I'm saying at these hearings.
[01:36:46.882 --> 01:36:51.384]  Because the Republicans, a lot of them, are just as bad as the Democrats when it comes to this censorship garbage.
[01:36:51.384 --> 01:36:54.346]  So let's go ahead where they cut the feed.
[01:36:54.346 --> 01:36:57.047]  You just heard the opening bells here at the NYC.
[01:36:57.047 --> 01:36:58.808]  Let's send it back down to Carl.
[01:36:58.808 --> 01:37:00.850]  To Julia, actually, in the halls there.
[01:37:03.418 --> 01:37:08.461]  The media ran a hoax and said that I said things on Twitter I didn't say.
[01:37:08.461 --> 01:37:17.826]  And so again, they can say all day I violated their terms, Jack Dorsey didn't take me off Twitter, and you, the so-called media, has been foaming at the mouth to get me further deplatformed so I can't respond to the lies.
[01:37:17.826 --> 01:37:19.547]  Think about this in America.
[01:37:19.547 --> 01:37:21.769]  Think about this in America, that I have been unable
[01:37:22.987 --> 01:37:37.389]  This is the 11th hearing that they've had in the last year and a half where I'm one of the main focuses and I have not ever been called to testify when they say outrageous, slanderous, defamatory things when they've had in the House Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee, and others.
[01:37:37.389 --> 01:37:38.651]  They'll have people point blank.
[01:37:39.491 --> 01:37:43.854]  From the CIA, you name it, who are leftists, say Alex Jones works for the Russians.
[01:37:43.854 --> 01:37:47.856]  That is an outrageous lie beyond Joseph McCarthy and anything he ever did.
[01:37:47.856 --> 01:37:54.840]  But when McCarthy did it, the people got to come in and got to confront the committee and say, you have no decency, how dare you act like this.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:59.322]  This is a hundred times worse than anything Joseph McCarthy ever did, and it's a shame.
[01:37:59.822 --> 01:38:04.724]  Mr. Jones, today's, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[01:38:04.724 --> 01:38:13.307]  This afternoon's hearing is... Sure, sure, yeah, yeah, but every time we have these meetings, they bring up info wars, they claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[01:38:13.307 --> 01:38:14.407]  Obama established...
[01:38:15.047 --> 01:38:16.407]  With an executive order.
[01:38:16.407 --> 01:38:22.249]  He established with an executive order before he left office a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[01:38:22.249 --> 01:38:27.230]  What it's really been used is to target domestic populist popular groups.
[01:38:27.230 --> 01:38:36.813]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[01:38:36.813 --> 01:38:44.615]  There is a giant crackdown that even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet.
[01:38:44.755 --> 01:38:44.995]  I think?
[01:39:03.152 --> 01:39:10.701]  Alex Jones there, talking to our Julia Boorstin about efforts to get him de-platformed from various social media outlets.
[01:39:10.701 --> 01:39:17.509]  Gives you a sense of just how complicated the question's going to be here regarding First Amendment rights, the ability to speak... Alright, so let's stop right there.
[01:39:17.509 --> 01:39:21.914]  That was... I mean, the headlines cut it short, but in a way, they were being seeded, so...
[01:39:24.969 --> 01:39:25.869]  It's up to interpretation.
[01:39:25.869 --> 01:39:29.551]  I think CNBC is one of the better channels out there, by the way, when it gets to news.
[01:39:29.551 --> 01:39:33.533]  I mean, they've got their own leftist slant, but something like CNN or MSNBC, my gosh.
[01:39:33.533 --> 01:39:41.357]  But notice that their reporter goes, of course there's de-platforming of Alex Jones.
[01:39:41.357 --> 01:39:51.602]  Well, the CNN reporter that quarterbacked, that commanded, that field-martialed, me being taken off and was lauded for it by the left,
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.581]  To my face said, nobody's taking you off.
[01:39:56.581 --> 01:39:59.782]  And I've never called for you to be removed.
[01:39:59.782 --> 01:40:07.844]  That's all that comes out of your rat like mouth.
[01:40:07.844 --> 01:40:09.084]  Unbelievable.
[01:40:09.084 --> 01:40:12.745]  All right, I've got to get into the world news when we come back.
[01:40:12.745 --> 01:40:13.405]  But here's the deal.
[01:40:13.405 --> 01:40:16.306]  They're going after the president with 60 days left, 61 days left.
[01:40:16.306 --> 01:40:20.647]  They're coming after me and it takes a lot to shock me.
[01:40:21.724 --> 01:40:25.446]  Some stuff happened yesterday that I'm not at liberty to talk about yet before I left D.C.
[01:40:25.446 --> 01:40:37.111]  that was so bizarre and so ham-fisted that it just boggles the mind.
[01:40:37.111 --> 01:40:41.673]  I mean, Mueller is trying to frame me right now.
[01:40:41.673 --> 01:40:44.794]  Because everybody knows I'm not connected to the Russians.
[01:40:44.794 --> 01:40:46.075]  Everybody knows I love America.
[01:40:46.075 --> 01:40:47.796]  Everybody knows that about Trump.
[01:40:47.796 --> 01:40:48.636]  This is ridiculous.
[01:40:50.996 --> 01:40:52.978]  But they're planning to remove Trump before the election.
[01:40:52.978 --> 01:40:55.419]  And they even admit that in all these New York Times articles and stuff.
[01:40:55.419 --> 01:40:56.720]  They're making their move, man.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.481]  They're the danger.
[01:40:57.481 --> 01:40:59.182]  And it's our fault if we don't stop them.
[01:40:59.182 --> 01:41:04.346]  I'm not sure how we do it, but the president needs to start having emergency Oval Office addresses.
[01:41:04.346 --> 01:41:06.848]  Maybe he should announce one Friday and have it Monday night.
[01:41:06.848 --> 01:41:10.011]  I don't know why he hasn't had an Oval Office address yet.
[01:41:10.011 --> 01:41:10.471]  You know, boom.
[01:41:10.471 --> 01:41:11.472]  Talk to the American people.
[01:41:12.861 --> 01:41:14.382]  He does it out on the road, all the rest of it.
[01:41:14.382 --> 01:41:19.743]  He needs that presidential deal and just lay the cards on the table and say, if you like recovery, you like freedom, whatever, I'm here.
[01:41:19.743 --> 01:41:22.584]  If you want to be run on the ground by these crooks, then go with them.
[01:41:22.584 --> 01:41:25.505]  Now, here's the deal.
[01:41:25.505 --> 01:41:27.326]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment.
[01:41:27.326 --> 01:41:29.146]  I plug maybe once or twice an hour.
[01:41:29.146 --> 01:41:30.147]  I need to be funded.
[01:41:30.147 --> 01:41:32.268]  As you know, the enemy is suing me and coming after me.
[01:41:32.268 --> 01:41:34.488]  And we're winning, but it costs a lot of money.
[01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:35.649]  And they're trying to shut me down.
[01:41:35.649 --> 01:41:37.409]  And I want to expand their face.
[01:41:37.409 --> 01:41:39.250]  I want to hire more reporters, different cities.
[01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:40.330]  I want to watch more shows.
[01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:41.150]  I want to go 20, 24 hours a day live.
[01:41:43.885 --> 01:41:48.187]  And yes, these attacks have slowed us down.
[01:41:48.187 --> 01:41:51.389]  Our listenership is at all-time highs, but a lot of those are new people.
[01:41:51.389 --> 01:41:53.350]  They're not supporters yet.
[01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:54.531]  I need financial support.
[01:41:54.531 --> 01:41:55.912]  I've got products you already need.
[01:41:55.912 --> 01:42:06.018]  We have the ultimate tumeric formula for joint support, mobility, flexibility, inflammation support, immune support, tumeric root extract with 95% cubanoids.
[01:42:06.018 --> 01:42:07.198]  Nobody else has got that.

[01:42:12.947 --> 01:42:25.230]  Pepperine from Black Pepper and More Bodies is about to sell out in just the next few days, but I'm leaving it at 50% off because we're getting more in in October.
[01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:27.350]  Hard to believe we're almost that close.
[01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:29.211]  98% reviews on that baby.
[01:42:29.211 --> 01:42:31.531]  Infowarshore.com, the ultimate bone broth.
[01:42:31.531 --> 01:42:32.431]  It's 50% off.
[01:42:32.431 --> 01:42:34.492]  That special is going to have to end soon as well.

[01:43:57.128 --> 01:43:58.348]  We knew it was coming.
[01:43:58.348 --> 01:43:59.929]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:43:59.929 --> 01:44:13.194]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:44:13.194 --> 01:44:22.758]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten
[01:44:23.138 --> 01:44:24.218]  News Feeds.
[01:44:24.218 --> 01:44:27.219]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[01:44:43.242 --> 01:44:47.043]  But whatever you do, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:44:47.543 --> 01:44:50.250]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:55.361]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[01:44:55.361 --> 01:44:56.644]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:44:58.092 --> 01:45:02.213]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:45:02.213 --> 01:45:09.294]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:45:09.294 --> 01:45:14.095]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.

[01:45:58.268 --> 01:46:04.711]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products we have in InfoWars life, it'd take hours.
[01:46:04.711 --> 01:46:07.152]  Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price.
[01:46:07.152 --> 01:46:08.333]  It's stronger.
[01:46:08.333 --> 01:46:09.954]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[01:46:09.954 --> 01:46:13.175]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:46:13.175 --> 01:46:14.296]  It's back in stock.
[01:46:14.296 --> 01:46:17.457]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:46:17.457 --> 01:46:21.239]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:46:21.239 --> 01:46:24.341]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[01:46:24.341 --> 01:46:25.221]  So you can upload it.
[01:46:25.221 --> 01:46:26.682]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[01:46:27.142 --> 01:46:34.446]  But the Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:46:34.446 --> 01:46:35.306]  It's a spray you do.
[01:46:35.306 --> 01:46:36.627]  You can also swallow it.
[01:46:36.627 --> 01:46:41.970]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:43.351]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:46:43.351 --> 01:46:53.276]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWarsTore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:46:53.276 --> 01:46:56.338]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:47:01.733 --> 01:47:04.777]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:04.777 --> 01:47:05.778]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:05.778 --> 01:47:10.243]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:30.057]  Well, Millie Weaver, one of our intrepid roving reporters, has been on fire with her great cameraman, producer, and husband, Gavin Winch.
[01:47:30.057 --> 01:47:31.898]  She's going to be on next hour, riding shotgun with me.
[01:47:31.898 --> 01:47:37.063]  We're going to be taking your phone calls on what do you make of what's happening in this country.
[01:47:37.063 --> 01:47:39.065]  Infowars was number one on Twitter yesterday.
[01:47:39.065 --> 01:47:40.506]  Alex Jones was.
[01:47:40.506 --> 01:47:41.627]  Number one topic in the country.
[01:47:41.627 --> 01:47:43.949]  Number one on Google.
[01:47:43.949 --> 01:47:46.411]  And the videos we shot got millions and millions of views.
[01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:47.973]  So despite all the censorship,
[01:47:49.147 --> 01:47:52.969]  And the rumors of my death being greatly exaggerated, it didn't happen, did it?
[01:47:52.969 --> 01:47:59.452]  Now what is that an example of?
[01:47:59.452 --> 01:48:05.356]  Owen Schroyer had the idea of an InfoWars Army and Information War.
[01:48:05.356 --> 01:48:17.362]  For people to peacefully go out in public and legally and lawfully, unfurl banners at sporting events, unfurl banners over interstate highways, put up stickers and handbills in legal and lawful areas.
[01:48:19.275 --> 01:48:20.597]  The website's now up.
[01:48:20.597 --> 01:48:23.721]  Infowarsarmy.com.
[01:48:23.721 --> 01:48:24.322]  One word.
[01:48:24.322 --> 01:48:32.813]  You can go there, send us your email so we can send you alerts, email us back, show us video of what you do, and we'll put it on the broadcast.
[01:48:32.813 --> 01:48:35.236]  You want to fight 60 days out for the election?
[01:48:35.236 --> 01:48:36.297]  You want to know what you can do?
[01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:44.354]  I had a whole bunch of families learn that I was at the committee hearings, even though I announced it that morning, show up and were hugging me and saying, what can we do?
[01:48:44.354 --> 01:48:45.014]  You're so great.
[01:48:45.014 --> 01:48:46.575]  And I told them, you're great.
[01:48:46.575 --> 01:48:47.275]  You're awesome.
[01:48:47.275 --> 01:48:48.696]  You're amazing.
[01:48:48.696 --> 01:48:55.119]  You get involved because here's something that's really central to all of this and understanding.
[01:48:55.119 --> 01:48:57.301]  It's a Kit Daniels article that's at newswars.com.
[01:48:57.301 --> 01:49:05.345]  It's a Kit Daniels article that is at infowars.com.
[01:49:05.345 --> 01:49:07.186]  Nike popularity drops.
[01:49:12.047 --> 01:49:22.210]  34% as Generation Z rejects Kaepernick ad campaign.
[01:49:22.210 --> 01:49:30.813]  Now, why is this the key to everything?
[01:49:30.813 --> 01:49:31.393]  I'll tell you why.
[01:49:33.069 --> 01:49:38.192]  Because you've seen the NFL lose almost half its viewers the last three years.
[01:49:38.192 --> 01:49:43.775]  You've seen Hollywood lose about 38% of its viewers the last three, four years.
[01:49:43.775 --> 01:49:54.822]  You've seen every major corporate media outlet lose 25% of its audience year after year, except for a few shows on MSNBC and Fox and ABC.
[01:49:54.822 --> 01:49:58.204]  But in general, they've all declined massively.
[01:50:00.128 --> 01:50:06.952]  But Nike popularity drops 34% as Gen Z rejects Kaepernick ad campaign.
[01:50:06.952 --> 01:50:08.934]  Why is that so important?
[01:50:08.934 --> 01:50:12.736]  Their stock dropped $3.7 million.
[01:50:12.736 --> 01:50:16.559]  Then it dropped even more.
[01:50:16.559 --> 01:50:20.801]  And why?
[01:50:20.801 --> 01:50:25.324]  Because the idea that he sacrificed everything is not true.
[01:50:25.324 --> 01:50:27.866]  He was having a bad football season.
[01:50:27.866 --> 01:50:29.407]  He'd become scared of contact.
[01:50:30.953 --> 01:50:35.665]  He had become, what they call, a little bitch.
[01:50:39.710 --> 01:50:55.220]  He couldn't take it anymore so he got basically hired by Soros and others to be this PR person to go out and create racial strife and division in this country and start kneeling during the National Anthem, which is your First Amendment if you're not on the team.
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:51:01.624]  You know, can I work at Baskin Robbins and say that I'm going to wear a black shirt instead of a pink shirt or whatever it is?
[01:51:01.624 --> 01:51:02.105]  No.
[01:51:02.105 --> 01:51:07.188]  You work there, it's part of your contract, put your hand over your heart, stamp the National Anthem.
[01:51:07.188 --> 01:51:07.768]  That's the way it is.
[01:51:07.768 --> 01:51:08.409]  It's a corporation.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:17.146]  So you got the very same left saying, ban all conservative speech, shut us up, shut us down, take us off the internet, do this to us, do that to us.
[01:51:17.146 --> 01:51:27.135]  But then when Kaepernick wants to take a knee, and becomes incredibly unpopular, and the NFL loses all this money, they say, oh, don't violate his First Amendment.
[01:51:27.135 --> 01:51:29.196]  Fine, I say you go ahead and kneel.
[01:51:29.196 --> 01:51:34.581]  I will never watch another NFL game anyways, because I know it's a bunch of propaganda, it's globalist, it's just part of Hollywood.
[01:51:37.944 --> 01:51:43.086]  But it's really exploitive because Nike's known for having some of the worst factories in the world.
[01:51:43.086 --> 01:51:45.447]  They're nothing compared to Apple, but they're bad.
[01:51:45.447 --> 01:51:47.047]  And they're known for being exploitive.
[01:51:47.047 --> 01:51:53.770]  And they're known for targeting black youth with $300 and $400 worthless tennis shoes that are seen as status symbols.
[01:51:53.770 --> 01:51:55.710]  And so they're exploitive of people.
[01:51:55.710 --> 01:51:58.131]  They're exploitive of black people.
[01:51:58.131 --> 01:52:00.352]  And so of course they're then going to hold up Kaepernick.
[01:52:02.466 --> 01:52:05.750]  Who looks Native American to me, doesn't even look black, but whatever.
[01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:11.677]  They're gonna hold this guy and his racist, Islamist girlfriend up.
[01:52:11.677 --> 01:52:13.639]  As God.
[01:52:13.639 --> 01:52:19.145]  But the good news is, no one wants to hear it, and no one wants to see it, and in one week.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:24.441]  Popularity drops in all these different indexes.
[01:52:24.441 --> 01:52:25.141]  34%.
[01:52:25.141 --> 01:52:28.462]  Their stocks plunge.
[01:52:28.462 --> 01:52:30.222]  They're absolutely hated.
[01:52:30.222 --> 01:52:33.963]  And now they're associated with the dying NFL.
[01:52:33.963 --> 01:52:37.424]  The worst political move you could make.
[01:52:37.424 --> 01:52:41.385]  But therein lies the paradox.
[01:52:41.385 --> 01:52:43.545]  Why have you saw the NFL go down almost 40%?
[01:52:43.545 --> 01:52:44.566]  Some polls 45% or more.
[01:52:46.829 --> 01:52:57.575]  In three years, would you then associate yourself with what blew a hole in the bottom of the NFL boat and began the end of the franchise?
[01:52:57.575 --> 01:52:59.336]  Why?
[01:52:59.336 --> 01:53:01.737]  The NFL was almost twice the size of baseball.
[01:53:01.737 --> 01:53:03.498]  Now it's a little bit bigger than baseball.
[01:53:03.498 --> 01:53:05.059]  By next year, it'll be smaller than baseball.
[01:53:06.462 --> 01:53:09.464]  The NBA, you know, to say, we're not doing this, because they're smart.
[01:53:09.464 --> 01:53:10.644]  That's a growing franchise.
[01:53:10.644 --> 01:53:11.445]  They're like, no.
[01:53:11.445 --> 01:53:14.126]  People want to come drink beer and eat hot dogs and watch a basketball game.
[01:53:14.126 --> 01:53:16.147]  They do not want to hear a bunch of politics.
[01:53:16.147 --> 01:53:17.988]  So, this is a paradox.
[01:53:20.845 --> 01:53:24.368]  But the corporate globalists are bigger than the NFL.
[01:53:24.368 --> 01:53:25.830]  They're bigger than ratings.
[01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:27.932]  They don't care if it hurts the NFL.
[01:53:27.932 --> 01:53:29.233]  They don't care if it hurts Hollywood.
[01:53:29.233 --> 01:53:34.478]  It's about domination of America and world domination, and the Chai Com's taking over.
[01:53:34.478 --> 01:53:37.120]  And so, they're breaking eggs to make omelets.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:39.542]  They know this is destructive.
[01:53:39.542 --> 01:53:45.528]  But they want to get enough people racially charged with basically brown KKK type activity
[01:53:47.170 --> 01:53:50.793]  All run out of the special office that Van Jones is still in, the diversity office.
[01:53:50.793 --> 01:53:51.933]  They need to shut that office down.
[01:53:51.933 --> 01:53:53.354]  Trump needs to go after it.
[01:53:53.354 --> 01:53:54.355]  I've talked to people that work there.
[01:53:54.355 --> 01:53:58.878]  There's going to be some undercover videos coming out of there soon.
[01:53:58.878 --> 01:54:03.562]  And it is like a KKK rally, but it's black and Hispanic and Asian.
[01:54:03.562 --> 01:54:07.825]  And you don't get the job there unless you are F white this, F white that.
[01:54:07.825 --> 01:54:08.725]  Whites are scum.
[01:54:08.725 --> 01:54:09.766]  Whites are inbred.
[01:54:09.766 --> 01:54:12.668]  Whites are idiots.
[01:54:12.668 --> 01:54:13.449]  And I had
[01:54:15.188 --> 01:54:19.771]  Hispanic ladies come up to me, and white ladies, and white dudes, and go, F.U.
[01:54:19.771 --> 01:54:22.393]  Nazi in D.C.
[01:54:22.393 --> 01:54:23.154]  outside the hearings.
[01:54:23.154 --> 01:54:23.894]  It's on video.
[01:54:23.894 --> 01:54:25.276]  You ought to find those and play those.
[01:54:25.276 --> 01:54:27.537]  Those were epic videos from the live feed.
[01:54:27.537 --> 01:54:28.458]  See if Duke can grab those.
[01:54:28.458 --> 01:54:31.040]  It's right towards the end of the live feed before we left the Senate.
[01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:34.312]  And they're like, F you Nazi!
[01:54:34.312 --> 01:54:37.914]  And I'm like, well actually, I believe in Martin Luther King, I believe judgeable on what they stand for.
[01:54:37.914 --> 01:54:43.939]  Oh right, you know, your mother's married, you know, to her brother, you white scum.
[01:54:43.939 --> 01:54:48.542]  And just, I mean, it was like KKK stuff on steroids.
[01:54:48.542 --> 01:54:55.767]  And I'm sitting there, and they're just spewing all this racism at me.
[01:54:55.767 --> 01:55:00.491]  And I didn't dislike them because they were Hispanic, because I had great Hispanic fans coming, wonderful people, I was hugging all over them.
[01:55:02.773 --> 01:55:18.501]  I had like 10 groups of Hispanic folks come up and love on me, but there were these ladies that were kind of dressed like MS-13, all thugged out, and they were just saying, you know, get out of here pilgrim, you're trash, we hate you, you're subhuman, and it's all the same stuff the New York Times writer was saying.
[01:55:18.501 --> 01:55:19.622]  That's what they've done.
[01:55:19.622 --> 01:55:21.142]  That's what the globalists have created.
[01:55:21.142 --> 01:55:26.665]  So that's what this is targeting to create these people.
[01:55:26.665 --> 01:55:27.686]  The Brown KKK.
[01:55:29.773 --> 01:55:44.431]  So go out and push this narrative and put up giant billboards of this guy like an icon because he says America sucks and he says there's all this division because they're trying to counteract that Trump is trying to bring the country together.
[01:55:44.431 --> 01:55:46.473]  That's a sign of the establishment's desperation.
[01:55:46.473 --> 01:55:48.756]  So in that paradox lies the victory that
[01:55:50.191 --> 01:55:50.832]  We're winning.
[01:55:50.832 --> 01:55:51.852]  People are coming together.
[01:55:51.852 --> 01:55:54.074]  Double the number of black Americans are supporting Trump.
[01:55:54.074 --> 01:55:56.756]  Double the number of Hispanic Americans in just a year and a half.
[01:55:56.756 --> 01:55:57.817]  It's a landslide.
[01:55:57.817 --> 01:56:01.440]  That's why they go, well, maybe Southerners don't like Northerners.
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:07.585]  Let's reignite that and say that Trump hates Southerners, which is absolute balderdash.
[01:56:07.585 --> 01:56:14.550]  But again, they're just trying everything they can to try to divide us, but it's not working.
[01:56:16.604 --> 01:56:19.106]  So, here's the moral of the story.
[01:56:19.106 --> 01:56:21.008]  They're destroying themselves.
[01:56:21.008 --> 01:56:22.270]  They're the ones losing.
[01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:23.271]  They're the ones going down.
[01:56:23.271 --> 01:56:29.016]  They're the ones having to shut us down and ban us off platforms because we're too popular.
[01:56:29.016 --> 01:56:30.277]  No one wants to hear this.
[01:56:30.277 --> 01:56:32.820]  No one wants to see this, except really stupid people.
[01:56:34.764 --> 01:56:36.145]  It's pathetic.
[01:56:36.145 --> 01:56:40.287]  And almost all the white people I know aren't becoming more racist because of all this racist stuff.
[01:56:40.287 --> 01:56:41.688]  They're seeing through it.
[01:56:41.688 --> 01:56:46.811]  But so are, quote, most minorities, because they already figure out we're the majority now.
[01:56:46.811 --> 01:56:47.712]  We want free market.
[01:56:47.712 --> 01:56:49.653]  We want American pie.
[01:56:49.653 --> 01:56:51.574]  We want to just... We're getting it.
[01:56:51.574 --> 01:56:53.815]  We're in the club.
[01:56:53.815 --> 01:56:55.456]  They don't want you to take your birthright.
[01:56:55.456 --> 01:57:01.460]  The political elite are scared of you getting into America and getting into freedom, because if you do, it's over for them.
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:01.580]  Now,
[01:57:02.824 --> 01:57:04.305]  We're gonna come back.
[01:57:04.305 --> 01:57:05.305]  I'm gonna give the number out.
[01:57:05.305 --> 01:57:05.485]  It's 877-789-2539.
[01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:05.545]  877-789-2539.
[01:57:05.545 --> 01:57:07.926]  First-time callers, let's get Harmon in here to take the calls.
[01:57:07.926 --> 01:57:07.986]  877-789-2539.
[01:57:07.986 --> 01:57:09.967]  Specifically on the countdown to them trying to remove Trump.
[01:57:19.918 --> 01:57:22.679]  And specifically them saying, use 25th Amendment as we said they would.
[01:57:22.679 --> 01:57:24.619]  And all these fake stories they're publishing.
[01:57:24.619 --> 01:57:27.900]  What are they gonna do next with 60 days left?
[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.660]  What are they gonna... This is the question.
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:31.761]  What are they gonna pull next?
[01:57:31.761 --> 01:57:32.661]  To destabilize things.
[01:57:32.661 --> 01:57:33.941]  What's the next lie?
[01:57:33.941 --> 01:57:35.002]  How do we counter it?
[01:57:35.002 --> 01:57:36.342]  How bad do you think it's gonna get?
[01:57:36.342 --> 01:57:36.722]  877-789-2539.
[01:57:36.722 --> 01:57:42.183]  I know what they're planning to do to me.
[01:57:42.183 --> 01:57:44.264]  Arrest me as a Russian agent.
[01:57:44.264 --> 01:57:45.144]  Tried to do it yesterday.

[01:59:57.847 --> 02:00:04.391]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:00:04.391 --> 02:00:08.773]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:08.773 --> 02:00:10.754]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.754 --> 02:00:16.857]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:16.857 --> 02:00:21.760]  You know, on Tuesday, I told you I was going to drop some bombshells.
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:23.301]  Can we get the possum off the screen?
[02:00:23.301 --> 02:00:25.102]  He's starting to make me want to throw up.
[02:00:27.483 --> 02:00:37.405]  On Tuesday, I told you, you'll want to tune in on Wednesday, because we're going to have some big news.
[02:00:37.405 --> 02:00:40.746]  And folks know I don't hype, I just give you the facts.
[02:00:40.746 --> 02:00:43.407]  You're going to want to tune into the show tomorrow.
[02:00:43.407 --> 02:00:52.969]  Because I've decided, come hell or high water, I'm going to release the information on air that will not be national news.
[02:00:52.969 --> 02:00:54.449]  They will shut this down.
[02:00:54.449 --> 02:00:56.770]  Believe me, the order's going to go out, do not cover this.
[02:00:59.531 --> 02:01:04.457]  But they're making their move on this country.
[02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:06.699]  There's no doubt now.
[02:01:06.699 --> 02:01:18.452]  The stuff they've been pulling is so over the top, Trump has to remove that special office that the Clintons left behind with Obama at the Justice Department.
[02:01:21.252 --> 02:01:30.336]  And he's got to clean that CIA office out that Obama set up that intersects with the media because, man, these people are engaged in terrorism.
[02:01:30.336 --> 02:01:35.378]  I mean, it is down low nasty.
[02:01:35.378 --> 02:01:37.699]  I mean, I'm like, wow.
[02:01:37.699 --> 02:01:38.600]  Wow.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:38.960]  Whoa.
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:39.700]  That just happened.
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:41.301]  Whoa.
[02:01:41.301 --> 02:01:44.842]  They mean business.
[02:01:44.842 --> 02:01:46.123]  They mean business bad.
[02:01:51.428 --> 02:01:59.034]  You know, most people get threatened like this, and they just look for who they can bow down to.
[02:01:59.034 --> 02:02:01.536]  And I don't even think of myself as the toughest guy around.
[02:02:01.536 --> 02:02:02.877]  People do this stuff to me, man.
[02:02:02.877 --> 02:02:05.419]  It makes me get angry.
[02:02:05.419 --> 02:02:06.460]  And it makes me want to fight!
[02:02:08.285 --> 02:02:13.926]  Because I know this, I'm not going to run and hide in some ditch and have somebody have their way with me at their appointed time.
[02:02:13.926 --> 02:02:16.787]  They're coming after me, they're going to have it right now.
[02:02:16.787 --> 02:02:19.528]  Right out in front of God and country and everybody else.
[02:02:19.528 --> 02:02:22.108]  You want to bang heads with me, let's do it.
[02:02:22.108 --> 02:02:24.849]  And it's not because I'm looking for trouble.
[02:02:24.849 --> 02:02:27.670]  I'm a nice person.
[02:02:27.670 --> 02:02:30.910]  Man, you people are bad.
[02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:31.710]  You know what?
[02:02:31.710 --> 02:02:33.611]  Everybody can smell it's the end of your days.
[02:02:35.646 --> 02:02:44.914]  Let's come in with Cut You Down from Johnny Cash.
[02:02:44.914 --> 02:02:48.017]  And then we'll crossfade into Mother.
[02:02:48.017 --> 02:02:51.920]  So I think those two things bisect nicely.
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.021]  Then I'll take your phone calls.
[02:02:53.021 --> 02:02:54.662]  Millie Weaver's going to be joining us as well.
[02:02:54.662 --> 02:03:00.227]  But this country has just got a bunch of cowards in it.
[02:03:02.196 --> 02:03:13.866]  And it's got a bunch of yes men in it that just look for the biggest, globalist butt they can stick their nose in.
[02:03:13.866 --> 02:03:15.968]  That's what they do.
[02:03:15.968 --> 02:03:20.412]  They just run around looking for the biggest butt they can brown nose.
[02:03:23.692 --> 02:03:29.335]  And if something was big and great and free and the best thing in the world, well then, by all means, stick your nose in there.
[02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:44.904]  But sticking your nose in the globalists that want to destroy America and love the chi-coms and have sold the country out and don't want prosperity and don't like family, like we're groveling to the worst cancer this planet's ever seen?
[02:03:44.904 --> 02:03:48.446]  No, no, no.
[02:03:48.446 --> 02:03:50.988]  The globalist will to dominate and enslave us
[02:03:52.412 --> 02:03:56.196]  is their greatest strength, but it's also their greatest weakness.
[02:03:56.196 --> 02:04:05.445]  Just like they destroyed Hollywood, the NFL, Nike, the Democratic Party, the Republican establishment, even though they know it's unpopular.
[02:04:05.445 --> 02:04:10.990]  They want to force their will on us, and just like Kaepernick killed the NFL, he's now killing Nike.
[02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:14.834]  Everything they turn to in this new season we're entering is going to fail.
[02:04:16.650 --> 02:04:20.452]  Everything we do is going to bear fruit if we're willing to follow it through.
[02:04:20.452 --> 02:04:30.076]  But for those of us that were first to hit, those of us that were first to come in as the probes, we're going to have to pay the piper.
[02:04:30.076 --> 02:04:36.379]  And I, quite frankly, at a spiritual level, am super happy.
[02:04:36.379 --> 02:04:37.520]  And I almost feel guilty.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.962]  I'm like, what about your kids and everything else?
[02:04:40.962 --> 02:04:44.583]  But then my spirit says, their only chance is full commitment.
[02:04:44.583 --> 02:04:45.684]  The only chance we've got.
[02:04:56.319 --> 02:05:00.283]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:05:00.283 --> 02:05:03.566]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:05:03.566 --> 02:05:09.831]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:05:09.831 --> 02:05:12.613]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:05:13.334 --> 02:05:17.156]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:05:17.156 --> 02:05:23.639]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:05:23.639 --> 02:05:28.601]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.335 --> 02:05:33.258]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:05:33.258 --> 02:05:40.462]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.462 --> 02:05:45.165]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:05:45.165 --> 02:05:51.389]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:51.389 --> 02:05:55.352]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:06:09.147 --> 02:06:12.893]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:06:12.893 --> 02:06:15.818]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:15.818 --> 02:06:18.662]  Run on for a long time.
[02:06:18.662 --> 02:06:21.667]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[02:06:21.667 --> 02:06:24.131]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[02:06:26.247 --> 02:06:29.168]  Go tell that long-tongued liar.
[02:06:29.168 --> 02:06:32.009]  Go and tell that midnight rider.
[02:06:32.009 --> 02:06:35.530]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter.
[02:06:35.530 --> 02:06:38.411]  Tell them that God's gonna cut them down.
[02:06:38.411 --> 02:06:49.455]  Tell them that God's gonna cut them down.
[02:06:49.455 --> 02:06:54.497]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:56.363 --> 02:07:15.654]  What do you think the globalists are thinking when they say don't listen to Alex Jones?
[02:07:15.654 --> 02:07:19.256]  I mean, if they knew the Streisand effect, they'd be fools.
[02:07:19.256 --> 02:07:22.278]  They don't have a choice.
[02:07:22.278 --> 02:07:24.359]  And sometimes they succeed in places like China.
[02:07:30.019 --> 02:07:32.061]  They do want to bang heads, folks.
[02:07:32.061 --> 02:07:33.542]  They can't help it.
[02:07:33.542 --> 02:07:36.325]  Because they know you're better than them.
[02:07:36.325 --> 02:07:38.447]  And their whole will is to bring you down.
[02:07:38.447 --> 02:07:41.269]  So why are you sleeping?
[02:07:41.269 --> 02:07:43.431]  Why are you about to bow down to these people?
[02:07:43.431 --> 02:07:44.572]  Why?
[02:07:44.572 --> 02:07:46.474]  Why would you give in to fear?
[02:07:46.474 --> 02:07:51.778]  It's the animated contest that energizes the soul.
[02:07:51.778 --> 02:07:52.079]  All right.
[02:07:53.277 --> 02:07:54.939]  I'm going to start taking your calls throughout the hour.
[02:07:54.939 --> 02:07:55.819]  Millie Weaver's joining us.
[02:07:55.819 --> 02:08:03.567]  We've got some insane clips that really haven't gotten the attention like the tens of millions of views of our other adventures and travails.
[02:08:03.567 --> 02:08:09.132]  They're in the swamp yesterday with our invasion of the swamp, which the media spun.
[02:08:09.132 --> 02:08:11.554]  Look at this uncouth brigand.
[02:08:11.554 --> 02:08:17.320]  He came in and messed up the decorum and talked in front of a press conference and everyone pointed their cameras at him.
[02:08:21.957 --> 02:08:23.858]  And they go, no wonder he's been banned!
[02:08:23.858 --> 02:08:30.023]  Meanwhile, they've got their own paid people in the committees screaming and yelling and being drug out.
[02:08:30.023 --> 02:08:31.204]  No NRA!
[02:08:31.204 --> 02:08:32.565]  No KKK!
[02:08:32.565 --> 02:08:33.285]  No Trump!
[02:08:33.285 --> 02:08:34.106]  No NRA!
[02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:37.508]  No KKK!
[02:08:37.508 --> 02:08:47.836]  Meanwhile, I'm going to show you footage of these super racist Hispanic ladies saying horrible things about white people, which is not the average Hispanic person.
[02:08:47.836 --> 02:08:50.358]  It just shows who the left are.
[02:08:50.358 --> 02:08:50.878]  Crazy people!
[02:08:54.505 --> 02:08:59.949]  They have paid protesters that go in and get drug out and then they say, the hearings are partially about me.
[02:08:59.949 --> 02:09:04.393]  I was talked about in the hearings, of course, and all the other hearings, you've seen the clips.
[02:09:04.393 --> 02:09:12.620]  I'm bad for showing up at a hearing attacking me and talking to the press because I argue with people.
[02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:17.724]  But they're good when they're paid by George Soros to actually disrupt the committee, which I didn't do.
[02:09:20.609 --> 02:09:23.770]  The cops, about three minutes into the press conference, though, said, come in here.
[02:09:23.770 --> 02:09:25.010]  Who are you, Alex Jones?
[02:09:25.010 --> 02:09:25.470]  Oh, yeah, OK.
[02:09:25.470 --> 02:09:26.070]  Oh, all right.
[02:09:26.070 --> 02:09:26.730]  We just wanted to know.
[02:09:26.730 --> 02:09:30.311]  We've never seen the media cover somebody like this.
[02:09:30.311 --> 02:09:32.912]  I'm like, yeah, they're here because I told them I was coming.
[02:09:32.912 --> 02:09:35.712]  And then later, the cops found out, and they're like, wow.
[02:09:35.712 --> 02:09:45.034]  But I made the decision that if they didn't let me have that press conference, then I was going to go in the committee room.
[02:09:45.034 --> 02:09:49.475]  And I basically told the head cop then, I said, listen, man, they're talking about me in the hearing.
[02:09:50.759 --> 02:09:51.759]  I go, he goes, who are you?
[02:09:51.759 --> 02:09:52.240]  I go, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:54.141]  He goes, you're Alex Jones?
[02:09:54.141 --> 02:09:56.041]  And I said, yes, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:09:56.041 --> 02:09:58.142]  They're having these hearings about me and everybody else.
[02:09:58.142 --> 02:09:59.583]  They just deplatformed me.
[02:09:59.583 --> 02:10:00.423]  Have you heard about that?
[02:10:00.423 --> 02:10:04.045]  The guy gets, he goes, oh, you're the guy that took, oh, you, oh, Alex Jones.
[02:10:04.045 --> 02:10:04.946]  Like, yeah, dude.
[02:10:04.946 --> 02:10:06.266]  He goes, oh, well, go ahead.
[02:10:06.266 --> 02:10:07.207]  Sure.
[02:10:07.207 --> 02:10:08.467]  You're not gonna disrupt the committee though, right?
[02:10:08.467 --> 02:10:09.848]  I go, no, man, I don't wanna be arrested.
[02:10:10.984 --> 02:10:13.347]  Have you seen the photos of me with the state police holding me?
[02:10:13.347 --> 02:10:14.629]  He goes, yeah, did you get arrested?
[02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:16.531]  I said, no, Antifa attacked me.
[02:10:16.531 --> 02:10:19.154]  And then they took me out of the crowd and that's all the media shows.
[02:10:19.154 --> 02:10:22.899]  Believe me, I'm not going to disrupt the committee.
[02:10:22.899 --> 02:10:26.143]  As long as I get to go out there.
[02:10:26.143 --> 02:10:27.525]  To the press conference outside.
[02:10:27.525 --> 02:10:28.666]  He goes, well, by all means, go ahead.
[02:10:28.666 --> 02:10:29.928]  I just want to know what the hell is going on.
[02:10:33.496 --> 02:10:35.097]  And I was never planning to disrupt the thing.
[02:10:35.097 --> 02:10:43.380]  But when I told him I wasn't going to, at that point, even if they shut me down outside, I wasn't going to do it because I told him I wasn't.
[02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:58.886]  The difference is I wasn't buses of people arriving that we've got video and photos of on Infowars.com and being paid cash money by known lawyers that work for Soros, good detective work, to go in and disrupt things and to create the illusion
[02:11:02.208 --> 02:11:06.329]  That there's people against this Supreme Court nominee.
[02:11:06.329 --> 02:11:09.050]  Go see the video, go see the photos on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:09.050 --> 02:11:12.111]  It is incredible.
[02:11:12.111 --> 02:11:20.733]  Okay, I'm going to go to Jeremiah and Tim and Bob and a bunch of others here in just a moment.
[02:11:20.733 --> 02:11:26.355]  Please just briefly understand, just like our information's game-changing, the supplements we have
[02:11:27.688 --> 02:11:28.868]  Are incredible.
[02:11:28.868 --> 02:11:52.874]  Whether it's the Multivitamin Mineral Fruit Punch Mix for you and your children, Vitamin Refusion, or whether it's Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, or the new Bone Broth Concentrated Formula, or whether it is X2, by the way it's in short supply, or the Super Blue Fluoride Free Family of Toothpaste, or Knockout, there's big sales from 25 to 50% off right now and they're about to end.
[02:11:54.741 --> 02:11:56.461]  But you see the attack we're under.
[02:11:56.461 --> 02:11:59.502]  You see how they're trying to bankrupt us.
[02:11:59.502 --> 02:12:03.803]  And I let it stand or fall with what you do, whether they're able to shut down InfoWars.
[02:12:03.803 --> 02:12:07.223]  But right now, you've come through, but just enough.
[02:12:07.223 --> 02:12:12.844]  And I'd like to have some extra money in the gas tank to hire more crew and really fight back.
[02:12:12.844 --> 02:12:14.225]  Because I just want to fight back.
[02:12:14.225 --> 02:12:17.285]  I just want to win.
[02:12:17.285 --> 02:12:19.666]  I want to defeat these people and I can't do it without you.
[02:12:19.666 --> 02:12:20.606]  So InfoWarsStore.com
[02:12:22.003 --> 02:12:22.583]  Or Cripple 8253-3139.
[02:12:22.583 --> 02:12:28.146]  A lot of big specials are going to have to end the next few days.
[02:12:28.146 --> 02:12:31.388]  Bodies, Ultimate Bone Broth, discounts and others.
[02:12:31.388 --> 02:12:32.589]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:12:32.589 --> 02:12:33.810]  The fish oil is game changing.
[02:12:33.810 --> 02:12:34.610]  It's all amazing.
[02:12:34.610 --> 02:12:36.811]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a video.
[02:12:36.811 --> 02:12:37.392]  It's all there.
[02:12:38.217 --> 02:12:39.197]  We've got a lot of great gear.
[02:12:39.197 --> 02:12:42.699]  We have these new magnets that go on the side of your car so it won't key your car.
[02:12:42.699 --> 02:12:46.880]  Drive around with InfoWars.com on the side and then take it off when you get where you're going.
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:50.601]  The amazing George Washington in his Prime shirt with a musket and a tomahawk.
[02:12:50.601 --> 02:12:52.642]  That's a great bestseller.
[02:12:52.642 --> 02:12:55.023]  We've got I Am The Resistance shirts.
[02:12:55.023 --> 02:12:57.163]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:12:57.163 --> 02:13:00.484]  Okay, who should we go to first?
[02:13:00.484 --> 02:13:02.945]  Tim in Montreal, Canada.
[02:13:02.945 --> 02:13:04.286]  Or no, Tim in Montana.
[02:13:04.286 --> 02:13:05.546]  My eyes are reading wrong.
[02:13:05.546 --> 02:13:06.807]  Jeremiah in Virginia.
[02:13:06.807 --> 02:13:07.547]  Bob in Tennessee.
[02:13:10.507 --> 02:13:12.308]  Let's go to Bob in Tennessee first.
[02:13:12.308 --> 02:13:12.909]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:13:12.909 --> 02:13:14.990]  Thanks for calling.
[02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.711]  Yes, Eric.
[02:13:15.711 --> 02:13:17.972]  I'm so proud of you yesterday confronting Rubio.
[02:13:17.972 --> 02:13:21.795]  I have a quick point about the free speech and their attack on Trump.
[02:13:21.795 --> 02:13:36.565]  I was military, Air Force pilot, and the platform internet, the utility, was developed by the military and DOD and used for inter and other communications long before it was released in the mainstream.
[02:13:37.546 --> 02:13:46.052]  These folks have no right, obviously, to monopolize and then regulate a publicly paid-for utility called the Internet.
[02:13:46.052 --> 02:13:46.833]  They can't do that.
[02:13:46.833 --> 02:13:49.895]  They have no rights to that.
[02:13:49.895 --> 02:13:52.797]  And by the way, what you said is 100% fact.
[02:13:52.797 --> 02:13:54.358]  It's in the federal law.
[02:13:54.358 --> 02:14:05.667]  And the reporters, when I would tell them about the different laws and subsections, didn't even know that it was built by DARPA and Google and all these companies agreed, under federal law, to leave it as an open commons.
[02:14:07.247 --> 02:14:08.308]  Right.
[02:14:08.308 --> 02:14:08.668]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:08.668 --> 02:14:12.571]  But to Dorsey's credit, he said that during the hearing.
[02:14:12.571 --> 02:14:12.951]  Go ahead.
[02:14:12.951 --> 02:14:13.592]  Or Jack Dorsey.
[02:14:13.592 --> 02:14:15.233]  Go ahead.
[02:14:15.233 --> 02:14:17.155]  No, I hate to interrupt you.
[02:14:17.155 --> 02:14:19.877]  By the way, I loved your conversation with Rubio yesterday.
[02:14:19.877 --> 02:14:21.738]  The next point, this is on Russian collusion.
[02:14:21.738 --> 02:14:24.060]  I know this is a dead horse, but real quick.
[02:14:24.060 --> 02:14:26.162]  My thought on this is real simple.
[02:14:26.162 --> 02:14:30.565]  One is, there's no such statute as collusion, but if there was, tell me.
[02:14:31.246 --> 02:14:37.388]  Did JFK not collude with Khrushchev to prevent a nuclear exchange, World War III?
[02:14:37.388 --> 02:14:44.570]  And in doing so, wasn't that not his duty to collude with Khrushchev and do exactly that?
[02:14:44.570 --> 02:14:47.031]  Well, presidents are their own branch of government.
[02:14:47.031 --> 02:14:48.912]  They're allowed to talk to whoever they want.
[02:14:48.912 --> 02:14:50.852]  And if we disagree, we impeach them over it.
[02:14:50.852 --> 02:14:56.694]  But yes, it's his duty, once president-elect, to start talking to all the major powers.
[02:14:59.062 --> 02:15:02.843]  So the whole concept on its face is ridiculous.
[02:15:02.843 --> 02:15:04.804]  This is the largest nuclear power in the world.
[02:15:04.804 --> 02:15:09.885]  Of course we need to collude, or talk, or speak, or work with the Russians.
[02:15:09.885 --> 02:15:12.126]  Come on, it's ridiculous.
[02:15:12.126 --> 02:15:15.947]  Brother, the Democrats are in bed with the Chai-coms.
[02:15:15.947 --> 02:15:17.527]  They're scared it's going to come out.
[02:15:17.527 --> 02:15:20.988]  So they're projecting onto us what they are, traitors.
[02:15:20.988 --> 02:15:26.670]  And so that's why they're actively investigating me and trying to set me up
[02:15:27.797 --> 02:15:31.040]  Wait till I get into it with the Russians.
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:41.510]  I mean, it's now reached that point where they're asking dozens of people about Russians and me, they have New York Times people asking me, and then now they've gone to the next level.
[02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:44.373]  I mean, we're talking stings, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:44.373 --> 02:15:49.298]  We have now reached the level of people with suitcases of cash.
[02:15:49.298 --> 02:15:50.499]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[02:15:50.499 --> 02:15:51.440]  We'll be back, stay with us.

[02:20:10.416 --> 02:20:12.256]  We are on the march.
[02:20:12.256 --> 02:20:15.437]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:20:15.437 --> 02:20:19.578]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:20:19.578 --> 02:20:25.700]  You know, the mainstream corporate media is mindless.
[02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:27.521]  They take whatever they're told on the face
[02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:33.883]  Like, you could name a barn, Black Barn, but then the barn's red.
[02:20:33.883 --> 02:20:37.745]  Or you could name a fish, Green Fish, and the fish is blue.
[02:20:37.745 --> 02:20:41.708]  Or you could name a river, Dry River, and it's really always flowing.
[02:20:42.523 --> 02:20:45.644]  So they're like, oh, it's a foreign interference internet meeting.
[02:20:45.644 --> 02:20:47.745]  But I could see what it was going to be.
[02:20:47.745 --> 02:20:54.128]  They had all these other things called that last year, where it would be about me and banning us and Jones as a Russian agent and all this crap.
[02:20:54.128 --> 02:20:55.389]  And so I knew to go to it.
[02:20:55.389 --> 02:20:57.330]  Sure enough, it was about censoring the web.
[02:20:57.330 --> 02:20:59.751]  Millie Weaver's been all over the country.
[02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:01.712]  Trump rallies, you name it.
[02:21:01.712 --> 02:21:06.094]  We'll take calls with her coming up in the next segment with Tim and everybody else that's patiently holding me.
[02:21:06.094 --> 02:21:11.376]  You were making some great points during the break about following the hearings that we were at yourself and what you took away from that, Millie.
[02:21:12.639 --> 02:21:21.968]  Well, Alex, I really thought that, you know, the mainstream media did a lot of coverage on the Kavanaugh hearing yesterday, which is mainly what I was watching and following.
[02:21:21.968 --> 02:21:29.575]  So I just assumed that this social media hearing was going to be about addressing social media and how they've been censoring conservatives.
[02:21:29.875 --> 02:21:48.905]  But no, when I actually sat down and watched the hearing this morning, come to find out this is all about censoring people and whether or not Facebook and Twitter is going to comply with the Democrats and globalists demanding that they act as their authoritarian tools to censor their political opposition.
[02:21:49.525 --> 02:21:56.654]  All the Democrats did was sit there and say, we can censor you, we can ban you, we can take your companies over if you don't do what we say.
[02:21:56.654 --> 02:22:05.565]  And now I know the rock and the hard place, why suddenly Dorsey, who's been somewhat pro-censorship, is suddenly no, no, no, because he now gets there about to take him over.
[02:22:06.684 --> 02:22:07.285]  Exactly.
[02:22:07.285 --> 02:22:12.389]  And what we saw was kind of a black and white night and day between Twitter and Facebook.
[02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:22.977]  Now, both were being pressured by the Democrats in Congress to essentially do their bidding and start removing political opponents and conservatives off of Facebook or Twitter.
[02:22:22.977 --> 02:22:27.001]  But what was interesting was that Sheryl Sandberg, the representative from Facebook,
[02:22:27.541 --> 02:22:35.265]  Literally sounds like the most authoritarian big brother, I call her big mother now, that I've ever heard.
[02:22:35.265 --> 02:22:43.430]  It was just so creepy to hear her talking about the tactics and how serious they are about trying to remove quote-unquote fake news.
[02:22:43.430 --> 02:22:46.571]  Well, we all know fake news is just as arbitrary.
[02:22:48.697 --> 02:23:01.641]  Well that's right, they also said the same thing about, your Skype's breaking up for a moment, about quote, hate speech, it's whatever they want, and they were really coming after Jack Dorsey, threatening, well you're selling opiates on there, we could federalize you right away.
[02:23:01.641 --> 02:23:16.506]  So clearly, I only found that Senator Cotton got it right, in the Senate, when he brought up, hey, you don't even let our own military work with Google, you don't even, Google's moved to China, and notice Google wasn't there, very conspicuously that Google is completely globalist.
[02:23:17.898 --> 02:23:20.860]  Yeah, Google was a no-show, essentially.
[02:23:20.860 --> 02:23:36.188]  But what's interesting is that Jack Dorsey actually stated on the record that his parents are Republican and Democrat, so he grew up in a household that was a little bit more open to political idea, and he kind of sees Twitter as something being like that along those lines.
[02:23:36.528 --> 02:23:40.611]  He mentioned that it's a neutral public forum, which is key.
[02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:42.792]  He said it's the commons, which is the law.
[02:23:42.792 --> 02:23:51.037]  I gotta say, not just because he kept us on Twitter, but because I'm not defending some of his censorship, but what he was saying was true, that we're at public commons like a park.
[02:23:51.037 --> 02:23:52.598]  I mean, he was actually saying what the law is.
[02:23:53.493 --> 02:24:06.842]  Well, what it is, is he knows that he doesn't want to lose his Section 203 immunities under the Communications Act, which grants him the right to be able to have content posted by third parties and not be liable for it.
[02:24:06.842 --> 02:24:08.603]  To not be sued over slander or something.
[02:24:08.603 --> 02:24:09.563]  He gets the setup.
[02:24:09.563 --> 02:24:10.224]  He gets the setup.
[02:24:10.224 --> 02:24:13.366]  Because the Democrats admit they plan to get in and take the internet over.
[02:24:14.767 --> 02:24:41.003]  Exactly, and the thing with Facebook and Zuckerberg, Ted Cruz was trying to get him to pin down whether he was going to take the opinion or the position of a neutral public forum or as a political person expressing their own political bias because they know that if they take a stance in either of those directions, then they're not going to be able to try and straddle and do the globalist bidding by being authoritarians.
[02:24:41.343 --> 02:24:55.086]  Because essentially, you can't try and ban conservatives and then try and say you're a neutral public forum, see, but they don't want to go the political bias route because they don't want to be investigated for campaign financing for the Democrats.
[02:24:55.086 --> 02:25:02.267]  By essentially allowing Democrat public opinion to take over social media, they're campaigning for that.
[02:25:02.267 --> 02:25:05.368]  And it's already happened and the investigations have started and InfoWars' greatest work
[02:25:05.908 --> 02:25:09.890]  Longwooddrugsreport.com's greatest work in the last year has been forcing this out in the open.
[02:25:09.890 --> 02:25:13.432]  Now the debate has started, but Millie, what you said is critical.
[02:25:13.432 --> 02:25:19.015]  Google didn't show up because they're multinational, they've already moved to China, they're super arrogant.
[02:25:19.015 --> 02:25:29.560]  Congress, if they were smart, instead of sitting there doing, you know, when somebody interrupted one of the hearings, one of the congressmen did his auctioneer.
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:34.723]  Instead, they should have just had a Google assistant there, sitting there, and then asked Google assistant questions.
[02:25:36.508 --> 02:25:37.168]  Exactly.
[02:25:37.168 --> 02:26:04.403]  And what's interesting about these hearings is that these hearings are our own congressmen and women who have sold out to the globalists, primarily mostly Democrats, but also Republicans just like Marco Rubio, essentially pressuring social media big tech to do their bidding for them, acting as censors or authoritarian type regimes and saying that if you don't, we'll take you over.
[02:26:04.403 --> 02:26:05.524]  We'll take you over.
[02:26:06.786 --> 02:26:16.528]  Yeah, they're threatening to split them up, but what they're threatening is we'll split you up and control social media so that we can act as authoritarians if you're not going to do it for us.
[02:26:16.528 --> 02:26:28.611]  That's not really what Trump had in mind when he's talking about splitting up big tech, but we're seeing that it's a double-edged sword here because if the Democrats were to be in power and were to be regulating
[02:26:28.971 --> 02:26:30.392]  And let me break this down for people.
[02:26:30.392 --> 02:26:33.475]  You just said it perfectly clear, but I'll say it again and again and again.
[02:26:33.475 --> 02:26:34.716]  People go, Alex, aren't you libertarian?
[02:26:34.716 --> 02:26:35.557]  You don't want regulation.
[02:26:45.051 --> 02:26:49.957]  The First Amendment is a positive regulation saying you cannot infringe on it.
[02:26:49.957 --> 02:26:50.878]  It's there.
[02:26:50.878 --> 02:26:55.603]  So we need to have that enforced by the Republicans and Libertarians and Conservatives leaving a vacuum.
[02:26:55.603 --> 02:27:00.028]  The CHICOMS, the authoritarian EU, the Democrats.
[02:27:00.549 --> 02:27:08.593]  With Senator Warner's thing he put out six weeks ago saying, we're going to federalize Google and Facebook because you won't censor, and Twitter.
[02:27:08.593 --> 02:27:12.294]  And only Twitter said, no, we're not doing that.
[02:27:12.294 --> 02:27:16.096]  I can't believe I'm defending Twitter, but this pack of people, they are the best right now.
[02:27:16.716 --> 02:27:22.300]  And they have that survey, that internal survey that came out where 22% of Twitter says ban Alex Jones, the Twitter employees.
[02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:23.801]  It's 70 plus percent of Apple.
[02:27:23.801 --> 02:27:26.283]  So Apple is authoritarian and you're right.
[02:27:26.283 --> 02:27:31.967]  Senator Warren and Obama behind the scenes have set it up with big tech to ban me and then ban everybody else.
[02:27:31.967 --> 02:27:39.552]  And so it's not regulation, it's Trump not letting them discriminate and not letting them come in and ban people for their political views.
[02:27:39.552 --> 02:27:41.073]  It's the opposite of regulation.
[02:27:41.073 --> 02:27:42.314]  It's stopping regulations.
[02:27:43.712 --> 02:28:02.684]  Exactly, and what I will say is that I pulled a couple clips and put them aside, maybe the producers can play them for us when we come back on the other side of this break, of Sheryl Sandberg from Facebook, because some of the things that she says in this hearing on public record are so authoritarian, it literally sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie.
[02:28:02.684 --> 02:28:08.688]  She sounds like that big alien insect queen from the series V. It's just beyond creepy, Alex.
[02:28:09.264 --> 02:28:09.745]  No, you're right.
[02:28:09.745 --> 02:28:25.160]  When we come back from break, we'll play those and then take calls, because I was sitting in the hearing room when she would say this stuff, and it's like, we will look at that, we are scanning that, and we'll ban all of that, we are in control, yes, we're using psychological algorithms to control them, and you're just like, my God.
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:28.342]  These people have created a whole new communication system.
[02:28:28.342 --> 02:28:34.727]  We've all opted into it, and now they're selectively kicking us out and saying, oh, and we're going to kick you off the internet completely.
[02:28:34.727 --> 02:28:36.348]  And we've got your banking records.
[02:28:36.348 --> 02:28:38.110]  And we're tracking what you're doing in real time.
[02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:39.010]  And you will submit.
[02:28:39.010 --> 02:28:44.455]  And we've got Antifa on the street ready to hit you in the head with a club or bike lock or stab you.
[02:28:44.455 --> 02:28:47.837]  If you dare say no, then you become prominent to speak out.
[02:28:47.837 --> 02:28:49.779]  We'll just indict you as a Russian.
[02:28:49.779 --> 02:28:50.579]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:50.579 --> 02:28:50.980]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.563 --> 02:28:57.725]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[02:28:57.725 --> 02:28:58.505]  Not true.
[02:28:58.505 --> 02:29:00.347]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[02:29:00.347 --> 02:29:04.350]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?

[02:29:26.546 --> 02:29:30.468]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:30.468 --> 02:29:32.009]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:32.009 --> 02:29:34.971]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:34.971 --> 02:29:40.514]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:40.514 --> 02:29:41.715]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:41.715 --> 02:29:44.656]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:44.656 --> 02:29:46.878]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:32:59.169 --> 02:33:01.830]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:14.390]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:14.390 --> 02:33:22.913]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.913 --> 02:33:25.093]  Millie Weaver, InfoWars.com, Roving Reporter.
[02:33:25.093 --> 02:33:30.015]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in a few minutes, but she was covering and following the hearings in D.C.
[02:33:30.015 --> 02:33:38.357]  and how Orwellian they were, set up these clips we're about to play of the head spokesperson of Facebook, Zuckerberg's minion.
[02:33:40.990 --> 02:33:44.543]  So it's cheap operating officer.
[02:33:46.031 --> 02:34:01.717]  And basically, during the hearing yesterday where they were talking about foreign interference on social media and how that plays out with our elections, she goes on the most tyrannical, authoritarian tirade and power trip.
[02:34:01.717 --> 02:34:03.097]  It's pretty amazing to see.
[02:34:03.097 --> 02:34:06.898]  So we pulled a couple of clips from this eight hour long hearing for you guys.
[02:34:06.898 --> 02:34:08.999]  These are just little minute excerpts.
[02:34:08.999 --> 02:34:13.701]  I wanted to go to clip number two first, where she goes on her power trip and basically says,
[02:34:14.461 --> 02:34:17.863]  Well, you know what, let the clip speak for itself.
[02:34:17.863 --> 02:34:20.304]  Here it is.
[02:34:20.304 --> 02:34:21.944]  ...accounts from Russia.
[02:34:21.944 --> 02:34:32.048]  And just last week, we took down 58 pages and accounts from Myanmar, many of which were posing as news organizations.
[02:34:32.048 --> 02:34:37.791]  We are focused, as I know you are, on the upcoming US midterms and on elections around the world.
[02:34:39.065 --> 02:34:48.715]  Our efforts in recent elections from Germany to Italy to Mexico to the Alabama Special Senate election show us that the investments we are making are yielding results.
[02:34:52.765 --> 02:35:10.033]  Right there, she's admitting to the fact that social media plays a major role in our elections, and she's actually talking about how in other countries they're using their tools, algorithms, AI, shadow banning, to influence elections in other countries.
[02:35:10.033 --> 02:35:21.998]  But don't worry, she's doing it on behalf of Big Brother, Big Authoritarian Government, and she'll take commands from the Democrat globalists that are in office.
[02:35:22.598 --> 02:35:25.240]  I mean, if that doesn't creep you out, I don't know what does, Alex.
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:31.303]  And it's in the WikiLeaks and everywhere else that they're interfacing with the executives in real time and taking bad Hillary results out, you name it.
[02:35:31.303 --> 02:35:37.867]  Any populist, any nationalist, they're all being removed and being force-fed from Brazil to Germany.
[02:35:37.867 --> 02:35:41.929]  They're trying to stop populist candidates, trying to stop the will of the people.
[02:35:41.929 --> 02:35:44.610]  This is truly an authoritarian group of criminals.
[02:35:44.610 --> 02:35:47.112]  Let's continue.
[02:35:47.112 --> 02:35:49.253]  We cannot stop interference by ourselves.
[02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:55.311]  We're working with outside experts, industry, partners, and governments, including law enforcement.
[02:35:55.311 --> 02:35:56.671]  Hit pause again.
[02:35:56.671 --> 02:36:03.513]  We cannot stop interference with their plan, which is getting our guns, breaking up our families, doing all this.
[02:36:03.513 --> 02:36:05.994]  Continue.
[02:36:05.994 --> 02:36:08.075]  And prevent abuse.
[02:36:08.075 --> 02:36:16.238]  We're getting better at finding and stopping our opponents, from financially motivated troll farms to sophisticated military intelligence operations.
[02:36:17.657 --> 02:36:21.179]  We don't have access to the intelligence government have access to.
[02:36:21.179 --> 02:36:25.622]  So we don't always know exactly who is behind these attacks or their motives.
[02:36:25.622 --> 02:36:30.565]  And that's why we will continue working closely with law enforcement.
[02:36:30.565 --> 02:36:34.147]  Chairman Burr, I want to thank you for your leadership.
[02:36:34.147 --> 02:36:41.331]  Vice Chairman Warner, I want to thank you for your white paper, which has so many ideas on how we can work together to strengthen our defense.
[02:36:41.331 --> 02:36:41.912]  Let's stop again.
[02:36:42.679 --> 02:36:47.823]  That's the white paper he put out six weeks ago calling for me to be banned and calling for crushing conservatives.
[02:36:47.823 --> 02:36:51.365]  And then Senator Wyden and Senator Murphy said that's not enough.
[02:36:51.365 --> 02:36:58.910]  So that's him with a white paper threatening to federalize Google, Facebook, Apple, if they don't start censoring.
[02:36:58.910 --> 02:37:06.315]  And then two weeks later, two weeks later to the day, today's the 6th.
[02:37:06.315 --> 02:37:11.479]  It was on the 6th of last month, the 6th of August, now the 6th of September,
[02:37:12.335 --> 02:37:28.782]  That they de-platformed our 5 million views on our own channels on YouTube, our 5 million followers on Facebook, our 16 million people subscribed on our iTunes, all of it blown away because of his paper and what he wrote.
[02:37:28.782 --> 02:37:36.145]  And when you've researched it, it's horrifying, as Millie Weaver was just saying, to watch them admitting it all, Millie.
[02:37:36.145 --> 02:37:41.487]  That's what's crazy, is to watch how they have their own corporate speak and it's all out in the open.
[02:37:42.623 --> 02:38:06.365]  Exactly, and the fact that she's talking about how they're trying to prevent foreign interference in our elections, but she's demonstrating and talking about how they, Facebook, are taking it upon themselves to then meddle in elections and give the result that our government officials in the Democrat Party or the globalist movers and shakers want them to make.
[02:38:06.365 --> 02:38:08.167]  So she's actually admitting that
[02:38:08.667 --> 02:38:09.208]  We're good to go.
[02:38:27.185 --> 02:38:30.628]  In history in hearings before Congress right now.
[02:38:30.628 --> 02:38:44.760]  Another thing that's really telling and terrifying is that remember how I told you Alex how Facebook was planning to start implementing government issued ID verification programs on their platforms?
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:54.865]  Well, she actually announces that, but she announces that they're going to be starting with people who have large pages and large followings, and that's what clip number one is about.
[02:38:54.865 --> 02:38:55.786]  It's her announcing it.
[02:38:55.786 --> 02:38:55.946]  Exactly.
[02:38:55.946 --> 02:38:58.087]  They get financially tied into your bank account.
[02:38:58.087 --> 02:39:06.512]  That's the Chinese social score, or known in the Book of Revelations as the Mark of the Beast, because hypothetically, you could totally control populations with that.
[02:39:06.512 --> 02:39:08.012]  And again, Millie Weaver's on fire right now.
[02:39:08.012 --> 02:39:10.474]  We're going to go to your calls next segment, and the next segment after that.
[02:39:10.874 --> 02:39:12.096]  But this is what's happening.
[02:39:12.096 --> 02:39:13.639]  This is such a critical time.
[02:39:13.639 --> 02:39:14.760]  This is their takeover.
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:19.408]  And we know they want to ban Christians, conservatives, nationalists, free market folks.
[02:39:19.408 --> 02:39:22.232]  This is their evil takeover.
[02:39:22.232 --> 02:39:24.216]  Like Mark Zuckerberg said, thank God.
[02:39:25.347 --> 02:39:29.170]  Our users are so stupid, they're such dumb Fs.
[02:39:29.170 --> 02:39:31.572]  So, we told you this was coming, now it's been announced.
[02:39:31.572 --> 02:39:34.754]  They're fusing everything in to turn you off.
[02:39:34.754 --> 02:39:41.298]  You all just submit, but they're always going to raise the bar of how you've got to submit to this system of pure evil.
[02:39:41.298 --> 02:39:44.521]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[02:39:44.521 --> 02:39:48.784]  ... incentives to create it, and we're limiting the distribution it gets on Facebook.
[02:39:50.097 --> 02:39:53.801]  We demote articles rated by third-party fact-checkers as false.
[02:39:53.801 --> 02:39:54.501]  Start over again.
[02:39:54.501 --> 02:39:55.923]  This is so important.
[02:39:55.923 --> 02:40:08.795]  Southern Poverty Law Center, half-billion dollars offshore, works for Soros, Soros Media Matters, total criminal organization on record that admits they lie and sabotage, CNN and other criminal system, criminal news network.
[02:40:10.069 --> 02:40:11.950]  And again, though we use third parties.
[02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:16.634]  Well, hell, I can go start some third party and say this lady is a, you know, child molester.
[02:40:16.634 --> 02:40:17.835]  Doesn't mean she's a child molester.
[02:40:17.835 --> 02:40:21.297]  I can say she was, you know, Mother Teresa, too, with a third party site.
[02:40:21.297 --> 02:40:22.358]  That's not true either.
[02:40:22.358 --> 02:40:24.700]  Instead, she's just a corporate witch.
[02:40:24.700 --> 02:40:32.345]  But this is what we see is these cold-blooded monsters using technology against people and building this digital gulag that Matt Drudge warned of.
[02:40:32.345 --> 02:40:32.846]  Let's continue.
[02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:35.361]  Progress on fake news.
[02:40:35.361 --> 02:40:38.682]  We're getting rid of the economic incentives to create it.
[02:40:38.682 --> 02:40:42.404]  And we're limiting the distribution it gets on Facebook.
[02:40:42.404 --> 02:40:46.826]  We demote articles rated by third-party fact-checkers as false.
[02:40:46.826 --> 02:40:50.247]  We warn people who have shared them or who are about to share them.
[02:40:50.247 --> 02:40:53.289]  And we show them related articles to give them more facts.
[02:40:54.892 --> 02:40:56.832]  We've also taken strong steps.
[02:40:56.832 --> 02:41:01.233]  So we warn you, we watch what you're about to do in real time with AI and real people watching.
[02:41:01.233 --> 02:41:02.534]  Oh, looking over your shoulder.
[02:41:02.534 --> 02:41:03.614]  You're only going to make that phone call?
[02:41:03.614 --> 02:41:05.254]  We're not going to send that letter?
[02:41:05.254 --> 02:41:08.335]  Like authoritarian regimes read your letters?
[02:41:08.335 --> 02:41:11.596]  And then we financially don't let you advertise if you do that.
[02:41:11.596 --> 02:41:14.717]  And then we ban you.
[02:41:14.717 --> 02:41:18.577]  So again, she is just admitting flagrant authoritarianism.
[02:41:18.577 --> 02:41:20.158]  Continue.
[02:41:20.158 --> 02:41:20.778]  And more facts.
[02:41:22.398 --> 02:41:28.102]  We've also taken strong steps to prevent abuse and increase transparency in advertising.
[02:41:28.102 --> 02:41:35.267]  Today on Facebook, you can go to any page and see all the ads that page is running, even if they wouldn't be shown to you.
[02:41:35.267 --> 02:41:43.533]  For political and issue ads, you can also see who paid for the ads, how much was spent, and the demographics of the people who saw them.
[02:41:43.533 --> 02:41:51.799]  We're also going to require people running large pages with large audiences in the United States to go through an authorization process and confirm their identity.
[02:41:52.728 --> 02:41:53.649]  Boom, there you have it.
[02:41:53.649 --> 02:41:56.092]  These steps won't stop everyone who's trying to game this game.
[02:42:09.341 --> 02:42:33.807]  Okay, so this is exactly what I said was going to happen when you had me on right after InfoWars and Alex Jones' YouTube and Facebook pages got pulled from my intelligence source that was saying that this is all the plan and they're going to roll out this government-issued ID verification program for social media and they're already starting it now on Facebook, but only for pages that have large followings.
[02:42:33.807 --> 02:42:35.047]  That's what she's announcing here.
[02:42:36.363 --> 02:42:42.690]  And by the way, I wasn't mad at you, it's just YouTube, because it's such a, it's an eight hour clip, we can't download it and play it on the computer, our system won't do it.
[02:42:42.690 --> 02:42:46.414]  So they're having to like, start and stop, and it's just, YouTube drives me crazy.
[02:42:46.414 --> 02:42:49.417]  But we're playing this, and just, she makes me physically sick.

[02:43:56.252 --> 02:43:57.692]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[02:43:57.692 --> 02:44:10.958]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[02:44:10.958 --> 02:44:21.583]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[02:44:22.363 --> 02:44:23.123]  We're good to go!
[02:44:51.556 --> 02:44:53.118]  This is the verboten info.
[02:44:53.118 --> 02:44:56.661]  This is what they don't want you to see.

[02:46:53.120 --> 02:46:59.087]  Regrets, I've had a few
[02:47:14.848 --> 02:47:23.235]  All right, I got 20 phone calls that I want to go to, and we've got Anthony Kumian coming up to host the next hour, so let's take these calls from Millie Weaver.
[02:47:23.235 --> 02:47:38.087]  But watching these hearings, and watching Senator Warner and his just authoritarian evil, and how these globalists that have sold the country out then project onto all of us and Trump that we're Russian agents, it's sick.
[02:47:38.087 --> 02:47:41.610]  And they've got Mueller 100% planning to frame me for Russia.
[02:47:42.648 --> 02:47:46.729]  It's like framing me for being the Loch Ness Monster.
[02:47:46.729 --> 02:47:51.651]  But they mean business, and that's how they plan to go after thousands of Americans.
[02:47:51.651 --> 02:48:02.895]  They plan a whole reign of terror in America, just disappearing and arresting people once Trump's out, saying, you're with the Russians when they're the globalists that hate America.
[02:48:02.895 --> 02:48:03.795]  Billy, we're going to calls.
[02:48:03.795 --> 02:48:05.096]  I want you to ride shotgun with me.
[02:48:05.096 --> 02:48:07.877]  A little bit in the next hour, then Anthony Comey is taking over.
[02:48:07.877 --> 02:48:10.598]  We're going to have Jeremiah and Tim and Todd here in a moment.
[02:48:12.145 --> 02:48:14.547]  This has gotten so epic, I don't even know what to say.
[02:48:14.547 --> 02:48:17.849]  I mean, I just, it's all happening.
[02:48:17.849 --> 02:48:20.891]  And imagine if we had more people like Trump in Congress.
[02:48:20.891 --> 02:48:21.632]  We have so few.
[02:48:25.131 --> 02:48:39.579]  Well, you know, Alex, I wonder if part of the reason the NFL ratings have dropped by 10% actually has to do with how interesting all of this political action and political hearings and debates and stuff has ramped up.
[02:48:39.579 --> 02:48:45.943]  I mean, the hearings between the Kavanaugh hearings and then this Twitter, social media, Facebook hearing.
[02:48:46.543 --> 02:48:49.124]  This stuff is just whip out the popcorn.
[02:48:49.124 --> 02:48:51.245]  It is so interesting to watch.
[02:48:51.245 --> 02:48:59.267]  And yes, some of it is infuriating to watch when you're just watching blatant liars and corrupt swamp creatures spewing their lies.
[02:48:59.267 --> 02:49:04.789]  But at the same time, it's also very interesting and it's a fight for our country, really.
[02:49:04.789 --> 02:49:13.412]  And so the Nike stuff is really kind of overshadowed in a lot of ways by what's going on in these hearings right now.
[02:49:13.772 --> 02:49:19.137]  Well sure, and that's a 34% drop in popularity of Nike.
[02:49:19.137 --> 02:49:21.899]  Billions of dollars, 3.7 billion lost just in one day.
[02:49:22.981 --> 02:49:30.045]  And that's 10% drop just in the last few weeks from the NFL from the 30% drop in the two years before.
[02:49:30.045 --> 02:49:32.387]  So we're almost at 40% drop.
[02:49:32.387 --> 02:49:35.188]  I just think people are sick of it all, Millie, but I agree.
[02:49:35.188 --> 02:49:42.172]  People are getting into politics and that's so much more interesting when it's real and it's not just two parties acting like they're opposing each other.
[02:49:42.172 --> 02:49:43.893]  We're in time of major change.
[02:49:43.893 --> 02:49:46.015]  Okay, let's go to who's up first here.
[02:49:46.815 --> 02:49:47.636]  Is it Todd?
[02:49:47.636 --> 02:49:48.216]  Is it Tim?
[02:49:48.216 --> 02:49:48.997]  Is it Jeremiah?
[02:49:48.997 --> 02:49:49.977]  Is it Clinton?
[02:49:49.977 --> 02:49:51.938]  Let's go ahead and go to Jeremiah in Virginia.
[02:49:51.938 --> 02:49:52.899]  You're on the air, Jeremiah.
[02:49:52.899 --> 02:49:54.700]  Thanks for calling.
[02:49:54.700 --> 02:49:56.161]  What's going on, Alex?
[02:49:56.161 --> 02:49:58.283]  Crazy days, my friend.
[02:49:58.283 --> 02:49:58.703]  I know.
[02:49:58.703 --> 02:50:00.224]  I get you.
[02:50:00.224 --> 02:50:05.708]  What I want to say is first is that I'm a Lyft driver, and I play your show all the time.
[02:50:05.708 --> 02:50:08.529]  The InfoWars app is awesome, man.
[02:50:08.529 --> 02:50:11.912]  I drive all the time, and people ask, what am I listening to?
[02:50:11.912 --> 02:50:13.092]  And I tell them, Alex Jones.
[02:50:13.092 --> 02:50:13.893]  You ever hear about it?
[02:50:14.617 --> 02:50:16.739]  And some people have, some people haven't.
[02:50:16.739 --> 02:50:18.581]  And I push it, Alex.
[02:50:18.581 --> 02:50:19.121]  I do.
[02:50:19.121 --> 02:50:23.445]  And that's what I'm trying to say as well, is that everybody needs to push this.
[02:50:23.445 --> 02:50:26.667]  Not just you, not just your crew, everybody.
[02:50:26.667 --> 02:50:28.369]  Everybody needs to get involved.
[02:50:28.369 --> 02:50:36.676]  And, you know, back when King George, we were fighting against King George, we became together as a country.
[02:50:36.676 --> 02:50:39.719]  We just, we came together and we became those Minutemen.
[02:50:39.719 --> 02:50:42.141]  And we got to rise up again and become those Minutemen again.
[02:50:42.759 --> 02:50:44.559]  And so we all have to get involved.
[02:50:44.559 --> 02:50:49.320]  And thanks to you and the crew, it's all... Well, let me say thanks to you, brother.
[02:50:49.320 --> 02:50:51.621]  It's the crew and the listeners that make it all possible.
[02:50:51.621 --> 02:50:52.441]  And I'm not just saying that.
[02:50:52.441 --> 02:50:53.141]  It's the truth.
[02:50:53.141 --> 02:50:54.261]  But God bless you.
[02:50:54.261 --> 02:50:54.902]  Thank you.
[02:50:54.902 --> 02:50:57.302]  Yeah, just spread Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:50:57.302 --> 02:50:59.783]  It's got all the links to the free podcast, the live feeds.
[02:50:59.783 --> 02:51:01.403]  We're going to have a lot of new functions there.
[02:51:01.403 --> 02:51:06.004]  But this corrupt system is coming down on us like a hammer.
[02:51:06.824 --> 02:51:10.365]  Right now, because they know they're losing control.
[02:51:10.365 --> 02:51:12.065]  And if you go to D.C.
[02:51:12.065 --> 02:51:23.308]  and go into those meeting rooms and look at the establishment, they are pathetic little lawyer peacocks of corruption that just want to sit up there on their little pedestal.
[02:51:23.308 --> 02:51:25.589]  And you realize how pathetic they are.
[02:51:25.589 --> 02:51:26.129]  God bless you.
[02:51:26.129 --> 02:51:26.729]  Anything else, Jeremiah?
[02:51:27.589 --> 02:51:36.115]  Yeah, I wanted to say also, I mean, Mark Warner is just, Senator, he was, I'm in Virginia, he was my governor, and even then he wasn't a great governor.
[02:51:36.115 --> 02:51:44.440]  And so I don't know, I didn't vote for him, I don't know how he got into the Senate, but it's just, man, what he's trying to do is come after you and come after the President.
[02:51:45.601 --> 02:51:47.762]  Mueller, they have no game.
[02:51:47.762 --> 02:51:50.402]  They have nothing to go after the president with.
[02:51:50.402 --> 02:51:58.584]  Back when Clinton and Obama, think of all the things Obama and Hillary was doing, and yet they're still not in prison yet.
[02:51:58.584 --> 02:52:02.665]  And yet they're trying to dig and find this information on Trump, and they got nothing.
[02:52:02.665 --> 02:52:03.745]  They can't do anything.
[02:52:03.745 --> 02:52:07.966]  And the thing is, Alex, is that you know how they shut you down.
[02:52:09.234 --> 02:52:15.838]  If they try anything to shut down the president even more, because even just when they shut down his Twitter, everybody blew up.
[02:52:17.421 --> 02:52:22.282]  It's just like you said, if you strike me down, I will become more powerful than I've ever been.
[02:52:22.282 --> 02:52:24.543]  And that's exactly what's going to happen to Trump.
[02:52:24.543 --> 02:52:27.123]  And they can't do it.
[02:52:27.123 --> 02:52:32.925]  That's even why Hayden and Panetta said, you can't get rid of Trump with an economy like this.
[02:52:32.925 --> 02:52:33.365]  Don't do it.
[02:52:33.365 --> 02:52:34.725]  It's even more dangerous than him.
[02:52:34.725 --> 02:52:36.666]  But a bunch of them can't stop.
[02:52:36.666 --> 02:52:37.446]  That's a great point.
[02:52:37.446 --> 02:52:38.826]  Millie, thank you, Jeremiah.
[02:52:38.826 --> 02:52:42.427]  That's a great point, though, that I've been trying to make, that even smarter members of the establishment go.
[02:52:42.947 --> 02:52:45.088]  Listen, you can't take this guy out now.
[02:52:45.088 --> 02:52:45.809]  What are you thinking?
[02:52:45.809 --> 02:52:49.191]  There's going to be an even bigger reaction to that.
[02:52:49.191 --> 02:52:53.313]  Alright.
[02:52:53.313 --> 02:52:55.915]  Alright, Millie's having a problem with her Skype.
[02:52:55.915 --> 02:52:57.595]  That's what was happening earlier that made me angry.
[02:52:57.595 --> 02:53:00.677]  We're going to go back to her in just a minute as soon as it catches back up.
[02:53:00.677 --> 02:53:04.599]  Let's go ahead and go to Todd in Arizona.
[02:53:04.599 --> 02:53:06.240]  You're on the air with Millie Weaver and Alex Jones.
[02:53:06.240 --> 02:53:06.921]  Thank you for calling, sir.
[02:53:07.981 --> 02:53:20.332]  Hi, I think that the intelligence organizations have agents that are embedded in other parts of the government and also that they pay money to people in industry and in the media.
[02:53:20.332 --> 02:53:27.538]  I was hoping that Trump could start to dismantle some of that government secrecy and bring transparency by
[02:53:28.518 --> 02:53:29.599]  We're good to go.
[02:53:49.505 --> 02:53:53.827]  That would help level the playing field.
[02:53:53.827 --> 02:53:58.849]  You've got a bunch of leftists that have been in intelligence agencies that are called stay-behind networks.
[02:53:58.849 --> 02:54:01.430]  So they're in the government sabotaging what Trump does.
[02:54:01.430 --> 02:54:08.634]  So I think what you're getting at is how do we expose them and how do we get them to stop what they're doing and emboldening all this criminal activity.
[02:54:08.634 --> 02:54:09.954]  That's a great point, Todd.
[02:54:09.954 --> 02:54:11.595]  Thank you.
[02:54:11.595 --> 02:54:12.695]  Millie, you were making another point.
[02:54:12.695 --> 02:54:13.396]  Is your Skype back?
[02:54:13.396 --> 02:54:13.676]  Go ahead.
[02:54:14.929 --> 02:54:35.415]  Well, I was just going to touch on what he just said here and really when it comes down to draining the swamp, it's just going to be a matter of exposing who these people are because it's a reality and a game that's played where a lot of times you don't know who the leakers are, you don't know necessarily who some of these swamp creatures are until it's too late.
[02:54:35.415 --> 02:54:40.616]  But it'll be a matter of exposing them and then doing whatever you can to either vote them out of office
[02:54:41.276 --> 02:54:49.320]  Or elect officials who can appoint people in their cabinet who are going to be legitimate.
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:51.701]  It's so dirty in Washington, though.
[02:54:51.701 --> 02:54:52.121]  Here's the deal.
[02:54:52.121 --> 02:54:55.262]  The New York Times is famous for fake sources.
[02:54:55.262 --> 02:54:58.804]  And so Nikki Haley, Huntsman, yeah.
[02:54:59.144 --> 02:55:00.184]  They're all talking trash.
[02:55:00.184 --> 02:55:01.205]  They're all swamp creatures.
[02:55:01.205 --> 02:55:06.267]  They all stabbed the president in the back, behind his back, just like McMaster did.
[02:55:06.267 --> 02:55:08.888]  But this New York Times thing is all the famous talking points.
[02:55:08.888 --> 02:55:17.311]  You can see it's been professionally written as a talking point blueprint for the rest of fake news, just as the drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, 60 days out.
[02:55:17.311 --> 02:55:20.752]  All right, let's take another phone call here as we go to break.
[02:55:20.752 --> 02:55:23.113]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Montana.
[02:55:23.113 --> 02:55:23.833]  You're on the air, Tim.
[02:55:23.833 --> 02:55:25.394]  Thanks for holding.
[02:55:25.394 --> 02:55:26.414]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:55:26.414 --> 02:55:27.475]  I just wanted to say I am
[02:55:29.358 --> 02:55:30.759]  Fully animated.
[02:55:30.759 --> 02:55:34.520]  President Trump's going to be landing here in Billings in just a few short hours.
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:36.841]  I'm on the phone with the tip of the spear.
[02:55:36.841 --> 02:55:37.921]  Life couldn't get any better.
[02:55:37.921 --> 02:55:41.363]  I mean, do you want tomorrow's news today?
[02:55:41.363 --> 02:55:42.383]  Listen to you.
[02:55:42.383 --> 02:55:50.066]  Two years ago, about this time of year, when President Trump was campaigning, you had said, we win either way.
[02:55:50.066 --> 02:55:53.027]  If he gets in office and enacts his policies, we win.
[02:55:53.027 --> 02:55:57.149]  And if he doesn't win, he's going to expose the corruption.
[02:55:58.198 --> 02:56:01.039]  We get, I mean, we've gotten double the pot.
[02:56:01.039 --> 02:56:02.140]  I mean, he won.
[02:56:02.140 --> 02:56:03.861]  He's exposing the corruption.
[02:56:03.861 --> 02:56:09.143]  If they move against him, there's going to be an insurrection the likes of the world has never seen.
[02:56:09.143 --> 02:56:10.063]  I love his new tweet.
[02:56:10.063 --> 02:56:11.504]  I didn't see this from yesterday.
[02:56:11.504 --> 02:56:14.545]  I'm draining the swamp and the swamp is trying to fight back.
[02:56:14.545 --> 02:56:15.486]  Don't worry, we will win.
[02:56:15.486 --> 02:56:16.386]  It's true.
[02:56:16.386 --> 02:56:17.347]  I mean, it's so epic.
[02:56:17.347 --> 02:56:19.588]  So I tend to get negative and get down.
[02:56:19.588 --> 02:56:21.429]  But thanks to you, Chris.
[02:56:21.429 --> 02:56:22.369]  Thanks to all the listeners.
[02:56:22.369 --> 02:56:24.130]  Thanks to Millie and this great group putting up with me.
[02:56:24.770 --> 02:56:25.771]  I think we're going to make it through it.
[02:56:25.771 --> 02:56:26.852]  I think you're absolutely right.
[02:56:26.852 --> 02:56:30.915]  And I think if you were listening this time last year, I was saying the polls are fake.
[02:56:30.915 --> 02:56:31.736]  Trump's going to win.
[02:56:31.736 --> 02:56:33.157]  Remember that?
[02:56:33.157 --> 02:56:33.898]  Oh, yeah.
[02:56:33.898 --> 02:56:35.379]  My wife denied the election.
[02:56:35.379 --> 02:56:37.101]  She said, you know, he's not going to win.
[02:56:37.101 --> 02:56:37.781]  I said, you know what?
[02:56:37.781 --> 02:56:38.202]  We'll see.
[02:56:38.202 --> 02:56:39.282]  I said, that's not what I hear.
[02:56:39.282 --> 02:56:40.904]  I said, I think he's going to win.
[02:56:41.730 --> 02:56:43.611]  And she said, well, I voted for him, but he's not going to win.
[02:56:43.611 --> 02:56:44.251]  I said, we'll see.
[02:56:44.251 --> 02:56:47.172]  I said, I think I think people are being misled.
[02:56:47.172 --> 02:56:48.633]  You were spot on.
[02:56:48.633 --> 02:57:01.779]  You know, I felt I felt like ever since I found you several years ago with an interview with Dave Mustaine, I felt like all of a sudden I've got this brother in arms that understands the world the same way I understand it.
[02:57:01.779 --> 02:57:08.002]  And we're shoulder to shoulder, you know, on the on the line, getting ready to, you know, just take the truth to people.
[02:57:08.002 --> 02:57:08.902]  And, you know, it's
[02:57:09.565 --> 02:57:15.308]  I just, and I try to tell people this all the time, social media is satanic.
[02:57:15.308 --> 02:57:24.271]  It isolates the human spirit under the guise of... Oh, even the former head of Facebook, Sean Parker, said it's designed to make you depressed under their control.
[02:57:24.271 --> 02:57:25.652]  So break free!
[02:57:25.652 --> 02:57:26.952]  Go to your own public meetings.
[02:57:26.952 --> 02:57:28.273]  Go to Congress yourself.
[02:57:28.273 --> 02:57:29.934]  You know, go in the hearings yourself.
[02:57:29.934 --> 02:57:31.434]  Talk to the news cameras yourself.
[02:57:31.434 --> 02:57:32.415]  Do your own streams.
[02:57:32.415 --> 02:57:33.235]  You're leaders.
[02:57:33.235 --> 02:57:33.975]  You are the answer.
[02:57:33.975 --> 02:57:34.796]  God bless you.
[02:57:34.796 --> 02:57:35.336]  We'll come back.
[02:57:35.336 --> 02:57:36.196]  Thanks, Tim and Montana.
[02:57:36.196 --> 02:57:37.017]  We'll come back with more calls.
[02:57:38.268 --> 02:57:44.759]  There's a paradox he made me think of that I had in my mind and it left me, but there's a real paradox here that we need to talk about.
[02:57:50.293 --> 02:57:52.655]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:58:53.591 --> 02:58:54.072]  It's you!

[02:58:57.674 --> 02:58:59.056]  You are the InfoWard.
[02:58:59.056 --> 02:59:01.919]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:16.315 --> 02:59:27.700]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[02:59:35.684 --> 02:59:42.728]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:42.728 --> 02:59:45.469]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[02:59:49.733 --> 03:00:00.395]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.395 --> 03:00:02.936]  Eric in Montana says drain the swamp before the midterms.
[03:00:02.936 --> 03:00:03.596]  I agree.
[03:00:03.596 --> 03:00:05.216]  Trump has to strike back hard.
[03:00:05.216 --> 03:00:10.137]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:00:10.137 --> 03:00:13.518]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.518 --> 03:00:15.979]  Chris says Trump needs a game plan.
[03:00:15.979 --> 03:00:16.599]  I mean he needs
[03:00:17.608 --> 03:00:22.691]  To be addressing the nation, say, every Wednesday night and just laying it out, not just in tweets.
[03:00:22.691 --> 03:00:39.763]  He needs to fire up his notes, get in there, do 30 minutes, and have five or six people come in and sit down from business or life or teachers or military and talk to them about what they want unscripted and just say, what do you want?
[03:00:39.763 --> 03:00:41.504]  You want prosperity and freedom or you want this evil?
[03:00:44.053 --> 03:00:49.858]  But man, the swamp is fighting back so hard right now.
[03:00:49.858 --> 03:00:53.061]  And when they take Trump out of their successful, they plan to take everything else out.
[03:00:53.061 --> 03:00:53.862]  They're going to end it all.
[03:00:53.862 --> 03:01:01.228]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Eric in Montana.
[03:01:01.228 --> 03:01:02.390]  You're on the air with Millie Weaver.
[03:01:02.390 --> 03:01:02.650]  Go ahead.
[03:01:04.845 --> 03:01:06.326]  Hello, sir.
[03:01:06.326 --> 03:01:11.249]  I've got my Trump shirt on, getting ready to go see him here in a couple hours.
[03:01:11.249 --> 03:01:17.892]  And I just wanted to say that if the criminals do not go to jail, the swamp will never be drained.
[03:01:17.892 --> 03:01:22.675]  That's right, and the criminals are so emboldened and so arrogant.
[03:01:22.675 --> 03:01:23.976]  Exactly.
[03:01:23.976 --> 03:01:29.279]  If there is no justice, then the corruption will keep going and going and going forever.
[03:01:30.506 --> 03:01:31.607]  Well, how does he drain the swamp?
[03:01:31.607 --> 03:01:42.158]  He's fighting hard right now, and he thought if he turned the economy back on, people would get behind him, which they have partially, but that's only made the swamp fight harder, knowing their time is almost over.
[03:01:42.158 --> 03:01:42.498]  Exactly.
[03:01:42.498 --> 03:01:43.059]  It's like you said.
[03:01:43.059 --> 03:01:44.961]  I mean, no quarters are being given.
[03:01:44.961 --> 03:01:47.223]  I mean, you gave them a chance.
[03:01:47.223 --> 03:01:48.444]  They're not taking it.
[03:01:48.444 --> 03:01:48.944]  It's time to...
[03:01:49.867 --> 03:01:50.147]  Unbelievable.
[03:01:50.147 --> 03:01:50.727]  God bless you, Eric.
[03:01:50.727 --> 03:01:51.608]  I appreciate your call.
[03:01:51.608 --> 03:01:53.309]  Milly, you want to comment on that before we go to Chris?
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:25.264]  Yeah, you know, when Trump's, when we read Trump's tweet about draining the swamp, I just visualized Trump running around like Ghostbusters trying to fight the swamp creatures and then fighting back just like in the Ghostbusters movie.
[03:02:25.264 --> 03:02:30.645]  We need to do like a little take on it like Swampbusters or something because it's just,
[03:02:33.081 --> 03:02:36.982]  Washington is so inundated with these swamp creatures.
[03:02:36.982 --> 03:02:39.963]  It's just so slimy and grimy.
[03:02:39.963 --> 03:02:43.784]  He needs to go in there with like a Roto-Rooter or something.
[03:02:43.784 --> 03:02:46.925]  It's gonna be a big task and he needs our help as well.
[03:02:46.925 --> 03:02:48.226]  He can't just do it on his own.
[03:02:49.531 --> 03:02:50.231]  Absolutely.
[03:02:50.231 --> 03:02:53.332]  Well, you know, they just intimidate other people who aren't even inherently evil.
[03:02:53.332 --> 03:02:58.634]  They just threaten them, the people that work in D.C., and they just roll over and try to play both sides.
[03:02:58.634 --> 03:03:06.437]  We've just raised a generation of yes-men, and we've got to bring back the old leadership, the old classic men that do what's right, women that do what's right.
[03:03:06.437 --> 03:03:08.478]  We're doing it together, like you said.
[03:03:08.478 --> 03:03:10.058]  Chris in Tennessee, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:03:10.058 --> 03:03:11.059]  Anthony Comey is coming up.
[03:03:11.059 --> 03:03:12.859]  Go ahead.
[03:03:12.859 --> 03:03:14.020]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:03:15.186 --> 03:03:21.271]  Man, we had an epic day yesterday, but it got crowned off with some unbelievable stuff I can't get into yet, so just stay tuned for that.
[03:03:21.271 --> 03:03:29.417]  But the Swamp is launching its counteroffensive like Jeb Dietrich at the Battle of the Bulge.
[03:03:29.417 --> 03:03:30.898]  Oh man, I look up to you so much.
[03:03:30.898 --> 03:03:38.044]  So I guess real quick, I have a two-part question, but just to say first, I've been raised on you, Alex.
[03:03:38.044 --> 03:03:39.265]  My dad was big into you.
[03:03:39.265 --> 03:03:41.646]  We buy your products, even lately.
[03:03:41.646 --> 03:03:43.007]  I love the Brain Force Plus.
[03:03:44.767 --> 03:03:45.527]  Love it all, man.
[03:03:45.527 --> 03:03:58.193]  And I guess my main question is, when it comes to Trump and then the censorship you guys are facing, which is outrageous, I was wondering, you announced you're going on Rogue, and I was wondering what we can expect from that.
[03:03:58.193 --> 03:04:06.076]  And the first part is, what's your game plan you're going to try to get across on that platform as far as the censorship and Trump's removal?
[03:04:06.076 --> 03:04:08.777]  And the second part of the question is, do you think YouTube will ban Joe?
[03:04:08.777 --> 03:04:10.178]  Do you think they'll remove that video?
[03:04:11.107 --> 03:04:17.615]  No, I mean, I think they know that'll be too obvious, because Joe has one of the biggest shows for press, real TV, radio, you name it.
[03:04:17.615 --> 03:04:22.101]  And when I was on, like, 45 million viewers, that was the biggest podcast he ever had up to that date.
[03:04:22.101 --> 03:04:24.023]  And he's had a few that were bigger now.
[03:04:24.023 --> 03:04:25.285]  So we're going to see what happens.
[03:04:25.285 --> 03:04:26.366]  It's in late September.
[03:04:26.366 --> 03:04:27.707]  We haven't nailed down the exact date.
[03:04:28.428 --> 03:04:29.409]  Uh, but that's going to be coming up.
[03:04:29.409 --> 03:04:30.229]  But stay there, Chris.
[03:04:30.229 --> 03:04:35.953]  Let me get a final comment, along with Millie, before we hand the baton to Anthony Cumia, who is really wound up and ready to go, loaded for bear.
[03:04:35.953 --> 03:04:38.395]  But I want to finish up with you and all the other callers.
[03:04:38.395 --> 03:04:41.697]  Boy, there's Matthew and Lance and Robert and Ethan and everybody else.
[03:04:41.697 --> 03:04:44.039]  And Dan and Larry and Joan.
[03:04:44.039 --> 03:04:48.122]  I want to try to get to you, but the problem is time.
[03:04:48.122 --> 03:04:48.722]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:48.722 --> 03:04:49.743]  We may be able to get to some more.
[03:04:49.743 --> 03:04:52.365]  Let me talk to Anthony Cumia of Compound Media.
[03:04:54.428 --> 03:04:56.769]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:06:21.246 --> 03:06:23.752]  All right, Anthony Comey of Compound Media.
[03:06:23.752 --> 03:06:25.577]  Banned from Pressful Radio because he's number one.
[03:06:25.577 --> 03:06:27.040]  Banned from XM because he's number one.
[03:06:28.353 --> 03:06:32.096]  Because he wasn't a... He said it was wrong to kill cops.
[03:06:32.096 --> 03:06:35.898]  He said people shooting cops in the back of the head are animals.
[03:06:35.898 --> 03:06:36.819]  And then he got banned.
[03:06:36.819 --> 03:06:38.000]  They're like, oh, you're being racist.
[03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:41.982]  I don't care if you're white or black, you shoot anybody that's in the back of the head, you're worse than animals.
[03:06:41.982 --> 03:06:43.724]  It's like calling MS-13 animals.
[03:06:43.724 --> 03:06:44.524]  They go, how dare you?
[03:06:44.524 --> 03:06:45.945]  They're God's children.
[03:06:45.945 --> 03:06:51.049]  I don't care if it's the KKK killing somebody, or MS-13, you know, they're animals.
[03:06:51.049 --> 03:06:52.029]  Or worse than animals.
[03:06:52.029 --> 03:06:54.491]  But he's taking over here just a minute.
[03:06:54.491 --> 03:06:55.852]  I wanted to finish up with Chris.
[03:06:57.657 --> 03:06:59.877]  I mean, Chris was getting into a Trump game plan.
[03:06:59.877 --> 03:07:04.058]  Millie, what do you think Trump should do with 60 days left here?
[03:07:04.058 --> 03:07:09.339]  Well, I think he really needs to desperately drain the swamp, and it's not going to be easy.
[03:07:09.339 --> 03:07:13.880]  But if he doesn't do it, the swamp's going to start to drain him and the people around him.
[03:07:13.880 --> 03:07:16.220]  I mean, I don't know if you noticed this.
[03:07:16.220 --> 03:07:26.982]  I'm sure everyone else has noticed that there seems to be an unequal application of the law and justice, where anyone who's a Democrat or globalist
[03:07:27.142 --> 03:07:29.324]  By the way, all he says in 2003, because we're in the White House, that
[03:07:56.343 --> 03:07:57.864]  Roe v. Wade wasn't settled yet.
[03:07:57.864 --> 03:07:59.625]  Well, it wasn't settled at that time.
[03:07:59.625 --> 03:08:01.267]  Since then, they've had it all litigated out.
[03:08:01.267 --> 03:08:03.828]  It's been settled, at least at that point.
[03:08:03.828 --> 03:08:09.753]  And then the other one was him, you know, talking about how they make race the only thing for an applicant.
[03:08:09.753 --> 03:08:12.935]  He said it ought to be a wide spectrum of things, which I think we all agree with.
[03:08:12.935 --> 03:08:19.880]  So even these secret documents they leaked, you know, why doesn't Trump release all the stuff on Hillary and just get it out of the way?
[03:08:19.880 --> 03:08:20.560]  I agree.
[03:08:20.560 --> 03:08:25.524]  You drain the swamp by releasing all the documents on Hillary, on the former head of the FBI, on Mueller.
[03:08:26.344 --> 03:08:30.387]  And he goes ahead and fires Sessions and fires all these people.
[03:08:30.387 --> 03:08:35.291]  And he goes ahead and gets rid of the CIA office that Obama set up to run the media.
[03:08:35.291 --> 03:08:38.234]  Those are the stay-behind networks that have to be dealt with.
[03:08:38.234 --> 03:08:41.156]  Anything else, Chris?
[03:08:41.156 --> 03:08:54.006]  Yeah, I guess just to recap, the removal of Trump and the whole censorship, especially with you guys, but now, like you said, everybody, like I said, I've been a fan of you.
[03:08:54.707 --> 03:08:56.488]  I don't think there's any beef with Joe.
[03:08:56.488 --> 03:08:56.948]  My issue is...
[03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:24.575]  He was just repeating what media said about me on issues of disinfo that I didn't say.
[03:09:24.575 --> 03:09:30.239]  So I was just getting frustrated because in a media war, it'd be good to be able to get on a show.
[03:09:30.239 --> 03:09:31.700]  But he called me and said, I want you on.
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:33.542]  He goes, I'm just sick of all the controversy.
[03:09:33.542 --> 03:09:35.023]  I just want to cover a wide range of topics.
[03:09:35.023 --> 03:09:36.944]  I don't want to be in the middle of this stuff.
[03:09:36.944 --> 03:09:38.365]  But he said, you know, I've been sucked into it.
[03:09:38.365 --> 03:09:39.806]  So please come on anyways.
[03:09:39.806 --> 03:09:41.287]  So I think that's what it comes down to.
[03:09:41.287 --> 03:09:44.750]  But I look forward to being on there if I'm not been arrested.
[03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:46.131]  And I'm not just saying that, folks.
[03:09:47.606 --> 03:09:52.409]  Mueller is literally asking dozens of people about me.
[03:09:52.409 --> 03:09:54.390]  He's got goons following me around.
[03:09:54.390 --> 03:09:56.051]  They're getting in my trash.
[03:09:56.051 --> 03:10:00.894]  They are doing stuff yesterday that was so over the top.
[03:10:00.894 --> 03:10:02.935]  They sent somebody I know very well to me.
[03:10:03.789 --> 03:10:06.351]  And I'm sitting there, I'm like, hang on, I'm in a hurry, I have to get out of here.
[03:10:06.351 --> 03:10:09.332]  And they're like, listen, the Russians want to give you millions of dollars.
[03:10:09.332 --> 03:10:10.513]  And here's who it is.
[03:10:10.513 --> 03:10:11.413]  And I'm like, what?
[03:10:11.413 --> 03:10:11.954]  No way!
[03:10:11.954 --> 03:10:12.654]  What is this?
[03:10:12.654 --> 03:10:14.655]  Oh no, it's really good, you need to do it.
[03:10:14.655 --> 03:10:17.177]  And I mean, it's so obvious!
[03:10:17.177 --> 03:10:18.097]  My God!
[03:10:18.097 --> 03:10:20.559]  I mean, it's like I'm living in a crime novel or something.
[03:10:20.559 --> 03:10:23.640]  Because they're so desperate to shut me down.
[03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:24.601]  It's unbelievable.
[03:10:24.601 --> 03:10:25.922]  Millie Weaver, great job.
[03:10:25.922 --> 03:10:26.742]  Chris, God bless you.
[03:10:26.742 --> 03:10:27.563]  Sorry, the other callers.
[03:10:28.423 --> 03:10:39.475]  If you want to get all their numbers, John, tomorrow, I promise I'll call them back and put them on air, because I feel bad when we... That's the only problem having a phone system with, you know, 50 phone lines we can have to hang up on so many, but God bless everybody.
[03:10:39.475 --> 03:10:40.896]  And I'm not trying to be dramatic here.
[03:10:40.896 --> 03:10:42.878]  I'm going to have to talk about this, okay?
[03:10:44.065 --> 03:10:54.176]  Because either this was Mueller and a national security letter dropped on a group ordering them to go in and do this, or people are just crazy town.
[03:10:54.176 --> 03:10:59.841]  But I will not wait for them to twist this around and put it out in Congress or the New York Times.
[03:10:59.841 --> 03:11:03.325]  I mean, I have no Russia connections.
[03:11:03.325 --> 03:11:05.707]  I tweeted as a joke when I was over there as a stunt this year.
[03:11:06.923 --> 03:11:13.308]  That I got a visa to Russia, and then it got so crazy I didn't go, then my ex-wife gets it and tweets around and goes, look, here's his secret passport or whatever.
[03:11:13.308 --> 03:11:16.271]  I tweeted that at Relax Jones as a joke.
[03:11:16.271 --> 03:11:21.475]  So, you know, that's how this hysteria has gotten, and then... Hey, I need to meet with you.
[03:11:21.475 --> 03:11:21.996]  Okay, what's going on?
[03:11:22.336 --> 03:11:24.558]  Well, the Russians have got money for you right now.
[03:11:24.558 --> 03:11:25.459]  We're going to take care of it.
[03:11:25.459 --> 03:11:28.082]  I mean, it's like, it's like, what in earth?
[03:11:28.082 --> 03:11:30.164]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:11:30.164 --> 03:11:31.585]  I'm an American patriot.
[03:11:31.585 --> 03:11:32.886]  Everybody knows it.
[03:11:32.886 --> 03:11:34.048]  And they're trying to shut me down.
[03:11:34.048 --> 03:11:35.469]  They're going after the president.
[03:11:35.469 --> 03:11:39.653]  And I don't see Anthony Cumia, how they get away with it with a 4.6% growth rate.
[03:11:39.653 --> 03:11:42.376]  Can you guys show my original tweet, though?
[03:11:42.376 --> 03:11:45.499]  Just show the original Alex Jones tweet for TV viewers.
[03:11:46.246 --> 03:11:51.371]  I don't know how they get away with this, and even Panetta's saying you better not do it, even Hayden's part of the swamp.
[03:11:51.371 --> 03:11:55.034]  A lot of the swamp, though, isn't thinking what happens when they get rid of Trump.
[03:11:55.034 --> 03:12:00.338]  Or, America's not going to buy them indicting me, saying I'm in bed with the Russians.
[03:12:00.338 --> 03:12:01.339]  It's ridiculous!
[03:12:01.339 --> 03:12:05.343]  I mean, there's no, and they've not found any Russia collusion.
[03:12:05.343 --> 03:12:09.186]  So now it's like processed stuff about taxes 15 years ago.
[03:12:09.186 --> 03:12:09.807]  I mean, Anthony,
[03:12:10.767 --> 03:12:14.669]  This rogue FBI group led by Mueller, it's like he's the President!
[03:12:14.669 --> 03:12:16.110]  It's like he's the Inquisitor!
[03:12:16.110 --> 03:12:18.331]  It's like the Inquisition's back or something!
[03:12:18.331 --> 03:12:25.975]  I mean, and then you got that weird crazy person, Sessions, up there who can't even hardly talk, going, I want you to have 50 years!
[03:12:25.975 --> 03:12:27.676]  If you smoke marriage, you want her!
[03:12:27.676 --> 03:12:29.957]  I mean, this is a frickin' nightmare!
[03:12:29.957 --> 03:12:30.658]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[03:12:30.658 --> 03:12:30.878]  Go ahead.
[03:12:32.387 --> 03:12:36.288]  No, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[03:12:36.288 --> 03:12:41.150]  I honestly think this shows how, we've heard how crazy Donald Trump is.
[03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:42.010]  He's out of control.
[03:12:42.010 --> 03:12:43.151]  The White House is nuts.
[03:12:43.151 --> 03:12:44.471]  It's a madhouse.
[03:12:44.471 --> 03:12:49.793]  And I've never seen a man with more self-control than Donald Trump.
[03:12:49.793 --> 03:12:57.175]  If he was as nuts as they're trying to paint him to be, he would be going after these people as we speak.
[03:12:57.175 --> 03:12:57.676]  Release those documents.
[03:12:57.676 --> 03:13:01.257]  Oh, that's why they put out this fake article with fake sources is to make him trust no one.
[03:13:02.057 --> 03:13:03.558]  Absolutely!
[03:13:03.558 --> 03:13:08.740]  They put out that op-ed piece and called him a mental patient.
[03:13:08.740 --> 03:13:10.761]  They say he's not mentally fit.
[03:13:10.761 --> 03:13:20.466]  Why doesn't he release these documents on the whole Hillary debacle and the Clinton Foundation and this joke of an investigation about Russia?
[03:13:20.826 --> 03:13:26.871]  Why doesn't he fire Sessions and half of the other people that are trying to backstab him in the White House?
[03:13:26.871 --> 03:13:28.773]  This is really happening.
[03:13:28.773 --> 03:13:34.818]  People are trying to remove a democratically elected president.
[03:13:34.818 --> 03:13:38.161]  They are trying to silence you, me.
[03:13:38.161 --> 03:13:44.166]  Oh, by the way, since we last spoke, Alex, I have been kicked off of Twitter and Facebook.
[03:13:44.606 --> 03:13:53.072]  I have no social media platform anymore to go on to even promote my program or voice my opinions.
[03:13:53.072 --> 03:13:54.613]  I have been kicked off!
[03:13:54.613 --> 03:14:06.241]  And that's the thing, they're purging everybody and then they have hearings and say they're not doing it and then Oliver Darcy of CNN that's quarterbacking it, he says no one's been taken off and Trump's crazy!
[03:14:07.338 --> 03:14:12.719]  Well, what about all the people I speak to on a daily basis that are in the same boat that we are?
[03:14:12.719 --> 03:14:17.560]  Getting removed from social media, which these days, it's not a blog.
[03:14:17.560 --> 03:14:20.901]  It's not some little Reddit website.
[03:14:20.901 --> 03:14:27.983]  It's absolutely a hub of communication where world leaders go on and speak about things.
[03:14:27.983 --> 03:14:32.544]  This isn't something that some private... This is like China arresting people who talk in the town square.
[03:14:33.397 --> 03:14:34.438]  Absolutely!
[03:14:34.438 --> 03:14:37.039]  And we talk about it, and I saw you with Rubio!
[03:14:37.039 --> 03:14:41.301]  He's talking about China, and you're saying, it's happening here!
[03:14:41.301 --> 03:14:43.162]  And he's ignoring you!
[03:14:43.162 --> 03:14:45.343]  He knows it!
[03:14:45.343 --> 03:14:49.104]  They love standing there like they don't know what you're talking about!
[03:14:49.104 --> 03:14:50.265]  That isn't happening!
[03:14:50.265 --> 03:14:54.847]  Well, I hope you're lying right now, because if you're not, you're an idiot!
[03:14:54.847 --> 03:15:00.990]  If you don't see what's actually happening out there, they are trying to silence the
[03:15:02.550 --> 03:15:06.052]  Opposition, as it were, which are American patriots.
[03:15:06.052 --> 03:15:10.654]  Gavin McGinnis, he was taken off of Twitter recently.
[03:15:10.654 --> 03:15:14.855]  These are all voices that they do not want out there.
[03:15:14.855 --> 03:15:17.897]  They don't want us influencing people.
[03:15:17.897 --> 03:15:20.198]  And it's all they have going into the election.
[03:15:20.198 --> 03:15:26.740]  I have not heard one platform that they are running on as the Democratic Party.
[03:15:26.740 --> 03:15:30.322]  Their entire platform is based on, we need to silence
[03:15:31.042 --> 03:15:32.543]  Anybody that supports Trump...

[03:16:54.429 --> 03:16:58.352]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.352 --> 03:16:59.892]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:59.892 --> 03:17:02.834]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[03:18:54.045 --> 03:19:04.630]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:06.691]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:19:06.691 --> 03:19:09.553]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:19:09.553 --> 03:19:11.053]  It's made in the USA.
[03:19:11.053 --> 03:19:14.175]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:19:14.415 --> 03:19:17.878]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:19:17.878 --> 03:19:19.939]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:19:19.939 --> 03:19:29.667]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[03:20:07.970 --> 03:20:10.658]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:10.658 --> 03:20:15.793]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:20:19.479 --> 03:20:20.840]  Oh, yes.
[03:20:20.840 --> 03:20:27.622]  A powerful pregnenolone formula for 50% off the Real Red Pill Plus and the Real Red Pill.
[03:20:27.622 --> 03:20:33.364]  With the dangerous toxins that lie within our water, we know we need to filter out that bacteria.
[03:20:33.364 --> 03:20:38.466]  But as you age, filtering out all of those essential minerals as well can make you tired and slow.
[03:20:38.466 --> 03:20:44.968]  That's why our scientists work day and night to create a powerful supplement, the Real Red Pill formula from InfoWars Life.
[03:20:44.968 --> 03:20:47.409]  This proprietary formula.
[03:20:47.409 --> 03:20:48.369]  Screwed up proprietary?
[03:20:48.849 --> 03:20:55.474]  Was created to help you get all the important essential and trace minerals and nutrients your body needs.
[03:20:55.474 --> 03:21:03.981]  As we age, pregnenolone levels decrease with age by as much as 60% between the age of 20 and 75, making you tired and lazy.
[03:21:03.981 --> 03:21:09.265]  With the real red pill formula, you can defy the test of time and keep your pregnenolone up
[03:21:09.765 --> 03:21:14.148]  For hormone balance, healthy aging, and optimal cognitive function daily.

[03:21:35.103 --> 03:21:35.784]  That's right!
[03:21:36.855 --> 03:21:39.357]  Hi everybody, Anthony Comea finally back.
[03:21:39.357 --> 03:21:46.784]  I was on a little vacation, but oh, not on vacation from what's going on in the world.
[03:21:46.784 --> 03:21:57.434]  Great talking to Alex after watching the circus yesterday between the Kavanaugh hearings and then the internet
[03:21:58.248 --> 03:22:01.270]  The social media hearing going on.
[03:22:01.270 --> 03:22:02.832]  It's a joke.
[03:22:02.832 --> 03:22:05.594]  Washington is a joke.
[03:22:05.594 --> 03:22:07.155]  It's a circus.
[03:22:07.155 --> 03:22:11.258]  And to have somebody like Alex get in their face.
[03:22:11.258 --> 03:22:13.720]  Not treat them like everyone else.
[03:22:13.720 --> 03:22:18.364]  Why are these people treated like saints?
[03:22:18.364 --> 03:22:21.166]  And like holy figures.
[03:22:21.166 --> 03:22:25.209]  We're not allowed to get in their face.
[03:22:26.244 --> 03:22:28.846]  And tell them we don't agree with something.
[03:22:28.846 --> 03:22:32.549]  Or point out that they're not representing us.
[03:22:32.549 --> 03:22:34.030]  Which is their job.
[03:22:34.030 --> 03:22:39.014]  Their job is to represent the will of the people of this country.
[03:22:39.014 --> 03:22:40.915]  They don't do that.
[03:22:40.915 --> 03:22:44.638]  And Alex has a set on him, man.
[03:22:44.638 --> 03:22:52.064]  I was watching that yesterday and... Look, I've done some pretty outrageous things during the course of my career.
[03:22:52.819 --> 03:23:00.343]  But I gotta tell ya, to get right up in these people's faces that are, they are the power base!
[03:23:00.343 --> 03:23:02.325]  They're the swamp!
[03:23:02.325 --> 03:23:03.806]  They are these people!
[03:23:03.806 --> 03:23:18.274]  And to have Alex get right in their face, fearless, and just start calling them out for what they are, liars, frauds, hypocrites, to get, he gets right in their face, it's so refreshing to see.
[03:23:18.274 --> 03:23:19.855]  We just don't see that.
[03:23:19.855 --> 03:23:21.436]  That used to be journalism!
[03:23:22.054 --> 03:23:31.322]  That used to be what we enjoyed seeing was the media confronting the power base and telling them we aren't happy.
[03:23:31.322 --> 03:23:35.866]  The people are not happy with the way you're doing your job.
[03:23:35.866 --> 03:23:39.470]  But now the media is part of it!
[03:23:39.470 --> 03:23:46.436]  So who's left to call these people out for not representing the will of the American people?
[03:23:47.651 --> 03:23:49.032]  Very few of them.
[03:23:49.032 --> 03:23:50.874]  One of them, Alex Jones.
[03:23:50.874 --> 03:23:52.655]  So it was, uh, amazing.
[03:23:52.655 --> 03:23:58.299]  When, oh my god, that clip is, uh, is hilarious.
[03:23:58.299 --> 03:24:00.922]  When he said, uh, who is that?
[03:24:00.922 --> 03:24:02.383]  Um, what the hell's his name?
[03:24:02.383 --> 03:24:04.244]  They had it written down here.
[03:24:04.244 --> 03:24:05.785]  Oliver Darcy.
[03:24:05.785 --> 03:24:06.846]  Oliver Darcy.
[03:24:06.846 --> 03:24:10.329]  When he goes, when Alex goes, look at his eyes, just look at his eyes.
[03:24:11.007 --> 03:24:12.187]  Got little rat eyes.
[03:24:12.187 --> 03:24:13.267]  You got rat eyes.
[03:24:13.267 --> 03:24:14.888]  I'm dying.
[03:24:14.888 --> 03:24:19.549]  I'm just... This guy's never been treated like that in his life!
[03:24:19.549 --> 03:24:23.749]  He's surrounded by yes-men at CNN.
[03:24:23.749 --> 03:24:28.390]  I'm sure his family and his friends are all of similar ilk and ideology.
[03:24:28.390 --> 03:24:30.051]  He was shocked!
[03:24:30.051 --> 03:24:30.671]  Look at him!
[03:24:30.671 --> 03:24:32.571]  He doesn't know what to do!
[03:24:32.571 --> 03:24:37.212]  There's a man standing in his face telling him he's a jerk-off.
[03:24:38.064 --> 03:24:41.865]  And it was amazing to watch.
[03:24:41.865 --> 03:24:43.546]  Alex was right on point, too.
[03:24:43.546 --> 03:24:45.966]  Because he went there with a purpose.
[03:24:45.966 --> 03:24:46.806]  There's a reason.
[03:24:46.806 --> 03:24:57.749]  They are shutting down media that is not playing nice with the rest of this cabal, whatever you want to call it.
[03:24:57.749 --> 03:24:59.430]  I don't even know what to call it anymore.
[03:24:59.430 --> 03:25:03.531]  Because it's a triad of Washington,
[03:25:04.686 --> 03:25:12.373]  And the media, the news media, and Hollywood, they have all converged on a mission.
[03:25:12.373 --> 03:25:20.019]  Their prime directive here is to silence and remove the President of the United States.
[03:25:20.019 --> 03:25:28.526]  You know that guy a couple of years ago was legally elected through the democratic election process by the people of this country?
[03:25:29.338 --> 03:25:31.499]  Yeah, yeah, elected president.
[03:25:31.499 --> 03:25:39.744]  And what they are trying to do, this triad, is remove this president.
[03:25:39.744 --> 03:25:53.731]  And if you have a problem with that, and you voice these opinions on their programs, their social media, their servers, you will be silenced.
[03:25:53.731 --> 03:25:54.772]  They will take you off.
[03:25:55.507 --> 03:26:00.389]  of these services so you cannot be heard and give your dissenting opinion.
[03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:17.296]  If you want to scream it to the public and make an appearance somewhere on a college campus or an arena, you will be shouted down by people that have no respect for the First Amendment.
[03:26:17.296 --> 03:26:23.318]  No respect for others' right to give their opinions.
[03:26:24.423 --> 03:26:26.284]  They want you silenced.
[03:26:26.284 --> 03:26:28.084]  That's what they do.
[03:26:28.084 --> 03:26:35.486]  During the Kavanaugh hearing, when it first started, day one of that zoo, you saw it.
[03:26:35.486 --> 03:26:36.547]  Protestors.
[03:26:36.547 --> 03:26:38.627]  Paid protestors, by the way.
[03:26:38.627 --> 03:26:40.088]  Paid protestors.
[03:26:40.088 --> 03:26:53.872]  I saw some amazing clips from outside the venue, outside the Capitol, where it looked like a gentleman was handing money to one of the women that were removed from
[03:26:55.178 --> 03:26:58.701]  Uh, from the, the Capitol.
[03:26:58.701 --> 03:27:01.304]  They, they were, yeah, here it is, look at this.
[03:27:01.304 --> 03:27:09.330]  She's getting money, and she was the one that was just in there getting removed for yelling things out.
[03:27:09.330 --> 03:27:13.854]  Just disrupting the, the process.
[03:27:13.854 --> 03:27:18.498]  Because they don't have any real platform, these people.
[03:27:18.498 --> 03:27:20.540]  They're anarchists.
[03:27:20.540 --> 03:27:21.461]  They're fascists.
[03:27:23.303 --> 03:27:25.524]  Disguised as anti-fascists.
[03:27:25.524 --> 03:27:28.785]  They're Nazis.
[03:27:28.785 --> 03:27:35.809]  They're everything that tries to silence the voice of the American people.
[03:27:35.809 --> 03:27:37.629]  And that's what they're doing.
[03:27:37.629 --> 03:27:42.292]  We'll talk a little more about Kavanaugh later, but he sure seems like a genuine guy.
[03:27:42.292 --> 03:27:45.973]  I mean, especially in this day and age.
[03:27:45.973 --> 03:27:47.354]  My God!
[03:27:47.354 --> 03:27:48.875]  But he, a family guy?
[03:27:49.668 --> 03:27:55.134]  Very community-oriented and serves the public interest.
[03:27:55.134 --> 03:28:03.583]  And, man, they can't do enough to try to keep him from being appointed to the Supreme Court.
[03:28:04.557 --> 03:28:06.458]  I mean, and they have nothing!
[03:28:06.458 --> 03:28:07.859]  It's a show!
[03:28:07.859 --> 03:28:09.740]  And then one trying to top the other.
[03:28:09.740 --> 03:28:11.461]  Cory Booker.
[03:28:11.461 --> 03:28:13.883]  It's like an open mic night in there.
[03:28:13.883 --> 03:28:20.567]  They're all just trying so hard to be the one that comes out of there going, I killed it!
[03:28:20.567 --> 03:28:22.047]  Did you see me?
[03:28:22.047 --> 03:28:24.629]  I called myself Spartacus.
[03:28:24.629 --> 03:28:27.771]  Spartacus!
[03:28:27.771 --> 03:28:29.892]  This guy's a joke!
[03:28:29.892 --> 03:28:31.333]  He's always been a joke!
[03:28:32.806 --> 03:28:36.009]  And now he's, you know, he's the guy.
[03:28:36.009 --> 03:28:39.251]  He's the go-to guy that's gonna shake it up.
[03:28:39.251 --> 03:28:41.033]  It's all about 2020.
[03:28:41.033 --> 03:28:44.456]  It's all about the next presidential election.
[03:28:44.456 --> 03:28:47.379]  They're all posturing to try to get that.
[03:28:47.379 --> 03:28:49.000]  We'll be right back in moments.
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:49.661]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:49.661 --> 03:28:51.403]  Anthony Cumia in at Infowars.com.

[03:33:33.619 --> 03:33:40.005]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:40.005 --> 03:33:42.126]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:33:44.628 --> 03:33:45.928]  Welcome back.
[03:33:45.928 --> 03:33:50.289]  Anthony Comegan here for Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:33:50.289 --> 03:33:53.490]  So much has gone on this past week.
[03:33:53.490 --> 03:33:56.131]  It's frightening when you think about it.
[03:33:56.131 --> 03:34:03.212]  And you could look up older programs here on InfoWars or on my show on CompoundMedia.com.
[03:34:03.212 --> 03:34:14.015]  And you could go back a year, two years, whatever, and hear me say, well, it has absolutely gotten as crazy as it could possibly get.
[03:34:14.774 --> 03:34:19.396]  I can't imagine the country getting any crazier than this.
[03:34:19.396 --> 03:34:20.857]  And then, boom, it gets crazier.
[03:34:20.857 --> 03:34:23.418]  And it's gotten crazier and crazier.
[03:34:23.418 --> 03:34:39.944]  Now I'm at the point where it's so obvious that there is a concerted effort to remove the President of the United States that the people that deny it fall into, I think, three, at least three categories.
[03:34:39.944 --> 03:34:42.305]  They're in on it.
[03:34:42.305 --> 03:34:43.486]  They want this to happen.
[03:34:43.486 --> 03:34:44.166]  They're in on it.
[03:34:44.969 --> 03:34:55.838]  They are zombies fixated to that news bubble of mainstream media and believe the crap that gets kicked out of there.
[03:34:55.838 --> 03:35:01.783]  And the third one, the dumbest people on the face of the earth.
[03:35:02.375 --> 03:35:12.825]  That just have no concept of reality and those are the ones I think you see screaming in the streets and yelling at the Kavanaugh hearings.
[03:35:12.825 --> 03:35:20.853]  Just mindless morons that never look at any other sources for their news.
[03:35:20.853 --> 03:35:22.815]  Trump Derangement Syndrome.
[03:35:22.815 --> 03:35:25.358]  It certainly does appear to be a real thing.
[03:35:25.838 --> 03:35:41.121]  Well, again, any time you might doubt it, all you have to do is flip on the news, and you can reinforce your absolute knowledge in the fact that they are trying to remove a president.
[03:35:41.121 --> 03:35:49.683]  We got the midterm elections coming up in November, and they are in, oh my god, full battle mode, the swamp, to try to undermine
[03:35:50.606 --> 03:36:03.153]  This president tried to put out misinformation, absolutely not talk about any of the great things that are happening here in this country over the past two years of his tenure so far.
[03:36:03.153 --> 03:36:13.439]  And what we're seeing is a trying to chisel away at the man's successes.
[03:36:13.439 --> 03:36:16.020]  We never hear about it.
[03:36:16.020 --> 03:36:17.101]  It's been two years.
[03:36:17.768 --> 03:36:19.629]  We're still here as a country.
[03:36:19.629 --> 03:36:22.749]  There hasn't been this war that they promised.
[03:36:22.749 --> 03:36:27.591]  We're not in economic turmoil like they promised when he was elected.
[03:36:27.591 --> 03:36:29.751]  As a matter of fact, the economy hasn't been better.
[03:36:29.751 --> 03:36:35.953]  And some of the statistics, when you look at unemployment, are better than they have ever been.
[03:36:35.953 --> 03:36:38.874]  And by ever, I mean ever!
[03:36:38.874 --> 03:36:39.554]  Ever been.
[03:36:39.554 --> 03:36:42.435]  But you will never hear about that.
[03:36:42.435 --> 03:36:45.856]  What we need to hear about is that there's a mental patient in the White House.
[03:36:46.944 --> 03:36:51.688]  And we saw this op-ed that came out from the New York Times.
[03:36:51.688 --> 03:36:53.210]  What?
[03:36:53.210 --> 03:36:56.533]  This is, I believe, criminal.
[03:36:56.533 --> 03:36:58.114]  I'm no lawyer.
[03:36:58.114 --> 03:37:02.418]  I know, I know, you might have mistaken me for a lawyer, but I'm no lawyer.
[03:37:02.418 --> 03:37:04.740]  But I gotta say, I can't imagine
[03:37:05.367 --> 03:37:17.856]  That somebody in the White House, although we don't know that for sure, they're really speculating as to who wrote this op-ed, because of course they're anonymous.
[03:37:17.856 --> 03:37:23.740]  But there is speculation who this is and how close to the President they are.
[03:37:23.740 --> 03:37:30.104]  From reading this, they want it to sound like they are extremely close to the President and have influenced
[03:37:31.236 --> 03:38:00.505]  Some of his decision-making through deceptive practices theft and Collusion if I may use that word with other people that work with the president to try to thwart Him succeeding in doing what he promised to do and got elected for promising to do and is doing it so we read this and I just see if I may use the term scumbag written all over this
[03:38:02.365 --> 03:38:12.755]  Whoever wrote this is just a dog and the New York Times for printing it has no ethics.
[03:38:12.755 --> 03:38:19.701]  There's no journalistic integrity when it comes to anonymous slam pieces like this.
[03:38:19.701 --> 03:38:23.345]  You want to talk about trying to influence an election?
[03:38:23.345 --> 03:38:26.748]  There's been an investigation going on for two years now
[03:38:27.509 --> 03:38:40.940]  That is trying to uncover this vast conspiracy of collusion that involved the President and the Russians and God knows who else to collude to influence an election.
[03:38:40.940 --> 03:38:43.802]  What the hell do you think this is?
[03:38:43.802 --> 03:38:47.144]  What do you think the Woodward book coming out now is?
[03:38:47.144 --> 03:38:50.607]  What do you think this op-ed, anonymous op-ed piece is?
[03:38:50.607 --> 03:38:56.552]  They have shown their true colors and their agenda since Trump announced his candidacy.
[03:38:57.794 --> 03:38:59.536]  And this is any different?
[03:38:59.536 --> 03:39:08.063]  It's a coincidence that this comes out 60 days before the midterm elections?
[03:39:08.063 --> 03:39:12.127]  This is trying to influence an election!
[03:39:12.127 --> 03:39:20.795]  When we look at anonymous sources for news stories, we have this amazing recollection of years ago.
[03:39:21.835 --> 03:39:28.580]  We trusted the media with anonymous sources because they had journalistic integrity.
[03:39:28.580 --> 03:39:36.765]  We believed who was speaking to us on the television or who we were reading about in the newspapers.
[03:39:36.765 --> 03:39:47.212]  These were reporters, journalists, people that we trusted to give us the information that we couldn't just go out and get ourselves.
[03:39:48.480 --> 03:39:50.121]  And we believed them.
[03:39:50.121 --> 03:39:54.284]  It's such a nostalgic thought right now.
[03:39:54.284 --> 03:40:07.892]  The only reason we ever trusted anonymous sources when a journalist would tell us, a source told me this and I printed it and I will not reveal who they are to protect them.
[03:40:07.892 --> 03:40:16.717]  And we were like, okay, for some reason that was something that we felt we owed journalists
[03:40:17.583 --> 03:40:25.547]  We owed them, they earned that trust from us to be able to say, look, trust me, this guy said this.
[03:40:25.547 --> 03:40:26.867]  And we did!
[03:40:26.867 --> 03:40:29.068]  We did trust them.
[03:40:29.068 --> 03:40:43.475]  Over the course of the past couple of decades, the degradation of that integrity and the supposed ethics that these journalists had, it's gone now.
[03:40:43.475 --> 03:40:44.075]  It's gone.
[03:40:46.077 --> 03:40:50.539]  It's money without anything to back it.
[03:40:50.539 --> 03:40:52.640]  It used to be, you know, the gold standard.
[03:40:52.640 --> 03:41:02.804]  Their wealth, their gold, their value was their integrity and their ethics, journalistic integrity and ethics.
[03:41:02.804 --> 03:41:13.449]  Now when you hear an anonymous source, like this op-ed piece from the New York Times, why do I owe you my trust?
[03:41:14.272 --> 03:41:32.778]  When all I see is deception and an agenda-driven broadcast on a daily basis of the bashing and attempts to remove a legally elected President of the United States.
[03:41:32.778 --> 03:41:35.939]  So you can't use that anymore.
[03:41:35.939 --> 03:41:44.001]  The news, the mainstream media, cannot use anonymous sources anymore because they've lost
[03:41:44.719 --> 03:41:51.001]  That value that they had backing it, which was the integrity behind it.
[03:41:51.001 --> 03:42:02.384]  So this, I would use this op-ed piece to finish up in the bathroom with, if it was a little more.
[03:42:02.384 --> 03:42:08.286]  Can you print this on some soft double-ply quilted bathroom tissue?
[03:42:08.286 --> 03:42:14.428]  And then I will use it for what the only thing it's good for, which is cleaning up a bit.
[03:42:15.106 --> 03:42:17.569]  After you do your business.
[03:42:17.569 --> 03:42:23.454]  Anything else, just not worth the paper it's printed on.
[03:42:23.454 --> 03:42:36.987]  They've shown that it is an effort, a concerted effort between Hollywood, Washington, and the mainstream media to undermine and overthrow the president.
[03:42:36.987 --> 03:42:38.308]  Does that sound crazy?
[03:42:38.308 --> 03:42:39.129]  Of course it does!
[03:42:39.716 --> 03:42:41.057]  Doesn't mean it's not true.
[03:42:41.057 --> 03:42:44.059]  They've been calling Alex Jones a conspiracy theorist.
[03:42:44.059 --> 03:42:45.100]  Conspiracy?
[03:42:45.100 --> 03:42:47.422]  He's been saying they're gonna throw him off the internet.
[03:42:47.422 --> 03:42:48.742]  They're doing it!
[03:42:48.742 --> 03:42:50.344]  We'll be right back, InfoWars.com.
[03:42:53.083 --> 03:42:54.444]  We knew it was coming.
[03:42:54.444 --> 03:42:55.884]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:42:55.884 --> 03:43:09.150]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:43:09.150 --> 03:43:20.194]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[03:43:20.194 --> 03:43:21.095]  Go to InfoWars.com
[03:43:21.875 --> 03:43:22.296]  I think so.
[03:43:43.499 --> 03:43:46.201]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[03:43:46.201 --> 03:43:51.326]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[03:43:51.326 --> 03:43:53.287]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:43:53.287 --> 03:43:57.991]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWars life.
[03:43:58.812 --> 03:43:59.733]  They take hours.
[03:43:59.733 --> 03:44:02.174]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:44:02.174 --> 03:44:03.335]  It's stronger.
[03:44:03.335 --> 03:44:04.956]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:44:04.956 --> 03:44:08.177]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:44:08.177 --> 03:44:09.298]  It's back in stock.
[03:44:09.298 --> 03:44:12.480]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:44:12.480 --> 03:44:13.621]  It's got the preglanone.
[03:44:13.621 --> 03:44:16.242]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:44:16.242 --> 03:44:19.364]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[03:44:19.364 --> 03:44:20.265]  So you can upload it.
[03:44:20.265 --> 03:44:25.868]  And our latest product that goes great with the Super Blue, Colloidal Silver, and Ionine Fortified Toothpaste.
[03:44:26.468 --> 03:44:29.389]  is super blue silver immune gargle.
[03:44:29.389 --> 03:44:30.330]  That's a spray you do.
[03:44:30.330 --> 03:44:31.630]  You can also swallow it.
[03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:36.972]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more.
[03:44:36.972 --> 03:44:38.373]  Without you, we couldn't do it.

[03:48:31.374 --> 03:48:37.760]  I just want to tell you my show on Compound Media is of course the Anthony Comia Show.
[03:48:37.760 --> 03:48:41.084]  It is available at 4 p.m.
[03:48:41.084 --> 03:48:41.885]  Eastern Time.
[03:48:43.157 --> 03:48:49.221]  And we have a special coupon code for you, the viewers here, the promo code.
[03:48:49.221 --> 03:48:57.366]  If you go to compoundmedia.com and use Alex20, you get 20% off a new subscription to Compound Media.
[03:48:57.366 --> 03:49:01.909]  We need to support each other here because this is a war.
[03:49:01.909 --> 03:49:06.012]  There is censorship going on that is unprecedented.
[03:49:06.542 --> 03:49:14.947]  You would think once we got to the point where we had social media, the entire world can speak to each other.
[03:49:14.947 --> 03:49:16.848]  And what did that get?
[03:49:16.848 --> 03:49:18.409]  More censorship.
[03:49:18.409 --> 03:49:21.131]  People like Alex Jones being shut down.
[03:49:21.131 --> 03:49:22.292]  Myself.
[03:49:22.292 --> 03:49:26.794]  I have lost every single social media account that I had.
[03:49:26.794 --> 03:49:27.935]  Kicked off!
[03:49:27.935 --> 03:49:30.016]  For just speaking my mind!
[03:49:30.016 --> 03:49:31.077]  And they decide to, uh,
[03:49:32.068 --> 03:49:34.111]  To throw you off.
[03:49:34.111 --> 03:49:41.980]  We're going to talk a little bit about that because there were the hearings that we saw and Alex confronting those people.
[03:49:41.980 --> 03:49:44.723]  It was fantastic.
[03:49:44.723 --> 03:49:49.149]  This Jack over there at Twitter.
[03:49:51.393 --> 03:49:57.279]  It's Orwellian, and I hate using that, it's so overused, but it's the only real accurate way to put it.
[03:49:57.279 --> 03:50:06.828]  It's Orwellian, his answers to why certain people get shadowbanned and censored and removed and others do not.
[03:50:06.828 --> 03:50:10.812]  He actually was talking about the fact that he wants Twitter
[03:50:11.795 --> 03:50:17.677]  To foster healthy conversations and not unhealthy conversations.
[03:50:17.677 --> 03:50:28.221]  Doesn't it seem like the best way to run something would be to let the people that are on the service follow other people.
[03:50:28.221 --> 03:50:31.623]  And if they say something, you get to read it.
[03:50:31.623 --> 03:50:35.264]  If you say something, they get to read it.
[03:50:35.264 --> 03:50:37.105]  And we leave it at that.
[03:50:37.105 --> 03:50:39.726]  But no, they have to throw in these algorithms
[03:50:41.036 --> 03:50:53.358]  Which are agenda-driven and created by this guy and his minion over there at Twitter to steer conversations in a certain direction.
[03:50:53.358 --> 03:51:01.780]  To come up with a narrative regardless of who is in the conversation.
[03:51:01.780 --> 03:51:04.500]  They want people to be exposed
[03:51:09.048 --> 03:51:17.653]  To conversations that best fit their agenda, which is obviously a very liberal agenda.
[03:51:17.653 --> 03:51:25.357]  And anytime he's asked, I love this one too, anytime he's asked, so why was this person taken off?
[03:51:25.357 --> 03:51:28.679]  Well, that was a mistake.
[03:51:28.679 --> 03:51:30.079]  We fixed that.
[03:51:30.079 --> 03:51:31.380]  Oh yeah, what about this one?
[03:51:31.380 --> 03:51:32.861]  Well, that was a mistake.
[03:51:33.522 --> 03:51:36.503]  We fixed it, though.
[03:51:36.503 --> 03:51:55.548]  If you have to be in front of Congress to be called out for a mistake for it to actually get fixed, because that's the only way it happens, the average Joe out there doesn't have the ability to have Congress question somebody on their account being taken down.
[03:51:55.548 --> 03:52:00.309]  I've been in entertainment for years, and I certainly don't have that privilege.
[03:52:01.101 --> 03:52:06.523]  To have Congress say, why was Anthony Cumia taken off of Twitter?
[03:52:06.523 --> 03:52:08.084]  Well, it was a mistake.
[03:52:08.084 --> 03:52:12.986]  So all their mistakes that are never addressed are removed from Twitter.
[03:52:12.986 --> 03:52:14.367]  They're gone.
[03:52:14.367 --> 03:52:25.432]  And no longer have a voice on a public forum that is used for world leaders like the President of the United States to discuss policy.
[03:52:25.432 --> 03:52:28.213]  And to discuss intentions.
[03:52:29.108 --> 03:52:33.130]  And other organizations to discuss their agendas.
[03:52:33.130 --> 03:52:40.113]  And certain people now are not allowed to participate in that conversation.
[03:52:40.113 --> 03:52:43.815]  Based on... Exactly!
[03:52:43.815 --> 03:52:44.795]  Based on what?
[03:52:44.795 --> 03:52:46.056]  I have no idea!
[03:52:46.056 --> 03:52:48.557]  There's never a criteria.
[03:52:48.557 --> 03:52:54.460]  It's so... When you get... When you get people like... What the hell was that?
[03:52:54.460 --> 03:52:56.040]  Sarah Jung.
[03:52:56.040 --> 03:52:56.901]  Sarah Jung.
[03:52:58.121 --> 03:53:02.967]  She gets on and, uh, on Twitter and she's able to say whatever she wants.
[03:53:02.967 --> 03:53:04.789]  She's just lambasting white men.
[03:53:05.410 --> 03:53:07.331]  Apparently can't stand them.
[03:53:07.331 --> 03:53:11.753]  So she's saying all that, and getting away with it.
[03:53:11.753 --> 03:53:14.834]  Completely getting away with it, without being banned.
[03:53:14.834 --> 03:53:25.119]  And then other people, who parodied her tweets about white people, by adding Jewish, or black, or any other minority.
[03:53:25.119 --> 03:53:29.581]  Word for word, the rest of the Post was exactly like Sarah's.
[03:53:29.581 --> 03:53:33.523]  But, they just changed the word white to black, or Jewish, or what have you.
[03:53:34.170 --> 03:53:36.391]  They were thrown off.
[03:53:36.391 --> 03:53:42.893]  And again, in front of Congress, Jack goes, yeah, that was a mistake.
[03:53:42.893 --> 03:53:52.636]  What about all the other people that weren't high-profile celebrities or communicators that got thrown off?
[03:53:52.636 --> 03:53:55.637]  Do you think they'll be put back on?
[03:53:55.637 --> 03:53:57.938]  Do you think they'll be verified?
[03:53:57.938 --> 03:53:59.498]  I don't think so.
[03:53:59.498 --> 03:54:00.558]  I don't think so.
[03:54:00.558 --> 03:54:01.999]  It was a mistake, yeah.
[03:54:02.631 --> 03:54:11.098]  Well, the mistake, now I sit there without the ability to engage in lively debate on social media.
[03:54:11.098 --> 03:54:16.562]  Because both Facebook and Twitter have decided I am not worthy to be on their platform.
[03:54:16.562 --> 03:54:18.703]  Meanwhile, I know the truth.
[03:54:18.703 --> 03:54:21.145]  I'm a loose cannon to them.
[03:54:21.145 --> 03:54:22.947]  They don't like things I say.
[03:54:25.316 --> 03:54:27.977]  It's out of control.
[03:54:27.977 --> 03:54:34.981]  Another point on the triangle of Washington and mainstream media is Hollywood.
[03:54:34.981 --> 03:54:41.844]  Hollywood makes up the third point in the trilogy of idiots that we see on a daily basis.
[03:54:41.844 --> 03:54:43.105]  And I love Hollywood.
[03:54:43.105 --> 03:54:44.606]  Oh, do I love it!
[03:54:44.606 --> 03:54:50.568]  They tell us how we're supposed to act, what we're supposed to think and do.
[03:54:50.568 --> 03:54:51.069]  So we got
[03:54:52.444 --> 03:54:54.085]  Asia Argento.
[03:54:54.085 --> 03:54:55.306]  Part of the Me Too movement.
[03:54:55.306 --> 03:54:56.267]  A big part.
[03:54:56.267 --> 03:55:09.315]  She went out on stage and pretty much pointed out the entire audience and said, you knew what was going on in Hollywood with rape and harassment all these years and what did you do?
[03:55:09.315 --> 03:55:17.521]  Well, apparently she was supposed to pay $380 to an underage actor for having sex with him.
[03:55:17.521 --> 03:55:18.681]  Me Too!
[03:55:18.681 --> 03:55:19.302]  There you go.
[03:55:19.302 --> 03:55:21.183]  That's the Me Too movement right there.
[03:55:23.002 --> 03:55:33.564]  Um, well now she's not paying, and her new tat, her new defense, she's now claiming that the underage boy raped her.
[03:55:33.564 --> 03:55:34.804]  Slow clap.
[03:55:34.804 --> 03:55:36.105]  Slow clap!
[03:55:36.105 --> 03:55:38.885]  Because, what a set!
[03:55:38.885 --> 03:55:41.486]  What a set she's sportin'!
[03:55:41.486 --> 03:55:43.326]  That's her defense?
[03:55:43.326 --> 03:55:50.868]  That the underage boy- Could you imagine if the likes of, like, Kevin Spacey came out and said, Hey!
[03:55:50.868 --> 03:55:52.088]  He raped me!
[03:55:53.266 --> 03:55:55.006]  Or Weinstein?
[03:55:55.006 --> 03:55:56.167]  All those actresses?
[03:55:56.167 --> 03:55:58.227]  I was just doing some work!
[03:55:58.227 --> 03:56:01.228]  I was on the phone with Tarantino and she burst in!
[03:56:01.228 --> 03:56:06.029]  And said, I want to see you take a shower!
[03:56:06.029 --> 03:56:07.910]  And pleasure yourself!
[03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:08.610]  No!
[03:56:08.610 --> 03:56:16.492]  But Asia Argento is now saying that she was raped.
[03:56:16.492 --> 03:56:18.792]  She was the one that was raped.
[03:56:18.792 --> 03:56:19.852]  I'm a little distracted.
[03:56:19.852 --> 03:56:21.853]  Out in the studio is the wonderful Ann Coulter.
[03:56:22.561 --> 03:56:29.265]  Ann Coulter is going to be on my program today on compoundmedia.com in mere minutes.
[03:56:29.265 --> 03:56:30.746]  And there's a lot to talk about.
[03:56:30.746 --> 03:56:33.668]  But that's Hollywood.
[03:56:33.668 --> 03:56:38.812]  Another thing, quickly, is I love comedy, stand-up comics.
[03:56:38.812 --> 03:56:41.193]  A lot of my friends are stand-up comics.
[03:56:41.193 --> 03:56:43.975]  And in this day and age, it's almost impossible to get on a stage
[03:56:44.635 --> 03:56:51.360]  In a comedy club, and do cutting-edge, funny, sometimes off-color comedy.
[03:56:51.360 --> 03:56:54.823]  They are called out, and it could be career-ending.
[03:56:54.823 --> 03:57:04.170]  And if anything ten years ago was deemed sexual harassment, like Louis C.K., you could lose your career!
[03:57:04.170 --> 03:57:06.912]  Well, how funny does comedy need to be?
[03:57:06.912 --> 03:57:08.733]  Now there's an actual story here!
[03:57:09.557 --> 03:57:16.431]  That says that there's a certain type of comedy these days that isn't funny.
[03:57:16.431 --> 03:57:19.397]  It's comedy, mind you, but it's based on tragedy.
[03:57:20.166 --> 03:57:23.629]  I want to thank everybody at InfoWars.com for having me on.
[03:57:23.629 --> 03:57:25.470]  Alex Jones, of course.
[03:57:25.470 --> 03:57:25.910]  Wonderful.
[03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:27.771]  I'll see you back here very soon.
[03:57:27.771 --> 03:57:31.474]  In the meantime, you can watch me on CompoundMedia.com.

[03:57:49.487 --> 03:57:52.709]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[03:57:52.709 --> 03:57:56.412]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:57:56.412 --> 03:58:01.115]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:58:01.115 --> 03:58:04.377]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:58:05.257 --> 03:58:16.264]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[03:58:16.264 --> 03:58:24.790]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.

[03:59:03.456 --> 03:59:04.237]  The revolution.
