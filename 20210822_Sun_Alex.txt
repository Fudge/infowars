[00:00.000 --> 00:22.240]  Are the petty tyrants who have recklessly mandated vaccines while refusing non-vaccinated
[00:22.240 --> 00:28.120]  people food, employment and basic freedom of choice violating the internationally recognized
[00:28.120 --> 00:33.120]  Nuremberg Code which is punishable by death? Yes. Yes they are.
[00:33.120 --> 00:40.120]  I will not bow. I will not surrender to this tyrant over this issue. I am not asleep. I
[00:40.120 --> 00:47.120]  am a free America. I have the Nuremberg Code and the Constitution behind me.
[00:47.120 --> 00:53.840]  In fact, they are violating the set of research ethics principles for human experimentation
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.680]  created by the USA vs. Brant Court as one result of the Nuremberg trials at the end
[00:59.680 --> 01:05.600]  of the Second World War with abandon. Dr. Fauci, as you are aware, it is a crime
[01:05.600 --> 01:12.560]  to lie to Congress. Section 1001 of the U.S. Criminal Code creates a felony and a five-year
[01:12.560 --> 01:18.080]  penalty for lying to Congress. You stated that the NIH has not ever and does not now
[01:18.080 --> 01:24.600]  fund gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and yet gain of function
[01:24.600 --> 01:31.560]  research was done entirely in the Wuhan Institute by Dr. Sheen and was funded by the NIH.
[01:31.560 --> 01:37.140]  Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress. Now they want you to show a vaccine
[01:37.140 --> 01:41.880]  card and if you are caught with someone eating at your restaurant without a vaccine card
[01:41.880 --> 01:49.160]  $1,000. Two times $2,000. How do you feel about that? I feel that my liberties have
[01:49.160 --> 01:57.280]  been taken away from me. Nurses from Dignity Health took to the streets Friday to protest
[01:57.280 --> 02:02.120]  the California COVID-19 vaccine mandate. The mandate announced August 5th requires
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.000]  all health care workers in California to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by September
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.760]  30th. Otherwise they will lose their jobs. Any establishment that serves food or drinks
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.760]  like restaurants, bars and clubs, theaters, as well as entertainment venues will require
[02:16.760 --> 02:22.000]  that vaccination and gyms like this one as well as dance studios also included those
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.960]  large events at those indoor venues. The beginning of the Nuremberg Code reads, the
[02:27.960 --> 02:34.160]  voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the
[02:34.160 --> 02:40.520]  person involved should have legal capacity to give consent, should be so situated as
[02:40.520 --> 02:47.040]  to be able to exercise free power of choice without the intervention of any element of
[02:47.040 --> 02:55.080]  force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.600]  and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject
[02:59.600 --> 03:05.440]  matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. An
[03:05.440 --> 03:11.360]  experiment is defined as a test, trial or tentative procedure, an act or operation for
[03:11.360 --> 03:19.400]  the purpose of discovering something unknown. So far, 237 candidate vaccines against SARS-CoV-2
[03:19.400 --> 03:25.640]  are in development worldwide of which 63 have been approved for clinical trials and 27 are
[03:25.640 --> 03:31.920]  evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials. Six candidate vaccines have been authorized for
[03:31.920 --> 03:39.320]  emergency use based on their efficacy data in phase 3 trials. The FDA's emergency authorization
[03:39.320 --> 03:45.640]  of the ineffective vaccine describes emergency approval as a mechanism to facilitate the
[03:45.640 --> 03:52.320]  availability and use of medical countermeasures including vaccines during public health emergencies
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.560]  such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent
[03:57.560 --> 04:03.120]  serious or life-threatening diseases when certain statutory criteria have been met including
[04:03.120 --> 04:09.160]  that there are no adequate approved and available alternatives. There are myriad of early treatment
[04:09.160 --> 04:14.400]  alternatives that could have already saved thousands of lives had the doctors promoting
[04:14.400 --> 04:21.000]  them not been censored by Silicon Valley which allowed politicians to pretend they were licensed
[04:21.000 --> 04:45.760]  in the Hippocratic oath.
[04:45.760 --> 04:48.960]  Alright, there's the full video. It's about two more minutes left. It's very important.
[04:48.960 --> 04:53.080]  It's live-saving. It just went live minutes ago at Bandot Video. It's Nuremberg Code
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.160]  Honorable By Death. Get it out if you want to save lives. Bandot Video, John Bounds
[04:57.160 --> 05:01.040]  section, stay with us.
[05:01.040 --> 05:06.280]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had
[05:06.280 --> 05:11.080]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding onto a jaw and I heard Dr.
[05:11.080 --> 05:14.920]  Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival
[05:14.920 --> 05:19.000]  shield, the X1. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.520]  that stew with a deep burn source and I got really excited about that so I took it. And
[05:23.520 --> 05:29.960]  then in two weeks I went from brain fog to literally like my brain was enlightened. I
[05:29.960 --> 05:35.040]  could think again. I could connect with people again. And over the course of the next couple
[05:35.040 --> 05:39.560]  of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're
[05:39.560 --> 05:44.080]  all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout. It literally
[05:44.080 --> 05:47.960]  like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway, so the point
[05:47.960 --> 05:52.160]  is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system and
[05:52.160 --> 05:55.720]  the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[05:55.720 --> 06:17.360]  And beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[06:17.360 --> 06:39.200]  Well, my friends, we are extremely honored to be here live on this Sunday, August 22
[06:39.200 --> 06:46.360]  Worldwide Transmission. Who knows how long we will be here. Globalist imperial troops
[06:46.360 --> 06:50.480]  could enter the base at any time the way the world's working right now. Wow, who would
[06:50.480 --> 06:56.120]  think you'd tune into Tucker Carlson on Friday night and hear about Owen Schreuer with an
[06:56.120 --> 07:02.480]  arrest warrant issued for him for quote assaulting and attacking and breaking into the capital.
[07:02.480 --> 07:07.280]  They actually say he broke into the capital. He never went in the capital and you just
[07:07.280 --> 07:15.160]  see the level of lying and it hurts to see the left then oh, celebrating and hundreds
[07:15.160 --> 07:22.160]  of newspapers, hundreds and CNN celebrating and oh, he's Alex's next. Now Owen will sing
[07:22.160 --> 07:29.440]  like a canary on Jones. Seeing like a canary. This is absolutely ridiculous. Bad comedy.
[07:29.440 --> 07:35.760]  Owen will be in studio second hour. He's hosting, of course, the next show we do on Sundays
[07:35.760 --> 07:41.360]  for the last year or so. It's very popular. That Sunday live six to eight PM with Owen
[07:41.360 --> 07:47.880]  Schreuer. But Owen won't be able to be hosting tomorrow because he's reporting to jail. That's
[07:47.880 --> 07:52.320]  right and we're not asking for folks to go down to the federal courthouse. We're not
[07:52.320 --> 07:55.680]  trying to have a demonstration or anything at this point. I'll deliver him down there
[07:55.680 --> 08:01.280]  tomorrow in the morning. And then that's that's that's that deliver him into the jaws of this
[08:01.280 --> 08:06.720]  thing. When you read the federal, it's not an indictment. It's just a federal arrest warrant.
[08:06.720 --> 08:11.560]  You read it for yourself. It's linked in all the news articles. It really blows your mind
[08:11.560 --> 08:16.640]  because they have images saying here's the evidence he physically broke through the barriers
[08:16.640 --> 08:22.520]  and went in the Capitol and it shows an image of me and him on top of stack of chairs on
[08:22.520 --> 08:31.080]  the grassy lawn up from the Capitol 300 yards or so saying don't go into the Capitol. And
[08:31.080 --> 08:38.040]  then that turns into Oh, I'd encourage people to break in an attack and you're reading this
[08:38.040 --> 08:46.800]  and there's video of all of it not happening. You know, we had bodycams and we had 10 security
[08:46.800 --> 08:53.320]  guys with 10 bodycams. And oh, we also have a body cam. We went and reviewed it again yesterday.
[08:53.320 --> 08:56.520]  I never put all of it out because there's so many versions of it and different ones.
[08:56.520 --> 09:00.320]  I think we've uploaded to band on video at least one or two versions. But when you've
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.520]  got 10 bodycams, we didn't upload all 10. We spent hours or stay reviewing it. We have
[09:05.520 --> 09:10.800]  Owen on video and myself on video talking to the police saying, let us get on your
[09:10.800 --> 09:15.520]  speaker PA system and tell people get out of the building. We know you have a PA system
[09:15.520 --> 09:19.880]  which they activated that night, by the way. You tell people get out of the building. You
[09:19.880 --> 09:23.480]  have it for fires, emergencies. Why aren't you using it? It's a stand down. And then
[09:23.480 --> 09:27.000]  we said, where can we help? And they said over on that side, that's where they breached
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.200]  again. If you want to go try to stop them go there. And I asked the police. I said, can
[09:30.200 --> 09:33.760]  I permission to go up, try to take them down off the steps? They say, yes, use your voice
[09:33.760 --> 09:42.760]  to try to stop this. We have it on video. We posted more of it yesterday to infowars.com.
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.080]  We have it for angle after angle. And then they still are trying to put him in jail
[09:48.080 --> 09:53.040]  for years saying he assaulted and broke through into the Capitol. They don't just say he was
[09:53.040 --> 10:00.320]  in unauthorized areas. They also say he broke in. By the way, because he was on misdemeanor
[10:00.320 --> 10:04.880]  probation for getting arrested twice, once silently protesting, once saying something
[10:04.880 --> 10:12.440]  to Nadler during the first impeachment of Trump. Owen would not get on the bullhorn
[10:12.440 --> 10:15.280]  once we got to the Capitol. I'm like, hey, help me get people out of the building. He
[10:15.280 --> 10:19.120]  was like, hey, I'm not talking on the bullhorn. I can't be here. I can't protest. And by that
[10:19.120 --> 10:23.000]  he said, I can be here. I just can't be protesting. That's the rule. Don't protest at the Capitol.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.360]  Don't not come to the Capitol. But he didn't go in the Capitol either. That's another reason
[10:27.360 --> 10:31.400]  they say they're charging him and trying to charge him with all this other garbage. So
[10:31.400 --> 10:37.480]  it's just crazy. But I've got such huge news before he joins us. But it's bigger than just
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.920]  Owen, obviously. We all know this is really about it. It's about Nancy Pelosi and it's
[10:42.920 --> 10:48.720]  about Maxine Waters saying go attack people. Go after folks. Whoever said protesters are
[10:48.720 --> 10:54.560]  peaceful, Andrew Cuomo, all these people calling for violence. I mean, burning down federal
[10:54.560 --> 10:59.720]  courthouses, burning down churches, attacking people, all of them basically had their charges
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.760]  dropped against them. I mean, Andy was out stalking shooting people and the media on
[11:03.760 --> 11:09.280]  CNN is defending them. And then Owen has not ever touched anybody, has no criminal record
[11:09.280 --> 11:13.480]  previous to that, and they are trying to put him under the jail and had it all over the
[11:13.480 --> 11:17.320]  news. In fact, we are not litigious because we're under such attack. We're not trying
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.720]  to get offensive lawsuits, but some of the publications need to be sued. We're looking
[11:21.720 --> 11:28.960]  at it right now. Like, oh, there's a bunch of them. But the worst is the Huffington Post
[11:28.960 --> 11:34.440]  are like, Owen, who's praised the attack on the Capitol, says it needs to happen more.
[11:34.440 --> 11:39.880]  Owen, who led the attack. Remember the Wall Street Journal said Jones from a distance out
[11:39.880 --> 11:45.760]  of range of police tear gas and rubber bullets commanded everyone to attack and destroy the
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.880]  Capitol. And they had seen the video of me saying, don't go in, stop from the moment
[11:50.880 --> 11:56.320]  I got there, but they don't care because these are evil liars, ladies and gentlemen. They're
[11:56.320 --> 11:59.520]  backed by Soros and all that money, and they think they can do whatever they want, however
[11:59.520 --> 12:03.040]  they want, whenever they want. It's incredible. But let me tell you the really big news. That's
[12:03.040 --> 12:08.920]  coming up second hour though. And I'm going to do a good job here today because it needs
[12:08.920 --> 12:13.080]  to be covered getting into the COVID-19 globalist power grab news and what's really happening
[12:13.080 --> 12:16.280]  with the Delta variant. We've cracked the code on the situation. We know what's really
[12:16.280 --> 12:20.920]  going on. We're going to lay it all out today. We have a bunch of countries coming in. And
[12:20.920 --> 12:24.680]  guys, I think I sent it to you, but I don't see it in the stack. Maybe I missed it, but
[12:24.680 --> 12:28.720]  recheck the hundreds of things I sent you. You're doing a great job. I sent you guys
[12:28.720 --> 12:35.960]  a graph on Hawaii showing how they're the most vaccinated in the U.S. and have the highest
[12:35.960 --> 12:40.960]  level of COVID and COVID illnesses. And the majority of folks hospitalized have been inoculated
[12:40.960 --> 12:44.800]  because I want to show that graph. But I've got graphs from around the world, official
[12:44.800 --> 12:50.480]  U.N. graphs showing the least of countries vaccinated, the lower level of illness and
[12:50.480 --> 12:55.520]  sickness they have. We've got that incredible news. And a big federal government study just
[12:55.520 --> 13:01.280]  came out and confirmed that, of course, what the system doesn't want you to know about
[13:01.280 --> 13:07.920]  nano silver and what it does. So are we reading from that federal document as well? That is
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.600]  all coming up here on the transmission today. Since we talked about it, there's a bunch
[13:13.600 --> 13:17.440]  other news, too. Apple says they're going to read everything on your phone and scan
[13:17.440 --> 13:20.480]  all your photos. They've always been doing it, but now they know they're about to be
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.560]  caught. So now they're saying, oh, it's for child porn when they run giant death camps
[13:24.560 --> 13:29.840]  and help China actually run its death camps. And even liberals are saying, this is wrong.
[13:29.840 --> 13:34.080]  Don't read my messages. I mean, they actually have fat checkers in your phone looking at
[13:34.080 --> 13:38.720]  your photos. I always told you that now it's come out. So they're really in damage control
[13:38.720 --> 13:44.400]  right now. But I've got stacks of news where the CIA and the left are running giant pedophile
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.200]  rings and big techs protecting that news. So they claim they're going to stop pedophilia.
[13:49.200 --> 13:53.040]  I mean, there was one tech company I think is the most evil is probably Apple. I mean,
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.800]  that is just they run the worst death camps, worst factories in the world, suicide nets
[13:56.800 --> 14:00.240]  around their facilities. I mean, it's just the idea that we're going to, we're going
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.200]  to spy on everything you do in lifetime to keep you safe from pedophiles. Yeah, right.
[14:05.200 --> 14:07.520]  Sure. But here's Tucker Carlson,
[14:09.040 --> 14:12.320]  Friday night talking about soon to be political president, Owen Schreuer.
[14:13.520 --> 14:17.600]  None of this means the DOJ is going to stop prosecuting political dissidents. However,
[14:17.600 --> 14:21.840]  they're full speed ahead on that. Just today, the DOJ, the Biden administration,
[14:21.840 --> 14:28.320]  announced is charging a host at Info Wars, a man called Owen Schreuer, with several federal
[14:28.320 --> 14:33.280]  crimes, including quote, entering a restricted area on January 6th. Well, that sounds bad.
[14:33.280 --> 14:37.440]  What did Owen Schreuer do? He didn't go inside the Capitol building in January 6th. He stood
[14:37.440 --> 14:43.360]  on the Capitol steps with hundreds of other people. He didn't even loot Macy's like Black
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.640]  Lives Matter. He just stood there on the Capitol steps, a building he thought he owned as an
[14:48.640 --> 14:53.840]  American citizen. What's going on here exactly? Well, Owen Schreuer's real crime appeared to
[14:53.840 --> 14:59.600]  have occurred in December of 2019 when he shouted mean things to Jerry Nadler during a congressional
[14:59.600 --> 15:05.200]  hearing. The DOJ accused him of disorderly conduct and told him, never go near the Capitol again.
[15:05.200 --> 15:12.400]  You don't want to hurt Jerry Nadler's feelings. He disobeyed. Now he's going to jail on Monday.
[15:12.400 --> 15:15.840]  Are you cool with this Dick Cheney's daughter? Is that all right with you? Is this the country
[15:15.840 --> 15:21.520]  you want to live in? How about that Adam Kinzinger? Is this the democracy you fought for? Please.
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.800]  So the ring leaders of the riots go free, especially if they're working for the FBI,
[15:26.800 --> 15:31.840]  but the people who offend Joe Biden's friends, they're in jail. And by the way,
[15:32.480 --> 15:36.880]  all of Tucker Carlson Friday was incredible. I watched it yesterday. He did the best job yet
[15:36.880 --> 15:42.240]  exposing how criminal elements of the FBI ran the real attack on the Capitol on January 6th.
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.080]  So we're going to cover that in the second hour as well. Please stay with us. Oh, and
[15:46.080 --> 15:53.120]  there's a lot more. Sorry. I forgot to tell you. I hadn't read some of the writings of
[15:53.120 --> 15:57.040]  Klaus Schwab in a while. So I decided to refresh my memory. Wait till I read this. He admits to
[15:57.040 --> 16:04.560]  all his crimes. I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021. And I just want to say
[16:04.560 --> 16:09.120]  something. I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.840]  over the years. It is truly an answer to prayer. And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you,
[16:13.840 --> 16:18.000]  the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you. Whether you
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.480]  are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter. You got red blood. And if you
[16:22.480 --> 16:27.680]  love freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters
[16:27.680 --> 16:32.560]  together. And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[16:32.560 --> 16:37.680]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future. But again, that's really
[16:37.680 --> 16:43.360]  up to you and up to God. So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.280]  heart to support us. But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God. I just want to
[16:47.280 --> 16:52.000]  thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done. And just ask you
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.640]  again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you. And hopefully, God will touch your
[16:56.640 --> 17:02.560]  heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless. Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s.
[17:03.120 --> 17:07.840]  And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020, where a world government's
[17:07.840 --> 17:12.960]  being established, where members of Congress and former presidents are censured by Big Tech and
[17:12.960 --> 17:19.200]  where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood plots and prions all over your
[17:19.200 --> 17:25.920]  body, then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane. Think about that, because that's where we are.
[17:25.920 --> 17:31.520]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell just five years ago, if somebody told you this would be
[17:31.520 --> 17:37.120]  happening. But it is happening now. And then they tell you, oh, sorry, it's not a vaccine, it's a
[17:37.120 --> 17:41.760]  gene therapy, and it doesn't really work. So you got to take it every few months. And the people
[17:41.760 --> 17:46.560]  that have submitted say, great, I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not get sick
[17:46.560 --> 17:51.040]  from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID. And now there's record numbers of really sick
[17:51.040 --> 17:56.560]  people from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus. And that's in mainline studies. Bill Gates
[17:56.560 --> 18:03.920]  and Fauci did this, need to go to prison for it right now. The first time I heard the speech,
[18:03.920 --> 18:09.920]  the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt, I was in sixth grade. And we have this
[18:09.920 --> 18:15.520]  history teacher that had us write a paper on the man in the arena. And I just remember thinking
[18:15.520 --> 18:19.600]  about that and saying, I want to be the man in the arena. But when it comes to media,
[18:19.600 --> 18:25.440]  M4Words has been the tip of that spear. But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good a job
[18:25.440 --> 18:30.560]  as we've done, maybe even better when it comes to election fraud and other issues. And that's why
[18:30.560 --> 18:37.760]  if you go to mypillow.com, use promo code Alex, you get up to 66% off on all the amazing products.
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.560]  He's not so many, not just pillows, not just towels, not the sheets. And then you fund M4Words
[18:42.560 --> 18:46.640]  and Mike Lindell in the fight for free speech against the globalist. There's not a better
[18:46.640 --> 18:51.520]  place to spend your money than mypillow.com with promo code Alex. And if you do it, it funds the
[18:51.520 --> 18:56.320]  M4Word, it funds the election investigation, and it stands up against these globalist bullies.
[18:56.320 --> 19:02.720]  Mypillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now. Ladies and gentlemen, fighting legal battles is
[19:02.720 --> 19:09.840]  not fun and it's not cheap. Trust me, we know all about that here at Infowars. And now unfortunately,
[19:09.840 --> 19:16.080]  I have become a big political target of the New World Order and of the Democrat Party and of the
[19:16.080 --> 19:21.600]  mainstream media. Now, I'm just one in a group of many that they are targeting, but boy, oh boy,
[19:21.600 --> 19:27.200]  they coming after me now. And so I need your financial assistance at defend Owen.com. I'm
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.920]  gonna have to have lawyers working on this case all the time. Unfortunately, it's not gonna be
[19:31.920 --> 19:36.000]  cheap, it's not gonna be fun, but you can ease some of the stress, ease some of the financial
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.280]  burden by going to defend Owen.com if you're able to financially support. Of course, your words
[19:41.280 --> 19:46.720]  to support mean everything, your prayers are paramount, but defend Owen.com for financial
[19:46.720 --> 19:53.040]  support so that I can be sure that I have the best legal team for this defense, which is gonna be key
[19:53.040 --> 20:02.320]  for free speech and for the truth and to keep me on air. Thank you for going to defend Owen.com.
[20:03.120 --> 20:08.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:18.320 --> 20:21.840]  There's a big spin machine going on right now across the country.
[20:21.840 --> 20:25.280]  A talk show host, Mr. Valentine up in Tennessee, I've been a guest on the show
[20:25.280 --> 20:30.880]  over the years a few times, was against the lockdowns against all the mandates like I am,
[20:30.880 --> 20:41.840]  and he just died of COVID-19 Delta variant. And people are out and saying, well, look, he died.
[20:41.840 --> 20:46.000]  Now, everybody has to take vaccines. I'm gonna explain something very slowly and very clearly.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.120]  These so-called vaccines are gene therapies. They are not vaccines. They are experimental shots,
[20:51.120 --> 20:56.240]  unauthorized, violating the Nuremberg code. And I have stacks of mainline literature and actual
[20:56.240 --> 21:04.400]  studies and literally hundreds of clips of top doctors explaining that it would not work
[21:05.120 --> 21:09.600]  when they came out with these injections for the coronavirus. And then it would cause a bunch of
[21:09.600 --> 21:15.120]  deadly variants, which it's now done. You can pull up the NIH's own computer models and
[21:15.120 --> 21:21.360]  it shows when the inoculation starts eight months ago, all these variants start. That's a fact,
[21:21.360 --> 21:29.360]  because these are live vaccines. One is synthetic mRNA. The others are viral vector vaccines,
[21:29.360 --> 21:34.400]  very fricking dangerous, just like the old Gardasil shot from 15 years ago that killed
[21:34.400 --> 21:39.760]  so many people and sterilized so many people. So it's not a game. What does a live virus mean?
[21:39.760 --> 21:46.640]  It replicates and then it spreads. And so I've personally talked to more than 10 medical doctors
[21:46.640 --> 21:51.680]  just the last few days that run major hospitals, you name it. They've all concurred that 100%
[21:52.320 --> 21:55.680]  it is the so-called inoculation that's spreading. And yeah, the crew pulls it up.
[21:55.680 --> 22:00.880]  There's the Associated Press last year. UN says New Polio outbreak in Sudan caused my oral vaccine
[22:00.880 --> 22:06.960]  because it is a live vaccine. And Gates has been caught in over 30 countries doing it.
[22:06.960 --> 22:12.880]  It was made illegal back in the 70s. He still does it. Why? Why do you think?
[22:13.760 --> 22:17.760]  Now, let's look right here. This is right out of the federal government's own numbers.
[22:19.280 --> 22:27.360]  Daily report trends. Romanian. How do we explain the situation in Romania? 25% of the population
[22:27.360 --> 22:32.560]  vaccinated cases and deaths plummeting to basically zero or the lowest in the world.
[22:32.560 --> 22:40.960]  Same thing in Australia. They got 20% taking the vaccine. No one is in the hospital now that
[22:41.760 --> 22:46.240]  is unvaccinated. That's even on the Australian news. But they say that we're not going to allow
[22:46.240 --> 22:50.320]  one person to ever get sick. Now, what's happening in the most vaccinated state
[22:51.520 --> 23:00.000]  in the United States? Current hospitalizations, Hawaii. You can see the mask mandate and the
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.040]  inoculations all starting right here. And what happens right when they start the shots?
[23:06.960 --> 23:11.360]  Hospitalization spike. But it takes a lot of the mutations to grow and to get out into the
[23:11.360 --> 23:18.800]  population and then suddenly look at that spike. Now, this numbers were not out from the CDC
[23:18.800 --> 23:23.280]  and the NIH until two days ago. What did you hear me say the last two months, three months here on
[23:23.280 --> 23:30.000]  there? I went from saying there's almost no one sick. The hospitals are totally empty. COVID is a
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.040]  real virus but it's manufactured. It's very hard to get. They're saying other people dying of other
[23:35.040 --> 23:40.400]  things are dying of COVID to get all that extra money and to create fear for the vaccines. What
[23:40.400 --> 23:44.560]  I started saying two months ago, three months ago, I said there are a lot of real cases now.
[23:44.560 --> 23:49.920]  There are a lot of really sick people now. The Delta variant is a thousand times more viral.
[23:49.920 --> 23:53.360]  That's what they say it is. And I've talked to scientists that have actually looked at it. So
[23:53.360 --> 24:00.000]  what's happening is it's not as deadly as the original COVID but it's a mutation. Obviously,
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.440]  out of the people that have been vaccinated, they've become the super shatters and spreaders.
[24:03.440 --> 24:10.960]  That's what the studies say. And so it is absolutely communicable and super easy to get. And the most
[24:10.960 --> 24:15.520]  communicable thing I've ever heard of. I mean, I know for a fact, if you're in the room with somebody
[24:15.520 --> 24:20.400]  that has the Delta variant, you're going to get it. I mean, almost everybody I know in Austin
[24:20.400 --> 24:23.600]  literally has been sick with this crap. I started telling you two and a half months ago,
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.400]  people are calling in going, well Alex, you were first saying it's a hoax and it's a BS and
[24:28.400 --> 24:33.200]  now you're saying it's real. I just tell you what's going on. And we predicted it. The science
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.360]  predicted it. All the experts predicted it. You give hundreds of millions of people billions
[24:37.360 --> 24:43.040]  worldwide an experimental live virus vaccine. What's it going to do? Whether you're in Pakistan
[24:43.040 --> 24:47.680]  or whether you're in India or whether you're in Nigeria or wherever they've done this all over
[24:47.680 --> 24:55.200]  the world. The vast majority, in fact, almost all polio cases are from the inoculation because
[24:55.200 --> 25:00.960]  it's a live polio vaccine. This is the same thing. This is a medical. I think there's articles
[25:00.960 --> 25:04.720]  before the inoculations even started or right when they did vaccines could drive the evolution of
[25:04.720 --> 25:13.440]  work around 19 mutants. Yeah. And I've got clip after clip of Nobel Prize winners and former heads
[25:13.440 --> 25:18.960]  of Pfizer and the top people. Did you know the CEO of Pfizer just said he's not taking it?
[25:21.920 --> 25:28.320]  I'll play that clip in a moment. So all I do is immerse myself in this. I'm not the expert. I
[25:28.320 --> 25:33.520]  read the reports and what's going on and we predicted all this and it's come true. So Hawaii
[25:33.520 --> 25:39.200]  is off the chart. If you're a radio listener, we'll archive this later in M4s. You got to go
[25:39.200 --> 25:44.400]  look at it. Hospitalizations in Hawaii are up 854% in two months despite one of the longest mass
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.720]  mandates and highest vaccination rates in the country. But the good news is that experts and
[25:48.720 --> 25:54.640]  the media are squarely focused on ignoring this and forcing another mask mandate on two-year-olds.
[25:56.240 --> 26:02.960]  That's sarcasm folks. And then meanwhile in places where they're not inoculating with the poison,
[26:02.960 --> 26:10.880]  they basically have no cases. Look at this out of Romania, which is in right in the middle of
[26:10.880 --> 26:15.760]  Europe. All people coming through it from all the world, not an island. Then look at this.
[26:17.040 --> 26:25.680]  Almost zero new cases, zero in the hospitals. Unbelievable. And that's the same everywhere.
[26:25.680 --> 26:30.000]  Israel is the most inoculated in the world of any large nation. Highest cover rate,
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.560]  highest death rate, highest mutation rate. Gibraltar, highest rate period in the world.
[26:36.560 --> 26:44.240]  Seychelles, over 90%, highest high, high rate. I don't want to cut these clips short.
[26:46.160 --> 26:49.760]  Got a bunch of medical doctors I want to play for you on this when we come back. But first,
[26:49.760 --> 26:56.400]  let's take President Trump, who I believe is a good person and who I really care about and who
[26:56.400 --> 26:59.600]  I want to see get a lot of good Republicans elected in the midterms and who I would love to
[26:59.600 --> 27:05.040]  see run again. We got to take him to the woodshed, though, because he came out last week on Fox and
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.280]  Friends and said, I really am suspicious of this booster shot. If this supposedly works so well,
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.560]  why do you need a booster shot? Because you got lied to, Trump. It didn't have 98% efficacy. We knew
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.600]  day one, it wouldn't work, period. It's a fraud. It'll create mutants. You got chumped. You got signed
[27:19.600 --> 27:24.320]  on to a fraud to restart the economy. I understand why you did it. You believe in science. These
[27:24.320 --> 27:28.800]  are bad actors, sir. You believed America could produce a good vaccine. Of course they could have.
[27:28.800 --> 27:32.400]  They didn't want to. They didn't create a vaccine. They created a Frankenstein.
[27:33.920 --> 27:38.640]  And now they've got you signed up to it. Now the left thing, you better get out there and push it,
[27:38.640 --> 27:43.360]  and you are. CNN comes out and says, we need to see Trump come out and take the shots. And within
[27:43.360 --> 27:49.520]  weeks of them saying it over and over again, CNN snaps their fingers. Jeff Zucker snaps his fingers
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.480]  and Trump clicks his heels and hops up there in attention. It says, how do you want me to jump,
[27:54.480 --> 28:01.200]  boss? There's Trump in Alabama yesterday. I believe totally in your freedoms. I do. You've
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.800]  got to do what you have to do. But I recommend take the vaccines. I did it. It's good. Take the
[28:06.800 --> 28:14.080]  vaccines. But you got, no, that's okay. That's all right. You got your freedoms. But I happen
[28:14.080 --> 28:20.800]  to take the vaccine. If it doesn't work, you'll be the first to know. Okay. I'll call up Alabama.
[28:20.800 --> 28:27.680]  I'll say, Hey, you know what? But it is working BS Trump. That's a lie. You're not stupid.
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.320]  Just two weeks ago, they said it was 65% then 40% saw a number put up on about Pfizer shots,
[28:34.320 --> 28:38.160]  30 some percent. Because he's going to say it doesn't work. So you're running at the new damn
[28:38.160 --> 28:41.440]  shot. And then they'll tell you in six months, that one doesn't work. It's called rope adult.
[28:42.480 --> 28:48.160]  Shame on you, Trump. Seriously. Hey, if you don't have the good sense to save yourself your political
[28:48.160 --> 28:51.680]  career, that's okay. At least you're going to get some good Republicans elected. And you know,
[28:51.680 --> 28:56.880]  we like you. But my God, maybe you're not that bright. Maybe Trump's actually a dumbass. All
[28:56.880 --> 29:02.160]  right, we'll be right back. Stay with us. So when I first started taking survival skills,
[29:02.160 --> 29:07.680]  basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely
[29:07.680 --> 29:12.400]  holding onto a job. And I heard Dr. Group on this show and I listened to it. So the first one I got
[29:12.400 --> 29:16.800]  was the original survival shield, the X one. And it worked pretty good. And then shortly
[29:16.800 --> 29:20.160]  thereafter, you came out with that studio, you know, with the deep burdens towards, you know,
[29:20.160 --> 29:25.200]  and I got really excited about that. So I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog
[29:25.200 --> 29:30.720]  to like literally like my brain was enlightened. You know, I could think again, I could connect
[29:30.720 --> 29:35.680]  with people again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I
[29:35.680 --> 29:40.480]  religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The
[29:40.480 --> 29:45.200]  one I like recently is knockout. It literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing.
[29:45.200 --> 29:49.680]  It works. But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free
[29:49.680 --> 29:54.560]  of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand.
[29:54.560 --> 29:57.840]  Beautifully said, brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[30:00.320 --> 30:05.680]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action. And there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[30:05.680 --> 30:10.240]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating
[30:10.240 --> 30:15.680]  experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[30:15.680 --> 30:21.200]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked
[30:21.200 --> 30:26.800]  up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years. For those of us who have
[30:26.800 --> 30:32.400]  awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening. And it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[30:32.400 --> 30:38.080]  But there is only two things to do. We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[30:38.080 --> 30:44.160]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win. But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[30:44.160 --> 30:49.200]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end. And so we must prepare, get up to a
[30:49.200 --> 30:55.920]  year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[30:55.920 --> 31:02.640]  and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com. Bio remediation is a process used to treat
[31:02.640 --> 31:07.120]  contaminating water, soil and subsurface material by accelerating naturally occurring

[33:26.800 --> 33:31.600]  Very honored to be here. And listen, I like President Trump. He's in battle. He's been
[33:31.600 --> 33:35.520]  targeted. He stood up against the globals. He stood up against China. He did a lot of good things,
[33:35.520 --> 33:42.400]  but I would defend him when CNN had like 50 containers of gumballs up there saying each
[33:42.400 --> 33:51.040]  gumball is a lie. And Trump did not get a lot wrong. And he was dead on and very pragmatic. And
[33:51.040 --> 33:56.400]  I agree with about 95% of what he did. Trump's not stupid. I know a lot of folks have briefed him
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.960]  directly that the vaccines were fraud. They're not vaccines. They're not working. They're now
[34:00.960 --> 34:07.440]  saying again, Pfizer and others are down to less than 40% efficacy. So listen, Trump, we like you
[34:07.440 --> 34:13.200]  because you don't lie to us. Don't lie to us. We don't care if you got conned. You believed in
[34:13.200 --> 34:18.560]  science and they lied to you because this wasn't a cure. It was a disease. Of course they could
[34:18.560 --> 34:22.960]  have given us a real vaccine for it. That's the whole point is he's your mad scientist globalist
[34:22.960 --> 34:28.000]  that give us Trojan horses. I love cell phones. I love the cameras. I love the GPS. I love all
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.880]  the stuff it does, except they're using it to control us and track us and censor us and spy on
[34:32.880 --> 34:40.320]  us. So I take these vaccines like I have a big old slice of pumpkin pie and ice cream on Thanksgiving
[34:40.320 --> 34:47.200]  after I have Turkey, but they don't give us good drugs. They try to suppress the good ones. They
[34:47.200 --> 34:53.520]  try to suppress the treatments. What came out over 10 years ago that in the EU and in the UK and in
[34:53.520 --> 35:01.280]  China, elites get quote, clean vaccines made by secret government labs. Oh, yeah, they got all
[35:01.280 --> 35:06.480]  sorts of great stuff. We ain't getting it. But they're like, oh, you're just against science. You're
[35:06.480 --> 35:11.520]  scared of science. You're scared of innovation. Innovation. That's all we do here at InfoWars.
[35:11.520 --> 35:17.200]  I love technology. I love guns. I don't want somebody shooting me with one.
[35:19.840 --> 35:24.480]  I like a vodka martini. I drink three gallons of it, die of alcohol poisoning.
[35:25.520 --> 35:30.720]  You can't trust the stuff these people are producing because they're eugenicists,
[35:30.720 --> 35:33.920]  depopulationists who've been caught doing it thousands of times.
[35:34.560 --> 35:37.840]  Hey, I found a time magazine. Better vaccine for politicians.
[35:37.840 --> 35:44.320]  And let me tell you what came out this year. They caught all these shots
[35:44.960 --> 35:50.720]  that said not for use in Europe, not for use in America or Canada. And where were they slated for?
[35:50.720 --> 35:57.120]  Africa. Africa. Oh, we got something real special for you, just like I was told by a
[35:57.120 --> 36:03.600]  major doctor that ran a major Texas organization that I was correct.
[36:03.600 --> 36:11.280]  And that decades after they banned the live polio vaccine, that he was part of a state clinic
[36:11.840 --> 36:17.360]  supplying across the state and working on it. And he said that they delivered to the black
[36:17.360 --> 36:24.080]  neighborhoods, including East Austin, live virus, cancer virus vaccine, with SB 40 cancer virus in
[36:24.080 --> 36:28.880]  it. And that to all the other neighborhoods, the white neighborhoods, they did not deliver one
[36:28.880 --> 36:34.000]  with the cancer virus on it. And then the guy got mad at me when he got scared, grabbed by the
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.520]  armistice, don't tell anybody. But I already knew about all that. I don't need him to tell me about
[36:37.520 --> 36:44.880]  it. And he said he stopped that program, but he caught them dumping. I'm trying to explain this
[36:44.880 --> 36:50.240]  again. Hitler got all his ideas from the United States and the UK, not the general public,
[36:50.240 --> 36:55.840]  but from the eugenicists. And then after Hitler World War II, they went underground and they
[36:55.840 --> 37:02.080]  simply trained apprentices like Fauci and Gates and others to keep carrying it out.
[37:03.760 --> 37:11.440]  So I'm all for a polio vaccine, except they were targeting East Austin with the ones that
[37:11.440 --> 37:13.920]  had live virus in it and cancer viruses in it.
[37:17.440 --> 37:21.120]  And I could go all over that because I'm an expert on it, because my grandmother was paralyzed by
[37:21.120 --> 37:26.160]  a vaccine for polio and they told her that. So I've read a lot about it. I know all about it.
[37:27.200 --> 37:33.040]  And I won't sit here and have Trump sit up there and tell me, oh, I took it and I'm fine. You took
[37:33.040 --> 37:40.480]  it and you're fine. You haven't gotten sick yet because you already had all those fancy treatments
[37:40.480 --> 37:48.480]  and all the rest of it last year. But they admit it doesn't work. In fact, here's a great example.
[37:48.480 --> 37:54.960]  Jesse Jackson, the Reverend Jackson, is in a Chicago hospital with his wife, both sick
[37:54.960 --> 37:59.920]  with the Delta variant right now, despite the fact they're both vaccinated. Where do you think the
[37:59.920 --> 38:07.120]  Delta variant came from? The damn mRNA shot, he says he took the Pfizer shot, so did his wife,
[38:07.120 --> 38:12.320]  started replicating in him and now he might die. And his wife might die.
[38:12.320 --> 38:19.840]  See, even Jesse Jackson doesn't have any sense. He believes in this stuff. He believes in the system.
[38:21.760 --> 38:25.440]  After everything they've done to black people, these globalists, Jesse Jackson
[38:26.240 --> 38:31.360]  took the Pfizer shot with his wife and is now fighting for his life from a mutation from the
[38:31.360 --> 38:40.800]  damn injection. But again, I don't want to be mad at Jesse Jackson. I just want him to wake up
[38:40.800 --> 38:44.160]  and then warn people later. But he won't. I guarantee he'll just, if he survives,
[38:44.160 --> 38:48.640]  he'll defend it and won't even know that it was the injection did this to him. He'll probably say,
[38:48.640 --> 38:54.640]  boy, good thing I had that vaccine or, you know, I've been dead. Because there's no numbers and
[38:54.640 --> 39:01.360]  no studies that, quote, when you have the vaccine, it protects you. I mean, you see the surgeon general
[39:01.360 --> 39:07.120]  in his clown outfit up there looking right at the camera saying, natural immunity is not as good
[39:07.120 --> 39:17.520]  as the Pfizer or Moderna immunity. It's three times better. All epidemiology 101, virology 101,
[39:17.520 --> 39:23.920]  all the science says natural immunity is five, 10, 20 times better. And the shots lower your
[39:23.920 --> 39:30.000]  immunity once you take it to other variants. That's what all the scientists say. I got a whole
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.480]  list of them saying it. It's like saying gasoline burns when you light it. That's how dumb they
[39:36.480 --> 39:43.040]  think we are. That's how idiotic they think we are. We have no memory, but that creepy surgeon
[39:43.040 --> 39:48.640]  general looks like a psycho like Fauci like, everything's fine. You'll be fine. And Biden's
[39:48.640 --> 39:52.320]  out there. Oh, if you just take the shot, you're that's why I'm pissed at Trump that we guys find
[39:52.320 --> 39:57.600]  it two weeks ago. He gave a bunch of speech. He said over and over again, Biden says, take the
[39:57.600 --> 40:03.920]  vaccine and you can't get COVID. Remember that? Even though they admit it doesn't even work. And
[40:03.920 --> 40:09.280]  now forget Biden lined us. We've got President Trump doing it. Here it is. You know what? I
[40:09.280 --> 40:14.560]  believe totally in your freedoms. I do agree. You got to do what you have to do. But I recommend
[40:14.560 --> 40:20.480]  take the vaccines. I did it. It's good. Take the vaccines. But you got down. That's okay. That's
[40:20.480 --> 40:27.600]  all right. You got your freedoms. But I happen to take the vaccine. If it doesn't work, you'll be
[40:27.600 --> 40:34.800]  the first to know. Okay. I'll call up Alabama and say, Hey, you know what? But it is working.
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.960]  No, it's not working. Yeah, it's working to grow variants and create mass disease and death,
[40:38.960 --> 40:42.240]  and then let them legitimize even more shots to counter the last variant they made.
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.280]  There it is fully faxed. Jesse Jackson hospitalized with COVID. There you go.
[40:48.960 --> 40:55.280]  Here is Dr. Roger Hodgkinson to dims lack of ethics around lockdowns. Here it is.
[40:55.280 --> 41:03.920]  Yes. Politicians, the media and physicians, particularly MDs who by their cowardly silence
[41:03.920 --> 41:10.240]  have decided to put income ahead of ethics. The ethics we physicians are supposed to hold dear,
[41:10.880 --> 41:17.520]  first do no harm and inform consent. Fear in turn became the excuse for politicians and
[41:17.520 --> 41:24.400]  unelected bureaucrats to enforce the ludicrous totally arbitrary mandates that have no consensus
[41:24.400 --> 41:31.440]  for effectiveness in the medical literature. None. I'm talking here about masks, social distancing,
[41:31.440 --> 41:37.040]  travel bans, and lockdowns. They couldn't work, haven't worked, and will not work.
[41:37.840 --> 41:46.160]  So my third message is simply this. Read my lips. Nothing works except effective prophylaxis
[41:46.160 --> 41:53.440]  with vitamin D and early treatment with Dr. Nicola's protocol. It's just politics playing medicine,
[41:53.440 --> 41:59.600]  and that's a very dangerous game. They dressed themselves in the flag demanding that only they
[41:59.600 --> 42:05.440]  can protect you from all of life's risks. It can't be done. I can tell you with categorical
[42:05.440 --> 42:12.960]  certainty as a pathologist, death happens. Life is risky. Get used to it, just like you did with
[42:12.960 --> 42:19.120]  the past flu epidemics and every day when you drive your car. Governments must get used to the fact
[42:19.120 --> 42:24.560]  that modern medicine is totally impotent at controlling the spread of respiratory viruses.
[42:25.120 --> 42:30.000]  We must simply accommodate to them in ways we have done most effectively in past flu epidemics.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.360]  Let's hit pause right here. We're going to come back to this clip when we come back.
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.520]  But let's just go out to break with President Trump's sidekick now that agrees with him
[42:37.520 --> 42:42.800]  that the vaccine works. Here is President Trump's buddy. They now agree that the vaccine works.
[42:42.800 --> 42:49.600]  Trump now agrees with the liar Biden. Here it is. The various shots that people are getting now
[42:49.600 --> 42:56.000]  cover that. You're okay. You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.680]  No, he's going to get another one and die.
[43:01.520 --> 43:06.080]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[43:06.080 --> 43:08.640]  Don't.
[43:36.080 --> 44:05.140]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[44:05.140 --> 44:10.560]  we are told. And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which
[44:10.560 --> 44:16.100]  is why fluoridated water is a big problem. Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate
[44:16.100 --> 44:21.600]  crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions. Natural functions
[44:21.600 --> 44:26.520]  which have been known for millennia. The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[44:26.520 --> 44:31.720]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye. Also described as the seat
[44:31.720 --> 44:37.820]  of the soul. The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise
[44:37.820 --> 44:44.060]  unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland
[44:44.060 --> 44:49.560]  healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking
[44:49.560 --> 44:55.320]  water fluoride free and the propure shower head will seal the deal. Get them both today
[44:55.320 --> 45:02.320]  for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[45:25.320 --> 45:29.960]  We have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[45:29.960 --> 45:34.160]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[45:34.160 --> 45:39.440]  others is absolutely essential. And at the same time supporting info wars by buying high
[45:39.440 --> 45:43.040]  quality products to keep us on air is essential because they are great products for you and

[45:49.940 --> 45:53.740]  is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because supply chain breakdowns
[45:53.740 --> 45:56.180]  are back in like bodies, vassal beats and others.

[45:58.300 --> 46:00.460]  and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[46:00.460 --> 46:04.300]  The first time I heard the speech,
[46:04.300 --> 46:07.860]  the first time I read the writings of Teddy Roosevelt,
[46:07.860 --> 46:11.900]  I was in sixth grade and we had this history teacher
[46:11.900 --> 46:14.940]  that had us write a paper on the man in the arena.
[46:14.940 --> 46:16.580]  And I just remember thinking about that and saying,
[46:16.580 --> 46:18.820]  I wanna be the man in the arena.
[46:18.820 --> 46:19.820]  But when it comes to media,
[46:19.820 --> 46:22.100]  info wars has been the tip of that spear.
[46:22.100 --> 46:25.340]  But Mike Lindell has come along and done just as good
[46:25.340 --> 46:27.740]  a job as we've done, maybe even better
[46:27.740 --> 46:30.300]  when it comes to election fraud and other issues.
[46:30.300 --> 46:32.540]  And that's why if you go to mypillow.com

[46:44.180 --> 46:46.180]  and the fight for free speech against the globalists.

[46:54.500 --> 46:56.620]  and it stands up against these globalist bullies.
[46:56.620 --> 47:00.420]  Mypillow.com, promo code Alex, take action now.
[47:03.740 --> 47:06.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.660 --> 47:13.460]  The Alex Jones Show
[47:17.100 --> 47:18.860]  By the way, if you go to the full show headline
[47:18.860 --> 47:20.740]  of the broadcast that I write each day
[47:20.740 --> 47:22.660]  before we go live on air,
[47:22.660 --> 47:24.060]  it says Sunday Live,
[47:24.060 --> 47:25.780]  massive protest explode worldwide
[47:25.780 --> 47:28.380]  against UN Great Reset tyranny.
[47:28.380 --> 47:29.780]  And that really is the big news.
[47:29.780 --> 47:31.420]  We're talking millions in France,
[47:31.420 --> 47:33.580]  millions in Australia,
[47:33.580 --> 47:34.980]  overrunning the police,
[47:34.980 --> 47:36.300]  overrunning the shopping malls,
[47:36.300 --> 47:37.460]  the grocery stores,
[47:37.460 --> 47:40.420]  saying no to the COVID checkpoints,
[47:40.420 --> 47:42.180]  saying they know it's the Great Reset,
[47:42.180 --> 47:46.340]  that they're chanting Jail Fauci, Jail Schwab,
[47:46.340 --> 47:47.260]  all over the world.
[47:47.260 --> 47:49.700]  And so this is really exciting and positive
[47:49.700 --> 47:52.580]  and I should just be focusing on the human spring
[47:53.580 --> 47:54.700]  against the globalist.
[47:54.700 --> 47:56.900]  But it is, it is very, very exciting
[47:56.900 --> 47:59.180]  to see people standing up to these thugs.
[47:59.180 --> 48:01.540]  You know, the police buy the idea in these countries
[48:01.540 --> 48:03.540]  that, oh, they're protecting people from the virus.
[48:03.540 --> 48:04.460]  I know you're not.
[48:04.460 --> 48:06.220]  The globalists have launched this.
[48:06.220 --> 48:07.820]  It's in all the Rockefeller documents
[48:07.820 --> 48:10.620]  and that's why it's critical to get that information out.
[48:10.620 --> 48:12.860]  They're trying to give people five years in prison
[48:12.860 --> 48:15.460]  that organize a protest in Australia.
[48:15.460 --> 48:18.060]  All that's gonna do is have people start burning stuff down
[48:18.060 --> 48:19.860]  and getting really lawless,
[48:19.860 --> 48:21.300]  which I'm not calling for.
[48:21.300 --> 48:23.900]  I'm just saying, you act like Nazis,
[48:23.900 --> 48:26.580]  you're gonna get a French resistance, a literal one.
[48:26.580 --> 48:29.180]  And so, okay, start killing us, start beating people up,
[48:29.180 --> 48:30.340]  start burning things down.
[48:30.340 --> 48:33.180]  See how it goes for you.
[48:33.180 --> 48:35.540]  Because you've taken our restraint for weakness
[48:35.540 --> 48:38.020]  and it is the opposite.
[48:38.020 --> 48:40.420]  So yeah, just roll some of the video and audio,
[48:40.420 --> 48:42.420]  like one guy, because they're saying
[48:42.420 --> 48:44.820]  you can't leave from one state, one province,
[48:44.820 --> 48:47.940]  one province of Australia, the other for over a year and a half.
[48:47.940 --> 48:50.300]  It's been like 10 deaths the last eight, nine months,
[48:50.300 --> 48:51.980]  that they're building emergency camps.
[48:51.980 --> 48:54.540]  They're saying we're gonna forcibly inoculate you.
[48:54.540 --> 48:55.780]  They're saying we're gonna keep the lockdown going
[48:55.780 --> 48:57.580]  until you accept all the injections.
[48:58.460 --> 49:02.180]  And then I love this guy on a horse riding around,
[49:02.180 --> 49:03.300]  saying let's cross the border
[49:03.300 --> 49:06.180]  and then tens of thousands cross the border in the next state
[49:06.180 --> 49:08.340]  and just overrun the police.
[49:08.340 --> 49:12.740]  Again, who are absolutely shameful and evil people,
[49:12.740 --> 49:14.740]  but nothing compared to the politicians
[49:14.740 --> 49:18.540]  and the leadership that know exactly what they're doing.
[49:21.180 --> 49:23.380]  So all of the world, history's taking place.
[49:24.780 --> 49:29.180]  And then in the former Eastern Bloc,
[49:29.180 --> 49:30.260]  they just don't do any of it
[49:30.260 --> 49:32.420]  and basically have no cover cases.
[49:32.420 --> 49:33.980]  And their shopping malls are totally open,
[49:33.980 --> 49:34.900]  their stores are open,
[49:34.900 --> 49:37.820]  no one's wearing masks in Romania or Hungary or wherever.
[49:37.820 --> 49:40.180]  Express their frustration.
[49:40.180 --> 49:41.580]  Express their frustration.
[49:41.580 --> 49:43.060]  This is all an exercise of power.
[49:43.060 --> 49:46.300]  We have some protesters, they're trying to break through.
[49:46.300 --> 49:47.620]  Oh, they didn't try, they did it.
[49:47.620 --> 49:50.260]  We've got mounted police also trying
[49:50.260 --> 49:52.340]  to stop the demonstration.
[49:52.340 --> 49:53.340]  Just keep pushing.
[49:56.340 --> 49:58.820]  But I'm gonna air this later in the next hour
[49:58.820 --> 49:59.780]  on own shores with me.
[49:59.780 --> 50:02.500]  I'm gonna get into Klaus Schwab in the clip where he says,
[50:02.500 --> 50:05.220]  you're very angry, soon the great resets you over.
[50:05.220 --> 50:06.980]  They're making you angry, they're shutting you down,
[50:06.980 --> 50:08.860]  they're saying you can't have a job
[50:08.860 --> 50:10.420]  until they fully enslave you.
[50:10.420 --> 50:12.260]  That's the operation.
[50:13.820 --> 50:15.900]  I got a bunch of clips from Australians talking about
[50:15.900 --> 50:18.860]  what it's like to live there, to be actual prisoners now.
[50:18.860 --> 50:21.660]  Where, folks, I have real videos
[50:21.660 --> 50:23.460]  of three different government ministers
[50:23.460 --> 50:25.660]  of three different states.
[50:25.660 --> 50:27.380]  You say, well, who cares about Australia?
[50:27.380 --> 50:30.700]  Well, that's the model of the world
[50:30.700 --> 50:32.140]  that they admit it's coming here.
[50:32.140 --> 50:33.580]  They're building the same FEMA camps here,
[50:33.580 --> 50:36.140]  same stuff in Canada, same stuff in Europe.
[50:36.140 --> 50:37.300]  And they say,
[50:37.300 --> 50:38.300]  and they say
[50:40.500 --> 50:43.180]  that you cannot look at the sunset.
[50:43.180 --> 50:44.660]  I'll play that clip next hour.
[50:44.660 --> 50:47.420]  Government ministers say, do not look at the sunset
[50:47.420 --> 50:49.060]  and do not even talk to your neighbors
[50:49.060 --> 50:52.780]  and do not look at people in the eye even from a distance.
[50:52.780 --> 50:54.220]  Now, that's gaslighting.
[50:54.220 --> 50:56.140]  That's beyond Jim Jones' occult leader.
[50:56.140 --> 50:58.300]  That's to see what they can get you to do
[50:58.300 --> 51:00.860]  because they are bringing in an authoritarian regime
[51:00.860 --> 51:03.260]  and building death camps.
[51:03.260 --> 51:04.100]  You say, why?
[51:04.100 --> 51:05.780]  Because it's an authoritarian takeover.
[51:05.780 --> 51:09.180]  Do you understand that I have here in my hand
[51:10.940 --> 51:11.940]  Wikipedia?
[51:12.940 --> 51:13.780]  And I'm gonna show you,
[51:13.780 --> 51:15.420]  the only reason this matters is,
[51:15.420 --> 51:17.140]  when I show you a Klaus Schwab's book,
[51:17.140 --> 51:18.540]  or I show you a clip of him on TV,
[51:18.540 --> 51:20.820]  running things, people don't care.
[51:20.820 --> 51:22.340]  This is Wikipedia,
[51:22.340 --> 51:24.940]  and then transcripts and mainstream news saying it's good,
[51:24.940 --> 51:25.940]  saying, quote,
[51:29.660 --> 51:32.060]  our goal is to capture democratic structures
[51:32.060 --> 51:35.020]  and institutions so that the people have no choice
[51:35.020 --> 51:36.460]  and no control of their lives.
[51:36.460 --> 51:38.980]  And so the United Nations and corporate stakeholders
[51:38.980 --> 51:41.860]  can control the entire direction of humanity's future.
[51:44.100 --> 51:44.940]  Gotta read that.
[51:47.220 --> 51:49.780]  That's called total North Korea slavery.
[51:53.700 --> 51:55.860]  That's in his bio Wikipedia.
[51:58.300 --> 51:59.740]  I mean, give me a break.
[51:59.740 --> 52:02.500]  He's the former head of the Bilderberg group.
[52:02.500 --> 52:05.540]  Remember when that didn't exist and we exposed it?
[52:05.540 --> 52:07.140]  They've been hiding in the shadows forever.
[52:07.140 --> 52:09.380]  Now they brought their agenda out in the open.
[52:13.900 --> 52:16.020]  So let's go ahead, I've got a new term though,
[52:16.020 --> 52:18.180]  because it looks like Trump's turning into this.
[52:21.020 --> 52:22.740]  If Trump's merging with Biden,
[52:22.740 --> 52:24.660]  and both he and Biden are lying to us saying
[52:24.660 --> 52:27.220]  the vaccine works and is effective and is a vaccine,
[52:27.220 --> 52:29.980]  when they admit it has like 30% efficacy now,
[52:29.980 --> 52:32.900]  is it tri-Biden, Trump and Biden?
[52:32.900 --> 52:36.020]  Is it tri-Biden or is it brump or bump?
[52:36.900 --> 52:40.060]  We should probably have one of the writers create a poll.
[52:40.060 --> 52:43.100]  What should the merger of Trump and Biden be called?
[52:43.100 --> 52:48.100]  Should it be called tri-Biden, brump, bump, or dump?
[52:49.820 --> 52:50.660]  I don't know.
[52:52.260 --> 52:54.060]  And I'm just trying to take Trump to the damn woodshed
[52:54.060 --> 52:56.700]  because he's close to flipping back to reality,
[52:56.700 --> 53:00.260]  but my God, I'm not gonna sit here and be fed a bunch of,
[53:00.260 --> 53:02.300]  but yes, here's Biden just a month ago,
[53:02.300 --> 53:04.100]  a couple of weeks ago, telling you the vaccine works
[53:04.100 --> 53:05.460]  when it's not a vaccine, doesn't work,
[53:05.460 --> 53:07.900]  and then Trump's had the same thing being booed last night.
[53:07.900 --> 53:10.380]  Maybe a little hint, Trump, here it is.
[53:10.380 --> 53:14.620]  The various shots that people are getting now,
[53:14.620 --> 53:19.140]  cover that, you're okay, you're not gonna get COVID
[53:19.140 --> 53:21.460]  if you have these vaccinations.
[53:21.460 --> 53:23.580]  You know what, I believe totally in your freedoms,
[53:23.580 --> 53:25.420]  I do, you gotta do what you have to do,
[53:25.420 --> 53:28.460]  but I recommend take the vaccines,
[53:28.460 --> 53:30.500]  I did it, it's good, take the vaccines,
[53:30.500 --> 53:34.380]  but you got, now that's okay, that's all right.
[53:34.380 --> 53:38.940]  You got your freedoms, but I happen to take the vaccine.
[53:38.940 --> 53:41.860]  If it doesn't work, you'll be the first to know, okay?
[53:41.860 --> 53:45.100]  We don't need you to tell us, we are the first to know,
[53:45.100 --> 53:46.820]  that's why we put you in office.
[53:46.820 --> 53:49.340]  So if you wanna sit there and not admit you got COVID,
[53:49.340 --> 53:50.180]  that's fine.
[53:51.100 --> 53:54.700]  Trump has now officially merged as a community clone
[53:54.700 --> 53:56.820]  with Joe Biden.
[53:57.980 --> 54:00.900]  Okay, let's go ahead now and finish up
[54:00.900 --> 54:03.940]  with that medical doctor who he tried off
[54:03.940 --> 54:05.940]  because of the break, clip 21.
[54:06.820 --> 54:08.780]  Getting into what's really happening,
[54:08.780 --> 54:11.780]  here is Dr. Roger Hodgkinson.
[54:11.780 --> 54:13.860]  I can tell you with categorical certainty
[54:13.860 --> 54:18.380]  as a pathologist, death happens, life is risky,
[54:18.380 --> 54:20.700]  get used to it, just like you did
[54:20.700 --> 54:22.460]  with the past flu epidemics,
[54:22.460 --> 54:25.300]  and every day when you drive your car.
[54:25.300 --> 54:27.100]  Governments must get used to the fact
[54:27.100 --> 54:29.980]  that modern medicine is totally impotent
[54:29.980 --> 54:33.140]  at controlling the spread of respiratory viruses.
[54:33.140 --> 54:34.780]  We must simply accommodate to them
[54:34.780 --> 54:36.860]  in ways we have done most effectively
[54:36.860 --> 54:40.020]  in past flu epidemics, with literal doses
[54:40.020 --> 54:43.420]  of the cheapest, most effective medicine there is.
[54:43.420 --> 54:44.940]  Common sense.
[54:46.060 --> 54:48.900]  Flip Flop Fauci created COVID-19
[54:48.900 --> 54:50.540]  when his gain of function research
[54:50.540 --> 54:53.100]  escaped from the lab in Wuhan.
[54:53.100 --> 54:55.420]  You shouldn't be forced to put your life
[54:55.420 --> 54:57.580]  and your child's life on the line
[54:57.580 --> 55:01.980]  by getting vexed just to solve the problem he created.
[55:01.980 --> 55:06.980]  That is government tyranny and indescribably offensive.
[55:07.020 --> 55:09.980]  So for God's sake, don't let them scare you
[55:09.980 --> 55:11.700]  into getting vexed.
[55:11.700 --> 55:14.020]  Tell them to stop the shot.
[55:14.900 --> 55:15.740]  Thank you.
[55:17.500 --> 55:20.020]  The whole world is going into captivity
[55:20.020 --> 55:21.380]  until we're on a world ID,
[55:21.380 --> 55:22.860]  and the system can put what they want
[55:22.860 --> 55:24.340]  in our bodies when they want.
[55:24.340 --> 55:26.540]  We've got incredible footage next hour of Ireland,
[55:26.540 --> 55:28.540]  them coming to people's houses, beating them up.
[55:28.540 --> 55:29.820]  If somebody said they might have COVID,
[55:29.820 --> 55:33.500]  it's all ridiculous what the borders again are wide open.
[55:33.500 --> 55:35.980]  Here's an important clip from an Australian captive
[55:35.980 --> 55:39.020]  speaks out on the horrors of currently living
[55:39.020 --> 55:40.220]  in the police state.
[55:41.900 --> 55:44.220]  We're not allowed to travel more than five kilometers
[55:44.220 --> 55:46.700]  from our house even to get groceries.
[55:46.700 --> 55:48.340]  We try to order groceries online,
[55:48.340 --> 55:50.540]  particularly Western Sydney here,
[55:50.540 --> 55:52.580]  which is facing the worst lockdowns
[55:52.580 --> 55:56.220]  where people can't go to work unless they've had the job.
[55:56.220 --> 55:58.340]  And you try to order groceries online,
[55:58.340 --> 56:00.860]  and they're inundated.
[56:00.860 --> 56:03.340]  So we're in a really difficult situation.
[56:03.340 --> 56:05.620]  They've just, we previously had a rule
[56:05.620 --> 56:07.860]  where there was what's called a singles bubble
[56:07.860 --> 56:10.500]  where you can go and see your friend
[56:10.500 --> 56:11.900]  if you don't have a partner.
[56:11.900 --> 56:13.460]  Now that's changed as well,
[56:13.460 --> 56:15.580]  where you have to actually register one person
[56:15.580 --> 56:17.340]  only that you're allowed to visit.
[56:17.340 --> 56:18.780]  And that person needs to be no more
[56:18.780 --> 56:21.380]  than five kilometers from your house.
[56:21.380 --> 56:25.460]  It is tyranny, tyranny.
[56:25.460 --> 56:28.020]  Wasn't there a day when they said it was,
[56:28.020 --> 56:30.100]  wasn't it supposed to end like last week
[56:30.100 --> 56:31.460]  or like, or did they extend it?
[56:31.460 --> 56:32.300]  What happened with that?
[56:32.300 --> 56:33.140]  It never does.
[56:33.140 --> 56:35.260]  So as of last night, they've announced
[56:35.260 --> 56:37.300]  that it's going to get even harsher.
[56:37.300 --> 56:41.300]  And our premier actually used the word war
[56:41.300 --> 56:42.820]  on television yesterday.
[56:42.820 --> 56:45.660]  She said, this is literally a war.
[56:45.660 --> 56:48.420]  So she's the same one, let's put it down.
[56:48.420 --> 56:49.900]  She's the same one that said,
[56:49.900 --> 56:51.060]  don't talk to your neighbors.
[56:51.060 --> 56:52.420]  And I'm not joking.
[56:52.420 --> 56:53.620]  Don't look at the sunset.
[56:53.620 --> 56:55.460]  Don't even leave your house.
[56:55.460 --> 56:57.580]  They see on your porch, they come after you now.
[56:57.580 --> 56:58.580]  Because you put up with it,
[56:58.580 --> 56:59.940]  so now it's more, more, more.
[56:59.940 --> 57:01.580]  But it's a paradox with the Aussies.
[57:01.580 --> 57:03.300]  Now they're up to about 25%
[57:03.300 --> 57:05.780]  that have accepted the deadly injection.
[57:05.780 --> 57:07.500]  So the leaders are saying,
[57:07.500 --> 57:09.020]  well, you have to go to 70%
[57:09.020 --> 57:10.380]  before we let you out of your houses.
[57:10.380 --> 57:12.900]  But you know, once it hits 70, they're going to want 100.
[57:12.900 --> 57:13.860]  These are criminals.
[57:13.860 --> 57:14.700]  Oh, by the way,
[57:14.700 --> 57:16.380]  there's big press conferences this week.
[57:16.380 --> 57:17.220]  It's in all the studies.
[57:17.220 --> 57:19.060]  More studies just came out.
[57:19.060 --> 57:20.620]  These, these Moderna and Pfizer shots
[57:20.620 --> 57:22.740]  are attacking the ovaries and uterus.
[57:22.740 --> 57:25.620]  And I've got clips on that coming up as well.
[57:25.620 --> 57:27.740]  But Owen Schreuer is going to be joining us.
[57:27.740 --> 57:30.180]  In studio, he reports to jail tomorrow
[57:31.460 --> 57:33.660]  for his thought crimes.
[57:33.660 --> 57:34.940]  He was at the Capitol
[57:34.940 --> 57:37.140]  and didn't even bullhorn anybody,
[57:37.140 --> 57:39.460]  but he was there and tried to,
[57:39.460 --> 57:40.500]  tried to stop what happened.
[57:40.500 --> 57:41.940]  And so they lied about him
[57:41.940 --> 57:43.780]  and created a false, false charge.
[57:43.780 --> 57:45.620]  This is the criminal activity of the government.
[57:45.620 --> 57:46.460]  We're right back.
[57:49.900 --> 57:52.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, fighting illegal battles
[57:52.060 --> 57:54.780]  is not fun and it's not cheap.
[57:54.780 --> 57:57.940]  Trust me, we know all about that here at Info Wars.
[57:57.940 --> 57:59.380]  And now, unfortunately,
[57:59.380 --> 58:03.620]  I have become a big political target of the new world order
[58:03.620 --> 58:07.260]  and of the Democrat party and of the mainstream media.
[58:07.260 --> 58:10.380]  Now I'm just one in a group of many that they are targeting,
[58:10.380 --> 58:12.180]  but boy, oh boy, they coming after me now.
[58:12.180 --> 58:14.300]  And so I need your financial assistance
[58:14.300 --> 58:16.620]  at defendoan.com.
[58:16.620 --> 58:18.660]  I'm gonna have to have lawyers working on this case
[58:18.660 --> 58:20.580]  all the time, unfortunately.
[58:20.580 --> 58:21.740]  It's not gonna be cheap.
[58:21.740 --> 58:22.780]  It's not gonna be fun,
[58:22.780 --> 58:24.500]  but you can ease some of the stress,
[58:24.500 --> 58:26.260]  ease some of the financial burden
[58:26.260 --> 58:28.260]  by going to defendoan.com
[58:28.260 --> 58:29.860]  if you're able to financially support.
[58:29.860 --> 58:32.140]  Of course, your words of support mean everything.
[58:32.140 --> 58:33.780]  Your prayers are paramount,
[58:33.780 --> 58:36.740]  but defendoan.com for financial support
[58:36.740 --> 58:38.300]  so that I can be sure
[58:38.300 --> 58:41.340]  that I have the best legal team for this defense,
[58:41.340 --> 58:44.020]  which is gonna be key for free speech
[58:44.020 --> 58:46.420]  and for the truth and to keep me on air.
[58:46.420 --> 58:49.300]  Thank you for going to defendoan.com.
[58:50.500 --> 58:53.340]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action,
[58:53.340 --> 58:55.860]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[58:55.860 --> 58:58.860]  Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[58:58.860 --> 59:01.780]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[59:01.780 --> 59:03.340]  because they were told to be afraid
[59:03.340 --> 59:05.940]  of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[59:05.940 --> 59:08.980]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[59:08.980 --> 59:11.580]  of having 80% of the population hooked up
[59:11.580 --> 59:14.220]  to an artificial intelligence hive mind
[59:14.220 --> 59:15.940]  in less than nine years.
[59:15.940 --> 59:18.300]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[59:18.300 --> 59:20.140]  we know this is all really happening,
[59:20.140 --> 59:22.700]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see,
[59:22.700 --> 59:25.260]  but there is only two things to do.
[59:25.260 --> 59:26.900]  We continue sounding the alarm
[59:26.900 --> 59:28.380]  because it's a numbers game.
[59:28.380 --> 59:31.700]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[59:31.700 --> 59:34.420]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[59:34.420 --> 59:37.100]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end,
[59:37.100 --> 59:39.900]  and so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth
[59:39.900 --> 59:43.820]  of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear,
[59:43.820 --> 59:47.860]  seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge
[59:47.860 --> 59:49.940]  at infoorstore.com.
[59:53.300 --> 59:56.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:56.380 --> 1:00:24.780]  🎵
[1:00:24.780 --> 1:00:29.620]  So here's Dr. Christine Northup talking about infertility attacks on the
[1:00:29.620 --> 1:00:36.540]  uterus and then Dr. Elizabeth Villet MD talks about it as well then we are also
[1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:40.980]  going to get to some more medical doctors and what they're saying and what's
[1:00:40.980 --> 1:00:46.140]  happening and what's going on but first off let's go ahead and play those two
[1:00:46.140 --> 1:00:52.340]  female doctors back-to-back. Thousands of reports of menstrual irregularities and
[1:00:52.340 --> 1:00:57.500]  reproductive dysfunction following COVID vaccine so the media has focused on
[1:00:57.500 --> 1:01:02.260]  blood clots but then we had suddenly all of these women and a friend of mine
[1:01:02.260 --> 1:01:09.420]  today literally sent me a picture of what came out of her body she's a woman in
[1:01:09.420 --> 1:01:17.380]  her 30s. Entire decidual casts they're called meaning that the entire inside of
[1:01:17.380 --> 1:01:22.660]  the uterus just sloughs off decidua meaning like deciduous trees that shed
[1:01:22.660 --> 1:01:30.180]  their leaves. The menstrual cycle is one of the indices of health so we know
[1:01:30.180 --> 1:01:36.940]  that a regular menstrual cycle that's every 25 to 30 days is considered one of
[1:01:36.940 --> 1:01:43.060]  the ways that we determine a woman's health and when suddenly you have
[1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:48.980]  thousands of people all over the world many of whom have not been vaccinated
[1:01:48.980 --> 1:01:53.940]  but have been around those who have we begin to wonder now we already know
[1:01:53.940 --> 1:02:00.220]  that polysorbate 80 which is included in these shots can adversely affect ovarian
[1:02:00.220 --> 1:02:06.060]  function and a shutdown ovarian function and rats. There are things called
[1:02:06.060 --> 1:02:10.940]  pheromones that are secreted by the applicant's sweat glands in the pubic
[1:02:10.940 --> 1:02:17.500]  area and under the armpits those regulate women's menstrual cycles that's the
[1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:22.220]  pheromones are why we think women have periods at the same time when they're
[1:02:22.220 --> 1:02:27.260]  all living together in close proximity. There are so many things that affect the
[1:02:27.260 --> 1:02:34.380]  menstrual cycle but the reports that we are getting are not only swelling of the
[1:02:34.380 --> 1:02:42.420]  genitals, erectile dysfunction in males, scrotum swelling, problems of this
[1:02:42.420 --> 1:02:47.580]  nature, breast irregularities, all of that. This is from the the yellow card
[1:02:47.580 --> 1:02:55.460]  voluntary program in England but we don't have any database right at this
[1:02:55.460 --> 1:03:01.780]  very moment formal database for these abnormalities that are occurring when
[1:03:01.780 --> 1:03:08.060]  you're simply around someone who's been who's had this shot. So I would like to
[1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:16.180]  urge the young people listening to you please you are not at risk of COVID
[1:03:16.180 --> 1:03:21.940]  dying or going into the hospital young people get over COVID quickly the
[1:03:21.940 --> 1:03:26.740]  vaccines don't protect you against the variants and we have data we're bringing
[1:03:26.740 --> 1:03:32.020]  out in the press conference next week about the damage to the ovaries and the
[1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:39.580]  testicles in young people please don't jump into getting a vaccine until you
[1:03:39.580 --> 1:03:45.460]  get the data from the risk and we have that posted on our website it's it's
[1:03:45.460 --> 1:03:51.340]  just so important for your long-range help don't rush into a pressured
[1:03:51.340 --> 1:03:58.300]  decision take time to find out what the risk really are and the fact that there
[1:03:58.300 --> 1:04:03.100]  are treatment options you don't need to rush into something experimental so
[1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:11.340]  please join us at truthforhealth.org we are crusading to help all of the
[1:04:11.340 --> 1:04:17.460]  voiceless patients have a place of helpful truthful balanced medically
[1:04:17.460 --> 1:04:22.300]  sound approaches and I literally have hundreds of these clubs every day I
[1:04:22.300 --> 1:04:26.540]  could play a lot prominent science doctors Nobel Prize winners all saying
[1:04:26.540 --> 1:04:30.740]  the same thing and I've got all these different studies showing that they did
[1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:34.420]  previous trials on animals fouts you did they actually know what this does and it
[1:04:34.420 --> 1:04:37.980]  basically eats the uterus eats the ovaries eats the testicles they've
[1:04:37.980 --> 1:04:43.100]  done it this is a population plan it's incredible all right Owen shroyer soon
[1:04:43.100 --> 1:04:46.580]  to be a political president pray for him he's right here next to me when we
[1:04:46.580 --> 1:04:50.180]  come back on the Sunday transmission of the whole host with me and they'll
[1:04:50.180 --> 1:04:53.980]  co-host Sunday Live 6 8 p.m. for who knows how long we'll get back hopefully
[1:04:53.980 --> 1:04:58.420]  very very soon but we'll see a lot of folks disappear forever

[1:05:49.900 --> 1:05:53.900]  words this is not a joke
[1:06:02.220 --> 1:06:08.940]  August 22nd a live Sunday broadcast with soon to be political president
[1:06:08.940 --> 1:06:15.660]  destroyer mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will
[1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:22.820]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones Tucker
[1:06:22.820 --> 1:06:26.020]  Carlson knocked it out of the park Friday night doing most of his hour-long
[1:06:26.020 --> 1:06:30.460]  transmission on all the evidence of the FBI and deep state provocaturing
[1:06:30.460 --> 1:06:35.860]  January 6 but there was a big Reuters article of senior FBI officials off
[1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:39.460]  record saying that Trump myself Roger Stone had all been investigated we did
[1:06:39.460 --> 1:06:43.980]  not premeditatedly order folks to attack the Capitol so to scapegoat that story
[1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:47.140]  to change the subject they had an investigation waiting in the wings of a
[1:06:47.140 --> 1:06:52.620]  totally innocent man oh and shroyer info wars co-host so here's Tucker Carlson's
[1:06:52.620 --> 1:06:57.300]  coverage of that as a rule federal law enforcement agencies like the FBI are not
[1:06:57.300 --> 1:07:00.980]  in the business of exonerating people that is definitely not their job their
[1:07:00.980 --> 1:07:05.660]  job is to investigate crimes gather evidence and provide that evidence to
[1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:08.940]  prosecutors that's where criminal justice system works you were innocent
[1:07:08.940 --> 1:07:12.980]  until proven guilty that's the whole point so the FBI doesn't declare you
[1:07:12.980 --> 1:07:17.900]  innocent that's the assumption we all get from the beginning the Constitution
[1:07:17.900 --> 1:07:21.700]  makes that very clear again it's the whole point of our justice system so
[1:07:21.700 --> 1:07:25.620]  it's worth paying attention when the FBI makes a point of exonerating large
[1:07:25.620 --> 1:07:29.660]  groups of people no matter who those people are and that happened today when
[1:07:29.660 --> 1:07:35.620]  several FBI sources told Reuters that in fact January 6 was not an insurrection
[1:07:35.620 --> 1:07:40.940]  after all according to Reuters there won't be quote any charges alleging that
[1:07:40.940 --> 1:07:46.260]  any individual or group played a central role in organizing or leading the riot so
[1:07:46.260 --> 1:07:50.580]  there was no plan to overturn the election there was no coordination at all
[1:07:50.580 --> 1:07:56.540]  as one law enforcement source told Reuters quote 90 to 95% of these are
[1:07:56.540 --> 1:08:01.060]  one-off cases then you have 5% maybe of these militia groups that were more
[1:08:01.060 --> 1:08:06.020]  closely organized but there was no grand scheme with Roger Stone and Alex Jones
[1:08:06.020 --> 1:08:10.780]  and all of these people to storm the Capitol and take hostages therefore
[1:08:10.780 --> 1:08:14.740]  don't expect any more charges for conspiracy or sedition or anything like
[1:08:14.740 --> 1:08:22.380]  that huh what is this since when does the FBI go out of its way to leak
[1:08:22.380 --> 1:08:28.660]  information exonerating Roger Stone and Alex Jones what is going on here as a
[1:08:28.660 --> 1:08:33.260]  threshold matter it's worth remembering what the FBI was claiming for the last
[1:08:33.260 --> 1:08:38.620]  eight months on January 30th of this year the FBI planted this story in the
[1:08:38.620 --> 1:08:44.260]  Washington Post one of many quote FBI probe of US Capitol riot finds evidence
[1:08:44.260 --> 1:08:50.340]  detailing coordination of an assault meanwhile every national security expert
[1:08:50.340 --> 1:08:54.820]  including the former FBI director repeated that line verbatim on television
[1:08:54.820 --> 1:08:59.020]  for the entire year what we're learning about how the insurrection was planned
[1:08:59.020 --> 1:09:04.060]  and new warnings about the threat we still face you really don't end up with
[1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:09.980]  a crowd of that size of that direction of that cohesiveness without a
[1:09:09.980 --> 1:09:14.980]  significant degree of pre-planning every law enforcement leader has said that
[1:09:14.980 --> 1:09:18.980]  this was coordinated and planned all the witnesses agreeing this was planned this
[1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:23.580]  was a planned coordinated attack these are not toys these are not misfits this
[1:09:23.580 --> 1:09:27.100]  was an organized insurrection and all the images that you're showing prove
[1:09:27.100 --> 1:09:30.820]  that there's no doubt there were at least some conspiracies people wandering
[1:09:30.820 --> 1:09:34.500]  around exercising their First Amendment rights don't bring ropes and ladders and
[1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:39.180]  sledgehammers to a spontaneous event this was a planned assault as if going
[1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:47.220]  after a castle these people are so dishonest what they don't want to admit
[1:09:47.220 --> 1:09:52.100]  is that the people who were there that day thought the election was stolen from
[1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:56.220]  them why did they think that because the way that we vote was changed at the
[1:09:56.220 --> 1:10:01.500]  last minute using COVID as a pretext because the tech companies working at
[1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:06.340]  the behest of the Democratic National Committee shut down opposition online to
[1:10:06.340 --> 1:10:10.140]  the Democratic candidate is that a fair election if that were happening in
[1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:14.980]  Hungary would we say that's totally fine that's cool that's democracy no and
[1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:19.740]  every American knew that and some of them were mad enough to go to Washington and
[1:10:19.740 --> 1:10:23.340]  some misbehaved and broke the law we're not defending that but the idea that this
[1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:27.380]  was coordinated by white supremacists no it was Americans who believed in
[1:10:27.380 --> 1:10:32.620]  democracy until they saw it thwarted by the people you just saw on TV so now the
[1:10:32.620 --> 1:10:36.460]  FBI admits there was no insurrection every normal person knew that at the time
[1:10:36.460 --> 1:10:40.260]  Chewbacca guy wasn't leading a plot to overthrow the US government what a lie
[1:10:40.260 --> 1:10:46.220]  so what is going on here we'll keep in mind this the FBI has never stated
[1:10:46.220 --> 1:10:50.820]  publicly or otherwise how many of its agents or proxies were involved that
[1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:55.580]  day it's pretty clear if there was organization going on some of it came
[1:10:55.580 --> 1:11:00.100]  from the feds that's true we were attacked for saying it but it's true
[1:11:00.100 --> 1:11:04.540]  court filings from the DOJ show the government identified many alleged
[1:11:04.540 --> 1:11:08.180]  ringleaders of the insurrection but weirdly those people are never charged
[1:11:08.180 --> 1:11:12.940]  those ringleaders appear to have been working for the FBI and there were a lot
[1:11:12.940 --> 1:11:18.260]  of them in all revolver news has reported there are quote upwards of 20
[1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:22.500]  unindicted co-conspirators on the January 6th indictments all playing
[1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:26.580]  various roles in the conspiracy who have not been charged for virtually the same
[1:11:26.580 --> 1:11:30.940]  activities and in some cases much much more severe activities as those named
[1:11:30.940 --> 1:11:35.820]  alongside them in the indictments end quote that's not some whack job right
[1:11:35.820 --> 1:11:39.020]  wing opinion you can check the indictments for yourself if you want and
[1:11:39.020 --> 1:11:44.060]  you should so the question is how many of those unindicted co-conspirators were
[1:11:44.060 --> 1:11:50.300]  working for the DOJ that's a good question one that nobody seems interested
[1:11:50.300 --> 1:11:54.140]  in answering Dick Cheney's daughters out there every day demanding that we have
[1:11:54.140 --> 1:11:58.140]  this investigation added Kinziger cried about it on TV but they don't want to
[1:11:58.140 --> 1:12:02.140]  answer that question why is that exactly well today's announcement from the FBI
[1:12:02.140 --> 1:12:06.580]  guarantees that none of those ringleaders will ever be charged oh that
[1:12:06.580 --> 1:12:11.020]  means if they were working for the FBI if they were agents or informants like the
[1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:14.180]  leaders of the plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan for example there's
[1:12:14.180 --> 1:12:19.380]  no a very good chance we will never know maybe that's the point none of this
[1:12:19.380 --> 1:12:22.700]  means the DOJ is going to stop prosecuting political dissidents however
[1:12:22.700 --> 1:12:27.260]  they're full speed ahead on that just today the DOJ the Biden administration
[1:12:27.260 --> 1:12:32.580]  announced is charging a host at info wars and they called Owen shroyer with
[1:12:32.580 --> 1:12:37.260]  several federal crimes including quote entering a restricted area on January 6
[1:12:37.260 --> 1:12:41.300]  well that sounds bad what did Owen shroyer do he didn't go inside the Capitol
[1:12:41.300 --> 1:12:45.060]  building in January 6th he stood on the Capitol steps with hundreds of other
[1:12:45.060 --> 1:12:50.940]  people he didn't even loot Macy's like black lives matter he just stood there
[1:12:50.940 --> 1:12:55.140]  on the Capitol steps a building he thought he owned as an American citizen
[1:12:55.140 --> 1:12:59.540]  what's going on here exactly well Owen shroyer's real crime appeared to have
[1:12:59.540 --> 1:13:04.340]  occurred in December of 2019 when he shouted mean things to Jerry Nadler
[1:13:04.340 --> 1:13:08.660]  during a congressional hearing the DOJ accused him of disorderly conduct and
[1:13:08.660 --> 1:13:11.860]  told him never go near the Capitol again you don't want to hurt Jerry Nadler's
[1:13:11.860 --> 1:13:18.700]  feelings he disobeyed now he's going to jail on Monday are you cool with this
[1:13:18.700 --> 1:13:21.780]  Dick Cheney's daughter is that all right with you is this the country you want to
[1:13:21.780 --> 1:13:26.260]  live in how about that Adam Kinzinger is this the democracy you fought for
[1:13:26.260 --> 1:13:31.740]  please so the ringleaders of the riots go free especially if they're working for
[1:13:31.740 --> 1:13:36.420]  the FBI but the people who offend Joe Biden's friends they're in jail and the
[1:13:36.420 --> 1:13:40.540]  left-burning down cities well they're mostly peaceful Owen what is this like
[1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:44.660]  for you to be witnessing all this happen you know the whole experience since
[1:13:44.660 --> 1:13:49.300]  January 6th has just been surreal overall and you know Alex we've always had a
[1:13:49.300 --> 1:13:53.140]  sense of urgency here at Info Wars I think that's what separates our news
[1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:57.540]  coverage and live transmissions and reports and exclusive report desperate
[1:13:57.540 --> 1:14:01.060]  Americans trying to save the country and and and you know so we've kind of seen
[1:14:01.060 --> 1:14:05.980]  this coming and then and then they ran the big lie of January 6th and the
[1:14:05.980 --> 1:14:11.020]  Nazi Reichstag style event 2021 and then we watch them round up political
[1:14:11.020 --> 1:14:15.460]  distance we watch the media push it they have I think now 600 political
[1:14:15.460 --> 1:14:18.980]  prisoners in DC and some and other many of what's just walked in with a flag
[1:14:18.980 --> 1:14:23.020]  and insult their environment we're talking about veterans we're talking
[1:14:23.020 --> 1:14:27.860]  about pastors we're talking about women you know and these are all innocent
[1:14:27.860 --> 1:14:33.020]  people and and and on it on their face innocent but even even more innocent
[1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:36.300]  when you look in comparison you know Alex I guess I should have been in DC at
[1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:41.340]  the Capitol in June of 2020 you know assaulting out police officers and
[1:14:41.340 --> 1:14:45.100]  damaging property attacking people breaking windows burning churches to the
[1:14:45.100 --> 1:14:48.900]  ground you know then I probably would have been okay and you know I sent some
[1:14:48.900 --> 1:14:52.980]  of the crew footage of just some of the violence from the inauguration in 2016
[1:14:52.980 --> 1:14:55.740]  we're going to be covering it tonight Sunday night live and it's the same
[1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:59.820]  thing and you these people at the time they're all on video they never got
[1:14:59.820 --> 1:15:03.060]  harassed by the FBI and and no we're gonna talk about this when couple they
[1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:05.860]  dropped almost all the charges from the billions of damage and murders and
[1:15:05.860 --> 1:15:12.380]  killing across the country people don't understand if you read the arrest warrant
[1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:16.740]  and then the charging paper it literally is like Looney Tunes lies saying he
[1:15:16.740 --> 1:15:21.140]  entered the Capitol he assaulted people he called for attacking the Capitol and
[1:15:21.140 --> 1:15:24.660]  then the videos they use as their evidence is him trying to stop people
[1:15:24.660 --> 1:15:29.140]  going in I mean I don't even know what the FBI is actually freaked me out I'm
[1:15:29.140 --> 1:15:33.980]  actually scared I mean I mean like why would these are crazy people I don't
[1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:37.620]  even know what to say at this point I mean I like their exhibits is you being
[1:15:37.620 --> 1:15:42.580]  good and then they lie like what is this I'm telling you it's the collapse of
[1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:46.460]  civilization it's not just the FBI everything's incompetent now that's what
[1:15:46.460 --> 1:15:51.620]  it is it's just incompetent lunatic asylum we are living in a lunatic asylum
[1:15:51.620 --> 1:15:58.620]  look at the fall of Afghanistan that's just crazy Gerald in South Carolina go
[1:15:58.620 --> 1:16:01.820]  ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker hey Alex welcome would like to
[1:16:01.820 --> 1:16:05.540]  say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[1:16:05.540 --> 1:16:08.860]  stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a
[1:16:08.860 --> 1:16:14.940]  year okay I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that
[1:16:14.940 --> 1:16:20.220]  will never go away living defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for
[1:16:20.220 --> 1:16:25.140]  two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back I wanted to just
[1:16:25.140 --> 1:16:30.100]  quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is Matthew
[1:16:30.100 --> 1:16:37.060]  24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and
[1:16:37.060 --> 1:16:42.460]  you shall be hated of all nations for my namesake and then shall many be
[1:16:42.460 --> 1:16:47.260]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another right where
[1:16:47.260 --> 1:16:50.980]  we're at brother and that's because God's name is on the founding of this
[1:16:50.980 --> 1:16:54.220]  country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[1:16:54.220 --> 1:16:59.220]  God created this country the best product I'm not supposed to be biased I'm

[1:18:56.940 --> 1:19:02.140]  for your support let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a
[1:19:02.140 --> 1:19:06.260]  science fiction movie set in the year 2020 where a world government's being
[1:19:06.260 --> 1:19:10.500]  established where members of Congress and former presidents are censored by
[1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:14.940]  big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood
[1:19:14.940 --> 1:19:21.180]  plots and prions all over your body that you're not allowed to fly on an airplane
[1:19:21.180 --> 1:19:26.420]  think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years ago tell
[1:19:26.420 --> 1:19:32.260]  just five years ago if somebody told you this would be happening but it is happening
[1:19:32.260 --> 1:19:36.380]  now and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine is a gene therapy and it
[1:19:36.380 --> 1:19:40.100]  doesn't really work she got to take it every few months and the people that
[1:19:40.100 --> 1:19:44.380]  have submitted say great I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and
[1:19:44.380 --> 1:19:48.020]  not get sick from COVID even though it gets you sick from COVID and now there's
[1:19:48.020 --> 1:19:51.660]  record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing the shedding of the
[1:19:51.660 --> 1:19:56.340]  virus and that's in mainline studies Bill Gates and Fauci did this need to go
[1:19:56.340 --> 1:19:59.100]  to prison for it right now
[1:19:59.620 --> 1:20:04.940]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:20:12.220 --> 1:20:22.260]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide
[1:20:22.260 --> 1:20:26.460]  it's Alex Jones
[1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:35.740]  well I got to say it there's a most valuable player in our team America
[1:20:35.740 --> 1:20:40.460]  against the globalists in the last three years it's Tucker Carlson and I say
[1:20:40.460 --> 1:20:43.780]  that with real pleasure I don't want to be the alpha dog of this fight he's slick
[1:20:43.780 --> 1:20:47.340]  he's smart he's getting better by the minute since he woke up and shipped to
[1:20:47.340 --> 1:20:51.540]  his paradigm he's absolutely gets it now he doesn't have to listen to me he
[1:20:51.540 --> 1:20:55.260]  sees it now and he got out there and exposed the criminal elements of the
[1:20:55.260 --> 1:20:59.420]  Southern Poverty Law Center FBI operation provocaturing through the groups he
[1:20:59.420 --> 1:21:02.900]  got it out there and then that did trigger the FBI to have to come out and
[1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:06.180]  then say okay it wasn't organized by these other patriotic groups because they
[1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:10.220]  want to kill the fake narrative that it was an organized event because they
[1:21:10.220 --> 1:21:14.060]  don't want to come out that I'm not exonerating even the FBI if everybody
[1:21:14.060 --> 1:21:17.100]  talked to the FBI all day like it's the only thing out there you've got the
[1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:20.380]  Southern Poverty Law Center the ADL the Democratic Party they wrote that big
[1:21:20.380 --> 1:21:24.060]  time magazine article saying how a secret cabal got together and won the
[1:21:24.060 --> 1:21:28.220]  election and they admit oh on January 6 we were ready and we stood down and then
[1:21:28.220 --> 1:21:31.140]  we knew what they would and then they sit in their people and so it was a
[1:21:31.140 --> 1:21:35.820]  consortium of leftist groups that did this and then they had the head of the
[1:21:35.820 --> 1:21:39.940]  FBI try to protect that and say don't look at it but that came out and so now
[1:21:39.940 --> 1:21:45.180]  there's Carlson seeing oh they're having to exonerate Stone and Jones and
[1:21:45.180 --> 1:21:48.700]  Trump because they know there's nothing there we wanted a 10-day peaceful
[1:21:48.700 --> 1:21:53.100]  investigation this is a great defeat of us to trick us to get a million people
[1:21:53.100 --> 1:21:56.820]  there and let them commandeer a small group to break in this was a major coup
[1:21:56.820 --> 1:22:00.580]  biggest defeat of my life this is the biggest of my life not something I
[1:22:00.580 --> 1:22:04.460]  cooked up like all these neurotic leftists keep saying so I mean I'm in
[1:22:04.460 --> 1:22:07.780]  the arena it's okay but I got my ass kicked that day that that day was the
[1:22:07.780 --> 1:22:13.060]  Super Bowl Super Bowls and yes yes I lost big time but it's okay because the
[1:22:13.060 --> 1:22:16.780]  games keep going baby and I know what happened now and we're winning this
[1:22:16.780 --> 1:22:20.780]  Super Bowl this is a big deal so you were just an order because that's
[1:22:20.780 --> 1:22:24.980]  embarrassing to just burn you and some little message hey we can get you next
[1:22:24.980 --> 1:22:28.340]  and now my family's being threatened I'm not at liberty to talk about at this
[1:22:28.340 --> 1:22:31.620]  point but they're letting us know hey we can get your family too and I'm not
[1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:36.140]  gonna go there yet but it's bad on well and think about you talk about if
[1:22:36.140 --> 1:22:40.820]  January 6th is the loss what was our goal the victory for us was having the
[1:22:40.820 --> 1:22:45.860]  investigation getting to look at all the techniques that were used to change the
[1:22:45.860 --> 1:22:50.980]  rules before the 2020 election because of as Tucker Carlson said the COVID but
[1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:55.380]  they had all other kinds of excuses and now if you read the Time Magazine
[1:22:55.380 --> 1:22:59.660]  article today with all the information that we have now you can almost reverse
[1:22:59.660 --> 1:23:03.700]  engineer exactly what they did because we know when they're double counting
[1:23:03.700 --> 1:23:07.500]  triple counting ballots in Fulton County Georgia that's Atlanta they sent out
[1:23:07.500 --> 1:23:12.580]  Zuckerberg's group with his billions of dollars to just see hmm okay what what
[1:23:12.580 --> 1:23:16.620]  areas have a higher margin of Democrat voters what areas are gonna have the
[1:23:16.620 --> 1:23:20.500]  highest margin for Biden and then you just triple count you know double count
[1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:24.340]  those areas and you know you're just oh they ran an actuary demographic
[1:23:24.340 --> 1:23:28.780]  analysis on record and said don't worry they look like a red mirage but we'll
[1:23:28.780 --> 1:23:32.740]  have the votes once the polls close I mean they even telegraphed it bragging
[1:23:32.740 --> 1:23:36.900]  about the censorship bragging about changing the rules bragging about the
[1:23:36.900 --> 1:23:39.460]  mail-in ballots I mean it couldn't be clear this article doesn't get enough
[1:23:39.460 --> 1:23:42.620]  attention put it back on screen that article on Time Magazine where they
[1:23:42.620 --> 1:23:46.740]  bragged how all the corporations and media with Republicans got together to
[1:23:46.740 --> 1:23:49.780]  screw over voters and how they went in and bought everybody off and took
[1:23:49.780 --> 1:23:54.180]  control of the machine I mean they admit their crime criminals love to brag see
[1:23:54.180 --> 1:23:57.700]  they think we're like scheming and stuff they're the one scheming yeah we're like
[1:23:57.700 --> 1:24:01.500]  on a rocket ship without a helmet or like a buckle or anything just like
[1:24:01.500 --> 1:24:05.980]  grabbing it for dear life over here but a victory for us on January 6th would have
[1:24:05.980 --> 1:24:09.980]  been having that investigation getting Congress that was the goal not having
[1:24:09.980 --> 1:24:15.860]  that fiasco and again for us to be on down there that day and and kind of
[1:24:15.860 --> 1:24:19.580]  witness it and in like as it was happening but we couldn't we tried to
[1:24:19.580 --> 1:24:23.220]  stop it was too late we have all the footage they lie about you I mean really
[1:24:23.220 --> 1:24:28.540]  it's a sick thing actually again like you were saying I mean to say whatever
[1:24:28.540 --> 1:24:32.700]  lie they want but then with the video evidence like when you have the exact
[1:24:32.700 --> 1:24:36.540]  video here's the video Troyer assaulting and breaking in the Capitol and then
[1:24:36.540 --> 1:24:39.340]  it's you standing behind me while I say don't invade the Capitol and the
[1:24:39.340 --> 1:24:44.580]  caption says Alex Jones tries to stop people entering Capitol and we have all
[1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:48.660]  the footage obviously and we never had to break through any barriers or they're
[1:24:48.660 --> 1:24:52.540]  never police trying to stop us we worked with the police we tried to talk to the
[1:24:52.540 --> 1:24:55.980]  police we tried to get the crowd and all that raw footage is on info wars.com
[1:24:55.980 --> 1:25:00.860]  that's right and I put up a video today which just the body cam footage
[1:25:00.860 --> 1:25:06.940]  compilation because yesterday we had launched a go fund or go fund me account

[1:26:32.340 --> 1:26:37.700]  thing but we want to just have a massive victory here and then we also want to
[1:26:37.700 --> 1:26:43.260]  think hey how do we how do we how do we take the legal system into our hands
[1:26:43.260 --> 1:26:46.780]  and say wait a second you're committing crimes you're lying about let's be clear
[1:26:46.780 --> 1:26:50.500]  we're not litigious but let's just say we are gonna file suit on having
[1:26:50.500 --> 1:26:55.940]  post and others because they say Owen let an attack on the Capitol and Owen
[1:26:55.940 --> 1:26:59.580]  supported the attack they just say that and that got picked up everywhere they
[1:26:59.580 --> 1:27:03.780]  just made that up and then and then what they'll do is what they always do they
[1:27:03.780 --> 1:27:07.540]  like to do this to you is they'll try to put clips together out of context and
[1:27:07.540 --> 1:27:11.340]  cut things up and edit them just deceptively to try to try to make a
[1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:14.740]  case against me because that's what these people do and so this is who I'm
[1:27:14.740 --> 1:27:19.220]  dealing with folks we are going toe-to-toe with the deep state as they say it
[1:27:19.220 --> 1:27:23.700]  and if you look at how liberals and Democrats and progressives are treated
[1:27:23.700 --> 1:27:26.540]  when they're in DC and they get arrested and they and they have to deal with
[1:27:26.540 --> 1:27:30.540]  police and then you look at how Republicans or conservatives or Trump
[1:27:30.540 --> 1:27:34.620]  supporters or Christians and Christians it's just it's not even close there's
[1:27:34.620 --> 1:27:39.140]  there's clear let's talk about this right now we were in the red most of this
[1:27:39.140 --> 1:27:44.540]  year and my pillow came along promo code Alex it's 66% off of that and then
[1:27:44.540 --> 1:27:48.540]  that got us a little bit out of the out of the red we're still not doing great

[1:30:07.980 --> 1:30:11.820]  injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic
[1:30:11.820 --> 1:30:16.300]  disease the perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having
[1:30:16.300 --> 1:30:21.100]  80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in

[1:30:38.980 --> 1:30:43.460]  when we win and we eventually will the days of convenience are soon coming to

[1:33:31.860 --> 1:33:36.180]  I was sure I was gonna be hosting from 6 to 8 p.m. tonight with of course the
[1:33:36.180 --> 1:33:40.620]  vaunted Sunday live it's only has six minutes of ads an hour those ads are
[1:33:40.620 --> 1:33:44.620]  only for the local stations we skip all of our ads and only have network ads for
[1:33:44.620 --> 1:33:48.580]  folks on Sunday live something I'm planning to do into the future here
[1:33:48.580 --> 1:33:51.540]  because I get talk radio is great it's been around for a long time it's safe
[1:33:51.540 --> 1:33:55.500]  free speech it's saved America I want to stay on talk radio but I do want to move
[1:33:55.500 --> 1:33:59.540]  more towards a podcast format where we don't have 14 minutes of ads an hour
[1:33:59.540 --> 1:34:03.620]  standard of talk radio so first place we're doing that is Sunday live I was
[1:34:03.620 --> 1:34:08.660]  shroyer 6 to 8 p.m. coming up this evening oh and I want to hit Apple's
[1:34:08.660 --> 1:34:11.500]  announcement they're gonna read everything on your phone and scan it we
[1:34:11.500 --> 1:34:14.100]  already knew what's happening they're just now announcing it so they want to
[1:34:14.100 --> 1:34:18.020]  fight pedophilia while they're actually involved in death camps suicide nets
[1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:22.420]  forced abortions pedophilia you name it I'm gonna tie that into the CIA I want to
[1:34:22.420 --> 1:34:28.380]  hit so much more and I'm not trying to go on some jag to attack Trump because
[1:34:28.380 --> 1:34:31.140]  I've already been persecuted for supporting Trump but I think Trump means
[1:34:31.140 --> 1:34:36.060]  well overall and it's a good guy but when it comes to him saying okay I want to
[1:34:36.060 --> 1:34:39.380]  restart the economy they say they got a vaccine it'll work I get he's not a
[1:34:39.380 --> 1:34:43.140]  scientist so we got lied to about that it wasn't really a vaccine it had problems
[1:34:43.140 --> 1:34:47.460]  we now know it's a scam but they're now admitting the Pfizer and Moderna are
[1:34:47.460 --> 1:34:51.420]  now the less than 40% efficacy even with their fake numbers so they're saying
[1:34:51.420 --> 1:34:55.260]  booster shot so Trump comes out on Fox and friends Thursday and says I don't
[1:34:55.260 --> 1:34:59.700]  trust this booster shot the head of Pfizer it'll make $10 billion oh they
[1:34:59.700 --> 1:35:03.900]  get that clip of the CEO of Pfizer ready saying he won't take the shot play that
[1:35:03.900 --> 1:35:09.740]  in a minute what do you make of that and then him echoing Biden's statements
[1:35:09.740 --> 1:35:14.340]  we've seen so many clips of saying take the shot you're protected from COVID no
[1:35:14.340 --> 1:35:18.820]  you're not so then here Trump at that rally in Alabama that that for me is
[1:35:18.820 --> 1:35:23.060]  crossing the Rubicon that's a little too much well I think that at its very
[1:35:23.060 --> 1:35:28.020]  lowest you know the very lowest of an issue here is Trump is now doing
[1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:32.900]  political speak he's speaking like a politician he's either going along with
[1:35:32.900 --> 1:35:38.060]  the vaccine at least rhetorically to try to bury any negative headlines about
[1:35:38.060 --> 1:35:41.340]  vaccines and Trump or you know it's his fault that people don't get vaccinated
[1:35:41.340 --> 1:35:46.260]  and die or something like that or he's wanting to cuddle up to the big
[1:35:46.260 --> 1:35:52.700]  pharmaceutical lobby for potential campaign donations or better coverage in
[1:35:52.700 --> 1:35:56.620]  the media pope well that's horrible that's the case yeah so it's if you know
[1:35:56.620 --> 1:36:00.140]  but that's Trump making a political move no I think it's I agree with the
[1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.620]  overall but I think it's him being pigheaded and saying I did to reopen
[1:36:03.620 --> 1:36:06.420]  things I'm the guy that launched the vaccine you're not gonna say it's bad
[1:36:06.420 --> 1:36:10.820]  it did work I see it as your pigheadedness hmm and and you know if
[1:36:10.820 --> 1:36:14.580]  it's an ego thing like that and a stubbornness thing like that maybe it's
[1:36:14.580 --> 1:36:17.260]  not so bad I don't know you could you could you know debate what would be
[1:36:17.260 --> 1:36:21.820]  worse Trump turning into a politician or Trump just being too egotistical to
[1:36:21.820 --> 1:36:26.140]  admit that he'd been fooled on something but what does it do to him just as you
[1:36:26.140 --> 1:36:29.220]  were saying during the break 80% of his base doesn't like it yeah highly
[1:36:29.220 --> 1:36:31.660]  educated liberals don't like it the higher educated you are the one you're
[1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:35.020]  gonna say guys cue that up again of Biden and then Trump because I'm saying
[1:36:35.020 --> 1:36:38.820]  we're gonna have a vote on info or here today or tomorrow for people what is
[1:36:38.820 --> 1:36:45.820]  Trump's new name is it try Biden try Biden is it brump bump or dump or do you
[1:36:45.820 --> 1:36:53.140]  have a name if you can buy Trump and and Biden is it by trumping or I mean what
[1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:57.660]  is it Trump Trump Trump Biden I don't know there's not really a good
[1:36:57.660 --> 1:37:02.500]  Biden for Biden well I mean at least he doesn't want to shut off our energy and
[1:37:02.500 --> 1:37:06.780]  do all that other stuff so when you make the comparison but I you know I don't
[1:37:06.780 --> 1:37:12.780]  understand how Trump couldn't go into his rally knowing that 80% of the people
[1:37:12.780 --> 1:37:16.420]  probably at that rally don't like the big vaccine maybe 50% I don't know what
[1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:20.820]  number but it's definitely 50% oh we're trying to save lives I'm trying to put
[1:37:20.820 --> 1:37:24.620]  pressure on him because I've been told by Tucker and others it's true even
[1:37:24.620 --> 1:37:27.740]  Rogers you say hey don't kiss Trump's ass those conversations you know push him
[1:37:27.740 --> 1:37:32.100]  around a little bit he'll he'll listen to you more if you're actually and that's
[1:37:32.100 --> 1:37:36.860]  actually true I would say push him around just you know don't be just like
[1:37:36.860 --> 1:37:41.380]  prostrating yourself before him and that's what I'm saying is this is bad we
[1:37:41.380 --> 1:37:45.340]  need him to extricate himself and go up her fountain gates well and I don't see
[1:37:45.340 --> 1:37:49.260]  he should have made the brilliant move that when it was presented to him when
[1:37:49.260 --> 1:37:53.260]  Biden and Kamala Harris start owning these vaccines after hating it you know
[1:37:53.260 --> 1:37:55.740]  when it was when he was one that actually launched the whole thing they
[1:37:55.740 --> 1:37:59.500]  hated it then then Biden takes office and it's the greatest thing ever they gave
[1:37:59.500 --> 1:38:03.980]  him a window of opportunity to step out of the pro vaccine stance they literally
[1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:08.260]  opened the door and said all right we'll take the entire heat of these vaccines
[1:38:08.260 --> 1:38:11.820]  killing people and giving people cancer and everything we'll take it all we'll
[1:38:11.820 --> 1:38:16.020]  own it all Trump had to do was let him do it and then kung fu him and he could
[1:38:16.020 --> 1:38:18.940]  have been like yeah you know what I was told this about the vaccine but now
[1:38:18.940 --> 1:38:21.820]  they're making it mandatory and people getting sick but then he comes out and
[1:38:21.820 --> 1:38:26.220]  says oh I took it it was it was a bad move for the rally I don't understand
[1:38:26.220 --> 1:38:30.460]  why he even included it well we just put the poll live it's already got a lot of
[1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:34.900]  votes what employers dot com the front page brunt what should the rhetorical
[1:38:34.900 --> 1:38:42.820]  merger of Trump and Biden be called true Biden bump brump or dump and even though
[1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:45.860]  dumps the joke on it has nothing to do with reality of the name of the combined
[1:38:45.860 --> 1:38:51.340]  people I think 60% I call the combination of Trump becoming Biden a dump I
[1:38:51.340 --> 1:38:56.660]  think it's dump I think I agree with dump because it is a dump it's a dump of
[1:38:56.660 --> 1:39:00.940]  communism it's a dump of America's energy it's a dump it's Trump going from a
[1:39:00.940 --> 1:39:06.660]  Trump to a dump well who knows I mean he seems to appear he's going to be
[1:39:06.660 --> 1:39:11.220]  running in 2024 he hasn't made an official announcement I don't think the
[1:39:11.220 --> 1:39:14.540]  Republican Party will scuttle him this time around like they did in 2016 he'll
[1:39:14.540 --> 1:39:19.580]  be too powerful look I like Trump and I want him to secure the borders and the
[1:39:19.580 --> 1:39:25.500]  crate energy I love all that but I mean why lie and say oh it totally works it
[1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:30.260]  doesn't work it's a fraud man and just admit they lied to you blame Fauci and

[1:39:34.420 --> 1:39:37.740]  had the perfect opportunity and then he starts bragging about his vaccine which
[1:39:37.740 --> 1:39:42.420]  who knows if he even got it and they just updated the bears numbers the other
[1:39:42.420 --> 1:39:47.540]  day and you know that the number for dead from vaccines in the year 2021 just
[1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:50.980]  continues to shatter it's more than all the previous years yeah we know a
[1:39:50.980 --> 1:39:54.020]  fraction get reported on and even that's a small percentage of the actual
[1:39:54.020 --> 1:39:57.220]  numbers that I mean conservatively it's probably four times that I'd say
[1:39:57.220 --> 1:40:01.620]  conservatively maybe ten times hey let's get here so I want to finish up on the
[1:40:01.620 --> 1:40:04.820]  other side with what's happening in Afghanistan and the giant pedophile

[1:42:14.020 --> 1:42:18.180]  going to the maximum craziness I'm surprised they don't say kill yourself so
[1:42:18.180 --> 1:42:20.860]  they don't spread COVID well that's coming next you know they just shot a
[1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:24.740]  bunch of dogs in Australia to stop COVID from spreading they didn't even have
[1:42:24.740 --> 1:42:29.220]  COVID to shot the dogs just shot them it's all about what can we do it was it
[1:42:29.220 --> 1:42:34.220]  was government safety dogs it was it was it was working dogs it's it really is
[1:42:34.220 --> 1:42:39.140]  like a class it's like a weird it's a it's a Milgram study or a Stanford
[1:42:39.140 --> 1:42:42.140]  Prison Research Facility study where they did they did where they would see
[1:42:42.140 --> 1:42:45.780]  what you could be able to do but I think it's like American psycho but it's like
[1:42:45.780 --> 1:42:50.420]  American psycho liberal and like but worldwide it's like see how far we can

[1:43:57.380 --> 1:44:02.260]  through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[1:44:02.260 --> 1:44:06.620]  we are told and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher
[1:44:06.620 --> 1:44:11.740]  senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too much
[1:44:11.740 --> 1:44:16.420]  fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its
[1:44:16.420 --> 1:44:21.060]  natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia the
[1:44:21.060 --> 1:44:24.820]  hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the
[1:44:24.820 --> 1:44:29.940]  pineal gland is the third eye also described as the seat of the soul the
[1:44:29.940 --> 1:44:34.180]  pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and
[1:44:34.180 --> 1:44:39.580]  otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to
[1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:44.460]  keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the
[1:44:44.460 --> 1:44:49.260]  proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the propure
[1:44:49.260 --> 1:44:54.820]  showerhead will seal the deal get them both today for yourself or a friend at
[1:44:54.820 --> 1:45:01.900]  infowarstore.com let's go back in time say to the mid 1990s and then imagine a
[1:45:01.900 --> 1:45:06.020]  science fiction movie set in the year 2020 or a world government's being
[1:45:06.020 --> 1:45:10.220]  established where members of Congress and former presidents are censured by
[1:45:10.220 --> 1:45:14.660]  big tech and where if you don't take an experimental injection that grows blood
[1:45:14.660 --> 1:45:20.460]  plots and prions all over your body then you're not allowed to fly on an
[1:45:20.460 --> 1:45:25.300]  airplane think about that because that's where we are imagine just 20 30 years
[1:45:25.300 --> 1:45:29.780]  ago tell just five years ago if somebody told you this would be happening
[1:45:29.780 --> 1:45:34.940]  but it is happening now and then they tell you oh sorry it's not a vaccine as
[1:45:34.940 --> 1:45:38.620]  a gene therapy and it doesn't really work she got to take it every few months
[1:45:38.620 --> 1:45:43.220]  and the people that have submitted say great I want to take it all the time so
[1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:46.460]  I can go outside and not get sick from COVID even though it gets you sick from
[1:45:46.460 --> 1:45:50.740]  COVID and now there's record numbers of really sick people from the sloughing
[1:45:50.740 --> 1:45:54.980]  the shedding of the virus and that's in mainline studies Bill Gates and Fauci
[1:45:54.980 --> 1:45:59.060]  did this need to go to prison for it right now so when I first started
[1:45:59.060 --> 1:46:03.140]  taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had
[1:46:03.140 --> 1:46:07.300]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I
[1:46:07.300 --> 1:46:10.500]  heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it so the first one I got
[1:46:10.500 --> 1:46:14.420]  was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good and then
[1:46:14.420 --> 1:46:17.340]  shortly thereafter you came out with that too you had you know with a deep
[1:46:17.340 --> 1:46:20.500]  burden source you know and I got really excited about that so I took it and man
[1:46:20.500 --> 1:46:25.700]  in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was
[1:46:25.700 --> 1:46:29.860]  enlightened you know I could think again I could connect with people again and
[1:46:29.860 --> 1:46:33.820]  over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I
[1:46:33.820 --> 1:46:36.700]  religiously take basically all of your supplements they're they're all
[1:46:36.700 --> 1:46:41.060]  absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently is knockout literally
[1:46:41.060 --> 1:46:44.580]  like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the
[1:46:44.580 --> 1:46:48.580]  point is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist
[1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:52.420]  system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[1:46:52.420 --> 1:47:00.220]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much for calling Godspeed you're
[1:47:00.220 --> 1:47:27.500]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:47:31.220 --> 1:47:38.740]  we are back live and if you're a new listener I've got clips so insane that
[1:47:38.740 --> 1:47:43.700]  I I say I have these clips that I feel like a liar even though I have the clips
[1:47:43.700 --> 1:47:47.860]  I mean I've been watching Australian TV I've been watching Spanish TV French TV
[1:47:47.860 --> 1:47:52.300]  UK TV and I got Paul Watson works with us over in the UK and he tells me it's
[1:47:52.300 --> 1:47:56.740]  worse than you see on TV I mean we're talking they'll run women over with
[1:47:56.740 --> 1:48:00.820]  horses if they try to go outside or whatever not wear a mask there they're
[1:48:00.820 --> 1:48:05.260]  there I mean you seen the footage it's just road warrior level this isn't some
[1:48:05.260 --> 1:48:10.660]  horror movie this is some dystopic movie this is happening this isn't songbird
[1:48:10.660 --> 1:48:13.940]  movie they put out six months ago about an endless lockdown this is really going
[1:48:13.940 --> 1:48:25.300]  on so when I say I have all this footage we've got footage of people in the UK
[1:48:25.300 --> 1:48:30.540]  people in Germany government ministers Canada Australia and New Zealand which
[1:48:30.540 --> 1:48:35.940]  shows it's all unified propaganda saying do not talk to your neighbor even over
[1:48:35.940 --> 1:48:40.820]  the fence do not look at people in the eye and now they've got billboards up in
[1:48:40.820 --> 1:48:45.460]  the UK and Australia saying don't look at people in the eye that is just pure
[1:48:45.460 --> 1:48:50.380]  crazy leftist behavioral psychology to see what you'll put up with they don't
[1:48:50.380 --> 1:48:53.660]  want you talking because you realize it's all a fraud not even 10 deaths this
[1:48:53.660 --> 1:48:59.100]  year in Australia from covered all just a giant insane exercise why what's
[1:48:59.100 --> 1:49:03.140]  coming to ask for hitting the world what's going on and then they you would
[1:49:03.140 --> 1:49:06.860]  admit oh Australia is the model the rest of the world building its emergency
[1:49:06.860 --> 1:49:09.740]  camps where they're not saying the unvaccinated will be forced into them
[1:49:09.740 --> 1:49:13.260]  and they're planning that in the future here because they're gonna have so many
[1:49:13.260 --> 1:49:16.820]  deaths from the variants from the vaccines that they're gonna say it's the
[1:49:16.820 --> 1:49:19.620]  unvaccinated are gonna cause the mask death we didn't have a bunch of extra
[1:49:19.620 --> 1:49:22.660]  deaths last year same number of deaths last year as we had the previous year
[1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:26.300]  first time in many years the numbers take the same year to year because the
[1:49:26.300 --> 1:49:31.380]  population is increasing because of immigration migration invasion but this
[1:49:31.380 --> 1:49:35.060]  year I told you two three months ago I said the real illness is here it's
[1:49:35.060 --> 1:49:38.940]  exploding people are really sick whatever it is and now you see the graphs
[1:49:38.940 --> 1:49:45.660]  I'm correct I don't need graphs I talk to people I see things so this is all a
[1:49:45.660 --> 1:49:49.500]  giant globalist exercise of power and next hour I'm gonna co-host for 20
[1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:53.780]  minutes or so the next hour with oh and then he takes over I'm gonna read you
[1:49:53.780 --> 1:49:57.580]  some of Klaus Schwab's admissions about how he's doing this now it's all an
[1:49:57.580 --> 1:50:02.780]  exercise of power to quote end the power of the people I'm gonna show you from
[1:50:02.780 --> 1:50:07.740]  Wikipedia and then links to his own statements where he says his job is
[1:50:07.740 --> 1:50:13.140]  making sure you have no power then he says you'll have nothing and you'll own
[1:50:13.140 --> 1:50:17.500]  nothing we have his official videos he put out saying that people go what you
[1:50:17.500 --> 1:50:20.900]  will not ever have me again you won't be able to have children it's good he's
[1:50:20.900 --> 1:50:26.660]  gaslighting you and his minions now are saying don't look at the Sun because
[1:50:26.660 --> 1:50:29.620]  they've had people they catch out in their backyard they go oh you're not
[1:50:29.620 --> 1:50:34.140]  allowed to have Sun go in your house it's it's always more more you're like I
[1:50:34.140 --> 1:50:39.060]  mean Jim Jones wasn't this bad so play the clip of the Australian Health
[1:50:39.060 --> 1:50:43.340]  Minister saying don't look at the Sun and then we've got also in Australia the
[1:50:43.340 --> 1:50:46.360]  national government saying do not talk to your neighbors the National Health
[1:50:46.360 --> 1:50:50.420]  Minister and I had a whole bunch of people down the
[1:50:50.420 --> 1:50:53.020]  right back piece last night who thought the best thing to do is to go and watch
[1:50:53.020 --> 1:50:58.100]  the sunset I'm sure it was a beautiful sunset that's not in the spirit or in
[1:50:58.100 --> 1:51:06.060]  or in the letter of these rules whilst it isn't human nature to engage in
[1:51:06.060 --> 1:51:13.140]  conversation with others to be friendly unfortunately this is not the time to do
[1:51:13.140 --> 1:51:18.460]  that so even if you run into your next door neighbor in the shopping centre in
[1:51:18.460 --> 1:51:25.020]  the Coles washer at Coles Wars or Aldi or any other grocery shop don't start up a
[1:51:25.020 --> 1:51:29.740]  conversation now is the time for minimizing your interactions with others
[1:51:29.740 --> 1:51:35.580]  even if you've got a mask do not think that affords total protection we want
[1:51:35.580 --> 1:51:40.420]  to be absolutely sure that as we go about our daily lives we do not come
[1:51:40.420 --> 1:51:44.220]  into contact with anyone else that would pose a mean law they've got articles
[1:51:44.220 --> 1:51:48.820]  in Australia confirming thousand percent more people committed suicide than have
[1:51:48.820 --> 1:51:55.020]  died of COVID conservatively local and do not congregate don't talk to your
[1:51:55.020 --> 1:52:01.020]  neighbors please keep to your bubbles it comes down again to those very simple
[1:52:01.020 --> 1:52:07.740]  principles we know from overseas cases of the Delta pause this is the cult leader
[1:52:07.740 --> 1:52:13.740]  globalist that runs New Zealand who lets the special blue pass they also have
[1:52:13.740 --> 1:52:18.220]  in Fiji where the elites can fly on private jets no one checks them no one
[1:52:18.220 --> 1:52:21.300]  questions they all know it's a fraud the airports are closed no one can come in
[1:52:21.300 --> 1:52:24.860]  about Australia or New Zealand but if you're part of the special secret blue
[1:52:24.860 --> 1:52:30.180]  lane pass that almost no one knows about you fly in no one's there no one
[1:52:30.180 --> 1:52:34.180]  questions no guards check you you you don't wear it you drive around in your
[1:52:34.180 --> 1:52:39.980]  limo and everyone bows to you so think of the level of that here is the Prime
[1:52:39.980 --> 1:52:44.260]  Minister of New Zealand again as a total cult leader stay in your bubbles
[1:52:44.260 --> 1:52:47.740]  where big tech and the globalist can program you and prepare you for what's
[1:52:47.740 --> 1:52:51.580]  next signing you up for the digital IDs injecting you with a sterile it's here
[1:52:51.580 --> 1:52:58.420]  it is stay local and do not congregate don't talk to your neighbors please keep
[1:52:58.420 --> 1:53:04.380]  to your bubbles it comes down again to those very simple principles we know
[1:53:04.380 --> 1:53:09.660]  from overseas cases of the Delta variant that it can be spread by people
[1:53:09.660 --> 1:53:14.100]  simply walking past one another so keep those movements outside to the bare
[1:53:14.100 --> 1:53:19.380]  minimum wear a mask and make sure you keep up that physical distancing what a
[1:53:19.380 --> 1:53:23.860]  cult of sickos I mean I mean Owen that's in operation locks kept they said
[1:53:23.860 --> 1:53:28.460]  corporations should use the fear of a virus and the fear with masks and all
[1:53:28.460 --> 1:53:32.180]  this to bring in fear and bring in a global ID and the Schwab Braggs I'll
[1:53:32.180 --> 1:53:36.100]  show it next hour and admits it's all just a pretext he says this is a pretext
[1:53:36.100 --> 1:53:40.860]  to get what I want tell me you're Satan without telling me you're Satan why do
[1:53:40.860 --> 1:53:45.020]  you think he brags about it so much why does he say that don't watch this sunset
[1:53:45.020 --> 1:53:48.500]  you can go to the world economics on page Alex they brag they say you're not
[1:53:48.500 --> 1:53:51.260]  gonna own anything you won't own any property you won't eat meat you'll
[1:53:51.260 --> 1:53:54.820]  let you live in a little pod you know you'll get your your little side your
[1:53:54.820 --> 1:53:58.580]  little tiny amount of energy every day your little calorie bar every day and
[1:53:58.580 --> 1:54:01.420]  maybe you'll get a little light maybe you'll get a little electricity and you
[1:54:01.420 --> 1:54:05.100]  can know or maybe some Netflix maybe you sign on and sterilize your children and
[1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:10.620]  so the whole point is to collapse the world down into a prison state and then
[1:54:10.620 --> 1:54:15.900]  say oh we're gonna free you but you just have to live in our stuff because we
[1:54:15.900 --> 1:54:20.660]  now own everything and it came out that the top financial advisor at BlackRock
[1:54:20.660 --> 1:54:26.780]  is actually a Chinese woman and she is now encouraging BlackRock to divest all
[1:54:26.780 --> 1:54:32.460]  of its financial holdings into China as they're buying up all the property here
[1:54:32.460 --> 1:54:36.100]  in America so so now that the Democrats have made it so that you don't even have
[1:54:36.100 --> 1:54:39.820]  to pay rent all the landlords are going out of business so so now it's not just
[1:54:39.820 --> 1:54:43.740]  BlackRock buying up all these major neighborhoods and suburban areas just
[1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:46.460]  anyhow so they can pick up off the market oh now they're gonna get the
[1:54:46.460 --> 1:54:49.820]  apartment complexes and condominium complexes and now they're gonna own
[1:54:49.820 --> 1:54:53.980]  everything see and everybody sits there oh I get Netflix oh I got this free for
[1:54:53.980 --> 1:54:57.620]  a few more months when in the future there'll be no job nothing in China owns
[1:54:57.620 --> 1:55:03.420]  at all and that is the entire purpose of why Klaus Schwab I guess is the
[1:55:03.420 --> 1:55:07.260]  spokesman because you know they got to have a nice guy who's bald and he could
[1:55:07.260 --> 1:55:11.660]  speak English to tell the good Americans that you will be slaves but you will
[1:55:11.660 --> 1:55:14.700]  like that's a great point remember four years ago when Trump was in for about
[1:55:14.700 --> 1:55:18.620]  six months they had the Davos group and then was that headline the Washington
[1:55:18.620 --> 1:55:24.540]  Post everywhere and they said GG Ping will defeat Trump with the Davos group
[1:55:24.540 --> 1:55:27.860]  and there was like Klaus Schwab saying we will defeat Trump in America we would
[1:55:27.860 --> 1:55:32.500]  use economic power they will see and other surprises and then even Fauci said
[1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:36.980]  the next month oh we've got a novel virus for Trump he's done I mean this they
[1:55:36.980 --> 1:55:40.900]  even that's the thing we live this oh and I we were here all the time we watch
[1:55:40.900 --> 1:55:45.500]  these enemies we study them and they're just out in the open what's crazy is
[1:55:45.500 --> 1:55:48.980]  Owen I don't know when you get out of jail you you deliver yourself to the
[1:55:48.980 --> 1:55:53.420]  federal courthouse in downtown Austin tomorrow morning and just disappear to
[1:55:53.420 --> 1:55:57.740]  some black hole and you're like well America's still America no the arrest
[1:55:57.740 --> 1:56:00.860]  warrant says you attacked and entered the Capitol when you didn't I mean it's
[1:56:00.860 --> 1:56:05.780]  like like like like it's just it's frightening how criminal the system is
[1:56:05.780 --> 1:56:10.420]  when an innocent man you know when an innocent man is persecuted and goes to
[1:56:10.420 --> 1:56:13.780]  jail justice suffers and that's what's going on in this country right now well
[1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:18.100]  it's better that a thousand guilty men go free than when this may go to jail but
[1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:22.780]  I mean why again why would they put in the exhibits video of you doing nothing
[1:56:22.780 --> 1:56:26.300]  outside trying to stop saying don't go into the building how would they use that
[1:56:26.300 --> 1:56:30.340]  as evidence you assaulted the building but why I don't even get it I mean they
[1:56:30.340 --> 1:56:34.300]  put a red circle over my head so maybe that's it oh there's a red circle over
[1:56:34.300 --> 1:56:38.500]  his head it's red too so that's that must be bad because it's red and so there

[1:58:12.020 --> 1:58:16.580]  considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe the Samoan

[1:58:51.500 --> 1:58:55.500]  welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and
[1:58:55.500 --> 1:58:59.100]  amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold
[1:58:59.100 --> 1:59:05.060]  of you for a year okay I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on
[1:59:05.060 --> 1:59:09.580]  my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my life they had me on
[1:59:09.580 --> 1:59:14.260]  antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[1:59:14.260 --> 1:59:19.620]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right
[1:59:19.620 --> 1:59:26.300]  now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and
[1:59:26.300 --> 1:59:32.180]  shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my namesake and then
[1:59:32.180 --> 1:59:37.100]  shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[1:59:37.100 --> 1:59:41.180]  that's right where we're at brother and that's because God's name is on the
[1:59:41.180 --> 1:59:44.500]  founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates
[1:59:44.500 --> 1:59:48.460]  it because God created this country
[1:59:48.460 --> 2:00:02.500]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
