[00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:09.790]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.931]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:17.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.192]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:38.239]  Hello my friends, hello and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.480]  Already Wednesday, the seventh day of January 2009.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.362]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:56.463]  And coming up, we've got Eric Plumlee, attorney on cell phone surveillance.
[00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:05.550]  In the United States and worldwide, how they're listening to you, how they're tracking you, how it's designed.
[00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:13.036]  Even when the phone is turned off, if they listen to you, by law the phone is designed to not just track your location, but audibly listen to you.
[00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:16.399]  I told you this back in 1996.
[00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.784]  Now the public is basically becoming aware of it, so we'll go ahead and cover it.
[00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:25.908]  Also, Ray McGovern, former top CIA analyst to George Bush Sr.
[00:01:28.243 --> 00:01:37.230]  And of course, Ronald Reagan getting into the Gaza situation and his analysis of what's coming up in the next year from his perspective.
[00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.113]  He was the morning briefer again to two presidents.
[00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:44.596]  And then we've got Barry Cooper, NeverGetBusted.com, cop busters.
[00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:58.571]  He's part of the organization of former narcotics officers that are against drug prohibition and expose the fact that it gets cops killed, citizens enslaved, and only increases the amount of drugs on our streets.
[00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:01.233]  And he's been busting cops trying to set people up.
[00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:19.916]  So that is certainly exciting because there are tens of thousands of officers that are members of this group and several other groups and they are aggressively, well they just caught a bunch of police in Florida not allowing people to file complaints on police and the police will start shoving on you, hitting on you.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.601]  This guy's a retired police officer.
[00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:30.145]  They threw him through a plate glass window at the police station for just saying, look, you need to give me the complaint form.
[00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:32.947]  And the complaint form itself goes in the trash can later.
[00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:37.010]  But they won't even give you that much respect to give you the thing they throw in the trash can.
[00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.892]  They just throw it through the plate glass window.
[00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:47.256]  But there are a lot of police who aren't evil and aren't arrogant and aren't thugs and they're leaving the force and investigating and tracking police.
[00:02:47.256 --> 00:02:48.677]  And winning a lot of big lawsuits as well.
[00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.891]  I certainly love that.
[00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:59.115]  The establishment ships in drugs, sells them to us, then goes out and busts people that use them to fund their criminal operation.
[00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:08.881]  If the patriots can fund our operations by suing these criminals and bringing them to justice, all the more pleasing.
[00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:13.523]  And if you're not a bad cop, and you're not violating the Bill of Rights Constitution, you don't have anything to worry about, do you?
[00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:17.005]  You're not breaking the law, and you don't have nothing to worry about, do you?
[00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:17.826]  That's right, you don't.
[00:03:19.684 --> 00:03:21.425]  And that brings me to San Francisco.
[00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:31.134]  I'm going to get into this later in the broadcast once we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv because I want to show the clips.
[00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:39.080]  The witnesses were all saying that they took the black men off the train.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.505]  There had been a report of people yelling and screaming at each other and arguing on the train.
[00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:46.907]  And that they then were putting them in handcuffs
[00:03:49.014 --> 00:03:53.618]  And that the man wasn't resisting and that they shot him in the back.
[00:03:53.618 --> 00:03:57.481]  And the police, and we have their first press conference, said, no, that's not true.
[00:03:57.481 --> 00:04:07.510]  And then they used this weird lawyer speak to say, there was a altercation, an argument,
[00:04:10.137 --> 00:04:13.139]  And then the officers, one of the officers shot him.
[00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:33.570]  Now, with legalese speak, he's talking about the argument on the train between the men that had the police respond, but psychologically, and they do this on the news too, in the newscast later, they're sandwiching that in with, oh, he did something, an altercation with police.
[00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.231]  And they lie.
[00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:37.352]  Well, they also confiscated surveillance.
[00:04:38.427 --> 00:04:49.223]  Not surveillance tapes, tapes that citizens shot, but that didn't stop people on another train that was stopped videoing it, and so the videos have been released showing the police live.
[00:04:50.285 --> 00:04:51.806]  And that's the issue.
[00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:54.649]  And folks, he just executes this guy.
[00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:58.552]  The guy is not resisting, nothing, they're beating him up for fun.
[00:04:58.552 --> 00:05:01.194]  And they just got into such a frenzy, they just kill him.
[00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:02.875]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:05.857]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient.
[00:05:05.857 --> 00:05:07.639]  And today, that's more important than ever.
[00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:08.820]  We need to be independent.
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.581]  And food and water is the key.
[00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:13.644]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:05:13.644 --> 00:05:15.125]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome.
[00:05:15.325 --> 00:05:19.748]  And begged for FEMA to take care of your family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[00:05:19.748 --> 00:05:25.551]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:27.392]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[00:05:27.392 --> 00:05:29.253]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[00:05:31.354 --> 00:05:34.156]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:43.302]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:50.407]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:52.408]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:54.849]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.530]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.771]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.132]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:08.952]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:13.013]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[00:06:13.013 --> 00:06:15.454]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared.
[00:06:15.454 --> 00:06:16.294]  Get self-sufficient.
[00:06:16.474 --> 00:06:17.155]  Get food.
[00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:24.683]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:25.884]  And so it's a mindset.
[00:06:25.884 --> 00:06:28.627]  A mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[00:06:28.627 --> 00:06:31.870]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.737]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:42.119]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:47.261]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:53.525]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, pre-scribed and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[00:06:53.525 --> 00:06:57.307]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:57.307 --> 00:06:58.647]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:06:58.647 --> 00:06:59.268]  Take action today.
[00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:01.108]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:07:09.588 --> 00:07:10.849]  Boosh!
[00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:14.312]  Number three, put your money where your something is, Gate.
[00:07:14.312 --> 00:07:21.338]  The Washington Post reporting that lame-duck Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne has left a present for his designated successor, Ken Salazar.
[00:07:21.338 --> 00:07:26.203]  $235,000 in upgrades to their office bathroom.
[00:07:26.203 --> 00:07:34.370]  A new shower, monogrammed towels, new tile, new plumbing, and lavish floor-to-ceiling wood paneling, which opens to reveal a refrigerator and a freezer.
[00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:40.400]  In the bathroom of the Office of the Secretary of the Interior, who apparently likes to freeze stuff in there.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.341]  Number two, Chutzpah Gates.
[00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:50.886]  John Bolton and John Yoo, two of the architects of Mr. Bush's foreign policy of shoot first, ask question second, mention it to Congress last.
[00:07:50.886 --> 00:07:55.288]  They have written an op-ed for the New York Times titled, Restore the Senate's Treaty Power.
[00:07:55.288 --> 00:08:02.352]  They are arguing that now the Senate needs to reassert its right to slam the brakes on unilateral international actions by the President.
[00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:08.756]  They're concerned that Obama may go for a Kyoto-style climate accord without Senate ratification.
[00:08:09.662 --> 00:08:15.885]  Bombing the hell out of the closest thing to an innocent bystander nation and getting 4,000 of our troops killed without Senate consent, that's fine.
[00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:20.807]  Try to save the atmosphere and suddenly John freakin' Bolton is demanding checks and balances.
[00:08:20.807 --> 00:08:23.068]  To Mr. Yu and to Mr. Bolton, this question.
[00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:26.290]  Do you take your hypocrisy orally or intravenously?
[00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:29.709]  And number one, crazy Vice President Gate.
[00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.671]  We continue to race the clock.
[00:08:31.671 --> 00:08:35.615]  Will Mr. Cheney somehow manage to destroy the planet in the next two weeks?
[00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:48.807]  On Face the Nation, he not only insisted that the economic collapse consisted of, quote, difficulties that have developed in the financial markets over the last six months, but when asked by Bob Schieffer if we're better off than we were eight years ago, he replied,
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.145]  I think we've done some very good things over the course of the last eight years.
[00:08:55.145 --> 00:09:01.171]  Defending the country against further terrorist attacks like 9-11 I think is a major accomplishment for example.
[00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:09.399]  Gets worse, our task when we came in was ultimately to deal with the aftermath of 9-11 and we had to take on the global war on terror.
[00:09:10.396 --> 00:09:17.661]  Listen, you fatuous, condescending lunatic, for the last time, your task was not to deal with the aftermath of 9-11, it was to prevent 9-11.
[00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:27.567]  And if you utterly whiffed on the most important test of all the presidencies in your lifetime, Mr. Cheney, you do not get credit for getting a C on the pop quizzes that followed.
[00:09:40.686 --> 00:09:44.209]  A new world order.
[00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:45.309]  A new world order.
[00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:50.993]  Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective.
[00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:52.694]  A new world order.
[00:09:52.694 --> 00:10:00.080]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:16.041]  Alright folks, thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:24.063]  It is Wednesday, the 7th of January, 2009.
[00:10:24.063 --> 00:10:43.448]  I, uh, spent about an hour and a half late last night of time I didn't have
[00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:58.754]  To really investigate this shooting that took place by the transit train police, the subway police, out in California.
[00:10:58.754 --> 00:11:09.218]  You know, this happened last Friday, and I didn't comment on it Sunday, I didn't comment on it Tuesday, because I hadn't had time to go research it and look at it.
[00:11:09.938 --> 00:11:18.225]  And I don't just sit here waiting feverishly to go after the police and bash the culture and bash their training.
[00:11:18.225 --> 00:11:20.547]  I have to, people are saying, why aren't you commenting on this?
[00:11:20.547 --> 00:11:22.008]  Why aren't you discussing this?
[00:11:22.008 --> 00:11:26.632]  Well, the videos hadn't leaked out yet.
[00:11:26.632 --> 00:11:33.318]  And every few days I see a report, we've had a few here in Austin where the police shoot someone in the back.
[00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.400]  Someone in handcuffs or someone restrained.
[00:11:38.437 --> 00:11:48.241]  And I don't even particularly at nausea bash the police for that, because I have to go study each case and spend time on it before I'm going to say anything about it.
[00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:51.742]  Well, I did spend a lot of time, an hour and a half.
[00:11:51.742 --> 00:11:57.024]  I went back and read all the original articles put out Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[00:11:57.024 --> 00:12:01.726]  I went and watched the different press conferences by the police.
[00:12:01.726 --> 00:12:04.527]  And then now, how do I put on the case here on air?
[00:12:08.058 --> 00:12:10.059]  How do I go over all the evidence?
[00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:11.680]  How do I cover all the different facets?
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.082]  I mean, number one, the police lied and said he wasn't restrained.
[00:12:16.082 --> 00:12:20.304]  They lied and implied that he was scuffling with them or arguing with them.
[00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:22.305]  There was a confrontation.
[00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:23.826]  They seized two video
[00:12:25.546 --> 00:12:29.730]  Recordings that were shot on cell phones by people on the platform that they saw.
[00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.411]  They told everybody, stay here.
[00:12:31.411 --> 00:12:33.773]  Pulled their guns out on them and confiscated their video.
[00:12:33.773 --> 00:12:35.835]  And then the police said, we don't know.
[00:12:35.835 --> 00:12:38.217]  Our video cameras weren't recording.
[00:12:38.217 --> 00:12:44.342]  The video camera surveillance system in that particular train stop just happened to not be recording that day.
[00:12:44.342 --> 00:12:47.805]  Then they said, oh, that system wasn't recording, period.
[00:12:47.805 --> 00:12:51.048]  It wasn't hooked up to a recording system like all the other bus stops.
[00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:58.658]  But there was no discussion of the fact that they'd seized the two videos shot by people on cell phones.
[00:12:58.658 --> 00:12:59.859]  Well, guess what happened?
[00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:06.224]  Another train was pulling up and stopping as the police were roughing up the young black men.
[00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:08.666]  And some people said, oh, we got the police roughing folks up.
[00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:13.870]  Let's go ahead and videotape that.
[00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.592]  And so they got their cameras rolling, they got their cell phones rolling.
[00:13:18.044 --> 00:13:25.270]  And then it took a few days for people to contact the media, but those videos are now out.
[00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.893]  Started coming out, what, Monday night.
[00:13:27.893 --> 00:13:30.655]  I didn't see them until yesterday.
[00:13:30.655 --> 00:13:36.600]  And sure enough, it's not even the issue that they murder this guy.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.865]  It's that they make excuses now that the videos have come out and are saying, well, he thought it was his taser.
[00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.651]  It was taser confusion.
[00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:45.911]  May have been.
[00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:48.512]  The issue here, though, is that they lied.
[00:13:48.512 --> 00:13:56.276]  The police officials with the Transit Authority lied about it.
[00:13:56.276 --> 00:13:59.437]  They need to go to jail.
[00:13:59.437 --> 00:14:07.441]  I'm not even so much focused on the police officer, clearly in a frenzy, who pulls his gun out
[00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:10.804]  Aims at the man's back and kills him.
[00:14:10.804 --> 00:14:18.870]  Because you can see the police officer's response, where he drops his hand with a gun and starts cussing, going, what the hell?
[00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.811]  What the hell just happened?
[00:14:20.811 --> 00:14:24.414]  I believe he probably did think it was his taser.
[00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.890]  I'm trying to be fair here.
[00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:34.552]  I don't, because I quote, hate cops, just then go, no, he clearly killed him in cold blood and meant to do it.
[00:14:34.552 --> 00:14:35.852]  That could be the case.
[00:14:35.852 --> 00:14:37.292]  We don't know.
[00:14:37.292 --> 00:14:45.334]  But the way he reacted after he killed the guy, after he shot the poor man, who did nothing wrong, looks like he was shocked.
[00:14:45.334 --> 00:14:45.954]  Doesn't matter.
[00:14:45.954 --> 00:14:47.615]  You still need to go to jail for manslaughter.
[00:14:47.615 --> 00:14:49.655]  You need to spend a few years in prison.
[00:14:53.206 --> 00:14:54.047]  You killed somebody.
[00:14:54.047 --> 00:14:54.867]  Their life is over.
[00:14:54.867 --> 00:14:58.531]  They did nothing wrong.
[00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:02.674]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:15:02.674 --> 00:15:18.648]  Coming up later, when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv at 1 o'clock central in an hour and 45 minutes, I'm going to open up that first 30 minutes before Ray McGovern joins us to cover what's happening in Gaza.
[00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:25.986]  And we're going to play some of these videos for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:27.988]  I'll describe them for the radio audience.
[00:15:27.988 --> 00:15:31.891]  They're all linked up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and we'll break this down.
[00:15:31.891 --> 00:15:40.198]  But the issue is, studying police agencies, they lie more often than they tell the truth.
[00:15:40.198 --> 00:15:43.300]  In fact, sometimes even when the truth suits them, they lie.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.603]  It is a culture of lying and deceit, and I'm tired of it.
[00:15:49.252 --> 00:16:00.921]  I saw this culture a year and a half ago when we were out when the governor had illegally gone to the Bilderberg Conference in violation of the Logan Act.
[00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:05.245]  Rick Perry, governor of Texas.
[00:16:05.245 --> 00:16:07.146]  He'd gone to Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:16:07.146 --> 00:16:13.631]  And we went out and we were protesting him at a function he was at, about 150 of us, peacefully on the sidewalk, not blocking any roads.
[00:16:13.631 --> 00:16:15.152]  And the Austin commander comes over.
[00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:22.909]  The first commander that showed up, they had riot police, you know, massing across the street, down the street, in a parking lot.
[00:16:22.909 --> 00:16:27.751]  And he said, listen, if you don't leave in five minutes, I'm going to have you arrested.
[00:16:27.751 --> 00:16:29.312]  And this is on camera.
[00:16:29.312 --> 00:16:30.272]  We have a camera right there.
[00:16:30.272 --> 00:16:32.734]  Even though he comes up and tries to whisper it.
[00:16:32.734 --> 00:16:33.774]  And I say, you're going to arrest me?
[00:16:33.774 --> 00:16:35.735]  And he goes, yes.
[00:16:35.735 --> 00:16:38.336]  I kind of bucked up a little bit just to get him to talk louder.
[00:16:38.336 --> 00:16:40.697]  Because I knew the camera was about five feet away.
[00:16:40.697 --> 00:16:41.378]  And he says, yes.
[00:16:41.378 --> 00:16:41.978]  And I said, hmm.
[00:16:43.536 --> 00:16:49.302]  Then there was a local magazine reporter there, and I went over and said, he just threatened to arrest us if we don't leave.
[00:16:49.302 --> 00:16:51.745]  And the reporter goes, oh, that's not true, Alex.
[00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:53.607]  Come on.
[00:16:53.607 --> 00:16:56.530]  And he goes over to the cop and goes, did you just threaten to arrest everybody if we don't leave?
[00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.771]  And he goes, nope, I didn't.
[00:16:57.771 --> 00:16:59.593]  Alex is lying.
[00:16:59.593 --> 00:17:00.755]  Well, then I really did blow up.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:07.144]  And then another commander, his boss, shows up and comes over and tells me, you know, what are you doing here?
[00:17:07.144 --> 00:17:07.764]  You need to go.
[00:17:07.764 --> 00:17:12.187]  And I said, look, he just lied and said he didn't say he was going to have us all arrested.
[00:17:12.187 --> 00:17:16.110]  The Austin Police Department's already lost a bunch of lawsuits over this.
[00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.151]  I have a First Amendment right.
[00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:18.472]  I don't have to have a permit to be here.
[00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:22.595]  I'm not blocking roads.
[00:17:22.595 --> 00:17:27.618]  And I said, go ahead, but I'm going to sue the commanders that give these orders.
[00:17:27.618 --> 00:17:29.660]  And you can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[00:17:31.189 --> 00:17:34.370]  And they got so mad and backed off.
[00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.690]  Why?
[00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.611]  Why did you get mad?
[00:17:35.611 --> 00:17:41.133]  I'm there defending your birthright, your children's birthright, the First Amendment.
[00:17:41.133 --> 00:17:48.936]  If I want to bullhorn Rick Perry for committing a federal offense, I'm going to do it, pal.
[00:17:48.936 --> 00:17:49.837]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:17:49.837 --> 00:17:56.739]  And it's not because I particularly even want to get in your face.
[00:17:56.739 --> 00:17:57.920]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.122]  I'm looking for liberty.
[00:18:00.122 --> 00:18:01.563]  I'm looking for my God-given rights.
[00:18:01.563 --> 00:18:02.963]  I'm looking for freedom.
[00:18:02.963 --> 00:18:08.387]  And I'm here to defend it and I'm here to exercise it and set the precedent.
[00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:09.888]  I haven't counted up all the lawsuits.
[00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:16.172]  I know it's over 50 plus that I've seen.
[00:18:16.172 --> 00:18:19.174]  There was one group of more than 20 lawsuits they lost in one bundle.
[00:18:21.638 --> 00:18:23.699]  And the state police have lost lawsuits right here in Austin.
[00:18:23.699 --> 00:18:26.501]  They've lost lawsuits in Dallas for coming up.
[00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:30.183]  The first big cases were what, back in 2000 they lost.
[00:18:30.183 --> 00:18:42.832]  Because if you tried to even hand out pamphlets or even shout on the street corner anywhere around the governor's mansion, the Austin PD and the state police would show up and say, you can't be here without a permit, we're arresting you.
[00:18:42.832 --> 00:18:47.114]  And they arrested a group out there protesting for disabled rights.
[00:18:47.114 --> 00:18:49.296]  A bunch of people in wheelchairs.
[00:18:49.296 --> 00:18:50.957]  And they all lost lawsuits over that.
[00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:54.214]  So I'm already digressing.
[00:18:54.214 --> 00:18:57.600]  A bunch of news coming up.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.325]  The Trans-Texas Corridor is not dead.
[00:19:00.325 --> 00:19:03.410]  And people are questioning me whether that's true or not.
[00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.291]  We'll break that down.
[00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:05.193]  We've got a bunch of other news.
[00:19:05.193 --> 00:19:05.554]  Stay with us.
[00:19:08.988 --> 00:19:12.510]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.

[00:20:05.783 --> 00:20:08.984]  Be a part of the revolution today.
[00:20:08.984 --> 00:20:15.726]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:20:15.726 --> 00:20:17.387]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:20:18.362 --> 00:20:19.923]  But who is the enemy?
[00:20:19.923 --> 00:20:20.724]  Bin Laden.
[00:20:20.724 --> 00:20:21.705]  This is his ammo.
[00:20:21.705 --> 00:20:23.086]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:20:23.086 --> 00:20:25.088]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:20:25.088 --> 00:20:32.234]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:20:32.234 --> 00:20:32.715]  Some U.S.
[00:20:32.715 --> 00:20:38.380]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.563]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:20:42.563 --> 00:20:44.704]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:21:09.485 --> 00:21:11.726]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:11.726 --> 00:21:14.667]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:23.270]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.932]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:21:26.932 --> 00:21:31.473]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:21:31.473 --> 00:21:33.074]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:21:33.454 --> 00:21:34.515]  Take action now!
[00:21:34.515 --> 00:21:39.319]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:43.303]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:46.625]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:53.051]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:21:53.371 --> 00:21:55.432]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 EXT 129.
[00:21:55.432 --> 00:21:56.753]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[00:21:56.753 --> 00:21:58.234]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237 EXT 129.
[00:22:08.962 --> 00:22:12.267]  So you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.
[00:22:12.267 --> 00:22:14.830]  But why settle for bland, tasteless food?
[00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.272]  Why settle for less?
[00:22:16.272 --> 00:22:17.894]  There is an alternative.
[00:22:17.894 --> 00:22:19.636]  InternetGrocer.net.

[00:23:00.234 --> 00:23:00.975]  to 6 p.m.
[00:23:00.975 --> 00:23:02.198]  Central Standard Time.
[00:23:02.198 --> 00:23:05.464]  Or shop online at internet-grocer.net.
[00:23:05.464 --> 00:23:07.268]  Again, that's internet-grocer.net.
[00:23:20.476 --> 00:23:23.759]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done?
[00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:28.202]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[00:23:28.202 --> 00:23:32.025]  Five eastbound just one more bandage run.
[00:23:32.025 --> 00:23:35.988]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[00:23:35.988 --> 00:23:39.031]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make.
[00:23:39.031 --> 00:23:43.374]  The boys up there stickin' Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarkana.
[00:23:52.312 --> 00:23:53.514]  Old Smokey!
[00:23:53.514 --> 00:23:56.336]  He's got his ears on!
[00:24:07.651 --> 00:24:09.652]  And he's hot on your trail.
[00:24:09.652 --> 00:24:11.854]  And he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[00:24:11.854 --> 00:24:13.615]  So you got to dodge him.
[00:24:13.615 --> 00:24:14.736]  You got to duck him.
[00:24:14.736 --> 00:24:17.277]  You got to keep that diesel truckin'.
[00:24:17.277 --> 00:24:19.439]  That's what I see this whole operation that we run here.
[00:24:19.439 --> 00:24:22.141]  It's a fight against the New World Order.
[00:24:22.141 --> 00:24:25.503]  And son, never mind them brakes.
[00:24:25.503 --> 00:24:29.706]  Just like Mr. Vieira said yesterday.
[00:24:29.706 --> 00:24:32.547]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:24:32.547 --> 00:24:34.609]  Go to the sound of the guns.
[00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:39.910]  Get involved in the fight for liberty.
[00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.791]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the true free market.
[00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:46.392]  Expose the private bankers that are looting us.
[00:24:46.392 --> 00:24:55.095]  Expose their operations to seize our key infrastructure.
[00:24:55.095 --> 00:25:03.357]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead, TxDOT says.
[00:25:03.357 --> 00:25:06.158]  And I covered this yesterday, but I'm going to go back into more detail.
[00:25:07.762 --> 00:25:08.222]  Crank it up!
[00:25:43.234 --> 00:25:58.128]  I was listening to Derry Brownfield, who's on the Genesis Network, right before the show, and I heard a caller call in and tell Derry, who's a great guy, syndicated all across the country, that the Trans-Texas Corridor is not dead, because Derry had been reporting that.
[00:25:59.150 --> 00:25:59.831]  And why wouldn't he?
[00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:06.639]  That's what the Associated Press, the Dallas Morning News, all the major TV stations in Texas are reporting.
[00:26:06.639 --> 00:26:17.292]  But if you go to the press release put out by TxDOT, they state on record that they are simply not going to call it the Trans-Texas Corridor anymore.
[00:26:17.853 --> 00:26:30.667]  That they are going to give it a new name and that they are going to not cancel one part of it, one section of 8,000 miles of Texas roads being seized and handed over to foreign companies to put toll roads on them.
[00:26:32.574 --> 00:26:39.956]  Now that's the TxDOT, Trans-Texas Corridor, part of a larger Napa superhighway system in the official federal documents.
[00:26:39.956 --> 00:26:43.277]  It's all in my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:26:43.277 --> 00:26:50.758]  The TxDOT hearings, the documents, the state and the feds own records.
[00:26:50.758 --> 00:26:56.180]  And they want to take 34 major US interstate highways and make those international zones.
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.800]  You'll pay taxes to go on them.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.901]  Those will be the first areas seated like embassies.
[00:27:01.738 --> 00:27:05.843]  That is all in the SPP documents, particularly the ones that Judicial Watch sued to get from September 2007.
[00:27:20.014 --> 00:27:23.175]  September 23rd, 24th in Banff, Canada.
[00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:25.315]  The entire minutes, we got them.
[00:27:25.315 --> 00:27:29.116]  And it says, first issue, keep it secret from the public.
[00:27:29.116 --> 00:27:49.700]  Second issue, this is for the carbon credit tax system where you will pay to use the roads and the money from seizing the 34 major interstate highways and all the sub-state corollary highways, capillary highways, that this will raise hundreds of billions of a year to fund the North American Union.
[00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:54.243]  And it's all available on Judicial Watch's own website.
[00:27:54.243 --> 00:27:58.465]  It's all in my film, Endgame, a blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:27:58.465 --> 00:28:16.293]  So, knowing all of this, we understand that instead of announcing the North American Union Highways, they broke it up into the Indiana Corridor, the Oklahoma Corridor, the California Canamex Corridor, the Arizona Canadian Corridor, the Florida Corridor,
[00:28:17.728 --> 00:28:22.930]  And the main artery, the I-35, Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.612]  That goes all the way up into Canada.
[00:28:26.612 --> 00:28:35.336]  Now, remember, two years ago, the Texas Legislature, that's about to go into session again, they passed a law against turning existing roads over to toll roads.
[00:28:35.336 --> 00:28:36.657]  The Governor just vetoed it.
[00:28:36.657 --> 00:28:41.659]  They announced the plan was dead, to fool everybody, and then move forward and put the toll roads in.
[00:28:41.659 --> 00:28:45.361]  We're going to come back, break down the basic facts here.
[00:28:46.223 --> 00:28:56.527]  And I'm going to get Paul Watson or Steve Watson or Curt Nemo or one of our guys to write an article about this to make it clear that the NAFTA highways are moving forward.
[00:28:56.527 --> 00:28:57.187]  Okay?
[00:28:57.187 --> 00:28:59.308]  Stay with us.
[00:28:59.308 --> 00:29:00.709]  We're on the march.
[00:29:00.709 --> 00:29:03.230]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.911]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.871]  Alex Jones here with a question.

[00:30:09.216 --> 00:30:22.371]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.

[00:32:21.151 --> 00:32:26.633]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[00:32:26.633 --> 00:32:32.035]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:35.617]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[00:32:37.496 --> 00:32:41.081]  It's a death-defying life I lead.
[00:32:41.081 --> 00:32:43.123]  I take my chances.
[00:32:43.123 --> 00:32:45.787]  I die for a living in the movies and TV.
[00:32:48.453 --> 00:32:51.936]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:51.936 --> 00:32:54.438]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:32:54.438 --> 00:32:54.878]  All right.
[00:33:21.195 --> 00:33:28.618]  Let's go ahead and break down the basic facts.
[00:33:28.618 --> 00:33:31.879]  Trans-Texas Corridor is dead, TxDOT says.
[00:33:31.879 --> 00:33:34.900]  And this is out of the Dallas Morning News.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.141]  Yesterday we covered this at the end of the show.
[00:33:37.141 --> 00:33:39.162]  And why am I getting back into this right now?
[00:33:40.612 --> 00:34:02.192]  Because I got emails, I saw comments posted on InfoWars.com when we posted a link to this story with people questioning whether I was right or not by saying that the Trans-Texas Corridor is not dead, and that this is yet another deception by government.
[00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:16.329]  that doesn't work for the people but works for foreign outside interest now this is a microcosm of everything else we deal with in government the trans texas corridor itself was already a deception because all these other
[00:34:18.246 --> 00:34:46.020]  Trans Corridors are all part in the federal documents and in public admissions of the larger NAFTA Super Highway Security and Prosperity Partnership system to take over every major federal and state highway in the United States and place international tolls on it to foreign private companies with a large portion of it then shared with the state, county, federal and international bureaucracy under the North American Union.
[00:34:47.802 --> 00:34:49.523]  Same thing's happening in Chile.
[00:34:49.523 --> 00:34:51.285]  Same thing's happening in Greece.
[00:34:51.285 --> 00:34:53.086]  Same thing's happening in Argentina.
[00:34:53.086 --> 00:34:55.668]  Same thing's happening in Iceland.
[00:34:55.668 --> 00:35:02.532]  They are coming in, buying off your politicians at the local level, and then they just sign on to the international agreements.
[00:35:02.532 --> 00:35:04.934]  And then lie to the public.
[00:35:04.934 --> 00:35:09.137]  And a lot of times when they get caught lying, they say, well we have to do this, we've signed corporate agreements.
[00:35:09.137 --> 00:35:11.078]  The states signed international treaties.
[00:35:11.078 --> 00:35:12.519]  That's what these agreements are.
[00:35:12.519 --> 00:35:15.542]  Well they're frauds, and we say you break them, and you break them now.
[00:35:15.542 --> 00:35:16.702]  Instead of lying to us.
[00:35:18.035 --> 00:35:22.480]  So the Trans-Texas Corridor itself is the crown jewel of all this.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:29.729]  It's got the main super artery, I-35, up the middle that they admit is the center of the whole program nationwide.
[00:35:29.729 --> 00:35:30.730]  And the furthest along.
[00:35:33.976 --> 00:35:36.858]  And so Texans found out it was 8,000 miles of roads.
[00:35:36.858 --> 00:35:53.608]  Texans found out that it would, according to their, TxDOT's own documents two years ago in the state legislature, the state legislature had to sue and then go to state court to make TxDOT, the agency, give them the agreements and documents.
[00:35:53.608 --> 00:35:55.349]  The financial details.
[00:35:55.349 --> 00:36:02.334]  And it turned out that basically no money was being paid by Centra, one of the companies based out of Spain.
[00:36:04.735 --> 00:36:10.738]  The same time they merged with an Australian company and became CentraZachary.
[00:36:10.738 --> 00:36:22.705]  And so that big hoopla forced Centra to say, okay, we'll pay $500 million to the state to basically get all the major roads in Texas and make hundreds of billions in just the first decade.
[00:36:22.705 --> 00:36:28.528]  It's hundreds of billions every year nationwide what these companies would get.
[00:36:28.528 --> 00:36:32.270]  And then the state passed a law, the legislature.
[00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:33.091]  That's who runs the state.
[00:36:35.029 --> 00:36:40.111]  They passed a law saying you can't have any more of these toll roads and you can't put them on existing roads.
[00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:42.752]  So, what did Tex Dodd and Rick Perry announce?
[00:36:42.752 --> 00:36:45.834]  They said, okay, you win, it's all over, no more toll roads.
[00:36:45.834 --> 00:36:52.997]  And everybody went, wait a minute, the toll roads in Dallas and Houston and Austin and all over the country, all over the state, they're still going in.
[00:36:52.997 --> 00:36:55.398]  Rick Perry said, oh, well, I'll just sign a veto of that bill.
[00:36:56.516 --> 00:36:57.817]  And it's going to go forward.
[00:36:57.817 --> 00:36:59.638]  So see, they played possum there.
[00:36:59.638 --> 00:37:08.922]  Because at these TechStop meetings, you'll have 1,200, 1,400, 1,500, in some cases 2,000 people, where the buildings won't even hold them all.
[00:37:08.922 --> 00:37:18.687]  There was one case here in Austin where people were stomping so loud in the big auditorium above, because the bottom auditorium filled up, that the whole building was shaking.
[00:37:18.687 --> 00:37:22.229]  They had a raise of hands, who's for the Trans-Texas Corridor and who's against it.
[00:37:23.928 --> 00:37:32.012]  Six people out of a thousand in the main auditorium raised their hands for it.
[00:37:32.012 --> 00:37:32.992]  So what do they do?
[00:37:32.992 --> 00:37:36.234]  By way of deception, that's what they do.
[00:37:36.234 --> 00:37:40.716]  So now they're coming out and saying in the headline, Trans-Texas Corridor is dead, TxDOT says.
[00:37:40.716 --> 00:37:49.220]  The Austin Department of Transportation announced this morning that it has officially killed the Trans-Texas Corridor, saying that despite the project's visionary aspects, it is clearly not the choice of Texans.
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:53.202]  They're saying, okay, it's visionary, but Texans aren't visionary and you don't want it.
[00:37:54.471 --> 00:37:55.392]  DMV file.
[00:37:55.392 --> 00:38:03.379]  The announcement comes six years after Governor Rick Perry shook up the state's transportation political circles by unveiling an ambitious plan to stretch highways, rail lines, and utilities for hundreds of miles.
[00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:03.619]  It's 8,000 miles.
[00:38:04.764 --> 00:38:07.626]  Along the Interstate 35 and Interstate 69 corridors.
[00:38:07.626 --> 00:38:10.709]  So they deceived there by claiming it's only a few projects.
[00:38:10.709 --> 00:38:17.073]  The plan, which would have cost tens of billions of dollars and relied heavily on private toll roads, was hugely controversial.
[00:38:17.073 --> 00:38:24.039]  Now, if you live in South Texas, East Texas, West Texas, anywhere, you know they were taking over your state highways and saying they were going to put tolls on them.
[00:38:24.039 --> 00:38:26.381]  So you know that's a lie right there when they say it was just I-35 and 69.
[00:38:29.983 --> 00:38:31.584]  Again, it's all deception.
[00:38:31.584 --> 00:38:34.967]  The plan, which would have cost tens of millions of dollars, relied heavily on private toll roads.
[00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:35.628]  We'll see now.
[00:38:35.628 --> 00:38:38.870]  The citizens pay for it, and then they just get to collect the money off of it.
[00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:43.054]  It was hugely controversial.
[00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:54.023]  Amandio Senez, Executive Director of TxDOT, made the announcement that the agency was giving up on the idea at the annual transportation forum in Austin.
[00:38:54.023 --> 00:38:57.606]  Make no mistake, the Trans-Texas Corridor, as we have known it,
[00:38:58.607 --> 00:39:00.188]  No longer exist.
[00:39:00.188 --> 00:39:03.009]  Oh, as we have known it.
[00:39:03.009 --> 00:39:07.532]  Each of the dozens of projects, wait, I just thought it was just two projects, now it's dozens.
[00:39:07.532 --> 00:39:08.692]  Three paragraphs later.
[00:39:08.692 --> 00:39:18.277]  Each of the dozens of projects were linked together under the rubric of the TTC, including the Loop 9 project in Dallas, the I-69 project in the South.
[00:39:18.277 --> 00:39:21.559]  Will remain as stand-alone projects, he said.
[00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:22.439]  See?
[00:39:22.439 --> 00:39:25.621]  And if you read his full press release, it all continues.
[00:39:25.621 --> 00:39:26.021]  All of it.
[00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:28.042]  Every bit, they're just changing the name.
[00:39:29.295 --> 00:39:32.377]  The concept has been diminished, he said.
[00:39:32.377 --> 00:39:33.538]  We recognize the inevitable.
[00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:36.261]  The TTC is not the choice of Texans.
[00:39:36.261 --> 00:39:37.542]  But where has it been diminished?
[00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:39.063]  Only in name.
[00:39:39.063 --> 00:39:41.445]  The real impact of today's news is symbolic.
[00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:47.790]  Oh, then the writer wants you to know that they really get that this is all a fraud, so they just put a little read between the lines.
[00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:54.495]  The real impact of today's news is symbolic, signaling a strategic retreat from an embattled agency, and it is.
[00:39:54.495 --> 00:39:55.496]  It's strategic deception.
[00:39:56.493 --> 00:40:10.822]  The real impact of today's news is symbolic, signaling a strategic retreat by an embattled agency as its chief political sponsor, Governor Rick Perry, who had to rig up a four-way race so he could get re-elected.
[00:40:10.822 --> 00:40:16.205]  When did he get 39% of the vote?
[00:40:16.205 --> 00:40:20.367]  And it just goes on.
[00:40:20.367 --> 00:40:21.888]  The legislature has been clear.
[00:40:21.888 --> 00:40:23.930]  They want transformation, he said.
[00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.951]  That handwriting is on the wall in big bold letters.
[00:40:27.847 --> 00:40:39.556]  That's a little double-speak saying the legislature, that the political energy of the people angry about this is taking over the legislature with anti-New World Order people.
[00:40:39.556 --> 00:40:40.437]  And that's what's happening.
[00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:45.941]  So see, they have to back off because of a big frontal assault by the New World Order to take over our infrastructure.
[00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:48.864]  And they're grabbing the power plants, the water districts, the lakes.
[00:40:48.864 --> 00:40:50.705]  I mean, the foreigners are stealing everything right now.
[00:40:53.632 --> 00:40:58.914]  The private companies that come in and take over the lakes and the water districts are hiring their own armored SWAT teams.
[00:40:58.914 --> 00:41:08.317]  Which are private SWAT teams with police power, chartered under state city charters.
[00:41:08.317 --> 00:41:09.918]  It's totally illegal, they're just doing it.
[00:41:09.918 --> 00:41:15.440]  Just like it's illegal under state law and regulation for all these red light cameras.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.422]  Texas law says you can't have them.
[00:41:19.422 --> 00:41:20.462]  I've had legislators on.
[00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.432]  They supposedly amended the law, but that meant if they jumped through all the hoops, and they didn't.
[00:41:26.432 --> 00:41:34.317]  They don't get the state permits, they don't get the county or city permits, they don't go register as a private detective agency.
[00:41:34.317 --> 00:41:47.205]  Because only a police officer or a private detective registered, or a sworn peace officer bonded, or a bonded, certified, licensed,
[00:41:48.524 --> 00:41:54.068]  Private detective can gather information on individuals for a criminal investigation.
[00:41:54.068 --> 00:41:57.490]  Same reason they had to remove red light cameras five years ago in San Diego.
[00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:10.819]  You can't have a Lockheed Martin Marietta owned red light system making millions of dollars a year per red light, who they got caught by the way shortening the red light, shortening the yellow light to actually get more people to actually slide out in the intersection that caused a bunch of wrecks.
[00:42:10.819 --> 00:42:14.261]  That was a side issue.
[00:42:14.261 --> 00:42:14.942]  So many facets.
[00:42:18.095 --> 00:42:25.501]  No, you can't just, no judge, no jury, no ticket, no witness other than a camera.
[00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:26.902]  There was no process.
[00:42:26.902 --> 00:42:32.086]  It was bypassing our entire system of checks and balances and innocent until proven guilty.
[00:42:32.086 --> 00:42:44.577]  It was bypassing the fact that sworn magistrates and sworn elected sheriffs and chartered police agencies are the only ones that can be out there writing tickets.
[00:42:45.674 --> 00:42:46.415]  Do they care?
[00:42:46.415 --> 00:42:46.875]  No.
[00:42:46.875 --> 00:43:02.526]  They just, the city of Austin, I never played these a few weeks ago when it happened, I meant to get to it, but you can go to YouTube and type in red light cameras Austin and you'll see the local newscast where the city just said, we don't care if it's illegal, the red lights stay.
[00:43:02.526 --> 00:43:04.947]  The red light cameras stay.
[00:43:04.947 --> 00:43:09.791]  Other cities are pulling them out because of the state court rulings saying this is illegal.
[00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:13.572]  And the red light camera company doing this doesn't even care.
[00:43:13.572 --> 00:43:22.513]  They don't even bother to go out when they're confronted with this and get the private investigator license.
[00:43:22.513 --> 00:43:25.414]  And by the way, they just can't get one private investigator license.
[00:43:25.414 --> 00:43:33.716]  Every technician certified for every camera they're operating has to go get the private investigator license.
[00:43:35.672 --> 00:43:46.902]  And still the federal and state courts have rolled over and over again that is a fraud because the original progenitor of the citation is a computer, is a camera.
[00:43:50.555 --> 00:43:52.355]  But this has to be fought out in the courts.
[00:43:52.355 --> 00:43:57.816]  Just like family courts set up at the turn of the last century to carry out eugenics openly.
[00:43:57.816 --> 00:43:59.097]  That's why they were chartered.
[00:43:59.097 --> 00:44:03.577]  To take people's children, to sterilize them, to sterilize women, to do medical testing on people.
[00:44:03.577 --> 00:44:04.818]  There was no jury.
[00:44:04.818 --> 00:44:06.058]  There was no due process.
[00:44:06.058 --> 00:44:08.658]  There was no grand jury indictment.
[00:44:08.658 --> 00:44:09.979]  There was no arrest warrant.
[00:44:09.979 --> 00:44:17.940]  They just come steal your children and then you go before a judge who works for the family court system that's predatory.
[00:44:20.595 --> 00:44:21.475]  And it's a rigged game.
[00:44:21.475 --> 00:44:22.655]  See, it's not due process.
[00:44:22.655 --> 00:44:24.616]  It's not a proper constitutional court.
[00:44:24.616 --> 00:44:25.496]  It is a fraud.
[00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:29.837]  And I've already digressed off the subject of the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:44:29.837 --> 00:44:34.618]  It's just that most governmental actions are frauds.
[00:44:34.618 --> 00:44:49.842]  And now it's going to the extreme, with the LCRA, a private organization, private profits, it's just that the legislature, through a board, appoints its directors.
[00:44:51.482 --> 00:44:53.563]  Take the Lower Colorado River Authority.
[00:44:53.563 --> 00:44:58.886]  Grabbing up water, grabbing up the rivers, grabbing up the lakes, armed SWAT teams, police harassing people.
[00:44:58.886 --> 00:45:03.649]  They've got surveillance cameras all over Austin and other cities they control.
[00:45:03.649 --> 00:45:07.931]  It's an intelligence operation.
[00:45:07.931 --> 00:45:09.832]  What are they up to?
[00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:13.074]  They now have governmental power and they're a private group.
[00:45:13.074 --> 00:45:14.414]  It's a total fraud.
[00:45:14.414 --> 00:45:15.915]  But it's not being challenged.
[00:45:15.915 --> 00:45:19.137]  Just like the stinking red light cameras are a fraud.
[00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:33.917]  And if the police unions knew what was good for them, they'd be fighting against all of this, because you're going to be replaced with mercenaries, with contractors, with computer systems, which are totally unaccountable to the people.
[00:45:33.917 --> 00:45:47.566]  And as bad and corrupt and out of control most police agencies are in this nation, these private corporations coming into the mix is even worse.
[00:45:47.566 --> 00:45:50.908]  So in the final equation, I need Kurt or Paul, Steve,
[00:45:52.145 --> 00:45:57.130]  Aaron, whoever wants to take this mission on, I know you're listening, guys.
[00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:06.238]  We need a basic article that has the headline, Trans-Texas Corridor is not dead.
[00:46:06.238 --> 00:46:19.009]  TxDOT plans to change the name at upcoming meeting, or something like that.
[00:46:20.154 --> 00:46:21.254]  And then you give the facts.
[00:46:21.254 --> 00:46:41.442]  You can pull up, just Google it and pull up hundreds of articles, guys, I know you've even written stories about it, where the legislature said, no, you can't have these toll roads on existing roads, you can't have a foreign company doing this, and by the way, we're not even being paid money, you're just handing these over, and you know, these bids weren't done properly, and you just gave it to one company, and this is a scam, and this is internationalist, and the legislature wasn't consulted.
[00:46:42.261 --> 00:46:43.382]  And they said, okay, it's dead.
[00:46:43.382 --> 00:46:44.103]  You're right, you win.
[00:46:44.103 --> 00:46:46.205]  I told people, I said, that's a fraud.
[00:46:46.205 --> 00:46:49.249]  And then six months later, oh, by the way, we're still doing it all.
[00:46:49.249 --> 00:46:52.192]  The governor just says he doesn't care what the state says.
[00:46:52.192 --> 00:46:53.773]  Number one, you open with that.
[00:46:53.773 --> 00:46:55.836]  And you show how they've done this all over the country.
[00:46:55.836 --> 00:46:58.398]  And how it's part of the larger Napa superhighway grid.
[00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:01.671]  Put some of those maps up, federal and state maps.
[00:47:01.671 --> 00:47:08.177]  Then you explain with his own quotes that, oh, we're just breaking these projects up into sub-projects.
[00:47:08.177 --> 00:47:14.062]  And it's going to continue on, but each project separately, so the public can't organize against the whole operation.
[00:47:14.062 --> 00:47:22.149]  Now they have to organize individually in each regional area, and the globalists will have a better chance of getting most of this project done, 8,000 square miles.
[00:47:25.253 --> 00:47:31.299]  Corridor Watch has a lot of the documents and information in the hundreds of cities and over a hundred counties now.
[00:47:31.299 --> 00:47:34.522]  Last time I checked, signed up against it.
[00:47:34.522 --> 00:47:37.104]  And so we don't let this deception work.
[00:47:37.104 --> 00:47:47.074]  We explain to people this is a strategic fraud as the article says.
[00:47:47.074 --> 00:47:47.735]  It says it is
[00:47:49.491 --> 00:47:50.932]  Strategic.
[00:47:50.932 --> 00:47:58.136]  And the article goes on, others feared that the use of private toll road developers, including firms based in Spain, would amount to a foreign ownership of Texas roads.
[00:47:58.136 --> 00:48:05.421]  I'll never forget, the Austin Chronicle wrote an article years ago saying that we were not telling the truth and that Cintra wasn't Spanish.
[00:48:05.421 --> 00:48:11.605]  I mean, that's like, it just never ends what these people do.
[00:48:11.605 --> 00:48:15.047]  It never ends how stupid they think the public is.
[00:48:17.839 --> 00:48:24.441]  So, this is an outrageous fraud, and it will work, partially, for a while.
[00:48:24.441 --> 00:48:26.121]  It'll buy them time.
[00:48:26.121 --> 00:48:28.362]  I mean, they're slapping every few weeks around Texas.
[00:48:28.362 --> 00:48:31.362]  I see reports of a new toll road, and they're doing it on existing roads.
[00:48:31.362 --> 00:48:38.304]  The way they get around federal and state law, that you can't make an existing road a toll road, a freeway a toll road.
[00:48:38.304 --> 00:48:39.685]  The taxpayers have already paid for it.
[00:48:39.685 --> 00:48:41.105]  It's already budgeted in for us to pay for it.
[00:48:43.416 --> 00:48:47.880]  is they will add an extra shoulder, or they'll add another lane, or they'll fix a bridge.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.661]  They'll say, oh now the whole thing's a new road.
[00:48:49.661 --> 00:48:52.343]  Or they'll change the name of the road.
[00:48:52.343 --> 00:48:58.008]  All lawyer scams.
[00:48:58.008 --> 00:49:01.671]  And then of course, federal law had said before you couldn't make existing roads toll roads.
[00:49:03.422 --> 00:49:16.969]  Well, Bush has signed an executive order last year stating that if states want their toll road or want their Department of Transportation federal money, which money they take from us and send back, that they have to hand their roads over to foreign interest.
[00:49:16.969 --> 00:49:18.790]  Talk about a fraud!
[00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:22.192]  And now Obama talks about this big highway project he's got.
[00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:23.532]  I've looked at it.
[00:49:23.532 --> 00:49:30.536]  All the money is to force states to put toll roads in and to hand it over to foreign interest.
[00:49:34.895 --> 00:49:42.440]  This is the problem with federalization, because all the foreign banks had to do was buy off our government, which they did, and then everything's theirs.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.623]  They own the government through fraud.
[00:49:45.623 --> 00:49:52.507]  Just like we're paying 8.5 trillion into foreign private banks, and then we have to pay them interest on the money that we gave them.
[00:49:52.507 --> 00:49:58.992]  Oh, here's all our money, and then we get to pay you interest for giving you all our money, in taxes.
[00:49:58.992 --> 00:49:59.973]  We'll be right back.
[00:49:59.973 --> 00:50:01.714]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:09.399 --> 00:50:10.300]  You worry.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.382]  You see the signs and worry about the future.
[00:50:12.382 --> 00:50:15.024]  You worry about economic turmoil and food shortages.
[00:50:15.024 --> 00:50:17.146]  How to be prepared while preserving your sanity?
[00:50:17.146 --> 00:50:18.747]  Your answer may be at hand.
[00:50:18.747 --> 00:50:22.350]  Author Linda Runyon lived off the land, isolated from civilization.
[00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:27.595]  She knows that as long as the sun shines, there will be plenty of free food all over God's green earth.
[00:50:27.595 --> 00:50:30.898]  Perhaps the only sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants.
[00:50:31.547 --> 00:50:33.228]  The cost of learning is minimal.
[00:50:33.228 --> 00:50:36.128]  Wild food grows everywhere and you will see it everywhere.
[00:50:36.128 --> 00:50:39.589]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:48.232]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject includes books, flashcards, and video with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[00:50:48.232 --> 00:50:53.054]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it, how to prepare, use, and store it.
[00:50:53.054 --> 00:50:57.075]  Go to Linda's website, ofthefield.com, and take advantage of special offers.
[00:50:57.075 --> 00:50:57.935]  Or if you're not online,
[00:50:58.254 --> 00:51:02.898]  Call her 24-hour, toll-free order line at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:51:02.898 --> 00:51:06.301]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[00:51:06.301 --> 00:51:09.184]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[00:51:09.184 --> 00:51:15.950]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:17.612]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:51:18.587 --> 00:51:20.128]  But who is the enemy?
[00:51:20.128 --> 00:51:20.929]  Bin Laden.
[00:51:20.929 --> 00:51:21.910]  This is his M.O.
[00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.291]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:25.293]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:51:25.293 --> 00:51:32.439]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:51:32.439 --> 00:51:32.920]  Some U.S.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:38.565]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:51:39.265 --> 00:51:42.767]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:51:42.767 --> 00:51:53.251]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:51:53.251 --> 00:51:54.472]  Fabled enemies.

[00:52:02.215 --> 00:52:05.577]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:09.665 --> 00:52:17.749]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight, only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead, or it's just not bright enough?
[00:52:17.749 --> 00:52:19.350]  You need the Paclite!
[00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:27.573]  The Paclite is the longest-lasting flashlight on the market, and simply snaps onto any 9-volt battery, and uses two high-powered LED lights.
[00:52:27.573 --> 00:52:31.135]  It's small enough to carry in your pocket, car, garage, and home.
[00:52:31.135 --> 00:52:35.957]  The Paclite can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[00:52:35.957 --> 00:52:37.218]  The Paclite is so durable,
[00:52:37.498 --> 00:52:42.320]  Soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in the New York Times and Backpacker Magazine.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:47.001]  The PackLite comes with a 25-year warranty, and prices start at just $12.99.
[00:52:47.001 --> 00:52:53.983]  To learn more and see for yourself just how incredible this small flashlight can be, visit 9voltlite.com.

[00:53:02.046 --> 00:53:16.954]  We have to get to the point where we realize just how corrupt the society is and that with a corrupt government
[00:53:31.305 --> 00:53:43.754]  Became the power for outside governments, institutions, corporations, allied crime syndicates of corporations, that's what the New World Order is, to come in and take over everything.
[00:53:43.754 --> 00:53:56.963]  Folks, China didn't have a strong, sovereign government 160 years ago, so the British, the Dutch, the French, the Spanish, the U.S., they went in and they divided the country up into 10 parts.
[00:53:58.732 --> 00:54:00.193]  And it happened just like it's happening today.
[00:54:00.193 --> 00:54:02.133]  The British started bringing in opium over 20 years.
[00:54:02.133 --> 00:54:06.235]  They bought off all the police because opium was illegal there.
[00:54:06.235 --> 00:54:07.335]  It brought great corruption.
[00:54:07.335 --> 00:54:10.396]  They took over the major seaport towns within just a few years.
[00:54:10.396 --> 00:54:14.918]  Then they moved in internally and used that corruption to take over the country.
[00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:18.459]  Then they brought in mercenary armies to protect each sector.
[00:54:18.459 --> 00:54:21.720]  They completely looted the nation.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:27.242]  And that went on right up until 1949 when the CIA helped put Mao Zedong into power and that's now declassified.
[00:54:27.858 --> 00:54:33.002]  That's not just the old-timers blowing the whistle on it, as they did at the time.
[00:54:33.002 --> 00:54:36.445]  David Rockefeller wrote in his memoirs, well two memoirs he wrote, about how great Mao was.
[00:54:36.445 --> 00:54:39.468]  He wrote in the New York Times how great it was and how he wanted that system here.
[00:54:39.468 --> 00:54:41.749]  You go, well why would one of the richest men on earth want communism?
[00:54:41.749 --> 00:54:43.291]  It isn't communism.
[00:54:43.291 --> 00:54:46.433]  It's a bunch of thugs with guns saying it's for the people.
[00:54:46.433 --> 00:54:49.296]  We're taking all the middle classes' wealth and land.
[00:54:49.296 --> 00:54:50.096]  It's for the people.
[00:54:50.096 --> 00:54:52.979]  And then they just hand it over to the international corporations.
[00:54:54.565 --> 00:55:05.231]  A side issue that I'm going to cover in more detail on PrisonPlanet.tv today when we go live at one o'clock central coming up in an hour and five minutes.
[00:55:05.231 --> 00:55:08.172]  Organic whole milk.
[00:55:08.172 --> 00:55:09.713]  Horizon Organic Milk.
[00:55:09.713 --> 00:55:21.700]  And I was sitting there last night looking at it on the counter, actually my wife was and pointed it out, and she said, look, our farms produce this milk without antibiotics, added hormones, pesticides or cloning.
[00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:27.802]  They have to say this is not cloned milk from a cloned cow.
[00:55:27.802 --> 00:55:28.563]  And why is that?
[00:55:28.563 --> 00:55:45.115]  Because we now learn for at least nine years in Canada and the United States that large dairy operations have cloned cows or cows from the offspring, offspring of cloned cows.
[00:55:45.115 --> 00:55:46.036]  And why is this?
[00:55:46.036 --> 00:55:50.940]  Not just that they give the growth hormone to the cows that makes them produce three times as much milk, they find genetic freaks
[00:55:52.042 --> 00:56:02.646]  Who have been engineered to produce massive amounts of milk and then they breed those cloned animals together with all the bizarre DNA alterations that happen there as well.
[00:56:02.646 --> 00:56:14.311]  So we're to the point of having to deal with cloned milk or milk from cloned animals or from cloned herds.
[00:56:14.311 --> 00:56:19.954]  And I say this because a few weeks ago I mentioned that there's cloned milk on store shelves everywhere.
[00:56:21.167 --> 00:56:24.509]  And I got emails and people laughing at me saying, you know, that's ridiculous.
[00:56:24.509 --> 00:56:26.210]  Folks, we're in the 21st century.
[00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.490]  It's 2009.
[00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:28.611]  This stuff is going on.
[00:56:28.611 --> 00:56:29.752]  This is the New World Order.
[00:56:29.752 --> 00:56:30.913]  We're not in a science fiction movie.
[00:56:30.913 --> 00:56:31.833]  We're in reality.
[00:56:31.833 --> 00:56:33.594]  I'm sitting here in my hand.
[00:56:33.594 --> 00:56:37.416]  You can hear the milk.
[00:56:37.416 --> 00:56:40.838]  Having to tell you it's not cloned.
[00:56:40.838 --> 00:56:44.040]  You know they've got chickens that have four legs so they have more meat on them?
[00:56:45.438 --> 00:56:55.361]  Did you know that people are trying to buy, small farms are trying to find original heirloom, I guess you'd call them, old-fashioned chickens and it's hard to get them?
[00:56:55.361 --> 00:57:01.603]  And then small farms now are buying the big GMO engineered chickens and they
[00:57:02.785 --> 00:57:06.107]  Developed within seven weeks, not 12 to 14 weeks.
[00:57:06.107 --> 00:57:11.471]  They've got so much meat on their bones, the turkeys too, that they can't even walk after they're full grown.
[00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:13.272]  They just sit there in the bottom of their cage.
[00:57:13.272 --> 00:57:15.754]  They're designed for big factories.
[00:57:15.754 --> 00:57:17.895]  They're totally genetically engineered and altered.
[00:57:17.895 --> 00:57:21.938]  They have all sorts of other organisms DNA put into them.
[00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:25.080]  It's got all sorts of horrible spinoff effects.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:31.765]  And so then the small farms can't even economically find
[00:57:33.647 --> 00:57:38.252]  Breeder stock for geese.
[00:57:38.252 --> 00:57:40.735]  Same thing for pigs now.
[00:57:40.735 --> 00:57:45.480]  They are basically eradicating all the original life forms.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:51.326]  So enjoy your cloned milk, folks.
[00:57:51.326 --> 00:57:53.848]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:57:53.848 --> 00:57:56.151]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:57:59.177 --> 00:58:01.359]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:58:01.359 --> 00:58:03.782]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:58:03.782 --> 00:58:06.465]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:58:06.465 --> 00:58:07.627]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:07.627 --> 00:58:09.329]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:58:09.329 --> 00:58:12.152]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:58:12.152 --> 00:58:15.856]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:58:25.487 --> 00:58:30.372]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:58:30.372 --> 00:58:31.453]  An inside job.
[00:58:34.159 --> 00:58:36.780]  How dare you?
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:41.662]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:58:41.662 --> 00:58:44.143]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:58:44.143 --> 00:58:51.026]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[00:58:51.026 --> 00:58:53.887]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now.
[00:58:53.887 --> 00:58:56.128]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[00:58:56.128 --> 00:58:58.609]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:59:01.781 --> 00:59:04.182]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:04.182 --> 00:59:13.587]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:13.587 --> 00:59:14.908]  Big Brother.
[00:59:14.908 --> 00:59:16.669]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:16.669 --> 00:59:18.430]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:19.991]  You want answers?
[00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:21.571]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:21.571 --> 00:59:25.754]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:25.754 --> 00:59:29.816]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:37.777]  In one hour, we will be simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:59:37.777 --> 00:59:48.182]  I'm going to go over the latest shooting of an unarmed man restrained by police, and the fact that police lied about what really happened.
[00:59:48.182 --> 00:59:49.983]  Then we've got Ray McGovern joining us.
[00:59:49.983 --> 00:59:53.445]  I also want to show folks on the TV show, and I'll discuss it on radio.
[00:59:55.145 --> 01:00:07.076]  And then later it'll be posted on the web as an archive that now the organic milk companies are having to put that their cows don't come from cloned herds, because that's how far cloning has gone.
[01:00:07.076 --> 01:00:09.799]  And we'll break down some of the dangers of that briefly as well.
[01:00:09.799 --> 01:00:14.523]  Ray McGovern joins us, and then Barry Cooper in studio.
[01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:19.288]  Former police officer, narcotics officer, who's been out there busting cops, running all sorts of scams.
[01:00:20.865 --> 01:00:30.668]  He is going to be in studio with us today, so that is very exciting and will be live with us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:36.650]  Before our first guest comes on, Eric Plumlee, attorney on cell phone surveillance.
[01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:44.092]  I wanted to play a little clip to break it down of a little compilation of mainstream newscast that I saw on YouTube a few days ago.
[01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:46.813]  That spurred us to get him on the show.
[01:00:46.813 --> 01:01:01.986]  And again, this is kind of old hat for myself and our main audience that's been here for, in some cases, thirteen years, because I've been covering it for twelve, or almost thirteen since 2006 when I read the Telecommunications Act that stated all of this.
[01:01:01.986 --> 01:01:04.008]  People said, oh, that's a conspiracy.
[01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:11.634]  By federal law, the cell phones are designed to where the NSA or any other private group, and they admit in these newscasts that private citizens can do this as well.
[01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:14.365]  It's just a felony if you do.
[01:01:14.365 --> 01:01:20.410]  Dial into somebody's cell phone and trigger it and listen to everything you're doing, even when the cell phone's off.
[01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.812]  And of course, then it has the GPS triangulation.
[01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:29.778]  There's not GPS in the phone, there's GPS markers in the cell towers that triangulate you down to just a few feet.
[01:01:29.778 --> 01:01:33.321]  Federal law says within 15 feet, but it really triangulates down to about three and a half feet.
[01:01:34.966 --> 01:01:37.248]  And so we'll be going over that.
[01:01:37.248 --> 01:01:39.490]  And then realize it's all your other devices.
[01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:48.097]  Your home computer has Google and others, in their own words, using the built-in microphone to listen to you with an AI computer recording everything you say in a database.
[01:01:48.097 --> 01:01:51.380]  And folks are worried about cookies.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:58.066]  They can also dial in to the camera that is built-in to almost every brand of computer now.
[01:01:58.066 --> 01:02:01.328]  It's right above the screen that is watching you.
[01:02:01.328 --> 01:02:02.850]  And I tell people this and they just
[01:02:03.846 --> 01:02:08.087]  It's so Orwellian, even dumbed down general public knows that's Big Brother.
[01:02:08.087 --> 01:02:11.768]  So their instinct is, it's not true.
[01:02:11.768 --> 01:02:20.291]  Or their instinct is, oh it's not true, they have foreign banks haven't stolen 8.5 trillion, and War Powers Act hasn't been declared, and the Congress isn't under martial law.
[01:02:20.291 --> 01:02:24.752]  No, no, no, everything's fine, everything's fine.
[01:02:24.752 --> 01:02:30.074]  No, everything is not fine.
[01:02:30.074 --> 01:02:32.455]  And then even when TextDot comes out,
[01:02:33.527 --> 01:02:38.729]  With their favorite tactic of saying, we're not building a Napa Superhighway, we're not building a Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:02:38.729 --> 01:02:42.230]  Then they put up the billboards that said Trans-Texas Corridor and started putting the toll roads in.
[01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:46.451]  They denied they were ever going to put toll roads in while they were building the toll road boxes.
[01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:49.152]  The toll road machines, the toll road scanners.
[01:02:49.152 --> 01:02:50.032]  Five, six years ago.
[01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:53.954]  They would say, we're not doing it, we're not putting a toll road on there.
[01:02:53.954 --> 01:02:59.155]  Then they did it and said, well it's not a toll road, it's a, it's a fee lane.
[01:02:59.155 --> 01:03:00.536]  So they play semantical games.
[01:03:03.394 --> 01:03:06.335]  And people in government, in big corporations, they're all trained in this.
[01:03:06.335 --> 01:03:07.136]  They know they're lying.
[01:03:07.136 --> 01:03:10.457]  You can see them on television and hear them on the radio every day, read them in the newspaper.
[01:03:10.457 --> 01:03:13.519]  They are just a lot of deceptive crooks.
[01:03:13.519 --> 01:03:15.580]  And that's why they're hired.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:20.782]  They compete with each other over who is the most deceptive.
[01:03:20.782 --> 01:03:28.586]  And if you don't like what's happening now, imagine what they're going to be doing in the future if we don't turn this around and don't educate the public about what's developing and happening.
[01:03:30.515 --> 01:03:34.351]  Speaking of PrisonPlanet.tv, our PrisonPlanet.tv members don't just...
[01:03:36.513 --> 01:03:43.659]  You know, have the archive that's uploaded within a few hours of the live video transmission TV show we do, Simulcast with Radio.
[01:03:43.659 --> 01:03:44.720]  You can watch it live.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:58.692]  So coming up in 55 minutes, 21 seconds, we'll go live at PrisonPlanet.tv and I want to encourage PrisonPlanet.tv members to go over there, log in, right there at the top of PrisonPlanet.tv, just enter your username and passcode and you're on and I want you to tune into the show.
[01:03:58.692 --> 01:04:01.195]  Make sure all the members out there use that feature.
[01:04:01.855 --> 01:04:09.660]  All right, we'll be right back with the cell phones, tracking everything you're doing, what's happening with the economy, and a lot more.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.361]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:11.361 --> 01:04:16.104]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:04:16.104 --> 01:04:19.066]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:04:19.066 --> 01:04:22.108]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:26.831]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[01:04:27.051 --> 01:04:28.231]  If you simply prepare.
[01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:31.972]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[01:04:31.972 --> 01:04:34.032]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[01:04:34.032 --> 01:04:35.853]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[01:04:35.853 --> 01:04:39.833]  They voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of thin air.
[01:04:39.833 --> 01:04:42.634]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[01:04:42.634 --> 01:04:48.855]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities.
[01:04:48.855 --> 01:04:51.775]  Particularly food, beyond many Americans reach.
[01:04:51.775 --> 01:04:56.256]  In pre-Nazi Germany superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days.
[01:04:56.536 --> 01:04:58.858]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[01:04:58.858 --> 01:05:03.321]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[01:05:03.321 --> 01:05:09.005]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:12.267]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[01:05:12.267 --> 01:05:15.389]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[01:05:15.609 --> 01:05:17.431]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[01:05:17.431 --> 01:05:21.495]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[01:05:21.495 --> 01:05:25.639]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[01:05:25.639 --> 01:05:33.166]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:37.110]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:39.973]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:47.316]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:05:47.316 --> 01:05:50.597]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:05:50.597 --> 01:05:51.517]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[01:05:51.517 --> 01:05:55.759]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:05:55.759 --> 01:06:02.001]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, freeze-dried, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[01:06:02.001 --> 01:06:03.102]  Watch the free videos.
[01:06:03.322 --> 01:06:05.784]  Look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:05.784 --> 01:06:07.044]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:07.044 --> 01:06:07.745]  Take action today.
[01:06:07.745 --> 01:06:09.566]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:06:17.327 --> 01:06:24.309]  News stories recently revealed that the FBI used ordinary cell phones to monitor the room conversations of suspects.
[01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:38.512]  This could be accomplished by changes to the phone's firmware, the internal software that makes them run, which might require physical access to the phone, or could even be done remotely in some cases, depending on the phone and the level of cellular company cooperation.
[01:06:38.932 --> 01:06:46.015]  Now, unless you're a mobster, terrorist, or perhaps a peace activist, you're not likely to be targeted this way by the authorities.
[01:06:46.015 --> 01:06:50.096]  But it's also possible that illicit bugs could be implemented the same way.
[01:06:50.096 --> 01:06:58.859]  And it's always worthwhile to know your technology, so let's look at some easy clues that might suggest that something unusual could be going on with your cell phone.
[01:07:04.637 --> 01:07:10.942]  The trick is to remember that everything done on these phones needs electricity, and that all comes from the batteries.
[01:07:10.942 --> 01:07:15.906]  These batteries will degrade over time, and tend to give reduced service after many charges.
[01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:31.538]  But in general, if you suddenly notice that your phone's battery is running out much faster than usual, and you haven't been talking more, this could suggest that your phone is busily transmitting room conversations via its microphone while you thought it was idle, and so draining the battery more rapidly.
[01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:42.222]  In such a case, turning off the phone may not actually stop this behavior, since firmware could be altered to make a phone look like it was turned off when it was actually still on.
[01:07:42.222 --> 01:07:47.565]  Taking out the battery, though, is pretty much a sure thing to shut down all significant activity.
[01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:55.588]  And don't worry, there's not enough room in most modern cell phones for hidden extra batteries of a size that could do much more than keep the phone's clock running.
[01:07:56.883 --> 01:07:59.648]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:59.648 --> 01:08:02.473]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:38.315 --> 01:08:39.156]  All right, folks.
[01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:41.197]  We are back live here.
[01:08:41.197 --> 01:08:43.839]  John, let's go back to that cell phone clip.
[01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:47.521]  I wanted to play more of that.
[01:08:47.521 --> 01:08:50.303]  Okay, John?
[01:08:50.303 --> 01:08:50.683]  Oh, okay.
[01:08:50.683 --> 01:08:51.244]  Fantastic.
[01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.806]  Yeah, I mean, that's like a 20-minute clip.
[01:08:53.806 --> 01:08:56.607]  It's got a bunch of clips where the news is admitting this.
[01:08:56.607 --> 01:09:08.372]  Because I want to try to somehow shake the public out of their denial about how these devices, everything that we use in our lives, has been designed and set up to track and trace and surveillance.
[01:09:08.372 --> 01:09:10.633]  I mean, this is a total control grid being put in.
[01:09:10.633 --> 01:09:11.894]  Here's some more.
[01:09:11.894 --> 01:09:14.595]  That could do much more than keep the phone's clock running.
[01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:27.947]  A similar clue that your phone may be transmitting behind your back is if it just seems warmer than usual between calls.
[01:09:27.947 --> 01:09:32.030]  You've probably noticed that cell phones tend to get warm as you talk longer.
[01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:38.875]  This is normal while calls are in progress, but it would be very odd indeed if your phone didn't cool off some between calls.
[01:09:39.435 --> 01:09:52.959]  Both of these clues, especially the unusually rapid draining of the phone's battery, could also be indications that room audio is being recorded within the flash memory of the phone for later bulk transmission via the phone's data capabilities.
[01:09:52.959 --> 01:09:56.380]  And bulk transmission can be more difficult to detect.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:01.282]  Modern phones can contain a lot of flash memory, so this is a real possibility.
[01:10:07.461 --> 01:10:18.013]  Finally, if you have a conventional GSM phone, the type used most around the world and the standard for both AT&T Singular and T-Mobile, your ears can tell you what's going on.
[01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:24.780]  You've probably heard the annoying GSM buzz interference that can leak into speakers and other audio equipment during calls.
[01:10:29.907 --> 01:10:32.508]  That's what an actual call sounds like.
[01:10:32.508 --> 01:10:34.769]  A continuing pulsed buzzing.
[01:10:34.769 --> 01:10:41.151]  If your phone was bugging you in real time, the transmission of the room audio would usually create this same sound.
[01:10:41.151 --> 01:10:46.712]  If you hear it between calls, that's a possible indication that your phone may have been compromised.
[01:10:46.712 --> 01:10:57.456]  Note that there is similar interference that can occur briefly between phone calls at various intervals for voicemail indications, text messages, and phone control updates to the mobile network.
[01:10:57.956 --> 01:11:09.276]  These can occur at any time, like these.
[01:11:09.276 --> 01:11:11.479]  But the continuous pulsing buzzing like this
[01:11:15.086 --> 01:11:19.531]  Will normally only occur during calls or continuous data transmission.
[01:11:19.531 --> 01:11:24.276]  And that's the sound to be suspicious of if you hear it when your phone is supposedly idle.
[01:11:24.276 --> 01:11:31.845]  This interference listening technique is much less useful if you have a CDMA technology phone, like from Verizon or Sprint in the US.
[01:11:32.325 --> 01:11:40.131]  Or if you're using a new 3G GSM phone in 3G mode, which also uses a type of CDMA technology.
[01:11:40.131 --> 01:11:46.136]  Since much less audible interference is produced from these phones, you may not be able to hear it at all.
[01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:51.700]  But the battery and heat-related clues from earlier will still likely work fine, even in these cases.
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:55.101]  Your cell phone almost certainly isn't a bug.
[01:11:55.101 --> 01:12:04.605]  But it never hurts to know what is and isn't possible, especially with an expanding and powerful technology that most of us carry with us wherever we go.
[01:12:04.605 --> 01:12:07.646]  Until next time, be seeing you.
[01:12:07.646 --> 01:12:12.047]  If you power down your cell phone, there's no way the government could ever hear you.
[01:12:12.047 --> 01:12:13.208]  Certainly not the FBI.
[01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:15.268]  It's turned off, right?
[01:12:15.268 --> 01:12:16.469]  Have we got news for you.
[01:12:18.394 --> 01:12:21.155]  Alright, here's that cell phone story you've been waiting for.
[01:12:21.155 --> 01:12:24.497]  Cell phone users beware, Big Brother may be listening.
[01:12:24.497 --> 01:12:31.180]  The Federal Bureau of Investigation can now hear everything you say, even when the cell phone is turned off.
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:42.326]  I know, it sounds kind of out there, but using your phone's tracking device, authorities can now activate the microphone inside the dreaded thing, allowing them to eavesdrop on you and your conversations.
[01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:51.332]  Serious business, and the FBI used this form of surveillance to keep tabs on critical conversations by people they call known members of the mafia.
[01:12:51.332 --> 01:12:55.054]  Experts say the only way around it is to take the battery out of the thing.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.703]  To nab some of the nation's most wanted mobsters.
[01:13:06.703 --> 01:13:12.168]  And now, high-tech surveillance has found its way in what many consider their security blanket.
[01:13:12.168 --> 01:13:12.909]  Cell phones.
[01:13:12.909 --> 01:13:13.590]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:14.150]  Put it on your slides.
[01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:16.433]  Eric Harriman is here now with a warning.
[01:13:16.433 --> 01:13:18.415]  If you've got a cell phone, beware.
[01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:19.875]  That is right.
[01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:23.437]  Alveda, Tom, we've all heard of hidden cameras or an office being bugged, right?
[01:13:23.437 --> 01:13:27.118]  It's been in just about every detective movie, but how about being tracked?
[01:13:27.118 --> 01:13:31.159]  Your every word, your every move, followed by someone else.
[01:13:31.159 --> 01:13:35.981]  It's happening, and the culprit is something that's probably in your sight right now.
[01:13:35.981 --> 01:13:41.743]  Your cell phone.
[01:13:41.743 --> 01:13:43.844]  Who's watching?
[01:13:43.844 --> 01:13:45.564]  Who's listening?
[01:13:45.564 --> 01:13:46.505]  And who's tracking?
[01:13:48.311 --> 01:13:49.612]  Your every move.
[01:13:49.612 --> 01:13:54.797]  If you're willing to write the check, if you're willing to spend the money, then there's no phone that's not secure.
[01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:58.220]  Your own cell phone could be your worst enemy.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.143]  The eyes and ears for someone else.
[01:14:01.143 --> 01:14:02.584]  But it's not particularly difficult.
[01:14:02.584 --> 01:14:05.607]  A simple software download and you're in.
[01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:10.411]  How much time do you actually need with a phone to have complete access to everything on it?
[01:14:10.411 --> 01:14:10.852]  Ten minutes.
[01:14:11.727 --> 01:14:15.830]  So ten on your side decided to make an investment in your safety.
[01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:20.554]  We're not going to show you exactly how it's done, rather a warning it can be done.
[01:14:20.554 --> 01:14:22.355]  We bought the software online.
[01:14:22.355 --> 01:14:25.517]  Sure enough, a few days later, it arrived via email.
[01:14:25.517 --> 01:14:26.338]  You got mail!
[01:14:26.338 --> 01:14:27.399]  Of course, it's very illegal.
[01:14:29.528 --> 01:14:31.370]  To do it to somebody without their permission.
[01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:34.934]  So I gave Joe written permission to tap my cell phone.
[01:14:34.934 --> 01:14:39.258]  A quick download enables remote surveillance of your phone.
[01:14:39.258 --> 01:14:44.244]  With the click of a mouse, the phone's microphone can be remotely activated.
[01:14:44.244 --> 01:14:48.208]  The same technology that allows you to use speakerphone is now a spy.
[01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:48.949]  You can listen
[01:14:49.798 --> 01:14:54.700]  From any, either a computer or telephone of your choice.
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:55.620]  And that's not all.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:15:00.682]  Text messages can be monitored and locations can be tracked using GPS.
[01:15:00.682 --> 01:15:05.164]  Is there any way for the person that has the phone to know what you did to it?
[01:15:05.164 --> 01:15:05.684]  No.
[01:15:05.684 --> 01:15:09.806]  What's worse, even turning the phone off doesn't stop the snooping.
[01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:10.886]  We put it to the test.
[01:15:10.886 --> 01:15:13.307]  We're trying to remotely activate his cell phone and there it is.
[01:15:13.307 --> 01:15:13.848]  And we're good.
[01:15:13.848 --> 01:15:17.249]  Can you, can you stop, please?
[01:15:25.245 --> 01:15:29.267]  Alright, well, listen, I should be there by around noon.
[01:15:29.267 --> 01:15:41.012]  If I'm not there by, like, 1230, then that means I got stuck in a meeting, and I'll call you as soon as I get out, alright?
[01:15:41.012 --> 01:15:46.714]  Yeah, I'd just like to make a transfer of funds, please, for my checking account, please.
[01:15:46.714 --> 01:15:52.277]  Not only was Joe eavesdropping on my every word... How you doing, man?
[01:15:53.368 --> 01:15:55.572]  He was also following my every move.
[01:15:55.572 --> 01:15:56.213]  Who uses this?
[01:16:01.184 --> 01:16:01.964]  Anyone can use it.
[01:16:01.964 --> 01:16:07.347]  But be prepared to face consequences if the person on the other end doesn't know what's happening.
[01:16:07.347 --> 01:16:10.468]  That's where the illegality occurs.
[01:16:10.468 --> 01:16:12.169]  Okay.
[01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:18.192]  And we've got Chesapeake Attorney Eric Plumlee coming up in about 14 minutes from now.
[01:16:18.192 --> 01:16:26.636]  The reason I played this is as good and as informative as these little newscasts we're playing clips of are, they don't explain to you why this ever happened.
[01:16:27.606 --> 01:16:35.437]  Under federal law, the cell phones in 1996 had to implement this, and it was a sliding scale.
[01:16:35.437 --> 01:16:44.709]  By 2007, they had to have an agreed upon platform and follow what the federal government said for the applications for snooping by the NSA, FBI, and others.
[01:16:45.785 --> 01:16:54.753]  By 1998, they had to have their newest cell phones equipped with this, and by 2001, October 1st, by law, set in 1996, all phones by law have this in them.
[01:17:01.969 --> 01:17:15.195]  So again, the federal government did this, and they're now admitting in England and the US that the national ID cards we carry, you didn't know you had one, even your state ID is federally controlled, it's in a federal database, that is causing massive identity theft.
[01:17:15.195 --> 01:17:18.417]  It's those databases, it's the use of those cards.
[01:17:18.417 --> 01:17:23.339]  The media likes to act like the internet's what's causing identity theft, most of it is banks.
[01:17:23.339 --> 01:17:27.001]  Remember Bank of America, like last year, was it 3 million names in whole
[01:17:28.797 --> 01:17:31.858]  You know, where they live, their passcodes, everything, quote, got stolen.
[01:17:31.858 --> 01:17:34.239]  It's people inside the companies.
[01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:35.099]  It's like a bank robbery.
[01:17:35.099 --> 01:17:36.199]  They steal millions of names.
[01:17:36.199 --> 01:17:39.640]  They can sell them on the black market for millions of dollars.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:49.763]  And a lot of this comes out of Pakistan, out of India, out of Russia, out of Israel, are some of the biggest nations that are safe houses where the government's turned a blind eye to big crime syndicates.
[01:17:49.763 --> 01:17:56.525]  I mean, whole office buildings filled with people using this stolen data.
[01:17:56.525 --> 01:17:57.846]  Well, now Google
[01:17:59.682 --> 01:18:07.168]  Is using its systems to listen to your computer, everything over the microphone, based on the computer going on in your house, and just everything else.
[01:18:07.168 --> 01:18:13.894]  This cell phone situation is only the surface of a very, very deep well of Orwellian control.
[01:18:13.894 --> 01:18:15.335]  Well, it's worse than what Orwell envisioned.
[01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:22.192]  What will you do when the economy collapses, store shelves are empty, and your stored food is gone?
[01:18:22.192 --> 01:18:24.033]  How will you feed your family?
[01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:31.376]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring a well-balanced diet for your family.
[01:18:31.376 --> 01:18:38.820]  GetSeeds.net is offering 100 different varieties of GM-free vegetable seeds for only $49 with free shipping.
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:42.401]  You get over 14,000 seeds for only $49.

[01:18:46.323 --> 01:18:47.244]  I think so.
[01:19:16.803 --> 01:19:20.928]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:19:20.928 --> 01:19:33.641]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:33.641 --> 01:19:34.081]  The U.S.
[01:19:34.081 --> 01:19:39.627]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:40.047 --> 01:19:43.009]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:43.009 --> 01:19:45.211]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:45.211 --> 01:19:48.193]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:48.193 --> 01:19:54.637]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:54.637 --> 01:19:58.059]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:19:58.059 --> 01:20:04.404]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.

[01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:18.342]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:20:18.342 --> 01:20:21.966]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:20:21.966 --> 01:20:24.308]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:20:24.308 --> 01:20:27.451]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:33.197]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:20:33.197 --> 01:20:36.681]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet the

[01:23:31.342 --> 01:23:33.424]  I'm going to cover some of that in just a moment.
[01:23:33.424 --> 01:23:41.429]  We're getting into a little report for 30 minutes with a lawyer that's out there exposing the fact that cell phones are tracking, tracing, and listening to you.
[01:23:41.429 --> 01:23:44.191]  That is coming up.
[01:23:44.191 --> 01:23:52.117]  Before I get back into the financial news here briefly, I want to tell you that you need to listen very carefully, folks.
[01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:58.404]  We have to store food for our families if we're going to stay free and stay alive.
[01:23:58.404 --> 01:24:04.488]  That is the prime rule of power, that you control nations with oil and people with food.
[01:24:04.488 --> 01:24:10.091]  And over and over again, tyrants use food as a weapon of federal control.
[01:24:10.091 --> 01:24:15.895]  So if you're going to be independent, it starts with firearms and food, and the capability and the willingness to defend them.
[01:24:15.895 --> 01:24:21.138]  And I'm not saying all these horrible things are going to happen, though, they're a probability now.
[01:24:21.138 --> 01:24:21.999]  Probability is high.
[01:24:24.195 --> 01:24:28.257]  The point is, we need to be independent and not under other people's control.
[01:24:28.257 --> 01:24:30.158]  And a great way to do that is with high-quality, storable foods.
[01:24:30.158 --> 01:24:35.601]  And the place I get my food is eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com, the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:24:35.601 --> 01:24:39.523]  Give them a call at 1-800-409-5633, talk to their great folks.
[01:24:39.523 --> 01:24:45.987]  Get a brochure or an audio CD, go watch videos at their website showing you their products and breaking down the facts.
[01:24:45.987 --> 01:24:51.530]  eFoods, the letter E, eFoodsDirect.com, big fat banners on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:24:56.388 --> 01:25:04.333]  Now, on the economy, later in the show I'm going to get more into this, but right now let me get into some of it.
[01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:08.095]  Analysts predict 40% unemployment, no recovery until 2015.
[01:25:08.095 --> 01:25:09.816]  Webeatthestreet.com reports on this.
[01:25:09.816 --> 01:25:17.440]  We think we now have enough data for both the fundamentals and the technicals to make some serious forecasts and predictions for 2009.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.282]  They've been very accurate on this site.
[01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:26.826]  Well 2008 was a nasty year with lots of things imploded that are far from being repaired.
[01:25:26.826 --> 01:25:31.809]  Treasury Secretary Paulson told us this week that there was no more surprises, which they always lie.
[01:25:31.809 --> 01:25:33.870]  Remember they said two years ago we weren't in a recession.
[01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:39.213]  Which tells me we haven't even discovered a small portion of this monster derivatives mess.
[01:25:39.213 --> 01:25:46.517]  Remember they said over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again that the economy was great two years ago.
[01:25:46.517 --> 01:25:48.298]  The worst of the banking crisis was over.
[01:25:49.482 --> 01:25:54.645]  His ripping off of the taxpayers, the tune of $700 billion, $8.5 trillion, is only a warm-up.
[01:25:54.645 --> 01:25:59.168]  However, the larger question for traders and investors is what could happen next and when.
[01:25:59.168 --> 01:26:03.251]  In the following report, we take the key global economic points and suggest the outcome of 2009.
[01:26:03.251 --> 01:26:10.276]  The most important news for 2008 was the destruction of the big global banks' net worth.
[01:26:10.276 --> 01:26:11.557]  Again, that's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:26:11.557 --> 01:26:13.118]  They've already moved their assets out.
[01:26:13.118 --> 01:26:17.661]  Their badly wounded ability to conduct normal business and make market move, loan plans.
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:25.487]  And then it goes on into what they believe is going to happen.
[01:26:25.487 --> 01:26:30.313]  And that is just a deepening crisis into depression and then no way of coming out of it until 2015.
[01:26:30.313 --> 01:26:31.374]  Now this is the head policy maker.
[01:26:36.698 --> 01:26:43.742]  At the Bank of England, that is the center of the web, warns that within five years global dumping of dollars assets could be complete.
[01:26:43.742 --> 01:26:51.407]  That's right, two plus years ago the world began moving away from dollars, not buying as many dollars, moving into an index basket of other world currencies.
[01:26:51.407 --> 01:26:55.449]  Yen, Yon, Ruble, Euro, Pound.
[01:26:55.449 --> 01:27:05.855]  A former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has predicted a massive collapse of the dollar within the next two to five years, warning that the government increase in spending under President-elect Obama could be disastrous.
[01:27:09.272 --> 01:27:24.576]  Willem Buteer, who served as the BOE from June of 1997 to May 2000, has stated that he expects to see the plug pulled from under the dollar as foreign investors turn away from the dollar and other U.S.-backed assets, including government bonds.
[01:27:24.576 --> 01:27:32.438]  Writing for the Financial Times of London, Buteer, now a professor at the London School of Economics, European Institute, comments, let's get him on, there will be
[01:27:34.773 --> 01:27:39.918]  Before long, my best guess is between two and five years from now, a global dumping of U.S.
[01:27:39.918 --> 01:27:41.039]  dollar assets, including U.S.
[01:27:41.039 --> 01:27:42.540]  government assets.
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:43.401]  Old habits die hard.
[01:27:43.401 --> 01:27:43.721]  The U.S.
[01:27:43.721 --> 01:27:48.405]  dollar and the Treasury bills and bonds are still viewed as a safe haven by many.
[01:27:48.405 --> 01:27:49.646]  But learning takes place.
[01:27:49.646 --> 01:27:53.990]  I'll tell you more about what he had to say later as we get back into the economic news.
[01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.410]  Stay with us.
[01:27:54.410 --> 01:28:00.616]  We'll get into the overall surveillance grid when we get back with Attorney Eric
[01:28:01.889 --> 01:28:05.274]  Plumlee on Cell Phone Surveillance.
[01:28:05.274 --> 01:28:07.057]  Stay with us.
[01:28:07.057 --> 01:28:08.439]  We're on the march.
[01:28:08.439 --> 01:28:10.963]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:10.963 --> 01:28:13.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:17.088 --> 01:28:20.611]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:28:20.611 --> 01:28:26.015]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:28:26.015 --> 01:28:31.159]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:28:31.159 --> 01:28:42.288]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:28:42.668 --> 01:28:48.450]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:54.713]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:28:54.713 --> 01:28:55.753]  What about you?
[01:28:55.753 --> 01:29:02.196]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[01:29:16.565 --> 01:29:23.271]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:29:23.271 --> 01:29:24.933]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:29:25.908 --> 01:29:27.449]  But who is the enemy?
[01:29:27.449 --> 01:29:28.249]  Bin Laden.
[01:29:28.249 --> 01:29:29.209]  This is his M.O.
[01:29:29.209 --> 01:29:30.610]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:32.611]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:29:32.611 --> 01:29:39.754]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:29:39.754 --> 01:29:40.234]  Some U.S.
[01:29:40.234 --> 01:29:45.857]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:29:46.577 --> 01:29:50.458]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:29:50.458 --> 01:30:00.560]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.780]  Fabled enemies.

[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:21.204]  Phase 1 of the Insiders' plan for a One World Government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[01:30:21.204 --> 01:30:28.650]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new World Bank to act as savior.
[01:30:28.650 --> 01:30:30.272]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[01:30:30.272 --> 01:30:34.435]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[01:30:34.435 --> 01:30:38.258]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[01:30:38.258 --> 01:30:42.302]  The Insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[01:30:42.723 --> 01:30:47.081]  Phase 1 is a One World Currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[01:30:47.081 --> 01:30:48.166]  Phase 2 of their incentive...

[01:30:55.847 --> 01:30:59.470]  That's www.foodshortageusa.com.

[01:31:32.481 --> 01:31:47.174]  Earlier in the hour, I played some newscast clips that Eric Plumlee was in and others, breaking down that not just the government, who by law made the cell phone manufacturers
[01:31:48.663 --> 01:31:52.525]  Put these surveillance platforms into all phones by law, October 1st, 2001.
[01:31:52.525 --> 01:31:58.807]  They passed the law in 96, but again, gave them that time to have it by law on all phones.
[01:31:58.807 --> 01:32:03.169]  But that folks can buy the software, download the software, and do it to anybody else they wish.
[01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:11.933]  You can also easily, not just tune into somebody's phone, even when it's turned off, you have to take the battery out to stop it from happening, but also physically track you.
[01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:19.452]  And finally, the public is figuring this out, but this is being engineered into all major communications platforms.
[01:32:19.452 --> 01:32:24.294]  So I wanted to talk to this attorney and find out how he got involved in all of this.
[01:32:24.294 --> 01:32:32.537]  He does criminal law, domestic relations, family law, divorce, felonies, misdemeanors, and he joins us now.
[01:32:32.537 --> 01:32:33.917]  Thank you for coming on, sir.
[01:32:33.917 --> 01:32:35.738]  Sure, thanks for having me.
[01:32:35.738 --> 01:32:38.159]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and how you got involved in all of this.
[01:32:38.837 --> 01:32:45.039]  Well, as you just stated, I am a criminal defense attorney and I do a ton of domestic relations law.
[01:32:45.039 --> 01:32:51.061]  And as you would imagine, there's a tremendous amount of overlap in between those two practice areas.
[01:32:51.061 --> 01:33:07.027]  And it comes up frequently where criminal charges actually stem from domestic relations matters where somebody has just gone too far to try to surveil a suspected cheating spouse or to gain some advantage in a custody proceeding or
[01:33:07.671 --> 01:33:12.393]  Something of that nature, and so it comes up in the practice area.
[01:33:12.393 --> 01:33:35.503]  As far as my appearance on the local TV station, it wasn't uncommon for me to do certain things, and it was actually their brainchild because they had, I guess, been tipped off to this sort of disturbing way that people can be tracked and monitored, and they wanted to get a little snippet of the legality of it all, or in this case, the illegality of it all.
[01:33:35.683 --> 01:33:39.286]  Well, that's why we have you here, because this is becoming very widespread.
[01:33:39.286 --> 01:33:40.927]  No one knows exactly how widespread.
[01:33:40.927 --> 01:33:43.188]  The federal government has been caught.
[01:33:43.188 --> 01:33:48.612]  The FBI using OnStar, which is a cell phone platform, to tune in and surveil people.
[01:33:48.612 --> 01:33:52.815]  We know the NSA has been doing it, and they brag about it, and it's being used against the general public.
[01:33:53.175 --> 01:34:03.819]  Without warrants many times, but your particular entry into this whole fracas is then dealing with these custody battles or cases where husbands and wives are spying on each other.
[01:34:03.819 --> 01:34:07.641]  Let's look at that aspect because that's your expertise.
[01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:19.766]  I mean, break down exactly the different formats, the different ways people are being spied on, or their location being tracked, or audibly being listened to, and from your view in this, how widespread it is.
[01:34:20.404 --> 01:34:38.636]  Well, you know, it's interesting how you would think that there would be a logical continuum of what's legal and then what is not, and that it would seem to, if you could do X, then Y would certainly not be permissible or vice versa, but it's kind of weird the way it's chopped up.
[01:34:38.636 --> 01:34:45.281]  If you have a telephone conversation that you are a party to, contrary to popular belief in the Commonwealth of Virginia,
[01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:52.415]  You can actually tape record a conversation that you're a party to without the permission of the other party.
[01:34:52.415 --> 01:34:59.883]  Most states, only Connecticut and a few others, don't let you do that and they call that the wiretapping laws, correct?
[01:34:59.883 --> 01:35:09.752]  Well, wiretapping in Virginia takes on a little bit of a different characteristic where wiretapping under Virginia statutes anticipate and encompassed under the wiretapping is really
[01:35:10.234 --> 01:35:18.059]  Also a prohibition against somebody dropping a pocket recorder in a room of other people and them walking out and intercepting oral communication.
[01:35:18.059 --> 01:35:36.851]  That all is kind of encompassed under the wiretapping statute, but wiretapping is taking someone else's communications, either cell phone or landline or, like I said, even face-to-face communication, and then somehow intercepting that, but it doesn't prohibit
[01:35:37.654 --> 01:36:01.473]  Recording a call that you're a party to, neither does it prohibit, if you and I are having this conversation privately, and Joe Investigator says, hey, actually I'm having a conversation with you, and you've told Joe Investigator, hey, you can record this conversation, even though he's not a party to it, he can record it because he has the consent of at least one of us.
[01:36:01.473 --> 01:36:04.055]  So that would be permissible under Virginia law.
[01:36:04.055 --> 01:36:07.038]  The interesting part about how it breaks down is if
[01:36:08.326 --> 01:36:26.872]  I'm talking to, let's say, my wife, and she and I are in a heated battle, and we're going into custody proceedings, and I record her, a conversation with her, and she says, you'll never see the kids again, and then I try to use that recording in the domestic proceedings.
[01:36:26.872 --> 01:36:32.993]  I cannot do that unless I have told her at the outset of the conversation that I am recording her.
[01:36:32.993 --> 01:36:34.834]  I have to put her on notice of that.
[01:36:35.427 --> 01:36:56.908]  Now, that same prohibition doesn't exist where if I am recording the conversation and she says, oh yeah, you're never going to see the kids again because I'm going to get a gun and I'm going to shoot you and kill you, now she's made a threat over the telephone, which is obviously a criminal offense, and I can use that recording in a criminal proceeding even though she didn't have notice of it.
[01:36:57.492 --> 01:36:57.632]  So
[01:37:13.769 --> 01:37:18.591]  From what I've studied, can't get in trouble for doing that because I'm in a public place.
[01:37:18.591 --> 01:37:29.716]  But if I go put a recorder over my back neighbor's fence and try to record him on his property, that would be some type of eavesdropping or wiretapping offense in most states.
[01:37:29.716 --> 01:37:31.477]  Right, that's probably true.
[01:37:31.477 --> 01:37:36.059]  Usually what you do in public, you subject yourself to free game.
[01:37:36.059 --> 01:37:42.442]  Now there are obviously some statutes that are on the books to address issues of peeping and that kind of stuff.
[01:37:44.077 --> 01:37:56.627]  A lady walking through the shopping mall in a mini-skirt, you know, even though she's in public, there are specific statutes that says, hey, don't use your toe mirrors and don't use your little pocket cameras to try to shoot up.
[01:37:56.627 --> 01:37:59.349]  Yeah, because that's going into her private space.
[01:37:59.349 --> 01:38:12.459]  Now, expanding on that, and I want to get back into the cell phones themselves, we see all these videos and news articles from all over the nation where somebody will videotape the police, even from their own front yard, or have surveillance cameras on their house.
[01:38:13.362 --> 01:38:26.971]  And then when people try to use that against the police, there's been cases of police coming and arresting them, saying that that was wiretapping, which is ridiculous because, again, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy out in the open air.
[01:38:26.971 --> 01:38:32.335]  And I've had police walk up to me around the nation and say, turn your cameras off, you don't have permission, when I'm on a city street.
[01:38:32.335 --> 01:38:39.980]  Well, they don't have any expectation of privacy, and that's all been litigated out in court, and the police have lost in every case, but they don't care.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:43.282]  They continue all across the nation to claim you don't have a right to videotape them.
[01:38:45.123 --> 01:39:02.568]  Yeah, you know, and I've not been involved in any of those civil disputes that result from somebody, you know, kind of the Rodney King, Reginald Denny type recordings that I guess probably some of the forerunners of this very popular taping of these public incidents, especially those that involve the police.
[01:39:02.568 --> 01:39:05.449]  I've never had the opportunity to litigate that in the civil arena.
[01:39:06.104 --> 01:39:14.589]  Well, I just know that, let's say I go down to get some crowd shots on New Year's for a documentary I'm making of what crowds think about, say, Barack Obama.
[01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:17.570]  I was just doing that last week as I'm making a film about him.
[01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:26.576]  And I, you know, we'll always have a few aggressive nuts, or people who don't like me, come up and say, hey, you don't have permission to be videotaping me when I'm shooting crowds of people.
[01:39:26.576 --> 01:39:30.698]  And I say, listen, you're walking down a public street in the middle of the music district
[01:39:31.118 --> 01:39:33.579]  You do not have any privacy.
[01:39:33.579 --> 01:39:34.160]  I'm sorry.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.181]  And that's what the news does under newsgathering.
[01:39:37.181 --> 01:39:44.806]  If I'm making an entertainment film, I would have to get each and every person, in some circumstances, to sign a waiver form.
[01:39:44.806 --> 01:39:48.028]  But if I'm doing newsgathering or First Amendment, I'm protected.
[01:39:48.028 --> 01:39:48.948]  Right.
[01:39:48.948 --> 01:39:50.549]  And that is my understanding of it as well.
[01:39:50.549 --> 01:39:55.212]  And I know it gets somewhat gray and a little bit more complicated.
[01:39:55.212 --> 01:39:59.274]  And you touched on this when you said if you're going to use it for entertainment value.
[01:39:59.741 --> 01:40:12.184]  But if you were going to take that person's likeness and somehow use it for marketing purposes or something that would be for pecuniary gain, then you would obviously have a problem with using their image without their consent.
[01:40:12.184 --> 01:40:22.106]  But as you say, they're on a public street and you're filming a documentary or you got your cameras rolling because you just enjoy filming crowds like you're instead of a bird watcher, you're a crowd watcher.
[01:40:22.106 --> 01:40:24.427]  I don't think there's any prohibition against it.
[01:40:24.427 --> 01:40:25.327]  No, there's clearly not.
[01:40:27.665 --> 01:40:39.893]  In the time we have left with you, specifically getting back to the cell phones, without getting into any attorney-client privilege, cases you've looked at, cases you've studied, I mean, how does this normally transpire?
[01:40:39.893 --> 01:40:44.256]  A husband wants to spy on his wife, or vice versa, he goes and downloads the software.
[01:40:44.256 --> 01:40:45.497]  How does this work?
[01:40:45.497 --> 01:40:49.859]  Well, it's done in a number of different formats with the domestic relations law.
[01:40:50.993 --> 01:40:53.075]  That's a cell phone based system again.
[01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:16.451]  It may very well be a cell phone based system.
[01:41:16.451 --> 01:41:17.432]  Or a wireless internet.
[01:41:17.432 --> 01:41:18.413]  Wireless, yeah.
[01:41:18.413 --> 01:41:19.513]  Right.
[01:41:19.513 --> 01:41:22.095]  So that's somewhat common in these.
[01:41:22.095 --> 01:41:36.325]  The other thing that I've had come up a number of times is where somebody has done the pocket recorder press play and record and waited for that phone call to be made or they've waited for the visitor to come to the house and that has come up before.
[01:41:36.325 --> 01:41:38.907]  The other thing that I have and I have in my office right now
[01:41:39.648 --> 01:41:58.643]  Um, is a small, very, um, just innocuous looking speaker with, uh, just your classic black felt front, which basically, if you can picture this about the size of somebody using a hole punch to, uh, punch a hole right in the middle of it, doesn't, you know, it doesn't even stand out until you get right on top of it.
[01:41:58.643 --> 01:42:02.827]  And inserted into that was a, um, uh, a small camera.
[01:42:02.827 --> 01:42:04.328]  And this guy was recording his wife.
[01:42:04.944 --> 01:42:20.970]  Literally for hours upon in in the house and in any place one in the bathroom and and all kinds of stuff So those are the more common Areas that that you're that you see yeah, I'm learning camps Yeah, right exactly, but of course in this case.
[01:42:20.970 --> 01:42:22.831]  You know that lady had no idea.
[01:42:22.831 --> 01:42:28.373]  She was being Recorded the other thing that that comes up quite frequently, and it's a little bit
[01:42:28.891 --> 01:42:36.593]  Frustrating for the domestic practitioner is that people say and do all kinds of stuff on their cell phones these days.
[01:42:36.593 --> 01:42:42.114]  They send text messages or they send pictures or streaming videos of themselves or whatever the case may be.
[01:42:42.114 --> 01:42:57.058]  And many times they're very damning from an evidentiary standpoint and for us to try to get our hands on those can be difficult because of the cellular company's reliance on some of these wiretapping laws and where you could usually issue a subpoena ducus tecum to
[01:42:57.665 --> 01:43:00.066]  Get the documentation sent to your office.
[01:43:00.066 --> 01:43:13.754]  Now they want you to have to go through court order and they rely upon these statutes which are really designed to assist the law enforcement officials and it can be very difficult to get your hands on those sorts of things.
[01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:20.777]  So not only is there more surveillance going on but they're making it harder for the general public to get access to it.
[01:43:20.777 --> 01:43:21.938]  That's exactly right.
[01:43:21.938 --> 01:43:24.519]  Alright, specifically with the cell phones
[01:43:28.687 --> 01:43:41.556]  A case point example of how someone is listening to their wife or listening to their neighbor, or if they find out, say, the cell phone number of Alex Jones, how they would surveil that?
[01:43:41.556 --> 01:43:50.782]  Well, you know, that piece that you probably showed earlier on your show where that software gets downloaded, and once that happens, it's as if the person's riding around with a live mic in their pocket.
[01:43:50.782 --> 01:43:57.827]  And, you know, I have not had either a criminal client who has been charged with
[01:43:58.374 --> 01:44:04.556]  That violation of the wiretapping, neither have I, at least at this point, as any of my domestic clients.
[01:44:04.556 --> 01:44:07.137]  But the point of the piece is, we know it's widespread.
[01:44:07.137 --> 01:44:08.017]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:44:08.017 --> 01:44:09.177]  Yeah, no, that's fine.
[01:44:09.177 --> 01:44:11.558]  You're right, it is widespread.
[01:44:11.558 --> 01:44:21.121]  But as far as people in this office who know that they have been subjected to it, the discoveries that my clients have made have been the ones that I outlined to you before.
[01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:25.022]  But, you know, of course, we know it's out there, and you suspect that
[01:44:25.683 --> 01:44:35.790]  Uh, you know, your clients will come in and report to you, listen, you know, he said XYZ and the only way he'd have known that is if he would have somehow heard this or, you know, heard me say that to this person.
[01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:41.134]  The only time I've mentioned that particular fact is when I spoke to such and such, you know, or whatever.
[01:44:41.134 --> 01:44:51.902]  And it's a case where clearly the only mechanism that the person could have used to obtain that information was to somehow have eavesdropped on a telephone call used by the cell phone.
[01:44:52.711 --> 01:45:20.800]  Now the bigger issue here, and I'd like to get your take on this, and this isn't your particular area of expertise or practice, but I do want your view on it, Mr. Plumlee, and that is the federal government by law had this engineered into all phones, and then that opened up the Pandora's box for not just the NSA, the FBI, and every other alphabet agency, or out-of-control agents within those agencies, rogue agents to be surveilling people, but now this technology is out to the public and is rampantly being discovered.
[01:45:23.174 --> 01:45:24.054]  You know, it's interesting.
[01:45:24.054 --> 01:45:30.817]  It's the whole, you know, I guess balancing act between, you know, what's necessary for national security.
[01:45:30.817 --> 01:45:36.119]  And of course, 9-11 has changed quite a bit of the mindset of this country probably as a whole.
[01:45:36.119 --> 01:45:40.001]  And everybody was, you know, this area was big on jet noise.
[01:45:40.001 --> 01:45:48.164]  You know, Virginia Beach, there was a lot of stuff in the media about, you know, how annoying and frustrating the jet noise was.
[01:45:48.164 --> 01:45:50.786]  And it was, there was a diminution in their property values.
[01:45:50.786 --> 01:45:51.126]  And then 9-11 came.
[01:45:52.432 --> 01:45:55.814]  Literally, there were bumper stickers that said, we love jet noise.
[01:45:55.814 --> 01:46:03.520]  Because suddenly now, our country was coming to protect us from all these things.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:10.785]  And so there's been obviously a shifting in the mentality over the years of how much is too much of the big brothering going on.
[01:46:10.785 --> 01:46:22.113]  So unfortunately, as technology evolves, and you're going to have statutes in place which are, at least in theory, for national security and other investigative purposes, which are going to be abused,
[01:46:22.842 --> 01:46:37.006]  And, you know, depending on what your focus is, because for every one of the frustration violations of our civil liberties that we may see, there may be 10 areas where there was some chaos or catastrophe avoided because of information.
[01:46:37.006 --> 01:46:41.507]  So it just depends on what perspective and what focus you want to maintain.
[01:46:41.507 --> 01:46:46.489]  But we now know that the whole NSA system has been used for the NSA to sit around listening to phone sex.
[01:46:46.489 --> 01:46:50.630]  I mean, they've had agents on TV, on ABC News, admitting this is going on.
[01:46:51.115 --> 01:46:51.915]  Right.
[01:46:51.915 --> 01:46:55.797]  And you're not going to find, I don't think, too many people to say, yeah, that's cool.
[01:46:55.797 --> 01:46:57.498]  Yeah, go ahead and do that.
[01:46:57.498 --> 01:47:00.259]  And that is obviously a violation of your rights.
[01:47:00.259 --> 01:47:13.086]  And it's very frustrating that they're the guys who, obviously, the statutes are in the books to assist with certain other investigative needs, and they're the ones that are abusing it.
[01:47:13.086 --> 01:47:15.767]  And I don't think you're going to find anybody to say that, yeah, they're OK with that.
[01:47:18.356 --> 01:47:25.864]  Well, separately, when you've been part of that particular TV production and when you've talked about this to the media in the past,
[01:47:26.889 --> 01:47:28.951]  Is this shocking to your clients?
[01:47:28.951 --> 01:47:38.037]  Is this shocking to the public to learn that so many of these platforms have had surveillance backbones engineered into them?
[01:47:38.037 --> 01:47:50.266]  I mean, the Feds engineered the phones, by law, or ordered the companies to, to where they can dial in, or anybody else can for that matter, when the phone is turned off and use it as a bugging device.
[01:47:50.266 --> 01:47:52.328]  Well, there's certainly a shock
[01:47:54.084 --> 01:48:02.607]  I guess the shock kind of goes on two major levels, and then there's obviously probably information that they still don't realize.
[01:48:02.607 --> 01:48:11.931]  And the one shock is obviously, and the one that is the most prevalent, is when the person has obviously been surveilled without their knowledge.
[01:48:11.931 --> 01:48:17.953]  And that obviously trumps everything, because when it's personal to you, that emotion takes over.
[01:48:17.953 --> 01:48:19.594]  So that's the predominant one.
[01:48:21.286 --> 01:48:28.031]  Is that I think people continue to somehow be surprised by technology and that it has the capability to do all these things.
[01:48:28.031 --> 01:48:41.961]  The piece I did for the local guys here was that was their focus was it was just kind of a they were awestruck that a simple cell phone that had been left unattended for 10 minutes could have been turned into such a surveillance device.
[01:48:41.961 --> 01:48:46.985]  I don't think that people generally speaking just your just your average Joe on the street
[01:48:47.535 --> 01:48:57.800]  Realizes that some of the backbone and some of the sophisticated technology inside the phone was actually put there at the government's urging.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:02.362]  And so, yeah, there's no question that's going to bring about a different level of shock.
[01:49:02.362 --> 01:49:05.384]  All right, Attorney Eric Plumlee, do one more segment with us.
[01:49:05.384 --> 01:49:06.885]  We're going to come back in three minutes.
[01:49:06.885 --> 01:49:14.789]  I want to bring up some other platforms that are being used and get your legal opinion on that.
[01:49:14.789 --> 01:49:15.209]  Stay with us.
[01:49:18.872 --> 01:49:21.794]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[01:49:21.794 --> 01:49:25.015]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[01:49:25.015 --> 01:49:26.756]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[01:49:26.756 --> 01:49:30.058]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[01:49:30.058 --> 01:49:32.819]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[01:49:32.819 --> 01:49:33.660]  To stay free.
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:38.383]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[01:49:38.383 --> 01:49:41.765]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[01:49:41.765 --> 01:49:44.627]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[01:49:44.627 --> 01:49:49.270]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:52.392]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[01:49:52.392 --> 01:49:58.476]  Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money.
[01:49:58.476 --> 01:50:01.598]  Selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[01:50:01.598 --> 01:50:03.079]  Restaurants and small delis.
[01:50:03.079 --> 01:50:04.280]  Don't buy from copycats.
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:08.943]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:50:08.943 --> 01:50:10.724]  And we knew what to do.
[01:50:10.724 --> 01:50:12.685]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:50:12.685 --> 01:50:13.066]  Whitman!
[01:50:34.364 --> 01:50:41.687]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:50:41.687 --> 01:50:48.791]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:50:48.791 --> 01:50:51.972]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:50:51.972 --> 01:50:57.735]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:50:57.735 --> 01:51:00.276]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:51:00.814 --> 01:51:06.862]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[01:51:09.786 --> 01:51:14.692]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:51:16.371 --> 01:51:19.612]  Every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed.
[01:51:19.612 --> 01:51:21.933]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:51:21.933 --> 01:51:25.555]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:51:25.555 --> 01:51:26.495]  Be smart.
[01:51:26.495 --> 01:51:27.476]  Be safe.
[01:51:27.476 --> 01:51:29.657]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:52:35.208 --> 01:52:50.353]  We're talking to attorney Eric Plumlee and we really appreciate him coming on to talk about just kind of at the ground legal level of dealing with all of this new emerging technology and the proliferation of surveillance systems by governments, corporations, families, private individuals, companies.
[01:52:51.730 --> 01:52:55.431]  In closing, sir, I've been on the air for 13 years.
[01:52:55.431 --> 01:53:01.613]  I remember about 12 years ago, I had a Time Warner installer at my house, and he happened to be one of their sub-engineers.
[01:53:01.613 --> 01:53:03.353]  He wasn't just a cable guy.
[01:53:03.353 --> 01:53:13.255]  He was there overseeing a crew, and he was aware that I was exposing kind of the Big Brother situation, and he said, hey, do you see this Scientific Atlantic cable box?
[01:53:13.255 --> 01:53:14.636]  See that microphone built into it?
[01:53:15.416 --> 01:53:24.824]  And he said, these new digital cable boxes, everything you do, everything you watch is put in a psychological algorithm, and that data can then be sold and used.
[01:53:24.824 --> 01:53:31.250]  So I did more research on it and found out it was true, and it was years until people started actually using those microphones for their own applications.
[01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:37.055]  Now all the new computers have cameras and microphones, and two years ago Google announced, they said, hey,
[01:53:41.499 --> 01:53:56.964]  We're going to use the camera and the microphone built in on the computers with a new software to listen to everything going on in your home or to watch you and say we hear a dog barking we'll know to put ads up in front of you with cookies on the screen you're looking at for dog food.
[01:53:56.964 --> 01:54:04.246]  And they said, but we get around violating the Fourth Amendment because this is a computer listening, which is asinine, and then it creates
[01:54:05.333 --> 01:54:07.595]  A text of all the audio.
[01:54:07.595 --> 01:54:09.816]  It's NSA-type technology.
[01:54:09.816 --> 01:54:10.797]  A, were you aware of that?
[01:54:10.797 --> 01:54:13.558]  And then B, what are the legal ramifications of that?
[01:54:13.558 --> 01:54:15.780]  No one's even discussing it.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:32.731]  Well, no, I guess I'm one of the average Joes who finds myself kind of awestruck by the, and again, I don't know why, but awestruck by the technology that exists that they can do these things with seemingly innocent pieces of equipment that have been installed in your home.
[01:54:32.731 --> 01:54:34.172]  No, I had heard
[01:54:34.767 --> 01:54:42.670]  That there were certain things that could happen through the cable box, as far as video or audio surveillance and how that is communicated.
[01:54:42.670 --> 01:54:52.454]  You know, it's kind of like when you go to the grocery store and you buy one thing and all of a sudden on the back of your receipt it prints out a coupon for a competing brand of whatever it is that you just purchased.
[01:54:52.454 --> 01:54:55.595]  So that kind of stuff, I guess, going on through your cable box.
[01:54:55.595 --> 01:54:59.897]  But I think that the wiretapping laws, and again in Virginia,
[01:55:00.521 --> 01:55:02.624]  Address that sort of conduct.
[01:55:02.624 --> 01:55:13.878]  Cox Cable is our big provider around here, but if you have somebody that comes in and he installs a box for the purpose of listening in on you or surveilling you, he's in violation.
[01:55:13.878 --> 01:55:15.801]  It's a felonious act in Virginia.
[01:55:17.981 --> 01:55:19.141]  But that's my whole point.
[01:55:19.141 --> 01:55:22.423]  Institutionalized, well, here's a case point example.
[01:55:22.423 --> 01:55:30.326]  Chicago Tribune, Super Bowl three years ago, Janet Jackson, wardrobe malfunction with her breast, staged event.
[01:55:30.326 --> 01:55:33.067]  She has it all dolled up, a little sun symbol.
[01:55:33.067 --> 01:55:37.709]  And Tevo brags, we had 2.2 million rewinds and replays within ten minutes.
[01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:45.151]  And the Chicago Tribune said, and we already knew about this, people wouldn't believe us, they said, well, how did you know how people rewound and replayed across the nation?
[01:55:45.151 --> 01:55:46.252]  Well, it's a two-way system.
[01:55:47.085 --> 01:55:55.151]  And so right there, I mean, I went and looked at the terms and conditions of the cable contract.
[01:55:55.151 --> 01:55:56.732]  It doesn't say they're doing this in there.
[01:55:56.732 --> 01:56:01.435]  So I think this is some serious, serious lawsuits in all of this.
[01:56:01.435 --> 01:56:02.836]  I would not disagree with you.
[01:56:02.836 --> 01:56:15.185]  I mean, it's interesting that you went and looked at that because that's where many times you would find that loophole to allow them to be able to monitor all your activity in your home is that when they install the box and you agree to
[01:56:15.806 --> 01:56:23.430]  Uh, to use this within our terms, and then the terms, which, you know, you need a microscope to read, say that, you know, we can, we can do certain things.
[01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:32.415]  We can listen, we can watch, we can record, and, um, you know, use these things to, to sell to, uh, companies so that they can market you, uh, more effectively.
[01:56:32.415 --> 01:56:33.676]  So, yeah, you're right.
[01:56:33.676 --> 01:56:39.979]  And without that sort of, uh, consent or notice being given, then, um, you know, obviously a violation.
[01:56:40.675 --> 01:56:44.718]  All right, well, we appreciate your input on that and your perspective.
[01:56:44.718 --> 01:56:48.100]  Attorney Eric Plumlee, there in Virginia, take care, sir.
[01:56:48.100 --> 01:56:49.181]  Have a good New Year.
[01:56:49.181 --> 01:56:49.521]  Thank you.
[01:56:49.521 --> 01:56:49.861]  You too.
[01:56:49.861 --> 01:56:50.882]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:56:50.882 --> 01:56:51.202]  You bet.
[01:56:51.202 --> 01:56:51.642]  Take care.
[01:56:51.642 --> 01:56:56.646]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:56.646 --> 01:57:02.529]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:02.529 --> 01:57:04.651]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:07.096 --> 01:57:13.860]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:16.502]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:57:16.502 --> 01:57:18.063]  But who is the enemy?
[01:57:18.063 --> 01:57:18.863]  Bin Laden.
[01:57:18.863 --> 01:57:19.804]  This is his M.O.s.
[01:57:19.804 --> 01:57:21.245]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:57:21.245 --> 01:57:23.226]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:57:23.226 --> 01:57:30.370]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:30.850]  Some U.S.
[01:57:30.850 --> 01:57:36.514]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:57:37.194 --> 01:57:40.695]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:57:40.695 --> 01:57:43.496]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:58:09.443 --> 01:58:11.845]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:58:11.845 --> 01:58:21.271]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:21.271 --> 01:58:22.571]  Big Brother.
[01:58:22.571 --> 01:58:24.352]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:24.352 --> 01:58:26.114]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:26.114 --> 01:58:27.675]  You want answers?
[01:58:27.675 --> 01:58:29.236]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:29.236 --> 01:58:33.418]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:33.418 --> 01:58:37.501]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:41.016 --> 01:58:42.317]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:42.317 --> 01:58:42.797]  Welcome.
[01:58:42.797 --> 01:58:47.560]  We are now into hour number three already today.
[01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:51.002]  We'll be live simulcasting the radio show for the next two hours.
[01:58:51.002 --> 01:58:53.604]  The radio show is live 11 a.m.
[01:58:53.604 --> 01:58:54.124]  to 3 p.m.
[01:58:54.124 --> 01:58:55.265]  Central Standard Time.
[01:58:55.265 --> 01:58:58.647]  And then the second and third hour every day we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:58.647 --> 01:59:00.188]  Some days we do three or four hours.
[01:59:00.188 --> 01:59:05.131]  Sometimes the whole show is live and we have a lot of guests that are on that want to take part in the TV show.
[01:59:05.911 --> 01:59:18.717]  We just talked earlier to Attorney Eric Plumlee about your cable boxes, your cell phones, all tracking, tracing everything you go, everywhere you go, what you do, tuning in, listening to you, tracking your every move.
[01:59:18.717 --> 01:59:23.719]  Ray McGovern, Chief CIA Briefer to Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[01:59:23.719 --> 01:59:28.801]  will be joining us to talk about a host of geopolitical issues, including what's happening right now in Gaza.
[01:59:28.801 --> 01:59:35.024]  The Israelis have now been invading some of the three major cities, including areas, suburbs of Gaza City,
[01:59:35.504 --> 01:59:35.765]  We're good.
[01:59:50.686 --> 01:59:57.532]  Police narcotics investigator Barry Cooper in here exposing the police state and how the police violate the law.
[01:59:57.532 --> 02:00:02.297]  He's been running stings against police around the country and making international headlines with that.
[02:00:02.297 --> 02:00:04.279]  His website is NeverGetBusted.com.
[02:00:04.279 --> 02:00:08.282]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:08.282 --> 02:00:12.026]  But first, when we get back in the next segment,
[02:00:12.895 --> 02:00:26.446]  I'm going to get into what happened with the shooting in California last Friday on New Year's Day of the African-American man who was killed execution style by the police.
[02:00:26.446 --> 02:00:28.727]  Now, I waited a few days to comment on this.
[02:00:28.727 --> 02:00:29.628]  People were wanting me to comment.
[02:00:29.628 --> 02:00:31.109]  I had to study the case.
[02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:33.471]  Now we know what happened, pretty much.
[02:00:33.471 --> 02:00:38.535]  And it is a police cover-up and police deception, and we're going to be going over that coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:38.535 --> 02:00:40.476]  But before I get to that, look at this!
[02:00:41.434 --> 02:00:43.195]  Right here.
[02:00:43.195 --> 02:01:01.280]  Last night, I noticed that the Horizon Milk that we had at our house, who previously had a message about how they don't have bovine growth hormone or other hormones or antibiotics used on their cattle, which are then transferred to human beings, I noticed that it changed.
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:08.762]  It said, our farms produce this milk without antibiotics, added hormones, pesticides, or cloning.
[02:01:09.582 --> 02:01:11.423]  Cloning, right there!
[02:01:11.423 --> 02:01:21.969]  And for those that aren't watching at PrisonPlanet.TV, it's a classic red and white paper half gallon of milk.
[02:01:23.772 --> 02:01:28.374]  And it's the popular brand of organic milk that I first saw appear about eight years ago.
[02:01:28.374 --> 02:01:33.656]  I've been using it that long and one of the most popular brands nationwide.
[02:01:33.656 --> 02:01:36.858]  And there is the USDA organic seal that they have.
[02:01:36.858 --> 02:01:44.821]  And it says, our farms produce this milk without antibiotics, added hormones, pesticides, or cloning.
[02:01:44.821 --> 02:01:49.283]  And I raise this point here because every time I talk about how there are giant dairy
[02:01:50.327 --> 02:02:17.527]  Herds especially, that are from cloned animals, or the offspring of cloned animals, these genetic freaks with hormones to produce triple the amount of milk, and then they're genetic freaks that produce even more, that in the cloning process, a lot of other changes happen to the animal, and these are cross-species animals, they've added insect, plant, genes, other things into their DNA, that that has a lot of spin-off effects and alters the viral
[02:02:18.968 --> 02:02:26.811]  Blooms, bacterial activity in the animals, and also has some connections to cancer.
[02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:40.916]  Many GMO foods, of course, in studies show cause cancer because it creates new, well it's a whole host of things, ring structures, new types of amino acids that never existed before.
[02:02:42.102 --> 02:02:48.166]  In cases they'll feed GMO potatoes to rats and most of the rats die or they're sterile.
[02:02:48.166 --> 02:02:49.607]  I mean the same thing over and over again.
[02:02:49.607 --> 02:02:56.752]  Well now it's not just soybeans or potatoes or corn, it's the very animals we're eating or the milk from those animals that we're drinking.
[02:02:56.752 --> 02:03:05.458]  But the public can't even address this or deal with it because they send me emails saying I'm crazy, we're not eating cloned cows, we're not drinking milk from cloned cows.
[02:03:05.458 --> 02:03:06.678]  Yes we are.
[02:03:06.678 --> 02:03:11.402]  To the point of the milk companies that are organic have to tell you that there's no cloning.
[02:03:12.262 --> 02:03:13.463]  Comprende?
[02:03:13.463 --> 02:03:14.323]  So there you have it.
[02:03:14.323 --> 02:03:17.185]  We are living in a Buck Rogers age.
[02:03:17.185 --> 02:03:18.866]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:18.866 --> 02:03:23.609]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever.
[02:03:23.609 --> 02:03:26.571]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[02:03:26.571 --> 02:03:29.633]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:03:29.633 --> 02:03:31.114]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome
[02:03:31.314 --> 02:03:35.759]  And begged for FEMA to take care of your family, in any emergency, if you simply prepare.
[02:03:35.759 --> 02:03:41.545]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout with a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[02:03:41.545 --> 02:03:43.387]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[02:03:43.387 --> 02:03:47.351]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[02:03:47.351 --> 02:03:49.794]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[02:03:50.154 --> 02:03:59.306]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[02:03:59.306 --> 02:04:06.395]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[02:04:06.395 --> 02:04:08.398]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast,
[02:04:08.618 --> 02:04:10.840]  There seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:16.524]  The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[02:04:16.524 --> 02:04:19.766]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business.
[02:04:19.766 --> 02:04:23.129]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[02:04:23.129 --> 02:04:24.950]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:28.653]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[02:04:29.013 --> 02:04:33.155]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[02:04:33.155 --> 02:04:40.678]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[02:04:40.678 --> 02:04:44.620]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:47.841]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:04:47.841 --> 02:04:54.724]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:04:54.844 --> 02:04:58.105]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:04:58.105 --> 02:05:03.267]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:05:34.518 --> 02:05:36.079]  You want answers?
[02:05:36.079 --> 02:05:37.640]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:41.842]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:41.842 --> 02:05:49.245]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:05:49.245 --> 02:05:51.786]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:51.786 --> 02:05:55.168]  Ray McGovern coming up in about 22 minutes from now.
[02:05:59.724 --> 02:06:03.102]  Living here in Austin, Texas, we have had...
[02:06:04.349 --> 02:06:24.363]  Four cases I can remember in the last few years of police shooting someone who's handcuffed or someone who is unarmed on the ground or, well there are actually more than four cases, several cases of mentally retarded homeless people or one guy was out of a mental institution and ran from the police so they gunned him down.
[02:06:24.363 --> 02:06:31.589]  And there's other cases that are questionable where you'll have a mentally ill person waving a stick at police so they just shoot him 20 feet away.
[02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:32.850]  Very cowardly behavior.
[02:06:33.650 --> 02:06:47.442]  And I'm not here to bash the police in whole, but when you have police going from being peace officers, culturally, to being paramilitary forces that are militarily trained, and even trained with the military, it's an us against them.
[02:06:47.442 --> 02:07:00.374]  It's no longer a guardian position, and they still have that remnants of that, vestigial elements of that, to a certain point, but they're transferring more and more over to this continuum of force
[02:07:02.049 --> 02:07:26.348]  uh... system where they've got to be in control of the situation and if somebody gets out of control in any way uh... they they use me a maximum force uh... against these individuals with a zero tolerance policy in the name of their safety and i've seen the statistics and numbers that hasn't made police safer in fact police if you're so scared of everything you should know the number one cause of death for you is automobile accidents and uh...
[02:07:27.108 --> 02:07:31.291]  That's car wrecks, but then within that group it's also hanging your butts out on the highway writing tickets.
[02:07:31.291 --> 02:07:34.973]  I mean, you guys and gals have got some courage.
[02:07:34.973 --> 02:07:43.539]  I mean, I know what's dangerous, and that's why when I get pulled over, I pull over in the grass hoping he won't or she won't be sticking their butt out in the middle of the highway here.
[02:07:43.539 --> 02:07:46.902]  Cops get killed every day in this country getting run over.
[02:07:46.902 --> 02:07:53.366]  So you're all freaking out and scared and pulling guns out on us for almost no reason, like you're in a war zone.
[02:07:53.366 --> 02:07:55.728]  I mean, I see police coming up at
[02:07:56.493 --> 02:08:02.276]  When they pull somebody over with their hand on their gun to an old lady driving a convertible.
[02:08:02.276 --> 02:08:12.621]  I've had a cop pull me over before and I had a weight belt in the front seat and he pulled his gun out and stuck it to my head and then freaked out and luckily didn't blow up even more when he was wrong.
[02:08:15.563 --> 02:08:17.805]  He said, okay, sorry, just don't speed, get out of here.
[02:08:17.805 --> 02:08:23.648]  But needless to say, I had sweat running down my brow from five seconds of him with that gun.
[02:08:23.648 --> 02:08:27.231]  And he said, I thought it was a big knife scabbard or gun belt.
[02:08:27.231 --> 02:08:30.993]  I'm just like, no, man, it's a weight belt.
[02:08:30.993 --> 02:08:33.035]  It's right there.
[02:08:33.035 --> 02:08:43.622]  But if he would have put a hole in my head, they tell police in the academy, wink, wink, when they're in the locker room, and I've talked to a lot of police who have told me this and it's come out in court cases, to carry a throwaway gun.
[02:08:44.633 --> 02:08:46.034]  You know, a stinger.
[02:08:46.034 --> 02:08:56.121]  To carry a little derringer or something they can throw at the scene that they got at a gun show or something so there's no record of it, you know, through a private sale so they can set you up.
[02:08:56.121 --> 02:09:03.727]  And they say, well, we've got to do that because it's tough out there and we're going to make mistakes and, you know, we've got to do this to protect our officers and it's just something we do.
[02:09:03.727 --> 02:09:13.514]  See, that's how the culture of corruption begins where they incrementally, you know, do these things in the name of the greater good, but it's not.
[02:09:16.468 --> 02:09:18.249]  And I'm not here to even bash the police.
[02:09:18.249 --> 02:09:25.314]  I understand they're being federalized, they're being brainwashed, they're being slowly twisted into accepting tyranny and corruption.
[02:09:25.314 --> 02:09:28.497]  But I am here to point out that we have the Justice Department's own numbers.
[02:09:28.497 --> 02:09:32.640]  Police shootings are going way up nationwide of citizens.
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:35.482]  And more and more of those are questionable or outright executions.
[02:09:35.482 --> 02:09:39.765]  Remember a few years ago the famous case of the off-duty cop.
[02:09:40.785 --> 02:09:50.659]  and the cop pulls him over says get out of the car and pulls his gun out on the guys begging saying please please please don't shoot me I'm not a threat and they shoot him.
[02:09:51.570 --> 02:09:52.791]  Several times.
[02:09:52.791 --> 02:09:53.532]  Was it three times?
[02:09:53.532 --> 02:09:56.335]  And then there's the famous case of the NFL football player.
[02:09:56.335 --> 02:09:57.256]  Cops are yelling at him.
[02:09:57.256 --> 02:09:58.917]  He's going, what's wrong?
[02:09:58.917 --> 02:09:59.798]  He's totally calm.
[02:09:59.798 --> 02:10:02.320]  He's going, officer, officer, everything's okay.
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:04.162]  And he goes, don't you make a fist at me.
[02:10:04.162 --> 02:10:06.445]  He goes, I'm not making a fist, sir.
[02:10:06.445 --> 02:10:07.766]  And he pulls his hands back and goes like that.
[02:10:07.766 --> 02:10:09.087]  He goes, you're making a fist again.
[02:10:09.087 --> 02:10:12.030]  So the cops start shoving him and he goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, man.
[02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.851]  So they taser him.
[02:10:14.028 --> 02:10:18.273]  And clearly he's supplicating, he's okay.
[02:10:18.273 --> 02:10:24.720]  This is international sign with their hands out, open palms facing that, hey, no problem.
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:26.421]  That's the natural hands up.
[02:10:26.421 --> 02:10:28.884]  This is not the natural hands up.
[02:10:28.884 --> 02:10:31.147]  The natural hands up is, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's, you know, okay.
[02:10:32.947 --> 02:10:37.369]  So, last Friday, everybody's like, another police shooting in California.
[02:10:37.369 --> 02:10:40.291]  And we have video of the BART cop execution.
[02:10:40.291 --> 02:10:42.532]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:42.532 --> 02:10:48.895]  Now, another video has come out, shot further down the platform.
[02:10:48.895 --> 02:10:59.820]  The first video that came out, Monday night, was another train pulling in, as you see the young males sitting on
[02:11:00.851 --> 02:11:12.079]  Their hind ends up against a wall, and they've got their hands in their lap, and the police are yelling and screaming and freaking out, and you can see that the young men are calm.
[02:11:12.079 --> 02:11:14.261]  And they're submitting.
[02:11:14.261 --> 02:11:16.502]  They don't have their hands out extended.
[02:11:16.502 --> 02:11:18.344]  They're going, okay, okay, okay.
[02:11:18.344 --> 02:11:21.906]  And the police are clearly saying, get up, turn around, I'll put you in cuffs.
[02:11:21.906 --> 02:11:23.327]  So one of the guys starts getting up.
[02:11:23.327 --> 02:11:25.149]  He puts his hands behind his back.
[02:11:26.821 --> 02:11:30.524]  And the police decide to go ahead and slam his head down on the ground and jump on his neck.
[02:11:30.524 --> 02:11:34.766]  A lot of times people's necks get broken by this, and the cops just make excuses.
[02:11:34.766 --> 02:11:44.853]  So they jump on his neck, they're all piling on him, and they start going for the other guy, and witnesses reported that he said, hey don't hurt me, I've got a young daughter, I'm submitting, I'm cool.
[02:11:44.853 --> 02:11:51.658]  And you can see his face, he's going, come on, come on, everything's alright, he's got his hands out, like in the international symbol of, okay, okay.
[02:11:52.518 --> 02:11:57.681]  And they grab him, and they slam him down like the other guy, and he's not resisting.
[02:11:57.681 --> 02:12:03.364]  He's just laying there, and the cop pulls his gun out, aims it right at the back of him, and shoots him in the back.
[02:12:03.364 --> 02:12:06.066]  It goes through.
[02:12:06.066 --> 02:12:08.888]  They shot him right below the neck, right in the middle of the upper back.
[02:12:09.668 --> 02:12:10.129]  We're good to go.
[02:12:27.546 --> 02:12:29.667]  That memory is just, you know, there.
[02:12:29.667 --> 02:12:32.527]  I'm there with my parents.
[02:12:32.527 --> 02:12:34.248]  I'm there with my childhood friend.
[02:12:34.248 --> 02:12:35.488]  You know, his mom's there.
[02:12:35.488 --> 02:12:38.188]  His dad was driving down from Dallas, 80 miles an hour.
[02:12:38.188 --> 02:12:39.429]  And I watched him.
[02:12:39.429 --> 02:12:42.509]  You know, his eyes were alert and were like, you know, you got to fight, you got to fight.
[02:12:42.509 --> 02:12:45.430]  And he was sort of trying to get his leg out of the bed and you could see him fighting.
[02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:48.111]  And then he, his eyes rolled back in his head after about 20 minutes.
[02:12:48.111 --> 02:12:51.712]  And then they were pumping him full of all these drugs just to keep him alive.
[02:12:51.712 --> 02:12:53.312]  He was literally like a zombie then.
[02:12:54.642 --> 02:13:05.068]  All of his core functions were shutting down and then his dad got there and he died.
[02:13:05.068 --> 02:13:11.051]  They took him off the respirator, but he was conscious and alive on the respirator, sitting there while I was talking to him, but I'm flashing back to that.
[02:13:11.051 --> 02:13:11.851]  That's a side issue.
[02:13:13.348 --> 02:13:19.113]  It brought me back to that, to have the paramedics and the firemen going, come on, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[02:13:19.113 --> 02:13:22.495]  And the guy was, and you could see him on the gurney and you could see him just fighting, fighting.
[02:13:22.495 --> 02:13:24.777]  Can you imagine laboring not to die?
[02:13:24.777 --> 02:13:26.779]  I mean, it just, it's just so horrible.
[02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:36.343]  And so it's that humanity there, and then I saw people on my comment page on InfoWars going, eh, that guy shouldn't have been out late, you know, after New Year's to see the fireworks.
[02:13:36.343 --> 02:13:37.305]  He should have been with his daughter.
[02:13:37.305 --> 02:13:40.388]  They were dehumanizing him and saying, so the officer made a mistake, so what?
[02:13:40.388 --> 02:13:41.950]  Some eggs get broken.
[02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:47.277]  And just that attitude, and then seeing that guy fighting for his life, and then he died by the time he got to the hospital.
[02:13:48.342 --> 02:13:57.549]  But that, the issue is, is that these BART police with the subway system in San Francisco and surrounding areas have done this repeatedly.
[02:13:57.549 --> 02:14:01.612]  And I did a lot of research on this last night and printed off all these articles.
[02:14:01.612 --> 02:14:10.579]  This big stack, there's no way to go over all of them today, but there's so many facets to this.
[02:14:10.579 --> 02:14:16.884]  Number one, the police are saying that they believe that the officer
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:20.281]  Had taser confusion.
[02:14:20.281 --> 02:14:22.702]  That he thought he was pulling his taser.
[02:14:22.702 --> 02:14:24.502]  Well, that's what the studies show.
[02:14:24.502 --> 02:14:41.748]  That now that police are so acclimated to shooting someone with the firearm-like device that fires electric hooks, that it is habituating them to the idea of pulling a weapon and firing it.
[02:14:43.553 --> 02:14:49.134]  And so in the heat of the moment, which was all the police officers in a delusional mindset.
[02:14:49.134 --> 02:14:53.555]  I mean, they're freaking out, they're yelling, they're commanding the guys are okay, okay.
[02:14:53.555 --> 02:14:57.976]  They're abusing one guy, jumping on him and slamming his head in the ground and putting their knees on his head.
[02:14:57.976 --> 02:14:59.236]  He's submitting.
[02:14:59.236 --> 02:15:01.997]  He turns around and goes like this, and they just, bam!
[02:15:01.997 --> 02:15:03.777]  You know, bring his head down and jump on him.
[02:15:03.777 --> 02:15:07.198]  And the other guy's like, don't hurt me, don't hurt me!
[02:15:07.198 --> 02:15:11.119]  And they put him down and they pull the gun and they shoot him.
[02:15:11.119 --> 02:15:12.099]  And let's, while I'm talking,
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:21.446]  Without audio, fast forward it and let's show people the shooting video they're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:15:21.446 --> 02:15:31.673]  So, A, there's the issue of the overreactions, the police all amped up in this paramilitary idea that they're in Fallujah fighting a enemy instead of being peace officers.
[02:15:31.673 --> 02:15:36.096]  They don't have a true warrior's restraint.
[02:15:36.096 --> 02:15:36.336]  Okay?
[02:15:39.679 --> 02:15:42.840]  Then there is the issue of the police lied.
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:16:05.625]  For three days after this happened, through Monday, from last Friday, they were saying, well, there was an altercation, there was a tussle, there was a disturbance going on between the officers and these guys, and he was not restrained, they were not restrained, and that's lie number two, because he was restrained, they were on top of him when they shot him.
[02:16:08.613 --> 02:16:11.335]  And they went on to say there's not any video of it.
[02:16:11.335 --> 02:16:18.520]  The videos that were there at the DART station, those cameras weren't recording that day.
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:20.482]  Probably a lie.
[02:16:20.482 --> 02:16:21.723]  But then they didn't tell the public.
[02:16:21.723 --> 02:16:28.488]  They confiscated two videos shot by people on the platform there at the subway, there at the train station.
[02:16:28.488 --> 02:16:32.210]  So they're lying to the public saying we don't have any videos while they have videos.
[02:16:32.210 --> 02:16:33.812]  Well, thank God
[02:16:35.011 --> 02:16:40.477]  Folks pulling up in the next train saw the altercation start, that's the video on your screen, and caught it on tape.
[02:16:40.477 --> 02:16:45.684]  And now another video from on the platform, not in the train, also caught it from another angle.
[02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:59.173]  So the issue here is, the big overriding issue is, the lying and deception of the police in this case, which is par for the course.
[02:16:59.173 --> 02:17:06.135]  It has become acceptable for them to cover their own butts, even when they've committed murder or possibly manslaughter.
[02:17:06.135 --> 02:17:07.696]  It may be the lesser manslaughter.
[02:17:08.476 --> 02:17:12.881]  But they indict themselves by lying about it and trying to cover up.
[02:17:12.881 --> 02:17:14.202]  So cameras go two ways.
[02:17:14.202 --> 02:17:18.266]  You can surveil us, but we can surveil you, and we are.
[02:17:18.266 --> 02:17:22.210]  So you're playing an old game, decades old, and you can get away with lying.
[02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:22.951]  You can't do it now.
[02:17:26.326 --> 02:17:28.668]  Are you wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[02:17:28.668 --> 02:17:34.913]  Are you confident that the financial advisor is experienced enough to combat climbing interest rates, taxes, and inflation?

[02:18:02.910 --> 02:18:03.170]  I think so.
[02:18:24.662 --> 02:18:31.403]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:18:31.403 --> 02:18:34.064]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:18:34.064 --> 02:18:35.604]  But who is the enemy?
[02:18:35.604 --> 02:18:36.404]  Bin Laden.
[02:18:36.404 --> 02:18:37.345]  This is his ammo.
[02:18:37.345 --> 02:18:38.765]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:18:38.765 --> 02:18:40.765]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:18:40.765 --> 02:18:47.907]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:18:47.907 --> 02:18:48.387]  Some U.S.
[02:18:48.387 --> 02:18:54.028]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:18:54.748 --> 02:18:58.231]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:18:58.231 --> 02:19:01.053]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.742]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[02:19:27.742 --> 02:19:32.785]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with the reflective spray.
[02:19:32.785 --> 02:19:34.726]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[02:19:34.726 --> 02:19:36.067]  We are under the microscope.
[02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:40.070]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:43.712]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[02:20:24.614 --> 02:20:26.595]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:26.595 --> 02:20:33.558]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:20:33.558 --> 02:20:41.961]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:41.961 --> 02:20:47.684]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:47.864 --> 02:20:49.705]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:20:49.705 --> 02:20:52.006]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:52.006 --> 02:20:56.428]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:56.428 --> 02:20:58.649]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:20:58.649 --> 02:21:06.413]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:21:07.153 --> 02:21:10.094]  Okay, let's just get right back into the transmission here.
[02:21:38.186 --> 02:21:42.209]  The videos, again, are all up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:21:42.209 --> 02:21:46.032]  There's two separate videos of the shooting.
[02:21:46.032 --> 02:21:58.041]  So they're not resisting, they slam him down on the ground, two of them, and the police officer just pulls his handgun out, shoots the man in the back, and gives him a lethal blow.
[02:21:58.041 --> 02:22:00.043]  He later died at the hospital.
[02:22:00.043 --> 02:22:05.627]  Then the police say there's no videotapes of this, the video cameras were not recording at the DART station.
[02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:11.747]  Then we learn they confiscate videos from people that were shooting them on cell phones, but not all of them.
[02:22:11.747 --> 02:22:18.996]  Then they lie and say there are no other videos, and then Monday it breaks on the news that people did get the videos to the news.
[02:22:20.299 --> 02:22:23.421]  And so then the videos are released and it shows they're lying there.
[02:22:23.421 --> 02:22:26.802]  But now the media isn't finishing their job.
[02:22:26.802 --> 02:22:35.887]  They're not pointing out that there was a lie about the fact that there were no videotapes of this or the police had confiscated them and were lying about that.
[02:22:35.887 --> 02:22:41.550]  Or the police lied and claimed there was some type of altercation going on between the officers and these young men.
[02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:43.709]  Then the story changed.
[02:22:43.709 --> 02:22:54.073]  They were there because of a previous altercation, but the police had lied and made it semantically sound like the altercation was with police and the young men, when the video shows they're doing nothing.
[02:22:54.073 --> 02:23:02.357]  So, there are just so many examples of this over and over again, and we have the different press conferences that the DART officials and police
[02:23:03.430 --> 02:23:32.156]  have put on this is not the san francisco or oakland police uh... this is uh... the dart uh... transit police are all over that area and again they don't have really any oversight and a lot of uh... police agencies are pointing that out in california has a bad history of this and so is the attorney general of california and i want to investigation on monday when these videos came out so the issue here is deception and lying about this in the public needs to realize that
[02:23:32.936 --> 02:23:40.261]  Lying by police agencies is the rule, not the exception.
[02:23:40.261 --> 02:23:45.344]  And then we have to discuss the fact of this guy is on paid administrative leave.
[02:23:45.344 --> 02:23:47.465]  We don't even know the name of this officer.
[02:23:47.465 --> 02:23:50.207]  He bare minimum needs to get manslaughter.
[02:23:50.207 --> 02:23:52.748]  Even if it wasn't intentional and he really thought it was his taser.
[02:23:52.748 --> 02:23:54.369]  And he hasn't said that yet.
[02:23:54.369 --> 02:23:57.371]  Police groups are saying it looks like he thought it was his taser.
[02:23:57.371 --> 02:24:00.213]  And I tend to agree that it could be that because
[02:24:01.331 --> 02:24:13.982]  He pulls it out, aims, fires right into the man's back, and then goes like that, and according to witnesses, we don't have the audio, starts cussing going, and the police are like, what in the world just happened?
[02:24:13.982 --> 02:24:24.331]  So you have this trigger-happy, unstable person, you've got them militarized like they're fighting some enemy force, they're no longer peace officers, you've got this guy begging.
[02:24:26.602 --> 02:24:29.645]  A lot of verbal jockeying, a lot of arguing between the two groups of men.
[02:24:47.893 --> 02:24:53.115]  At some point, an officer's firearm discharged, striking Mr. Grant.
[02:24:53.115 --> 02:24:59.757]  Witnesses claim that BART police confronted 22-year-old Oscar Grant on the Fruitvale platform.
[02:24:59.757 --> 02:25:05.959]  Okay, so notice how he semantically said there was verbal jockeying going on between the men.
[02:25:05.959 --> 02:25:13.282]  At some time, and he's leaving it open, the officer discharged his firearm.
[02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:24.767]  And then they go on in other clips from that press conference, you can watch the whole lengthy thing on YouTube and Google, to go on and say that he was not restrained.
[02:25:24.767 --> 02:25:26.790]  Well, the police were on top of him.
[02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:29.134]  They slammed him down, holding him down when they shot him.
[02:25:30.711 --> 02:25:35.896]  And you can watch all that on the video, but the bigger issue is they lied about not having videos.
[02:25:35.896 --> 02:25:37.638]  They said there are no videos.
[02:25:37.638 --> 02:25:40.641]  And we have all these clips, but if you want to go watch them on the web, you can.
[02:25:40.641 --> 02:25:46.307]  In the interest of time, we're not going to be able to play all of those because this is quite a bloody soap opera.
[02:25:46.307 --> 02:25:48.890]  Go ahead and play a little bit more of this clip.
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:03.625]  Our preliminary investigation indicates that Mr. Grant was not restrained when the officers firearm discharged.
[02:26:04.096 --> 02:26:08.638]  Bart says several other men were cuffed and the officer's gun was out of the holster.
[02:26:08.638 --> 02:26:11.018]  They don't know yet if the shooting was an accident.
[02:26:11.018 --> 02:26:13.399]  Police found no weapons among the men.
[02:26:13.399 --> 02:26:16.120]  Oscar Grant was rushed to Oakland's Highland Hospital.
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:20.701]  Our trauma team immediately took over and began working on him.
[02:26:20.701 --> 02:26:26.383]  Now again, basically everything this Bart spokesman says turns out to not be true.
[02:26:26.383 --> 02:26:28.704]  But notice he says, well it was out of the holster.
[02:26:28.704 --> 02:26:29.524]  They knew the whole time.
[02:26:29.524 --> 02:26:30.785]  They confiscated the videos.
[02:26:31.650 --> 02:26:37.152]  They were telling the public that they didn't have the BART videos, which I don't believe for a minute.
[02:26:37.152 --> 02:26:38.853]  So you can just go right down the line.
[02:26:38.853 --> 02:26:41.514]  There's more and more of these clips.
[02:26:41.514 --> 02:26:46.675]  So he's out saying there was an altercation, officers were there, the guy was not restrained.
[02:26:46.675 --> 02:26:47.916]  All that sells the image.
[02:26:47.916 --> 02:26:52.177]  This guy was up and about in an altercation and somehow somebody gets shot.
[02:26:52.177 --> 02:26:58.940]  Then the videos come out and it's exactly what the witnesses said, which was 180 degrees from what the police were saying.
[02:26:59.864 --> 02:27:01.385]  And this guy's dead.
[02:27:01.385 --> 02:27:07.391]  So thank God that more and more citizens know to keep their cameras trained on the police.
[02:27:07.391 --> 02:27:11.935]  And we have cell phone cameras and iPhone cameras and others proliferating everywhere.
[02:27:11.935 --> 02:27:15.338]  Stay with us.
[02:27:15.338 --> 02:27:16.739]  We're on the march.
[02:27:16.739 --> 02:27:19.261]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:19.261 --> 02:27:21.964]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:25.071 --> 02:27:33.776]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:27:33.776 --> 02:27:38.918]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S.
[02:27:38.918 --> 02:27:39.779]  and Canada.
[02:27:39.779 --> 02:27:46.302]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[02:27:46.863 --> 02:27:50.264]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:27:50.264 --> 02:27:52.705]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:28:24.568 --> 02:28:26.589]  Can I have everybody's attention please?
[02:28:26.589 --> 02:28:29.010]  I've come with a message of information.
[02:28:29.010 --> 02:28:31.692]  9-11 was an inside job.
[02:28:31.692 --> 02:28:32.852]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:28:32.852 --> 02:28:34.553]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:28:34.553 --> 02:28:37.434]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[02:28:37.434 --> 02:28:41.076]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:28:50.733 --> 02:28:55.603]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:28:55.603 --> 02:28:56.705]  An inside job.
[02:28:59.384 --> 02:29:01.825]  How dare you?
[02:29:01.825 --> 02:29:06.906]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:29:06.906 --> 02:29:09.027]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:29:09.027 --> 02:29:09.487]  Truth Rising.

[02:30:25.595 --> 02:30:26.137]  Uh oh.
[02:30:29.704 --> 02:30:36.585]  We've only got Ray McGovern for 10 minutes with us, but he's agreed to come back for 30 minutes or longer next week.
[02:30:36.585 --> 02:30:44.207]  He was on Laird NewsHour last night giving his take on Barack Obama's intelligence agency appointments, or near appointments.
[02:30:44.207 --> 02:30:49.087]  Then I want to spend a few minutes with him on the Gaza situation.
[02:30:49.087 --> 02:30:56.749]  Of course, Ray McGovern, CIA analyst, morning briefer for Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr., and others, and he's the guy who exposed the fact in his face
[02:30:57.549 --> 02:30:59.270]  Well, I'm not a big favorite of Gates.
[02:30:59.270 --> 02:31:03.051]  He worked for me at one point back in the 60s, early 70s.
[02:31:22.623 --> 02:31:24.444]  I don't have a good opinion of him.
[02:31:24.444 --> 02:31:30.468]  Besides that, he espouses policies that Obama is, at least theoretically, against.
[02:31:30.468 --> 02:31:43.497]  National missile defense, putting missiles in the Czech Republic and Poland, doing other things that appeal to the military-industrial complex.
[02:31:43.497 --> 02:31:50.181]  Gates is a threat, and I'm afraid that Obama's made things more difficult for him by keeping Gates on.
[02:31:51.001 --> 02:31:55.422]  What about the new folks that he's moving into the appointments?
[02:31:55.422 --> 02:32:02.903]  Well, Leon Panetta is an old Washington hand who knows the ropes.
[02:32:02.903 --> 02:32:06.624]  He was chief of staff for Clinton for a while.
[02:32:06.624 --> 02:32:10.304]  He was head of the Bureau of Management and Budget.
[02:32:10.304 --> 02:32:12.485]  He was a big budget guy in the Congress.
[02:32:12.485 --> 02:32:18.006]  As a matter of fact, people don't realize this, but Panetta was one of those responsible for budget surplus.
[02:32:18.006 --> 02:32:18.626]  Can you imagine that?
[02:32:19.056 --> 02:32:21.256]  You know what surplus means?
[02:32:21.256 --> 02:32:22.037]  You know?
[02:32:22.037 --> 02:32:23.457]  In the 90s under Clinton.
[02:32:23.457 --> 02:32:24.597]  So he's a bright guy.
[02:32:24.597 --> 02:32:25.737]  He's as bright as they come.
[02:32:25.737 --> 02:32:30.038]  More important, he's got unimpeachable integrity.
[02:32:30.038 --> 02:32:34.039]  And he's made a name for himself outside intelligence work.
[02:32:34.039 --> 02:32:35.739]  And he's a good manager.
[02:32:35.739 --> 02:32:39.380]  And those are the prerequisites for a good Director of Intelligence.
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:44.001]  And I speak from some experience on this, Alex, since I served under nine of them.
[02:32:44.001 --> 02:32:45.201]  Nine.
[02:32:45.201 --> 02:32:45.901]  What about Blair?
[02:32:47.148 --> 02:32:51.049]  Blair is a... the returns are not all in on Blair.
[02:32:51.049 --> 02:32:53.770]  My colleagues, some of them, worked with him.
[02:32:53.770 --> 02:33:12.636]  He is said to be a pretty good strategic thinker, but when you look at how he acted, for example, when he was chief of forces in the Pacific, and the Indonesian generals decided to give a real bloody nose to the indigenous people in East Timor, before Timor got its independence,
[02:33:13.359 --> 02:33:15.660]  Well, Blair was supposed to restrain them.
[02:33:15.660 --> 02:33:22.665]  He was supposed to go to the generals and say, look, stop massacring people in churches and doing all manner of other things like that.
[02:33:22.665 --> 02:33:39.135]  And instead, despite the instructions from the State Department and from the National Security Council, Blair coddled these generals because he saw as his mission the coddling of military opposite numbers in Indonesia, a very important country.
[02:33:39.781 --> 02:33:57.764]  And so that gives me pause, you know, that really gives me great pause because this story is corroborated by cables that were leaked to certain reporters, cables from the State Department and from the NSC saying, look, get them to stop the atrocities.
[02:33:57.764 --> 02:34:03.965]  And instead of that, by all accounts, Blair went ahead and told them, well, you know, it's going to be all right.
[02:34:03.965 --> 02:34:05.585]  We'll support you no matter what.
[02:34:05.585 --> 02:34:07.906]  That's an old syndrome in the military.
[02:34:07.906 --> 02:34:09.086]  I hope he's outgrown that.
[02:34:11.451 --> 02:34:35.892]  Mr. McGovern, in the time that we have left with you, bottom line, what is your analysis of what happened in Mumbai, formerly Bombay, three weeks ago, four weeks ago, just briefly, and then currently what's happening in Gaza with the Israeli siege and encirclement of the three major cities there?
[02:34:37.304 --> 02:34:44.886]  Well, I don't know much about Mumbai that hasn't been in the newspapers, but I do know something about the problem in Gaza.
[02:34:44.886 --> 02:34:48.267]  It is unconscionable what the Israeli forces are doing there.
[02:34:48.267 --> 02:34:52.208]  They couldn't do it without the blessing of our government.
[02:34:52.208 --> 02:34:54.008]  So we're all to blame.
[02:34:54.008 --> 02:34:56.929]  We're all responsible for these atrocities.
[02:34:56.929 --> 02:34:59.189]  It is ethnic cleansing.
[02:34:59.189 --> 02:35:05.571]  It is the removal, to the degree they can, of all the Palestinians that inhabit that part of the world.
[02:35:06.221 --> 02:35:22.309]  It is just beyond belief that we as a nation would sit still for the bombing of civilians, the killing of some 550 people now, 550 Palestinians as opposed to, I think the last number I saw, 7 Israelis.
[02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:23.889]  Now does that sound disproportionate to you?
[02:35:23.889 --> 02:35:25.570]  It certainly sounds disproportionate.
[02:35:28.631 --> 02:35:38.200]  We have a high-tech military that broke the ceasefire in multiple ways, in bombings and shutting down the entrance points to the Gaza Strip.
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:47.189]  And then we have this hoax in our media that Hamas singularly is to blame for breaking the truce.
[02:35:47.189 --> 02:35:52.054]  Yeah, you know what I call the fawning corporate media, the FCM.
[02:35:54.005 --> 02:35:58.646]  I cannot be depended on to give anything near an objective view on these things.
[02:35:58.646 --> 02:36:07.869]  And that's really mischievous because most of the American people don't have any way, except for programs like yours, of knowing what really is going on there.
[02:36:07.869 --> 02:36:16.791]  And what really is going on there is very much akin to what went on in Nazi Germany when the Jews were on the receiving end of this kind of atrocity.
[02:36:19.005 --> 02:36:20.286]  Or the Native Americans.
[02:36:20.286 --> 02:36:38.240]  You know, Hitler wrote, as you know, sir, that he took his concentration camp strategy from what happened in the West, in the United States, in the 1860s and 70s and 80s and 90s, and then the Israelis, it's come out, have actually adopted some of those same systems.
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:43.204]  Yeah, and I've heard, well, I was in Israel summer before last,
[02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:51.595]  A very prominent settler on the top of one of these gleaming hills told me, look, don't criticize us for what we're doing.
[02:36:51.595 --> 02:36:53.816]  Look what you did to the Indians.
[02:36:53.816 --> 02:36:56.117]  And I said to him, look, that was then.
[02:36:56.117 --> 02:36:57.178]  We're sorry for that.
[02:36:57.178 --> 02:36:58.719]  We still have to atone for that.
[02:36:58.719 --> 02:37:00.660]  But now is now.
[02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:08.685]  And when I watch, when I look at these, every hillside topped by gleaming alabaster settlements,
[02:37:09.375 --> 02:37:17.236]  Where down in the villages below, people are deprived of wells, of running water, of access to their fields.
[02:37:17.236 --> 02:37:30.359]  You know, this is really, really bad, Alex, and we have to wake up the American people, because if they knew, I still have enough faith in the American people, if they knew what was really going on there, we would do something about it.
[02:37:30.359 --> 02:37:36.460]  We would pursue our Congress people, our Senators, and make sure that they did not give $3 billion
[02:37:37.825 --> 02:37:42.468]  Every year to Israel to perpetrate these atrocities.
[02:37:42.468 --> 02:37:49.692]  In closing, I want to talk about how you, from past operations that we've seen with the Israelis, how this will play out.
[02:37:49.692 --> 02:37:55.635]  And will they turn north into Lebanon, as they're saying they may do now, and try to widen this, trying to blame it on Iran.
[02:37:55.635 --> 02:37:58.277]  Right now claiming they're behind Hamas.
[02:37:58.277 --> 02:38:01.118]  We know they're behind Hezbollah, but not Hamas.
[02:38:01.118 --> 02:38:01.639]  That point,
[02:38:02.792 --> 02:38:13.781]  But first, did the Israelis not launch this during the interim, when Bush is a lame duck with the three weeks left at that time when they launched it, and when Obama isn't in yet, so that there's that smoke screen?
[02:38:13.781 --> 02:38:17.424]  I mean, they did launch the attacks on Christmas Eve.
[02:38:17.424 --> 02:38:19.346]  Yeah, that was part of the plan, of course.
[02:38:19.346 --> 02:38:23.629]  There's no better friend, so to speak, of Israel than George Bush.
[02:38:23.629 --> 02:38:25.651]  He's not going to do anything about it, of course.
[02:38:25.651 --> 02:38:29.254]  He's not even permitted his folks to call for a ceasefire.
[02:38:29.878 --> 02:38:30.599]  So that was part of it.
[02:38:30.599 --> 02:38:34.122]  The other part has to do with who's the most belligerent in Israel.
[02:38:34.122 --> 02:38:38.485]  There's an election coming up in about six weeks.
[02:38:38.485 --> 02:38:43.950]  It looks like Netanyahu, who's Mr. Belligerent, has the edge.
[02:38:43.950 --> 02:38:54.339]  So Tippi Livni and Barack, the defense minister, are trying to appear just as aggressive.
[02:38:54.339 --> 02:38:58.162]  So you have the political dynamic in both countries at work here.
[02:38:58.607 --> 02:39:08.810]  And of course, on the receiving end of all this stuff are the people in Gaza, crammed into a very short area, 1.5 million of them.
[02:39:08.810 --> 02:39:17.972]  So, this has got to stop, and if we do an act as a restraining force, then the Israelis just might.
[02:39:17.972 --> 02:39:24.134]  There's an outside chance that the Israelis might feel so hubris-ful
[02:39:24.795 --> 02:39:34.538]  That they would say, hmm, you know, Bush has almost two weeks left, you know, why don't we blame the Iranians for something really big that happens to our forces?
[02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:37.641]  And go take out some of those sites in Iran.
[02:39:37.641 --> 02:39:43.205]  Then the Americans would have to be full square behind us because Bush has promised to do that.
[02:39:43.205 --> 02:39:44.886]  That's still a concern of mine.
[02:39:44.886 --> 02:39:57.373]  Well, sir, that's what you said here six months ago was, I remember seeing this even in the press, that some of the neocons in Israel were saying the time to attack would be after Obama was elected, in between that interim time.
[02:39:57.373 --> 02:40:01.495]  Yeah, I think the real sticking point here is two things.
[02:40:01.495 --> 02:40:02.196]  One is that
[02:40:03.118 --> 02:40:09.963]  Admiral Mullen, the head of the Joint Chiefs, probably would delay for two weeks before he carried out orders like that.
[02:40:09.963 --> 02:40:23.434]  It just would be seen so crassly as Jeanne Bush's last gasp that I doubt whether Mullen, if ordered to do that, would set his forces on Iran.
[02:40:23.434 --> 02:40:32.160]  The other thing is that the Russians, after that fracas in Georgia, the Russians came to the Israelis and to us and said,
[02:40:33.171 --> 02:40:33.811]  We've had it.
[02:40:33.811 --> 02:40:34.692]  That's enough.
[02:40:34.692 --> 02:40:35.573]  That's enough.
[02:40:35.573 --> 02:40:37.994]  We don't want any more of this stuff in our backyard.
[02:40:37.994 --> 02:40:39.135]  Don't even think.
[02:40:39.135 --> 02:40:40.877]  Don't even think of attacking Iran.
[02:40:40.877 --> 02:40:48.022]  And I think, if you look at the timing, early August, that's when all the propaganda fell off, and that's when the Israelis and the U.S.
[02:40:48.022 --> 02:40:51.724]  started getting more sensible in their approach to Iran.
[02:40:51.724 --> 02:40:57.549]  Do you think, in closing, that Obama will put the missiles in Poland and Ukraine?
[02:40:57.549 --> 02:40:59.090]  I hope not.
[02:40:59.090 --> 02:41:02.352]  He's got Gates there, and Gates is strongly for it.
[02:41:03.246 --> 02:41:13.253]  You know, it all depends, really, on how much beholden Barack Obama is to the military-industrial complex, because that's what this is all about.
[02:41:13.253 --> 02:41:15.055]  Missile systems that won't work.
[02:41:15.055 --> 02:41:17.236]  Missile systems that can always be overcome.
[02:41:17.236 --> 02:41:18.337]  Well, look at Rahm Emanuel!
[02:41:18.337 --> 02:41:19.318]  Look at Rahm Emanuel!
[02:41:19.318 --> 02:41:21.820]  I mean, is that not a sign of where Obama's going?
[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:23.781]  Well, we'll see.
[02:41:23.781 --> 02:41:30.386]  I like to think that with these last appointments in the Justice Department and at the CIA, that he's getting back in balance.
[02:41:30.774 --> 02:41:44.958]  Maybe when you're on next week, we can talk about the possibility, now that you're in remission from lymphoma cancer, we all prayed for you, that we can talk about you writing a book or something, because you're so respected and have called so many things accurately.
[02:41:44.958 --> 02:41:47.379]  Are you looking at writing a book?
[02:41:47.379 --> 02:41:56.842]  Because every time I have you on, I wish there was something I could plug so people could... I mean, you're in my film, Terror Storm, but other than that, so folks can really get an idea about your perspective.
[02:41:56.842 --> 02:41:58.623]  Well, they can look on ConsortiumNews.com.
[02:42:00.086 --> 02:42:04.989]  That's c-o-n-s-o-r-t-i-u-m-news-dot-com.
[02:42:04.989 --> 02:42:09.052]  That's my blog of choice, where I publish first.
[02:42:09.052 --> 02:42:10.673]  I will write to write a book, Alex.
[02:42:10.673 --> 02:42:14.296]  I'm afraid I'd lose my wife.
[02:42:14.296 --> 02:42:17.458]  I've got to run off now, but it's been fun being with you.
[02:42:17.458 --> 02:42:18.298]  Thank you, Ray McGovern.
[02:42:18.298 --> 02:42:19.319]  We'll talk to you next week.
[02:42:19.319 --> 02:42:20.360]  Okay, bye.
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:21.861]  There he goes.
[02:42:21.861 --> 02:42:23.482]  You'd think I'd learn how to read.
[02:42:23.482 --> 02:42:27.064]  Here's my producer folder.
[02:42:27.064 --> 02:42:27.785]  Ray McGovern, 1 to 130.
[02:42:30.049 --> 02:42:34.332]  And I somehow looked at that and had it from 1.30 to 2.
[02:42:34.332 --> 02:42:36.273]  That's how my brain works.
[02:42:36.273 --> 02:42:38.354]  And he wasn't going to be with us longer.
[02:42:38.354 --> 02:42:38.814]  You know what?
[02:42:38.814 --> 02:42:44.898]  Aaron, set him up for a full hour next week because I know he'll agree to do it.
[02:42:44.898 --> 02:42:46.139]  I've never talked about that.
[02:42:46.139 --> 02:42:50.722]  He was the boss of Gates for years.
[02:42:50.722 --> 02:42:54.404]  And we could really get a perspective into the Defense Secretary from Ray McGovern.
[02:42:54.404 --> 02:42:55.845]  I mean, that guy has been everywhere.
[02:42:55.845 --> 02:42:58.866]  He was also an Army captain, of course, in Vietnam.
[02:42:58.866 --> 02:42:59.307]  What's going on?
[02:43:00.256 --> 02:43:08.879]  Now, yes, yes, I'm saying set Raymond Governor up for an hour next week.
[02:43:08.879 --> 02:43:18.101]  Oh, before I forget, while my producer's in there, let's get this former chief strategist policymaker from the Bank of England.
[02:43:18.101 --> 02:43:24.023]  He's saying we're going to have a depression and a devaluation of the dollar in two to five years.
[02:43:24.023 --> 02:43:26.164]  Steve Watson did an article on that today at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:26.164 --> 02:43:26.704]  Before I forget,
[02:43:27.711 --> 02:43:28.672]  I've got to multitask, folks.
[02:43:28.672 --> 02:43:29.753]  I've got to do all this on air.
[02:43:29.753 --> 02:43:34.257]  I'm like, during the breaks, I'm directing the TV show and trying to figure out what clips to get ready.
[02:43:34.257 --> 02:43:38.100]  I want to just say, we've been doing these TV shows in here now for, what, about two weeks?
[02:43:38.100 --> 02:43:40.502]  You guys are just getting better and better and better.
[02:43:40.502 --> 02:43:42.584]  We're having to expand the control room, though.
[02:43:42.584 --> 02:43:45.626]  Having three guys crammed in there, that's a bit of a problem.
[02:43:46.847 --> 02:43:48.667]  I need to do what I said I'd do two weeks ago.
[02:43:48.667 --> 02:43:57.289]  I need to get a camera out and kind of give folks a tour of this studio, of the control room out there, maybe interview you guys so people know who's behind the scenes.
[02:43:57.289 --> 02:43:58.569]  Well, wait, I could do that right now.
[02:43:58.569 --> 02:44:07.051]  We could rig one of these cameras up with a wireless unit into the feed and I could just walk around the office that way instead of videotaping it and editing it.
[02:44:07.051 --> 02:44:08.751]  It's a lot easier to do everything on the fly.
[02:44:08.751 --> 02:44:09.552]  No, no.
[02:44:09.552 --> 02:44:14.113]  Perhaps Friday, we should gear up Friday for a segment during PrisonPlanet.tv to
[02:44:17.335 --> 02:44:17.996]  Oh, there we go.
[02:44:17.996 --> 02:44:20.257]  He just rotated one of the robot cameras around.
[02:44:20.257 --> 02:44:24.080]  Yeah, go ahead and punch it up with you guys in there.
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:27.242]  Unfortunately, that camera is right up against the glass.
[02:44:27.242 --> 02:44:29.284]  There's Jaron right there.
[02:44:29.284 --> 02:44:34.127]  He's pointing his thumb over there at Paul Hartman, aka Hoosh.
[02:44:34.127 --> 02:44:37.389]  Fan of the Hoosiers over there.
[02:44:37.389 --> 02:44:39.231]  And there he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:41.032 --> 02:44:52.581]  You know, soon we're going to have a document cam mounted in the ceiling, up behind me, and so it'll be able to shoot down through the glass into those guys that are in there running the show.
[02:44:52.581 --> 02:45:00.507]  Okay, I am really babbling here, ladies and gentlemen, but that's what I do best.
[02:45:00.507 --> 02:45:00.787]  You know what?
[02:45:00.787 --> 02:45:02.208]  I want to go back to the BART video.
[02:45:02.208 --> 02:45:05.971]  Go back to the shooting video, because I ran out of time before McGovern was on with us.
[02:45:07.093 --> 02:45:08.634]  to cover that.
[02:45:08.634 --> 02:45:30.721]  Now remember, the police are saying here that they didn't have any videos and that the surveillance cameras in the BART facility there at the train station, there at the train stop, first weren't hooked into the recorders and then, oh, they didn't get a recording.
[02:45:30.721 --> 02:45:36.683]  Meanwhile, we find out within minutes they'd confiscated, this is days later they're saying this, knowing they confiscated cell phones that video on them.
[02:45:38.732 --> 02:45:48.777]  But again, thank God, a train pulled in, a subway car pulled in, and people were videotaping out of that, and people down the platform got video of the shooting.
[02:45:48.777 --> 02:45:54.639]  And, you know, I said it earlier, the system is playing a game from 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.
[02:45:56.428 --> 02:45:58.469]  Depending on which system they're involved in.
[02:45:58.469 --> 02:46:06.235]  And so they're used to lying, killing, covering up, engaging in corruption, without our cameras pointed back at them.
[02:46:06.235 --> 02:46:17.403]  You know, so nine times out of ten, it's their own cameras that they have to lie and claim malfunctioned or they don't have the footage, in every case, that's actually acting against them.
[02:46:17.403 --> 02:46:20.905]  And then it's our cameras that are built into the cell phones and everything that are having a problem.
[02:46:21.926 --> 02:46:23.868]  That's why they want to shut down the Internet.
[02:46:23.868 --> 02:46:26.110]  And the inventor of the Internet came out this week.
[02:46:26.110 --> 02:46:28.011]  Paul Watson did an article on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:46:28.011 --> 02:46:29.993]  It's there in the News in Focus section.
[02:46:29.993 --> 02:46:31.014]  I didn't cover it and should have.
[02:46:32.395 --> 02:46:38.377]  about the fact saying that the internet is dying and that's what Internet2 said they would do five years ago.
[02:46:38.377 --> 02:46:48.880]  They said we're gonna not upgrade the old web, we're not going to build new hubs, we're going to let it fail and shut it down through getting rid of net neutrality and taxes and regulations and filters and controls.
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:47:00.544]  And we're going to force you over an Internet2 where no one has an individual website but select corporations, they say 50 universities, 50 select corporations and government agencies.
[02:47:01.224 --> 02:47:05.347]  And so, they'll say, sorry, you don't get a subpage on the new MySpace Internet 2.
[02:47:05.347 --> 02:47:08.688]  You don't get a subpage on the new YouTube Internet 2.
[02:47:08.688 --> 02:47:16.833]  Or, you sign an agreement, you know, in terms of service, when you click and you register, saying they can erase you, they can delete you, they can restrict you.
[02:47:16.833 --> 02:47:19.735]  So, this is the larger program.
[02:47:19.735 --> 02:47:25.398]  But go ahead and punch that video back up and just go ahead and roll out to break the audio of the shooting.
[02:47:25.398 --> 02:47:26.019]  Go ahead, here it is.
[02:47:27.097 --> 02:47:33.040]  Taken from the BART train, recorded on a cell phone by a passenger who doesn't want to be identified.
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:37.362]  You can see 22-year-old Oscar Grant on his knees talking to police.
[02:47:37.362 --> 02:47:40.044]  He is pulled onto the ground, face down.
[02:47:40.044 --> 02:47:46.347]  Then, after what appears to be a struggle, a BART officer puts his knee to Grant's neck and head, and another officer steps back.
[02:47:46.867 --> 02:47:47.487]  Stop right there.
[02:47:47.487 --> 02:47:48.268]  Stop right there.
[02:47:48.268 --> 02:47:54.630]  Every time I see police jump on somebody and beat them up for no reason, they call it a tussle or a struggle.
[02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:56.530]  The guy has his hands like this.
[02:47:56.530 --> 02:47:57.150]  They grab him.
[02:47:57.150 --> 02:47:57.851]  They put him down.
[02:47:57.851 --> 02:47:58.691]  He's doing nothing.
[02:47:58.691 --> 02:47:59.791]  They jump on him.
[02:47:59.791 --> 02:48:01.812]  You see his body flinch.
[02:48:01.812 --> 02:48:02.252]  And they do that.
[02:48:02.252 --> 02:48:06.213]  They go, oh, I just jumped on your neck with my 250-pound body.
[02:48:06.213 --> 02:48:07.754]  How dare you flinch in pain?
[02:48:07.754 --> 02:48:08.294]  That's it.
[02:48:08.294 --> 02:48:09.634]  I'm going to taser you.
[02:48:09.634 --> 02:48:14.916]  But he pulls a gun and shoots him in the back.
[02:48:16.109 --> 02:48:18.950]  So notice the media even, what appears to be a tussle.
[02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:21.051]  They'll probably say he deserved to die next.
[02:48:21.051 --> 02:48:22.852]  Ah well, he attacked the officers, he's dead.
[02:48:22.852 --> 02:48:25.754]  Heil Hitler!
[02:48:25.754 --> 02:48:30.116]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[02:48:30.116 --> 02:48:32.657]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[02:48:32.657 --> 02:48:37.960]  Gasfreedom.info has the information you need to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:40.340]  We're good to go!
[02:49:03.848 --> 02:49:04.108]  I think so.
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:31.904]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:49:31.904 --> 02:49:34.545]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:49:34.545 --> 02:49:36.106]  But who is the enemy?
[02:49:36.106 --> 02:49:36.907]  Bin Laden.
[02:49:36.907 --> 02:49:37.847]  This is his ammo.
[02:49:37.847 --> 02:49:39.268]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:49:39.268 --> 02:49:41.249]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:49:41.249 --> 02:49:48.413]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:49:48.413 --> 02:49:48.894]  Some U.S.
[02:49:48.894 --> 02:49:54.537]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:49:55.217 --> 02:49:58.720]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:01.542]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[02:50:25.288 --> 02:50:28.731]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:50:28.731 --> 02:50:32.974]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:50:32.974 --> 02:50:40.941]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water,
[02:50:41.221 --> 02:50:41.661]  We're good to go!
[02:51:11.049 --> 02:51:11.810]  I think so.
[02:51:37.182 --> 02:51:44.914]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[02:51:49.385 --> 02:52:05.296]  We're going to do something new around here to raise funds for the new TV studio we're building out here.
[02:52:05.296 --> 02:52:08.959]  I'm going to sell off something I've never done.
[02:52:08.959 --> 02:52:12.581]  Infowars memorabilia.
[02:52:12.581 --> 02:52:14.343]  This is a first of a kind.
[02:52:14.343 --> 02:52:16.004]  Buy this evening for $1,500, opening auction.
[02:52:19.580 --> 02:52:22.821]  On eBay, we'll have an InfoWars account.
[02:52:22.821 --> 02:52:28.263]  It'll be linked up on InfoWars.com by 6 o'clock Central.
[02:52:28.263 --> 02:52:32.464]  This is the bullhorn that I've had for about six years.
[02:52:32.464 --> 02:52:35.685]  This is in the film, A Scanner Darkly.
[02:52:35.685 --> 02:52:37.486]  I use my own bullhorn in the film.
[02:52:38.832 --> 02:52:50.754]  It was broken in Scanner Darkly when I was doing stunts with the SWAT team cops tackling me in scene after scene with Keanu Reeves and we had it fixed.
[02:52:52.304 --> 02:52:59.552]  And then in Denver this year, you see the MSNBC staff assault it with a knife.
[02:52:59.552 --> 02:53:02.215]  They grab it out of my hands and cut it.
[02:53:02.215 --> 02:53:04.938]  We're going to link that video up on YouTube.
[02:53:04.938 --> 02:53:06.900]  And you can even see the cut where they sliced it.
[02:53:06.900 --> 02:53:09.503]  90% through right there.
[02:53:09.503 --> 02:53:10.605]  You're welcome to buy it.
[02:53:10.605 --> 02:53:11.446]  I'm going to sign it.
[02:53:12.455 --> 02:53:16.777]  You're welcome to fix it if you want or leave it broken, but this has been through the wars.
[02:53:16.777 --> 02:53:19.038]  I had one other megaphone before this over the years.
[02:53:19.038 --> 02:53:21.339]  I found this to be the best model from Radio Shack.
[02:53:21.339 --> 02:53:27.682]  We now have two replacements, but this is the most heavily action megaphone I've had.
[02:53:27.682 --> 02:53:32.504]  This sucker has been through the wars and is in the film A Scanner Darkly.
[02:53:32.504 --> 02:53:35.105]  Fifteen hundred dollars and it will be used.
[02:53:35.105 --> 02:53:35.665]  That's nothing.
[02:53:35.665 --> 02:53:37.146]  I mean, that's nothing.
[02:53:37.146 --> 02:53:41.588]  It's going to cost another hundred grand to finish the other studio we're going to have out there, and that's doing it on the cheaps.
[02:53:42.639 --> 02:53:50.986]  So instead of just getting up here and saying, send me donations or buy my books and videos to fund it, which is also another way to do it, here it is ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:50.986 --> 02:54:01.636]  And so we'll also get this video up on YouTube so we can link to that so that everybody can see what they're bidding on.
[02:54:01.636 --> 02:54:03.278]  And let's have, I don't really know much about eBay.
[02:54:03.278 --> 02:54:07.481]  We can do a couple days right on the bidding.
[02:54:07.481 --> 02:54:08.042]  It's one week?
[02:54:09.252 --> 02:54:09.612]  Standard.
[02:54:09.612 --> 02:54:13.253]  So we'll do a week-long bidding process on this.
[02:54:13.253 --> 02:54:23.436]  It'll be up by tonight and then soon after we'll add to the page some YouTube videos of this and maybe even a link to Scanner Darkly where you can see this bad boy in action.
[02:54:23.436 --> 02:54:25.016]  So, I never gave it a name.
[02:54:25.016 --> 02:54:27.837]  I called it Taranty Crusher 1.
[02:54:27.837 --> 02:54:31.038]  Here we go.
[02:54:31.038 --> 02:54:35.039]  And again, it doesn't work because it was sliced by MSNBC.
[02:54:35.039 --> 02:54:35.579]  All on video.
[02:54:37.912 --> 02:54:42.914]  And we'll also link to that video that Rob edited together of the footage of them assaulting us.
[02:54:42.914 --> 02:54:47.236]  And then of course, we got, we are changed there within 20 minutes with two bullhorns.
[02:54:47.236 --> 02:54:56.020]  We put Luke Rudowski up on this huge guy's shoulders, like 6'7", big NFL, you know, type build, linebacker build, or I'd say lineman build.
[02:54:56.020 --> 02:54:59.602]  And then they were trying to grab at that huge bullhorn and trying to rip it down.
[02:54:59.602 --> 02:55:03.744]  And then I had this mega bullhorn people had to carry with a headset bullhorning.
[02:55:03.744 --> 02:55:05.845]  Totally took over MSNBC.
[02:55:07.401 --> 02:55:15.576]  If you're listening on the radio at InfoWars.com, I'm talking about visual things here because we're also now simulcasting the last two hours of the show every single day.
[02:55:16.664 --> 02:55:19.005]  at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:55:19.005 --> 02:55:24.508]  Now, coming up after the break, let's go ahead and give folks a shot of our guests that are here in studio.
[02:55:24.508 --> 02:55:28.049]  We have Barry Cooper and his wife, Candy.
[02:55:28.049 --> 02:55:36.514]  I don't think I have time to set up another mic because I thought it was just you, but hopefully we'll be able to hear from her as well here on air because she
[02:55:37.594 --> 02:55:41.075]  He goes out there and runs these stings on police with you and has a lot of courage.
[02:55:41.075 --> 02:55:52.779]  Of course, you're a former narcotics officer yourself, and of the thousands out there fighting police corruption and trying to end some of the drug prohibition that's going on that's destroying our nation, you're the best known.
[02:55:52.779 --> 02:55:56.160]  You're also a filmmaker, so we have a lot in common.
[02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:59.101]  It is good to have him here with us in studio.
[02:55:59.101 --> 02:56:03.183]  We'll start the fourth hour when we come back in 70 seconds at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:57:44.291 --> 02:57:47.313]  You know, I saw this video a few months ago.
[02:57:47.313 --> 02:57:49.635]  Somebody mailed me a copy.
[02:57:49.635 --> 02:57:52.817]  And I should have gotten it in the InfoWars.com shopping cart.
[02:57:52.817 --> 02:58:02.765]  I want to talk before you leave today about getting these in bulk from you and selling them on our online video bookstore because this is right along the lines of everything we do here fighting tyranny and corruption.
[02:58:04.411 --> 02:58:05.894]  It's Never Get Busted.

[02:58:09.283 --> 02:58:11.548]  And we're going to put that up on site.
[02:58:12.952 --> 02:58:15.134]  I'm on the screen for you.
[02:58:15.134 --> 02:58:16.295]  You have done so much.
[02:58:16.295 --> 02:58:32.607]  I think the best way to start is tell our listeners a little bit about yourself, your career in law enforcement, why you got disillusioned, and then some of the amazing exploits for freedom and liberty that you and many other officers, by the way, are out there now exposing corruption.
[02:58:32.607 --> 02:58:33.988]  So it's great to have you here with us.
[02:58:33.988 --> 02:58:34.849]  Hey, thanks.
[02:58:34.849 --> 02:58:35.990]  It's great to be here.
[02:58:35.990 --> 02:58:37.992]  Beautiful studio.
[02:58:37.992 --> 02:58:39.112]  To answer the questions,
[02:58:40.546 --> 02:58:46.590]  I was eight years a narcotics officer in West Texas and East Texas.
[02:58:46.590 --> 02:58:52.473]  My bosses in recent interviews called me one of the top narcotics officers in the nation.
[02:58:52.473 --> 02:58:57.315]  I don't believe that, but I'll take that if that's what I need to get people to listen.
[02:58:57.315 --> 02:59:02.218]  I was involved in over 100 search warrants.
[02:59:02.218 --> 02:59:06.700]  I personally arrested over 800 people for drugs.
[02:59:06.700 --> 02:59:08.862]  I seized numerous autos and
[02:59:09.898 --> 02:59:12.280]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.
[02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:16.704]  I worked joint operations with the FBI, the DEA, U.S.
[02:59:16.704 --> 02:59:18.126]  Border Patrol, and U.S.
[02:59:18.126 --> 02:59:19.287]  military.
[02:59:19.287 --> 02:59:23.971]  There's not any part of the drug scene in America that I didn't see.
[02:59:23.971 --> 02:59:32.940]  I got disillusioned with the drug war, and years later, I realized that the harms the drug war was causing
[02:59:33.444 --> 02:59:43.126]  was more harm than the drugs themselves and I was involved in some of the corruption and I did what every man's supposed to do and that's to fix your errors.
[02:59:43.126 --> 02:59:45.907]  So I released these two videos.
[02:59:45.907 --> 02:59:47.967]  Two years ago I released one.
[02:59:47.967 --> 02:59:58.970]  Last year we released the other one and I teach all the secrets that our government taught me on how to put good citizens in a cage and I teach how to counter
[03:00:01.129 --> 03:00:03.392]  Those measures that they use against citizens.
[03:00:04.795 --> 03:00:14.578]  Coming off the success of that, Candy and I were in one of our CEO board meetings, which consists of us in our bedroom, pillow-talking.
[03:00:14.578 --> 03:00:20.300]  And Candy said, you know, actually I was crying because of all the lives I had ruined.
[03:00:20.300 --> 03:00:21.400]  And I've got a nice family.
[03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:26.541]  I've got four kids, 16-year-old daughter starts Austin Community College.
[03:00:26.541 --> 03:00:28.402]  So we're big on family and education.
[03:00:28.402 --> 03:00:29.522]  That's right, you're an Austinite.
[03:00:29.522 --> 03:00:30.123]  Yes, yes.
[03:00:30.123 --> 03:00:31.303]  We just moved to Austin.
[03:00:32.183 --> 03:00:36.044]  Five months ago, yeah, to launch Copbusters.
[03:00:36.044 --> 03:00:38.265]  And you worked in Texas before in your career?
[03:00:38.265 --> 03:00:40.725]  Yes, sir, out in Odessa, Texas.
[03:00:40.725 --> 03:00:45.347]  Well, let's first get into how you got disillusioned, how you woke up to what's happening.
[03:00:45.347 --> 03:00:54.349]  I mean, there's the basic facts out there for folks to be aware of that the drug war just gets bigger and bigger and more drugs are on the streets.
[03:00:54.349 --> 03:00:59.110]  And we've gone from less than a million in prison to over four million in prison and millions on parole.
[03:00:59.110 --> 03:01:00.651]  It just gets worse and worse and worse.
[03:01:01.448 --> 03:01:13.213]  That's right, even the DEA will admit that we have more people in jail than ever before for drugs, yet we have more drugs on the street that are more potent than ever before at a cheaper price.
[03:01:13.213 --> 03:01:20.495]  So the drug war has failed to the tune of placing good human beings, millions, in a cage.
[03:01:20.495 --> 03:01:26.518]  You know, every 38 seconds, somebody in America gets placed in a cage for pot crimes.
[03:01:27.538 --> 03:01:39.709]  So, we're fighting that, and we wanted to expose the corruption in the drug war, because our email box stayed slammed with people saying, please help me, there are corrupt cops in my town.
[03:01:39.709 --> 03:01:45.675]  So, Candy said, honey, why don't you, you know, you were good at busting citizens, why don't you start stinging the cops?
[03:01:45.675 --> 03:01:46.336]  So it was her idea?
[03:01:46.336 --> 03:01:48.077]  Yeah, it was her idea.
[03:01:48.077 --> 03:01:51.300]  Six months later, we had our first cop stung in Odessa.
[03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:52.842]  We set a trap for them, and it worked.
[03:01:53.402 --> 03:02:01.067]  I want to come back in a long segment and talk more about those stings and one recently that made international news that you ran and how you did those.
[03:02:01.067 --> 03:02:11.734]  I mean, I should have had you in here for two or three hours, but the good news is you live in Austin, and so I'd like to have you in every month or so to give us reports on the latest stuff you're doing, because this is just so exciting.
[03:02:11.734 --> 03:02:22.982]  And we can spend ten hours just on all the riveting stories of these stings that you've run and, of course, the films that you've made about it and how the public can protect themselves under the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:02:22.982 --> 03:02:23.302]  Stay with us.
[03:02:23.302 --> 03:02:23.482]  Yes.
[03:02:42.611 --> 03:02:43.813]  If you simply prepare.
[03:02:43.813 --> 03:02:47.537]  Our elected representatives wanted a good ol' boy bailout for the special interest.
[03:02:47.537 --> 03:02:49.600]  So they ignored your screams not to do it.
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:51.442]  They turned off the telephones and email.
[03:02:51.442 --> 03:02:55.408]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[03:02:55.408 --> 03:02:57.851]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[03:02:58.211 --> 03:03:07.356]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[03:03:07.356 --> 03:03:14.439]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days, until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[03:03:14.439 --> 03:03:18.902]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[03:03:18.902 --> 03:03:21.123]  The private banks merging with our government.
[03:03:21.263 --> 03:03:24.584]  ...are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[03:03:24.584 --> 03:03:27.825]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[03:03:27.825 --> 03:03:31.186]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[03:03:31.186 --> 03:03:33.007]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[03:03:33.007 --> 03:03:36.708]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[03:03:37.068 --> 03:03:41.189]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[03:03:41.189 --> 03:03:48.731]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order, has a lot less control over you.
[03:03:48.731 --> 03:03:52.672]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[03:03:52.672 --> 03:03:55.893]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:03:55.893 --> 03:04:02.775]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:04:02.895 --> 03:04:06.157]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:04:06.157 --> 03:04:11.320]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.

[03:04:22.627 --> 03:04:23.328]  Take action today.
[03:04:23.328 --> 03:04:25.149]  The first step is getting storable food.
[03:04:34.662 --> 03:04:41.312]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:04:41.312 --> 03:04:44.277]  It's Alex Jones, and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:04:57.731 --> 03:05:05.096]  Barry Cooper, NeverGetBusted.com, Copbusters, and his wife, who is part of the dynamic duo, Candy.
[03:05:05.096 --> 03:05:16.243]  Again, in the time we have, go back to why you were crying, why you were upset, why you were feeling bad about what you were involved with, what that basic corruption was, and then boil down some of those stings.
[03:05:16.243 --> 03:05:25.409]  I was upset and crying because I've got four kids that I see every day and we're big on family, and then I remember the look
[03:05:26.529 --> 03:05:28.190]  We're good to go.
[03:05:46.744 --> 03:06:03.523]  You know that didn't go away just because I left that house that person's marked forever with that terror and I was on the other end of a civil raid and I remember the terrorizing effect that had on my kids so I kind of got a taste of my own medicine and candy
[03:06:04.864 --> 03:06:16.995]  You know, I was drinking a lot of vodka then, like most yuppie business type guys do, but I was drinking too much and she would come out and bring me pot and say, here, smoke this.
[03:06:16.995 --> 03:06:20.378]  And I would smoke that and not want the alcohol any longer.
[03:06:20.378 --> 03:06:28.585]  And that's why a lot of officers just interrupt, end up being alcoholics, the highest statistic in that profession, because it is a stressful, crazy job.
[03:06:29.315 --> 03:06:30.276]  Yeah, it's horrible.
[03:06:30.276 --> 03:06:32.898]  But that's not an excuse either, you know.
[03:06:32.898 --> 03:06:37.042]  But my point is, candy helped me get off the alcohol and I started smoking pot.
[03:06:37.042 --> 03:06:38.303]  So marijuana helped you?
[03:06:38.303 --> 03:06:38.784]  Helped me.
[03:06:38.784 --> 03:06:41.746]  It does something for me.
[03:06:41.746 --> 03:06:49.814]  It made me a more compassionate person and I stopped and slowed down long enough to realize the harms that I was creating on this earth instead of helping.
[03:06:50.233 --> 03:06:54.635]  Plus he was much nicer when he smoked.
[03:06:54.635 --> 03:06:59.277]  So I married my pot dealer.
[03:06:59.277 --> 03:07:05.260]  And then I got on the internet and I started reading the statistics and what was really happening with this drug war.
[03:07:05.720 --> 03:07:12.782]  And I started remembering back to the corruption I was involved in, planting drugs on people, lying on search warrants, stealing money.
[03:07:12.782 --> 03:07:13.622]  And that's standard now.
[03:07:13.622 --> 03:07:14.303]  That's standard now.
[03:07:14.303 --> 03:07:26.446]  I mean, not just Tulia, Texas, planting cocaine on 50-plus black people, not just Houston framing more than 4,000 people, Houston Chronicle, not just the FBI crime lab saying it was standard just to frame everybody.
[03:07:26.446 --> 03:07:29.387]  I mean, this is the norm, not the exception.
[03:07:29.387 --> 03:07:30.947]  That's exactly right.
[03:07:30.947 --> 03:07:32.128]  How did they induct you into that?
[03:07:33.107 --> 03:07:40.092]  I believed what I was doing was right when I was planning the drugs and lying on search warrants.
[03:07:40.092 --> 03:07:44.195]  Because my parents raised me, anybody that does drugs is evil.
[03:07:44.195 --> 03:07:47.037]  And the school reinforced that when I went to school.
[03:07:47.037 --> 03:07:50.159]  But it's okay to drink vodka or take Prozac.
[03:07:50.459 --> 03:07:51.060]  It's not.
[03:07:51.060 --> 03:07:52.281]  It's better to smoke pot.
[03:07:52.281 --> 03:07:52.862]  But exactly.
[03:07:52.862 --> 03:07:59.830]  I'm saying they push all these really dangerous drugs but then go after marijuana because that's 86% of people that use drugs only use that.
[03:07:59.830 --> 03:08:01.011]  Without that, their drug war is over.
[03:08:01.011 --> 03:08:01.472]  But go ahead.
[03:08:01.472 --> 03:08:01.872]  That's right.
[03:08:01.872 --> 03:08:03.174]  You're exactly right.
[03:08:03.174 --> 03:08:04.655]  And the church reinforced it.
[03:08:04.655 --> 03:08:05.676]  You know, went to church and
[03:08:06.417 --> 03:08:15.366]  And so by the time I was a young man and the government got a hold of me in the police academy, they even reinforced those beliefs more.
[03:08:15.366 --> 03:08:18.308]  So I believed that I was serving the greater good.
[03:08:18.308 --> 03:08:24.694]  I didn't realize that breaking constitutional law and taking freedoms away from people was causing more harm.
[03:08:24.694 --> 03:08:29.919]  I really believed at the time that all the corruption I was involved in was helping
[03:08:30.840 --> 03:08:58.551]  uh... helping the the movement and that was to get drugs out of america ronald reagan was one of my heroes you know kevin booth i sell his film the drug war film that proves ronald reagan was involved in that in smuggling the cocaine you know i was arresting people of ronald reagan crack in their pockets and it's just kind of the the oz the oz screen fell and what i thought was this big powerful american voice turned out to be a little bald headed
[03:09:01.452 --> 03:09:08.536]  Well, you know, the British 160 years ago used opium importation to take control of China instead of a police state and then overthrow it.
[03:09:08.536 --> 03:09:15.619]  So this is really a formula to bring down a nation as a pretext to bring in the military, which they now use in drug interdiction inside the country.
[03:09:15.619 --> 03:09:16.680]  Well, it's worked.
[03:09:16.680 --> 03:09:18.361]  Look where our country is right now.
[03:09:18.361 --> 03:09:23.423]  They're successful at scaring the American people.
[03:09:23.423 --> 03:09:29.046]  And hopefully our efforts will help fix some of that by exposing these cops on camera.
[03:09:30.146 --> 03:09:31.127]  Absolutely.
[03:09:31.127 --> 03:09:42.337]  You know what, if you guys don't have somewhere to go in 45 minutes, we're live on the radio, the shortwave, everywhere, but we'll be just PrisonPlanet.tv and internet, but then that gets ripped to the web and millions see it in the aggregate.
[03:09:42.337 --> 03:09:48.103]  Maybe we can do 15-20 minutes into overdrive so we have plenty of time to cover all this and play some video clips from your film.
[03:09:48.103 --> 03:09:49.003]  We'd love to stay.
[03:09:49.003 --> 03:09:50.785]  We're honored.
[03:09:50.785 --> 03:09:51.886]  I thought you lived in North Texas.
[03:09:51.886 --> 03:09:54.909]  I'm glad to hear you're in Austin now, because I'm a big fan of what you're doing.
[03:09:55.049 --> 03:09:55.509]  Okay, great.
[03:09:55.509 --> 03:09:57.030]  We're big fans of yours.
[03:09:57.030 --> 03:10:05.396]  Our email box is full of people saying you've got to get on the Alex Jones Radio Show, and we don't solicit our own interviews.
[03:10:05.396 --> 03:10:06.196]  We have done two.
[03:10:06.196 --> 03:10:09.398]  But it's good that we ended up contacting you, so that was synchronicity.
[03:10:09.398 --> 03:10:10.299]  Oh, it was great.
[03:10:10.299 --> 03:10:11.740]  That was great, Alex.
[03:10:11.740 --> 03:10:12.320]  Yeah, thanks.
[03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:12.701]  Okay.
[03:10:12.701 --> 03:10:15.462]  Now, I mean, there's so much to talk about here.
[03:10:17.344 --> 03:10:21.185]  On the screen we were showing video of you up in a helicopter over pot fields.
[03:10:21.185 --> 03:10:22.226]  What was that?
[03:10:22.226 --> 03:10:32.389]  Well, Candy is our public relations manager and she got a call actually two days before she got the call from Channel 33 News.
[03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:42.052]  We were pillow talking having another one of our meetings and I said our second film, Never Get Raided, we got to teach people how to grow pot and sell pot and not get busted.
[03:10:43.032 --> 03:10:46.633]  Liquor dealers are allowed to sell theirs, and they don't get raided at 3 in the morning.
[03:10:46.633 --> 03:10:54.537]  I said, well, the most expensive part of this project will be to raise the money to rent a helicopter, because I have a certificate from the DEA.
[03:10:54.537 --> 03:11:05.561]  They taught me how to fly around and spot marijuana fields, and I was going to fly around, find a real clandestine marijuana field, sneak the film crew in, and explain what the growers did wrong from the ground.
[03:11:06.141 --> 03:11:07.903]  For me to spot it from the air.
[03:11:07.903 --> 03:11:18.972]  Two days later, Channel 33 from Dallas called Candy and said, you know, the DEA just busted seven huge marijuana fields on Dallas City property and they're two miles through the woods.
[03:11:18.972 --> 03:11:20.774]  No reporters will go into the fields.
[03:11:20.774 --> 03:11:23.537]  Do you think Barry would go up in a helicopter with us?
[03:11:23.537 --> 03:11:27.880]  We find the fields and sneak them in, you know, sneak us in for an interview.
[03:11:28.621 --> 03:11:30.342]  Candy said, well of course.
[03:11:30.342 --> 03:11:34.003]  I'll call you right back.
[03:11:34.003 --> 03:11:37.885]  So within a week, we were in the helicopter.
[03:11:37.885 --> 03:11:39.545]  Candy and I snuck the film crew in.
[03:11:39.545 --> 03:11:42.567]  They got their interview for Channel 33.
[03:11:42.567 --> 03:11:45.948]  And then I remembered where the patch was from the air.
[03:11:45.948 --> 03:11:49.549]  So when we were finished with that, we snuck our film crew back in.
[03:11:49.549 --> 03:11:55.232]  And that's where I give the instructions that you see right now on how not to get busted for growing pot.
[03:11:55.232 --> 03:11:58.033]  And that was a field the DEA had busted a week before.
[03:11:59.190 --> 03:12:03.235]  Amazing, and the film's just full of stuff like that.
[03:12:03.235 --> 03:12:07.660]  How do police officers that are still narcotics officers, how do they on average respond to you?
[03:12:07.660 --> 03:12:15.629]  I know there's thousands and thousands of police that have joined an organization that is former narcotics officers against prohibition.
[03:12:15.629 --> 03:12:19.493]  Yes, LEAP.CC, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[03:12:21.013 --> 03:12:26.475]  6,500 politicians, judges, and police are saying the same thing to end the drug war.
[03:12:26.475 --> 03:12:40.338]  To answer your question, we get death threats from police, usually through emails, and I've kept those, you know, filed away safely, but they've emailed us horrible things such as, I hope, candy,
[03:12:41.784 --> 03:13:05.109]  uh... gets raped while you're in prison for releasing those films and I'll see you on the shoulder if you ever come through my jurisdiction so they're not happy about it and which is unfortunate because subconsciously they have a lot of guilt and so they need to keep the facade going of what they've done when it's a CIA aircraft last year crashed with three and a half tons of pure cocaine meaning coming from source folks
[03:13:06.049 --> 03:13:07.870]  They're caught all the time.
[03:13:07.870 --> 03:13:09.531]  They ship the majority of the drugs in.
[03:13:09.531 --> 03:13:13.372]  The drug war internationally is only against cowboys that don't launder their money with them.
[03:13:13.372 --> 03:13:24.758]  The head of the New York Stock Exchange back in 1999 flew to Colombia and met on TV with the head of the FARC and said, invest your drug money with us or we're going to invade your country.
[03:13:24.758 --> 03:13:29.460]  There's an international loophole where drug money internationally is allowed to be invested in U.S.
[03:13:29.460 --> 03:13:29.760]  banks.
[03:13:30.180 --> 03:13:32.461]  That's how open their drug dealing is.
[03:13:32.461 --> 03:13:37.183]  They ship it in, but that isn't enough to keep it illegal so they get big profits.
[03:13:37.183 --> 03:13:41.324]  Then, they get all the incredible profits on the ground in the name of fighting the drugs.
[03:13:41.324 --> 03:13:43.345]  And police, you can't deny that anymore.
[03:13:43.345 --> 03:13:46.126]  I mean, it's been in Esquire Magazine, it's been on ABC News.
[03:13:46.126 --> 03:13:50.368]  I mean, it's on record that the majority of narcotics are shipped in here by the federal government.
[03:13:50.368 --> 03:13:50.908]  That's right.
[03:13:50.908 --> 03:13:55.030]  And we spend $90 billion a year now in this war on drugs.
[03:13:55.550 --> 03:14:10.474]  And they still are using the propaganda to make us believe that this country will go crazy if we legalize the drugs when the truth is we give millions of citizens every day doses of heroin in the form of Oxycontin
[03:14:10.894 --> 03:14:11.494]  We're good.
[03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:30.341]  Reuptake inhibitors or Prozac class alone.
[03:14:30.341 --> 03:14:32.902]  One hundred million on the insert of that drug.
[03:14:32.902 --> 03:14:42.265]  It says it's in the hallucinogen, psychotropic class and puts you into a dream state and is highly toxic to the brain and body and creates psychotic breaks, suicidal tendencies.
[03:14:42.265 --> 03:14:45.426]  It's all in the literature that comes with the drug.
[03:14:45.426 --> 03:14:47.386]  Meanwhile, no one dies of marijuana.
[03:14:47.386 --> 03:14:48.287]  That's right.
[03:14:48.287 --> 03:14:49.487]  And by the way, folks, I'm not some
[03:14:49.807 --> 03:14:50.167]  Marijuana.
[03:15:07.395 --> 03:15:28.041]  By opiates, by speed, by cocaine, Coca-Cola had cocaine in it, and we had about one-tenth, and you can go look at the statistics of Americans using those drugs that are now, by making it illegal, it makes it taboo, makes it profitable, just like alcoholism tripled under the ten years of prohibition back in the twenties, and energized the mafia, corrupted the police,
[03:15:28.661 --> 03:15:30.641]  The very same drug dealers.
[03:15:30.641 --> 03:15:37.443]  Skull & Bones is run by the British Yersinia Company, that's Mainline News, founded by that company that had the world opium monopoly.
[03:15:37.443 --> 03:15:41.764]  By the 20's they'd lost their world monopoly and the papers are now declassified.
[03:15:41.764 --> 03:15:50.985]  They lobbied to make drugs illegal so they could jack up the price several thousand percentage points and then use it to corrupt police on top of their profits.
[03:15:50.985 --> 03:15:52.786]  Because they'd done that, again,
[03:15:53.886 --> 03:15:56.487]  Then 80 years before in China.
[03:15:56.487 --> 03:15:57.968]  And I know I keep going back to that.
[03:15:57.968 --> 03:15:59.228]  This is a program.
[03:15:59.228 --> 03:16:03.470]  It is and it's sad because we forget about our prisoners.
[03:16:03.470 --> 03:16:08.332]  Listen, to go into a cage, pretend like you're snatched right now into a cage.
[03:16:08.332 --> 03:16:17.976]  The concrete floors in those prisons and jails, they've been urinated on so much, the urine smells there, the food is horrible, you get a bologna sandwich.
[03:16:18.576 --> 03:16:19.337]  Stay there.
[03:16:19.337 --> 03:16:21.460]  We're going to come back and get more into this.
[03:16:21.460 --> 03:16:24.263]  We're going to go into overdrive today, folks, for a half hour.
[03:16:24.263 --> 03:16:28.948]  So for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and internet listeners at InfoWars.com, the show will continue.

[03:17:33.423 --> 03:17:39.147]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[03:17:39.147 --> 03:17:40.468]  And we knew what to do.
[03:17:40.468 --> 03:17:42.470]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:17:42.470 --> 03:17:48.794]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:17:49.491 --> 03:17:58.396]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.

[03:20:15.991 --> 03:20:17.092]  Our memories live on in mortal minds.
[03:20:44.555 --> 03:20:56.495]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[03:20:56.495 --> 03:20:58.538]  I make a living off the land.
[03:21:02.011 --> 03:21:17.740]  Barry Cooper's Never Get Busted Again, Volume 2, Never Get Raided, former top narcotics officer, over 800 felony and misdemeanor narcotics arrest, former K-9 instructor, trained by the DEA,
[03:21:19.451 --> 03:21:21.193]  Here's volume one, traffic stops.
[03:21:21.193 --> 03:21:26.819]  Barry Cooper is a hero because he is standing up and declaring the war on drugs is not working.
[03:21:26.819 --> 03:21:28.020]  This is Tucker Carlson, MSNBC.
[03:21:31.596 --> 03:21:39.858]  We're going to go into overdrive today and an additional bonus 30 minutes for everybody viewing and listening when the main radio show ends in about 35 minutes.
[03:21:39.858 --> 03:21:42.659]  But I wanted to go ahead now and play the trailer.
[03:21:42.659 --> 03:21:44.980]  I forget which one, which trailer are we about to play?
[03:21:44.980 --> 03:21:48.381]  It should be the trailer to Copbusters Episode 1.
[03:21:48.381 --> 03:21:48.821]  Okay.
[03:21:48.821 --> 03:21:50.682]  It's on copbusters.com.
[03:21:50.682 --> 03:21:51.302]  Okay.
[03:21:51.302 --> 03:22:00.025]  So we're going to go ahead and punch that trailer up right now and play that trailer from Copbusters for everybody that is out there watching.
[03:22:00.025 --> 03:22:00.905]  Are we ready with that trailer?
[03:22:01.705 --> 03:22:05.630]  Uh, here we go.
[03:22:29.947 --> 03:22:34.989]  On June 3rd, 2004, a letter found out she'd been charged with possession of methamphetamines.
[03:22:34.989 --> 03:22:44.714]  Found out that she had been set up, that drugs had been planted on her by an informant at the behest of Officer Gregory Traven of the Odessa Police Department.
[03:22:44.714 --> 03:22:48.936]  Officer Traven took him from the Odessa Police Department over to the apartment.
[03:22:48.936 --> 03:22:52.818]  He met with Yolanda, planted drugs on Yolanda, and then Officer Traven
[03:22:53.513 --> 03:23:00.039]  Followed her to her next stop, Albertsons, and then had the police officer pull her over at Albertsons' parking lot, and that's where she was arrested.
[03:23:00.039 --> 03:23:04.723]  He testified that they told him to make sure she takes this back.
[03:23:04.723 --> 03:23:14.252]  When we called him, trying to find out what we could do about all this injustice, he's told us, me and my mother, he said the police got the wrong person.
[03:23:14.252 --> 03:23:17.775]  They thought she was somebody else, but once they made the
[03:23:19.239 --> 03:23:21.260]  The bus, they had to go through with it.
[03:23:21.260 --> 03:23:24.923]  I mean, once you plant drugs, you can't say, oh, excuse me, we planted drugs.
[03:23:24.923 --> 03:23:33.008]  I reached out to Barry Saluk, and I told him all the predicaments that we was in, Mr. Madden and I, the case, Shalonda Madden, and things that were going on.
[03:23:33.008 --> 03:23:41.853]  And I told him, there has to be some type of program, some type of entity out there that can come in and investigate these officers.
[03:23:41.853 --> 03:23:45.395]  Basically, I've gone through the system.
[03:23:45.395 --> 03:23:47.977]  So what I had to do is I reached out to Copbusters.
[03:23:49.656 --> 03:24:15.793]  Kenny and I, my wife, brought a team of detectives into Odessa to set a trap to bust crooked cops in Odessa that planted drugs on his daughter, Yolanda Madden, and she is now serving an eight year prison sentence.
[03:24:15.793 --> 03:24:17.574]  Our attorney was inside.
[03:24:17.574 --> 03:24:19.055]  They handcuffed our attorney.
[03:24:19.898 --> 03:24:33.454]  And then when they realized nothing was illegal, when they had messed up, they released our attorney.
[03:24:33.454 --> 03:24:40.742]  I'm doing this for the attention of that girl that's in prison and the million non-violent drug prisoners we have in prison right now.
[03:24:48.974 --> 03:24:57.642]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, and the police with big smirks on their faces, caught red-handed trying to engage in these activities.
[03:24:57.642 --> 03:25:04.488]  It is the norm to plant drugs, and more and more with hidden cameras people are catching police at roadside checkpoints, you name it.
[03:25:04.488 --> 03:25:10.233]  How do they morally get to the point where they think it's good to send somebody away for 5, 10, 20 years?
[03:25:10.233 --> 03:25:11.694]  Unlike the case in Tulea, Texas.
[03:25:17.036 --> 03:25:34.581]  I don't have an answer for it except it is evil and I was part of that corruption and like I said earlier I believe what I was doing was right but I was a young kid and it doesn't take much maturity and much research to learn that all that's wrong.
[03:25:35.734 --> 03:25:38.635]  All the cops doing the drug war should switch, like I did.
[03:25:38.635 --> 03:25:43.996]  We're about to break, but what was the first time that you were a narcotics officer and suddenly said, this is how we do it?
[03:25:43.996 --> 03:25:48.317]  I mean, do they teach planning drugs in the academy courses?
[03:25:48.317 --> 03:25:58.980]  They don't teach that in the academy, but when you get on the street with the training partner, if he senses that he can trust you and you're one of them, then they start showing those inside ropes.
[03:26:00.600 --> 03:26:02.121]  Of course they don't announce publicly.
[03:26:02.121 --> 03:26:04.142]  And it's a sick gang mentality culture.
[03:26:04.142 --> 03:26:06.563]  It's sick what they're doing, but it's, oh, it's a brotherhood.
[03:26:06.563 --> 03:26:09.925]  Just like the Eastside Vatos have the sick code, so do the police.
[03:26:09.925 --> 03:26:17.068]  I want to ask when we come back, what percentage of units that you worked in and around are planning drugs on people?
[03:26:17.068 --> 03:26:18.729]  I would guess it's the majority.
[03:26:18.729 --> 03:26:19.950]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:26:19.950 --> 03:26:23.532]  Long segment coming up, right here on GCN.
[03:26:23.532 --> 03:26:24.932]  We're on the march.
[03:26:24.932 --> 03:26:27.454]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:26:27.454 --> 03:26:30.155]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:26:33.602 --> 03:26:37.306]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[03:26:37.306 --> 03:26:43.052]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[03:26:43.052 --> 03:26:47.376]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[03:26:47.376 --> 03:26:49.839]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[03:26:49.839 --> 03:26:55.805]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.
[03:26:55.905 --> 03:26:56.645]  We're good to go!
[03:27:25.080 --> 03:27:27.942]  GoldenFLAX.com or call 800-387-5516.
[03:27:27.942 --> 03:27:28.862]  That's 800-387-5516.
[03:27:28.862 --> 03:27:33.004]  Free shipping included.
[03:27:33.004 --> 03:27:40.388]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:27:40.388 --> 03:27:42.049]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:27:43.041 --> 03:27:44.581]  But who is the enemy?
[03:27:44.581 --> 03:27:45.362]  Bin Laden.
[03:27:45.362 --> 03:27:46.382]  This is his M.O.
[03:27:46.382 --> 03:27:47.702]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:27:47.702 --> 03:27:49.743]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:27:49.743 --> 03:27:56.885]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:27:56.885 --> 03:27:57.365]  Some U.S.
[03:27:57.365 --> 03:28:03.027]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:28:03.707 --> 03:28:07.590]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:17.697]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:28:17.697 --> 03:28:18.918]  Fabled enemies.
[03:28:18.918 --> 03:28:26.643]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:28:26.643 --> 03:28:30.046]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:28:33.587 --> 03:28:33.948]  I think so.
[03:28:53.025 --> 03:29:02.250]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[03:29:02.250 --> 03:29:06.052]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[03:29:06.052 --> 03:29:10.854]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[03:29:10.854 --> 03:29:11.915]  Do your part.
[03:29:11.915 --> 03:29:14.536]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[03:29:14.536 --> 03:29:20.659]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[03:29:20.919 --> 03:29:22.120]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:29:22.120 --> 03:29:22.480]  to 3 p.m.
[03:29:22.480 --> 03:29:23.340]  Central Standard Time.
[03:29:43.288 --> 03:29:47.850]  The Infowar has launched a new weapon in the assault against tyranny.
[03:29:47.850 --> 03:29:54.392]  The PrisonPlanet.tv live simulcast where this radio show turns into a television show.
[03:29:54.392 --> 03:29:59.134]  We've been doing this for two weeks now in the new studio, about eight months total.
[03:29:59.134 --> 03:30:02.015]  And again, the good news for all the viewers out there is it's having an effect.
[03:30:02.495 --> 03:30:10.604]  These TV programs on YouTube, every week alone from a few channels we're looking at the numbers on, over a million people tuning in and watching it.
[03:30:10.604 --> 03:30:16.009]  So that is something added to the two million radio listeners per show.
[03:30:17.398 --> 03:30:18.518]  And then just everything else.
[03:30:18.518 --> 03:30:30.642]  And the reason I keep plugging that is this is exciting because we're exponentially growing and reaching new people with this information and then meeting and finding new folks that have just done so many other incredible things.
[03:30:30.642 --> 03:30:34.923]  You know, I guess I'm a guy for your heart, you're a guy for my heart because these stings, these exposing things.
[03:30:34.923 --> 03:30:36.323]  I've done these on the military.
[03:30:36.323 --> 03:30:43.145]  I've done these on world leaders with satanic activities with the Bohemian Grove, which is an offshoot of Skull and Bones.
[03:30:43.145 --> 03:30:44.766]  And then I've seen one of your films.
[03:30:45.826 --> 03:30:48.507]  Just today, seeing all this other footage, it's amazing.
[03:30:48.507 --> 03:31:04.111]  Now let's finish up with how this planting drugs works, answering the question of what percentage of police departments and units you believe are planting drugs, and then let's get into this latest sting you ran that made international headlines.
[03:31:04.111 --> 03:31:08.292]  85% are planting drugs would be my guess, and I'm probably under-guessing.
[03:31:09.926 --> 03:31:13.648]  And the public has no idea of this just unbelievable systemic corruption?
[03:31:13.648 --> 03:31:28.715]  The public knows, but for some reason, like my parents and grandparents trusted politicians to protect our freedoms, it seems like the younger generation have realized it's up to the citizenry to get our freedoms back.
[03:31:28.715 --> 03:31:31.116]  Now going back to the department, where were you?
[03:31:31.116 --> 03:31:32.116]  Where were you working?
[03:31:32.116 --> 03:31:34.518]  I mean, did you immediately as an officer become a narcotics officer?
[03:31:34.518 --> 03:31:35.238]  How did that happen?
[03:31:35.238 --> 03:31:37.279]  And then what was the first time they said, let's plant drugs?
[03:31:39.337 --> 03:31:43.579]  I basically overwhelmed law enforcement pretty fast.
[03:31:43.579 --> 03:31:50.504]  I climbed, in the first year I already had my own drug dog that I was training for narcotics.
[03:31:50.504 --> 03:31:51.425]  And where was that?
[03:31:51.425 --> 03:31:53.826]  That was Big Sandy Police Department.
[03:31:53.826 --> 03:32:01.811]  I made over 100 drug arrests in a year and a half on only 5 miles of highway with my new drug dog.
[03:32:01.811 --> 03:32:06.835]  And that's what got the attention of the Permian Basin Drug Task Force out in West Texas.
[03:32:07.755 --> 03:32:18.688]  They were under the TNCP program, Texas Narcotics Control Program, and it was there at the Permian Basin Drug Task Force where I learned to do all of these corrupt things.
[03:32:18.688 --> 03:32:19.970]  And give us a case point example.
[03:32:21.706 --> 03:32:36.836]  Probably one of the things that we repeated over and over is we claimed an informant saw drugs in somebody's house and that was enough probable cause for a search warrant when the truth is an informant had never been in the house to see the drugs.
[03:32:36.836 --> 03:32:47.624]  We called it a ghost informant and we knew being on a local state level our informants did not have to show up in court and testify like they do a lot in federal court so we were protected.
[03:32:47.624 --> 03:32:48.985]  So no right to face the accuser?
[03:32:49.585 --> 03:32:55.818]  Right, we lied on the search warrants claiming a confidential informant saw the drugs when they didn't.
[03:32:55.818 --> 03:32:58.324]  And what would you do then with the drug planting?
[03:33:00.025 --> 03:33:04.487]  Most of the drug planning took place through an informant.
[03:33:04.487 --> 03:33:14.150]  We would pull over somebody on the highway and arrest them for drugs, and explain to them if they did three deals for us, that we wouldn't file this case.
[03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:17.631]  And the three deals means to set somebody up for drugs.
[03:33:17.631 --> 03:33:28.955]  And the informants would actually go into the house, hide the drugs in the cushion of a couch, come back out and tell us, hey, I just saw drugs in their house, and we would raid it.
[03:33:29.375 --> 03:33:32.578]  The entire time the informant was the one who put the drugs in there.
[03:33:32.578 --> 03:33:33.278]  Very common.
[03:33:33.278 --> 03:33:34.559]  And you wouldn't feel bad.
[03:33:34.559 --> 03:33:35.640]  I mean, later you did.
[03:33:35.640 --> 03:33:41.244]  It was great to just go ruin somebody's life, to just go in and because we're good guys fighting drugs, planting drugs.
[03:33:41.244 --> 03:33:44.346]  I guess the excuse was, we think this person is a drug dealer.
[03:33:44.346 --> 03:33:45.908]  Well, we couldn't catch them.
[03:33:45.908 --> 03:33:51.532]  We really believed they were a drug dealer and we couldn't catch them using the legal ways.
[03:33:51.532 --> 03:33:54.454]  So we crossed those lines and lied.
[03:33:54.454 --> 03:33:55.415]  And it's sad.
[03:33:55.415 --> 03:33:57.556]  I didn't feel bad for what I was doing then.
[03:33:58.297 --> 03:34:03.279]  Like I said, I believed I was doing the greater good, but I feel horrible about it now.
[03:34:03.279 --> 03:34:06.761]  But during that period, though, you did wake up.
[03:34:06.761 --> 03:34:11.003]  Yes, it was about three months before I quit law enforcement.
[03:34:11.003 --> 03:34:23.089]  I started noticing some things, and I quit law enforcement after I arrested the mayor's son with methamphetamine, and I arrested a city councilman with a bag of pot and a pistol, and then I arrested
[03:34:23.829 --> 03:34:29.134]  Three crooks that the DEA had been chasing for a long time and I got them all in one sting operation.
[03:34:29.134 --> 03:34:31.576]  So that pressure pushed me out.
[03:34:31.576 --> 03:34:37.642]  I didn't realize the error of my ways until I started raising a family and met Candy.
[03:34:37.642 --> 03:34:42.506]  Yeah, and she started seeing the pain that was in me and saying, what's wrong?
[03:34:42.506 --> 03:34:47.751]  And I just start crying and tell her, you know, all these lives I'd ruined and I didn't know what to do about it.
[03:34:47.751 --> 03:34:49.553]  He was truly a mess about it.
[03:34:49.813 --> 03:35:02.821]  Yeah, so she just kept taking the alcohol away and when I'd get home in the evening I'd go back to the bedroom and smoke a joint and it took a year or so of healing and realizing and what to do next.
[03:35:02.821 --> 03:35:03.901]  Figuring things out.
[03:35:03.901 --> 03:35:07.263]  Well that's what's so incredible though about the demonization of marijuana itself.
[03:35:07.263 --> 03:35:09.585]  The apothecaries, or who the pharmacists were,
[03:35:10.405 --> 03:35:26.733]  Going back to when people were first here in the colonies over 350 years ago, it was one of the number one prescribed things by doctors, by barbers who were kind of like a sub-doctor or like a nurse, and by the apothecaries, and it was sold out of the Americas all over the world.
[03:35:26.733 --> 03:35:28.534]  Ships filled with hemp.
[03:35:28.534 --> 03:35:30.474]  They used the Mexican name marijuana.
[03:35:30.474 --> 03:35:31.135]  Like it is now.
[03:35:31.955 --> 03:35:32.996]  Absolutely.
[03:35:32.996 --> 03:35:40.361]  And George Washington, you can read the old prescriptions from his doctor for gout and for headaches and stomach aches.
[03:35:40.361 --> 03:35:43.003]  George Washington didn't just smoke marijuana.
[03:35:43.003 --> 03:35:46.105]  On his plantation, he grew marijuana.
[03:35:46.105 --> 03:35:49.547]  Not just hemp rope, that type without THC.
[03:35:49.547 --> 03:35:51.668]  He was a big pot smoker.
[03:35:51.668 --> 03:35:53.710]  Well, I ran for Congress.
[03:35:53.710 --> 03:35:56.091]  I've done live debates.
[03:35:56.091 --> 03:36:01.115]  And if anybody thinks for a second that marijuana keeps you from being a producing individual,
[03:36:01.952 --> 03:36:03.452]  Look at me and the millions of others.
[03:36:03.452 --> 03:36:10.234]  Well, my whole point is that in the thirties they had reefer madness saying you murder and kill people on pot.
[03:36:10.234 --> 03:36:13.175]  They made all these movies to demonize it.
[03:36:13.175 --> 03:36:17.075]  They changed the name to marijuana using the Spanish name so it sounded alien.
[03:36:17.075 --> 03:36:24.057]  And then they made something that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson smoked for toothaches in a pipe into something they put you in prison for.
[03:36:24.057 --> 03:36:25.137]  Exactly.
[03:36:25.137 --> 03:36:27.318]  And that's why copbusters and you and
[03:36:28.118 --> 03:36:29.459]  Never get busted or hear.
[03:36:29.459 --> 03:36:31.420]  It's a freedom issue.
[03:36:31.420 --> 03:36:33.021]  It's not just a pot issue.
[03:36:33.021 --> 03:36:35.622]  It's not if you think it's wrong or if I think it's wrong.
[03:36:35.622 --> 03:36:36.543]  It has nothing to do with that.
[03:36:36.543 --> 03:36:37.363]  It's a freedom issue.
[03:36:37.363 --> 03:36:38.984]  If I want to do it, I should be able to do it.
[03:36:38.984 --> 03:36:40.765]  If I'm not hurting someone else.
[03:36:40.765 --> 03:36:41.465]  Well, exactly.
[03:36:41.465 --> 03:36:44.447]  I'm just speaking to those out there going, listen to him saying he smokes marijuana.
[03:36:44.447 --> 03:36:44.887]  It's evil.
[03:36:44.887 --> 03:36:45.967]  It's horrible.
[03:36:45.967 --> 03:36:46.388]  It's bad.
[03:36:47.048 --> 03:36:50.071]  The only reason it could be bad is because they've made it illegal.
[03:36:50.071 --> 03:36:52.774]  It's now under that culture of other illegal drugs.
[03:36:52.774 --> 03:36:55.017]  And so when you're out buying it, you don't know if it's good.
[03:36:55.017 --> 03:36:56.118]  You don't know if it's been sprayed.
[03:36:56.118 --> 03:36:57.620]  You don't know if it's tainted.
[03:36:57.620 --> 03:36:59.542]  You don't know if Paraquad's been sprayed on it.
[03:36:59.542 --> 03:37:03.506]  And then the dealer may say, I got something else for you that is really bad.
[03:37:03.506 --> 03:37:06.990]  And see, that's why we've got to decriminalize it so that it isn't in that whole culture.
[03:37:08.166 --> 03:37:18.900]  Well it certainly needs to be switched out of the culture it's in right now, because Americans are not going to stop growing it, they're not going to stop smoking it, no matter how many of us you put in jail.
[03:37:18.900 --> 03:37:21.563]  And if there's one pot smoker in jail, we're all in jail.
[03:37:26.049 --> 03:37:27.110]  Well, that's what bothers me.
[03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:28.011]  That's what bothers me.
[03:37:28.011 --> 03:37:32.296]  People said, well, you're supposed to change the laws through... Well, I ran for Congress.
[03:37:32.296 --> 03:37:33.517]  I tried that.
[03:37:33.517 --> 03:37:34.899]  And here's the problem.
[03:37:34.899 --> 03:37:36.660]  They say, change the laws the right way.
[03:37:36.660 --> 03:37:37.621]  Don't release films.
[03:37:37.621 --> 03:37:38.522]  Don't sting cops.
[03:37:38.522 --> 03:37:42.367]  Well, every time the American people bring it up on the ballot,
[03:37:42.907 --> 03:37:46.931]  For instance, they just did this in Michigan for medical marijuana.
[03:37:46.931 --> 03:37:54.237]  The cops, the chief of police are the ones that come out and say, no, we can't do this and start the marijuana madness thing again.
[03:37:54.237 --> 03:38:01.943]  So the government and the police tell us, go through the proper channels to change the law, and then when we try, they come against it.
[03:38:01.943 --> 03:38:04.025]  So it makes absolutely no sense.
[03:38:04.025 --> 03:38:04.746]  It's not fair.
[03:38:04.746 --> 03:38:07.828]  Well, we've got to start with the ending prohibition on marijuana.
[03:38:08.729 --> 03:38:11.432]  And then taxing it and controlling it like anything else.
[03:38:11.432 --> 03:38:13.995]  I don't even like them taxing it for this reason, Alex.
[03:38:13.995 --> 03:38:16.317]  But if I can get them to at least do that... No, I would take that.
[03:38:16.317 --> 03:38:23.925]  But that's still saying, we'll pay you money, American government, if you quit putting us in jail for something we shouldn't be in jail for anyway.
[03:38:23.925 --> 03:38:30.853]  They should leave that plant alone, and if they do, it will do more good for America than all the tax money it could ever bring.
[03:38:30.913 --> 03:38:33.296]  But if they want to legalize it and tax it, we'll take that.
[03:38:33.296 --> 03:38:35.259]  Well, it's an automatic tax.
[03:38:35.259 --> 03:38:38.643]  I mean, you said $90 billion a year.
[03:38:38.643 --> 03:38:39.745]  Billion.
[03:38:39.745 --> 03:38:40.486]  Billion.
[03:38:40.486 --> 03:38:45.592]  It's already a tax cut if we stop spending that $90 billion a year.
[03:38:45.592 --> 03:38:46.353]  Yeah, good point.
[03:38:46.994 --> 03:38:50.855]  So, I mean, right there, that's $90 billion that we won't be spending.
[03:38:50.855 --> 03:39:05.918]  Now, before we run out of time here, I know we've got 30 minutes of overdrive, but for the full audience, with about 18 minutes left, let's get into, just in rapid fire, some of the worst cases of corruption and shut-ups you've seen, and then get into your latest sting.
[03:39:05.918 --> 03:39:13.979]  The worst cases of corruption would be those where we put people in jail when the informant planted the drugs and or we lied on the search warrant.
[03:39:14.711 --> 03:39:31.091]  and or we caused our dog to false alert when they refused consent so we could search their car or taking an eight ball of cocaine out of my pocket as an officer and sticking it in another man's pocket that's handcuffed
[03:39:31.758 --> 03:39:53.169]  And telling him if he doesn't call me within 24 hours to set somebody else up on a drug bust, that eight ball of cocaine was going to be his, then I would take the eight ball of cocaine out of his pocket and put it back in mine, and within 24 hours he would call me because he was so scared that I would plant that eight ball on him.
[03:39:53.169 --> 03:39:54.969]  Terrorizing Americans.
[03:39:54.969 --> 03:39:57.851]  Well, before we get into that sting, just briefly, my story growing up.
[03:39:58.957 --> 03:40:13.101]  Growing up, by the time I was 12, I had older friends, I was playing baseball with things in the neighborhood in Dallas, middle class area, Rockwall actually, there on the lake, and I'd go over and their older brothers would be smoking pot and I'd smoke it and wouldn't like the way it made me feel.
[03:40:13.101 --> 03:40:17.983]  So I was never really into drugs, but I saw it going on, and this was an affluent area,
[03:40:18.763 --> 03:40:25.692]  And so at the time I was about 14, I had friends who were now 18 who I knew were suddenly driving Corvettes and having a great time.
[03:40:25.692 --> 03:40:27.634]  They were being left alone by the police.
[03:40:27.634 --> 03:40:35.525]  I'd get pulled over with them in the passenger seat and they'd go, oh you can go, you know, because they knew them and I would be at a party
[03:40:35.945 --> 03:40:41.029]  And I'd see a plain clothes guy show up, and I knew these guys for so many years, they trusted me.
[03:40:41.029 --> 03:40:56.822]  Suddenly I was in the middle of this seeing ecstasy, cocaine, LSD, marijuana, with police delivering this to teenage and then 20 year old dealers who were running around selling this to all the yuppies and housewives in town.
[03:40:57.583 --> 03:40:59.905]  And again, by the time I was 14, I had a moped.
[03:40:59.905 --> 03:41:05.870]  I even had this one friend's older brother say, hey, just make marijuana deliveries for us right around the neighborhood.
[03:41:05.870 --> 03:41:07.271]  And I said, no, no, no.
[03:41:07.271 --> 03:41:15.858]  Then, by the time I'm 16, I'm in Rockwall High School, and the very cops I know are connected to drug dealing are in and around the school, being called into the school when there's drug busting things.
[03:41:15.858 --> 03:41:18.340]  And I started shooting my mouth off, going, you guys are dealing the drugs.
[03:41:18.340 --> 03:41:20.342]  You shouldn't be putting people in jail.
[03:41:20.342 --> 03:41:23.685]  And then my dad starts getting calls that we're going to hang your son in a jail cell.
[03:41:23.685 --> 03:41:24.746]  They did, and pulled me over.
[03:41:25.206 --> 03:41:28.067]  Threatened me in the car, said we're going to kill you if you don't shut up.
[03:41:28.067 --> 03:41:31.209]  And we had to move from Dallas to Austin.
[03:41:31.209 --> 03:41:33.750]  My dad said, that's it, we're out of here.
[03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:37.452]  Suddenly cops were by my house, driving around, they were pulling me over.
[03:41:37.452 --> 03:41:40.754]  They called me into the principal's office and said, we know you've stolen all the stereo equipment.
[03:41:41.254 --> 03:41:41.514]  I don't know.
[03:41:57.043 --> 03:41:58.164]  You made me take it back.
[03:41:58.164 --> 03:41:59.744]  I said, I haven't stolen any stereo equipment.
[03:41:59.744 --> 03:42:00.585]  I'm not a criminal.
[03:42:00.585 --> 03:42:06.688]  And he said, I know that, but we're going to put you in jail and big black men are going to rape you if you don't go set people up for us.
[03:42:06.688 --> 03:42:15.993]  So their way of trying to make me shut up as all this was happening was to try to call me in and say big black men were going to rape me if I didn't go set people up for stealing things.
[03:42:15.993 --> 03:42:20.975]  Then they called me in right before we moved and said, you know, we know you're involved in all these other criminal activities.
[03:42:20.975 --> 03:42:22.776]  We know you're involved in arson.
[03:42:22.776 --> 03:42:24.077]  And I was going, whoa.
[03:42:24.077 --> 03:42:26.118]  And then they found out we were moving.
[03:42:26.838 --> 03:42:35.586]  And it was the last day of school, and the cop walks out to my truck, you know, the head cop, and he says, Alex, I hear you're moving to Austin.
[03:42:35.586 --> 03:42:36.107]  Doesn't matter.
[03:42:36.107 --> 03:42:36.707]  You're a criminal.
[03:42:36.707 --> 03:42:39.169]  We're still going to get you, and black men are still going to rape you and give you AIDS.
[03:42:40.715 --> 03:42:45.298]  And you know, I've got some advice for any listeners and this is the advice we give daily.
[03:42:45.298 --> 03:42:51.623]  If you're in a jurisdiction and the cops are picking on you like they were Alex and many others, you need to leave that jurisdiction.
[03:42:51.623 --> 03:42:54.665]  You need to physically move away from that address.
[03:42:54.665 --> 03:43:03.891]  Candy and I fled East Texas to come to Austin because just eight months ago, one of them in a park, you were talking about how cops shoot people.
[03:43:03.891 --> 03:43:07.654]  Now they've got this neat thing they do and they did it to Candy and I and we're suing the department.
[03:43:07.854 --> 03:43:09.855]  I thought he was going to shoot him.
[03:43:31.207 --> 03:43:36.152]  It's on video and camera that he was in fear of his life, which is what the cops need before they pull the gun.
[03:43:36.152 --> 03:43:37.534]  They have to explain their fear of their life.
[03:43:37.534 --> 03:43:38.495]  In the threat continuum.
[03:43:38.495 --> 03:43:39.155]  Yes, yes.
[03:43:39.155 --> 03:43:43.400]  So he's already screaming, you're not going to shoot me, you're not going to shoot me.
[03:43:43.400 --> 03:43:47.163]  That way, if he had to shoot me on the video, it's like, man, I was scared.
[03:43:47.163 --> 03:43:48.405]  I thought he was going to shoot me.
[03:43:48.405 --> 03:43:50.827]  Because it was night and I had a cell phone, you know.
[03:43:50.827 --> 03:43:52.209]  That's what they're saying now.
[03:43:52.209 --> 03:43:52.529]  Oh, it's crazy.
[03:43:55.211 --> 03:43:56.192]  We thought he was going to do something.
[03:43:56.192 --> 03:43:56.992]  They put out a false story.
[03:43:56.992 --> 03:43:57.733]  It turns out he was on it.
[03:43:57.733 --> 03:43:58.973]  So we moved to Austin.
[03:43:58.973 --> 03:44:01.454]  It's safer here than other areas of Texas.
[03:44:01.454 --> 03:44:02.255]  I know the police chief.
[03:44:02.255 --> 03:44:04.176]  He's actually going to be in here in two weeks in the studio.
[03:44:04.176 --> 03:44:08.098]  Well, he's got a problem with taking blood from people.
[03:44:08.098 --> 03:44:08.978]  I brought that up to him.
[03:44:08.978 --> 03:44:10.259]  Yeah, he's got to quit that.
[03:44:10.259 --> 03:44:14.281]  But he at least is kicking cops off, which other departments won't, who are shooting people in the back.
[03:44:14.841 --> 03:44:16.242]  And they're saying they should be charged.
[03:44:16.242 --> 03:44:18.164]  Yeah, well that's his reasonable service.
[03:44:18.164 --> 03:44:21.126]  That's not like that Chief's doing a favor.
[03:44:21.126 --> 03:44:22.347]  I agree, I agree.
[03:44:22.347 --> 03:44:23.688]  But that's his reasonable service.
[03:44:23.688 --> 03:44:26.570]  He's supposed to kick cops off that shoot people.
[03:44:26.570 --> 03:44:36.117]  But holding people down like they've been doing through the holidays here in Austin with a search warrant to pull their blood from them is craziness.
[03:44:36.117 --> 03:44:37.678]  Oh no, I agree.
[03:44:37.678 --> 03:44:40.060]  And I saw the Chief on... Oh, I know, I didn't think that.
[03:44:40.620 --> 03:44:42.181]  But I do take issue with that.
[03:44:42.181 --> 03:44:46.722]  I saw him on the news the other day, proudly exclaiming and proclaiming, you know what?
[03:44:46.722 --> 03:44:54.725]  I hate that people drink and drive, but my freedoms are more valuable than the dangers even they bring.
[03:44:54.725 --> 03:44:55.286]  Absolutely.
[03:44:55.286 --> 03:44:59.387]  And those that claim, you know, give us your liberty for security, they always want to set up tyranny.
[03:44:59.387 --> 03:45:08.991]  And just finishing the story about Rockwall briefly, right before we moved, the sheriff, and I wouldn't have any trouble with them, it was the APD, or it was the Rockwall PD,
[03:45:10.154 --> 03:45:11.855]  It was the city.
[03:45:11.855 --> 03:45:16.018]  Got caught by the feds flying cocaine and marijuana into the Rockwall Municipal Airport.
[03:45:16.018 --> 03:45:21.521]  So it turned out it was a huge drug dealing operation to all those wealthy people in that bedroom community.
[03:45:21.521 --> 03:45:25.984]  And just because I shot my mouth off a few times, that concerned them.
[03:45:25.984 --> 03:45:27.045]  And they were getting ready to kill me.
[03:45:27.898 --> 03:45:36.381]  Because then my dad had one of the city lawyers who he'd known back from college days call him up and say, get your family out of here now.
[03:45:36.381 --> 03:45:37.222]  That's all I'm going to tell you.
[03:45:37.222 --> 03:45:41.783]  Get out of here now or your son's going to be hung in a cell when he'd already had that phone call.
[03:45:41.783 --> 03:45:50.687]  And then I had him pull me over, say you're drinking while driving, wasn't drinking, put me in the car, took me to the Rockwall jail cell when I was 16 and said,
[03:45:51.747 --> 03:45:53.629]  That they would kill me if I didn't shut up.
[03:45:53.629 --> 03:45:54.590]  Now that's American.
[03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.851]  That's scary.
[03:45:54.851 --> 03:45:57.153]  Well fortunately, yeah, fortunately you got away.
[03:45:57.153 --> 03:46:02.699]  Yolanda Madden and hundreds of thousands of others in this country didn't get away.
[03:46:02.699 --> 03:46:07.505]  And we're not going to stop until we see some prison doors come loose.
[03:46:07.505 --> 03:46:08.626]  Right.
[03:46:08.626 --> 03:46:10.708]  Well this is just an unbelievable interview.
[03:46:10.708 --> 03:46:11.770]  Tell us about the latest thing.
[03:46:13.586 --> 03:46:26.030]  We were planning to go to Washington State where I have proof and evidence that the cops there are raiding marijuana grow rooms using illegal FLIR cameras, the heat imaging cameras.
[03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:29.871]  So we were going to do that in Washington State.
[03:46:29.871 --> 03:46:38.674]  We had a group targeted and I got a phone call from a citizen in Odessa that told me my ex-partners had planted drugs on his daughter and wanted to know if I could help.
[03:46:38.674 --> 03:46:41.415]  So Candy and I switched operations and
[03:46:42.375 --> 03:46:44.397]  We rented a house in Odessa.
[03:46:44.397 --> 03:46:51.985]  We hired investigators to do surveillance and various other things that we needed before we set the trap.
[03:46:51.985 --> 03:47:00.213]  We rented a house in Odessa and we placed one grow light in the room with two Christmas trees and we started pumping the heat out of the wall.
[03:47:00.874 --> 03:47:02.734]  Now I never get rated in my second video.
[03:47:02.734 --> 03:47:07.896]  I have an entire chapter dedicated how to beat the FLIR cameras.
[03:47:07.896 --> 03:47:11.657]  And one of the tips there is do not pump the heat out of your wall.
[03:47:11.657 --> 03:47:14.998]  Because the cops drive by with these illegal FLIR cameras.
[03:47:14.998 --> 03:47:16.638]  They see the port, they see the heat.
[03:47:16.638 --> 03:47:17.478]  Yeah, they see the heat.
[03:47:17.478 --> 03:47:22.079]  And the Supreme Court has ruled those FLIR cameras are illegal to use unless you have a search warrant.
[03:47:22.079 --> 03:47:23.960]  They weren't illegal to use when I was a cop.
[03:47:24.580 --> 03:47:25.040]  Stay there.
[03:47:25.040 --> 03:47:25.481]  Stay there.
[03:47:25.481 --> 03:47:26.502]  Final segment.
[03:47:26.502 --> 03:47:29.524]  The full audience in 30 minutes in overdrive.
[03:47:29.524 --> 03:47:31.806]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:31.806 --> 03:47:33.647]  Powerful information.
[03:47:33.647 --> 03:47:46.318]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:47:46.778 --> 03:47:57.844]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:47:57.844 --> 03:48:01.246]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:48:01.246 --> 03:48:09.150]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:48:43.306 --> 03:48:45.447]  Are your kids safe when they go out?
[03:48:45.447 --> 03:48:49.448]  Everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack.
[03:48:49.448 --> 03:48:53.430]  You need DPS pepper spray from MrDefense.com.
[03:48:53.430 --> 03:48:58.592]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement

[03:49:33.075 --> 03:49:35.556]  Right now the world is a scary place.
[03:49:35.556 --> 03:49:41.000]  It's only a matter of time until we are struck again, but this time with biological and chemical attacks.
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:45.582]  The thought is scary, but it's important to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
[03:49:45.582 --> 03:49:48.284]  The First Line Defense Kit allows you to do just that.
[03:49:48.464 --> 03:49:58.476]  The first line of defense kit includes Nutri-Immune and Nutri-Defense, providing top biological host defenses against pathogen entry, and provides immune NK killer cell boosting.
[03:49:58.476 --> 03:50:07.266]  Also included, the Nano-Mask Nano-Particular Antiviral Masks with replacement filters, providing supreme viral protection from airborne pathogens.
[03:50:07.266 --> 03:50:08.888]  And, the first line of defense wipes,
[03:50:09.048 --> 03:50:09.348]  I think so.
[03:50:52.785 --> 03:50:54.366]  Alright, final segment for everybody.
[03:50:54.366 --> 03:50:59.588]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors, then we'll wrap up the live show, but continue in Overdrive Live.
[03:50:59.588 --> 03:51:10.293]  We're going to play this little six-minute clip from one of his films where he's challenging the corrupt police to not be corrupt, and then we'll talk more to Candy about some of the things she's witnessed and her whole view on this.
[03:51:10.293 --> 03:51:16.056]  I've got to have you guys back up for two, three hours in studio, because with me adding all my stuff, it just runs over here.
[03:51:17.156 --> 03:51:25.508]  Before we go back to them, two of the sponsors that made today's show possible are Acola Blue and My Solar Backup.
[03:51:25.508 --> 03:51:28.132]  Let me tell you about My Solar Backup first.
[03:51:28.132 --> 03:51:30.235]  This is the best unit for the price.
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:41.185]  That we have found anywhere and it's from our great sponsor Solutions from Science that have a lot of products up on InfoWars.com that we link to.
[03:51:41.185 --> 03:51:49.409]  And this is a great emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[03:51:49.409 --> 03:51:53.011]  It's just a great little unit, the solar panel, the power system that stores it.
[03:51:53.011 --> 03:51:54.532]  You can run a lot of things on this.
[03:51:54.532 --> 03:51:56.373]  You can order multiple units if you want even more power.
[03:51:56.873 --> 03:51:59.376]  One word, MySolarBackup.com.
[03:51:59.376 --> 03:52:03.640]  MySolarBackup.com or give them a call to get a brochure or to order at 877-327-0365.
[03:52:03.640 --> 03:52:03.740]  877-327-0365.
[03:52:03.740 --> 03:52:04.401]  MySolarBackup.com.
[03:52:04.401 --> 03:52:04.701]  A great unit!
[03:52:13.550 --> 03:52:24.875]  And in closing with our sponsors is Ecolablue that we have right here in the office, back there in the break room, in the office, grabbing more than seven gallons a day out of the atmosphere.
[03:52:24.875 --> 03:52:25.935]  There's water in the atmosphere.
[03:52:25.935 --> 03:52:27.996]  You can't see it except when it's clouds.
[03:52:27.996 --> 03:52:31.197]  And then it goes through five filters once it does that.
[03:52:31.197 --> 03:52:32.438]  So an amazing system.
[03:52:32.438 --> 03:52:33.558]  Ecolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[03:52:33.558 --> 03:52:33.638]  866-585-4044.
[03:52:33.638 --> 03:52:34.339]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[03:52:42.842 --> 03:52:44.603]  It's an atmospheric water generator.
[03:52:44.603 --> 03:52:50.047]  You see Willie Nelson pitching his own similar system, but this is really a fantastic system.
[03:52:50.047 --> 03:52:54.670]  Again, at coloblue.com or Big Banners, up on infowars.com.
[03:52:54.670 --> 03:52:57.652]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.
[03:52:57.652 --> 03:53:00.114]  And speaking of plugs, I want everybody to see these films.
[03:53:00.114 --> 03:53:12.422]  You know, I get so busy that I never get to ordering new products, getting them in the shopping cart at infowars.com with all the other books and films that I've written or films I've made or other books and films we carry, like Kevin Booth's American Drug War that I consulted on.
[03:53:14.023 --> 03:53:16.346]  These videos, I've seen one of them.
[03:53:16.346 --> 03:53:17.927]  Everybody needs to get these.
[03:53:17.927 --> 03:53:25.876]  We're going to be carrying these the next few weeks at InfoWars.com, but I want you to go to the website NeverGetBusted.com and get them today.
[03:53:25.876 --> 03:53:27.037]  Get both volumes.
[03:53:27.037 --> 03:53:28.879]  He gets death threats over these.
[03:53:29.239 --> 03:53:32.260]  This is key information that everybody needs to have.
[03:53:32.260 --> 03:53:34.841]  So again, we'll put it up on screen for the viewers as well.
[03:53:34.841 --> 03:53:37.602]  NeverGetBusted.com.
[03:53:37.602 --> 03:53:40.903]  And we'll play a clip from one of the films coming up in Overdrive.
[03:53:40.903 --> 03:53:44.504]  In closing, for the full radio audience that's out there in two minutes, other comments.
[03:53:47.014 --> 03:53:48.214]  Other points you'd like to make?
[03:53:48.214 --> 03:54:07.702]  I'd like to make the point that in this second video there's an entire chapter dedicated to Fleur and secretly one of the narcotics officers connected to the narcotics officers that we just busted in Odessa, he sold that footage to me out of his evidence room for a thousand dollars.
[03:54:07.702 --> 03:54:11.604]  I just released that information on the internet the day before yesterday.
[03:54:12.404 --> 03:54:22.573]  In the first film, Traffic Stops 1, the same narcotics officer filmed his dog false alerting and sold that to me for $1,000.
[03:54:22.573 --> 03:54:32.342]  He's the same officer, Richard Dixon, that you see in the newspaper articles that claim Barry Cooper made those films for money only.
[03:54:32.342 --> 03:54:34.724]  The whole time he was spending the $2,300 that I paid him for footage
[03:54:39.828 --> 03:54:45.810]  I want to talk more when we go into overdrive about how he didn't know he was selling this to you or he didn't know that you were setting him up.
[03:54:45.810 --> 03:54:52.291]  When we come back and a lot more for the MNFM audience, we'll be back tomorrow 11 to 3 Central Standard Time.
[03:54:52.291 --> 03:54:53.952]  Very thankful for all of you out there.
[03:54:53.952 --> 03:54:56.993]  Be sure to support those local affiliates and their local sponsors.
[03:54:56.993 --> 03:54:58.553]  For everybody else, you'll want to go one place.
[03:54:59.093 --> 03:55:04.538]  My left side to listen to the free audio streams or watch us at PrisonPlanet.TV if you're a member.
[03:55:04.538 --> 03:55:12.786]  Rebroadcast doesn't start now because we will continue to be live after this quick 70 second break right here on the GCN Radio Network and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[03:55:15.118 --> 03:55:16.720]  We just cut our feed.
[03:55:16.720 --> 03:55:19.283]  We just cut our feed connection with the GCN Network.
[03:55:19.283 --> 03:55:22.066]  We're only live now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:55:22.066 --> 03:55:23.267]  I want to flesh this out more.
[03:55:23.267 --> 03:55:24.468]  Now there won't be breaks for the next 30 minutes.
[03:55:24.468 --> 03:55:26.350]  We'll have plenty of time to talk.
[03:55:26.350 --> 03:55:30.735]  For the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and folks listening on the streams at InfoWars.com.
[03:55:30.735 --> 03:55:32.057]  Don't forget the free podcast, folks.
[03:55:32.057 --> 03:55:33.498]  Over 120,000 a day now.
[03:55:33.498 --> 03:55:34.199]  Subscribe to that.
[03:55:34.199 --> 03:55:35.741]  If you want to go subscribe, do that.
[03:55:35.741 --> 03:55:36.241]  We hope you will.
[03:55:37.142 --> 03:55:50.035]  Let's continue specifically with this latest thing you've been talking about in relation to how are you getting him to sell you videos, I guess this is before you exposed it, and then later he's claiming that it was just done for money.
[03:55:50.768 --> 03:55:51.689]  No, no, no.
[03:55:51.689 --> 03:55:53.810]  I might not have explained it well enough.
[03:55:53.810 --> 03:56:03.035]  Before Copbusters was ever invented and we were just doing never-get-busted films, I needed FLIR footage and I needed footage of a dog false alerting.
[03:56:03.035 --> 03:56:07.938]  So I called one of my ex-partners from the Permian Basin Drug Task Force.
[03:56:07.938 --> 03:56:12.161]  He's a Yoakum County's DA's narcotics investigator now.
[03:56:12.981 --> 03:56:18.663]  And I asked him if he had any of that for my films and he sold me that footage.
[03:56:18.663 --> 03:56:21.884]  I've kept it a secret this entire time.
[03:56:21.884 --> 03:56:29.686]  Now fast forward to four weeks ago when we set this dummy grow room and put Christmas trees under it instead of marijuana plants.
[03:56:30.326 --> 03:56:31.287]  We're good to go.
[03:56:45.034 --> 03:56:55.898]  Because on the search warrant affidavit, the only reasons they had listed for raid the cop buster's home, of course they didn't know it was a cop buster's home, was an anonymous letter and they made two drive-bys on the house.
[03:56:55.898 --> 03:56:59.200]  Well, that's not enough probable cause for a judge to sign the warrant.
[03:56:59.200 --> 03:57:00.980]  So he got busted as well.
[03:57:00.980 --> 03:57:03.782]  So I keep telling them, look, they're using these illegal flirt cameras.
[03:57:03.782 --> 03:57:04.882]  They didn't believe it.
[03:57:04.882 --> 03:57:07.123]  So I said, in three days, I'll announce the proof.
[03:57:07.603 --> 03:57:19.581]  Which was Monday, I announced the proof and I explained that I know they have a FLIR camera because one of your officers sold me the footage for my anti-drug war film.
[03:57:21.775 --> 03:57:28.059]  So they drove by our house and flirted illegally and didn't put that in the warrant.
[03:57:28.059 --> 03:57:38.846]  The judge signed the warrant and they kicked our door in and we had hidden cameras in there that said you're part of a reality show called Copbusters and all of us are unarmed.
[03:57:38.846 --> 03:57:40.608]  There's nothing illegal taking place.
[03:57:41.388 --> 03:57:45.289]  We'll be approaching within 10 minutes, all wearing red t-shirts.
[03:57:45.289 --> 03:57:46.629]  So you had a recording going?
[03:57:46.629 --> 03:57:47.930]  Oh yeah, hidden cameras.
[03:57:47.930 --> 03:57:49.090]  We played that video earlier.
[03:57:49.090 --> 03:57:50.270]  They were just totally freaked out.
[03:57:50.270 --> 03:57:53.051]  In fact, there's a video on YouTube of the entire raid.
[03:57:53.051 --> 03:57:58.052]  It's four minutes, and you can see the cops walking around the room trying to figure out what's going on.
[03:57:58.052 --> 03:57:59.333]  Tell you what, what's the name of that YouTube?
[03:57:59.333 --> 03:58:00.313]  We'll pull that up and play it to you later.
[03:58:00.313 --> 03:58:02.533]  Oh, just go to copbusters.com.
[03:58:02.533 --> 03:58:03.774]  Go to the second page.
[03:58:03.774 --> 03:58:04.974]  There it is right there.
[03:58:04.974 --> 03:58:05.974]  The second one.
[03:58:05.974 --> 03:58:06.374]  Second one.
[03:58:06.374 --> 03:58:06.714]  We'll play it.
[03:58:06.714 --> 03:58:07.735]  No, no, the third one.
[03:58:07.735 --> 03:58:08.295]  Third one, down here.
[03:58:08.795 --> 03:58:32.681]  Yeah, that's the entire raid and we proved their willingness to lie on an affidavit and we proved their willingness to do an illegal raid to expose these guys are crooked and we drew the bridge look this is the same group of guys that just planted the drugs on Yolanda and put her in prison for for eight years.
[03:58:32.681 --> 03:58:38.062]  So that was the big payoff of this thing was to bring national attention to the Yolanda Madden case.
[03:58:39.215 --> 03:58:44.639]  By the way, in 60 days we're going to sting another cop, so be ready for that.
[03:58:44.639 --> 03:58:46.441]  We're not going to stop.
[03:58:46.441 --> 03:58:54.387]  In fact, we could sting him today, but as well as you know, Alex, you know these things take time and timings.
[03:58:55.416 --> 03:58:57.797]  Important so we're gonna wait a little bit and get him.
[03:58:57.797 --> 03:59:18.447]  Oh a lot of work goes into this I mean, I want to go into courage and I talk a little bit to Candy about this I mean men are designed so are women to Be able to go out and confront bullies and and and just kind of shut off the fear and ignore it because you know It's for the greater good but but for a woman and again women have great courage, but just still myself
[03:59:19.207 --> 03:59:20.208]  Being death-threatened.
[03:59:20.208 --> 03:59:30.254]  Myself going and covering Bilderberg, an elite meeting, and people calling up and having fake women, you know, call up and say, I got them pregnant, or calling up and threatening our family and our children.
[03:59:30.254 --> 03:59:31.535]  My wife's a special person.
[03:59:31.535 --> 03:59:32.195]  She deals with it.
[03:59:32.195 --> 03:59:33.937]  She just says, I know we're fighting this evil.
[03:59:33.937 --> 03:59:35.538]  You know, she just laughs at them when they call.
[03:59:37.019 --> 03:59:44.588]  But they're always trying new tricks, or they'll call up and say there's some woman and say, Alex gave me a disease, or you know, just all sorts of nasty, dirty tricks.
[03:59:44.588 --> 03:59:47.311]  So I've lived some of what you've lived.
[03:59:47.311 --> 03:59:55.340]  More from both of you about the types of threats you get, any type of reprisals, and how you so cheerfully have this courage and go through this candy.
[03:59:56.345 --> 04:00:00.050]  Well, courage is contagious and Barry started the courage.
[04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:03.575]  So it's it's I don't know.
[04:00:03.575 --> 04:00:04.897]  It doesn't bother me.
[04:00:04.897 --> 04:00:06.019]  We're doing the right thing.
[04:00:06.019 --> 04:00:09.524]  I know we're doing the right thing and freedom, you know.
[04:00:10.386 --> 04:00:17.390]  That's a big deal and there's 1.5 million people in prison right now.
[04:00:17.390 --> 04:00:18.711]  It's really 4 million total.
[04:00:18.711 --> 04:00:22.813]  No, we're talking about 1.5 million children without parents.
[04:00:22.813 --> 04:00:24.734]  There's 2 million now actually.
[04:00:24.734 --> 04:00:28.296]  Which the state loves because then they get to CPS the children without due process.
[04:00:28.296 --> 04:00:29.997]  And then that messes them up.
[04:00:29.997 --> 04:00:30.798]  We have four kids.
[04:00:31.536 --> 04:00:34.098]  And so, I'm just fighting for them.
[04:00:34.098 --> 04:00:41.826]  Candy, we work with the same energy that it was one of our kids sitting in prison.
[04:00:41.826 --> 04:00:42.406]  Exactly.
[04:00:42.406 --> 04:00:46.931]  Because we're not really free if one of our... That's the total spirit of liberty.
[04:00:46.931 --> 04:00:48.012]  Exactly.
[04:00:48.012 --> 04:00:51.035]  When somebody does something to somebody else, I feel as if it's happening to me.
[04:00:51.035 --> 04:00:51.415]  Right.
[04:00:51.415 --> 04:00:53.297]  When I see those dead children in Gaza.
[04:00:53.957 --> 04:00:56.240]  That's exactly right, and that's what's happened in America.
[04:00:56.240 --> 04:00:56.941]  My father and grandfather
[04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:13.330]  We're good to go.
[04:01:37.486 --> 04:01:38.446]  And courage.
[04:01:38.446 --> 04:01:40.067]  Those are our weapons of warfare.
[04:01:40.067 --> 04:01:40.907]  We don't have guns.
[04:01:40.907 --> 04:01:42.307]  We can't shoot the police.
[04:01:42.307 --> 04:01:43.447]  We can't put them in jail.
[04:01:43.447 --> 04:01:45.228]  They have jails and guns.
[04:01:45.228 --> 04:01:46.148]  Well, there's another weapon.
[04:01:46.148 --> 04:01:47.048]  We have lawsuits.
[04:01:47.048 --> 04:01:48.648]  Get out and sue the police.
[04:01:48.648 --> 04:01:49.368]  Jam the courts.
[04:01:49.368 --> 04:01:49.949]  It only costs $350.
[04:01:49.949 --> 04:01:53.369]  There's YouTube clips of me explaining this.
[04:01:53.369 --> 04:01:54.930]  Costs $350.
[04:01:54.930 --> 04:01:57.990]  Walk down the federal courthouse and get a pro se packet.
[04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:59.851]  Takes an hour to fill it out and voila!
[04:01:59.851 --> 04:02:01.411]  The cops are sued in federal court.
[04:02:01.411 --> 04:02:02.651]  Candy and I have done it.
[04:02:02.651 --> 04:02:04.732]  We sued a judge and a police department.
[04:02:04.732 --> 04:02:05.092]  Cost us $350.
[04:02:06.912 --> 04:02:09.294]  And even if they beat the ref, they don't beat the ride.
[04:02:09.294 --> 04:02:09.794]  That's right.
[04:02:09.794 --> 04:02:13.037]  Listen, the Attorney General has to spend money getting them expunged.
[04:02:13.037 --> 04:02:14.238]  And list everybody.
[04:02:14.238 --> 04:02:15.178]  List the judges.
[04:02:15.178 --> 04:02:17.380]  List everybody on the lawsuit.
[04:02:17.380 --> 04:02:30.330]  And, you know, they'll get the judge recused from the lawsuit because they have immunity, but what it does do for you is it puts you in a position that judge can never sit in judgment against you again because you sued them so they have to get an outside visiting judge.
[04:02:30.330 --> 04:02:31.491]  There's strategy involved.
[04:02:32.151 --> 04:02:33.552]  It messes their whole system up.
[04:02:33.552 --> 04:02:34.393]  We like that.
[04:02:34.393 --> 04:02:40.257]  Or sometimes they don't recuse themselves and get more in trouble for violating the rules.
[04:02:40.257 --> 04:02:47.562]  You know, instead of myself just throwing out questions, other points, other important things you want to relay to people out there?
[04:02:47.562 --> 04:02:50.385]  Just have courage.
[04:02:50.385 --> 04:02:51.405]  Just have courage.
[04:02:51.405 --> 04:02:51.966]  Stand up.
[04:02:53.223 --> 04:02:55.585]  Yeah, keep fighting.
[04:02:55.585 --> 04:02:56.766]  Don't give up.
[04:02:56.766 --> 04:02:57.667]  Don't be afraid.
[04:02:57.667 --> 04:02:59.488]  Don't be scared.
[04:02:59.488 --> 04:03:00.569]  We'll help.
[04:03:00.569 --> 04:03:04.153]  Get on and do the cop busters.
[04:03:04.153 --> 04:03:05.694]  Report a cop.
[04:03:05.694 --> 04:03:06.775]  Stop suing cops.
[04:03:06.775 --> 04:03:07.415]  Do what you can.
[04:03:07.415 --> 04:03:10.038]  I'll tell you, I get afraid when I'm not fighting.
[04:03:10.038 --> 04:03:11.579]  I get upset when I'm not doing something.
[04:03:11.579 --> 04:03:15.723]  But when you're standing up, I don't have any fear.
[04:03:16.643 --> 04:03:17.443]  Is that what you're experiencing?
[04:03:17.443 --> 04:03:17.944]  Yes.
[04:03:17.944 --> 04:03:19.484]  Yeah, we're not afraid.
[04:03:19.484 --> 04:03:19.804]  No.
[04:03:19.804 --> 04:03:20.264]  We're not.
[04:03:20.264 --> 04:03:20.624]  Not at all.
[04:03:20.624 --> 04:03:23.665]  And that's the neat thing about courage.
[04:03:23.665 --> 04:03:26.706]  Courage will take the fear away if you start exercising it.
[04:03:26.706 --> 04:03:27.747]  It's like a muscle.
[04:03:27.747 --> 04:03:38.810]  But now, I'm not recommending for everybody to come out of the closet today and say, I smoke pot because you might lose your job, you might go to jail, but there are all kinds of cool ways you can help stand up and fight this war.
[04:03:38.810 --> 04:03:40.771]  I didn't have the courage I have now.
[04:03:40.771 --> 04:03:43.992]  I mean, it took a while from being with him especially.
[04:03:43.992 --> 04:03:44.952]  It took a while for me to
[04:03:45.572 --> 04:03:48.173]  Just stand up and go face the cops with them, you know.
[04:03:48.173 --> 04:03:51.635]  It took a lot of... now it's like habit.
[04:03:51.635 --> 04:03:56.017]  The more you do it, you know, the more you have, yeah, the more cards you have.
[04:03:56.017 --> 04:04:02.921]  Well, I mean, it's the arrogance and, you know, 6,000 plus people that are, you know, police officers against prohibition and growing.
[04:04:02.921 --> 04:04:06.542]  These judges, some of them high-powered, high-level, coming out and agreeing.
[04:04:06.542 --> 04:04:08.243]  More and more people standing up.
[04:04:08.243 --> 04:04:13.786]  I don't want to just indict all the police carte blanche, but when it is a corrupt, sickening system across the board,
[04:04:14.326 --> 04:04:21.409]  And they're so arrogant about it, and the one town I grew up in, they were dealing drugs and threatening teenagers to shut up.
[04:04:21.409 --> 04:04:25.890]  I mean, this is a great evil that's grown, and now it's being federalized with Homeland Security.
[04:04:25.890 --> 04:04:36.894]  Now, I mean, we have to say no now, because anytime you let national security run everything, anytime the people aren't involved, anytime you just say, oh, do whatever you want, you're going to get a tyranny.
[04:04:36.894 --> 04:04:39.295]  Well, you know, America, it is okay to talk
[04:04:41.656 --> 04:04:45.817]  Now, most of them are good.
[04:04:45.817 --> 04:04:47.578]  It's only a few that make them all look bad.
[04:04:47.578 --> 04:04:48.498]  That's not true.
[04:04:48.498 --> 04:04:49.238]  It's the system.
[04:04:49.238 --> 04:04:50.219]  It is the system.
[04:04:50.219 --> 04:04:52.660]  For one, they're dealing with a corrupt handbook.
[04:04:52.660 --> 04:04:55.161]  The penal code itself is corrupt.
[04:04:55.161 --> 04:05:07.205]  So if you have men that rally around a corrupt book, even though they might not plant drugs and they might not break policies, they are breaking constitutional law.
[04:05:07.705 --> 04:05:14.490]  And they are the enemy and they are corrupt because they picked up a book that they go by that's anti-American.
[04:05:38.706 --> 04:05:45.890]  It's certainly a process of corruption and as you mentioned earlier it's an us-against-them attitude.
[04:05:45.890 --> 04:05:53.434]  They're supposed to be a citizen's police force yet they show up to the scenes looking who they can arrest or shoot.
[04:05:54.815 --> 04:05:56.737]  There needs to be an entire paradigm shift.
[04:05:56.737 --> 04:05:57.657]  So it's predatory?
[04:05:57.657 --> 04:06:03.262]  Yeah, they need to show up to the scene wondering in their own minds, who can I help?
[04:06:03.262 --> 04:06:04.223]  Who can I protect?
[04:06:04.223 --> 04:06:04.663]  Justice?
[04:06:04.663 --> 04:06:05.704]  Who can I assist?
[04:06:05.704 --> 04:06:06.745]  Well, I mean, take firefighters.
[04:06:06.745 --> 04:06:11.249]  The firefighters on the DART platform, when the unarmed guy, they slam him down, shoot him in the back.
[04:06:12.250 --> 04:06:13.571]  They confiscate the videos.
[04:06:13.571 --> 04:06:18.578]  Before it's known that people shot videos that they didn't see out of another train, that it was stopped.
[04:06:18.578 --> 04:06:23.885]  They said all the videos malfunctioned, that were in the dark platform, and there were no other videos.
[04:06:23.885 --> 04:06:28.051]  Well, they had grabbed and taken two cell phones from people that did videotape it, but they didn't get all the cameras.
[04:06:28.491 --> 04:06:39.136]  So again, there's that total culture of we're all enemies, they're militarized, and they're all just freaking out when there's no enemy, and then they kill this guy, and then they go and try to cover it up.
[04:06:39.136 --> 04:06:41.177]  Just look at how they dress and how they look.
[04:06:41.177 --> 04:06:45.199]  They've kind of got that skinhead type look.
[04:06:45.199 --> 04:06:46.520]  They all look the same.
[04:06:46.520 --> 04:06:55.944]  And that's because it's only that genre or group of people that are willing to do what cops have to do now.
[04:06:55.944 --> 04:06:57.465]  Well, what happened to good cops that you saw?
[04:06:57.806 --> 04:07:00.364]  I mean, when people start saying no, what happens?
[04:07:02.731 --> 04:07:09.677]  Well, like what happened to me when I was doing my job and I arrested the mayor's son and I arrested the city councilman for marijuana.
[04:07:09.677 --> 04:07:15.742]  They start pushing you out when you get too close.
[04:07:15.742 --> 04:07:28.493]  It's hard for me to say there are good cops because if the citizens know about all the corruption, we know for sure the good cops, quote unquote good cops in the department, know about the corruption and they're turning a blind eye to it.
[04:07:29.133 --> 04:07:36.177]  When they're sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the American people, those good cops should be turning on all the bad cops.
[04:07:36.177 --> 04:07:37.338]  Where are the good cops?
[04:07:37.338 --> 04:07:42.541]  How come they're not emailing me saying, Barry, I'm glad you caught cops in an illegal raid.
[04:07:42.541 --> 04:07:44.101]  We need to do more of this.
[04:07:44.101 --> 04:07:48.864]  In fact, I've got a cop in my unit that does the same thing and I'll help you bust him.
[04:07:48.864 --> 04:07:51.886]  So see, it's hard for me to say there are good cops.
[04:07:52.526 --> 04:07:57.727]  If there are good cops, how come they're not taking a stance and helping us?
[04:07:57.727 --> 04:07:58.868]  Helping you?
[04:07:58.868 --> 04:08:01.728]  Helping the Americans get their freedoms back?
[04:08:01.728 --> 04:08:04.169]  They're not doing it because there are no good cops.
[04:08:04.169 --> 04:08:07.970]  They can say I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, but talk is cheap.
[04:08:07.970 --> 04:08:09.010]  Let's see it.
[04:08:09.010 --> 04:08:10.010]  I agree with you.
[04:08:10.010 --> 04:08:12.151]  When the system's corrupt and officers that don't
[04:08:13.934 --> 04:08:15.796]  Officially get involved in the corruption.
[04:08:15.796 --> 04:08:19.399]  They don't have their hands in it, but they stand by and turn a blind eye.
[04:08:19.399 --> 04:08:20.600]  They are now accessories.
[04:08:20.600 --> 04:08:21.380]  They're part of it.
[04:08:21.380 --> 04:08:27.245]  Just like if I see somebody being murdered and I turn a blind eye and I don't help, I'm in trouble.
[04:08:27.245 --> 04:08:30.028]  It's the same with the police officers in this land.
[04:08:30.028 --> 04:08:32.670]  I have zero respect for law enforcement.
[04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:35.232]  I want to have respect for law enforcement.
[04:08:35.232 --> 04:08:36.293]  We need law enforcement.
[04:08:36.713 --> 04:08:46.097]  There are animals in this land that want to hurt me and Candy and our children, so I have a lot of respect for cages to lock those kind of people up.
[04:08:46.097 --> 04:08:47.237]  A lot of those are the cops.
[04:08:47.237 --> 04:08:48.357]  Yeah, a lot of those are the cops.
[04:08:48.357 --> 04:08:49.458]  They want to hurt me.
[04:08:49.458 --> 04:09:02.963]  I don't have any respect for our criminal justice system in America, and we're going to continue dismantling it, doing whatever we can until the next tears that come to my eyes are going to be the tears of joys watching those prison doors shake open.
[04:09:03.183 --> 04:09:10.008]  Yes, absolutely, because they have to have a phony pretext to put people in prison for substances when it really is an illness.
[04:09:10.008 --> 04:09:11.789]  I mean, here I am drinking coffee.
[04:09:11.789 --> 04:09:16.392]  I quit smoking for a month, start back in, I'm out there smoking cigarettes during the breaks.
[04:09:16.392 --> 04:09:23.437]  The neuron receptors that coffee and cigarettes hit are the same ones that narcotics hit.
[04:09:23.437 --> 04:09:26.339]  So I'm literally using something that hits narcotic receptors.
[04:09:26.339 --> 04:09:28.520]  This is a narcotic amphetamine.
[04:09:28.520 --> 04:09:29.561]  I am drinking it right now.
[04:09:30.241 --> 04:09:35.887]  I can do two cups of coffee and it speeds me up more than one line of cocaine.
[04:09:35.887 --> 04:09:51.342]  That's my point is that it needs to be smoking isn't good, cocaine isn't good, cigarettes aren't good, and out of all these drugs that we know are bad, we know that it is marijuana that actually has all these health effects.
[04:09:51.923 --> 04:09:58.127]  You can get rid of 90% of the pills in your life and in America's life with that pot.
[04:09:58.127 --> 04:10:03.990]  You can stop the alcoholism, the people that are on the Prozac, the uptake inhibitors like you were talking about.
[04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:05.851]  They need a tripod?
[04:10:05.851 --> 04:10:13.676]  That's why Big Pharma has thousands of prescriptions now with THC, but they've noticed it isn't as good because it's not mixed with all the other little cofactors that are in there.
[04:10:13.676 --> 04:10:17.358]  I mean, marijuana really is a magic plant.
[04:10:18.299 --> 04:10:19.440]  It's a medicine.
[04:10:19.440 --> 04:10:24.145]  People all the time talk about it helps patients with glaucoma and cancer.
[04:10:24.145 --> 04:10:31.834]  My stomach was so bad I thought I was going to die because I had pancreatitis and Crohn's and if I hadn't had the pot...
[04:10:32.597 --> 04:10:35.999]  I don't think I would have made it because I was down to 90 pounds.
[04:10:35.999 --> 04:10:38.580]  Well, you know Crohn's is caused mainly by the vaccines.
[04:10:38.580 --> 04:10:43.142]  It didn't exist until the vaccines, and almost everybody, they've tested their intestines.
[04:10:43.142 --> 04:10:49.565]  It is a virus that was in a particular vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella that did that.
[04:10:49.565 --> 04:10:50.526]  I don't have it now.
[04:10:50.526 --> 04:10:54.228]  We have one of the autistic kids from that too, or five, six year olds.
[04:10:54.228 --> 04:10:55.188]  Oh my God.
[04:10:55.188 --> 04:10:56.969]  But people talk about like it helped her humming.
[04:10:56.969 --> 04:10:58.290]  See, see, you've been abused by it right there.
[04:10:58.290 --> 04:10:58.910]  It's everywhere.
[04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:59.210]  Right.
[04:10:59.210 --> 04:11:00.431]  She's been hit by the vaccines.
[04:11:01.471 --> 04:11:02.352]  Right.
[04:11:02.352 --> 04:11:10.678]  And what everybody's talking about how marijuana is such a good medicine for cancer patients and glaucoma.
[04:11:10.678 --> 04:11:14.381]  What about people like me that really works on themselves?
[04:11:14.381 --> 04:11:19.464]  I have all my life to be a better person and I can't calm myself down sometimes.
[04:11:20.385 --> 04:11:21.266]  And I smoke.
[04:11:21.266 --> 04:11:22.027]  It's great for ADD.
[04:11:22.027 --> 04:11:26.911]  Yeah, if I took Xanax and stuff like that, it has a bad side effect and I couldn't do that.
[04:11:26.911 --> 04:11:31.356]  But I smoke a little pot and it calms me down and I'm a nicer person.
[04:11:31.356 --> 04:11:38.102]  It should be prescribed to our criminals, the true criminals, that burglarize and rape and murder and harm.
[04:11:38.102 --> 04:11:40.485]  They're putting them in jail for peeing dirty for pot.
[04:11:40.485 --> 04:11:43.007]  They should prescribe it to them and give it to them in jail.
[04:11:43.007 --> 04:11:44.368]  I had cars stolen twice.
[04:11:45.484 --> 04:11:46.846]  Okay.
[04:11:46.846 --> 04:11:51.271]  Back in college, I had a girlfriend in Dallas, so I kept driving up there every weekend.
[04:11:51.271 --> 04:11:54.734]  Decent neighborhood, had the Mustang stolen twice.
[04:11:54.734 --> 04:11:59.520]  And I'd call the Dallas PD, and I'd say, okay, green Mustang stolen.
[04:11:59.520 --> 04:12:02.043]  And they'd say, oh, we don't even investigate car thefts anymore.
[04:12:03.107 --> 04:12:06.088]  And I said, okay, well you can't help me, and I hung up the phone.
[04:12:06.088 --> 04:12:11.571]  Bang, bang, bang, open the door, the cops bust in, guns drawn, but they weren't rude, but they violated my Fourth Amendment.
[04:12:11.571 --> 04:12:16.993]  Came into her apartment, went through the whole place looking for something illegal, and then said, you're not supposed to hang up on 911.
[04:12:16.993 --> 04:12:21.876]  I said, well, I can't, okay, you can't help me, bang.
[04:12:21.876 --> 04:12:23.737]  So, well, they actually gave me a number.
[04:12:23.737 --> 04:12:29.439]  They said later it may show up at this tow shop if it's been, you know, left on the road somewhere, which it did a few days later.
[04:12:29.439 --> 04:12:30.700]  And I said, okay, thanks for the number, boom.
[04:12:31.874 --> 04:12:33.354]  The cops show up.
[04:12:33.354 --> 04:12:35.915]  My point is, is that there's real criminals everywhere.
[04:12:35.915 --> 04:12:36.995]  There's real crime going on.
[04:12:36.995 --> 04:12:38.256]  The economy going down.
[04:12:38.256 --> 04:12:40.296]  There's rapes and burglaries and home invasions.
[04:12:40.296 --> 04:12:42.277]  I mean, speak to that.
[04:12:42.277 --> 04:12:43.477]  Absolutely.
[04:12:43.477 --> 04:12:46.057]  Well, it's exactly like you said.
[04:12:46.057 --> 04:13:00.401]  They're concentrating in arresting people that are non-violent and overlooking the violent offenders to the tune of, you know, people that molest children are being released out of prison to make room
[04:13:01.061 --> 04:13:01.221]  Yes.
[04:13:16.511 --> 04:13:18.231]  Never answer the door for the cops.
[04:13:18.231 --> 04:13:20.992]  Ever, ever, ever, ever don't answer the door.
[04:13:20.992 --> 04:13:25.033]  You go next to a window, open the curtain and say, I don't open the door for cops.
[04:13:25.033 --> 04:13:27.153]  If you have a search warrant, kick the door.
[04:13:27.153 --> 04:13:32.515]  Because if they're knocking on your door, that's telling you they don't have the probable cause to kick the door.
[04:13:32.515 --> 04:13:34.575]  And they want to talk to you to claim they smelled marijuana.
[04:13:34.575 --> 04:13:39.216]  They want the door open so they can claim they smelled marijuana and search your house.
[04:13:39.216 --> 04:13:40.216]  Don't open the door.
[04:13:40.216 --> 04:13:42.457]  Or claim that they believe that there may be a threat to them.
[04:13:42.457 --> 04:13:42.937]  Exactly.
[04:13:43.786 --> 04:13:44.447]  Yeah, exactly.
[04:13:44.447 --> 04:13:45.547]  They use that all the time.
[04:13:45.547 --> 04:13:47.309]  You know, I felt officer safe.
[04:13:47.309 --> 04:13:56.455]  Listen, in the academy, when I graduated the police academy, after 10 weeks, only 10 weeks, I was 21 years old, I was afraid of civilians.
[04:13:56.455 --> 04:14:02.119]  They made me believe every traffic stop I was going to be involved with, I could die on that traffic stop.
[04:14:02.119 --> 04:14:06.723]  So I was the guy who walked up real careful and scared, ready to shoot citizens.
[04:14:06.723 --> 04:14:07.763]  Because that's how
[04:14:08.644 --> 04:14:09.224]  We were trained.
[04:14:09.224 --> 04:14:14.367]  Meanwhile, statistically, more police get killed according to- Traffic accidents.
[04:14:14.367 --> 04:14:15.007]  Yeah.
[04:14:15.007 --> 04:14:15.388]  Yeah.
[04:14:15.388 --> 04:14:29.675]  Only 28 cops, according to the FBI, the Uniform Crime Reporting Act, only 28 cops have died in drug-related offenses in a 10-year period from 1996 to 2006.
[04:14:33.317 --> 04:14:36.618]  They make us believe cops are getting shot every day in this war on drugs.
[04:14:36.618 --> 04:14:45.540]  Only 2.8 cops per year are dying in this war on drugs, compared to the millions of Americans getting put in jail and getting shot.
[04:14:45.540 --> 04:14:50.121]  And whoever said the life of a cop was more valuable than the life of a citizen?
[04:14:50.121 --> 04:14:51.541]  It's supposed to be the other way around!
[04:14:51.541 --> 04:14:55.122]  And now they have huge official parades for a dead drug dog.
[04:14:56.442 --> 04:14:58.083]  And then it's like, remember down in Houston?
[04:14:58.083 --> 04:14:58.664]  I couldn't believe it.
[04:14:58.664 --> 04:14:59.004]  What about this?
[04:14:59.004 --> 04:15:01.265]  8,000 deaths on the contiguous 2,300 mile border with the United States and northern Mexico.
[04:15:01.265 --> 04:15:04.687]  8,000 deaths in 2008, and that was with a month running, so back in November.
[04:15:18.143 --> 04:15:20.104]  Who knows, it may be above 8,000.
[04:15:20.104 --> 04:15:25.708]  2,000 on the Texas-Mexico border alone, and then over 500 people killed just across the border with Texas.
[04:15:25.708 --> 04:15:29.050]  So we're talking, you know, just masses of dead people.
[04:15:29.967 --> 04:15:34.150]  Rocket attacks, car bombs, whole cities basically shut down on the Texas border.
[04:15:34.150 --> 04:15:36.231]  I've been down there, it's scary.
[04:15:36.231 --> 04:15:44.816]  And the drug gangs are completely taking over because they've made drugs illegal, it makes these huge profits in it, and so the criminals have a whole new theater to operate in.
[04:15:44.816 --> 04:15:48.839]  And let me tell you, the police are scared to death of those people and they're just leaving all that alone down there.
[04:15:48.839 --> 04:15:49.980]  And they're keeping that quiet.
[04:15:51.041 --> 04:15:55.427]  They're even killing federal officers every few weeks and shooting at people, but that's all kept quiet.
[04:15:55.427 --> 04:15:58.011]  Then they hype up some cop getting shot in Chicago.
[04:16:02.333 --> 04:16:24.810]  Arizona after they got that like three big three-ton marijuana bust last couple weeks and he was involved in the investigation when he announced the large bust he also announced that he's for legalization of marijuana because those drug cartels you're talking about fund their operations 80% of it through marijuana sales.
[04:16:26.229 --> 04:16:29.052]  Again, alcoholism tripled during Prohibition.
[04:16:29.052 --> 04:16:32.194]  It energized the mob, which grew over a thousand percent.
[04:16:32.194 --> 04:16:33.636]  That's the Fed Zone numbers.
[04:16:33.636 --> 04:16:35.477]  It corrupted police.
[04:16:35.477 --> 04:16:36.959]  It destroyed our society.
[04:16:36.959 --> 04:16:41.943]  And when they lost that, they brought in drug prohibition to keep that scam and business going.
[04:16:41.943 --> 04:16:47.948]  You know, I want to continue here and come back with some final comments from both of you, but instead of playing the video,
[04:16:49.406 --> 04:16:55.669]  Let's go to the six minute clip that you were talking about where you're challenging police.
[04:16:55.669 --> 04:16:57.570]  Which clip is that so they know which one to play?
[04:16:57.570 --> 04:16:58.750]  Plea to the police.
[04:16:58.750 --> 04:17:01.552]  Yeah, plea to the police on Never Get Raided.
[04:17:01.552 --> 04:17:09.995]  It's the volume two and you'll see in a minute I explain to the cops an alternative way of running a search warrant.
[04:17:09.995 --> 04:17:13.557]  Until we get the drug war repealed, I've got a foolproof plan in there.
[04:17:13.957 --> 04:17:14.478]  We're good to go.
[04:17:30.431 --> 04:17:36.236]  And surround the house with SWAT gear and terrorize families to search for the drugs.
[04:17:36.236 --> 04:17:39.218]  Well now they're also converting the giant drug war apparatus.
[04:17:39.218 --> 04:17:41.220]  They're keeping its funding the same or increasing it.
[04:17:41.220 --> 04:17:45.263]  But they're now dual training for political prisoners against the American people.
[04:17:45.263 --> 04:17:46.143]  Anti-terror.
[04:17:46.143 --> 04:17:51.427]  They're using the whole informant system now in Homeland Security to spy on people for their political views.
[04:17:51.427 --> 04:17:53.469]  The state police all over the country have been caught.
[04:17:53.469 --> 04:17:55.190]  I'm sure you've seen it in the press.
[04:17:55.190 --> 04:17:57.152]  Spying on groups that are against toll roads.
[04:17:57.572 --> 04:18:00.094]  Spying on groups that are against the war.
[04:18:00.094 --> 04:18:02.956]  Spying on groups that lobby for bike lanes.
[04:18:02.956 --> 04:18:08.720]  And they're putting in the files that they are terrorists for those views and using anti-terror laws.
[04:18:08.720 --> 04:18:10.541]  So now they've created the phony drug war.
[04:18:10.541 --> 04:18:14.083]  They're now expanding it into the terror war against the American people.
[04:18:14.083 --> 04:18:16.004]  And now they've announced 20,000 U.S.
[04:18:16.004 --> 04:18:20.167]  mainline army troops to be used at checkpoints for drunk drivers.
[04:18:20.167 --> 04:18:26.291]  And they've got Marines in California running checkpoints in multiple counties searching people's cars.
[04:18:26.291 --> 04:18:27.092]  That's now in the news.
[04:18:28.413 --> 04:18:29.334]  We've got to stop it now.
[04:18:29.334 --> 04:18:30.916]  People are leaving America.
[04:18:30.916 --> 04:18:35.020]  They're leaving this country because of that.
[04:18:35.020 --> 04:18:47.112]  In the next two years, if it continues like it's continuing, we're going to continue our fight in America, but we're going to do it from some other country.
[04:18:47.112 --> 04:18:47.933]  It's not safe.
[04:18:48.493 --> 04:18:49.635]  Here in America.
[04:19:06.139 --> 04:19:07.241]  No, I agree with him.
[04:19:07.241 --> 04:19:10.286]  My point is that they gloss it all over.
[04:19:10.286 --> 04:19:13.070]  They even gloss over them killing this guy.
[04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:14.653]  In California, they just gloss.
[04:19:14.653 --> 04:19:16.496]  They go, well, you can see he was scuffling.
[04:19:16.496 --> 04:19:17.878]  Slam him down, he's not moving.
[04:19:17.878 --> 04:19:19.761]  They kill him and the media goes, well, he was scuffling.
[04:19:20.438 --> 04:19:22.799]  I guess they needed to kill him.
[04:19:22.799 --> 04:19:27.960]  Again, the system does all this PR, selling us that it's okay, but they don't see the statistics.
[04:19:27.960 --> 04:19:32.881]  They grab over a million children with CPS a year in this country, and there's no due process.
[04:19:32.881 --> 04:19:47.666]  Briefly, before we go to this quote, when we come back from this clip, talk about what it was like when you would see the CPS coming and grabbing the children after you'd done a drug raid, and the horror in the children that you mentioned a little bit earlier, and then we'll probably end it with that and let you guys eat some of the pizza we just got out there.
[04:19:47.666 --> 04:19:48.586]  Let's go ahead and go to this
[04:19:50.009 --> 04:19:51.770]  When I was a police officer, SWAT teams were very rare.
[04:19:51.770 --> 04:19:53.871]  Now it seems every town has a little SWAT team.
[04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:40.000]  During the shooting of this film, we learned that three days ago in a small town in Ohio, a SWAT team raided a 25-year-old mother with six children.
[04:20:40.000 --> 04:20:46.024]  They used flash grenades and machine guns, shooting and killing the 25-year-old mother,
[04:20:48.021 --> 04:20:51.323]  Shooting the one-year-old baby in her arms.
[04:20:51.323 --> 04:20:57.826]  The one-year-old baby had to have a finger amputated and they're not sure what's going to happen to the arm.
[04:20:57.826 --> 04:21:08.331]  Does America need another drug case that bad that they have to shoot and kill a 25-year-old mother and a one-year-old baby?
[04:21:09.232 --> 04:21:15.580]  And what's even crazier is there is a non-violent way to conduct search warrants.
[04:21:15.580 --> 04:21:21.987]  Many cops have heard about the West Texas Sheriff that used to conduct raids in a non-violent manner.
[04:21:22.864 --> 04:21:31.886]  You remember how if he had a search warrant for a person's home, he simply did surveillance on the house until the residents drove away?
[04:21:31.886 --> 04:21:46.110]  And he pulled them over on a traffic stop, arrested them, got the keys to the house, interviewed the suspect, ultimately resulting in placing a key in a door and opening the house and calling the other people forward to arrest them?
[04:21:47.259 --> 04:21:49.619]  Without any shots being fired?
[04:21:49.619 --> 04:21:51.120]  Without any flash grenades?
[04:21:51.120 --> 04:21:52.700]  Without any of that stuff?
[04:21:52.700 --> 04:21:56.681]  Listen, I know what the police are doing.
[04:21:56.681 --> 04:22:05.943]  You're breaking into these homes in this manner, not because you have to, but because you have this huge adrenaline rush and you think it's cool.
[04:22:05.943 --> 04:22:09.823]  It's not cool terrorizing our American families.
[04:22:09.823 --> 04:22:12.724]  So please, until we get this drug war repealed,
[04:22:13.840 --> 04:22:30.685]  Change your way of breaking into our homes so we don't have to go to the funerals of 25-year-old mothers and we don't handicap a one-year-old baby the rest of his life.
[04:22:30.685 --> 04:22:32.966]  Barry and I have four wonderful kids.
[04:22:33.595 --> 04:22:36.796]  Who are straight-A students and popular wherever they go.
[04:22:36.796 --> 04:22:41.959]  The reason for this is because we teach our kids the truth about everything, including drugs.
[04:22:41.959 --> 04:22:44.360]  Candy's exactly right.
[04:22:44.360 --> 04:22:50.183]  Parents, stop trusting government programs such as D.A.R.E.
[04:22:50.183 --> 04:22:53.364]  to teach your kids the truth about drugs.
[04:22:53.364 --> 04:22:55.645]  They're not teaching the truth.
[04:22:55.645 --> 04:22:57.806]  They're teaching lies.
[04:22:57.806 --> 04:22:59.627]  Did you know in 5,000 years of recorded use,
[04:23:02.606 --> 04:23:06.567]  Not one person has ever overdosed on marijuana.
[04:23:06.567 --> 04:23:15.470]  You know it's sad our kids have to share books in our public school systems and struggle to get money to go to college.
[04:23:15.470 --> 04:23:23.572]  Yet we spend 17 million dollars a day housing our non-violent drug offenders.
[04:23:23.572 --> 04:23:31.274]  We built 21 prisons in the state of California last year and only one university.
[04:23:32.165 --> 04:23:34.947]  Parents, something is backwards.
[04:23:34.947 --> 04:23:36.669]  I want you to think about something.
[04:23:36.669 --> 04:23:43.414]  When was the last time you heard of a kid dying from an illegal drug in your neighborhood?
[04:23:43.414 --> 04:23:46.416]  It's very, very rare.
[04:23:46.416 --> 04:23:49.759]  It's not the drugs that are killing our kids.
[04:23:49.759 --> 04:23:51.780]  It's prohibition.
[04:23:51.780 --> 04:23:59.086]  Do you realize we have 1.5 million children without one or both parents
[04:23:59.733 --> 04:24:01.375]  Because of the drug war?
[04:24:01.375 --> 04:24:05.860]  That's right, their parents are setting out a non-violent drug crime.
[04:24:05.860 --> 04:24:07.402]  Now what causes more harm?
[04:24:07.402 --> 04:24:08.643]  The drug?
[04:24:08.643 --> 04:24:10.805]  Or the kids not being with their parents?
[04:24:10.805 --> 04:24:15.130]  And finally, we must be honest about our parenting skills.
[04:24:15.130 --> 04:24:16.612]  We've all made mistakes.
[04:24:17.273 --> 04:24:26.999]  There is absolutely no evidence that says when a kid uses drugs it causes them to go burglarize or commit another crime.
[04:24:26.999 --> 04:24:33.703]  The truth is selfishness and dishonor and disrespect are causing those things.
[04:24:33.703 --> 04:24:41.647]  It's easy for parents and teachers and doctors to blame our children's bad behavior on the drugs.
[04:24:41.647 --> 04:24:42.468]  The truth is
[04:24:43.374 --> 04:24:45.175]  It's bad parenting.
[04:24:45.175 --> 04:24:51.936]  We already have laws in place in this country to protect me and you and our kids.
[04:24:51.936 --> 04:24:57.998]  If a person commits a crime of violence, there's a law in place to put them in jail for that.
[04:24:57.998 --> 04:25:00.679]  We live in America, parents.
[04:25:00.679 --> 04:25:11.862]  And if people want to use drugs till their teeth fall out of their head, and develop this horrible quality of life because they wouldn't stop, they have the right to be miserable.
[04:25:12.637 --> 04:25:23.527]  Now, if they get up out of that drug-induced state and go and commit a crime, put them in jail for that crime, but not the drug.
[04:25:23.527 --> 04:25:25.229]  He's right, parents.
[04:25:25.229 --> 04:25:28.632]  Teach your kids the truth about drugs.
[04:25:28.632 --> 04:25:31.195]  Love, peace, and never get busted.
[04:25:40.233 --> 04:25:47.659]  There's a former cop put up a website that tells drug dealers and drug smugglers how to get away with their crimes, correct?
[04:25:47.659 --> 04:25:47.859]  Right.
[04:25:47.859 --> 04:25:51.082]  He's a former cop who is against the war on drugs, thinks it's a bad idea.
[04:25:51.082 --> 04:25:52.403]  But I mean, it's just vile.
[04:25:52.403 --> 04:25:54.785]  I mean, these people are just vile.
[04:25:54.785 --> 04:25:59.969]  It gets worse and worse.
[04:25:59.969 --> 04:26:05.654]  And sometimes body wires come in the form of a book.
[04:26:05.654 --> 04:26:06.554]  This one's 30% off, by the way.
[04:26:09.210 --> 04:26:10.771]  Alright, folks.
[04:26:10.771 --> 04:26:14.793]  This is our final segment in Overdrive with our guest.
[04:26:14.793 --> 04:26:16.674]  And, you know what?
[04:26:16.674 --> 04:26:25.158]  Barry, I've got to say, I've run into a lot of folks, I think you're one of the few people who I can actually get, since you live here in Austin now, to sit in on the show sometimes, guest host it when I'm out.
[04:26:25.158 --> 04:26:34.582]  And, you know, I haven't intended to do a TV network, other than my own show, that we're developing this for a dish network and cable in the next few months.
[04:26:34.582 --> 04:26:35.943]  But this is kind of the prototype in here.
[04:26:37.944 --> 04:26:49.128]  I just right now want to extend the opportunity in the next few weeks to get you to come in once a week or something and do a two or three hour once a week show just so you learn the ropes because I want to get you involved with the team.
[04:26:49.128 --> 04:26:49.988]  Hey, I'd be honored.
[04:26:49.988 --> 04:26:51.269]  You're a fascinating man.
[04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:54.250]  You've got a crew that's magnificent here.
[04:26:54.250 --> 04:26:55.090]  Candy and I are impressed.
[04:26:55.090 --> 04:26:58.292]  We've been in a lot of studios and we'd love to be a part of it.
[04:26:58.292 --> 04:26:58.992]  It's great.
[04:26:58.992 --> 04:27:01.693]  Well, we're just getting started and so this is very exciting.
[04:27:01.693 --> 04:27:03.914]  We'll definitely get something done on this.
[04:27:05.735 --> 04:27:08.018]  There are so many things I haven't gone over.
[04:27:08.018 --> 04:27:09.420]  So many things I know that you haven't gone over.
[04:27:09.420 --> 04:27:11.263]  We've covered a lot.
[04:27:11.263 --> 04:27:13.666]  But in closing, any other points you want to make?
[04:27:13.666 --> 04:27:15.468]  Things you think are important?
[04:27:15.468 --> 04:27:18.232]  And then the CPS issue.
[04:27:18.232 --> 04:27:20.034]  The tearing up families in the drug war.
[04:27:21.033 --> 04:27:23.014]  I can talk about that.
[04:27:23.014 --> 04:27:24.654]  It still makes me teary-eyed.
[04:27:24.654 --> 04:27:25.535]  I'm okay.
[04:27:25.535 --> 04:27:28.536]  I understand post-traumatic stress syndrome somewhat.
[04:27:28.536 --> 04:27:31.537]  It affects some people worse than others.
[04:27:31.537 --> 04:27:35.958]  I think I have a touch of that because it's been 13, 14 years and I still have nightmares from it.
[04:27:35.958 --> 04:27:36.919]  I'm okay.
[04:27:36.919 --> 04:27:38.179]  It hasn't harmed me.
[04:27:38.179 --> 04:27:42.301]  Well, they call it post-traumatic, but it's doing things that are immoral that affect you.
[04:27:42.301 --> 04:27:45.302]  But now the cure is doing things that are moral.
[04:27:45.302 --> 04:27:45.542]  Go ahead.
[04:27:45.542 --> 04:27:48.023]  It's the eyes of those kids looking at me.
[04:27:49.540 --> 04:27:50.521]  What's going on?
[04:27:50.521 --> 04:27:51.601]  Scared to death.
[04:27:51.601 --> 04:27:54.422]  They've been trained cops are good.
[04:27:54.422 --> 04:27:57.724]  Yet they see me taking the parents away.
[04:27:57.724 --> 04:28:00.786]  And we always had a lady there, you know, to deal with the kids.
[04:28:00.786 --> 04:28:02.486]  Would you plant drugs in those cases?
[04:28:02.486 --> 04:28:03.027]  Yes.
[04:28:03.027 --> 04:28:04.247]  Good God.
[04:28:04.247 --> 04:28:05.488]  How do they morally do that?
[04:28:07.386 --> 04:28:07.966]  No.
[04:28:07.966 --> 04:28:12.148]  So these CPS workers would then take the children and a lot of times they never went back to their parents.
[04:28:12.148 --> 04:28:12.588]  Right.
[04:28:12.588 --> 04:28:15.849]  To the tune of now Candy was, you know, got the new statistic.
[04:28:15.849 --> 04:28:23.011]  There's two million kids now without one or both parents because they're sitting out a drug crime in a cage.
[04:28:23.676 --> 04:28:25.698]  But he really thought he was doing the right thing.
[04:28:25.698 --> 04:28:27.099]  No, no, I understand.
[04:28:27.099 --> 04:28:36.486]  Listen, I don't ever judge people for bad things they've done if they wake up to it and then not just say I was wrong, but then go and fight against it.
[04:28:36.486 --> 04:28:37.126]  That's right.
[04:28:37.126 --> 04:28:47.594]  I mean, Saul of Tarsus went and hunted down Christians and killed them and tortured them and crucified them, and then he had this epiphany on the road to Damascus and became, you know, just an amazing person against evil.
[04:28:48.815 --> 04:28:53.837]  A lot of times the greatest soldiers against tyranny are those that have been in the belly of the beast.
[04:28:53.837 --> 04:28:55.458]  That's actually who we need.
[04:28:55.458 --> 04:29:01.960]  In fact, I want to put the call out to others out there watching who've been serving evil, who've been in denial, that have this horrible feeling in their heart and soul.
[04:29:01.960 --> 04:29:03.041]  You can get rid of that.
[04:29:03.041 --> 04:29:06.122]  It can stop when you stop the denial and really become a good person.
[04:29:07.230 --> 04:29:08.051]  Absolutely.
[04:29:08.051 --> 04:29:09.773]  It's never too late to change.
[04:29:09.773 --> 04:29:12.196]  They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
[04:29:12.196 --> 04:29:13.277]  That's a lie.
[04:29:13.277 --> 04:29:18.462]  You have a will and you can switch your mind and switch your actions overnight.
[04:29:18.462 --> 04:29:19.283]  I did.
[04:29:19.283 --> 04:29:27.092]  Once I realized and Candy started pointing these things out to me, you know, I switched and then I was lucky enough to have this opportunity to
[04:29:28.004 --> 04:29:31.187]  To be able to produce these films and then now do Copbusters.
[04:29:31.187 --> 04:29:36.031]  Not everybody has that opportunity, but everybody can change and do something.
[04:29:36.031 --> 04:29:38.854]  Everybody can do a YouTube channel.
[04:29:38.854 --> 04:29:40.676]  Good people have to become vocal.
[04:29:40.676 --> 04:29:44.479]  We have great tools, as you said, the internet and other things to do that, or starting a local radio show.
[04:29:44.479 --> 04:29:49.524]  I tell folks, if you have to go buy time, you know, 60, 70, 100 bucks an hour on some local station on the weekend,
[04:29:49.864 --> 04:29:51.847]  After a few months you'll have an audience that tunes in.
[04:29:51.847 --> 04:29:53.309]  You can get a few sponsors.
[04:29:53.309 --> 04:29:54.370]  Fund yourself that way.
[04:29:54.370 --> 04:29:56.253]  AXS TV was born here in Austin.
[04:29:56.253 --> 04:29:58.436]  That's how I started 13 years ago.
[04:29:58.436 --> 04:30:02.842]  But flesh that out just for a few more minutes and then we're going to plug the film and end this.
[04:30:02.842 --> 04:30:03.924]  Again, about the CPS.
[04:30:05.299 --> 04:30:06.240]  What was it like seeing this?
[04:30:27.688 --> 04:30:29.569]  That I saw that with.
[04:30:29.569 --> 04:30:31.010]  That I did that too.
[04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:33.511]  And, you know, I left their house.
[04:30:33.511 --> 04:30:38.093]  But, you know, they're in their teenage years right now, but that didn't go away.
[04:30:38.093 --> 04:30:39.054]  It's terrorizing.
[04:30:39.054 --> 04:30:41.995]  I mean, I'm a big old guy, and I was scary then.
[04:30:41.995 --> 04:30:43.656]  And so were the people I worked with.
[04:30:43.656 --> 04:30:47.137]  And it was scary to watch us come crashing through your door.
[04:30:47.137 --> 04:30:52.160]  I remember watching men pee on themselves, grown men, the fathers, in sheer terror, just
[04:30:53.246 --> 04:31:00.313]  And we thought it was funny, you know, the videographer that was with us filming the raids for legal purposes.
[04:31:00.313 --> 04:31:06.520]  We would go back to the office and laugh about how scared they were.
[04:31:06.520 --> 04:31:15.689]  You've seen the footage of them strip searching some woman who called the police and she's screaming, crying as they're pulling her panties off and the cops are laughing.
[04:31:15.689 --> 04:31:16.210]  They're sick.
[04:31:17.657 --> 04:31:19.862]  We have sick men in law enforcement.
[04:31:19.862 --> 04:31:28.059]  That's the thing about evil, is that it starts slow, but once you commit and make a joke about it, it just gets worse and worse, and you go right off a cliff.
[04:31:28.059 --> 04:31:28.480]  That's right.
[04:31:30.997 --> 04:31:35.440]  Well, this has been one of the most amazing interviews, and I don't say this with most guests.
[04:31:35.440 --> 04:31:39.243]  This has been an amazing interview, and Candy, I am so impressed.
[04:31:39.243 --> 04:31:42.345]  I am so impressed with everything you guys are doing.
[04:31:42.345 --> 04:31:49.450]  I am so impressed with Never Get Busted Again, NeverGetBusted.com, and everything you're doing, Barry Cooper.
[04:31:49.450 --> 04:31:56.015]  It's just unbelievable, and get ready with some outro music, guys, because we're going to end this here in just a few minutes.
[04:31:56.015 --> 04:31:57.477]  I do want to encourage everybody.
[04:31:58.217 --> 04:32:00.238]  To go to www.nevergetbusted.com
[04:32:20.425 --> 04:32:28.093]  Get them on, and it was the perfect time when you were already in Austin, so maybe fate had it that I didn't do it from a distance so I could really be here with you in person.
[04:32:28.093 --> 04:32:34.439]  And as George Bush said about Putin, look into your eyes and see your soul, but you've got a good soul, not one like Mr. Putin.
[04:32:34.439 --> 04:32:38.162]  And you too, Candy, so this has just been just amazing.
[04:32:38.162 --> 04:32:39.484]  Us too, for us too.
[04:32:39.484 --> 04:32:41.486]  We love being here with you.
[04:32:41.486 --> 04:32:43.047]  Alright, well we're going to end this transmission.
[04:32:43.047 --> 04:32:43.788]  Anything else you want to add?
[04:32:44.813 --> 04:32:49.556]  Just peace, love, and never get busted.
[04:32:49.556 --> 04:32:58.541]  If you're going to travel with pot, never carry more than you can eat and go in the rain to avoid a cage.
[04:32:58.541 --> 04:32:59.242]  Absolutely.
[04:32:59.242 --> 04:33:01.303]  Alright, well that's it ladies and gentlemen.
[04:33:01.303 --> 04:33:12.970]  In closing, I hope you'll visit InfoWars.com, the secure online shopping cart to get films like Fabled Enemies, The Money Masters about what the bankers are doing, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[04:33:14.373 --> 04:33:21.759]  9-11 Chronicles, Truth Rising and others ladies and gentlemen and that's how you financially support us so we can do the work we're doing.
[04:33:21.759 --> 04:33:26.482]  I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members who watch us live who also fund our operation.
[04:33:26.482 --> 04:33:27.083]  I love you all.
[04:33:27.083 --> 04:33:27.663]  God bless you.
[04:33:27.663 --> 04:33:30.165]  Now get out there and take on tyranny today.
[04:33:30.165 --> 04:33:31.306]  We'll see you back live tomorrow.
[04:33:31.306 --> 04:33:31.706]  Take care.
[04:33:31.706 --> 04:33:35.970]  We now join the retransmission of the show from earlier today at InfoWars.com.
[04:33:45.916 --> 04:33:47.521]  Stand up for your right!
