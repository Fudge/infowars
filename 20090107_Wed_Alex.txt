[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:38.480]  Texas Alex Jones hello my friends hello and thank you for joining us already
[00:38.480 --> 00:47.000]  Wednesday the 7th day of January 2009 we're gonna be live here for the next
[00:47.000 --> 00:55.600]  four hours and coming up we've got Eric Plumley attorney on cell phone
[00:55.600 --> 01:03.320]  surveillance in the United States and worldwide how they're listening to you
[01:03.320 --> 01:06.640]  how they're tracking you how it's designed even when the phone is turned
[01:06.640 --> 01:10.920]  off that they listen to you by law the phone is designed to not just track your
[01:10.920 --> 01:16.840]  location but audibly listen to you I told you this back in 1996 now the
[01:16.840 --> 01:22.360]  public is basically becoming aware of it so we'll go ahead and cover it also Ray
[01:22.360 --> 01:29.080]  McGovern former top CIA analyst to George Bush senior and of course Ronald
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.400]  Reagan getting into the Gaza situation and his analysis of what's coming up in
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.560]  the next year from his perspective he was the morning briefer again to two
[01:38.560 --> 01:45.120]  presidents and then we've got Barry Cooper never get busted calm cop busters
[01:45.120 --> 01:50.240]  he's part of the organization of former narcotics officers that are against
[01:50.240 --> 01:54.800]  drug prohibition and expose the fact that it gets cops killed citizens
[01:54.800 --> 01:59.080]  enslaved and only increases the amount of drugs on our streets and he's been
[01:59.080 --> 02:05.320]  busting cops trying to set people up so that is certainly exciting because
[02:05.320 --> 02:08.520]  there are tens of thousands of officers that are members of this group and
[02:08.520 --> 02:12.080]  several other groups and they are aggressively well they just caught a
[02:12.080 --> 02:16.520]  bunch of police in Florida not allowing people to file complaints on police and
[02:16.520 --> 02:22.920]  the police will start shoving on you hitting on you this guy's a retired
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.040]  police officer they threw him through a plate glass window at the police station
[02:27.040 --> 02:30.640]  for just saying look you need to give me the complaint form and the complaint
[02:30.640 --> 02:34.280]  form itself goes in trash can later but they won't even give you that much
[02:34.280 --> 02:37.600]  respect to give you the thing they throw in the trash can they just throw it to
[02:37.600 --> 02:41.920]  the plate glass window but there are a lot of police who aren't evil and aren't
[02:41.920 --> 02:45.400]  arrogant aren't thugs and they're leaving the force and investigating and
[02:45.400 --> 02:50.840]  tracking police and winning a lot of big lawsuits as well so I certainly love
[02:50.840 --> 02:55.760]  that they the establishment ships and drugs sells them to us then goes out
[02:55.760 --> 02:59.280]  and bust people that use them to fund their criminal operation if the
[02:59.280 --> 03:02.840]  patriots can fund our operations by suing these criminals and bringing them
[03:02.840 --> 03:10.120]  to justice all the more pleasing and if you're not a bad cop and you're not
[03:10.120 --> 03:13.680]  violating the Bellarites Constitution I'm gonna worry about do you you're not
[03:13.680 --> 03:17.520]  breaking the law and nothing nothing to worry about do you that's right you
[03:17.520 --> 03:23.800]  don't and that brings me to San Francisco I'm gonna get into this later in
[03:23.800 --> 03:28.760]  the broadcast once we go live at prisonplanet.tv because I want to show
[03:28.760 --> 03:37.720]  the clips the witnesses were all saying that they took the black men off the
[03:37.720 --> 03:41.960]  train there had been a report of people yelling and screaming at each other and
[03:41.960 --> 03:49.360]  arguing on the train and that they then were putting them in handcuffs and that
[03:49.360 --> 03:54.840]  the man wasn't resisting that they shot him in the back and the police and we
[03:54.840 --> 04:00.280]  have their first press conferences said no that's not true and then they use
[04:00.280 --> 04:10.600]  this weird lawyer speak to say there was a altercation an argument and then the
[04:10.600 --> 04:15.760]  officers one of the officers shot him now would legally speak he's talking
[04:15.760 --> 04:23.000]  about the argument on the train between the men that had the police respond but
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.560]  psychologically and they do this on the news to the newscast later they're
[04:27.560 --> 04:32.640]  sandwiching that in with oh he did something in an altercation with police
[04:32.640 --> 04:39.480]  and they lie well they also confiscated surveillance not surveillance tapes tapes
[04:39.480 --> 04:44.480]  that citizens shot but that didn't stop people on another train that was stopped
[04:44.480 --> 04:49.760]  videoing it and so the videos have been released showing the police live and
[04:49.760 --> 04:55.320]  that's the issue and folks he just executes this guy the guy is not
[04:55.320 --> 04:59.480]  resisting nothing they're beating him up for fun and they just got into such a
[04:59.480 --> 05:03.560]  frenzy they just kill him hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a
[05:03.560 --> 05:06.680]  long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[05:06.680 --> 05:10.120]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the
[05:10.120 --> 05:13.720]  key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.240]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[05:17.240 --> 05:21.200]  in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a
[05:21.200 --> 05:24.680]  good old boy bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams
[05:24.680 --> 05:28.200]  not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print
[05:28.200 --> 05:33.080]  $850 billion at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[05:33.080 --> 05:37.240]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[05:37.240 --> 05:41.200]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of the citizens particularly food
[05:41.200 --> 05:45.920]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[05:45.920 --> 05:49.880]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[05:49.880 --> 05:54.160]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[05:54.160 --> 05:58.000]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.600]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.600 --> 06:05.760]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:05.760 --> 06:09.800]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[06:09.800 --> 06:13.480]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[06:13.480 --> 06:17.640]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[06:17.640 --> 06:20.560]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a
[06:20.560 --> 06:24.120]  supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control
[06:24.120 --> 06:28.680]  over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no
[06:28.680 --> 06:32.080]  one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you you know

[07:35.200 --> 07:39.080]  bathroom of the office of the secretary of the interior who apparently likes to
[07:39.080 --> 07:44.920]  freeze stuff in there number two what's but gait John Bolton and John you two of
[07:44.920 --> 07:48.440]  the architects of mr. Bush's foreign policy of shoot first ask question
[07:48.440 --> 07:52.120]  second mention it to Congress last they have written an op-ed for the New York
[07:52.120 --> 07:57.080]  Times title restore the Senate's treaty power they are arguing that now the
[07:57.080 --> 08:00.280]  Senate needs to reassert its right to slam the brakes on unilateral
[08:00.280 --> 08:04.280]  international actions by the president their concern that Obama that may go
[08:04.280 --> 08:09.040]  Obama may go for a Kyoko style climate accord without Senate ratification
[08:09.040 --> 08:12.240]  bombing the hell out of the closest thing to an innocent bystander nation
[08:12.240 --> 08:16.040]  and getting 4,000 more troops killed without Senate consent that's fine try
[08:16.040 --> 08:19.760]  to save the atmosphere and suddenly John freakin Bolton is demanding checks and
[08:19.760 --> 08:23.800]  balances to mr. You and to mr. Bolton this question do you take your
[08:23.800 --> 08:29.240]  hypocrisy orally or intravenously and number one crazy vice president gait
[08:29.240 --> 08:33.760]  we continue to race the clock well mr. Cheney somehow managed to destroy the
[08:33.760 --> 08:37.760]  planet in the next two weeks on face the nation he not only insisted that the
[08:37.760 --> 08:41.200]  economic collapse consisted of quote difficulties that have developed in the
[08:41.200 --> 08:46.320]  financial markets over the last six months but when asked by Bob Schieffer if
[08:46.320 --> 08:51.240]  we're better off than we were eight years ago he replied I think we've done
[08:51.240 --> 08:55.640]  some very good things over the course of the last eight years defending the
[08:55.640 --> 08:58.920]  country against further terrorist attacks like 9-11 I think the major
[08:58.920 --> 09:04.680]  accomplishment for example gets worse our task when we came in was ultimately
[09:04.680 --> 09:08.960]  to deal with the aftermath of 9-11 and we had to take on the global war on
[09:08.960 --> 09:13.960]  terror listen you fatuous condescending lunatic for the last time your task was
[09:13.960 --> 09:17.920]  not to deal with the aftermath of 9-11 it was to prevent 9-11 and if you
[09:17.920 --> 09:21.560]  utterly whiffed on the most important test of all the presidencies in your
[09:21.560 --> 09:26.800]  lifetime mr. Cheney you do not get credit for getting a C on the pop quizzes
[09:26.800 --> 09:29.400]  that followed
[09:29.400 --> 09:46.400]  a new world order a new world order
[09:46.400 --> 10:02.320]  out of these trouble times our fifth objective a new world order
[10:02.320 --> 10:20.320]  all right folks thank you for joining us today it is Wednesday the seventh of
[10:20.320 --> 10:43.120]  January 2009 I spin about an hour and a half late last night of time I didn't
[10:43.120 --> 10:53.480]  have to really investigate this shooting that took place by the transit
[10:53.480 --> 11:02.640]  train police the subway police out in California you know this happened last
[11:02.640 --> 11:06.680]  Friday I didn't comment on it Sunday I didn't comment on it Tuesday because I
[11:06.680 --> 11:11.320]  hadn't had time to go research it and look at it and I don't just sit here
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.920]  waiting feverishly to go after the police and bash the culture and bash
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.480]  their training I have to people are saying why aren't you commenting on this
[11:20.480 --> 11:28.000]  why aren't you discussing this well the videos hadn't leaked out yet and every
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.440]  few days I see a report we've had a few here in Austin where the police shoot
[11:31.440 --> 11:39.160]  someone in the back someone in handcuffs or someone restrained and I don't even
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.160]  particularly at nausea and bash the police for that because I have to go
[11:44.160 --> 11:47.800]  study each case and spend time on it before I'm gonna say anything about it
[11:47.800 --> 11:53.160]  well I did spend a lot of time hour and a half I went back and read all the
[11:53.160 --> 11:57.720]  original articles put out Friday Saturday Sunday Monday I went and watched the
[11:57.720 --> 12:03.400]  different press conferences by the police and then now how do I put on the
[12:03.400 --> 12:11.020]  case here on air how do I go over all the evidence how do I cover all the
[12:11.020 --> 12:16.040]  different facets I mean number one the police lied and said he wasn't restrained
[12:16.040 --> 12:20.280]  they lied and implied that he was scuffling with them or arguing with them
[12:20.280 --> 12:26.560]  there was a confrontation they seized two video recordings that were shot on
[12:26.560 --> 12:30.520]  cell phones by people on the platform that they saw they told everybody stay
[12:30.520 --> 12:34.000]  here pulled their guns out on them and confiscated their video and then the
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.560]  police said we don't know our video cameras weren't recording the video
[12:38.560 --> 12:42.520]  camera surveillance system in that particular train stop just happened to
[12:42.520 --> 12:47.680]  not be recording that day then they said oh that system wasn't recording period
[12:47.680 --> 12:52.200]  it wasn't hooked up to a recording system like all the other bus stops but
[12:52.200 --> 12:55.640]  there was no discussion of the fact that they'd seized the two videos shot by
[12:55.640 --> 13:01.040]  people on cell phones well guess what happened another train was pulling up
[13:01.040 --> 13:06.760]  and stopping as the police roughing up the young black men and some people said
[13:06.760 --> 13:13.880]  oh we got the police roughing folks up let's go ahead and videotape that and
[13:13.880 --> 13:18.560]  so they got their cameras rolling they got their cell phones rolling and then
[13:18.560 --> 13:24.280]  it took a few days for people to contact the media but those videos are now out
[13:24.280 --> 13:30.960]  started coming out what Monday night I didn't see them till yesterday and sure
[13:30.960 --> 13:37.520]  enough it's not even the issue that they murder this guy it's that they make
[13:37.520 --> 13:41.400]  excuses now the videos have come out and are saying well he thought it was his
[13:41.400 --> 13:47.640]  taser it was taser confusion may have been the issue here though is that they
[13:47.640 --> 13:56.280]  lied the police officials with the transit authority lied about it and
[13:56.280 --> 14:02.680]  they need to go to jail I'm not even so much focused on the police officer
[14:02.680 --> 14:10.280]  clearly in a frenzy who pulls his gun out aims at the man's back and kills him
[14:10.280 --> 14:15.600]  because you can see the police officer's response where he drops the drops his
[14:15.600 --> 14:19.480]  hand with the gun and starts cussing going what the hell what the hell just
[14:19.480 --> 14:26.000]  happened I believe he probably did think it was his taser and I'm trying to be
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.920]  fair here I don't because I quote hate cops just then go no he clearly killed
[14:30.920 --> 14:37.400]  him in cold blood and meant to do it that could be the case we don't know but
[14:37.400 --> 14:41.720]  the way he reacted after he killed the guy after he shot the poor man who did
[14:41.720 --> 14:46.600]  nothing wrong looks like he was shocked doesn't matter you still need to go to
[14:46.600 --> 14:53.960]  jail for manslaughter need to spend a few years in prison you killed somebody
[14:53.960 --> 15:01.840]  their life is over they did nothing wrong but I'm already digressing
[15:01.840 --> 15:12.360]  coming up later when we go live at prison planet dot TV at one o'clock central
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.440]  in an hour and 45 minutes I'm gonna open up that first 30 minutes before Ray
[15:16.440 --> 15:23.520]  McGovern joins us to cover what's happening in Gaza and we're gonna play
[15:23.520 --> 15:26.680]  some of these videos for the prison planet TV viewers I'll describe them for
[15:26.680 --> 15:30.360]  the radio audience they're all linked up on info wars dot com prison planet dot
[15:30.360 --> 15:37.280]  com and we'll break this down but the issue is studying police agencies they
[15:37.280 --> 15:41.760]  lie more often than they tell the truth in fact sometimes even the truth suits
[15:41.760 --> 15:49.480]  them they lie it is a culture of lying and deceit and I'm tired of it I saw
[15:49.480 --> 15:55.520]  this culture a year and a half ago when we were out when the governor had
[15:55.520 --> 16:00.560]  illegally gone to the Bilderberg conference in violation the Logan Act
[16:00.560 --> 16:07.760]  Rick Perry governor of Texas he gone to Istanbul Turkey and we went out we were
[16:07.760 --> 16:11.800]  protesting him in a function he was at about 150 of us peacefully on the sidewalk
[16:11.800 --> 16:16.840]  not blocking any roads and the Austin commander comes over the first commander
[16:16.840 --> 16:20.880]  that showed up they had riot police and you know massing across the street down
[16:20.880 --> 16:24.440]  the street in a parking lot and he said listen if you don't leave in five
[16:24.440 --> 16:29.880]  minutes I'm going to have you arrested and this is on camera we have a camera
[16:29.880 --> 16:33.320]  right there he really comes up and tries to whisper it and I say you're gonna
[16:33.320 --> 16:37.840]  arrest me he goes yes I kind of bucked up a little bit just to get him to talk
[16:37.840 --> 16:41.760]  louder I knew the camera was about five feet away and he says yes and I said
[16:41.760 --> 16:46.680]  hmm then there was a local magazine reporter there and I went over and said
[16:46.680 --> 16:50.240]  he just threatened to arrest us if we don't leave and the reporter goes all
[16:50.240 --> 16:55.000]  that's not true Alex that come on and he goes over to the cop and goes did you
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.640]  just threaten to arrest everybody if we don't leave and he goes no I didn't
[16:57.640 --> 17:03.480]  Alex is lying well then I really did blow up and then another commander his
[17:03.480 --> 17:07.240]  boss shows up and comes over and tells me you know what are you doing here you
[17:07.240 --> 17:11.040]  need to go and I said look he just lied and said he didn't say he was gonna have
[17:11.040 --> 17:14.200]  us all arrested the Austin police department's already lost a bunch of
[17:14.200 --> 17:17.560]  lawsuits over this I have a First Amendment right I don't have to have a
[17:17.560 --> 17:24.840]  permit to be here I'm not blocking roads and I said go ahead but I'm going to sue
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.120]  the commanders that give these orders and you can beat the rat but you can't
[17:29.120 --> 17:35.640]  beat the ride and they got so mad and backed off why why did you get mad I'm

[18:23.800 --> 18:27.920]  lost lawsuits in Dallas for coming up the first big cases were what back in
[18:27.920 --> 18:33.280]  2000 they lost because if you tried to even hand out pamphlets or even shout

[25:34.040 --> 25:45.680]  all right I was listening to Derry brownfield is on the Genesis Network
[25:45.680 --> 25:51.720]  right before the show and I heard a caller call in and tell Derry who's a
[25:51.720 --> 25:55.560]  great guy syndicated all across the country that the trans texas corridor
[25:55.560 --> 26:00.680]  is not dead because Derry been reporting that and why wouldn't he that's what the
[26:00.680 --> 26:06.080]  Associated Press the Dallas Morning News all the major TV stations in Texas are
[26:06.080 --> 26:10.680]  reporting but if you go to the press release put out by text dot they state
[26:10.680 --> 26:16.760]  on record that they are simply not going to call it the trans texas corridor
[26:16.760 --> 26:21.240]  anymore that they are going to give it a new name and that they are going to not
[26:21.240 --> 26:27.240]  cancel one part of it one section of 8,000 miles of Texas roads being seized
[26:27.240 --> 26:33.160]  and handed over to foreign companies to put toll roads on them now that's the
[26:33.160 --> 26:38.800]  text dot trans texas corridor part of a larger NAFTA super highway system in the
[26:38.800 --> 26:42.080]  official federal documents it's all in my film in game blueprint for global
[26:42.080 --> 26:47.320]  enslavement the text dot hearings the documents the state and the feds own
[26:47.320 --> 26:55.080]  records and they want to take 34 major US interstate highways and make those
[26:55.080 --> 26:59.200]  international zones you'll pay taxes to go on them those will be the first areas
[26:59.200 --> 27:03.960]  seated like embassies to international North American Union controlled
[27:03.960 --> 27:07.560]  administered by the IMF and World Bank International Bank of Settlements that
[27:07.560 --> 27:11.760]  is all in the SPP documents particularly the ones that judicial watch sued to get
[27:11.760 --> 27:24.280]  from September 2007 September 23rd 24th in Banff Canada the entire minutes we
[27:24.280 --> 27:30.120]  got them and it says first issue keep it secret from the public second issue this
[27:30.120 --> 27:36.120]  is for the carbon credit tax system where you will pay to use the roads and the
[27:36.120 --> 27:40.320]  money from seizing the 34 major interstate highways and all the sub
[27:40.320 --> 27:47.200]  state corollary highways capillary highways that this will raise hundreds of
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.480]  millions of year to fund the North American Union and it's all available on
[27:52.480 --> 27:56.320]  judicial watch his own website it's all in my film in game for blue a blueprint
[27:56.320 --> 28:02.040]  for global enslavement so knowing all of this we understand that instead of
[28:02.040 --> 28:05.040]  announcing the North American Union highways they broke it up into the
[28:05.040 --> 28:10.040]  Indiana corridor the Oklahoma corridor the California Canamax corridor the
[28:10.040 --> 28:20.120]  Arizona Canadian corridor the Florida corridor and the main artery the I-35
[28:20.120 --> 28:28.000]  trans-Texas corridor that goes all the way up into Canada now remember two years
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.600]  ago the Texas legislature that's about to go into session again they passed a
[28:32.600 --> 28:36.200]  law against turning existing roads over to toll roads the governor just vetoed
[28:36.200 --> 28:40.640]  it they announced the plan was dead took to fool everybody and then move forward
[28:40.640 --> 28:45.440]  and put the toll roads in we're gonna come back break down the basic facts here
[28:45.440 --> 28:49.680]  and I'm gonna get Paul Watson or Steve Watson or Curtin Emma one of our guys to

[32:21.160 --> 32:28.560]  never been with anything less than a dime so fine I've been on fire with Sally
[32:28.560 --> 32:36.640]  filled on fast with a girl named Bo but somehow they just don't end up as mine
[32:36.640 --> 32:44.640]  it's a death defying life I lead I take my chances I dive for a living in the

[33:09.120 --> 33:16.560]  star welcome back ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us all right
[33:16.560 --> 33:22.480]  I've never spent much time in school but I thought let's go ahead and break down
[33:22.480 --> 33:32.600]  the basic facts trans texas corridor is dead at tex dot says and this is out of
[33:32.600 --> 33:36.720]  the Dallas morning news yesterday we covered this the end of the show and
[33:36.720 --> 33:43.080]  why am I getting back into this right now because I got emails I saw comments
[33:43.080 --> 33:50.280]  posted on info wars dot com when we posted a link to this story with people
[33:50.280 --> 33:55.360]  questioning whether I was right or not by saying that the trans texas corridor
[33:55.360 --> 34:03.560]  is not dead and that this is yet another deception by government that doesn't
[34:03.560 --> 34:08.000]  work for the people but works for foreign outside interest now this is a
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.720]  microcosm of everything else we deal with in government the trans texas
[34:12.720 --> 34:18.600]  corridor itself was already a deception because all these other trans
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.200]  corridors are all part in the federal documents and in public admissions of
[34:23.200 --> 34:29.720]  the larger NAFTA super highway security and prosperity partnership system to
[34:29.720 --> 34:34.560]  take over every major federal and state highway in the United States and place
[34:34.560 --> 34:39.240]  international tolls on it to foreign private companies with a large portion
[34:39.240 --> 34:43.960]  of it then shared with the state county federal and international bureaucracy
[34:43.960 --> 34:49.920]  under the North American Union same things happening in chili same things
[34:49.920 --> 34:53.520]  happening in Greece same things happening in Argentina same things
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.600]  happening in Iceland they are coming in buying off your politicians at the local
[34:58.600 --> 35:03.280]  level and then they just sign on to the international agreements and then lie to
[35:03.280 --> 35:07.120]  the public and a lot of times when they get caught lying they say well we have
[35:07.120 --> 35:10.440]  to do this we've signed corporate agreements the state signed international
[35:10.440 --> 35:13.880]  treaties that's what these agreements are well they're frauds and we say you
[35:13.880 --> 35:18.440]  break them and you break them now instead of lying to us now so the trans
[35:18.440 --> 35:23.200]  texas corridor itself is the crown jewel of all this it's got the main
[35:23.200 --> 35:27.840]  super artery i-35 up the middle that they admit is the center of the whole
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.600]  program nationwide and the furthest along
[35:33.120 --> 35:37.920]  and so Texans found out it was 8,000 miles of roads Texans found out that it
[35:37.920 --> 35:40.800]  would according to their text on documents two years ago in the state
[35:40.800 --> 35:46.680]  legislature the state legislature had to sue and then go to state court to make
[35:46.680 --> 35:54.160]  text dot the agency give them the agreements and documents the financial
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.920]  details and it turned out that basically no money was being paid by
[35:59.920 --> 36:05.960]  centra one of the companies based out of spain the same time they merged with a
[36:05.960 --> 36:12.320]  australian company became centra Zachary and so that big hoopla forced
[36:12.320 --> 36:17.400]  center to say okay we'll pay 500 million to the state to basically get all the
[36:17.400 --> 36:21.920]  major roads in texas and make hundreds of billions in just the first decade
[36:21.920 --> 36:28.600]  hundreds of billions every year nation why what these companies would get and
[36:28.600 --> 36:34.160]  then the state passed a law the legislature that's who runs the state
[36:34.160 --> 36:38.600]  they passed a law saying you can't have any more of these toll roads and you
[36:38.600 --> 36:42.720]  can't put them on existing roads so what did tax dot and rick perry announced
[36:42.720 --> 36:46.480]  he said okay you win it's all over no more toll roads and everybody went wait
[36:46.480 --> 36:50.000]  a minute the toll roads in Dallas in houston and austin all over the country
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.800]  that all over the state there they're still going in rick perry said oh well
[36:53.800 --> 36:58.440]  I'll just sign a veto of that bill and it's gonna go forward so see they played
[36:58.440 --> 37:04.160]  possum there because at these text dot meetings you'll have 1200 1400 1500
[37:04.160 --> 37:09.040]  some cases 2000 people where the buildings won't even hold them all there
[37:09.040 --> 37:12.600]  was one case here in austin where people were stomping so loud in the big
[37:12.600 --> 37:15.800]  auditorium above because the bottom auditorium filled up that the whole
[37:15.800 --> 37:21.120]  building was shaking they had a raise of hands who's for the trans-texas
[37:21.120 --> 37:25.720]  corridor and who's against it six people out of a thousand in the main
[37:25.720 --> 37:29.040]  auditorium raised their hands for it
[37:31.120 --> 37:36.720]  so what do they do by way of deception that's what they do so now they're
[37:36.720 --> 37:40.080]  coming out and saying in the headline trans-texas corridor is dead text dot
[37:40.080 --> 37:42.680]  says the austin department transportation announced this morning that it
[37:42.680 --> 37:46.360]  is officially killed trans-texas corridor saying that despite the projects
[37:46.360 --> 37:50.360]  visionary aspects it is clearly not the choice of texas they're saying okay it's
[37:50.360 --> 37:55.480]  visionary but texas aren't visionary and you don't want it dmv file the
[37:55.480 --> 37:57.680]  announcement comes six years after governor rick perry shook up the state
[37:57.680 --> 38:00.600]  transportation political circles by unveiling an ambitious plan to stretch
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.960]  highways rail lines utilities for hundreds of miles it's 8000 miles along
[38:04.960 --> 38:09.120]  the interstate 35 and interstate 69 corridors so they deceive there by
[38:09.120 --> 38:12.600]  claiming it's only a few projects the plan which would have cost tens of
[38:12.600 --> 38:15.920]  billions of dollars and relied heavily on private toll roads was hugely
[38:15.920 --> 38:20.280]  controversial now if you live in south texas east texas west texas anywhere you
[38:20.280 --> 38:22.880]  know they were taking over your state highways and saying they were going to
[38:22.880 --> 38:26.200]  put tolls on them so you know that's a lie right there when they say it was just
[38:26.200 --> 38:32.960]  at 35 and 69 again it's all deception the plan which would have cost tens of
[38:32.960 --> 38:35.720]  billions of dollars relied heavily on private toll roads will see no the
[38:35.720 --> 38:39.560]  citizens paid for it and then they just get to collect the money off of it was
[38:39.560 --> 38:47.880]  hugely controversial a mondio senez executive director of text dot made the
[38:47.880 --> 38:51.880]  announcement that the agency was giving up on the idea that the annual
[38:51.880 --> 38:56.600]  transportation forum in austin make no mistake the transsexist corridor as we
[38:56.600 --> 39:03.920]  have known it no longer exist oh as we have known it each of the dozens of
[39:03.920 --> 39:07.680]  projects wait I just thought it was just two projects now it's dozens three
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.880]  paragraphs later each of the dozens of projects were linked together under the
[39:12.880 --> 39:17.400]  rubric of the TTC including the loop nine project in Dallas the I-69 project in
[39:17.400 --> 39:23.240]  the south will remain as standalone projects he said see and if you read his
[39:23.240 --> 39:27.800]  full-press release it all continues all of it every bit they're just changing the
[39:27.800 --> 39:33.640]  name the concept has been diminished he said we recognize the inevitable the
[39:33.640 --> 39:37.880]  TTC is not the choice of Texan so but where has it been diminished only in
[39:37.880 --> 39:43.120]  name the real impact of today's news is symbolic oh then the writer wants you to
[39:43.120 --> 39:46.880]  know that they really get this is all fraud so they just put a little read
[39:46.880 --> 39:50.760]  between the lines the real impact of today's news is symbolic signaling a
[39:50.760 --> 39:56.560]  strategic retreat from an in battle agency and is it strategic deception the
[39:56.560 --> 40:01.480]  real impact of today's news is symbolic signaling a strategic retreat by an
[40:01.480 --> 40:07.400]  battle agency as its chief political sponsor governor Rick Perry who had to
[40:07.400 --> 40:11.800]  rig up a four-way race so you get reelected what do you get 39% of the
[40:11.800 --> 40:22.200]  vote and it just goes on the legislature has been clear they want
[40:22.200 --> 40:27.960]  transformation he said that handwriting is on the wall in big bowl letters that's
[40:27.960 --> 40:32.600]  little double-speak saying the legislature that that the political
[40:32.600 --> 40:37.800]  energy of the people angry about this is taking over the legislature with
[40:37.800 --> 40:41.040]  anti-new-world order people and that's what's happening so see they have to
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.360]  back off because a big frontal assault by the New World Order to take over our
[40:45.360 --> 40:48.360]  infrastructure and they're grabbing the power plants the water districts the
[40:48.360 --> 40:53.680]  lakes that mean the foreigners are stealing everything right now the
[40:53.680 --> 40:56.360]  private companies that come in and take over the lakes and the water districts
[40:56.360 --> 41:00.440]  are hiring their own armored SWAT teams which are private SWAT teams with
[41:00.440 --> 41:09.360]  police power chartered under state city charters it's totally illegal they're
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.400]  just doing it just like it's illegal under state law and regulation for all
[41:14.400 --> 41:20.240]  these red light cameras Texas law says you can't have them I've had legislators
[41:20.240 --> 41:25.120]  on they supposedly amended the law but that meant if they jumped through all
[41:25.120 --> 41:28.160]  the hoops and they didn't they don't get the state permits they don't get the
[41:28.160 --> 41:33.640]  county or city permits they don't go register as a private detective agency
[41:33.640 --> 41:39.600]  because only a police officer or a private detective registered our sworn
[41:39.600 --> 41:49.440]  peace officer bonded or a bonded certified licensed private detective can
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.560]  gather information on individuals for a criminal investigation same reason they
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.120]  had to remove red light cameras five years ago in San Diego you can't have a
[41:58.120 --> 42:02.200]  Lockheed Martin Marietta owned red light system making millions of dollars a
[42:02.200 --> 42:05.960]  year per red light who they got caught by the way shortening the red light
[42:05.960 --> 42:09.160]  shortening the yellow light to actually get more people to actually slide out in
[42:09.160 --> 42:14.520]  the intersection it caused a bunch of wrecks that was a side issue so many
[42:14.520 --> 42:22.880]  facets no you can't just no judge no jury no ticket no witness other than a
[42:22.880 --> 42:29.600]  camera there was no process it was bypassing our entire system of checks
[42:29.600 --> 42:33.920]  and balances and innocent until proven guilty it was bypassing the fact that
[42:33.920 --> 42:41.760]  sworn magistrates and sworn elected sheriffs in chartered police agencies
[42:41.760 --> 42:46.960]  are the only ones that can be out there writing tickets do they care no they
[42:46.960 --> 42:50.960]  just the city of Austin I never played these a few weeks ago and happened I
[42:50.960 --> 42:56.360]  meant to get to it but you can go to YouTube and type in red light cameras
[42:56.360 --> 43:00.440]  Austin and you'll see the local newscast where this city just said we
[43:00.440 --> 43:05.000]  don't care if it's illegal the red lights stay the red light cameras stay other
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.440]  cities are pulling them out because of the state court rulings saying this is
[43:09.440 --> 43:13.680]  illegal and the red light camera company doing this doesn't even care they
[43:13.680 --> 43:16.880]  don't even bother to go out when they're confronted with this and get the
[43:16.880 --> 43:24.200]  private investigator license by the way they just can't get one private
[43:24.200 --> 43:30.200]  investigator license every technician certified for every camera they're
[43:30.200 --> 43:36.800]  operating has to go get the private investigator license and still the
[43:36.800 --> 43:39.520]  federal and state courts have rolled over and over again that is a fraud
[43:39.520 --> 43:50.640]  because the original progenitor of the citation is a computer is a camera but
[43:50.640 --> 43:54.200]  this has to be fought out in the courts just like family courts set up at the
[43:54.200 --> 43:58.280]  turn of the last century to carry out eugenics openly that's why they were
[43:58.280 --> 44:02.160]  chartered to take people's children to sterilize them to sterilize women to do
[44:02.160 --> 44:06.280]  medical testing on people there was no jury there was no due process there was
[44:06.280 --> 44:10.960]  no grand jury indictment there was no arrest warrant they just come steal your
[44:10.960 --> 44:16.720]  children and then you go before a judge who works for the family court system
[44:16.720 --> 44:22.920]  that's predatory and it's a rigged game see it's not due process it's not a
[44:22.920 --> 44:27.240]  proper constitutional court it is a fraud and I've already digressed off the
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.720]  subject of the trans-Texas corridor it's just that most governmental actions
[44:31.720 --> 44:39.080]  are frauds and now it's going to the extreme with the LCRA a private
[44:39.080 --> 44:48.240]  organization private profits it's just that the legislature through a board
[44:48.240 --> 44:54.040]  appoints its directors take the lower Colorado River Authority grabbing up
[44:54.040 --> 44:57.760]  water grabbing up the rivers grabbing up the lakes armed SWAT teams police
[44:57.760 --> 45:01.120]  harassing people they've got surveillance cameras all over Austin and other
[45:01.120 --> 45:09.920]  cities they control it's an intelligence operation what are they up to they
[45:09.920 --> 45:14.520]  now have governmental power and they're a private group it's a total fraud but
[45:14.520 --> 45:18.720]  it's not being challenged just like these stinking red light cameras are a
[45:18.720 --> 45:25.800]  fraud and if the police unions knew what was good for them they'd be fighting
[45:25.800 --> 45:28.760]  against all of this because you're gonna be replaced with mercenaries with
[45:28.760 --> 45:33.440]  contractors with computer systems which are totally unaccountable to the people
[45:33.440 --> 45:38.160]  and it's bad and corrupt and out of control most police agencies are in this
[45:38.160 --> 45:47.880]  nation these private corporations coming into the mix is even worse so in the
[45:47.880 --> 45:53.480]  final equation I need Kurt or Paul Steve Aaron whoever wants to take this
[45:53.480 --> 45:59.120]  mission on oh you're listening guys we need a basic article that has the
[45:59.120 --> 46:08.640]  headline trans texas corridor is not dead text dot
[46:11.320 --> 46:20.360]  plans to change the name at upcoming meeting or something like that and then
[46:20.360 --> 46:23.280]  you give the facts you can pull up just google it and pull up hundreds of articles
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.520]  guys and even written stories about it where the legislature said no you can't
[46:27.520 --> 46:30.200]  have these toll roads and existing roads you can't have a foreign company doing
[46:30.200 --> 46:33.240]  this and by the way we're not even being paid money you're just handing these
[46:33.240 --> 46:36.960]  over and you know these bids weren't done properly and you just gave it to one
[46:36.960 --> 46:41.000]  company and this is a scam and this is internationalist and legislature wasn't
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.440]  consulted they said okay it's dead you're right you win I told people I said
[46:45.440 --> 46:48.880]  that's a fraud and then six months later oh by the way we're still doing it all
[46:48.880 --> 46:52.920]  the governor just says he doesn't care what the state says number one you open
[46:52.920 --> 46:56.120]  with that and you show how they've done this all over the country and how it's
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.560]  part of the larger not a super highway grid put some of those maps up federal
[47:00.560 --> 47:05.200]  state maps then you explain with his own quotes that oh we're just breaking these
[47:05.200 --> 47:10.200]  projects up into sub projects and it's going to continue on but each project
[47:10.200 --> 47:14.280]  separately so the public can't organize against the whole operation now they
[47:14.280 --> 47:18.440]  have to organize individually in in each regional area and the globalist will
[47:18.440 --> 47:23.440]  have a better chance of getting most of this project done eight thousand square
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.600]  miles corridor watch has a lot of the documents and information in the
[47:27.600 --> 47:32.360]  hundreds of cities and over a hundred counties now last time I checked signed
[47:32.360 --> 47:38.320]  up against it and so we don't let this deception work we explain to people this
[47:38.320 --> 47:51.080]  is a strategic fraud as the article says it says it is strategic and the
[47:51.080 --> 47:54.040]  article goes on others feared the use of private toll roads developers including
[47:54.040 --> 47:58.240]  firms based in Spain would amount to a foreign ownership of Texas roads I'll
[47:58.240 --> 48:02.240]  never forget the Austin Chronicle wrote an article fears ago saying that we were
[48:02.240 --> 48:07.760]  not telling the truth and that central wasn't Spanish I mean that's like it's
[48:07.760 --> 48:14.200]  just it's just never ends what these people do it never ends how stupid they
[48:14.200 --> 48:21.000]  think the public is so this is an outrageous fraud and it will work
[48:21.000 --> 48:27.440]  partially for a while it'll buy him time I mean they're slapping every few
[48:27.440 --> 48:30.480]  weeks around Texas I see reports of a new toll road and they're doing on
[48:30.480 --> 48:34.000]  existing roads what the way they get around federal and state law that you
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.760]  can't make an existing road a toll road a freeway a toll road that taxpayers
[48:38.760 --> 48:44.120]  already paid for it's already budgeted in for us to pay for it is they will add
[48:44.120 --> 48:48.120]  an extra shoulder or they'll add another lane or they'll fix a bridge they'll say
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.240]  oh now the whole thing's a new road or they'll change the name of the road all
[48:52.240 --> 49:00.560]  lawyer scams and then of course federal law had said before you couldn't make
[49:00.560 --> 49:05.280]  existing roads toll roads well Bush has signed an executive order last year
[49:05.280 --> 49:09.960]  stating that if states want their toll road or want their department
[49:09.960 --> 49:12.840]  transportation federal money which money they take from us and send back that
[49:12.840 --> 49:18.840]  they have to hand their roads over to foreign interest talk about a fraud and
[49:18.840 --> 49:23.400]  now Obama talks about this big highway project he's got I've looked at it all
[49:23.400 --> 49:30.240]  the money is to force states to put toll roads in and to hand it over to foreign
[49:30.240 --> 49:37.800]  interest see this is the problem with federalization because all the foreign
[49:37.800 --> 49:41.120]  banks had to do was buy off our government which they did and then
[49:41.120 --> 49:46.160]  everything's theirs they own the government through fraud just like we're
[49:46.160 --> 49:50.240]  paying 8.5 trillion into foreign private banks and then we have to pay them
[49:50.240 --> 49:54.800]  interest on the money that we gave them oh here's all our money and then we get
[49:54.800 --> 49:59.560]  to pay you interest for giving you all our money in taxes we'll be right back

[52:58.400 --> 53:20.360]  today at 877-715-4448 that's 877-715-4448 we have to get to the point
[53:20.360 --> 53:29.720]  where we realize just how corrupt the society is and that with the corrupt
[53:29.720 --> 53:34.880]  government came the power for outside government's institutions
[53:34.880 --> 53:40.800]  corporations allied crime syndicates of corporations as what the new world
[53:40.800 --> 53:45.680]  order is to come in and take over everything folks China didn't have a
[53:45.680 --> 53:51.080]  strong sovereign government a hundred and sixty years ago so the British the
[53:51.080 --> 53:56.160]  Dutch the French the Spanish the US they went in and they divided the country up
[53:56.160 --> 54:00.480]  into ten parts and it happened just like it's happening today the British
[54:00.480 --> 54:03.960]  started bringing in opium over 20 years they bought off all the police because
[54:03.960 --> 54:08.000]  opium was illegal there it brought great corruption they took over the major
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.040]  seaport towns within just a few years then they moved in internally and used
[54:12.040 --> 54:15.840]  that corruption to take over the country then they brought in mercenary
[54:15.840 --> 54:21.880]  armies to protect each sector they completely looted the nation and that
[54:21.880 --> 54:25.960]  went on right up until 1949 when the CIA helped put Moussey tongue into power
[54:25.960 --> 54:29.440]  and that's now declassified that's not just the old-timers blowing the whistle
[54:29.440 --> 54:34.840]  on it as they did at the time David Rockefeller wrote his memoirs well two
[54:34.840 --> 54:37.600]  memoirs he wrote about how great Mao was he wrote the New York Times how great
[54:37.600 --> 54:40.480]  it was and how we want that system here you go why would one of the richest
[54:40.480 --> 54:44.160]  male on earth want communism is it communism it's a bunch of thugs with
[54:44.160 --> 54:48.280]  guns saying it's for the people we're taking all the middle classes wealth and
[54:48.280 --> 54:52.120]  land it's for the people and they just handed over to the international
[54:52.120 --> 54:57.760]  corporations a side issue that I'm going to cover in more detail on prison
[54:57.760 --> 55:03.240]  planet dot tv today when we go live at one o'clock central coming up in an
[55:03.240 --> 55:10.240]  hour and five minutes organic whole milk horizon organic milk and I was
[55:10.240 --> 55:14.760]  sitting there last night looking at it on the counter actually my wife wasn't
[55:14.760 --> 55:18.400]  pointed it out she said look our farms produced this milk without antibiotics
[55:18.400 --> 55:25.680]  added hormones pesticides or cloning they have to say this is not cloned milk
[55:25.680 --> 55:31.360]  from a cloned cow and why is that because we now learn for at least nine
[55:31.360 --> 55:38.680]  years in Canada the United States that large dairy operations have cloned
[55:38.680 --> 55:45.520]  cows or or cows from the offspring offspring of cloned cows and why is
[55:45.520 --> 55:48.440]  this not just that they give the growth hormone to the cows that makes them
[55:48.440 --> 55:53.160]  produce three times much milk they find genetic freaks who have been engineered
[55:53.160 --> 55:57.960]  to produce massive amounts of milk and then they breed those cloned animals
[55:57.960 --> 56:02.720]  together with all the bizarre DNA alterations that happen there as well so
[56:02.720 --> 56:10.440]  we're to the point of having to deal with cloned milk or milk from cloned
[56:10.440 --> 56:16.720]  animals or from cloned herds and I say this because a few weeks ago I mentioned
[56:16.720 --> 56:22.320]  that there's cloned milk on store shelves everywhere and I got emails and
[56:22.320 --> 56:25.040]  people laughing at me saying we're you know that's ridiculous folks we're in
[56:25.040 --> 56:29.480]  the 21st century it's 2009 this stuff is going on this is the new world order
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.000]  we're not the science fiction movie we're in reality I'm sitting here in my
[56:33.000 --> 56:41.200]  hand you can hear the milk having to tell you it's not cloned you know they've
[56:41.200 --> 56:45.800]  got chickens that have four legs so they have more meat on them did you know
[56:45.800 --> 56:50.760]  that people are trying to buy small farms trying to find original heirloom I
[56:50.760 --> 56:55.160]  guess you'd call them old-fashioned chickens and that's hard to get them and
[56:55.160 --> 57:03.120]  then small farms now are buying the big GMO engineered chickens and they develop
[57:03.120 --> 57:07.280]  within seven weeks not 12 to 14 weeks they've got so much meat on their
[57:07.280 --> 57:11.540]  bones the turkeys to that they can't even walk after their full grown they
[57:11.540 --> 57:14.720]  just sit there in the bottom of their cage they're designed for big factories
[57:14.720 --> 57:18.800]  they're totally genetically engineered and altered they have all sorts of other
[57:18.800 --> 57:25.000]  organisms DNA put into them it's got all sorts of horrible spinoff effects and
[57:25.000 --> 57:37.000]  so then the small farms can't even economically find breeder stock for
[57:37.000 --> 57:43.240]  geese same thing for pigs now they are just they are basically eradicating all
[57:43.240 --> 57:48.840]  the original lifeforms so enjoy your cloned milk folks

[58:13.240 --> 58:26.720]  David Rockefeller that's for a lateral commission to see far seven years after
[58:26.720 --> 58:30.760]  the attacks of September 11th a global awakening has taken place

[59:00.480 --> 59:09.800]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[59:12.800 --> 59:20.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[59:20.560 --> 59:28.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[59:28.080 --> 59:34.160]  Alex Jones in one hour we will be simulcasting the radio show at
[59:34.160 --> 59:42.120]  prisonplanet.tv I'm gonna go over the latest shooting of an unarmed man
[59:42.120 --> 59:46.680]  restrained by police and the fact that police lied about what really happened
[59:46.680 --> 59:51.840]  then we've got Ray McGovern joining us I also want to show folks on the TV show
[59:51.840 --> 59:57.600]  and I'll discuss it on radio and then later it'll be posted on the web as an
[59:57.600 --> 1:00:01.840]  archive that now the organic milk companies are having to put that their
[1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:06.040]  cows don't come from cloned herds because that's how far cloning has gone
[1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:10.280]  and we'll break down some of the dangers of that briefly as well Ray McGovern
[1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:16.000]  joins us and then Barry Cooper in the studio former police officer narcotics
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  officer who's been out there busting cops running all sorts of scams he is
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:25.720]  going to be in studio with us today so that is very exciting and will be live
[1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:34.200]  with us at prisonplanet.tv before our first guest comes on Eric Plumlee
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:38.120]  attorney on cell phone surveillance I wanted to play a little clip to break it
[1:00:38.120 --> 1:00:43.440]  down of a little compilation of mainstream newscast that I saw on YouTube
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:47.560]  a few days ago that spurred us to get him on the show and again this is kind of
[1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:52.480]  old hat for myself and our main audience that's been here for some cases 13
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:59.280]  years because I've been covering it for 12 or almost 13 since 2006 when I read
[1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:02.760]  the telecommunications act that stated all of this people said oh that's a
[1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:07.880]  conspiracy by federal law the cell phones are designed toward the NSA or any
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:11.000]  other private group and they admit in these newscasts that private citizens
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.520]  can do this as well it's just a felony of YouTube dial in to somebody's cell
[1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:18.520]  phone and trigger it and listen to everything you're doing even when the
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:23.560]  cell phones off and of course then it has the GPS triangulation there's not GPS
[1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:28.200]  in the phone there's GPS markers in the cell towers that triangulate you down to
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:32.360]  just a few feet federal losses within 15 feet but it really triangulates down
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:37.720]  about three and a half feet and so we'll be going over that and then realize
[1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:41.600]  it's all your other devices your home computer has Google and others in their
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:45.360]  own words using the built-in microphone to listen to you with an AI computer
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:48.840]  recording everything you say in a database and folks are worried about
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:56.480]  cookies they can also dial in to the camera that is on that is built in to
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:00.480]  almost every brand of computer now that's right above the screen that is
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:05.600]  watching you and I tell people this and they just it's so Orwellian even dumb
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.160]  down general public knows that's big brother so their instinct is it's not
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:14.120]  true or their instinct is oh it's not true they have the foreign banks have
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:18.320]  instill an 8.5 trillion and war powers act hasn't been declared and the
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:22.000]  Congress isn't under martial law and no no no everything's fine everything's
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:33.640]  fine no everything is not fine and then even when tech stock comes out with
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:36.480]  their favorite tactic of saying we're not building a nap to superhighway we're
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:40.000]  not building in trans-texas corridor then they put up the billboards that said
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.840]  trans-texas corridors are putting the toll roads in they denied they were
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:46.520]  going to put toll roads in while they were building the toll road boxes the
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:50.400]  toll road machines the toll road scanners five six years ago they would say
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:54.760]  we're not doing it we're not putting a toll road on them then they did it and
[1:02:54.760 --> 1:02:59.560]  said well it's not a toll road it's a it's a fee lane so they play
[1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:05.760]  semantical games and people in government in big corporations they're all
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:08.560]  trained in this they know their line you can see them on television and hear them
[1:03:08.560 --> 1:03:11.440]  on the radio every day read them in the newspaper they are just a lot of
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:16.400]  deceptive crooks and and that's why they're hired they compete with each
[1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:22.200]  other over who is the most deceptive and if you don't like what's happening now
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:25.720]  imagine what they're going to be doing in the future if we don't turn this
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:29.720]  around and don't educate the public about what's developing and happening
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:34.360]  speaking of prison planet dot TV our prison planet dot TV members don't just
[1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:39.760]  um you know have the archive that's upload within a few hours of the live
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:44.240]  video transmission TV show we do simulcast with radio you can watch it
[1:03:44.240 --> 1:03:48.720]  live so coming up in 55 minutes 21 seconds we'll go live at prison planet
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:51.360]  dot TV and I want to courage prison planet TV members to go over there
[1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:55.360]  log in right there at the top prison planet TV just enter your username and
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:59.200]  passcode and you're on and I want you to tune into the show make sure all the
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:04.280]  members out there use that feature all right we'll be right back with the
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:07.080]  cell phones tracking everything you're doing what's happening with the economy
[1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:12.840]  a lot more hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's
[1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:16.200]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we
[1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:19.920]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand
[1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:23.040]  in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the
[1:04:23.040 --> 1:04:27.240]  Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[1:04:27.240 --> 1:04:30.560]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bail
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:34.400]  out of special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:38.720]  off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:42.720]  out of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:46.480]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:50.520]  nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond many
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:54.760]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:59.000]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.760]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:06.480]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:10.080]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:14.240]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[1:05:14.240 --> 1:05:18.280]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:21.960]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:26.120]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:29.040]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a
[1:05:29.040 --> 1:05:32.640]  supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot less control
[1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:36.840]  over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:40.000]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.120]  E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost
[1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:53.640]  half the cost of last year's grocery prices call 1-800-409-5633 or on the
[1:05:53.640 --> 1:05:57.800]  web go to eFoodsDirect.com visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the
[1:05:57.800 --> 1:06:01.840]  final list of high-quality freeze-dried and dehydrated foods they have to offer
[1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:05.680]  watch the free videos look at their online catalog or give them a call at
[1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:13.960]  1-800-409-5633 again 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com take action
[1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:18.800]  today the first step is getting storeable food news stories recently revealed
[1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:23.240]  that the FBI used ordinary cell phones to monitor the room conversations of
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:27.720]  suspects this could be accomplished by changes to the phone's firmware the
[1:06:27.720 --> 1:06:31.400]  internal software that makes them run which might require physical access to
[1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:36.120]  the phone or could even be done remotely in some cases depending on the phone and
[1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:40.480]  the level of cellular company cooperation now unless you're a mobster
[1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:44.560]  terrorist or perhaps a peace activist you're not likely to be targeted this
[1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:48.600]  way by the authorities but it's also possible that illicit bugs could be
[1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:52.800]  implemented the same way and it's always worthwhile to know your technology so
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:56.840]  let's look at some easy clues that might suggest it's something unusual could be
[1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:00.640]  going on with your cell phone
[1:07:03.720 --> 1:07:07.720]  the trick is to remember that everything done on these phones needs
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:12.320]  electricity and that all comes from the batteries these batteries will degrade
[1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:16.200]  over time and tend to give reduced service after many charges but in
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:20.040]  general if you suddenly notice that your phone's battery is running out much
[1:07:20.040 --> 1:07:24.080]  faster than usual and you haven't been talking more this could suggest that
[1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:28.480]  your phone is busily transmitting room conversations via its microphone why you
[1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:32.680]  thought it was idle and so draining the battery more rapidly in such a case
[1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:37.360]  turning off the phone may not actually stop this behavior since firmware could
[1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:41.080]  be altered to make a phone look like it was turned off when it was actually
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:45.280]  still on taking out the battery though it's pretty much a sure thing to shut
[1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:49.960]  down all significant activity and don't worry there's not enough room in most
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:53.480]  modern cell phones for hidden extra batteries of a size that could do much
[1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:58.880]  more than keep the phone's clock running ease the t-rex of political talk
[1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:24.840]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:43.560]  all right folks we are back live here John let's go back to that cell phone
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:52.920]  clip I wanted to play more of that okay John okay fantastic yeah I mean that's
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:56.080]  like a 20 minute clip it's got a bunch of clips where the news is admitting this
[1:08:56.080 --> 1:09:01.800]  because I want to try to somehow shake the public out of their denial about how
[1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:06.000]  these devices everything that we use in our lives has been designed and set up
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.840]  to track and trace and a surveillance I mean this is a total control grid being
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:14.200]  put in here's some more guys that could do much more than keep the phones clock
[1:09:14.200 --> 1:09:24.680]  running a similar clue that your phone may be transmitting behind your back is
[1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:29.120]  if it just seems warmer than usual between calls you've probably noticed
[1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:33.240]  itself phones tend to get warm as you talk longer this is normal while calls
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:37.280]  are in progress but it would be very odd indeed if your phone didn't cool off
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:42.760]  some between calls both of these clues especially the unusually rapid draining
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:46.520]  of the phone's battery could also be indications that room audio is being
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:50.960]  recorded within the flash memory of the phone for later bulk transmission via
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:55.360]  the phone's data capabilities and bulk transmission can be more difficult to
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:00.440]  detect modern phones can contain a lot of flash memory so this is a real
[1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:03.240]  possibility
[1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:11.640]  finally if you have a conventional gsm phone the type used most around the
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:16.600]  world and the standard for both AT&T singular and T-Mobile your ears can tell
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:21.400]  you what's going on you've probably heard the annoying gsm buzz interference
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:26.600]  that can leak into speakers and other audio equipment during calls
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:35.240]  that's what an actual call sounds like a continuing post buzzing if your phone
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:38.760]  was bugging you in real time the transmission of the room audio would
[1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:43.680]  usually create this same sound if you hear it between calls that's a possible
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:47.800]  indication that your phone may have been compromised note that there is similar
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:52.160]  interference that can occur briefly between phone calls at various intervals
[1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:56.800]  for voicemail indications text messages and phone control updates to the
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:02.200]  mobile network these can occur at any time like these
[1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:13.440]  but the continuous pulsing buzzing like this
[1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:19.400]  will normally only occur during calls or continuous data transmission and
[1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:22.920]  that's the sound to be suspicious of if you hear it when your phone is
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:26.840]  supposedly idle this interference listening technique is much less useful
[1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:32.560]  if you have a CDMA technology phone like from Verizon or Sprint in the US or if
[1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:39.080]  you're using a new 3g gsm phone in 3g mode which also uses a type of CDMA
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:42.960]  technology since much less audible interference is produced from these
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:47.760]  phones you may not be able to hear it at all but the battery and heat related
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:52.600]  clues from earlier will still likely work fine even in these cases your cell
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:57.040]  phone almost certainly isn't a bug but it never hurts to know what is and
[1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:01.600]  isn't possible especially with an expanding and powerful technology that
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:07.840]  most of us carry with us wherever we go until next time be seeing you if you
[1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:11.400]  power down your cell phone there's no way the government could ever hear you
[1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:18.640]  certainly not the FBI it's turned off right have we got news for you all right
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:22.440]  here's that cell phone story you've been waiting for cell phone users beware
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:26.720]  big brother may be listening the federal Bureau of Investigation can now
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:31.640]  hear everything you say even when the cell phone is turned off I know it
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:35.960]  sounds kind of out there but using your phones tracking device authorities can
[1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:40.880]  now activate the microphone inside the dreaded thing allowing them to eavesdrop
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:45.240]  on you and your conversations serious business and the FBI used this form of
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:49.280]  surveillance to keep tabs on critical conversations by people they call known
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:54.520]  members of the mafia experts say the only way around it is to take the battery
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:59.320]  out of the thing we're gonna tell you more about the weather coming up but
[1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:03.000]  we've got something just as important coming up to its technology the FBI has
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.560]  used to nab some of the nation's most wanted mobsters and now high tech
[1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:11.720]  surveillance has found its way and what many consider their security blanket
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:15.400]  cell phones yeah that's right put on your sides Eric Herman is here now with a
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:20.840]  warning if you got a cell phone beware Eric that is right Alveda Tom we've all
[1:13:20.840 --> 1:13:23.880]  heard of hidden cameras or an office being bugged right it's been in just
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:28.120]  about every detective movie but how about being tracked your every word your
[1:13:28.120 --> 1:13:32.600]  every move followed by someone else it's happening and the culprit is
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:41.840]  something that's probably in your sight right now your cell phone who's
[1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:50.800]  watching who's listening tracking if you're willing to write the check if
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:54.880]  you're willing to spend the money then there's no phone that's not secure your
[1:13:54.880 --> 1:14:01.200]  own cell phone could be your worst enemy the eyes and ears for someone else but
[1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.680]  it's not particularly difficult a simple software download and you're in how
[1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:09.640]  much time do you actually need with a phone to have complete access to
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:14.400]  everything on it ten minutes so ten on your side decided to make an investment
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:18.880]  in your safety we're not gonna show you exactly how it's done rather a warning
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:24.120]  it can be done we bought the software online sure enough a few days later it
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:30.040]  arrived via email you've got mail of course it's very legal to do it to
[1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:33.960]  somebody without their permission so I gave Joe written permission to tap my
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:39.400]  cell phone a quick download it enables remote surveillance of your phone with
[1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:44.280]  the click of a mouse the phone's microphone can be remotely activated the
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:49.000]  same technology that allows you to use speakerphone is now a spy you can listen
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:55.200]  from any either a computer or a telephone of your choice and that's not
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:00.720]  all text messages can be monitored and locations can be tracked using GPS is
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:05.280]  there any way for the person that has the phone to know what you did to it no
[1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:10.280]  what's worse even turning the phone off doesn't stop the snooping we put it to
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:13.480]  the test we'll try to remotely activate his cell phone and there it is and we're
[1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:16.480]  good
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:30.840]  all right well listen I I should I should be there
[1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:38.240]  I'll call you as soon as I get out all right
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:45.800]  yeah I just like to make a transfer of funds please for my check my check in
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:50.840]  without please not only was Joe eavesdropping on my every word
[1:15:50.840 --> 1:16:02.840]  you know he was also following my every move who uses this but be prepared to
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:06.960]  face consequences if the person on the other end doesn't know what's happening
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:11.360]  that's where the illegality occurs okay the Chesapeake attorney Eric Plumlee
[1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:16.480]  says it and we've got Chesapeake attorney Eric Plumlee coming up in about
[1:16:16.480 --> 1:16:22.720]  14 minutes from now reason I played this is as good and informative as these
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:26.200]  little newscaster playing clips of art they don't explain to you why this ever
[1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:34.120]  happened under federal law the cell phones in 1996 had to implement this and
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:39.120]  there was a sliding scale by 2007 they had to have an agreed upon platform and
[1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:42.800]  follow what the federal government said for the applications for snooping by the
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:50.640]  NSA FBI and others by 1998 they had to have their newest cell phones equipped
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:59.360]  with this and by 2001 October 1st by law set in 1996 all phones by law have this
[1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:04.880]  in them so again the federal government did this and they're now admitting in
[1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:08.240]  England and the US at the National ID cards we carry you didn't know you had
[1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:11.760]  one even your state ID is federally controlled it's in a federal database
[1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:16.800]  that is causing massive identity theft it's those databases it's the use of
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:20.800]  those cards the media likes to act like the Internet's what's causing identity
[1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:25.560]  theft most of it is banks remember Bank of America like last year was at 3
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:30.720]  million names and whole you know where they live their pass codes everything
[1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:35.160]  quote got stolen it's people inside the companies it's like a bank robbery they
[1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:37.960]  steal millions of names they get they can sell on the black market for millions
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:43.000]  of dollars and a lot of this comes out of Pakistan out of India out of Russia out
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:46.760]  of Israel are some of the biggest nations that are safe houses where the
[1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:50.760]  government's turned a blind eye to big crime syndicates I mean whole office
[1:17:50.760 --> 1:18:00.240]  buildings filled with people using the stolen data well now Google is using its
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:03.360]  systems to listen to your computer everything over the microphone based on
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:07.640]  the computer going on in your house and then just everything else the cell
[1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:13.360]  phone situation is only the surface of a very very deep well of Orwellian
[1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:17.880]  control well it's worse than what Orwell envisioned what will you do when the

[1:19:21.840 --> 1:19:26.600]  public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999 reaching a peak of
[1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:32.160]  14.8 trillion dollars marking 10.57 percent annual increase outpacing its
[1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:36.480]  previous 10 years the US economy receives its currency by taking on debt
[1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:39.840]  through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System in
[1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:44.840]  the year 2000 debt growth collapsed to only 4.5 percent it's bad enough that
[1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:49.000]  the US citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce however shocking
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.800]  the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth

[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:37.480]  moment we're getting into a little report for 30 minutes with a lawyer that's
[1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:40.200]  out there exposing the fact that cell phones are tracking tracing and
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:46.340]  listening to you that is coming up before I get back into the financial news here
[1:23:46.340 --> 1:23:53.840]  briefly I want to tell you that you need to listen very carefully folks we have
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:58.480]  to store food for our families if we're going to stay free and stay alive that
[1:23:58.480 --> 1:24:01.680]  is the prime rule of power that you control nations with oil and people with
[1:24:01.680 --> 1:24:10.200]  food and over and over again tyrants use food as a weapon of federal control so
[1:24:10.200 --> 1:24:13.280]  if you're going to be independent it starts with firearms and food and the
[1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:16.800]  capability and the willingness to defend them and I'm not saying all these
[1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:20.360]  horrible things are going to happen though they're a probability now
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:27.440]  probability is high the point is we need to be independent and not under other
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.920]  people's control and a great way to do that is with high-quality storeable

[1:24:55.400 --> 1:25:01.000]  now on the economy later in the show to get more into this but right now let me
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:08.160]  get into some of it. Analysts predicts 40% unemployment no recovery until 2015 we
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:13.000]  beat the street.com reports on this we think we now have enough data for both
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:16.360]  the fundamentals and the technicals to make some serious forecasts and
[1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:21.040]  predictions for 09 they've been very accurate it's on this group this site
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:26.080]  while 2008 was a nasty year with lots of things imploded they're far from
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:29.520]  being repaired Treasury Secretary Paulson told us this week that there was no
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:32.800]  more surprises which they always lie remember they said two years ago we
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:36.440]  weren't in a recession which tells me we haven't even discovered the small
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:40.640]  portion of this monster derivatives mess remember they said over and over and
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:44.920]  over and over and over and over and over and over and over again that the
[1:25:44.920 --> 1:25:48.640]  economy was great two years ago with the worst of the banking crisis was over
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:54.120]  his ripping off the taxpayers the tune of 700 billion 8.5 trillion is only a
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:57.520]  warm-up however the larger question for traders and investors is what could
[1:25:57.520 --> 1:26:01.480]  happen next and when the following report we take the key global economic
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:07.520]  points and suggest the outcome of 2009 the most important news for 08 was the
[1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:11.400]  destruction of the big global banks net worth again that's a Ponzi scheme
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:14.520]  they've already moved their assets out their badly wounded ability to conduct
[1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:20.960]  normal business and make market move loan plans and then it goes on into what
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:27.960]  they believe is going to happen and that is just a deepening crisis into
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:34.120]  depression and then no way of coming out of it until 2015 now this is the head
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:40.000]  policymaker at the bank of England that is the center of the web warns that
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:44.040]  within five years global dumping of dollars assets can be complete that's
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:47.800]  right to plus years ago the world began moving away from dollars not buying as
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:51.640]  many dollars moving into an indexed basket of other world currencies yin
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:57.560]  yang ruble euro pound a former member of the bank of england's monetary policy
[1:26:57.560 --> 1:27:00.400]  committee has predicted a massive collapse of the dollar within the next
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:03.480]  two to five years warning that the government increase in spending under
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:06.880]  president elect obama could be disastrous
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:16.480]  william beautier who served as the boe from june of 97 to may 2000 has stated
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:20.400]  that he expects to see the plug pole from under the dollar as foreign investors
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:23.680]  turn away from the dollar and other u.s. backed assets including government
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:28.280]  bonds writing for the financial times of london beautier now a professor of the
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:32.080]  london school economics european institute comments let's get him on there
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:38.640]  will be before long my best guess is between two and five years from now a
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:42.640]  global dumping of u.s. dollar assets including u.s. government assets old
[1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:46.240]  habits die hard u.s. dollar the treasury bills and bonds are still viewed as a
[1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:51.160]  safe haven by many but learning takes place say more about what he had to say
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:54.920]  later as we get back into the economic news stay with us we get into the

[1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:25.960]  these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water
[1:28:25.960 --> 1:28:29.640]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are
[1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:34.360]  absorbed into the skin the kdf dual media shower filter works with both hot and

[1:30:21.080 --> 1:30:25.160]  international bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to
[1:30:25.160 --> 1:30:28.520]  create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior
[1:30:28.520 --> 1:30:32.040]  but we've only seen the beginning their next engineered crisis will be on a
[1:30:32.040 --> 1:30:36.120]  scale never before seen in modern times shortages and empty shelves will
[1:30:36.120 --> 1:30:39.720]  spread fear and panic across the land the insiders have discovered that they

[1:31:24.200 --> 1:31:38.520]  earlier in the hour i played some newscast clips
[1:31:38.520 --> 1:31:44.120]  that eric plumley was in and others breaking down that not just the
[1:31:44.120 --> 1:31:48.520]  government who by law made the cell phone manufacturers
[1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:53.640]  put these surveillance platforms into all phones by law october 1st 2001 the
[1:31:53.640 --> 1:31:56.360]  past law 96 but again gave them that time to
[1:31:56.360 --> 1:32:01.080]  have it by law on all phones but that folks can buy the software download the
[1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:04.760]  software and do it to anybody else they wish you can also easily
[1:32:04.760 --> 1:32:07.720]  not just tune into somebody's phone even when it's turned off you take the
[1:32:07.720 --> 1:32:13.400]  battery out to stop it from happening but also physically track you
[1:32:13.400 --> 1:32:16.600]  and finally the public is figuring this out but this is being engineered into
[1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:21.400]  all major communications platforms so i wanted to talk to
[1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:24.760]  this attorney and find out how he got involved in all of this he does criminal
[1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:28.360]  law domestic relations family law divorce felonies misdemeanors
[1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:33.800]  and he joins us now thank you for coming on sir
[1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:37.160]  sure thanks for having me tell us a little bit about yourself and how you
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:41.320]  got involved in all of this well i'd as you just stated i am a
[1:32:41.320 --> 1:32:45.400]  a criminal defense attorney and i do a ton of domestic relations law and
[1:32:45.400 --> 1:32:48.680]  as you would imagine there's a tremendous amount of overlap
[1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:52.840]  in between those two practice areas and it comes up frequently
[1:32:52.840 --> 1:32:57.800]  where criminal charges actually stem from domestic relations matters where
[1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.680]  somebody has just gone too far to try to
[1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:06.120]  surveil a suspected cheating spouse or to gain some advantage in a custody
[1:33:06.120 --> 1:33:10.680]  proceeding or something of that nature and so it comes up in the
[1:33:10.680 --> 1:33:15.560]  practice area as far as my appearance on the local tv
[1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:19.880]  station it's it's not it wasn't uncommon for me to do certain things and it was
[1:33:19.880 --> 1:33:22.200]  actually their brainchild because they had
[1:33:22.200 --> 1:33:25.720]  i guess been tipped off to this the sort of disturbing
[1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:29.960]  way that people can be tracked in and monitored and they wanted to
[1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:33.720]  to get a little snippet of the legality of it all or
[1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:37.400]  in this case the illegality of it all well that's why we have you here because
[1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:41.240]  this is becoming very widespread no one knows exactly how i spread the federal
[1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:46.120]  government has been caught to you the fbi using on star which is a cell phone
[1:33:46.120 --> 1:33:50.520]  platform to tune in and surveil people we know the nsa has been doing and they
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:53.080]  brag about it and it's being used against the general public
[1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:57.240]  without warrants many times but your particular entry into this whole
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:01.240]  fracas is then dealing with these custody battles or cases
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:04.920]  where husbands and wives are spying on each other let's look at that aspect
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:08.840]  because that's your expertise i mean break down exactly the
[1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:12.200]  different formats of the different ways people are being spied on or their
[1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:16.200]  location being tracked or audibly being listened to
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:20.280]  and from your view in this how widespread it is
[1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:23.560]  well you know it's it's interesting how you would think that there would be
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:27.320]  a logical continuum of what's legal
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:30.680]  and then what is not and that it would it would seem to
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:35.240]  if you if you could do x then y would certainly not be permissible or vice
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:38.440]  versa but it's kind of weird the way it's chopped up
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:43.320]  if you have a telephone conversation that you are a party to contrary to
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:45.560]  popular belief in the commonwealth virginia
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:49.720]  you can actually tape record a conversation that you're a party to
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:53.960]  without the permission of the other party most states only connecticut and a
[1:34:53.960 --> 1:34:57.960]  few others don't let you do that they call that the
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:35:01.960]  wiretapping laws correct well wiretapping in virginia takes on a
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:04.680]  little bit of a different characteristic where wiretapping in
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:09.400]  under virginia statutes anticipate and encompassed under the wiretapping is
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:13.240]  really also a prohibition against somebody dropping a pocket recorder in a
[1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:17.320]  room of other people and then walking out and intercepting oral
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:20.760]  communication that all is kind of encompassed under the wiretapping
[1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:26.520]  statute but wiretapping is is is taken as someone else's
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:31.480]  communications either cell phone or landline or like i said even a face to
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:34.760]  face communication and then somehow intercepting that
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:39.640]  but it doesn't prohibit recording a call that you're a party to neither
[1:35:39.640 --> 1:35:42.280]  does it prohibit if you and i are having this
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:47.960]  conversation privately and uh... joe investigators says
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:51.320]  hey uh... hey um actually i'm having a conversation
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:54.920]  with you and you've and you've told joe investigator hey
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:58.440]  uh... you can record this conversation even though he's not a party to it he
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:01.320]  can record it because he has the consent of at least one of us
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:03.880]  so that would be permissible under virginia law
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:06.760]  the interesting part about how it breaks down
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:11.240]  is if you i'm talking to let's say my wife and she and i are
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:15.640]  uh... in a heated battle and we're we're going into custody proceedings
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:19.640]  and i record her a conversation with her
[1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:23.720]  and she says you'll never see the kids again and then i try to use that
[1:36:23.720 --> 1:36:28.120]  recording in the domestic proceedings i cannot do that
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:31.640]  unless i have told her at the outset of the conversation
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:35.320]  that i am recording her i have to put her on notice of that
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:39.800]  now that same prohibition doesn't um doesn't exist where
[1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:44.120]  if i am recording the conversation and she says oh yeah
[1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:46.680]  you're never going to see the kids again because i'm going to get a gun and i'm
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:50.360]  going to shoot you and kill you now she's made a threat over the telephone
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.280]  which is obviously a criminal offense and i can use that recording any
[1:36:54.280 --> 1:36:57.400]  criminal proceeding even though she didn't have notice of it
[1:36:57.400 --> 1:37:00.840]  so it can be used at some points and not at others
[1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:04.040]  um and then of course there's the whole reasonable
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:09.400]  reasonable perception of privacy uh... if if i'm walking down the street with
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:13.000]  an audio recorder and people are walking by me talking
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:17.400]  i from what i've studied can't get in trouble for doing that because i'm in a
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:21.720]  uh... public place but if i go put a recorder over my back neighbor's fence
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.640]  and try to record him on his property uh... that would be
[1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:29.560]  some type of eavesdropping or or wiretapping offense in most states
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:33.400]  right that that's probably true usually what you do in public use of
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:37.800]  you subject yourself to free game now there there are obviously some statutes
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:38.520]  that are
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:42.600]  on the books to address issues of peeping and that kind of stuff you know
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:46.600]  where if you got a uh... a lady walking through the shopping mall in a mini
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:48.840]  skirt you know that even though she's in public
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:52.360]  there's specific statutes that says they don't don't use your tow mirrors and
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:55.960]  don't use your little all pocket cameras to try to shoot up
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:37:59.560]  uh... yeah because that's going to that's going into her private space now
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:03.320]  expanding on that and i want to get back into the cell phones themselves
[1:38:03.320 --> 1:38:06.840]  uh... we see all these videos and news articles from all over the nation
[1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:10.600]  where somebody will videotape the police even from their own front yard
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:14.440]  or have surveillance cameras on their house and then when people try to
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:17.480]  use that against the police there's been cases of police coming and arresting
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:19.880]  them saying that that was wiretapping
[1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:23.400]  which is ridiculous because uh... again there is no
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:26.760]  reasonable expectation of privacy out in the open air
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:29.240]  and i've had police walk up to me around the nation and say turn your
[1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:30.680]  cameras off you don't have permission
[1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:34.120]  when i'm on a city street well they don't have any expectation
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:37.080]  of privacy and and and that's all been litigated out in court
[1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:40.680]  and the police have lost in every case but they don't care they continue all
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:44.920]  across the nation to claim you don't have a right to videotape them
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:48.120]  yeah you know and i'm not been involved in either civil disputes that that
[1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:50.520]  result from somebody you know kind of
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:54.360]  the rodney king reginald denny type recording that that i guess
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:58.280]  probably some of the some of the forerunners of of this very
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:01.560]  popular taping of these public incidents especially those that involve the
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:04.760]  police uh... i've never had the opportunity to litigate that in the
[1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:06.040]  civil arena
[1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:09.560]  well i just know that let's say i go down to get some crowd shots on new
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:12.840]  years for a documentary i'm making of what crowds think about
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:17.320]  sabarack obama i was just doing that last week is i'm making a film about him
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:20.680]  and i you know we'll always have a few
[1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:24.040]  aggressive nuts are people who don't like me come say hey you have permission to
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:27.320]  be videotaping me and when i'm shooting crowds of people and i say listen
[1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:31.000]  you're walking down a public street in the middle of the music district
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:36.200]  you do not have any privacy i'm sorry and that's what the news does under news
[1:39:36.200 --> 1:39:39.160]  gathering if i'm making an entertainment film
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:42.440]  i would have to get each and every person uh...
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:46.040]  in some circumstances to sign a waiver form but i'm doing news gathering or
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:47.960]  first amendment i'm protected
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:51.000]  right and i think that is my understanding of it as well and
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:55.640]  i know it gets somewhat gray in a little bit more complicated if you're in
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:58.120]  in in you in you touch on this when you said if you're going to use it for
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:02.280]  entertainment value but if you were going to take that person's likeness
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:04.680]  and somehow use it for marketing purposes
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:08.520]  or something that would be for pecuniary uh... again
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:11.480]  then you would obviously have a problem with using their image without their
[1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:14.920]  concern but as you say they're on a public street and you're filming a
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:17.560]  documentary or you get your camera rolling because
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:20.840]  you just enjoy filming crowds like you're instead of a birdwatcher you're a
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:24.280]  crowd watcher i don't think there's any prohibition against it
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:27.480]  now there's clearly not out now uh...
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:30.840]  in the time we have left with you specifically getting back to the cell
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:34.360]  phones without getting into any attorney client privilege
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:37.320]  uh... cases you've looked at cases you've studied
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:40.920]  uh... i mean how does this normally transpire a husband wants to spy on his
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:44.040]  wife or vice versa he goes and downloads the software
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:45.400]  how does this work
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:49.160]  well it's it's done a number of different formats with the uh... domestic
[1:40:49.160 --> 1:40:50.920]  relations long and i've had
[1:40:50.920 --> 1:40:54.040]  things where somebody puts uh... it kind of looks like a
[1:40:54.040 --> 1:40:56.680]  almost the size of a brick a little bit smaller but
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:40:59.880]  they'll attach that up underneath the vehicle and and it's amazing the
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:02.680]  software and the websites that help to
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:05.400]  uh... transpond that information where they drive
[1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:09.400]  uh... two places and you can literally follow them real time as they travel
[1:41:09.400 --> 1:41:13.000]  to these various locations that's a cell phone based system again
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:16.120]  uh... it it may very well be a cell phone based system
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:19.000]  wireless internet wireless right
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:22.920]  um... so that that's somewhat common in these uh... the other thing that
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:26.280]  that i've had come up a number of times is where
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:28.680]  uh... somebody has done the the pocket recorder
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:32.280]  uh... press play and record and waited for that phone call to be made or they
[1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:34.520]  waited for the visitor to come to the house and
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:38.120]  that has come up before uh... the other thing that i have and i have in my
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:39.400]  office right now
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:45.160]  um... is a small very um... uh... just an innocuous looking speaker
[1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:48.520]  with uh... just your classic black felt front
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:52.360]  which basically if you can picture this about the size of somebody using a
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:55.880]  hole punch to uh... punch a hole right in the middle of it doesn't you know it
[1:41:55.880 --> 1:41:58.440]  doesn't even stand out until you get right on top of it
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:02.680]  and inserted into that was a um... uh... a small camera
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:06.840]  and this guy was recording his wife literally for hours upon in in the
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:09.560]  house and in any place one in the bathroom and
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:12.680]  and all kinds of stuff so those are the more common
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:15.800]  um... uh... areas that that you're that you see
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:19.320]  you got many camps yeah right exactly
[1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:23.800]  um... but of course in this case you know that lady had no idea she was being
[1:42:23.800 --> 1:42:27.640]  recorded the other thing that that comes up quite frequently and it's a
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:31.960]  it's a little bit frustrating for the domestic practitioner is that
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:35.640]  people say and do all kinds of stuff on their cell phones these days
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:39.800]  um... they send text messages or they send pictures or streaming videos of
[1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:41.960]  themselves or whatever the case may be
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:45.160]  and many times they're very damning from an evidentiary standpoint
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:49.720]  and for us to try to get our hands on those can be difficult because of
[1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:54.200]  the the cellular company's reliance on some of these wiretapping laws and
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:57.560]  where you could usually issue a subpoena dukes teacum to
[1:42:57.560 --> 1:43:01.400]  get the documentation sent to your office now they want you to
[1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:04.680]  have to go through court order and they rely upon these statues which are
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:08.840]  really designed to assist the law enforcement officials and it can be
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:13.560]  very difficult to get your hands on those sorts of things
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:16.760]  so not only is there more surveillance going on but they're making it harder
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:19.880]  for the general public to get access to it
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:23.800]  that that's it that's that's exactly right all right specifically with the
[1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:28.440]  cell phones uh...
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:33.000]  a case point example of how someone is listening to
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:36.120]  their wife or listening to their neighbor or if they find out say the
[1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:41.400]  cell phone number of alex jones uh... how they would surveil that
[1:43:41.400 --> 1:43:44.520]  well you know that that piece that you probably showed earlier on your show
[1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:47.640]  where that software gets downloaded and once that happens it says if the
[1:43:47.640 --> 1:43:50.520]  person's riding around the live mic in their pocket
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:53.880]  and um... you know i have not had
[1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:58.280]  uh... either a criminal client who has been charged with
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:44:01.320]  that uh... violation of the wiretapping neither have i
[1:44:01.320 --> 1:44:04.440]  at least at this point as any of my domestic clients
[1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:07.880]  but the point is we know it's widespread sorry go ahead
[1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:10.680]  yeah no that's that's fine you're right it is widespread
[1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:15.000]  um... but as far as as uh... people in this office who who know that they have
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:19.480]  been subjected to it the discoveries that my clients have made have been the
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:21.560]  ones that i outlined to you before but
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:25.480]  you know of course we we know it's out there and you suspect that
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:29.880]  uh... you know your clients will come in a report to you listen you know he said
[1:44:29.880 --> 1:44:33.160]  x y z and the only way he'd have known that is if he would have somehow
[1:44:33.160 --> 1:44:36.360]  heard this or you know heard me say that to this person the only time i've
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:40.280]  mentioned that particular fact is when i spoke to such and such
[1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:43.320]  you know or whatever and it's a case where clearly
[1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:47.640]  the only mechanism that the person could have used to obtain that information
[1:44:47.640 --> 1:44:50.920]  was to somehow have eavesdropped on a telephone call
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:55.000]  used by the cell phone now the bigger issue here and i like to get your take
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:58.120]  on this and this is your particular area of expertise or practice but i do want
[1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:01.640]  your view on it uh... mr plumley
[1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:06.120]  and that is the federal government by law had this engineered into all phones
[1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:09.640]  and then that opened up the pandora's box for not just the nsa the fb i and
[1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:14.280]  every other alphabet agency or out of control agents within those agencies
[1:45:14.280 --> 1:45:18.440]  rogue agents to be surveilling people uh... but now this technology is out to
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:23.080]  the public and is rampantly being discovered
[1:45:23.080 --> 1:45:26.280]  you know it's interesting as the whole you know uh...
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:30.120]  i guess a balancing act between you know what's what's necessary for national
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:31.240]  security and
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:35.000]  course nine eleven has changed quite a bit of the mindset of this country
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:36.600]  probably as a whole and
[1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:40.280]  uh... everybody was uh... you know this area was big on jet noise you know
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:41.880]  uh... virginia beaches uh...
[1:45:41.880 --> 1:45:45.080]  there was a lot of stuff in the media about you know how how annoying and
[1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:47.080]  and uh... and frustrating the
[1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:50.680]  jet noise was and it was there's a diminution in in their property values
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:52.280]  in the nine eleven came in
[1:45:52.280 --> 1:45:55.560]  literally there were bumper stickers was that that said we love jet noise you
[1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:56.520]  know because
[1:45:56.520 --> 1:45:59.320]  suddenly now with the uh... our um...
[1:45:59.320 --> 1:46:03.080]  you know our country was coming to you know protect us from from all these
[1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:04.280]  things and so
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:06.680]  you know there's been obviously a shifting in the mentality over the
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:11.480]  years of of how much is too much of the big brother in going on so
[1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:14.600]  you know it's you unfortunately as technology evolves
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:17.160]  and you're going to have statutes in place which are
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:20.680]  at least in theory for national security another investigative purposes
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:22.600]  which are going to be abused
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:25.640]  and you know depending on what your focus is because
[1:46:25.640 --> 1:46:29.080]  for every one of the frustrating violations of our civil liberties that
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:30.520]  that we may see
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:31.560]  there may be
[1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:36.120]  ten areas where there was a uh... some chaos or catastrophe avoided because
[1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:38.360]  of information so it just depends on
[1:46:38.360 --> 1:46:41.320]  what perspective and what focus you want to maintain
[1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:44.280]  but we don't know that the whole nsa systems been used
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:46.920]  for the nsa center on listening to phone sex
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:51.000]  and they've had agents on tv on a bc news admitting this is going on
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:51.800]  right
[1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:54.360]  you know and you're not going to find i don't think too many people to say
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:57.160]  yeah that's that's that's cool we go ahead and do that
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:00.760]  uh... and that is obviously a violation of of your rights and
[1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:04.360]  um... you know it's very frustrating that they're they're the guys who
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:08.440]  obviously the the statutes are in the books to assist
[1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:09.640]  with certain
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:13.240]  other investigative needs and they're the ones that are abusing it now i don't
[1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:18.280]  think you're gonna find anybody to say that yeah they're okay with that
[1:47:18.280 --> 1:47:22.040]  well separately when you've been part of that uh... that particular tv production
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:26.760]  and you know when you talk to this uh... about this the media in the past
[1:47:26.760 --> 1:47:30.040]  is this shocking to your clients is this shocking
[1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:35.240]  to the public to learn uh... that so many of these platforms uh... have had
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:39.160]  surveillance backbones engineered into them i mean the feds engineered the
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:40.920]  phones by law
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:45.000]  uh... or ordered the companies to to where they can dial in
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:48.920]  or anybody else can for that matter when the phone is turned off and use it as a
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:50.200]  bugging device
[1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:52.960]  well there's certainly a of uh... a shock
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:57.320]  value that goes with the fact that i guess the shock kind of goes on
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:00.760]  two major levels and then there's obviously probably information that
[1:48:00.760 --> 1:48:02.480]  they still don't realize
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:06.440]  and then the one shock is obviously the end of one that is the most prevalent
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:07.600]  is when
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:12.920]  the person has obviously been surveilled without their knowledge and that
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:16.360]  obviously trumps everything because when it's when it's personal to you
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:21.160]  that that emotion takes over so that's the predominant one that the second one
[1:48:21.160 --> 1:48:25.800]  is that i think people continue to somehow be surprised by technology
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:29.160]  and that it has the capability to do all these things that the piece i did for
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:31.080]  the the local guys here
[1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:35.240]  was that was their focus was it was just kind of a they were all struck
[1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:39.480]  that a simple cell phone that had been left unattended for ten minutes
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:42.520]  could have been turned into such a surveillance device i don't think that
[1:48:42.520 --> 1:48:43.320]  people

[1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:43.000]  talk about just kind of about the ground legal level of dealing with all of
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:46.840]  this new emerging technology and the proliferation of surveillance systems by
[1:52:46.840 --> 1:52:51.560]  governments corporations families private individuals companies
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:56.600]  in closing sir i uh been on air for 13 years i remember about 12 years ago i
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:53:00.760]  had a time warner installer at my house and he happened to be one of their
[1:53:00.760 --> 1:53:05.240]  sub engineers he wasn't just a cable guy he was there overseeing a crew
[1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:08.680]  and he he was aware that i was you know exposing
[1:53:08.680 --> 1:53:12.520]  kind of the big brother situation and he said hey do you see this scientific
[1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:15.240]  cable box see that microphone built into it
[1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:19.000]  and he said these new digital cable boxes everything you do everything you
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:21.480]  watch is put in a psychological algorithm
[1:53:21.480 --> 1:53:25.960]  and that data can then be sold and used so i did more research on it and found
[1:53:25.960 --> 1:53:29.080]  out it was true and it was years until people started actually using those
[1:53:29.080 --> 1:53:32.680]  microphones for their own applications now all the new computers
[1:53:32.680 --> 1:53:36.280]  have cameras and microphones and two years ago google announced
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:43.000]  they said hey um we um are going to use the camera and the
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:46.760]  microphone built in on the computers with a new software to listen to everything
[1:53:46.760 --> 1:53:50.680]  going on your home or to watch you and say if we hear a dog barking we'll know
[1:53:50.680 --> 1:53:54.760]  to put ads up uh in front of you with cookies on the screen you're looking
[1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:58.200]  at for dog food and they said well we get around to
[1:53:58.200 --> 1:54:02.200]  violate in the fourth amendment because this is a computer listening which is
[1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:08.360]  asinine and then it creates a text of all the audio it's nsa type
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:11.880]  technology uh a were you aware of that and then b
[1:54:11.880 --> 1:54:15.640]  what are the legal ramifications of that no one's even discussing it
[1:54:15.640 --> 1:54:19.480]  well no i you know i guess i'm one of the uh average joes who
[1:54:19.480 --> 1:54:23.800]  finds myself kind of awestruck by the and again i don't know why
[1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:27.480]  uh but awestruck by the technology that exists that they can do
[1:54:27.480 --> 1:54:31.240]  these things with seemingly innocent pieces of equipment that
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:34.680]  have been installed in your home no i had heard
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:38.040]  that there were certain things that could happen through the cable box as
[1:54:38.040 --> 1:54:41.800]  far as video or audio surveillance and and and how
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:43.800]  that is communicated you know it's kind of like when you go to the grocery
[1:54:43.800 --> 1:54:46.280]  store and you buy one thing and all of a sudden on the back of your seat it
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:50.120]  prints out a coupon for a competing brand of
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:53.640]  of whatever it is that you just purchased um so that that kind of stuff i
[1:54:53.640 --> 1:54:57.800]  guess going on through your cable box but i think that the wire tapping laws
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:01.560]  uh and again uh in virginia address that sort of
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:05.400]  conduct you have a cox cable is a is our big provider around here but
[1:55:05.400 --> 1:55:08.680]  if you have somebody that comes in and you have any installs a box for the
[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:12.120]  for the purpose of listening in on you or surveilling you
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:17.800]  you know he's in violation it's a it's a felonious act in virginia
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:21.160]  but that's my whole point institutionalized well
[1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:24.840]  here's a case point example chicago tribune superbowl three years ago janet
[1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:29.240]  jackson wardrobe malfunction with her brass staged event
[1:55:29.240 --> 1:55:32.760]  uh and she has it all dolled up a little sun symbol
[1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:37.560]  and tivo brags we had 2.2 million rewinds and replays within 10 minutes
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:41.640]  and chicago tribune said we already knew about this people wouldn't believe us
[1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:44.520]  they said well how did you know how people reroute and replay across the
[1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:49.000]  nation well it's a two-way system and so right there
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:52.200]  i mean and i went and looked at the terms and conditions
[1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:57.000]  of the cable contract uh it doesn't say they're doing this in there so i think
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.160]  this is some serious serious lawsuits in all of this
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:05.080]  well i would not disagree with you i mean if you it's interesting that you
[1:56:05.080 --> 1:56:08.040]  went and looked at that because that's where you many times you would find
[1:56:08.040 --> 1:56:11.240]  that loophole to allow them to be able to monitor
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:14.760]  all your activity in your home is is that when they install the box and you
[1:56:14.760 --> 1:56:18.200]  agree to uh to use this within our terms and then the
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:20.840]  terms which you know you need a microscope to read
[1:56:20.840 --> 1:56:24.440]  say that you know we can we can do certain things we can listen we can watch
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:29.080]  we can record and um you know use these things to to sell
[1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:32.920]  to uh companies so they can market you uh more effectively so
[1:56:32.920 --> 1:56:37.160]  yeah you're right and without that sort of uh consent or notice being given
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:42.600]  then um you know obviously a violation all right well we appreciate your
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:46.040]  input on that in your perspective attorney eric
[1:56:46.040 --> 1:56:49.560]  plumbly uh there in virginia take care sir have a good new year thank you you

[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:42.760]  before i get to that look at this right here
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:47.080]  uh... last night i noticed uh... that
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:50.280]  the horizon milk that we had at our house
[2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:53.000]  uh... who previously had a message about how they don't have
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  bovine growth hormone or other hormones or antibiotics used on their uh cattle
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:00.040]  which are then transferred to human beings
[2:01:00.040 --> 2:01:03.960]  i noticed that it changed it said our farms produced this milk
[2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:07.800]  without antibiotics added hormones pesticides
[2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:13.480]  or cloning cloning right there uh and uh for those that uh aren't watching a
[2:01:13.480 --> 2:01:19.480]  prison planet dot tv it's a classic red and white paper
[2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:26.200]  half gallon of milk and it's the popular brand of organic
[2:01:26.200 --> 2:01:29.080]  milk that i first saw up here about eight years ago i've been using it that
[2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:33.480]  long and one of the most popular brands nationwide
[2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:36.680]  and there is the usda organic seal that they have
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:40.200]  and it says our farms produce this milk without antibiotics added
[2:01:40.200 --> 2:01:47.000]  hormones pesticides or cloning and i raised this point here because
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:50.200]  every time i talk about how their giant dairy
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:53.800]  herds especially that are from cloned animals
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:57.960]  or the offspring of cloned animals these genetic freaks with hormones to
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:02:01.320]  produce triple the amount of milk and then their genetic freaks that produce
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:05.720]  even more uh that in the cloning process uh a lot of
[2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:09.320]  other changes happen to the animal and these are cross species animals they've
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:12.760]  added insect plant genes other things into their DNA
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:16.120]  that that has a lot of spin-off effects and and alters
[2:02:16.120 --> 2:02:23.080]  uh the viral uh blooms bacterial activity in the animals
[2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:26.680]  uh and also has some connections to cancer
[2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:31.800]  many uh gmo foods of course and studies show cost cancer because it creates
[2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:36.280]  new uh well it's a whole host of things ring
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:40.520]  structures uh new types of amino acids that never existed
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:44.280]  before in cases they'll feed gmo
[2:02:44.280 --> 2:02:47.560]  potatoes to rats and you know most the rats die or they're
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:51.000]  sterile and the same thing over and over again well now it's not just soybeans
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:55.160]  or potatoes or corn it's the very animals we're eating or the milk from
[2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:58.760]  those animals that we're drinking but the public can't even address this or
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:02.520]  deal with it because they send me emails saying i'm crazy we're not eating
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:05.320]  cloned cows we're not drinking milk from cloned counts
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:09.400]  yes we are to the point of the milk companies that are organic have to tell
[2:03:09.400 --> 2:03:13.880]  you that there's no cloning comprem day so there you
[2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:17.000]  have it we are living in a buck rogers age
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:20.680]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:24.040]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[2:03:24.040 --> 2:03:27.560]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:30.840]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[2:03:30.840 --> 2:03:32.840]  dome and beg for female to take care of your
[2:03:32.840 --> 2:03:35.720]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:39.320]  elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special interest
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:42.840]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and
[2:03:42.840 --> 2:03:46.360]  email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least
[2:03:46.360 --> 2:03:49.960]  out of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:53.800]  the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[2:03:53.800 --> 2:03:57.720]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:01.240]  many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation
[2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:05.080]  the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four
[2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:08.040]  billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:10.680]  fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight
[2:04:10.680 --> 2:04:14.360]  the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:17.800]  stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:21.640]  jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in america we need to
[2:04:21.640 --> 2:04:24.760]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[2:04:24.760 --> 2:04:28.040]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:30.760]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get
[2:04:30.760 --> 2:04:34.520]  prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's

[2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:44.440]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness

[2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:41.640]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:05:41.640 --> 2:05:47.880]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:05:47.880 --> 2:05:53.880]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen rainbow govern coming up in about 22
[2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:57.160]  minutes from now
[2:05:59.640 --> 2:06:06.680]  living here in austin texas we have had four cases i can remember
[2:06:06.680 --> 2:06:11.240]  in the last few years of police shooting someone who's handcuffed
[2:06:11.240 --> 2:06:15.080]  or someone who is unarmed on the ground or uh well there are actually more than
[2:06:15.080 --> 2:06:17.960]  four cases several cases of mentally retarded
[2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:21.400]  homeless people or one guy was out of a mental institution
[2:06:21.400 --> 2:06:24.760]  and ran from the police so they gunned him down
[2:06:24.760 --> 2:06:27.640]  and there's other cases that are questionable where you'll have a mentally
[2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:31.480]  ill person waving a stick at police so they just shooting 20 feet away
[2:06:31.480 --> 2:06:35.560]  very cowardly behavior and i'm not here to bash the police
[2:06:35.560 --> 2:06:40.680]  in whole but when you have police going from being peace officers culturally to
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:44.200]  being paramilitary forces that are militarily trained
[2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:48.360]  and even trained with the military it's an us against them it's a
[2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:52.120]  no longer a guardian position and they still have that
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:54.920]  remnants of that the structural elements of that
[2:06:54.920 --> 2:06:58.840]  to a certain point but they're transferring more and more over to this
[2:06:58.840 --> 2:07:04.360]  continuum of force uh system where they've got to be in control of the
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:07.800]  situation and if somebody gets out of control in any way
[2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:11.560]  they they use you know maximum force
[2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:15.400]  against these individuals with a zero tolerance policy in the name of their
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:18.760]  safety and i've seen the statistics and numbers that hasn't made
[2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:22.360]  police safer in fact police if you're so scared of everything you should know
[2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:25.560]  the number one cause of death for you is automobile accidents
[2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:29.560]  and uh that's car wrecks but then within that group it's also hanging your
[2:07:29.560 --> 2:07:32.760]  butts out on the highway right in tickets and you guys and gals
[2:07:32.760 --> 2:07:36.840]  are got some courage i mean i know what's dangerous and uh
[2:07:36.840 --> 2:07:39.800]  that's why when i get pulled over i pull over in the grass hoping he won't or
[2:07:39.800 --> 2:07:43.240]  she won't be sticking their butt out in the middle of the highway here
[2:07:43.240 --> 2:07:46.680]  the cops get killed every day in this country getting run over
[2:07:46.680 --> 2:07:49.880]  so you're all freaking out and scared and pulling guns out on us for almost
[2:07:49.880 --> 2:07:54.280]  no reason like like you're in a war zone
[2:07:54.280 --> 2:07:57.800]  i mean i see police coming up and they pull somebody over with their hand on
[2:07:57.800 --> 2:08:02.040]  their gun to an old lady uh driving a convertible i mean
[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:05.160]  i've had a cop pull me over before and i had a weight belt in the front seat
[2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:08.120]  and he pulled his gun out and stuck it to my head and then freaked out and
[2:08:08.120 --> 2:08:15.400]  luckily didn't didn't blow up even more when he was wrong
[2:08:15.400 --> 2:08:18.600]  he said okay sorry just don't speed get out of here but
[2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:22.040]  needless to say i was had sweat running down my brow
[2:08:22.040 --> 2:08:25.320]  from five seconds of him with that gun and he said i thought it was a big knife
[2:08:25.320 --> 2:08:30.840]  scabbard or gun belt i'm just like no it's a man it's a weight belt
[2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:36.200]  it's right there but if he would have put a hole in my head
[2:08:36.200 --> 2:08:39.560]  they tell police in the academy wink wink when in the locker room and i've
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:42.200]  talked a lot of police have told me this and it's come out in court cases
[2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:45.880]  to carry a throwaway gun you know a stinger
[2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:49.880]  to carry a little uh derringer something they can throw at the scene
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:53.480]  uh that they got at a gun show or something so there's no record of it
[2:08:53.480 --> 2:08:56.760]  you know through a private sale so they can set you up and they say well we've
[2:08:56.760 --> 2:09:00.440]  got to do that because it's tough out there we're going to make mistakes and
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:02.920]  you know we've got to do this to protect our officers and it's just something
[2:09:02.920 --> 2:09:05.400]  we do see that's how the culture of corruption
[2:09:05.400 --> 2:09:07.960]  begins
[2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:12.280]  where they incrementally you know do these things in the name of the greater
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:15.480]  good but it's not
[2:09:16.280 --> 2:09:19.400]  and i'm not here to even bash the police i understand they're being federalized
[2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:23.160]  they're being brainwashed they're being slowly twisted into accepting
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:26.760]  tyranny and corruption but i am here to point out that
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:30.200]  we have the justice department's own numbers police shootings are going way
[2:09:30.200 --> 2:09:33.480]  up nationwide of citizens and more and more of those are
[2:09:33.480 --> 2:09:37.800]  questionable or outright executions remember a few years ago the famous case
[2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:43.160]  uh of the off-duty cop and the cop pulls him over says get out of the car
[2:09:43.160 --> 2:09:47.720]  and pulls his gun at him and the guy's begging saying please please please
[2:09:47.720 --> 2:09:51.480]  don't shoot me i'm not a threat and they shoot him
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:55.320]  several times was it three times and then there's the famous case of the nfl
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:58.760]  football player cops are yelling at him he's going what's wrong
[2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:02.680]  he's totally calm he's going officer officer everything's okay and he goes
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:06.280]  don't you make a fist at me he goes i'm not making a fist sir
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:08.920]  and he pulls his hands back goes like that he goes you're making a fist again
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:13.880]  so the cops start shoving him and he goes whoa whoa whoa man so they tazering
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:18.840]  and clearly he's he's supplicating he's he's he's he's okay you know this is
[2:10:18.840 --> 2:10:22.840]  international sign with their hands out open palms facing that
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:27.720]  hey no problem that's the natural hands up this is not
[2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:32.840]  the natural hands up the natural hands up is whoa whoa whoa let's you know okay
[2:10:32.840 --> 2:10:37.240]  so last friday everybody's like another police shooting in california
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:41.960]  and we have video of the bart cop execution it's up on info wars
[2:10:41.960 --> 2:10:46.200]  dot com now another video has come out
[2:10:46.200 --> 2:10:50.840]  shot further down the platform uh the first video that came out
[2:10:50.840 --> 2:10:54.440]  uh monday night was another train pulling in
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:11:01.880]  as you see the young males sitting on their hind ends
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:05.400]  up against a wall and they've got their hands in their lap
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:09.400]  and the police are yelling and screaming and freaking out and you can see
[2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:15.320]  that the young men are calm and they're they're submitting they've
[2:11:15.320 --> 2:11:19.000]  don't have their hands out extended they're going okay okay okay
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.720]  when the police are clearly saying get up turn around put you in cuffs
[2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:26.600]  so one of the guys starts getting up he puts his hands behind his back
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:29.560]  and the police decide to go ahead and slam his head down on the ground and
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:32.600]  jump on his neck a lot of people's necks get broken
[2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:36.120]  by this and the cops just make excuses so they jump on his neck they're all
[2:11:36.120 --> 2:11:38.760]  piling on him and they start going for the other guy
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:42.760]  and witnesses reported that he said hey don't hurt me i've got a young daughter
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:46.520]  hey i'm i'm i'm submitting i'm cool and you can see his face he's going
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:49.560]  come on come on everything's alright he's got his hands out like in the
[2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:53.640]  international symbol of okay okay and they grab him
[2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:57.560]  and they slam him down like the other guy and he's not resisting
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:01.640]  he's just laying there and the cop pulls his gun out aims it right at the back
[2:12:01.640 --> 2:12:05.960]  of him and shoots him in the back it goes through
[2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:09.560]  they shot him right below the neck right in the middle of the upper back
[2:12:09.560 --> 2:12:14.360]  went down into his lungs and then there's footage of the paramedics showing up
[2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:17.640]  getting him out of there saying fight fight come on hold on hold on
[2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:20.520]  and i've been there when one of my friends was dying in the hospital and we
[2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:23.800]  were all you know the doctors were saying tell him hold on tell him hold on
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:27.400]  and had to get in there and say hold on he's he still died
[2:12:27.400 --> 2:12:30.840]  that memory is just you know there i'm there with
[2:12:30.840 --> 2:12:35.720]  my parents i'm there with my childhood friend you know his mom's there his dad
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:37.960]  was driving down from Dallas 80 miles an hour
[2:12:37.960 --> 2:12:41.720]  and i watched him you know his eyes were alert and were like you know you got a
[2:12:41.720 --> 2:12:44.360]  fight you got to fight he was sort of trying to get his leg out of the bed and
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:47.480]  you could see him fighting and then he his eyes rolled back in his head after about
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:50.680]  20 minutes and then they were pumping full all these drugs just to keep him
[2:12:50.680 --> 2:12:54.520]  alive he was literally like a zombie then
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:12:57.720]  all of his you know core functions were shutting down
[2:12:57.720 --> 2:13:04.920]  and the then his dad got there and he died
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:08.600]  they took him off the respirator but he was conscious and alive on the respirator
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:10.680]  you know sitting there while i was talking to him but but i'm flashing back
[2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:13.160]  to that that's a side issue the point is
[2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:16.360]  it brought me back to that to have the paramedics and the fireman going come on
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:21.080]  fight fight fight fight and the guy was and you could see him on the gurney and
[2:13:21.080 --> 2:13:24.600]  you could see him just fighting fighting you imagine laboring not to die
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:29.960]  i mean it just it's just so horrible and so it's that humanity there and then i
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:33.320]  saw people on my comment page on info wars going out that guy shouldn't have
[2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:36.280]  been out late you know after new years to see the fireworks he
[2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:38.920]  should have been with his daughter they were dehumanizing him and saying so the
[2:13:38.920 --> 2:13:41.720]  officer made a mistake so what some eggs get broken
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:45.240]  and just that attitude and then seeing that guy fighting for his life and he
[2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:49.240]  died by the time he got to the hospital but that
[2:13:49.240 --> 2:13:54.440]  the issue is is that these barred police with the subway system in in
[2:13:54.440 --> 2:13:57.400]  san francisco and surrounding areas have done this repeatedly
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:00.840]  and i did a lot of research on this last night and printed off all these
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:04.120]  articles this big stack there's no way to go over
[2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:10.440]  all of them today but there's so many facets of this
[2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:15.160]  number one the police are saying that they believe
[2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:21.800]  that the officer had taser confusion that he thought he was pulling his
[2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:24.360]  taser well that's what the studies show
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:29.560]  that now that police are so acclimated to shooting someone with a with the
[2:14:29.560 --> 2:14:33.320]  firearm like device that fires electric
[2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:39.080]  hooks that it is habituating them to the idea of pulling
[2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:46.040]  a weapon and firing it and so in the heat of the moment which was all
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:49.880]  the police officers in a delusional mindset i mean they're freaking out
[2:14:49.880 --> 2:14:53.400]  they're yelling they're they're they're commanding the guys are okay okay
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:56.920]  they're abusing one guy jumping on him and slamming his head in the ground and
[2:14:56.920 --> 2:14:59.960]  putting their knees on his head he's submitting he turns around and goes
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:03.560]  like this and they just bam you know bring his head down and jump on him
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:06.920]  and the other guys like don't hurt me don't hurt me
[2:15:06.920 --> 2:15:11.560]  and they put him down and they pull the gun and they shoot him and let's while
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:15.320]  i'm talking without audio fast forward it and
[2:15:15.320 --> 2:15:18.520]  let's show people the shooting video they're watching
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:24.680]  on prisonplanet.tv so a there's the issue of the overreactions the police
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:28.600]  all amped up in this paramilitary idea that they're in fallujah
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:33.160]  fighting a enemy instead of being peace officers they don't have a true warriors
[2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:38.280]  restraint okay
[2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:45.160]  then there is the issue of the police lied for three days after this happened
[2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:49.400]  through monday from last friday they were saying
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:53.160]  well there was an altercation there was a tussle uh
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:57.800]  there was a disturbance going on between the officers and these guys
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:16:01.400]  and he was not restrained they were not restrained
[2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:05.080]  and that's lie number two because he was restrained they were on top of him when
[2:16:05.080 --> 2:16:07.640]  they shot him
[2:16:08.280 --> 2:16:12.360]  and they went on to say there's not any video of it the videos
[2:16:12.360 --> 2:16:18.360]  that were there at the dart station those cameras weren't recording that day
[2:16:18.360 --> 2:16:22.680]  probably a lie but then they didn't tell the public they'd confiscated
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:26.840]  two videos shot by people on the platform they're at the subway they're at the
[2:16:26.840 --> 2:16:29.880]  train station so they're lying to the public saying we
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:33.080]  don't have any videos while they have videos well
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:37.960]  thank god folks pulling up in the next train saw the altercation start that's
[2:16:37.960 --> 2:16:41.960]  the video on your screen and caught it on tape and now another video from on
[2:16:41.960 --> 2:16:46.600]  the platform not in the train also caught it from another angle
[2:16:46.600 --> 2:16:49.720]  so the issue here is the big overriding issue is
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:57.480]  the lying and deception of the police in this case which is par
[2:16:57.480 --> 2:17:02.280]  for the course it has become acceptable for them to cover their own butts
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:06.280]  even when they've committed murder or possibly manslaughter
[2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:10.600]  it may be the lesser manslaughter but they indict themselves by
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:14.280]  lying about it and trying to cover up so cameras go two ways you can

[2:21:31.400 --> 2:21:34.280]  okay let's just get right back into the transmission here
[2:21:34.280 --> 2:21:40.520]  and i see the sun shines i don't know when the videos again are all up on info wars.com and
[2:21:40.520 --> 2:21:45.880]  prisenplanet.com there's two separate videos of the shooting
[2:21:45.880 --> 2:21:49.160]  so they're not resisting they slam them down on the ground two of them
[2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:53.480]  and the police officer just pulls his hand gun out shoots the man in the back
[2:21:53.480 --> 2:22:00.680]  and gives him a lethal blow he later died at the hospital then the police say
[2:22:00.680 --> 2:22:05.160]  there's no video tapes of this the video cameras were not recording at the dart
[2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:08.280]  station then we learned they confiscate
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:11.640]  videos from people that were shooting them on cell phones but not all of them
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:16.120]  then they lie and say there are no other videos and then monday
[2:22:16.120 --> 2:22:20.120]  it breaks on the news that people did get the videos to the news
[2:22:20.120 --> 2:22:23.880]  and so then the videos are released and it shows they're lying there but now the
[2:22:23.880 --> 2:22:28.520]  media isn't finishing their job they're not pointing out
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:32.680]  that there was a lie about the fact that there were no video tapes of this
[2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:35.640]  or the police had confiscated them and were lying about that
[2:22:35.640 --> 2:22:39.160]  or the police lied and claimed there was some type of altercation
[2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:42.280]  going on between the officers and these young men
[2:22:42.280 --> 2:22:45.160]  then the story changed that they were there because of a previous altercation
[2:22:45.160 --> 2:22:48.040]  but the police had lied and made it semantically sound like the altercation
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:53.960]  was with police and the young men when the video shows they're doing nothing
[2:22:53.960 --> 2:22:59.240]  so there are just so many examples of this over and over again and we have
[2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:03.240]  the different press conferences that the dart officials and police
[2:23:03.240 --> 2:23:07.400]  have put on this is not the san francisco or oakland police
[2:23:07.400 --> 2:23:12.920]  this is the dart transit police that are all over that area
[2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:16.920]  and again they don't have really any oversight and a lot of police agencies
[2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:19.960]  are pointing that out in california because they have a bad history of this
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:22.840]  and so is the attorney general of california
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:26.840]  launched an investigation on monday when these videos came out so
[2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:31.320]  the issue here is deception and lying about this and the public needs to
[2:23:31.320 --> 2:23:36.040]  realize that lying by police agencies is the rule
[2:23:36.040 --> 2:23:41.800]  not the exception and then we have to discuss the fact of
[2:23:41.800 --> 2:23:46.760]  this guy is on paid administrative leave we don't even know the name of this
[2:23:46.760 --> 2:23:50.040]  officer he bare minimum needs to get manslaughter
[2:23:50.040 --> 2:23:52.840]  even if it wasn't intentional and he really thought it was his taser and he
[2:23:52.840 --> 2:23:56.360]  hasn't said that yet police scripts are saying it looks like he thought it was
[2:23:56.360 --> 2:23:59.080]  his taser and i tend to agree that it could be
[2:23:59.080 --> 2:24:03.720]  that because he pulls it out aims fires right into the man's
[2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:07.800]  back and then goes like that and according to witnesses we don't have
[2:24:07.800 --> 2:24:11.480]  the audio starts starts cussing going and the police are like what in the world
[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:16.200]  just happened so you have this this trigger happy
[2:24:16.200 --> 2:24:19.960]  unstable person you've got them militarized like they're fighting some
[2:24:19.960 --> 2:24:23.880]  enemy force they're no longer peace officers you've got this guy
[2:24:23.880 --> 2:24:28.760]  begging begging for them not to hurt him and so
[2:24:28.760 --> 2:24:31.080]  what do they do they kill him let's go ahead and play this clip this is the
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:33.240]  police which is a few of their lives there's a
[2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:35.960]  there's a whole bunch of these clips here it is
[2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:43.320]  we'll roll that with the bart spokesman up there speaking to everybody
[2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:47.720]  out of verbal jockeying a lot of arguing between the two groups of men
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:51.320]  at some point an officer's firearm discharged
[2:24:51.320 --> 2:24:56.360]  striking mr grant witnesses claim that bart police confronted 22 year old
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:24:59.640]  stop there grant on the fruit fail platform they
[2:24:59.640 --> 2:25:03.560]  okay so the notice how he semantically said there was
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:11.160]  verbal jockeying going on between the men at some time he's leaving it open
[2:25:11.160 --> 2:25:15.800]  the officer discharged his firearm and they go on in other clips from that
[2:25:15.800 --> 2:25:19.800]  press conference uh... you can watch the whole lengthy thing on youtube and
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:24.680]  google to go on and say that he was not restrained
[2:25:24.680 --> 2:25:27.800]  well the police were on top of it they'd slam him down
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:32.120]  holding him down when they shot him and you can watch all that on the video but
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:36.600]  the bigger issue is they lied about not having videos they said there are no
[2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:39.080]  videos and we have all these clips but if you want to go
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:41.960]  watch them on the web you can in the interest of time
[2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:45.160]  uh... we're not going to be able to play all of those because this is quite a
[2:25:45.160 --> 2:25:54.120]  bloody soap opera go ahead and play a little bit more of this clip
[2:25:54.120 --> 2:25:56.520]  and we'll uh... take him off my upper he was shot
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:26:01.800]  our preliminary investigation indicates that mr grant was not restrained
[2:26:01.800 --> 2:26:06.040]  when the officer's firearm discharged bart says several other men were cuffed
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:09.560]  and the officer's gun was out of the holster they don't know yet if the
[2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:13.240]  shooting was an accident police found no weapons among the men
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:16.760]  oscar grant was rushed to oakland's highland hospital our trauma team
[2:26:16.760 --> 2:26:19.560]  immediately took over and began working okay and
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.800]  okay now again basically everything this bart spokesman says turns out to not
[2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:27.800]  be true but notice he says well it was out of
[2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:31.480]  the holster they knew the whole time they confiscated the videos
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:35.160]  they were telling the public that they didn't have the bart videos
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:38.760]  which i don't believe for a minute so you can just go right down the line
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:41.320]  there's more and more of these clips uh...
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:44.600]  so he's out saying there was an altercation officers were there

[2:30:36.440 --> 2:30:39.400]  he was on lair news hour last night giving his take
[2:30:39.400 --> 2:30:44.040]  on barack obama's intelligence agency appointments or near appointments
[2:30:44.040 --> 2:30:48.840]  then i will spend a few minutes with him on the gaza situation
[2:30:48.840 --> 2:30:52.520]  of course rey mcgovern a cia analyst morning briefer for ronald reagan
[2:30:52.520 --> 2:30:56.040]  george bush senior and others and he's the guy who exposed the fact
[2:30:56.040 --> 2:31:01.960]  in his face about the wmd lies of former secretary
[2:31:01.960 --> 2:31:05.240]  defense rumsfeld when he was in there so he really needs no
[2:31:05.240 --> 2:31:09.080]  lengthy introduction but first sir what do you think about obama keeping
[2:31:09.080 --> 2:31:15.560]  gates on well i'm not a big favorite of gates uh...
[2:31:15.560 --> 2:31:18.920]  he worked for me at one point that back in the sixties
[2:31:18.920 --> 2:31:22.440]  early seventies and uh... i uh...
[2:31:22.440 --> 2:31:26.920]  i don't have a good opinion of him besides that he espouses policies that
[2:31:26.920 --> 2:31:31.160]  obama is at least theoretically against national missile
[2:31:31.160 --> 2:31:34.120]  defense uh... i'm putting missiles in
[2:31:34.120 --> 2:31:38.200]  the check republic in poland uh... doing uh...
[2:31:38.200 --> 2:31:42.360]  uh... you know doing other things that uh... appeal to the military industrial
[2:31:42.360 --> 2:31:43.480]  complex
[2:31:43.480 --> 2:31:47.800]  gates is a is a threat and uh... i'm afraid that the obama's made things more
[2:31:47.800 --> 2:31:50.920]  difficult for him by keeping gates on
[2:31:50.920 --> 2:31:55.400]  what about the new uh... folks that he's moving into the appointments
[2:31:55.400 --> 2:32:01.480]  well we open leon panetta uh... is an old washington hand who knows the ropes
[2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:02.840]  uh...
[2:32:02.840 --> 2:32:07.560]  he was uh... chief of staff for uh... clinton for a while he was head of the
[2:32:07.560 --> 2:32:10.280]  uh... your management budget
[2:32:10.280 --> 2:32:14.120]  he was uh... a big budget guy in the congress matter of fact people don't
[2:32:14.120 --> 2:32:18.120]  realize this but that it was one of those responsible for budget surplus
[2:32:18.120 --> 2:32:19.080]  imagine that
[2:32:19.080 --> 2:32:21.240]  you know what surplus me
[2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:24.760]  you know i in the nineties under clinton so he's a great guy
[2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:26.960]  as bright as they come more important
[2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:29.440]  he's got an impeachable integrity
[2:32:29.440 --> 2:32:33.960]  uh... and he's made a name for himself outside intelligence work
[2:32:33.960 --> 2:32:35.720]  and he's a good manager
[2:32:35.720 --> 2:32:39.840]  and those are the prerequisites for good uh... director of intelligence speak
[2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:42.040]  from some experience on this alex
[2:32:42.040 --> 2:32:45.240]  since i served under nine of them nine
[2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:47.160]  what about blare
[2:32:47.160 --> 2:32:52.040]  there is a uh... the returns are not all in on blare uh... my colleagues some of
[2:32:52.040 --> 2:32:53.760]  them work with him
[2:32:53.760 --> 2:32:57.120]  he is said to be a pretty good strategic thinker
[2:32:57.120 --> 2:32:59.640]  uh... but when you look at the how he acted
[2:32:59.640 --> 2:33:03.720]  for example when he was chief of forces in the pacific
[2:33:03.720 --> 2:33:08.320]  and the indonesian generals decided to uh... give a real bloody nose to the
[2:33:08.320 --> 2:33:10.800]  that for the indigenous people in east timor
[2:33:10.800 --> 2:33:13.400]  before timor got its independence
[2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:15.680]  well blare was supposed to restrain them
[2:33:15.680 --> 2:33:19.160]  and we supposed to go to the general say look you know stop massacring people in
[2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:22.680]  churches and doing all manner of other things like that
[2:33:22.680 --> 2:33:24.520]  and instead
[2:33:24.520 --> 2:33:27.600]  despite the instructions from the state department and from the
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:31.480]  national security council blare coddled these generals
[2:33:31.480 --> 2:33:33.800]  because he saw as his mission
[2:33:33.800 --> 2:33:38.120]  uh... the coddling of the military opposite numbers in indonesia a very
[2:33:38.120 --> 2:33:39.760]  important country
[2:33:39.760 --> 2:33:43.560]  and so that gives me pause you know that uh... really gives me great pause
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:44.600]  because
[2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:48.200]  this story is corroborated by cables that were leaked to to
[2:33:48.200 --> 2:33:49.560]  certain reporters
[2:33:49.560 --> 2:33:53.680]  cables from the state department and from the nsc saying look uh...
[2:33:53.680 --> 2:33:55.200]  i can't stop the
[2:33:55.200 --> 2:33:57.760]  uh... can't stop the atrocities
[2:33:57.760 --> 2:33:59.440]  instead of that
[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:00.800]  uh... by all accounts
[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:02.300]  there went ahead and uh...
[2:34:02.300 --> 2:34:05.000]  that told them well you know it's going to be alright will support you no matter
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:05.560]  what
[2:34:05.560 --> 2:34:07.840]  that's an old syndrome in the military
[2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:11.440]  i hope he's outgrown
[2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:16.520]  mister mcgovern in the uh... time we have left with you
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:18.520]  bottom line
[2:34:18.520 --> 2:34:19.620]  what is your
[2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:22.480]  analysis of what happened in moon by
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:25.920]  formerly bombay uh... three weeks ago four weeks ago
[2:34:25.920 --> 2:34:30.000]  just briefly and then currently what's happening in
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:31.120]  gaza
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:34.640]  with the israeli siege and encirclement
[2:34:34.640 --> 2:34:37.240]  of the three major cities there
[2:34:37.240 --> 2:34:41.920]  well i hear don't know much about one by that has been in the newspapers but i
[2:34:41.920 --> 2:34:44.840]  do know something about the problem in gaza
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:46.560]  it is unconscionable
[2:34:46.560 --> 2:34:48.920]  what the israeli forces are doing there
[2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:52.240]  they couldn't do it about the blessing of our government
[2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:53.760]  so we're all to blame
[2:34:53.760 --> 2:34:56.880]  uh... we're all responsible for these atrocities
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:34:59.160]  it is ethnic cleansing
[2:34:59.160 --> 2:35:03.480]  it is the removal to the degree they can of all the palestinians that uh...
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:05.200]  inhabit that part of the
[2:35:05.200 --> 2:35:06.200]  world
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:12.080]  it is just uh... beyond belief that uh... we as a nation would sit still
[2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:13.980]  for the bombing of civilians
[2:35:13.980 --> 2:35:17.000]  the killing of some five hundred and fifty people
[2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  and now
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:22.440]  five hundred fifty palestinians as opposed to i think less number so seven
[2:35:22.440 --> 2:35:24.880]  israeli is not the best time to send
[2:35:24.880 --> 2:35:28.920]  disproportion to you it certainly sounds disproportionate to me we have a
[2:35:28.920 --> 2:35:32.720]  high-tech military uh... that broke the ceasefire
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:36.520]  uh... in multiple ways in bombings and shutting down uh... the entrance points
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:40.440]  uh... to the gaza strip and then we have this whole center media
[2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:44.000]  that uh... hamas singularly is to blame
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:47.200]  for breaking uh... the truce
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:52.800]  you know you know what i call the affording corporate media at the fc m
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:54.040]  uh...
[2:35:54.040 --> 2:35:58.160]  cannot be uh... dependent on to give anything near an objective view on these
[2:35:58.160 --> 2:35:59.240]  things and
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:03.840]  that's really mischievous because most american people that don't have any way
[2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:05.960]  except programs like yours
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:09.400]  of knowing what really is going on there and what really is going on there is
[2:36:09.400 --> 2:36:11.720]  very much akin to what i went on
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:13.120]  that's a germany
[2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:17.200]  when the jews were on the receiving end of this kind of tracety
[2:36:17.200 --> 2:36:18.880]  and that on the delivery
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:22.640]  or or the native americans you know hitler wrote as you know serve that
[2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:25.400]  he took his concentration camp strategy
[2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:29.120]  from what happened in the in the uh... west in the united states
[2:36:29.120 --> 2:36:32.240]  uh... in the eighteen sixties and seventies and eighties and nineties
[2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:36.400]  uh... and then the israeli's uh... it's come out have actually adopted some of
[2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:38.200]  those same systems
[2:36:38.200 --> 2:36:44.120]  yeah uh... and i've heard uh... well i was in israel summer before last
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:48.400]  very prominent settler on the top of one of these gleaming hills told me look
[2:36:48.400 --> 2:36:49.760]  uh... don't uh...
[2:36:49.760 --> 2:36:53.800]  don't criticize us for what we're doing look what you do to the indians
[2:36:53.800 --> 2:36:56.080]  and i said to him look that was then
[2:36:56.080 --> 2:37:00.520]  we're sorry for that we still have to attend for that but now is now
[2:37:00.520 --> 2:37:02.360]  and when i watch
[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:05.840]  when i look at these every hillside
[2:37:05.840 --> 2:37:09.320]  topped by gleaming alabaster settlements
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:13.760]  where uh... down in in the villages below people that deprived of wells of
[2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:14.920]  running water
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:17.760]  of the uh... access to the fields
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:21.280]  you know this is really really bad alex and we have to wake up the american
[2:37:21.280 --> 2:37:23.400]  people because if they knew
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:26.680]  i still have enough faith in the american people if they knew what was
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:28.320]  really going on there
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:30.360]  uh... we would do something about it
[2:37:30.360 --> 2:37:31.520]  we would uh...
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:33.440]  pursue our congresspeople
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:37.760]  our senators to make sure that they did not give three billion dollars
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:39.680]  every year to israel to
[2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:42.240]  to perpetrate these atrocities
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:43.880]  uh... in closing
[2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:47.600]  i want to talk about how you from from past operations we see with israelis
[2:37:47.600 --> 2:37:49.160]  how this will play out
[2:37:49.160 --> 2:37:52.600]  uh... and will they turn north uh... in the leaven as as they're saying they
[2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:55.600]  may do now and try to why this is trying to blame it on iran
[2:37:55.600 --> 2:37:57.520]  right now claiming they're behind uh...
[2:37:57.520 --> 2:38:00.400]  uh... hamas we know they're behind as well but not hamas
[2:38:00.400 --> 2:38:02.280]  uh... you know that point
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:04.120]  but but first
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:07.640]  did the israelis not launch this during the interim when bush is a lame duck with
[2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:10.040]  the three weeks left at that time when they launched it
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:14.440]  and when obama isn't in yet so that there's that smokescreen and they did
[2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:17.400]  launch the attacks on christmas eve
[2:38:17.400 --> 2:38:21.160]  yeah that was part of the plan of course there's no better friend uh... so to
[2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:25.240]  speak of israel than george bush he's not going to do anything about it of
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:26.960]  course he's not even uh...
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:29.840]  permitted his folks to call for ceasefire
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:33.520]  so that was part of the other part has to do with who's the most belligerent in
[2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:35.360]  israel there's a uh...
[2:38:35.360 --> 2:38:38.440]  there's a election coming up in about six weeks
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:40.640]  it looks like net and yahoo
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:44.600]  who's uh... you know mister belligerent uh... has the edge so
[2:38:44.600 --> 2:38:46.840]  at tippy liveny and uh...
[2:38:46.840 --> 2:38:49.880]  and and barock the defense minister
[2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:54.280]  are you know trying to fit trying to appear just as uh... just as aggressive
[2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:55.360]  so you have the
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:38:58.560]  the political dynamic in both countries at work here
[2:38:58.560 --> 2:39:01.680]  and of course on the receiving end of all the stuff for the
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:04.920]  other people in gaza crammed into a very short
[2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:05.960]  area
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:08.800]  uh... one point five million of them
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:12.800]  so uh... this is going to stop uh... and if it if uh...
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:13.960]  if we do not
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:16.280]  as a restraining force
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:20.240]  and the israelis just might you know there's an eight outside chance that the
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:22.760]  israelis might feel so
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:23.880]  cuba's
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:24.800]  full
[2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:29.120]  that they would take them you know bush has almost two weeks left you know
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:31.280]  why don't we blame the urenians
[2:39:31.280 --> 2:39:33.840]  for something really big that happens to our
[2:39:33.840 --> 2:39:35.080]  our forces
[2:39:35.080 --> 2:39:39.600]  and go take out some of those sites in iran than the americans would have to be
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:43.200]  full square behind us because bush is promised to do that
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:47.200]  that's still a concern of mine i was so that's what you said here six
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:51.120]  months ago was and we're seeing this even the press that some of the neocons
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:52.200]  israel were saying
[2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:56.680]  the time to attack would be after obama was elected in between that interim
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:39:57.360]  time
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:39:58.120]  mm-hmm
[2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:01.400]  yeah i think the real sticking point here is two things
[2:40:01.400 --> 2:40:03.040]  one is that uh...
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:06.400]  admiral mollin the head of the joint chiefs probably would uh...
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:09.920]  delay for two weeks before you carry out orders like that it
[2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:12.360]  it just would be seen so crassly
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:13.880]  as uh...
[2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:17.080]  teeny bushes last gas that i doubt
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:21.920]  i doubt whether mollin afforded to do that with uh... senate's forces on
[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:23.440]  uh... on iran
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:26.000]  the other thing is that the russians
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:28.840]  after that that fracas in georgia
[2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:32.600]  uh... the russians they came to the israelis and to us and said look you
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:33.200]  know
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:34.720]  we've had it
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:35.480]  that's enough
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:37.960]  we don't want any more stuff in our backyard
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:41.840]  so don't even think don't even think of attacking iran and i think
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:43.320]  if you look at the timing
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:46.560]  early august that's when all the propaganda fell off and that's when
[2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:49.680]  the israelis and the u.s. started getting more sensible
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:51.720]  in their approach to iran
[2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:55.240]  do you think uh... in closing that uh... obama will put the missiles in
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:40:57.480]  pollin in ukraine
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:03.080]  i hope not uh... he's got gates there and gates is uh... strongly for it
[2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:07.680]  uh... you know it all depends really on how much beholden
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:09.800]  oracle bomb it is to be
[2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:13.520]  military industrial complex because that's what this is all about missile
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:17.280]  systems that won't work missile systems that can always be overcome
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:21.720]  look at ron emmanuel look at ron emmanuel i mean is that not a sign of
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:23.160]  well uh... we'll see
[2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:26.840]  uh... i'd like to think that with these last appointments in justice
[2:41:26.840 --> 2:41:29.120]  department and at the cia
[2:41:29.120 --> 2:41:32.440]  that he's getting back in balance maybe uh... when you're on next week we can
[2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:34.240]  talk about the possibility now that you've
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:37.360]  in remission from lymphoma cancer we all prayed for you
[2:41:37.360 --> 2:41:40.800]  uh... that uh... we can talk about you writing a book or something
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:44.080]  uh... because you're so respected and have had called so many things uh...
[2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:46.600]  accurately are you looking at uh...
[2:41:46.600 --> 2:41:49.360]  at writing a book is every time i have you on i wish there was something i could
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:50.720]  plug so people can

[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:18.120]  bank of england
[2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:21.160]  he's saying we're gonna have a uh... depression and a devaluation of the
[2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:23.920]  dollar in two to five years
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:27.720]  steve was in an article on that today a person one dot com before i forget
[2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:31.040]  i got a multi-test was going to all this on air unlike during the breaks and
[2:43:31.040 --> 2:43:32.960]  directing the tv show and trying to
[2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:35.360]  figure out what clips to get ready i want to say
[2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:38.120]  we've been doing these tb shows in there now for what about two weeks
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:40.560]  you guys are just getting better and better and better
[2:43:40.560 --> 2:43:42.600]  we're having to expand the control room though
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:44.800]  having three guys crammed in there that's a
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:46.800]  but a bit of a problem but uh...
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:50.240]  i need to do what i said i do two weeks ago i need to get a camera out
[2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:53.760]  they kind of give folks a tour of this studio of the control room out there
[2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:54.360]  maybe
[2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:57.360]  maybe interview you guys so people know who's behind the scenes
[2:43:57.360 --> 2:44:00.440]  well i would i could do that right now we could read one of these cameras up
[2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:01.640]  with a wireless unit
[2:44:01.640 --> 2:44:03.320]  uh... into the feed not just
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:05.240]  walk around the office that way and
[2:44:05.240 --> 2:44:08.360]  instead of so videotaping and editing it's a lot easier to do everything on the
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:09.400]  fly no no
[2:44:09.400 --> 2:44:11.920]  uh... perhaps friday we should gear up friday
[2:44:11.920 --> 2:44:15.160]  uh... for a segment during prison planet dot tv
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:17.320]  uh... to uh...
[2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:20.280]  well there we go he just rotated one of the robot cameras around
[2:44:20.280 --> 2:44:22.320]  you go ahead and punch it up with you guys in there
[2:44:22.320 --> 2:44:23.960]  uh...
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:27.240]  unfortunately that camera is right up against the glass
[2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:29.240]  there's uh... jaren right there
[2:44:29.240 --> 2:44:31.840]  he's pointing his thumb over there at uh... paul hartman
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:34.120]  a k a who's
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:35.920]  fan of the hoosiers
[2:44:35.920 --> 2:44:37.280]  over there
[2:44:37.280 --> 2:44:41.040]  and uh... there he is ladies and gentlemen
[2:44:41.040 --> 2:44:43.800]  yes we're gonna have a document can mount in the ceiling
[2:44:43.800 --> 2:44:47.240]  up behind me so it'll be able to shoot down through the glass
[2:44:47.240 --> 2:44:50.000]  uh... into uh... those guys
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:52.540]  that are in there on the show
[2:44:52.540 --> 2:44:54.680]  okay i am uh... really uh...
[2:44:54.680 --> 2:45:00.520]  babbling here ladies and gentlemen that's what i do best
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:03.440]  you know what i want to go back to the bart video go back to the uh... shooting
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:07.040]  video because i ran out of time before my government was on with us
[2:45:07.040 --> 2:45:08.560]  to cover that uh...
[2:45:08.560 --> 2:45:09.880]  now remember
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:13.320]  the police are saying here
[2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:15.040]  that
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:18.320]  they didn't have any videos and that the surveillance cameras
[2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:21.300]  in the bar facility
[2:45:21.300 --> 2:45:23.300]  there at the uh...
[2:45:23.300 --> 2:45:27.520]  train station at the train stop
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:30.680]  first one hooked into the recorders and then all they didn't get a recording
[2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:33.680]  meanwhile we find out within minutes they'd caught this is days later that
[2:45:33.680 --> 2:45:38.720]  they're saying this knowing they confiscated cell phones that video on
[2:45:38.720 --> 2:45:41.560]  but again thank god a train pulled in
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:42.800]  subway car pulled in
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:46.760]  and people were videotaping out of that and people down the platform
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:48.560]  dot video of the shooting
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:49.880]  and
[2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:53.560]  you know i said earlier the system is playing a game
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:56.360]  from ten twenty thirty forty years ago
[2:45:56.360 --> 2:45:58.400]  depending on which system they're involved in
[2:45:58.400 --> 2:46:00.200]  and so they're used to lying
[2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:04.880]  killing covering up engaging in corruption without
[2:46:04.880 --> 2:46:06.920]  our cameras pointed back at him you know this
[2:46:06.920 --> 2:46:10.160]  so so nine times out of ten it's their own cameras
[2:46:10.160 --> 2:46:12.800]  that they have to lie and claim malfunctioned or they don't have the
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:14.520]  footage in every case
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:16.040]  that's actually acting again
[2:46:16.040 --> 2:46:17.320]  acting against them
[2:46:17.320 --> 2:46:20.120]  and then it's our cameras that are built into the cell phones and everything
[2:46:20.120 --> 2:46:21.840]  they're having a problem
[2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:24.640]  that's why they want to shut down the internet and the inventor of the
[2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:28.120]  internet came out this week paul was an article on prison planet dot com it's
[2:46:28.120 --> 2:46:32.280]  there in the news in focus section i i didn't cover it should have
[2:46:32.280 --> 2:46:33.800]  about the fact
[2:46:33.800 --> 2:46:37.480]  uh... saying that the internet is dying and that's what internet to say they
[2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:39.280]  would do five years ago they said we're gonna
[2:46:39.280 --> 2:46:42.680]  not upgrade the old web we're not gonna build new homes were not we're gonna let
[2:46:42.680 --> 2:46:43.600]  it fail
[2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:46.840]  and shut it down through getting rid of net neutrality in taxes and regulations
[2:46:46.840 --> 2:46:48.880]  and filters and controls
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:50.880]  we're gonna force you over internet to
[2:46:50.880 --> 2:46:53.160]  where no one has an individual website
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:56.280]  but select corporations they say fifty universities
[2:46:56.280 --> 2:46:58.200]  fifty select corporations
[2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:01.160]  and fat and and and government agencies
[2:47:01.160 --> 2:47:05.320]  and so they'll say sorry you don't get a sub page on the new myspace internet to
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:07.000]  you don't get a sub page on the new
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:08.480]  you to the internet to
[2:47:08.480 --> 2:47:12.080]  or you sign agreement when you know when the terms of service when you click
[2:47:12.080 --> 2:47:16.040]  and you register saying they can erase you they can delete you they can restrict
[2:47:16.040 --> 2:47:16.720]  you
[2:47:16.720 --> 2:47:18.120]  so
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:21.280]  uh... this is the larger program but go ahead and punch that video back up and
[2:47:21.280 --> 2:47:23.720]  just go ahead and roll out to break
[2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:26.840]  uh... the audio of the shooting go ahead here it is
[2:47:26.840 --> 2:47:31.000]  go taken from the bar train recorded on the cell phone by a passenger who
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:33.040]  doesn't want to be identified
[2:47:33.040 --> 2:47:37.360]  you can see twenty two-year-old oscar grant on his knees talking to police
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:40.000]  he is pulled onto the ground face down
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:43.680]  then after what appears to be a struggle a bar officer with his knee to grant
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:44.800]  neck and head
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:48.480]  and another officer stop right there stop right there stop right there every
[2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:52.600]  time i see police jump on somebody and beat them up for no reason
[2:47:52.600 --> 2:47:54.600]  they call it a tussle or a struggle
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:56.520]  the guy has his hands like this
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:00.000]  they grab him they put him down he's doing nothing they jump on him you see
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:01.840]  his body flinch

[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:06.160]  pound body
[2:48:06.160 --> 2:48:13.360]  how dare you flinch in pain that's it i'm gonna taser you but he pulls a gun
[2:48:13.360 --> 2:48:16.040]  and shoots him in at the back
[2:48:16.040 --> 2:48:19.000]  so notice the media even what appears to be a tussle
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:23.160]  they'll probably say he deserved to die next ah well he attacked the officers he's dead

[2:52:41.880 --> 2:52:44.400]  with the swat team cops tackling me
[2:52:44.400 --> 2:52:49.800]  in scene after scene with keanu reeves

[2:53:21.280 --> 2:53:23.000]  we now have two replacements

[2:53:28.880 --> 2:53:32.400]  been through the wars and is in the film a scanner darkly

[2:53:35.080 --> 2:53:39.160]  that's nothing that's nothing it's gonna cost another hundred grand to finish

[2:58:37.920 --> 2:58:40.040]  to answer the questions
[2:58:40.040 --> 2:58:43.360]  uh... i was eight years a narcotics officer
[2:58:43.360 --> 2:58:46.520]  uh... in west texas and east texas
[2:58:46.520 --> 2:58:50.840]  my bosses in recent interviews called me one of the top narcotics officers in
[2:58:50.840 --> 2:58:52.200]  the nation
[2:58:52.200 --> 2:58:55.880]  i don't believe that but i'll take that if that's what i need to get people to
[2:58:55.880 --> 2:58:57.040]  listen
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:59:02.040]  uh... i was involved in over uh... one hundred search warrants
[2:59:02.040 --> 2:59:05.120]  i personally arrested over eight hundred people
[2:59:05.120 --> 2:59:06.600]  for drugs
[2:59:06.600 --> 2:59:09.760]  i seized numerous autos and
[2:59:09.760 --> 2:59:12.200]  hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash
[2:59:12.200 --> 2:59:16.200]  i worked joint operations with the f b i the d e a
[2:59:16.200 --> 2:59:19.280]  u s border patrol in u s military
[2:59:19.280 --> 2:59:23.880]  there's not any part of the the drug scene in america that i didn't see
[2:59:23.880 --> 2:59:26.480]  i got disillusioned with the drug war
[2:59:26.480 --> 2:59:28.160]  and years later
[2:59:28.160 --> 2:59:29.360]  i uh...
[2:59:29.360 --> 2:59:30.640]  i realized
[2:59:30.640 --> 2:59:33.400]  that the harms the drug war was causing
[2:59:33.400 --> 2:59:36.240]  was more harm than the drugs themselves
[2:59:36.240 --> 2:59:40.040]  and i was involved in some of the corruption and i did what every man's
[2:59:40.040 --> 2:59:41.640]  supposed to do
[2:59:41.640 --> 2:59:45.560]  that's to fix your errors so i released these two videos
[2:59:45.560 --> 2:59:47.920]  uh... two years ago i released one
[2:59:47.920 --> 2:59:49.880]  last year we released the other one
[2:59:49.880 --> 2:59:52.280]  and i teach all the secrets
[2:59:52.280 --> 2:59:54.480]  that our government taught me
[2:59:54.480 --> 2:59:57.320]  how to put good citizens in a cage
[2:59:57.320 --> 2:59:59.640]  and i teach how to counter
[2:59:59.640 --> 3:00:04.720]  those uh... those measures that they use against citizens
[3:00:04.720 --> 3:00:09.560]  coming off the success of that candy and i were in one of our c e o board
[3:00:09.560 --> 3:00:11.760]  meetings which consists of us
[3:00:11.760 --> 3:00:14.440]  in our bedroom pillow talking
[3:00:14.440 --> 3:00:16.440]  and uh... candy said
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:18.560]  you know actually i was i was crying
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:21.640]  because of all the lives i had ruined and i've got a nice family i've got
[3:00:21.640 --> 3:00:24.040]  four kids sixteen-year-old daughter starts
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:26.040]  austin community college
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:30.200]  uh... so we're big on family and education you're an austinite yes yes we
[3:00:30.200 --> 3:00:31.880]  just moved to austin
[3:00:31.880 --> 3:00:33.320]  uh... five months ago
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:34.760]  yeah to launch
[3:00:34.760 --> 3:00:38.240]  cop busters and you worked in texas before in your career
[3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:40.200]  yes sir out in odessa
[3:00:40.200 --> 3:00:42.840]  texas well let's let's first get into
[3:00:42.840 --> 3:00:46.000]  how you got disillusioned how you woke up to what's happening there's the
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:48.840]  there's the basic facts out there
[3:00:48.840 --> 3:00:51.360]  uh... for folks to be aware of that
[3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:54.200]  the drug war just gets bigger and bigger and more drugs are on the streets
[3:00:54.200 --> 3:00:57.320]  and we've gone from less than a million in prison to over four million in
[3:00:57.320 --> 3:01:01.440]  prison and millions on parole it just gets worse and worse and worse
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:05.360]  that's right even the d e a will admit that we have more people in jail than
[3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:07.200]  ever before for drugs
[3:01:07.200 --> 3:01:09.600]  yet we have more drugs on the street
[3:01:09.600 --> 3:01:13.120]  that are more potent than ever before at a cheaper price
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:15.200]  so the drug war has failed
[3:01:15.200 --> 3:01:16.920]  to the tune of
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:20.440]  placing good human beings millions in a cage
[3:01:20.440 --> 3:01:22.720]  you know every thirty eight seconds
[3:01:22.720 --> 3:01:27.400]  somebody in america gets placed in a cage for pot crimes
[3:01:27.400 --> 3:01:32.080]  so we're fighting that and uh... we wanted to expose the corruption in the drug
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:35.440]  war because our email box stayed slammed
[3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:39.560]  with people saying please help me there are corrupt cops in my town
[3:01:39.560 --> 3:01:43.760]  so uh... candy said honey why don't you you know you're good at busting citizens
[3:01:43.760 --> 3:01:47.920]  why don't you start stinging the cops so it's her idea yes her idea
[3:01:47.920 --> 3:01:52.280]  six months later we had our first cop stung in odessa we set a trap for them
[3:01:52.280 --> 3:01:53.320]  and it worked
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:57.200]  i want to come back in a long segment and and talk more about those things and
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:01:59.640]  one recently that made international news
[3:01:59.640 --> 3:02:01.520]  that you ran and how you did those i mean
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:03.720]  i should have had you in here for two or three hours but the good news is you
[3:02:03.720 --> 3:02:04.880]  live in austin
[3:02:04.880 --> 3:02:08.040]  and so i'd like to have you in every month or so to give us reports on the
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:09.480]  latest stuff you're doing
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:11.600]  uh... because this is just so exciting
[3:02:11.600 --> 3:02:15.840]  and uh... we can spend ten hours just all the riveting stories of
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:18.520]  of these things that you've run and of course the films
[3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:21.440]  that you've made about it and how the public can protect themselves under
[3:02:21.440 --> 3:02:22.880]  the bill of rights and constitution
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:25.240]  stay with us
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:28.840]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[3:02:28.840 --> 3:02:32.080]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:35.640]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:39.400]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the superdome and
[3:02:39.400 --> 3:02:43.640]  beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare
[3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:46.840]  our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:49.480]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it
[3:02:49.480 --> 3:02:52.840]  they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and
[3:02:52.840 --> 3:02:56.520]  fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:03:00.520]  america and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:04.280]  will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities
[3:03:04.280 --> 3:03:08.760]  particularly food beyond many americans reach in pre-nazi germany super
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:11.080]  inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:14.280]  every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[3:03:14.280 --> 3:03:18.200]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:21.080]  in sight the private banks merging with our government
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:24.440]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:27.720]  the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:31.080]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready
[3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:34.680]  everything is zeroing in on food one third of americans have to choose between
[3:03:34.680 --> 3:03:38.680]  buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:42.440]  get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:45.000]  it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:48.600]  storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:52.520]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[3:03:52.520 --> 3:03:55.800]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:03:59.480]  you know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from

[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:42.440]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:45.880]  and the gcn radio network
[3:04:45.880 --> 3:05:02.280]  very cooper never get busted dot com caught busters and his wife who is part
[3:05:02.280 --> 3:05:07.000]  of the dynamic duo candy again at the time we have start
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:10.520]  go back to why you were crying why you were upset why you were feeling bad
[3:05:10.520 --> 3:05:14.280]  about what you were involved with what that basic corruption was and then boil
[3:05:14.280 --> 3:05:18.040]  down some of those stings i was upset and crying
[3:05:18.040 --> 3:05:23.080]  because i've got four kids that i see every day and we're big on family and
[3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:28.600]  then i remember the look of kids on these
[3:05:28.600 --> 3:05:32.280]  raids that i was involved in kicking in doors at three o'clock in the morning
[3:05:32.280 --> 3:05:36.200]  after throwing in a flash grenade and mom and dad screaming and we're
[3:05:36.200 --> 3:05:39.960]  screwing pistols into their ears and the kids are screaming and then we haul
[3:05:39.960 --> 3:05:44.920]  the kids off to department of human services and i remember those kids
[3:05:44.920 --> 3:05:47.880]  crying and then uh you know that didn't go away
[3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:52.360]  just because i left that house that person's marked forever with that terror
[3:05:52.360 --> 3:05:56.680]  and i i was on the other end of a civil raid
[3:05:56.680 --> 3:06:00.200]  and i remember the terrorizing effect that had on my kids
[3:06:00.200 --> 3:06:04.680]  so i kind of got a taste of my own medicine and uh candy
[3:06:04.680 --> 3:06:07.400]  you know i was drinking a lot of vodka then like
[3:06:07.400 --> 3:06:10.920]  you know most guppy business type guys do
[3:06:10.920 --> 3:06:14.520]  and but i was drinking too much and she would come out with a
[3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:18.120]  bring me pot and say here smoke this and i would smoke that
[3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:21.720]  and not want the alcohol any longer and that's why a lot of officers just
[3:06:21.720 --> 3:06:23.960]  interrupt end up being alcoholics the highest
[3:06:23.960 --> 3:06:29.160]  statistic in that profession uh because it is a stressful crazy job
[3:06:29.160 --> 3:06:32.760]  yeah it's horrible but that's not an excuse either you know but
[3:06:32.760 --> 3:06:36.920]  but my point is candy helped me get off the alcohol and i started smoking pot
[3:06:36.920 --> 3:06:40.440]  so marijuana helped you help me it it does something to
[3:06:40.440 --> 3:06:45.240]  for me it made me a more compassionate person and i stopped and slowed down long
[3:06:45.240 --> 3:06:48.920]  enough to realize the harms that i was creating on this earth
[3:06:48.920 --> 3:06:53.160]  instead of helping plus he was much nicer when he smoked
[3:06:53.160 --> 3:06:59.160]  yeah yeah so i married my pot dealer yeah pretty much
[3:06:59.160 --> 3:07:03.400]  and then i i got on the internet and i started reading the statistics and what
[3:07:03.400 --> 3:07:06.680]  was really happening with this drug war and i started remembering
[3:07:06.680 --> 3:07:10.680]  back to the corruption i was involved in planning drugs on people
[3:07:10.680 --> 3:07:14.520]  lying on search warrants and that's stealing now that's standard now i mean
[3:07:14.520 --> 3:07:18.440]  not just truly a texas planning cocaine on 50 plus black people
[3:07:18.440 --> 3:07:21.480]  not just houston framing more than 4 000 people
[3:07:21.480 --> 3:07:25.080]  houston chronicle not just the fbi crime lab saying it was standard just to
[3:07:25.080 --> 3:07:29.240]  frame everybody i mean this is this is the norm not the exception
[3:07:29.240 --> 3:07:32.920]  that's exactly right you know how do they induct you into that
[3:07:32.920 --> 3:07:37.880]  i believed what i was doing was right when i was planning the drugs and lying
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:42.200]  on search warrants um because my parents raised me anybody
[3:07:42.200 --> 3:07:47.080]  that does drugs is evil and the school reinforced that when i went to school
[3:07:47.080 --> 3:07:50.360]  with their program but it's okay to drink vodka or take prozac
[3:07:50.360 --> 3:07:53.800]  it's not it's better to smoke pot exactly i'm saying they push all these
[3:07:53.800 --> 3:07:57.880]  really dangerous drugs but then go after marijuana because that's 86 percent
[3:07:57.880 --> 3:08:01.080]  of people that use drugs only use that without that their drug war is over but
[3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:04.600]  go ahead that's right you're exactly right and the church reinforced it you
[3:08:04.600 --> 3:08:08.440]  know went to church and and so by the time i was a young man and the
[3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:11.960]  government got ahold of me and the police academy
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:17.480]  they even reinforced those beliefs more so i believed the i was serving the
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:21.000]  greater good i didn't realize that breaking constitutional law
[3:08:21.000 --> 3:08:24.520]  and taking freedoms away from people was causing more harm
[3:08:24.520 --> 3:08:29.160]  i really believed at the time that all the corruption i was involved in
[3:08:29.160 --> 3:08:33.880]  was helping uh helping the the movement and that was to get drugs out of
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:37.000]  america ronald reagan was one of my heroes
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:40.520]  you know kevin booth i sell his film the drug war film
[3:08:40.520 --> 3:08:44.600]  that proves ronald reagan was involved in the in smuggling the cocaine
[3:08:44.600 --> 3:08:48.280]  you know i was arresting people with ronald reagan cracking their pockets
[3:08:48.280 --> 3:08:52.280]  and it's just kind of the the oz the oz
[3:08:52.280 --> 3:08:57.080]  screen fell and what i thought was this big powerful american voice turned out
[3:08:57.080 --> 3:09:03.560]  to be a little bald headed tiny man that well you know the british 160 years ago
[3:09:03.560 --> 3:09:07.560]  used opium importation to take control of china instead of a police state
[3:09:07.560 --> 3:09:11.080]  and then overthrow it so this is really a formula to bring down a nation as a
[3:09:11.080 --> 3:09:13.880]  pretext to bring in the military which they now use in drug
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:16.520]  interdiction inside the country well it's worked
[3:09:16.520 --> 3:09:19.800]  look where our country is right now they they're successful
[3:09:19.800 --> 3:09:26.280]  at scaring the american people um and hopefully our efforts will will help
[3:09:26.280 --> 3:09:29.960]  fix some of that by exposing these cops on camera
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:33.080]  absolutely you know what if you guys don't have somewhere to go
[3:09:33.080 --> 3:09:36.920]  in 45 minutes we're live on the radio the shortwave everywhere but we'll be
[3:09:36.920 --> 3:09:40.760]  just prison planet dot tv and internet but then that gets ripped to the web and
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:44.440]  millions see it in the aggregate maybe we can do 15 20 minutes into overdrive
[3:09:44.440 --> 3:09:46.440]  so we have plenty of time to cover all this and
[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:49.480]  play some video clips from your film we'd love to stay we're honored
[3:09:49.480 --> 3:09:52.520]  okay well i mean i thought you lived in north texas i'm glad to hear you're in

[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:22.120]  up in a helicopter over pot fields what was that
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:25.960]  well candy uh is our public relations manager
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:31.400]  and she got a call actually two days before she got the call from channel
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:35.000]  33 news we were pillow talking having another one of our meetings
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:38.920]  and i said our second film never get rated we got to teach people how to grow
[3:10:38.920 --> 3:10:42.920]  pot and sell pot and not get busted you know
[3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:45.880]  liquor dealers are allowed to sell theirs and they don't get rated at three in
[3:10:45.880 --> 3:10:49.000]  the morning i said well though the most expensive part of this
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:52.520]  project will be to raise the money to get rent a helicopter
[3:10:52.520 --> 3:10:55.880]  because i have certificate from the dea they taught me how to fly around spot
[3:10:55.880 --> 3:11:00.120]  marijuana fields and i was going to fly around find a real clandestine
[3:11:00.120 --> 3:11:04.440]  marijuana fields sneak the film crew crew in and explain what the growers
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:07.800]  did wrong from the ground for me to spot it from the air
[3:11:07.800 --> 3:11:11.480]  two days later channel 33 from dallas called candy and said
[3:11:11.480 --> 3:11:15.000]  you know the dea just busted seven huge marijuana fields
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:18.840]  on dallas city property and they're two miles through the woods
[3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:21.960]  no reporters will go into the fields do you think barry would go up in a
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:26.120]  helicopter with us we find the fields and sneak them in
[3:11:26.120 --> 3:11:30.600]  you know sneak us in for an interview candy said well of course yeah
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:35.800]  how you're right back and um so within a week we were in the
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:39.880]  helicopter i snuck the candy and i snuck the film crew in they got
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:44.120]  their interview for channel 33 and then i remembered where the patch
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:46.840]  was from the air so when we were finished with
[3:11:46.840 --> 3:11:51.640]  that we snuck our film crew back in and that's where i give the instructions
[3:11:51.640 --> 3:11:55.080]  that you see right now on how not to get busted for growing pot
[3:11:55.080 --> 3:11:59.080]  and that was a field the dea had busted a week before
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:01.880]  amazing and the film's just full of stuff like that
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:06.520]  um how do police officers that are still narcotics officers how do they
[3:12:06.520 --> 3:12:09.880]  on average respond to you i know there's thousands and thousands of police that
[3:12:09.880 --> 3:12:14.440]  have joined an organization uh that is uh you know former narcotics officers
[3:12:14.440 --> 3:12:17.960]  against prohibition yes leap leap dot cc law
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:23.640]  enforcement against prohibition 6500 politicians judges and police
[3:12:23.640 --> 3:12:27.960]  are saying the same thing to end the drug war to answer your question
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:32.440]  we get death threats from police usually through emails
[3:12:32.440 --> 3:12:35.800]  and i've kept those you know filed away safely but
[3:12:35.800 --> 3:12:39.800]  they've they've emailed us horrible things such as i hope
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:44.360]  candy uh gets raped while you're in prison
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:12:48.920]  for releasing those films and i'll see you on the shoulder if you ever come
[3:12:48.920 --> 3:12:53.480]  through my jurisdiction so they're not happy about it and which is
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:56.440]  unfortunate because subconsciously they have a lot of guilt
[3:12:56.440 --> 3:12:59.880]  and so they need to keep the facade going of what they've done when it's
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:03.560]  a cia aircraft last year crashed with three and a half tons of pure cocaine
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:07.400]  meaning coming from source folks uh they're caught all the time
[3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:10.600]  shipping they ship the majority of the drugs in the drug war internationally
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:13.320]  is only against cowboys that don't launder their money with them the
[3:13:13.320 --> 3:13:16.920]  head of the new york stock exchange back in 99 flew
[3:13:16.920 --> 3:13:20.120]  to columbia and met on tv with the head of the
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:24.040]  fark and said invest your drug money with us or we're gonna invade your
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:26.520]  country there's an international loophole where drug
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:30.120]  money internationally is allowed to be invested in u.s banks
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:33.800]  that that's how open their drug dealing is they ship it in
[3:13:33.800 --> 3:13:37.080]  but that isn't enough to keep any legal so they get big profits
[3:13:37.080 --> 3:13:39.800]  then they get all the incredible profits on the ground
[3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:43.160]  in the name of fighting the drugs and police you can't deny that anymore
[3:13:43.160 --> 3:13:46.760]  i mean it's been an esquire magazine it's been on abc news i mean it's on
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:49.880]  record that the majority of narcotics are shipped in here by the federal
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:52.520]  government that's right and we spend 90 billion
[3:13:52.520 --> 3:13:56.600]  dollars a year now in this war on drugs and they still
[3:13:56.600 --> 3:14:00.520]  are using the propaganda to make us believe that this country will go crazy
[3:14:00.520 --> 3:14:03.640]  if we legalize the drugs when the truth is
[3:14:03.640 --> 3:14:09.960]  we give millions of citizens every day doses of heroin in the form of oxy
[3:14:09.960 --> 3:14:13.880]  cotton and uh hydrocodone we give millions of
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:18.280]  citizens doses of methamphetamine every day mostly to kids
[3:14:18.280 --> 3:14:21.800]  in the form of ritalin and adder all the way and they're not burglarizing
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:26.520]  a million people that just came out in 2008 100 million people are now on
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:31.480]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors or prozac class alone 100 million on the
[3:14:31.480 --> 3:14:34.520]  insert of that drug it says it's in the hallucinogen
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:38.680]  psychotropic class and puts you into a dream state and is highly toxic to the
[3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:41.080]  brain and body and creates psychotic breaks
[3:14:41.080 --> 3:14:45.240]  suicidal tendencies it's all in the literature that comes with the drug
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:49.240]  meanwhile no one dies of marijuana that's right and by the way folks i'm not
[3:14:49.240 --> 3:14:52.360]  some marijuana person i don't like it makes me paranoid
[3:14:52.360 --> 3:14:56.440]  it's just not what i'm into i like a budweiser i don't even do that
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:15:01.080]  now at least most of the time i try not to i'm not a pot guy and i'm telling you
[3:15:01.080 --> 3:15:05.320]  george washington smoked it and until the 30s you could walk into any drug
[3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:11.640]  store and by heroin by opiates by speed by cocaine coca-cola had cocaine in it
[3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:15.400]  and we had about one tenth and you could go look at the statistics of americans
[3:15:15.400 --> 3:15:19.160]  using those drugs that are now by making it illegal it makes it taboo
[3:15:19.160 --> 3:15:22.840]  makes it profitable in just like alcoholism tripled
[3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:26.920]  under the 10 years of prohibition back in the 20s and energized the mafia
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:31.640]  corrupted the police the very same drug dealers scullin bones is run by the
[3:15:31.640 --> 3:15:34.840]  british disney company that's mainline news founded by
[3:15:34.840 --> 3:15:38.840]  that company that had the world opium monopoly by the 20s they'd lost their
[3:15:38.840 --> 3:15:42.600]  world monopoly and the papers are now declassified they lobbied
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:46.040]  to make drugs illegal so they could jack up the price
[3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:49.320]  several thousand percentage points and then use it to corrupt police
[3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:53.720]  on top of their profits because they'd done that again
[3:15:53.720 --> 3:15:57.800]  then 80 years before in china and i know i keep going back to that
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:16:01.080]  this is a program it is and it's sad because

[3:22:47.640 --> 3:22:51.880]  over to the department he met with yolanda planted drugs on yolanda
[3:22:51.880 --> 3:22:55.240]  and then officer travel followed her to her next stop
[3:22:55.240 --> 3:22:58.120]  aversons and then had the police officers pull her over and then aversons
[3:22:58.120 --> 3:23:01.080]  parking lot and that's where she was arrested he testified that they told
[3:23:01.080 --> 3:23:05.480]  him to make sure she takes this bag when we call them
[3:23:05.480 --> 3:23:09.160]  trying to find out what we could do about all this injustice
[3:23:09.160 --> 3:23:13.160]  he's told us me and my mother he said the police
[3:23:13.160 --> 3:23:16.520]  got the wrong person they thought she was somebody else
[3:23:16.520 --> 3:23:21.080]  but once they made the bus they had to go through with it
[3:23:21.080 --> 3:23:24.760]  i mean once you plant drugs you can't say oh excuse me we planted drugs
[3:23:24.760 --> 3:23:28.920]  i reached out to barissa look i told him all the predicaments that we was in
[3:23:28.920 --> 3:23:33.240]  mr madden and i the case yolanda madden and things that were going on
[3:23:33.240 --> 3:23:36.600]  and i told him there has to be some type of program
[3:23:36.600 --> 3:23:40.120]  some type of entity out there that can come in
[3:23:40.120 --> 3:23:43.960]  and investigate these officers basically i've you know i've gone through the
[3:23:43.960 --> 3:23:47.480]  system so what so what i had to do is i reached out to cop
[3:23:47.480 --> 3:23:52.760]  busters candy and i my wife brought a team of
[3:23:52.760 --> 3:23:56.760]  detectives into odessa
[3:23:58.600 --> 3:24:05.720]  to set a trap to bust crooked cops in odessa that planted
[3:24:05.720 --> 3:24:11.800]  drugs on his daughter yolanda madden and she is now serving an eight-year prison
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:15.560]  sentence
[3:24:15.560 --> 3:24:19.720]  our attorney was inside they handcuffed our attorney
[3:24:19.720 --> 3:24:23.560]  and then when they realized nothing was illegal when they had messed up
[3:24:23.560 --> 3:24:26.840]  they released our attorney
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:36.840]  well i'm doing this for the attention of that girl that's in prison
[3:24:36.840 --> 3:24:41.720]  and the million non-violent drug prisoners we have in prison right now
[3:24:41.720 --> 3:24:45.000]  so
[3:24:48.760 --> 3:24:52.520]  unbelievable ladies and gentlemen and and the police with big smirks on their
[3:24:52.520 --> 3:24:56.680]  faces caught red-handed trying to engage in these
[3:24:56.680 --> 3:25:00.920]  activities it is the norm to plant drugs and more and more with
[3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:04.360]  hidden cameras people are catching police at roadside checkpoints you name it
[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:07.080]  how do they morally get to the point where they think it's good to send
[3:25:07.080 --> 3:25:11.240]  somebody away for five ten twenty years unlike the case in tulia
[3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:15.240]  texas where they just planted drugs on 50-something black people most of no
[3:25:15.240 --> 3:25:18.360]  criminal record and then send them away to prison feeling good i mean that's
[3:25:18.360 --> 3:25:22.440]  evil i don't have an answer for it except it is evil
[3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:26.840]  and i was part of that corruption and like i said earlier i believed what i
[3:25:26.840 --> 3:25:30.920]  was doing was right but i was a young kid and it doesn't take
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:35.560]  much maturity and much research to learn that all that's wrong and
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:39.000]  all the cops doing the drug war should should switch like i did we're about to
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:42.360]  break but what was the first time that that you were an narcotics officer and
[3:25:42.360 --> 3:25:45.960]  suddenly said this is how we do it i mean do they teach planting drugs in the
[3:25:45.960 --> 3:25:49.960]  in the uh academy courses they don't teach that in the academy but when you
[3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:53.800]  get on the street with the training partner if he
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:56.600]  senses that he can trust you and you're one of them
[3:25:56.600 --> 3:25:59.400]  then they start showing those inside ropes that
[3:25:59.400 --> 3:26:04.040]  that uh of course they don't announce and it's a sick gang mentality culture
[3:26:04.040 --> 3:26:07.000]  it's sick what they're doing but it's oh it's a brotherhood just like the east
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:11.160]  side vatos have the sick code so do the police i want to ask when we come back
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:14.760]  what percentage of units that you worked in and around
[3:26:14.760 --> 3:26:18.520]  are planting drugs on people i would guess it's the majority
[3:26:18.520 --> 3:26:23.400]  stay with us ladies and gentlemen long segment coming up right here on gcn

[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:44.600]  acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise

[3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:04.040]  life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot
[3:29:04.040 --> 3:29:07.800]  exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too
[3:29:07.800 --> 3:29:10.760]  much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it

[3:29:53.480 --> 3:29:57.480]  television show we've been doing this for two weeks now in the new studio
[3:29:57.480 --> 3:30:01.080]  about eight months total and again the good news for all the viewers out there
[3:30:01.080 --> 3:30:04.680]  is it's having an effect these tv programs on youtube every week alone
[3:30:04.680 --> 3:30:07.000]  from a few channels we're looking the numbers on
[3:30:07.000 --> 3:30:10.520]  over a million people tuning in and watching it
[3:30:10.520 --> 3:30:13.400]  so that is something added to the two million
[3:30:13.400 --> 3:30:19.080]  radio listeners per show and then just everything else and the reason i keep
[3:30:19.080 --> 3:30:23.160]  plugging that is this is exciting because we're exponentially growing and
[3:30:23.160 --> 3:30:26.200]  reaching new people with this information and then
[3:30:26.200 --> 3:30:29.400]  meeting and finding new folks that have just done so many other
[3:30:29.400 --> 3:30:32.680]  incredible things you know i guess i'm a guy after your heart your guy from my
[3:30:32.680 --> 3:30:35.400]  heart because these stains these exposing things i've done these on the
[3:30:35.400 --> 3:30:38.680]  military i've done these on world leaders with satanic
[3:30:38.680 --> 3:30:43.000]  activities with the bohemian grove which is an offshoot of skull and bones
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:45.720]  and then i've seen one of your films now to be
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:49.560]  just today seeing all this other footage it's amazing now now let's finish up
[3:30:49.560 --> 3:30:52.840]  with how this planting drugs works answering the question
[3:30:52.840 --> 3:30:56.440]  of what percentage of police departments and units you believe
[3:30:56.440 --> 3:31:00.920]  are planting drugs and then let's get into uh this latest sting you ran
[3:31:00.920 --> 3:31:06.120]  that made international headlines 85 percent are planting drugs would be my
[3:31:06.120 --> 3:31:10.360]  guess and i'm probably under guessing and the public
[3:31:10.360 --> 3:31:13.560]  has no idea this just unbelievable systemic corruption
[3:31:13.560 --> 3:31:18.920]  the public knows but for some reason like my parents and grandparents trusted
[3:31:18.920 --> 3:31:23.080]  politicians to protect our freedoms it seems like the younger generation have
[3:31:23.080 --> 3:31:28.520]  realized it's up to the citizenry to get our freedoms back
[3:31:28.520 --> 3:31:32.200]  now going back to the department where were you where were you working i mean
[3:31:32.200 --> 3:31:34.840]  did you immediately as an officer become a narcotics officer how did that
[3:31:34.840 --> 3:31:39.080]  happen and then what was the first time they said let's plant drugs
[3:31:39.080 --> 3:31:43.400]  i basically overwhelmed law enforcement pretty fast
[3:31:43.400 --> 3:31:48.040]  i climbed in the first year i was already already had my own drug dog that i was
[3:31:48.040 --> 3:31:51.240]  training for narcotics and where was that
[3:31:51.240 --> 3:31:56.440]  that was a big sandy police department i made over 100 drug arrests
[3:31:56.440 --> 3:32:00.120]  in a year and a half on only five miles of highway
[3:32:00.120 --> 3:32:04.200]  with my new drug dog and that's what got the attention of the permian basin
[3:32:04.200 --> 3:32:10.360]  drug task force out in west texas uh they went under the tncp program texas
[3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:13.800]  narcotics control program and it was there at the permian
[3:32:13.800 --> 3:32:18.440]  basin drug task force where i learned to do all of these corrupt things
[3:32:18.440 --> 3:32:22.760]  and give us a case point example um probably
[3:32:22.760 --> 3:32:25.960]  one of the things that we repeated over and over
[3:32:25.960 --> 3:32:30.040]  is we claimed an informant saw drugs in somebody's house
[3:32:30.040 --> 3:32:33.000]  and that was enough probable cause for a search warrant
[3:32:33.000 --> 3:32:36.840]  when the truth is an informant had never been in the house to see the drugs we
[3:32:36.840 --> 3:32:40.920]  called it a ghost informant and we knew being on a local state level
[3:32:40.920 --> 3:32:45.080]  our informants did not have to show up in court and testify like they do a lot
[3:32:45.080 --> 3:32:49.480]  in federal court so we were protected so no right to face the accuser
[3:32:49.480 --> 3:32:53.480]  right we lied on the search warrants claiming a confidential informant saw
[3:32:53.480 --> 3:32:57.320]  the drugs when they didn't and what would you do then
[3:32:57.320 --> 3:33:00.680]  with the drug planting the drug most of the drug
[3:33:00.680 --> 3:33:05.080]  planning took place through an informant um we would
[3:33:05.080 --> 3:33:08.920]  pull over somebody on the highway and arrest them for drugs
[3:33:08.920 --> 3:33:12.120]  and explain to them if they did three deals for us
[3:33:12.120 --> 3:33:16.200]  that we wouldn't file this case and the three deals means to set somebody up
[3:33:16.200 --> 3:33:19.800]  for drugs and the informants would actually go
[3:33:19.800 --> 3:33:25.080]  into the house hide the drugs in the cushion of a couch
[3:33:25.080 --> 3:33:28.840]  come back out and tell us hey i just saw drugs in their house and we would rate
[3:33:28.840 --> 3:33:32.360]  it the entire time the informant was the one who put the drugs in there
[3:33:32.360 --> 3:33:35.960]  it's very common and you wouldn't feel bad i mean later you did
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:38.920]  it was it was great to just go ruin somebody's life to just go in and
[3:33:38.920 --> 3:33:42.280]  because we're good guys fighting drugs planting drugs i guess the excuse was
[3:33:42.280 --> 3:33:45.960]  we think this person is a drug dealer well they were we couldn't catch them we
[3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:48.600]  really believe they were a drug dealer and we couldn't
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:54.280]  catch them using the legal ways so we crossed those lines and lied
[3:33:54.280 --> 3:33:58.120]  and it's sad i i didn't feel bad for what i was doing then
[3:33:58.120 --> 3:34:01.800]  like i said i i believed i was doing the greater good but i feel horrible about
[3:34:01.800 --> 3:34:04.760]  it now but but during that period though you
[3:34:04.760 --> 3:34:09.320]  did wake up yes it was uh about three months
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:12.840]  before i quit law enforcement i started noticing some things
[3:34:12.840 --> 3:34:17.640]  and i quit law enforcement after i arrested the mayor's son with methamphetamine
[3:34:17.640 --> 3:34:21.560]  and i arrested a city councilman with a bag of pot and a pistol
[3:34:21.560 --> 3:34:26.760]  and then i arrested three crooks that the dea had been chasing for a long time
[3:34:26.760 --> 3:34:31.400]  and i got them all in one sting operation so that pressure pushed me out
[3:34:31.400 --> 3:34:36.120]  i didn't realize the error of my ways until i started raising a family and
[3:34:36.120 --> 3:34:41.560]  met candy and yeah and and she started seeing the pain that was in me and
[3:34:41.560 --> 3:34:44.840]  say what's wrong and i just start crying and tell her
[3:34:44.840 --> 3:34:48.120]  you know all these lives i'd ruin and i didn't know what to do about it he was
[3:34:48.120 --> 3:34:51.720]  truly a mess about it yeah truly so she just kept
[3:34:51.720 --> 3:34:55.400]  taking the alcohol away and when i get home in the evening i'd go back to the
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:34:59.960]  bedroom and smoke a joint and it took a year or so
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:03.800]  of healing and realizing and what to do next and figuring things out
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:06.360]  well that's what's so incredible though about the demonization of marijuana
[3:35:06.360 --> 3:35:10.280]  itself the apothecaries or who the pharmacists were
[3:35:10.280 --> 3:35:14.520]  going back to the when people first hear in the colonies over 350 years ago
[3:35:14.520 --> 3:35:17.880]  it was one of the number one prescribed things by doctors by barbers who were
[3:35:17.880 --> 3:35:21.160]  kind of like a uh you know sub doctor or like a nurse
[3:35:21.160 --> 3:35:26.280]  and by the apothecaries and it was sold out of the americas all over the world
[3:35:26.280 --> 3:35:30.360]  uh ships filled with a hemp with you know they use the mexican name marijuana
[3:35:30.360 --> 3:35:34.360]  like it is now absolutely and and george washington
[3:35:34.360 --> 3:35:38.440]  you can read the old prescriptions from his doctor uh for galt and for headaches
[3:35:38.440 --> 3:35:41.560]  and stomach aches uh george washington didn't just
[3:35:41.560 --> 3:35:45.480]  smoke marijuana on his plantation he grew
[3:35:45.480 --> 3:35:51.160]  marijuana not just a hemp rope you know that type without thc he was a big pot
[3:35:51.160 --> 3:35:54.600]  smoke well well i ran for congress i've done
[3:35:54.600 --> 3:35:59.480]  a live debate and if anybody thinks for a second that marijuana keeps you from
[3:35:59.480 --> 3:36:03.400]  being a producing individual look at me and the millions of others
[3:36:03.400 --> 3:36:06.760]  i mean my whole point is is that is that in the 30s they
[3:36:06.760 --> 3:36:09.960]  they had refer madness saying you murder and kill people on pot
[3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:13.640]  and they made all these movies uh to to demonize it they they changed the name
[3:36:13.640 --> 3:36:17.720]  to marijuana using the spanish name so it sounded alien and then they made
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:21.080]  something that george washington thomas jefferson smoked for two fakes
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:25.000]  in a pipe into something they put you in prison for exactly
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:29.320]  and that's why copbusters and you and never get busted are here
[3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:32.920]  it's a freedom try to take it's a freedom issue it's not just a pot issue
[3:36:32.920 --> 3:36:36.120]  it's not who if you think it's wrong or if i think it's wrong it has nothing to
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:38.840]  do with that it's a freedom issue if i want to do it i should be able to do it
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:42.280]  if i'm not hurting someone else well exactly i'm just speaking to those out
[3:36:42.280 --> 3:36:45.320]  there going listen to him saying he smokes marijuana it's evil it's horrible
[3:36:45.320 --> 3:36:48.520]  it's it's bad the only reason it could be bad is because
[3:36:48.520 --> 3:36:52.680]  they've made it illegal it's now under that culture of other illegal drugs
[3:36:52.680 --> 3:36:55.240]  and so when you're out buying it you don't know if it's good you don't know
[3:36:55.240 --> 3:36:57.480]  if it's been sprayed you don't know if it's tainted
[3:36:57.480 --> 3:37:00.600]  you don't know if paraquad's been sprayed on it and then the dealer may say
[3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:04.120]  i got something else for you that is really bad and see that's why we've
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:08.040]  got to decriminalize it so that it isn't in that whole culture
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:12.200]  well it certainly needs to be switched out of the culture it's in right now
[3:37:12.200 --> 3:37:15.800]  because americans are not going to stop growing it they're not going to stop
[3:37:15.800 --> 3:37:18.760]  smoking it no matter how many of us you put in jail
[3:37:18.760 --> 3:37:21.640]  and if there's one pot smoker in jail we're all in jail
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:25.080]  and then the states passed laws decriminalizing and the feds say no
[3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:28.280]  and swoop in in front well that's what bothers me that's what bothers me people
[3:37:28.280 --> 3:37:30.440]  said well you're supposed to change the laws
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:34.760]  through well i ran for congress i tried that and here's the problem
[3:37:34.760 --> 3:37:38.440]  they say change the laws the right way don't release films don't steam cops
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:42.760]  well every time the american people bring it up on the ballot
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:45.800]  for for instance they just did this in michigan
[3:37:45.800 --> 3:37:49.560]  for medical marijuana the cops the chief of police's are the ones that come out
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:54.120]  and and say no we can't do this and start the marijuana madness thing again
[3:37:54.120 --> 3:37:56.440]  so that the government and the police tell us
[3:37:56.440 --> 3:38:00.360]  go through the proper channels to change the law and then when we try
[3:38:00.360 --> 3:38:03.880]  they come they come against it so it makes absolutely no sense
[3:38:03.880 --> 3:38:08.600]  it's not fair well we've got to start with the ending prohibition on marijuana
[3:38:08.600 --> 3:38:11.240]  and then taxing it and controlling it like anything else
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:14.920]  i don't even like them taxing it for this reason if i can get them to at least
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:17.640]  you know i would take that but that's still saying
[3:38:17.640 --> 3:38:21.320]  we'll pay you money american government if you quit putting us in jail
[3:38:21.320 --> 3:38:25.080]  for something we shouldn't be in jail for anyway they should leave that plant
[3:38:25.080 --> 3:38:28.760]  alone and if they do it will do more good for america
[3:38:28.760 --> 3:38:32.680]  than all the tax money it could ever bring but i want to legalize and tax it
[3:38:32.680 --> 3:38:36.760]  will take well it's an automatic tax it's all i mean you said you know
[3:38:36.760 --> 3:38:41.640]  90 billion dollars a year i mean you're brilliant yeah billion it's already uh
[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:45.480]  a a tax cut if we stop spending that 90 billion a year
[3:38:45.480 --> 3:38:49.560]  yeah good point so i mean right there that's 90 billion dollars
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:52.200]  that we won't be spending that now before we run out of time here and we've got
[3:38:52.200 --> 3:38:56.280]  30 minutes of overdrive but for the full audience with about 18 minutes left
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:01.480]  let's get into uh just a rapid fire some of the worst cases of corruption and
[3:39:01.480 --> 3:39:06.920]  shut-ups you've seen and then get into your latest sting the worst cases of
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:10.200]  corruption would be those where we put people in jail when the
[3:39:10.200 --> 3:39:14.520]  informant planted the drugs and or we lied on the search warrant
[3:39:14.520 --> 3:39:19.720]  and or we caused our dog to false alert when they refused to consent
[3:39:19.720 --> 3:39:24.840]  so we could search their car or taking an eight ball of cocaine out of my
[3:39:24.840 --> 3:39:29.480]  pocket as an officer and sticking it in another man's
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:35.240]  pocket that's handcuffed and telling him if he doesn't call me within 24 hours
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:38.680]  to set somebody else up on a drug bust that
[3:39:38.680 --> 3:39:42.920]  eight ball of cocaine was going to be his then i would take the eight ball of
[3:39:42.920 --> 3:39:45.880]  cocaine out of his pocket and put it back in mine
[3:39:45.880 --> 3:39:49.640]  and within 24 hours he would call me because he was so scared that i would
[3:39:49.640 --> 3:39:54.040]  plant that eight ball on him just terrorizing
[3:39:54.040 --> 3:39:58.840]  americans well before we get into that sting just briefly my story growing up
[3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:02.840]  uh you know by the time i was 12 i had older friends i was playing baseball
[3:40:02.840 --> 3:40:05.640]  with things in the neighborhood in dallas middle class area
[3:40:05.640 --> 3:40:08.760]  rock wall actually they're on the lake and and i'd go over and their older
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:11.160]  brothers would be smoking pot i'd smoke it and wouldn't like the way it made me
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:16.760]  feel uh so i was never really into drugs but but but i saw it going on and and
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:20.760]  this was in a fluent area and so at the time i was about 14 i had friends who
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:24.360]  were now 18 who who i knew we were suddenly driving
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:27.480]  corvettes and having a great time they were being left alone by the police
[3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:31.640]  i'd get pulled over with them in the passenger seat and they go oh you can go
[3:40:31.640 --> 3:40:35.800]  you know uh because they knew them and i would be at a party
[3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:39.240]  and i see a plenty of playing guys playing close guys show up and i knew
[3:40:39.240 --> 3:40:42.600]  these guys for so many years they trusted me suddenly i was in the middle of this
[3:40:42.600 --> 3:40:50.200]  seeing ecstasy cocaine lsd marijuana with police delivering this to teenage and
[3:40:50.200 --> 3:40:54.120]  then you know 20 year old dealers who were running around selling this to all
[3:40:54.120 --> 3:40:58.920]  the yuppies and housewives uh in town and again by the time i was 14 i had a
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:41:02.600]  moped i even had this one guy uh this one friend's older
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:05.400]  brother say hey just just make marijuana deliveries for us right around the
[3:41:05.400 --> 3:41:09.480]  neighborhood and i said no no no then by the time i'm 16 i'm in rock wall high
[3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:12.520]  school and the very cops i know are connected to drug dealing are in and
[3:41:12.520 --> 3:41:15.640]  around the school being called into the school when there's drug bustin things
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:18.280]  and i sort of shoot my mouth off going you guys are dealing the drugs you
[3:41:18.280 --> 3:41:21.640]  shouldn't be putting people in jail and then my dad starts getting calls that
[3:41:21.640 --> 3:41:25.080]  we're going to hang your son in a jail cell they did and pulled me over
[3:41:25.080 --> 3:41:27.320]  threatened me in the in the car said we're going to kill you if you don't
[3:41:27.320 --> 3:41:30.840]  shut up and we had to move from Dallas to Austin
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:33.960]  um you know my dad said that's it you know we're out of here because suddenly
[3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:37.880]  cops were by my house driving around they were pulling me over they called me
[3:41:37.880 --> 3:41:40.360]  into the principal's office and said we know you've stolen all the stereo
[3:41:40.360 --> 3:41:43.720]  equipment and i was honest with the cop i said you're really evil i said i've
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:47.480]  stolen beer out of the backs of golf carts when i was like 13 uh you know a
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:50.440]  few times it'd be these golf carts sitting out parked at the you know pool
[3:41:50.440 --> 3:41:53.960]  by the golf course and i'd we go ah six pack i go that's all i've ever stolen
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:57.000]  and once when i was three i walked out with a candy bar my mom made it you
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:41:59.960]  made me take it back i said i haven't stolen any stereo equipment i'm not a
[3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:03.000]  criminal and he said i know that but we're going to put you in jail and big
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:06.520]  black men are going to rape you if you don't go set people up for us
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:09.480]  so their way of trying to make me shut up is all this was happening
[3:42:09.480 --> 3:42:12.520]  was to try to call me in and say big black men we're going to rape me
[3:42:12.520 --> 3:42:16.760]  if i didn't go set people up for stealing things then they called me in
[3:42:16.760 --> 3:42:19.480]  right before we moved and said you know we know you're involved in all these
[3:42:19.480 --> 3:42:22.600]  other criminal activities we know you're involved in arson
[3:42:22.600 --> 3:42:26.680]  and i was going whoa and then the they found out we were moving
[3:42:26.680 --> 3:42:29.960]  and it was the last day of school and the cop walks out
[3:42:29.960 --> 3:42:34.360]  to my truck you know that the head cop and he says alex
[3:42:34.360 --> 3:42:36.920]  i hear you're moving to austin doesn't matter you're a criminal we're still
[3:42:36.920 --> 3:42:39.400]  going to get you and black men are still going to rape you and give you aides
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:43.800]  jeez and you know i've got some advice for any listeners and this is the
[3:42:43.800 --> 3:42:47.160]  advice we give daily if you're in a jurisdiction and the cops are
[3:42:47.160 --> 3:42:49.960]  picking on you like they were alex and many others
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:53.800]  you need to leave that jurisdiction you need to physically move away from that
[3:42:53.800 --> 3:42:58.360]  address candy and i fled east texas to come to austin
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:02.360]  because just eight months ago one of them in a park you were talking about how
[3:43:02.360 --> 3:43:06.040]  cops shoot people now they've got this neat thing they do and they did it to
[3:43:06.040 --> 3:43:08.440]  candy and i and we're suing the department for it
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:12.200]  we were walking in a park and the guy we got into a confrontation
[3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:18.040]  and the cop a very um calm confrontation i might add
[3:43:18.040 --> 3:43:21.320]  and the cop grabbed his pistol and started screaming
[3:43:21.320 --> 3:43:24.680]  you're not going to shoot me you're not going to shoot me i thought he was going
[3:43:24.680 --> 3:43:27.800]  to shoot him yeah i instantly registered that as this guy's
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:33.000]  setting things up where when he shoots me it's on video and camera that he was
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:36.120]  in fear of his life which is what the cops need before they pull the gun they
[3:43:36.120 --> 3:43:39.480]  have to explain their fear of their life in the threat continuum yes yes so he's
[3:43:39.480 --> 3:43:42.920]  already screaming you're not going to shoot me you're not going to shoot we
[3:43:42.920 --> 3:43:47.080]  shoot me that way if he had to shoot me on the video it's like man i was scared
[3:43:47.080 --> 3:43:49.720]  i thought he was going to shoot me because it was night and i had a cell
[3:43:49.720 --> 3:43:52.040]  phone you know that that's what they're saying now
[3:43:52.040 --> 3:43:55.640]  oh it's crazy down in california sweet yeah and oh we thought he was going to
[3:43:55.640 --> 3:43:58.440]  do something they put out a false story it turns out he was on so we moved to
[3:43:58.440 --> 3:44:02.360]  austin it's safer here than other areas of texas i know the police chief he's
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:05.160]  actually going to be in here in two weeks in studio well he's got a problem
[3:44:05.160 --> 3:44:09.720]  with taking blood from people i know i brought that up to him yeah he's got to
[3:44:09.720 --> 3:44:12.760]  quit that but he at least is is kicking cops off which other
[3:44:12.760 --> 3:44:14.600]  departments want to be shooting people in the back
[3:44:14.600 --> 3:44:17.400]  and that's right and they should be charged yeah well that's his reasonable
[3:44:17.400 --> 3:44:20.440]  service that's not like that chief's doing a favor and i'll
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:23.720]  the i don't have i agree i agree but that's his reasonable service he's
[3:44:23.720 --> 3:44:27.960]  supposed to kick cops off that shoot people but holding people down like
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:32.600]  they've been doing through the holidays here in austin with a search warrant to
[3:44:32.600 --> 3:44:37.560]  pull their blood from them is is crazy oh no i agree
[3:44:37.560 --> 3:44:40.440]  and i saw the chief on oh i know i i didn't think that
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:44.040]  but i do take issue with that i saw him on the news the other day proudly
[3:44:44.040 --> 3:44:49.960]  exclaiming and proclaiming you know what i hate uh that people drink and drive
[3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:55.160]  but my freedoms are more valuable than the dangers even they bring absolutely
[3:44:55.160 --> 3:44:58.040]  and those that claim take you know give us your liberty for security they
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:45:00.760]  always want to set up tyranny and and just finishing the story about rock
[3:45:00.760 --> 3:45:04.920]  wall briefly um right before we moved the sheriff
[3:45:04.920 --> 3:45:08.360]  and i wouldn't have in trouble with them it was the it was the apd or it was the
[3:45:08.360 --> 3:45:13.720]  rock wall pd it was the city got caught by the feds flying cocaine and
[3:45:13.720 --> 3:45:17.160]  marijuana into the rock wall municipal airport so it turned out it was a huge
[3:45:17.160 --> 3:45:21.320]  drug dealing operation to all those wealthy people in that bedroom community
[3:45:21.320 --> 3:45:25.800]  and just because i shot my mouth off a few times that concerned them
[3:45:25.800 --> 3:45:29.160]  and they were getting ready to kill me because then my dad had one of the city
[3:45:29.160 --> 3:45:33.240]  lawyers who he'd known uh you know uh back from college days
[3:45:33.240 --> 3:45:36.280]  call him up and say get your family out of here now
[3:45:36.280 --> 3:45:39.160]  that's all i'm going to tell you get out of here now or your son's going to be
[3:45:39.160 --> 3:45:41.640]  hung in a cell we'd already had that phone call
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:45.240]  and then i had him pull me over say you're drinking while driving
[3:45:45.240 --> 3:45:49.320]  wasn't drinking put me in the car took me to the rock wall jail cell when i was
[3:45:49.320 --> 3:45:52.760]  16 and said that they would kill me if i didn't
[3:45:52.760 --> 3:45:56.760]  shut up now that's america that will fortunately yeah fortunately you got
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:45:59.960]  away yolanda madden and and hundreds of thousands
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:03.640]  of others in this country didn't get away and uh
[3:46:03.640 --> 3:46:07.400]  we're not going to stop until we see some prison doors come come loose
[3:46:07.400 --> 3:46:10.600]  right well this is just an unbelievable interview
[3:46:10.600 --> 3:46:14.520]  tell us about the latest thing um we were
[3:46:14.520 --> 3:46:18.680]  planning to go to washington state where we i have proof and evidence that the
[3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:21.960]  cops there are raiding marijuana grow rooms
[3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:25.320]  using illegal flare cameras the heat imaging cameras
[3:46:25.320 --> 3:46:29.720]  yeah so we set a uh we were going to do that in washington state
[3:46:29.720 --> 3:46:33.720]  we had a group targeted and i got a phone call from a citizen in odessa that
[3:46:33.720 --> 3:46:37.080]  told me my ex partners had planted drugs on his daughter
[3:46:37.080 --> 3:46:41.080]  and wanted to know if i could help so candy and i switched operations

[3:55:38.920 --> 3:55:41.640]  this latest thing you've been talking about in
[3:55:41.640 --> 3:55:44.840]  relation to how are you getting him to sell you videos
[3:55:44.840 --> 3:55:48.840]  i guess it's before you exposed it uh and and then you know later he's claiming
[3:55:48.840 --> 3:55:53.000]  that it was just done for money no no no uh i might not have explained it well
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:56.280]  enough before cop busters was ever invented and we were
[3:55:56.280 --> 3:55:59.320]  just doing never get busted films i needed
[3:55:59.320 --> 3:56:02.920]  FLIR footage and i needed footage of a dog false alerting
[3:56:02.920 --> 3:56:07.800]  so i called one of my ex partners from the permean basin drug task force
[3:56:07.800 --> 3:56:12.840]  he's a yokem county's da's narcotics investigator now
[3:56:12.840 --> 3:56:15.960]  and i asked him if he had any of that for my films
[3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:21.800]  and he sold me that footage i've kept it a secret this entire time
[3:56:21.800 --> 3:56:26.920]  now fast forward to four weeks ago when we set this dummy grow room and put
[3:56:26.920 --> 3:56:30.040]  christmas trees under it instead of marijuana plants
[3:56:30.040 --> 3:56:33.800]  and we triggered the cops to do an illegal raid
[3:56:33.800 --> 3:56:37.960]  he was tied into that raid and i kept telling the chief of police who's
[3:56:37.960 --> 3:56:41.640]  trying to arrest candy and i now because of this operation
[3:56:41.640 --> 3:56:47.080]  we kept explaining check for FLIR cameras because on the search warrant affidavit
[3:56:47.080 --> 3:56:50.680]  the only reasons they had listed for raid the cop busters home of course they
[3:56:50.680 --> 3:56:54.280]  didn't know was a cop busters home was an anonymous letter and they made two
[3:56:54.280 --> 3:56:58.120]  drive-bys on the house well that's not enough probable cause for a judge to
[3:56:58.120 --> 3:57:02.200]  sign the warrant so he got busted as well so i keep telling them look they're
[3:57:02.200 --> 3:57:04.760]  using these illegal FLIR cameras they didn't believe it
[3:57:04.760 --> 3:57:07.480]  so i said in three days i'll announce the proof
[3:57:07.480 --> 3:57:11.000]  which was um monday i announced the proof
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  and i explained that i know they have a FLIR camera
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:21.640]  because one of your officers sold me the footage for my anti-drug war film
[3:57:21.640 --> 3:57:26.040]  so they went drove by our house and flirted illegally
[3:57:26.040 --> 3:57:29.880]  and didn't put that in the warrant the judge signed the warrant and they kicked
[3:57:29.880 --> 3:57:34.200]  our door in and we had hidden cameras in there that said you're part of a reality
[3:57:34.200 --> 3:57:38.760]  show called cop busters and uh all of us are unarmed
[3:57:38.760 --> 3:57:43.400]  there's nothing illegal taking place we'll be approaching within 10 minutes
[3:57:43.400 --> 3:57:47.800]  all wearing red t-shirts so you had a recording going oh yeah hidden cameras
[3:57:47.800 --> 3:57:50.920]  we played that video earlier they were just totally freaked out in fact there's a
[3:57:50.920 --> 3:57:54.920]  video on youtube of the entire raid it's four minutes and you can see the cops
[3:57:54.920 --> 3:57:58.360]  walking around the room trying to figure out what's going on tell you what
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:58:00.760]  what's the name of that youtube we'll pull that up and play it oh just go to
[3:58:00.760 --> 3:58:04.280]  copbusters.com go to the second page there's there it is
[3:58:04.280 --> 3:58:07.640]  right there the second one second one we'll play no no the third one
[3:58:07.640 --> 3:58:12.280]  third one down here yeah the third one that's the yeah that's the entire raid
[3:58:12.280 --> 3:58:17.160]  and we proved their willingness to lie on an affidavit
[3:58:17.160 --> 3:58:20.360]  and we proved their willingness to do an illegal raid
[3:58:20.360 --> 3:58:26.040]  to expose these guys are crooked and we drew the bridge look this is the same
[3:58:26.040 --> 3:58:31.000]  group of guys that just planted the drugs on yolanda and put her in prison for
[3:58:31.000 --> 3:58:34.840]  for eight years so that was the big payoff of this sting
[3:58:34.840 --> 3:58:39.080]  was to bring national attention to the yolanda madden case
[3:58:39.080 --> 3:58:43.480]  by the way in in 60 days we're going to sting another cop so
[3:58:43.480 --> 3:58:48.920]  be ready for that we're not going to stop in fact we could sting him today
[3:58:48.920 --> 3:58:53.640]  but as well as you know you know that alex you know these things take time
[3:58:53.640 --> 3:58:57.640]  and timing's important so we're going to wait a little bit and get him
[3:58:57.640 --> 3:59:01.000]  oh a lot of work goes into this i mean i want to go into courage and talk a
[3:59:01.000 --> 3:59:05.560]  little bit to candy about this i mean men are designed so are women to
[3:59:05.560 --> 3:59:08.360]  be able to go out and confront bullies and and and just
[3:59:08.360 --> 3:59:11.720]  kind of shut off the fear and ignore it because you know it's for the greater
[3:59:11.720 --> 3:59:15.880]  good but but for a woman and again women have great
[3:59:15.880 --> 3:59:20.840]  courage but just still myself being death-threaded myself going and
[3:59:20.840 --> 3:59:24.360]  covering bill berg an elite meeting and people calling up and
[3:59:24.360 --> 3:59:28.120]  having fake women you know call up and say i got i'm pregnant or calling up
[3:59:28.120 --> 3:59:31.800]  threatening our family and our children my wife's a special person she deals
[3:59:31.800 --> 3:59:34.440]  with it she just says i know we're fighting this evil you know she just
[3:59:34.440 --> 3:59:38.280]  laughs at them when they call and and but they're always trying new tricks or
[3:59:38.280 --> 3:59:41.240]  they'll call up and say there's some woman and say alex gave me a
[3:59:41.240 --> 3:59:44.920]  disease or you know just just all sorts of nasty dirty tricks so i've
[3:59:44.920 --> 3:59:48.840]  lived some of what you've lived more from both of you about the types of
[3:59:48.840 --> 3:59:51.240]  threats you get any type of reprisals and
[3:59:51.240 --> 3:59:56.280]  and you know how you so cheerfully have this courage and go through this candy
[3:59:56.280 --> 4:00:01.240]  well courage is contagious and very started the courage so
[4:00:01.240 --> 4:00:06.600]  it's it's i don't know it doesn't bother me we're doing the right thing i know
[4:00:06.600 --> 4:00:09.160]  we're doing the right thing and freedom
[4:00:09.160 --> 4:00:13.800]  you know it's that's a big deal and there's 1.5 million
[4:00:13.800 --> 4:00:18.840]  people in president right now 1.5 yeah well they say that i mean it's really 4 million total
[4:00:18.840 --> 4:00:23.080]  1.5 million children without parents without parents oh my god there's 2
[4:00:23.080 --> 4:00:25.880]  million now actually there's 2 million which the state loves because then they
[4:00:25.880 --> 4:00:29.560]  get to cps the children without due process and then that messes them up
[4:00:29.560 --> 4:00:34.040]  my we have four kids and so i'm just fighting for them
[4:00:34.040 --> 4:00:40.760]  candy candy we work we work with the the same energy that it was one of our
[4:00:40.760 --> 4:00:44.840]  kids sitting in prison exactly because we're not really free if one of our
[4:00:44.840 --> 4:00:47.880]  no that's the total spirit of liberty exact so much
[4:00:47.880 --> 4:00:50.920]  when somebody does something to somebody else i feel as if it's happening to me
[4:00:50.920 --> 4:00:53.640]  right when i see those dead children in gaza
[4:00:53.640 --> 4:00:56.760]  you know i mean because i know that that's why they call it a crime against
[4:00:56.760 --> 4:01:00.200]  humanity people that are tuned in know that when you allow this to go on
[4:01:00.200 --> 4:01:03.160]  anywhere and at least don't speak up against it and fight it
[4:01:03.160 --> 4:01:06.200]  that that you you create a climate where it ends up happening to you or
[4:01:06.200 --> 4:01:08.760]  somebody you love that's exactly right and that's
[4:01:08.760 --> 4:01:12.840]  what's happened in america my father and grandfather
[4:01:12.840 --> 4:01:17.720]  voted their checkbooks and left it to a few select to protect their freedoms
[4:01:17.720 --> 4:01:21.400]  and now they left us with an america that is not free
[4:01:21.400 --> 4:01:25.160]  and we've realized that the citizens have to we can't we can't look to the
[4:01:25.160 --> 4:01:28.200]  police we can't look to the politicians we can't look to these people the
[4:01:28.200 --> 4:01:32.360]  government for our freedoms the citizens have to fight back and our
[4:01:32.360 --> 4:01:37.320]  weapons of warfare our video cameras the internet
[4:01:37.320 --> 4:01:40.520]  and courage we need to take it those are our weapons of warfare we don't have
[4:01:40.520 --> 4:01:44.200]  guns we can't shoot the police we can't put them in jail they have jails and
[4:01:44.200 --> 4:01:48.520]  guns well there's another weapon we have lawsuits get out and sue the police
[4:01:48.520 --> 4:01:53.240]  jam the courts it only costs 350 there's youtube clips of me explaining this
[4:01:53.240 --> 4:01:57.880]  costs 350 walk down the federal courthouse and get a pro se packet
[4:01:57.880 --> 4:02:01.320]  takes an hour to fill it out and wallah the cops are sued in federal court
[4:02:01.320 --> 4:02:04.600]  candy and i have done it we sued a judge in a police department
[4:02:04.600 --> 4:02:08.680]  cost us 350 dollars it's it's wonderful and even if they beat the rap they don't
[4:02:08.680 --> 4:02:11.800]  beat the ride that's right listen the attorney general has to spend money
[4:02:11.800 --> 4:02:15.960]  getting them expunged it's enlist everybody list the judges list everybody
[4:02:15.960 --> 4:02:20.280]  on the lawsuit and uh you know they'll get the judge recused from the lawsuit
[4:02:20.280 --> 4:02:24.040]  because they have immunity but what it does do for you is it puts you in a
[4:02:24.040 --> 4:02:27.320]  position that judge can never sit in judgment against you again
[4:02:27.320 --> 4:02:30.200]  because you sued them sure they have to get an outside visiting judge
[4:02:30.200 --> 4:02:34.520]  there's strategy involved sure can't messes their whole system up we like that or
[4:02:34.520 --> 4:02:38.120]  sometimes they don't recuse themselves and get more in trouble for for
[4:02:38.120 --> 4:02:41.720]  for violating the rules you know instead of myself just throwing out
[4:02:41.720 --> 4:02:44.920]  questions other points other important things you want to relay to people out
[4:02:44.920 --> 4:02:50.280]  there just have courage
[4:02:50.280 --> 4:02:56.200]  just have courage stand up you know keep fighting keep fighting don't give up
[4:02:56.200 --> 4:03:00.440]  don't be a don't be afraid don't be scared just you know we'll help
[4:03:00.440 --> 4:03:06.280]  get on and do the cop busters report a cop you know well i'll tell you i'm suing
[4:03:06.280 --> 4:03:09.880]  cops do what you can i'll tell you i i get afraid when i'm not fighting
[4:03:09.880 --> 4:03:13.000]  i get upset when i'm not doing something that's what i'm
[4:03:13.000 --> 4:03:16.520]  but when you're standing up there's i don't have any fear
[4:03:16.520 --> 4:03:20.520]  is that what you're experiencing yes yeah i we're not afraid no we're not at
[4:03:20.520 --> 4:03:25.320]  all that's the neat thing about courage courage will take the fear away if you
[4:03:25.320 --> 4:03:28.360]  start exercising it it's like a muscle yeah now i'm not
[4:03:28.360 --> 4:03:31.480]  recommending for everybody to come out of the closet today and say i smoke pot
[4:03:31.480 --> 4:03:33.640]  because you might lose your job you might go to jail
[4:03:33.640 --> 4:03:37.160]  but there are all kinds of cool ways you can help
[4:03:37.160 --> 4:03:41.160]  stand up and fight this war i didn't have the courage i have now i mean that
[4:03:41.160 --> 4:03:45.480]  took a while from being with him especially it took a while for me to
[4:03:45.480 --> 4:03:48.440]  just stand up and go face the cops with them you know it
[4:03:48.440 --> 4:03:52.840]  that took a lot of now it's like habit the more you do it
[4:03:52.840 --> 4:03:56.760]  you know the more you have yeah the more courage you have so well i mean it's the
[4:03:56.760 --> 4:04:00.760]  arrogance and and you know six thousand plus people that are
[4:04:00.760 --> 4:04:03.720]  you know police officers against prohibition and growing these judges and
[4:04:03.720 --> 4:04:07.720]  some high-powered high-level coming out in a grain more and more people standing
[4:04:07.720 --> 4:04:10.920]  up i don't want to just indict all the police car blanche but
[4:04:10.920 --> 4:04:14.200]  when it is a corrupt sickening system across the board
[4:04:14.200 --> 4:04:17.240]  and they're so arrogant about it and the one town i grew up in they were
[4:04:17.240 --> 4:04:21.240]  dealing drugs and threatening teenagers to shut up
[4:04:21.240 --> 4:04:24.600]  i mean this is a great evil that's grown and now it's being federalized with
[4:04:24.600 --> 4:04:28.200]  homeland security now i mean we have to say no now
[4:04:28.200 --> 4:04:31.320]  because anytime you let national security run everything anytime the
[4:04:31.320 --> 4:04:34.600]  people aren't involved anytime you just say oh do whatever you want
[4:04:34.600 --> 4:04:39.880]  you're going to get a tyranny well you know america it is okay to talk
[4:04:39.880 --> 4:04:44.120]  bad about police without having to say the all too common phrase
[4:04:44.120 --> 4:04:47.960]  now most of them are good it's only a few that make them all look bad that's not
[4:04:47.960 --> 4:04:51.960]  true it's the system it is the system for one they're dealing with a corrupt
[4:04:51.960 --> 4:04:56.760]  handbook the penal code itself is corrupt so if you have men that rally
[4:04:56.760 --> 4:05:00.520]  around a corrupt book even though they might not break
[4:05:00.520 --> 4:05:03.160]  they might not plant drugs they might not break
[4:05:03.160 --> 4:05:07.560]  policies they are breaking constitutional law
[4:05:07.560 --> 4:05:11.640]  and they are the enemy and they are corrupt because they picked up a book
[4:05:11.640 --> 4:05:15.720]  that they go by that's anti-american that's another issue finish up with any
[4:05:15.720 --> 4:05:18.920]  other threats you've gotten and then what happens to good cops because i've
[4:05:18.920 --> 4:05:21.880]  interviewed a lot of famous new york detectives one
[4:05:21.880 --> 4:05:25.160]  of them was the guy that ended up getting like 75 percent of the detectives
[4:05:25.160 --> 4:05:27.800]  fired when it came out most of them were dealing drugs you know
[4:05:27.800 --> 4:05:31.240]  people like serpica where they shoot him in the face i mean we know though that
[4:05:31.240 --> 4:05:34.920]  cops that won't you know first day as a detective hey keep this jewelry i took
[4:05:34.920 --> 4:05:38.520]  off a thug you know they start corrupting you right then
[4:05:38.520 --> 4:05:44.120]  it's certainly a process of corruption and as you mentioned earlier it's an us
[4:05:44.120 --> 4:05:46.760]  against them attitude they're supposed to be a
[4:05:46.760 --> 4:05:51.400]  citizen's police force yet they show up to the scenes
[4:05:51.400 --> 4:05:54.680]  looking who they can arrest when you're shoot
[4:05:54.680 --> 4:05:58.520]  there needs to be an entire paradigm shift so it's predatory yeah they need to
[4:05:58.520 --> 4:06:01.960]  show up to the scene saying act wondering in their own minds
[4:06:01.960 --> 4:06:05.640]  who can i help who can i protect justice who can i assist
[4:06:05.640 --> 4:06:09.000]  let me take firefighters the firefighters on the dart platform
[4:06:09.000 --> 4:06:11.720]  when the unarmed guy they slam him down shoot him in the back
[4:06:11.720 --> 4:06:15.480]  but they confiscate the videos before it's known that people shot videos that
[4:06:15.480 --> 4:06:18.440]  they didn't see out of another train that was stopped
[4:06:18.440 --> 4:06:22.200]  they said all the videos malfunctioned that were in the dart platform
[4:06:22.200 --> 4:06:25.480]  uh and there were no other videos well they had grabbed and taken two cell
[4:06:25.480 --> 4:06:28.360]  phones from people that did videotape it but they didn't get all the cameras
[4:06:28.360 --> 4:06:33.480]  so again there's that total culture of of we're all enemies they're militarized
[4:06:33.480 --> 4:06:36.600]  and they're all just freaking out when there's no enemy and then they kill this
[4:06:36.600 --> 4:06:40.440]  guy and then they go and try to cover it up just just look at how they dress and
[4:06:40.440 --> 4:06:44.360]  how they look they've kind of got that skin head
[4:06:44.360 --> 4:06:47.640]  tight look they all look the same and that's because
[4:06:47.640 --> 4:06:52.040]  it's only that genre or or group of people
[4:06:52.040 --> 4:06:57.000]  that are willing to do what cops have to do now well what happened to good cops
[4:06:57.000 --> 4:07:00.040]  that you saw i mean when when people start saying no what
[4:07:00.040 --> 4:07:04.680]  happens well like what happened to me when i was
[4:07:04.680 --> 4:07:09.000]  doing my job and i rested the mayor's son and i rested the city councilman for
[4:07:09.000 --> 4:07:12.600]  marijuana they start pushing pushing you out when you get too close
[4:07:12.600 --> 4:07:17.880]  but but the good you know i it's hard for me to say there are good cops
[4:07:17.880 --> 4:07:21.080]  because if the citizens know about all the corruption
[4:07:21.080 --> 4:07:24.840]  we know for sure the good cops quote unquote good cops in the department
[4:07:24.840 --> 4:07:29.000]  know about the corruption and they're turning a blind eye to it
[4:07:29.000 --> 4:07:32.360]  when they're sworn to uphold the constitution and protect the american
[4:07:32.360 --> 4:07:35.880]  people those good cops should be turning on all the bad
[4:07:35.880 --> 4:07:39.640]  cops where the good cops how come they're not emailing me saying berry
[4:07:39.640 --> 4:07:43.960]  i'm glad you caught cops in an illegal raid we need to do more of this
[4:07:43.960 --> 4:07:47.800]  in fact i've got a cop in my unit that does the same thing and i'll help you
[4:07:47.800 --> 4:07:51.400]  bust him so see it's hard for me to say there are good
[4:07:51.400 --> 4:07:56.200]  cops if there are good cops how come they're not taking a stance
[4:07:56.200 --> 4:08:01.560]  and helping us helping you helping the americans get their freedoms back
[4:08:01.560 --> 4:08:05.160]  they're not doing it because there are no good cops they can say i'm good i'm
[4:08:05.160 --> 4:08:09.880]  good i'm good but talk is cheap no no i let's see it i agree with you
[4:08:09.880 --> 4:08:13.720]  when the systems corrupt and officers that don't
[4:08:13.720 --> 4:08:16.920]  officially get involved in the corruption they don't have their hands in it
[4:08:16.920 --> 4:08:21.000]  but they stand by and turn to blind eye they are now accessories they're part
[4:08:21.000 --> 4:08:25.240]  of it just like if i see somebody being murdered and i turn to buy a blind eye
[4:08:25.240 --> 4:08:29.320]  and i don't help i'm in trouble it's the same with the police officers in this
[4:08:29.320 --> 4:08:33.720]  land i have zero respect for law enforcement i want to have
[4:08:33.720 --> 4:08:38.120]  respect for law enforcement we need law enforcement there are crazy people or
[4:08:38.120 --> 4:08:41.880]  animals in this land that want to hurt me and candy and my children
[4:08:41.880 --> 4:08:45.480]  so i have a lot of respect for cages to lock those kind of people up
[4:08:45.480 --> 4:08:48.520]  but uh a lot of those are the cops yeah a lot of those are the cops i want to
[4:08:48.520 --> 4:08:51.000]  hurt me you know i don't have any respect for our criminal
[4:08:51.000 --> 4:08:54.840]  justice system in america and we're going to continue dismantling it
[4:08:54.840 --> 4:08:59.320]  doing whatever we can until the the next tears that come to my eyes
[4:08:59.320 --> 4:09:02.680]  are going to be the tears of joys watching those prison doors shake
[4:09:02.680 --> 4:09:05.880]  yes yes absolutely because they have to have a phony pretext
[4:09:05.880 --> 4:09:09.880]  to put people in prison for substances when it really is an illness
[4:09:09.880 --> 4:09:13.480]  i mean here i am drinking coffee i quit smoking for a month start back in i'm
[4:09:13.480 --> 4:09:16.280]  out there smoking cigarettes during the breaks uh
[4:09:16.280 --> 4:09:20.680]  the the neuron receptors that coffee and cigarettes hit
[4:09:20.680 --> 4:09:25.160]  are the same ones that narcotics hit so i'm literally using something that hits
[4:09:25.160 --> 4:09:28.360]  narcotic receptors this is a narcotic amphetamine
[4:09:28.360 --> 4:09:32.760]  i am drinking it right now i can do two cups of coffee
[4:09:32.760 --> 4:09:36.840]  and it speeds me up more than one line of cocaine
[4:09:36.840 --> 4:09:40.760]  and that's my point is that yeah it is that it needs to be
[4:09:40.760 --> 4:09:44.680]  smoking it and good cocaine isn't good cigarettes aren't good and out of all
[4:09:44.680 --> 4:09:49.880]  these drugs that we know are bad uh we know that it is marijuana that
[4:09:49.880 --> 4:09:53.560]  actually has all these health effects right you can you can get rid of 90
[4:09:53.560 --> 4:09:57.160]  percent of the pills in your life and in america's life
[4:09:57.160 --> 4:10:01.320]  with that pot you can stop the alcoholism the people that are on the pros
[4:10:01.320 --> 4:10:04.600]  act the uptake inhibitors like you were talking about well that's why they now
[4:10:04.600 --> 4:10:07.480]  they need a tripod that's why big pharma has thousands of
[4:10:07.480 --> 4:10:11.160]  prescriptions now with thc but they've noticed it isn't as good because it's
[4:10:11.160 --> 4:10:14.440]  not mixed with all the other little co-factors that are in there i mean
[4:10:14.440 --> 4:10:20.040]  marijuana really is a magic plant it's a medicine you know people to people
[4:10:20.040 --> 4:10:23.400]  all the time talk about it helps patients with glaucoma and cancer
[4:10:23.400 --> 4:10:27.720]  i would my stomach was so bad i i thought i was gonna die
[4:10:27.720 --> 4:10:32.440]  except pancreatitis and crones and if i hadn't had the pot
[4:10:32.440 --> 4:10:36.200]  i don't i don't think i would have made it because i was down to 90 pounds and
[4:10:36.200 --> 4:10:39.320]  well you know crones is caused mainly by the vaccines it didn't exist until the
[4:10:39.320 --> 4:10:41.800]  vaccines and almost everybody they've tested their
[4:10:41.800 --> 4:10:46.440]  intestines uh it is a uh a virus that was in a particular
[4:10:46.440 --> 4:10:50.360]  vaccine for measles mumps rubella that did that we have one of the
[4:10:50.360 --> 4:10:54.840]  we have one of the autistic kids from that to our five six-year-olds oh my god
[4:10:54.840 --> 4:10:57.720]  but but people talk about like it helped her she say you've been abused by it
[4:10:57.720 --> 4:11:01.320]  right there it's everywhere right she's been hit by the vaccines
[4:11:01.320 --> 4:11:06.680]  right and and uh the what's what everybody's talking
[4:11:06.680 --> 4:11:09.880]  about how marijuana is such a good medicine for cancer patients and
[4:11:09.880 --> 4:11:14.760]  glaucoma what about people like me that really works on themselves i have all
[4:11:14.760 --> 4:11:20.200]  my life to be a better person and i can't calm myself down sometimes it's
[4:11:20.200 --> 4:11:24.280]  and i smoke if i pray for 80 yeah if i took xanax and stuff like that it has a
[4:11:24.280 --> 4:11:27.400]  bad side effect and i couldn't do that but i smoke a
[4:11:27.400 --> 4:11:30.520]  little pot and it calms me down and i'm a nicer person
[4:11:30.520 --> 4:11:34.760]  you know it should be prescribed to our criminals the true criminals
[4:11:34.760 --> 4:11:38.520]  that burglarize and rape and murder well that's it listen listen they're putting
[4:11:38.520 --> 4:11:41.960]  them in jail for p.m. dirty for pot they should prescribe it to them and give it
[4:11:41.960 --> 4:11:47.880]  to them in jail i had cars stolen twice okay uh back in college had a girlfriend
[4:11:47.880 --> 4:11:51.400]  in dallas so i can't drive up there every weekend and and i and decent
[4:11:51.400 --> 4:11:54.520]  neighborhood had had the had the mustang stolen twice
[4:11:54.520 --> 4:11:59.560]  and i'd call the dallas pd and i'd say uh okay green mustang stolen and they'd
[4:11:59.560 --> 4:12:02.840]  say oh we don't even investigate car thefts anymore
[4:12:02.840 --> 4:12:06.840]  and i said okay we can't help me and i hung up the phone bang bang bang open the
[4:12:06.840 --> 4:12:10.360]  door the cops bust in guns drawn but they weren't rude but they
[4:12:10.360 --> 4:12:13.560]  violated my fourth amendment came into her apartment went through the whole
[4:12:13.560 --> 4:12:16.520]  place looking for something illegal and then said you're not supposed to hang
[4:12:16.520 --> 4:12:19.400]  up on 911 i said well i can't okay can't help me
[4:12:19.400 --> 4:12:23.400]  bang uh so well they actually gave me a
[4:12:23.400 --> 4:12:26.280]  number they said later it may show up at this toe shop if it's been
[4:12:26.280 --> 4:12:29.480]  you know left on the road somewhere which it did a few days later but then i
[4:12:29.480 --> 4:12:33.240]  said okay thanks for the number boom the cops show up
[4:12:33.240 --> 4:12:36.280]  my point is is that there's real criminals everywhere there's there's real
[4:12:36.280 --> 4:12:39.720]  crime going on the economy going down there's rapes and burglaries and home
[4:12:39.720 --> 4:12:42.120]  invasions let me let me speak to that investors and
[4:12:42.120 --> 4:12:47.160]  absolutely well it's exactly like you said uh they're
[4:12:47.160 --> 4:12:51.960]  they're concentrating in arresting people that are nonviolent
[4:12:51.960 --> 4:12:55.800]  and overlooking the violent offenders to the tune of
[4:12:55.800 --> 4:13:00.120]  you know people at molest children are being released out of prison to make
[4:13:00.120 --> 4:13:04.200]  room for pot smokers and by the way i've got a section
[4:13:04.200 --> 4:13:07.960]  and never get rated called knock and talks or tapping wraps a whole
[4:13:07.960 --> 4:13:10.760]  they're now doing that for guns yeah yeah i've got a perfect
[4:13:10.760 --> 4:13:13.960]  i'd like you to beat it a hundred a hundred percent of the time with my
[4:13:13.960 --> 4:13:17.080]  method and never tell us the method and folks get the video never answer the
[4:13:17.080 --> 4:13:20.840]  door for the cops ever ever ever ever don't answer the door
[4:13:20.840 --> 4:13:24.840]  you go next to a window open the curtain and say i don't open the door for cops
[4:13:24.840 --> 4:13:28.520]  if you have a search warrant kick the door because if they're knocking on your
[4:13:28.520 --> 4:13:31.160]  door that's telling you they don't have the problem
[4:13:31.160 --> 4:13:34.120]  they want to talk to you they want to talk to you to claim they smelled
[4:13:34.120 --> 4:13:38.040]  marijuana they want the door open so they can claim they smelled marijuana
[4:13:38.040 --> 4:13:41.160]  and search your house or don't open the door or claim that they believe that
[4:13:41.160 --> 4:13:45.480]  there may be a threat to them exactly yeah exactly they use that all the time
[4:13:45.480 --> 4:13:48.600]  you know i felt officer sake listen in the academy
[4:13:48.600 --> 4:13:52.200]  when i graduated the police academy after 10 weeks
[4:13:52.200 --> 4:13:56.360]  only 10 weeks i was 21 years old i was afraid of civilians
[4:13:56.360 --> 4:14:00.120]  they made me believe every traffic stop i was going to be involved with
[4:14:00.120 --> 4:14:04.680]  i could die on that traffic stop so i was the guy who walked up real careful and
[4:14:04.680 --> 4:14:08.440]  scared ready to shoot citizens because that's how
[4:14:08.440 --> 4:14:11.400]  we were trained meanwhile statistically more police get killed
[4:14:11.400 --> 4:14:14.600]  according to traffic accidents yeah yeah only
[4:14:14.600 --> 4:14:20.840]  only 28 cops according to the fbi the uniform crime reporting act
[4:14:20.840 --> 4:14:26.280]  only eight uh only 28 cops have died in drug related
[4:14:26.280 --> 4:14:33.160]  offenses in a 10 year period from 90 uh 96 to 2006
[4:14:33.160 --> 4:14:36.440]  they make us believe cops are getting shot every day in this war on drugs
[4:14:36.440 --> 4:14:41.240]  only 2.8 cops per year are dying in this war on drugs
[4:14:41.240 --> 4:14:45.400]  compared to the millions of americans getting put in jail and getting shot
[4:14:45.400 --> 4:14:49.560]  and whoever said the life of a cop was more valuable than the life of a
[4:14:49.560 --> 4:14:52.680]  citizen it's supposed to be the other way around and we now well now they have
[4:14:52.680 --> 4:14:57.560]  huge official parades for a dead drug dog and and then it's like
[4:14:57.560 --> 4:15:03.960]  remember down in houston we couldn't believe it couldn't what about this 8 000 deaths
[4:15:03.960 --> 4:15:10.360]  on the contiguous uh 2 300 mile border uh with the united states in
[4:15:10.360 --> 4:15:14.680]  northern mexico 8 000 deaths in 2008 and that was with a month
[4:15:14.680 --> 4:15:19.880]  running so back in uh november who knows it may be above 8 000
[4:15:19.880 --> 4:15:24.360]  2 000 on the texas mexico border alone and then over 500 people killed just
[4:15:24.360 --> 4:15:28.440]  across the border with texas so we're talking you know just just masses of
[4:15:28.440 --> 4:15:31.880]  dead people rocket attacks car bombs whole
[4:15:31.880 --> 4:15:35.960]  cities basically shut down the texas border i've been down there it's scary
[4:15:35.960 --> 4:15:39.880]  and the drug gangs are completely taking over because they've made drugs illegal
[4:15:39.880 --> 4:15:43.480]  it makes these huge profits in it and so the criminals have a whole new theater
[4:15:43.480 --> 4:15:46.520]  to operate in and let me tell you the police are scared to death of those
[4:15:46.520 --> 4:15:49.240]  people and they're just leaving all that alone down there well and they're keeping
[4:15:49.240 --> 4:15:52.520]  that quiet and they're even killing federal officers every
[4:15:52.520 --> 4:15:55.880]  few weeks and shooting at people but that's all kept quiet and they
[4:15:55.880 --> 4:16:00.920]  hype up some cop getting shot in chicago okay well the attorney general of uh
[4:16:00.920 --> 4:16:08.360]  of arizona after they got that like three big three ton marijuana bust
[4:16:08.360 --> 4:16:12.200]  last couple of weeks and he was involved in the investigation when he
[4:16:12.200 --> 4:16:15.720]  announced the large bust he also announced that
[4:16:15.720 --> 4:16:19.080]  he's for legalization of marijuana because those drug cartels you're
[4:16:19.080 --> 4:16:23.880]  talking about fund their operations 80 percent of it
[4:16:23.880 --> 4:16:27.960]  marijuana that's it i mean listen again alcoholism tripled
[4:16:27.960 --> 4:16:32.040]  during prohibition it energized the mob which grew over a thousand percent
[4:16:32.040 --> 4:16:35.320]  that's the fed zone numbers it corrupted police
[4:16:35.320 --> 4:16:38.760]  it destroyed our society and when they lost that they brought in drug
[4:16:38.760 --> 4:16:41.800]  prohibition to keep that scam and business going
[4:16:41.800 --> 4:16:45.800]  you know uh i want to continue here and come back with some final comments from
[4:16:45.800 --> 4:16:49.320]  both of you but instead of playing the video uh
[4:16:49.320 --> 4:16:54.440]  let's let's go to the six minute clip uh that you were talking about where
[4:16:54.440 --> 4:16:57.480]  you're challenging police which clip is that so they know which one to play
[4:16:57.480 --> 4:17:02.840]  that's a police yeah plea to the police on never get rated it's the volume two
[4:17:02.840 --> 4:17:06.680]  and i you'll see in a minute i explain to the cops
[4:17:06.680 --> 4:17:11.080]  an alternative way of running a search warrant until we get the drug war
[4:17:11.080 --> 4:17:13.880]  repealed i've got a full proof plan in there
[4:17:13.880 --> 4:17:17.880]  how to raid houses and never cause any harm in fact
[4:17:17.880 --> 4:17:22.040]  there was a sheriff in west texas that when we went into his jurisdiction
[4:17:22.040 --> 4:17:25.000]  that's how he insisted we raided the house
[4:17:25.000 --> 4:17:30.120]  and it's in this clip cops do not have to throw flash grenades through windows
[4:17:30.120 --> 4:17:33.400]  and uh surround the house with swat gear
[4:17:33.400 --> 4:17:37.320]  and terrorized families to search for the drug well now they're also converting
[4:17:37.320 --> 4:17:40.360]  the giant drug war apparatus they're keeping its funding the same or
[4:17:40.360 --> 4:17:43.160]  increasing it but they're now dual training for political
[4:17:43.160 --> 4:17:45.960]  prisoners against the american people anti-terror
[4:17:45.960 --> 4:17:49.080]  they're using the whole informant system now in homeland security
[4:17:49.080 --> 4:17:52.520]  to spy on people for their political views the state police all over the
[4:17:52.520 --> 4:17:54.840]  country have been caught sure you see in the press
[4:17:54.840 --> 4:17:58.600]  uh spying on groups that are against toll roads spying on groups
[4:17:58.600 --> 4:18:02.600]  that are against the war spying on groups that lobby for bike lanes
[4:18:02.600 --> 4:18:05.080]  i mean that and they're and they're putting in the files that they are
[4:18:05.080 --> 4:18:08.520]  terrorist for those views and using anti-terror laws
[4:18:08.520 --> 4:18:11.720]  so now they've created the phony drug war they're now expanding it into the
[4:18:11.720 --> 4:18:14.280]  terror war against the american people and now they've
[4:18:14.280 --> 4:18:18.440]  announced 20 000 u.s mainline army troops to be used at check
[4:18:18.440 --> 4:18:21.880]  points for drunk drivers and they've got marines in california running
[4:18:21.880 --> 4:18:25.400]  checkpoints uh in uh in multiple counties searching
[4:18:25.400 --> 4:18:29.160]  people's cars that's now in the news and so boy i mean we've got to stop it
[4:18:29.160 --> 4:18:33.400]  people are leaving america they're leaving this country because of that
[4:18:33.400 --> 4:18:39.960]  in the next two in the next two years if it continues like it's continuing and
[4:18:39.960 --> 4:18:42.680]  we can't get anything changed and we can't get anything we're going to
[4:18:42.680 --> 4:18:46.920]  continue our fight in america but we're going to do it from some other country
[4:18:46.920 --> 4:18:51.720]  it's not safe here in america but the media the mainstream media glosses it
[4:18:51.720 --> 4:18:54.760]  over the mainstream media is the old am channel which
[4:18:54.760 --> 4:18:59.240]  is what i like you know fox and cnn and and the
[4:18:59.240 --> 4:19:02.360]  and newspapers you know newspapers are a thing of the past
[4:19:02.360 --> 4:19:06.200]  but i mean if the internet is the new fm and
[4:19:06.200 --> 4:19:10.200]  no i agree with a million my point is is that is that they gloss it all over
[4:19:10.200 --> 4:19:12.200]  they even gloss over them killing this guy
[4:19:12.200 --> 4:19:15.640]  you know uh in california they just glossed they go well you can see he was
[4:19:15.640 --> 4:19:19.000]  scuffling slamming down he's not moving they kill him and the media goes well
[4:19:19.000 --> 4:19:21.640]  he was scuffling i guess they needed to kill him
[4:19:21.640 --> 4:19:26.920]  i mean again the system does all this pr selling us that it's okay but they
[4:19:26.920 --> 4:19:29.800]  don't see the statistics they grab over a million children
[4:19:29.800 --> 4:19:33.080]  would cps a year in this country and there's no due process and briefly
[4:19:33.080 --> 4:19:35.320]  before we go to the school when we come back from this club
[4:19:35.320 --> 4:19:38.440]  talk about what it was like when you would see the cps coming
[4:19:38.440 --> 4:19:41.480]  and grabbing the children after you've done a drug raid and the horror in the
[4:19:41.480 --> 4:19:43.480]  children that you mentioned a little bit earlier
[4:19:43.480 --> 4:19:46.200]  and then we'll probably end it with that and let you guys eat some of the pizza
[4:19:46.200 --> 4:19:49.960]  we just got out there let's go ahead and go to this
[4:19:49.960 --> 4:19:53.560]  uh... clip uh where you're a plea to the police
[4:19:53.560 --> 4:19:56.680]  to look in their own hearts and to realize they're part of something very
[4:19:56.680 --> 4:20:04.120]  very wicked and so we can change this before it's too late here it is
[4:20:04.120 --> 4:20:09.240]  when i was a police officer swat teams were very rare
[4:20:09.240 --> 4:20:18.120]  now it seems every town has a little swat team
[4:20:26.680 --> 4:20:31.240]  during the shooting of this film we learned that three days ago
[4:20:31.240 --> 4:20:38.600]  in a small town in ohio a swat team rated a 25-year-old mother with six
[4:20:38.600 --> 4:20:43.640]  children they used flash grenades and machine guns
[4:20:43.640 --> 4:20:47.880]  shooting and killing the 25-year-old mother
[4:20:47.880 --> 4:20:51.160]  shooting the one-year-old baby in her arms
[4:20:51.160 --> 4:20:55.160]  the one-year-old baby had to have a finger amputated
[4:20:55.160 --> 4:20:57.720]  they're not sure what's going to happen to the arm
[4:20:57.720 --> 4:21:05.560]  does america need another drug case that bad that they have to shoot and kill a
[4:21:05.560 --> 4:21:09.080]  25-year-old mother and a one-year-old baby
[4:21:09.080 --> 4:21:13.400]  and what's even crazier is there is a non-violent way
[4:21:13.400 --> 4:21:18.040]  to conduct search warrants many cops have heard about the west texas
[4:21:18.040 --> 4:21:21.560]  sheriff that used to conduct raids in a non
[4:21:21.560 --> 4:21:26.840]  manner you remember how if he had a search warrant for a person's home
[4:21:26.840 --> 4:21:31.720]  he simply did surveillance on the house until the residents drove away
[4:21:31.720 --> 4:21:35.560]  and he pulled them over on a traffic stop arrested them
[4:21:35.560 --> 4:21:38.920]  got the keys to the house interviewed the suspect
[4:21:38.920 --> 4:21:42.280]  ultimately resulting in placing a key in a door and
[4:21:42.280 --> 4:21:47.160]  opening the house and calling the other people forward to arrest them
[4:21:47.160 --> 4:21:51.960]  without any shots being fired without any flash grenades without any of that
[4:21:51.960 --> 4:21:56.600]  stuff listen i know what the police are doing
[4:21:56.600 --> 4:21:59.640]  you're breaking into these homes in this manner
[4:21:59.640 --> 4:22:03.240]  not because you have to but because you have this huge
[4:22:03.240 --> 4:22:06.840]  adrenaline rush and you think it's cool it's not
[4:22:06.840 --> 4:22:10.520]  cool terrorizing our american families so please
[4:22:10.520 --> 4:22:16.120]  until we get this drug war repealed change your way of breaking into our
[4:22:16.120 --> 4:22:21.080]  homes so we don't have to go to the funerals of 25-year-old mothers
[4:22:21.080 --> 4:22:30.600]  and we don't handicap a one-year-old baby the rest of his life
[4:22:30.600 --> 4:22:35.480]  buried i have four wonderful kids who are straight a students and popular
[4:22:35.480 --> 4:22:38.520]  wherever they go the reason for this is because we teach
[4:22:38.520 --> 4:22:41.880]  our kids the truth about everything including drugs
[4:22:41.880 --> 4:22:48.520]  candy's exactly right parents stop trusting government programs
[4:22:48.520 --> 4:22:53.240]  such as dare to teach your kids the truth about drugs
[4:22:53.240 --> 4:22:57.720]  they're not teaching the truth they're teaching lies
[4:22:57.720 --> 4:23:02.520]  did you know in five thousand years of recorded use
[4:23:02.520 --> 4:23:06.440]  not one person has ever overdosed on marijuana
[4:23:06.440 --> 4:23:11.720]  you know it's sad our kids have to share books in our public school systems
[4:23:11.720 --> 4:23:15.400]  and struggle to get money to go to college
[4:23:15.400 --> 4:23:23.480]  yet we spend 17 million dollars a day housing our nonviolent drug offenders
[4:23:23.480 --> 4:23:29.400]  we built 21 prisons in the state of california last year
[4:23:29.400 --> 4:23:34.760]  and only one university parents something is backwards
[4:23:34.760 --> 4:23:39.080]  i want you to think about something when was the last time heard of a kid
[4:23:39.080 --> 4:23:43.240]  dying from an illegal drug in your neighborhood
[4:23:43.240 --> 4:23:49.560]  it's very very rare it's not the drugs that are killing our kids
[4:23:49.560 --> 4:23:56.920]  it's prohibition do you realize we have 1.5 million children
[4:23:56.920 --> 4:24:01.240]  without one or both parents because of the drug war
[4:24:01.240 --> 4:24:05.720]  that's right their parents are setting out a nonviolent drug crime
[4:24:05.720 --> 4:24:10.680]  now what causes more harm the drug or the kids not being with their parents
[4:24:10.680 --> 4:24:15.000]  and finally we must be honest about our parenting skills
[4:24:15.000 --> 4:24:20.520]  we've all made mistakes there is absolutely no evidence that says
[4:24:20.520 --> 4:24:26.840]  when a kid uses drugs it causes them to go burglarize or commit another crime
[4:24:26.840 --> 4:24:31.560]  the truth is selfishness and dishonor and disrespect
[4:24:31.560 --> 4:24:38.120]  are causing those things it's easy for parents and teachers and doctors
[4:24:38.120 --> 4:24:41.480]  to blame our children's bad behavior on the drugs
[4:24:41.480 --> 4:24:47.720]  the truth is it's bad parenting we already have laws in place in this
[4:24:47.720 --> 4:24:51.800]  country to protect me and you and our kids
[4:24:51.800 --> 4:24:55.400]  if a person commits a crime of violence there's a law in place
[4:24:55.400 --> 4:25:00.520]  to put them in jail for that we live in america parents
[4:25:00.520 --> 4:25:05.080]  and if people want to use drugs till their teeth fall out of their head
[4:25:05.080 --> 4:25:08.520]  and and develop this horrible quality of life because
[4:25:08.520 --> 4:25:12.520]  they wouldn't stop they have the right to be miserable
[4:25:12.520 --> 4:25:16.120]  now if they get up out of that drug induced
[4:25:16.120 --> 4:25:21.640]  state and go and commit a crime put them in jail for that crime
[4:25:21.640 --> 4:25:28.600]  but not the drug he's right parents teach your kids the truth about drugs
[4:25:28.600 --> 4:25:40.040]  love peace and never get busted
[4:25:40.040 --> 4:25:44.280]  there is a former cop put up a website that tells drug dealers and drug
[4:25:44.280 --> 4:25:47.480]  smugglers how to get away with their crimes correct
[4:25:47.480 --> 4:25:50.920]  right he's a former cop who is against the war on drugs thinks it's a bad idea
[4:25:50.920 --> 4:25:55.400]  but i mean it's just vile i mean these people are just vile it gets worse and
[4:25:55.400 --> 4:25:59.800]  worse
[4:25:59.800 --> 4:26:05.480]  and sometimes body wires come in the form of a book
[4:26:05.480 --> 4:26:12.200]  this one's 30 off by the way all right folks uh this is our final segment in
[4:26:12.200 --> 4:26:15.880]  overdrive with our uh guest and uh you know what
[4:26:15.880 --> 4:26:18.920]  uh barry i gotta say i've run into a lot of folks i think are one of the few
[4:26:18.920 --> 4:26:21.880]  people who i can actually get since you live here in austin now to sit in on
[4:26:21.880 --> 4:26:25.640]  the show sometimes uh guest host it when i'm out and
[4:26:25.640 --> 4:26:29.720]  you know i haven't intended to do a tv network other than my own show that
[4:26:29.720 --> 4:26:32.200]  we're developing this for addition network and cable
[4:26:32.200 --> 4:26:36.600]  the next a few months uh but this is kind of the prototype in here
[4:26:36.600 --> 4:26:40.120]  but uh i just right now want to extend the opportunity
[4:26:40.120 --> 4:26:43.400]  in the next few weeks to get you to come in once a week or something and do a
[4:26:43.400 --> 4:26:47.880]  two or three hour once a week show just so you learn the ropes because uh i want
[4:26:47.880 --> 4:26:51.160]  to get you involved with the team hey i'd be honored you're a fascinating man
[4:26:51.160 --> 4:26:54.520]  you got a crew that's magnificent here candy and i
[4:26:54.520 --> 4:26:58.280]  refresh we've been in a lot of studios and we'd love to be a part of it it's
[4:26:58.280 --> 4:27:00.680]  great well we're just getting started and uh so
[4:27:00.680 --> 4:27:05.000]  this is very exciting we'll definitely get something uh done on this
[4:27:05.000 --> 4:27:08.840]  um there are so many things i haven't gone over so many things i know that you
[4:27:08.840 --> 4:27:12.520]  haven't gone over we've covered a lot uh but in closing uh any
[4:27:12.520 --> 4:27:15.240]  other points you want to make things you think are important
[4:27:15.240 --> 4:27:20.840]  and uh then the cps issue the the tearing up families in the drug war
[4:27:20.840 --> 4:27:24.520]  i can talk about that uh it still makes me teary eyed
[4:27:24.520 --> 4:27:28.360]  i'm okay i mean i understand post-traumatic stress syndrome somewhat
[4:27:28.360 --> 4:27:31.400]  you know it affects some people worse than others
[4:27:31.400 --> 4:27:35.000]  i think i have a touch of that because it's been 13 14 years and i still have
[4:27:35.000 --> 4:27:38.760]  nightmares from it i'm okay you know it hasn't harmed me well they call it
[4:27:38.760 --> 4:27:41.640]  post-traumatic but it's doing things that are immoral
[4:27:41.640 --> 4:27:44.920]  affects you that's that but but but now the cure is doing things that are
[4:27:44.920 --> 4:27:49.400]  moral go ahead so the eyes of those kids looking at me
[4:27:49.400 --> 4:27:54.280]  what's going on scared to death they've been trained cops are good
[4:27:54.280 --> 4:27:59.400]  yet they see me taking the parents away and we always had a lady there you know
[4:27:59.400 --> 4:28:02.360]  to deal with the kids would you plant drugs in those cases
[4:28:02.360 --> 4:28:06.920]  yes good god how do they morally do that
[4:28:06.920 --> 4:28:10.280]  i don't know so these cps workers will then take the children a lot of times
[4:28:10.280 --> 4:28:14.440]  they never went back to their parents right to the tune of now candy was you
[4:28:14.440 --> 4:28:18.440]  know got the new statistic there's two million kids now
[4:28:18.440 --> 4:28:21.640]  without one or both parents because they're sitting out of drug
[4:28:21.640 --> 4:28:25.960]  crime in a cage he but he really thought he was doing the right thing no no i
[4:28:25.960 --> 4:28:28.760]  understand listen i don't ever judge people
[4:28:28.760 --> 4:28:33.800]  oh i know that for bad things they've done if they wake up to it and then
[4:28:33.800 --> 4:28:37.160]  not just say i was wrong but then go and fight against it that's right i mean
[4:28:37.160 --> 4:28:40.760]  that the soul of tarsus went and hunted down christians and killed him and
[4:28:40.760 --> 4:28:44.280]  tortured him and crucified him and then he had this epiphany on the on the road
[4:28:44.280 --> 4:28:47.800]  to Damascus and became you know just an amazing person against evil
[4:28:47.800 --> 4:28:50.760]  so so a lot of times a lot of times the greatest
[4:28:50.760 --> 4:28:53.400]  soldiers against tyranny are those that have been in the belly of the beast
[4:28:53.400 --> 4:28:56.760]  that's that's actually who we need in fact i want to put the call out to
[4:28:56.760 --> 4:28:59.560]  others out there watching who've been serving evil who've been in denial
[4:28:59.560 --> 4:29:02.920]  that have this horrible feeling in their heart and soul you can get rid of that
[4:29:02.920 --> 4:29:07.080]  it can stop when you stop the denial and really become a good person
[4:29:07.080 --> 4:29:11.560]  absolutely it's never too late to change they say you can't teach an old dog
[4:29:11.560 --> 4:29:16.120]  new tricks that's a lie you have a will and you can switch your mind and switch
[4:29:16.120 --> 4:29:20.920]  your actions overnight i did once i realized and candy started
[4:29:20.920 --> 4:29:25.000]  pointing these things out to me um you know i switched and then i was
[4:29:25.000 --> 4:29:29.800]  lucky enough to have this opportunity to to be able to produce these films and
[4:29:29.800 --> 4:29:34.200]  then now do copbusters not everybody has that opportunity but everybody can
[4:29:34.200 --> 4:29:37.000]  change oh everybody do something everybody can do a youtube
[4:29:37.000 --> 4:29:40.440]  channel everybody can we good people have to become vocal
[4:29:40.440 --> 4:29:43.240]  and we have great tools as you said the internet and other things to do that or
[4:29:43.240 --> 4:29:46.680]  starting a local radio show i tell folks if you have to go by time you know
[4:29:46.680 --> 4:29:49.640]  sixty seventy a hundred bucks an hour on some local station on the weekend
[4:29:49.640 --> 4:29:52.360]  after a few months you'll have an audience that tunes in you can get a few
[4:29:52.360 --> 4:29:56.520]  sponsors fund yourself that way access tv was born here in austin that's how i
[4:29:56.520 --> 4:29:59.560]  started 13 years ago but but but flesh that out just for a few more
[4:29:59.560 --> 4:30:05.000]  minutes and then we're gonna plug the film and in this uh again about the cps
[4:30:05.000 --> 4:30:08.920]  and what was like seeing this well i know what it's like for my kids to be
[4:30:08.920 --> 4:30:11.480]  separated from me through a divorce now we
[4:30:11.480 --> 4:30:15.000]  eventually won all of our kids can and i have all four of them
[4:30:15.000 --> 4:30:18.840]  but i remember i would see the look in my daughter's eyes like
[4:30:18.840 --> 4:30:23.240]  daddy how come i can't come see you and then i would
[4:30:23.240 --> 4:30:26.840]  you know remember the kids that
[4:30:27.560 --> 4:30:30.840]  that i saw that with that i did that too
[4:30:30.840 --> 4:30:34.200]  and you know i left their house but you know they're
[4:30:34.200 --> 4:30:37.960]  they're in their teenage years right now but that that didn't go away
[4:30:37.960 --> 4:30:41.880]  it's terrorizing i mean i'm a big old guy and i was scary then
[4:30:41.880 --> 4:30:45.720]  and so were the people i worked with and it was it was scary to watch us come
[4:30:45.720 --> 4:30:48.920]  crashing through your door i remember watching men pee on themselves
[4:30:48.920 --> 4:30:53.080]  grown men the fathers in sheer terror just
[4:30:53.080 --> 4:30:57.320]  and and and we thought it was funny you know the videographer that was with us
[4:30:57.320 --> 4:31:01.320]  filming the raids for legal purposes we would go back
[4:31:01.320 --> 4:31:06.360]  to the the office and laugh about how scared they were
[4:31:06.360 --> 4:31:09.720]  you've seen the footage of them strip searching some woman
[4:31:09.720 --> 4:31:13.240]  who called the police and she's screaming crying as they're pulling her
[4:31:13.240 --> 4:31:17.480]  panties off and the cops are laughing they're sick
[4:31:17.480 --> 4:31:21.160]  we have sick men in law enforcement well that's the thing about evil
[4:31:21.160 --> 4:31:24.920]  is that it starts slow but once you commit and make a joke about it it just
[4:31:24.920 --> 4:31:27.880]  gets worse and worse and you go right off a cliff
[4:31:27.880 --> 4:31:32.920]  that's right yeah so well this has been one of the most amazing interviews and
[4:31:32.920 --> 4:31:36.600]  i don't i don't say this for most yes this has been an amazing
