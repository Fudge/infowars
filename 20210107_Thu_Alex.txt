[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Feed me audio whenever you're ready to take me live.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  The United States is in a civil war.
[00:19.000 --> 00:21.000]  We've been in a civil war for years.
[00:21.000 --> 00:28.000]  Multinational corporations, allied with the Communist Chinese, are attempting a takeover of the United States.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  And yesterday, I would estimate over a million people showed up in Washington, D.C. total.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  300,000 to 400,000 total ended up marching to the Capitol.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  And things got out of hand with any large group of people.
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.000]  That's going to happen sometimes.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  It was not adequately staffed with police.
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.000]  And we have massive evidence mounting.
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  Incredible evidence we're going to lay out here today that Antifa said weeks ago,
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  they were going to be at the Capitol dressed as patriots and they were going to provocateur action.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  And then we have known high-level Antifa shooting the videos of people being shot,
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  people being killed, and what happened inside.
[01:09.000 --> 01:16.000]  We got secret documents three years ago from 2015 where Obama planned martial law in Maryland
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  by staging Antifa triggering black Americans to riot, but they were unsuccessful.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  So they tried this before, but the evidence is mounting.
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  And we know the names of the individuals, the groups, because they bragged weeks before they were going to come here.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  Turns out before Trump was even giving a speech, the Capitol police are aware of this,
[01:36.000 --> 01:44.000]  that's been in their communications, that they were here at 9.10 in the morning running around violently
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  with elbow pads and knee pads, kind of in their own unofficial uniforms, posing as patriots,
[01:49.000 --> 01:58.000]  screaming F Antifa, F Antifa, which is a proud boys chant,
[01:58.000 --> 02:04.000]  so that they could then establish that with the police that the Trump supporters were going to attack.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  Then when tens of thousands of Trump supporters started showing up before Trump
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  but even finished a speech before I got there, they then led charges in attacking the riot police
[02:13.000 --> 02:22.000]  and were successful like a detonator, a cap on a cartridge of a firearm round to detonate
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  a small part of the crowd to fire a political bullet into the Capitol.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  That's a allegory, that's an analogy, but that's where all the evidence is.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  So much evidence, it makes my head spin.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  And we're going to be putting it on here today.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  Antifa said they were coming here.
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  We're going to show you the post, got a journalist who's been following very closely.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  They said they were coming here to run a false flag attack.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  I then also have a lot of law enforcement sources and military sources and intelligence sources.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  They've also been talking to the people inside the Capitol.
[02:54.000 --> 03:00.000]  And I've been given a statement that I'm able to read for you when we come back.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  And this is the limited stage area we have.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  Sun's a little bit behind me right now, so it's hard for me to read,
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  but we'll do that soon the sun won't be on the back of my face,
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  and I'll be able to feel a better breakdown for you.
[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  But we're out here right above the Capitol where this historic event happened.
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  Chuck E. Schumer's calling it an attack on Pearl Harbor, calling themselves heroes,
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  even though they killed four patriots.
[03:22.000 --> 03:23.000]  We now know how.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  Hordily, several were shot to death.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  Others were thrown by police off the 35-foot balconies to their deaths.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  We'll also show you that footage.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  So viewer discretion is advised.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  And then Owen Schreuer is going to be hosting the fourth hour and part of the war room.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  I'm going to go down with a live Skype feed while he's hosting,
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  and I'm going to be down there on the ground giving you a tour of the Capitol area.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  We were under curfew, martial law, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.,
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  but we're, quote, media, First Amendment, so we're essential personnel.
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  That's why all citizens should say, I am First Amendment.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  I am a journal.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  Start your own organization.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  And you are just as important as M4 Wars or the New York Times as Matt Drudge
[04:09.000 --> 04:14.000]  before he turned to the New World Order would so amply say.
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  So this is a major crossroads.
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  The way they shape this narrative, the way they put this propaganda out,
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  is going to have a massive effect into the future.
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  I want to lay out first what really happened yesterday from my perspective.
[04:31.000 --> 04:37.000]  Then I'm going to lay out clear evidence that Antifo as a history of false flagging and provocaturing
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  came here and did this.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  And then what the system is planning to do out of this crisis
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  and how we can counter it and has Trump really conceding
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  will also take your calls and a lot more today.
[04:48.000 --> 04:54.000]  I'm Alex Jones live from right outside the DC Capitol in the center of DC.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  Stay with us.

[06:26.000 --> 06:44.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  So much Intel's coming in documented with photos and videos and Capitol police,
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  transmission chatter and everything else that it's just overwhelming.
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  Antifook came here on record by name, many of them, their organizers and said,
[06:59.000 --> 07:04.000]  we're going to dress up like Trump supporters and cause a crisis and pose as Proud Boys.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  They couldn't beat the Proud Boys in a fight.
[07:06.000 --> 07:14.000]  They simply stole their identity and then triggered real red blooded Americans charging and invading the Capitol,
[07:14.000 --> 07:20.000]  just like you'd fire off a gun behind cows that are asleep at night to make them stampede.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  But it's the person that fires the gun off that caused the stampede.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  I've got more Intel coming in on that.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  I'll get into that coming up and we have a special guest in studio.
[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  Also, Owen Shroyer is going to be here and so much more.
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.000]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  We just joined us.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  It is January 7th on this Thursday.
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  Hard to believe here we are 2021.
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  And the big question is, has President Trump conceded?
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  Well, let me go ahead and read you the president's tweet.
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  And you can decide for yourself what he had to say about that here in just a moment.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  But this is the tweet.
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  This is the tweet that they deleted.
[08:03.000 --> 08:12.000]  These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously and viciously
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  script away from great patriots who've been badly and unfairly treated for so long.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  Go home with love and peace.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  Remember this day forever.
[08:23.000 --> 08:27.000]  That is beautifully said.
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  And it's true.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  But even if it was a lie, he's the president.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  This is a modern bulletin board, a communication system.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  President Trump should be able to communicate.
[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  President Trump should be able to talk to the American people.
[08:43.000 --> 08:59.000]  Oh, but the Trump Twitter, the Trump Twitter where he concedes that is allowed to stay up there.
[08:59.000 --> 09:06.000]  Where he says, well, I don't accept the results.
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.000]  But I'm going to go along with the orderly transfer to Joe Biden and give him the Pentagon briefings
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  and give him the keys to the White House and all the rest of it.
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  Because, as we told you last night, confirmed this morning, they were planning the 25th amendment with Pence and the rest of them
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  to pull Trump out of the White House saying he's mentally ill because he doesn't like a communist Chinese takeover
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  and because he challenged them when we have the fraud and the evidence pulling the black boxes out,
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  the suitcases, crabbing the machines when they kick everybody out, saying they're not counting
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  and then counting in real time admittedly as giant spikes for Joe Biden in Michigan, in Georgia, in Pennsylvania
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  and everywhere else where they did this.
[09:45.000 --> 09:49.000]  I mean, this is ridiculous how obvious this is.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  And then President Trump put this video out, which within 30 minutes of Trump putting it out,
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  everybody had it on their phones, everybody said Trump says go home.
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  I'd already left, told folks to go home, trying to stop what was happening with the anti-viprocateurs.
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  And I watched hundreds of thousands of people dwindle down to about 30,000 within minutes of it coming out.
[10:09.000 --> 10:10.000]  I watched it.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.000]  Trump says everybody should leave.
[10:12.000 --> 10:13.000]  I'd already left.
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  And then the time I got up here on this rooftop, right above the Capitol, I watched 90% leave.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  Twitter didn't want that.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  Twitter wanted to blame Trump.
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  The corporate media was saying Trump orchestrated it.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.000]  He said go do it.
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I tell you this, it's not to brag about my connection to this embattled president
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  because that in the modern world is a millstone around my neck.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  Do you understand what happens?
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  No one would book the ellipse.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  No one would book the other areas.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  No one would pay for it.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  We went and paid for it.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  Well, thank God a donor came in that paid for like 80% of it because it cost close to half a million dollars
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  for all the equipment and all the stages and the rest of it.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  The porta-potties, you name it.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  Even the White House told me three days before, we're going to have you lead the march.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  The secret service before Trump finishes 30 minutes before.
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.000]  So we'll lead you to a point, take you out of the front row and lead you to the place where they want you to start the march
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  and Trump will tell people go and I'm going to meet you at the Capitol.
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.000]  There was a million people outside of the ellipse that was metal detectors folks coming in.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  And so by the time I got out there, 20 minutes, 30 minutes before Trump finished his speech,
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  there were already hundreds of thousands of people ahead of me marching.
[11:29.000 --> 11:36.000]  And before Trump ever took the stage, Antifa dressed up over 100 of them as patriots was there.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  They had the classic elbow pads and knee pads.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  That's the wimps wear.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  Out there screaming F Antifa and Proud Boy Chance to try to blame the Proud Boys.
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  No one's blaming the Proud Boys.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  It wasn't.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  It wasn't the Proud Boys, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  And so the Capitol police at first were nice when people crossed over the little green fence they had around the inauguration stage.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  Folks were supposed to go the other side of the Capitol.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  We had a permit.
[12:01.000 --> 12:03.000]  We had a stage.
[12:03.000 --> 12:04.000]  I get there.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  I see smoke bombs going off.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  I see tear gas.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  I see all this people climbing up the sides of the walls.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  You know, the aliens do it.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  Everybody loves it.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  Instead of doing it at the Capitol, it's called terrorism.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  I don't think it's a good period, but it was still quite the site.
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.000]  People climbing these walls, police throwing people off their deaths.
[12:22.000 --> 12:25.000]  I mean, and I get up on top of pallet of chairs.
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.000]  The video is being uploaded as we speak to Bandai Video.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  And Twitter caught some of it.
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.000]  And I'm like, stop.
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  Don't.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  It's what they want.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  It's going to end the debate.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  We're going to get the 10 day research into this because they didn't want the 10 days of research.
[12:37.000 --> 12:45.000]  They didn't want the 10 days that Ted Cruz wanted of emergency investigation into what really happened.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  Finally putting the evidence on.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  And so by the storming of this, which was started by Antifa, who charged in and attacked the police,
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  that elicited the police to fire tear gas, which is reasonable because they were being attacked.
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.000]  And then the larger crowd got mad because they're patriots and charged in and went into the Capitol.
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  And I'm going to say this now, not to prove I'm right and not to sit here because I'm very sad about all this.
[13:10.000 --> 13:14.000]  I'm going to spend more time next hour on this as we expose Antifa.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  Q is just a nebulous rattlesnake hole to stick your hand down.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  It could be good.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  It could be bad.
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.000]  There could be a diamond down the hole.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  There could be a rattlesnake.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  It's random.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  It's esoteric.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  But it was Q people and this poor woman is a great lady who died.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  We should have a vigil for her tonight.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  In fact, I call for people to come have a vigil.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  What side of the Capitol is that right there?
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  Right in front of the fence.
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  I don't want to go over to the restricted area.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  But as close as you can get to the supposed inauguration stage of the Chinese age of Joe Biden,
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  people should bring flowers and signs.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  This poor woman will tell you her name coming up and there should be a vigil.
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  And we should know her name and we should talk about it.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  And then the other three that have been killed, they're trying to keep their name secret because this was a little baby Tiananmen Square.
[13:58.000 --> 14:05.000]  We're the smarter than us academic, you know, Antifa scumbag devil worshipers manipulated another crowd,
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  they yelled fire in a theater and triggered this once again. No, they're not smart. They're just evil.
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  They've never been brought to justice.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  So they feel like they're invincible, but they are going to get brought to justice.
[14:14.000 --> 14:22.000]  We're going to make sure that the FBI and state police and others investigate Antifa who bragged they came to trigger this when they indict these patriots.
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  They fooled.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  That's fine.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  But they're going to indict your ass too for conspiracy to organize this racketeering because we know who the Antifa are.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  We're going to lay it out.
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.000]  And so this woman on her Twitter will go over and name more coming up.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  It's poor lady.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  She literally was saying, Hey, I'm going there. The storm is here.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  We're going to take this over. We're on orders of the president to do this.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  This is the day they're all going to get Moe.
[14:47.000 --> 14:54.000]  And so she was led in there by Antifa, a 15 year veteran of the Air Force.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  Honorably discharged in intelligence, whole nine yards.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  She sees the Chinese takeover. She sees globalism.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  She sees everything going on.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  T.C. General Flynn is a great guy.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  Patent cue on the head because it gets people involved.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  They wake up at the new water and it's great and it's fun.
[15:08.000 --> 15:18.000]  But then other people can pose as it and say, drive your dump truck into the Hoover Dam or drive your train off the bridge into the hospital ships where Hillary supposedly being held.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  And then finally you see Trump leave office on January 20th.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  Will it be trust the plan then?
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  So I've been nice to Q folks just like General Flynn has.
[15:28.000 --> 15:35.000]  Like, hey, if you got into it, whatever, 4chan, 8chan, following breadcrumbs of a guy that lives in the Philippines and has a pig farm, great.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  I'm just saying the real wars here and Trump's surrounded needs our help.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  And I had to get the, I had to get the stage and the money for everything together because Trump's surrounded and I led the march.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  They got hijacked by Antifa.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  So I'm just saying, if Q was there, I wouldn't talk to him.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[15:53.000 --> 16:05.000]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially if the globalist are successful in killing the dollar.
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food.
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.000]  That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves.
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  It's up to us to become self-sufficient.
[16:23.000 --> 16:31.000]  The globalist are waging siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses, trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches.
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready.
[16:35.000 --> 16:47.000]  Take advantage of a huge final mega sale before prices go up and prepare with Alex.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storeable foods out there.
[16:47.000 --> 16:57.000]  You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in and prepare with Alex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high quality storeable food.
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado, thank you for holding.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  How are you doing, Alex?
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother, how are you?
[17:05.000 --> 17:15.000]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug, that DNA force. I love it. I've been using it quite a while and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day
[17:15.000 --> 17:30.000]  and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  So people might want to take a look at that.
[17:33.000 --> 17:46.000]  What I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[17:46.000 --> 18:04.000]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug.
[18:16.000 --> 18:42.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are here at the epicenter where four U.S. citizens were murdered inside and outside the U.S. Capitol by the paramilitary forces there who were manipulated and triggered by antifa evidences mounting that posed as proud boys so that they would then attack
[18:42.000 --> 18:51.000]  and so they could then trigger part of the crowd, hundreds of thousands already massing, to get a small percentage inside the building.
[18:51.000 --> 19:04.000]  We have a special guest, Taylor Hansen, who's an investigative journalist who actually spoke with and knew Ashley Babbitt and talked to her 30 minutes before she was dead, before she was shot in the neck and killed.
[19:04.000 --> 19:17.000]  We also have all of his research into antifa and we have another investigative journalist who works for a very big TV station who's making a documentary about antifa, how they were going to come here and do this from all over the country.
[19:17.000 --> 19:28.000]  She's separately contacted me. She's coming up here later today as well. But let me read you some of the intel that some of our folks got us here in D.C. This is from a lot of different sources.
[19:28.000 --> 19:37.000]  Antifa and other organizations promoted, as always, that they would dress in Trump apparel to infiltrate the event with normal activity for them.
[19:37.000 --> 19:46.000]  Members from the security team did an advanced observation of the Capitol grounds prior to Trump even arriving to confirm a stage that was set up for the speak.
[19:46.000 --> 19:59.000]  They did an observation for a group of 100 to 120 folks already assembled chanting F Antifa, dressed in a manner not consistent with that normally seen from Trump supporters.
[19:59.000 --> 20:05.000]  Everyone else who came from the event was at the ellipse waiting for Trump's speech.
[20:05.000 --> 20:18.000]  They all kind of looked like sons of congressmen, sons of Senator Cain was probably there. He's been arrested here doing felony type stuff.
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  In fact, that was Jesse was probably there.
[20:20.000 --> 20:30.000]  F Antifa dressed in a manner not consistent with what normally seen from Trump supporters. Everyone else who came from the event was at the ellipse for Trump's speech.
[20:30.000 --> 20:43.000]  Prior to the Trump even coming on stage, a few protesters most likely stage Antifa were already engaged in confrontation with Capitol police on the Supreme Court side of the Capitol building.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  This initiated prior to Trump even speaking on the march to Capitol.
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  The crowd departed the ellipse.
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.000]  Trump's speech location didn't even arrive until at least an hour following Trump's speech.
[20:55.000 --> 21:08.000]  This was also confirmed by an individual that they interviewed. We interviewed yesterday stating that these folks were the first ones to engage in confrontation with Capitol police and is on air saying, I heard them say it's time.
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  Let's go now.
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.000]  And I interviewed a well known former member of the UFC who I happened to run into.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  I checked out who he is friends with Joe Rogan, my friend.
[21:19.000 --> 21:27.000]  And he said in an incredible interview is on Bandai video, witnesses say that they saw what looked like Antifa starting the attack on police.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  And he said, you know, we're all wearing different outfits. We're all normal guys. Most of us are above 40.
[21:32.000 --> 21:42.000]  And then all of a sudden, you just see all these kind of skinny jeans, metrosexual guys in their combat gear with mask on running and attack all this.
[21:42.000 --> 21:48.000]  And then as soon as they tricked Trump supporters to join them, because the cops started attacking, they pulled out.
[21:48.000 --> 21:54.000]  Which is in their handbooks that we've gotten before from sources in our big article from three years ago.
[21:54.000 --> 21:59.000]  Documents show Obama planned martial law in Maryland 2015. You pull those up.
[21:59.000 --> 22:07.000]  This was also confirmed by an individual that we interviewed yesterday saying these folks were the first ones to engage in confrontation with Capitol police.
[22:07.000 --> 22:22.000]  He's on there saying I heard them say it's time. Let's go now, which is exactly what other witnesses said. Following those initial actions, this man stated that he observed these folks depart after footage of their action was immediately posted to social media and news outlets.
[22:22.000 --> 22:31.000]  Following a rival to the Capitol. And again, that made everybody here at the Capitol think that was happening. So others did it.
[22:31.000 --> 22:39.000]  Following the arrival of the Capitol, several attempts were made from key personalities to deescalate violent actions already taking place.
[22:39.000 --> 22:44.000]  There were no attempts by any law enforcement to stop anyone's freedom of movement around the Capitol building.
[22:44.000 --> 22:51.000]  This is all documented on video to include attempted coordination to get official approval.
[22:51.000 --> 23:02.000]  For myself to gain access to our security guys with the police to a place to address the crowd to ensure that real Trump supporters did not take this moment in a violent direction.
[23:02.000 --> 23:10.000]  We were told if you can't get up there, do it. If you can get up there, do it. I can't give you approval, but we won't stop you either.
[23:10.000 --> 23:19.000]  The timeline obviously doesn't line up. Did some true Trump supporters fall into the psychological herd mob mentality? Absolutely.
[23:19.000 --> 23:29.000]  But they didn't initiate it. I personally did not witness a violent mob. I witnessed American patriots showing up in numbers to assemble unarmed to be heard.
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.000]  The left clearly took advantage of the situation to spin up the narrative to degrade credibility of what happened yesterday.
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  What happened was over 500,000 Americans from all across the country assembled to be heard and were not violent.
[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  But the left and these people always pull their black magic. They pull their dirty stuff.
[23:46.000 --> 23:57.000]  Proud of the crowd even departing with Trump's speech, confirmed reporters were coming in on official police channels that one man was arrested with a firearm around Capitol grounds,
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  and there were violent confrontations happening with Capitol police.
[24:01.000 --> 24:09.000]  So that's what Andy said they were coming to do. They're all trust fund kids, sons of U.S. Senators, sons of Congress people, academics,
[24:09.000 --> 24:17.000]  devil worshiping, child molesting, chai-com loving, America hating, trash of the planet.
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.000]  And the police got attacked. The police got hit. They then came out when the crowd saw that and even said,
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  let's get them. Some patriots responded because they didn't want to be bullied and got suckered into this.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  That's what happened. Trump needs to go on the offense, start exposing this.
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  They were going to take him out with the 25th Amendment, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  They were talking about it last night. We confirmed. I told you that last night this morning was all over the news.
[24:45.000 --> 24:54.000]  If he didn't say, okay, I'll have a peaceful transition of power. Okay, I'll give him to Joe Biden because they will simply stage terror attacks and blame it on us.
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  And that's what I told the Trump administration back in mid-November.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  I talked to the Trump administration back then and I said, you understand that when we get hundreds of thousands of millions to march,
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  and when the evidence of the fraud is documented, what it should is, they're going to stage riots and blame it on us,
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  or detonate truck bombs, or shoot up a church and say, we did it.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  And then I'm here. I know this is going on. My security detail that are great folks, they go check it.
[25:19.000 --> 25:27.000]  They see what goes on. We knew this was happening and we just should have been there. I should have been there instead of at the Trump speech.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  I was tempted to not go to Trump's speech and be at the Capitol. I wanted to race down and not wait for Trump and get to the Capitol.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  That's what my gut told me. And we could have told people that's Antifa. We could have tackled them, hold off their mask.
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  I would have happened to have been arrested and we would have stopped these pieces of filth.
[25:42.000 --> 25:51.000]  And so we've just got to be on our guard every damn time and they just set us up and it's a splendid victory for these trash.
[25:51.000 --> 26:01.000]  And I would guess again, my opinion, because he got arrested trying to attack people and do stuff that Senator Cain, Hillary Clinton's running me,
[26:01.000 --> 26:09.000]  was her son, I bet money. We should check that he was here, but we're going to tell you names of who was here, what they said they would do,
[26:09.000 --> 26:19.000]  how they plan to set us up, how they brag about it online, knowing media is not going to cover it and thinking their censorship of us allows them to carry out these operations.
[26:19.000 --> 26:24.000]  But we're here right above the Capitol where this historic event took place.
[26:24.000 --> 26:31.000]  And I want to salute the probably a million people, conservatively half a million, that came here to D.C. for a third time to say,
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  we don't accept the fraud. The globalists started this fight. They started the Chicom takeover.
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.000]  And the fact that they had their provocateurs trigger this and do this, hey, that's on them.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  And so we're not ashamed of what happened. I'm proud of America and I'm proud of Trump and I'm proud of not conceding and I'm proud of what you've done.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  We'll talk about what comes in the future. We're going to lay out next, though, the proof of anti-fingerprints all over this in their own words.
[26:53.000 --> 27:22.000]  Stay with us on all shows.
[27:23.000 --> 27:31.000]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
[27:31.000 --> 27:43.000]  foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[27:43.000 --> 27:50.000]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can. So help me God.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  Infowars.com, BAM.video.

[28:40.000 --> 28:48.000]  This is naturally occurring. It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.

[29:03.000 --> 29:10.000]  you're forced onto a universal guaranteed income or synoculations and you must pledge allegiance to the leftist globalist system.
[29:10.000 --> 29:23.000]  That's why it's important to pray to God, be politically active and get prepared for self-defense and to be able to store food and other emergency products that you and your family need so you're not dependent on the system.

[30:13.000 --> 30:25.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[30:25.000 --> 30:44.000]  So history is happening right now. Decades of globalist manipulation is coming together to overthrow the United States and we are here witnessing the globalist counter strike to Trump, Bolsonaro and others.
[30:44.000 --> 30:57.000]  Again, patriots don't burn down police stations. They don't shoot cops. They don't burn down public housing. What happened here? You had a million people probably hundreds of thousands marched down here from Trump's beach
[30:57.000 --> 31:05.000]  and you had Antifa on record saying we're coming in uniforms dressed like proud boys. We're going to attack the police and they did it.
[31:05.000 --> 31:14.000]  And we knew they were doing it and I was so busy at the Trump event that we got sucker punched. Pure evil, but we need everybody to call their congressman.
[31:14.000 --> 31:20.000]  We need everybody to get these articles, these videos, these reports out. We need to expose this and get Trump on the offense exposing it.
[31:20.000 --> 31:27.000]  And we need to talk about Ashley Babbitt and we need to talk about how she was executed with three other Americans.
[31:27.000 --> 31:35.000]  We'll just roll that footage and show you police punching people in the face that were climbing up the side of the Capitol, falling 35 feet to their death.
[31:35.000 --> 31:44.000]  I mean, this was absolutely insane. Owen Shroyer is here riding shotgun as well with us. We're about to go to Taylor Hansen.
[31:44.000 --> 31:48.000]  I knew who he was. I know he's been in the war room, but really impressed with his reportage.
[31:48.000 --> 31:59.000]  Now, he was warning of this with Antifa and now it was all coming up. So, Mr. Hansen, give us your breakdown of this and then we'll go into more detail next segment.
[31:59.000 --> 32:07.000]  We'll talk about how you were talking with Ms. Babbitt right before she died and just how Antifa got the footage of her being killed.
[32:07.000 --> 32:17.000]  I mean, all of this is absolutely incredible. They couldn't beat us ideologically, so they had to come pose as us to then put their own activities on the President Trump.
[32:17.000 --> 32:24.000]  They did fool some folks to working with them. I tried to stop it. You tried to stop it. So go ahead and lay out what you witnessed yesterday.
[32:24.000 --> 32:30.000]  Absolutely. I mean, I'll start it off by saying it was a huge setup. 100%. It was just one big setup.
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  And there's plenty of reasons why I want to touch on someone named John Sullivan.
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.000]  John Sullivan is kind of where I started my investigative journalism career.
[32:38.000 --> 32:44.000]  He is an activist that is known for something called Insurgents USA back in Utah where I am actually located at.
[32:44.000 --> 32:47.000]  And I began infiltrating him a few months ago and his movement.
[32:47.000 --> 32:54.000]  And they were involved in a Provo shooting where they actually shot a man driving a truck as he was driving by.
[32:54.000 --> 33:02.000]  And John Sullivan actually got his own angle. He was in the Capitol at the time where actually Babbitt was shot. He was behind me.
[33:02.000 --> 33:08.000]  And he's now on Twitter bragging about it, getting this clip, and he's actually making fun of her death.
[33:08.000 --> 33:14.000]  So he's not even trying to hide that he's Antifa. And this is just one of the many, many examples I have.
[33:14.000 --> 33:21.000]  I mean, I've recognized multiple journalists, so-called. You've got these fake Antifa press from Portland because I mean, that's my second home.
[33:21.000 --> 33:25.000]  And I've confronted them. I walked right up to them and said, oh, hey, you're from Portland, right? And they said, yeah.
[33:25.000 --> 33:33.000]  There's been Antifa scattered throughout the entire protest. The first people to attack was Antifa provocateurs.
[33:33.000 --> 33:43.000]  Well, the fellow that shot the video of the cop killing Mrs. Babbitt, he has ended by himself and has been arrested for staging riots in Portland.
[33:43.000 --> 33:50.000]  Yeah, keep in mind too that, you know, every time we have these events in D.C., you always see Antifa and BLM out on the streets.
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.000]  They are not anywhere to be seen in this week because they're all wearing Trump gear. They're all posing as journalists.
[33:57.000 --> 34:03.000]  They're just infiltrating all the Trump stuff because they have no effect now dressing in all black with black block going around.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  They get their ass kicked by Proud Boys. The police are sick of them. So now they pretend to be patriots. They infiltrate and then they cause all this disruption.
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.000]  And I think that Taylor, the point that you're making is so key here, he's bragging about it because this is their victory.
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  Like, oh, we just got one of you killed and you did it to yourself.
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  And they blamed all that on Trump and America. This is a devastating victory.
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.000]  We thought of ourselves so next time they don't get away with this, they had a huge psychological war.
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  If you study the British Navy or the Romans or anybody, lots of armies would stage atrocities and blame it on the other enemy.
[34:32.000 --> 34:36.000]  It's called a false flag because you run up somebody else's flag and then commit a crime.
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.000]  Yeah, it's Hitler and the Reichstag. And so they did it. I don't know if this individual did it, but they all bragged.
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  We're coming by the hundreds. We're going to dress like you and they staged the attack while we were down there with Trump and already had it going by the time I got here.
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.000]  It's unbelievable. So start laying out what they said they do, how they came to town.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  I mean, it's all on record. Your Twitter is just documenting this.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  I mean, because they've been saying they're going to come in town dressed as Trump supporters.
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  Backward Trump hats, cut off brown shirts is what they were saying.
[35:03.000 --> 35:09.000]  Basically, they dress out so they're very easy to be noticed so they're not in the crowd, really.
[35:09.000 --> 35:10.000]  I mean, they are Trump supporters.
[35:10.000 --> 35:19.000]  And by the way, send to my crew because we don't have all our computers and stuff. The original footage before Trump, that even said he was marching here, of them kind of in their elbow pads, their knee pads.
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.000]  The first video put out clashes with police. You can see they're all dressed the same. It's the same group.
[35:24.000 --> 35:30.000]  That's what our witnesses said they saw go in, triggered the police to attack the crowd. As soon as that happened, they left.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  Well, hell, and they weren't even inconspicuous about it either.
[35:32.000 --> 35:41.000]  So all the Portland people, they actually have stands because they're so well-funded. I mean, they have over $1.5 billion in their bail fund already and just keeps growing.
[35:41.000 --> 35:47.000]  But they're so well-funded that they hand out new gas masks, they hand out helmets, every single direct action.
[35:47.000 --> 35:50.000]  So every single night in Portland, they riot, they are getting brand new gear.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  And Black Lives Matter got $10.6 billion.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  Exactly. And where did that go? The Democratic Party, the ones that put them there in the first place.
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  But with this gear, they all wear these pink face masks, and they're very easy to distinguish, and they wore them all here.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  That's how I recognize them. I walked right up to them and I was hauling them by name.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  Again, I'm not at the network. I'm sure they've got it, but it's the first footage of the riot police up against the Capitol.
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  And you see the guys are all kind of dressed the same. They're wearing gray. They've got elbow pads and knee pads.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  That was the first thing to come out. You were there. How did they then trick the Patriots to join them?
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.000]  I mean, because they were staging a photo shoot at first. That's what she was doing.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  They were actually staging a photo shoot trying to get an Antifa provocateur dressed as a Trump supporter or punching a cop.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  And he actually was the one that started it.
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.000]  Well, and let's remember too, when all the Antifa violence was happening over the summer, you had videos where you can clearly see,
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  okay, there's a crowd gathering, but it hasn't really gotten too violent.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  And then what happens? Like clockwork every time.
[36:44.000 --> 36:52.000]  Two or three people dressed in black block like Antifa's uniform with one as the photographer, which you've documented on your Twitter account now from this week.
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  One is the photographer, two of them with a skateboard to Molotov. The guy with a skateboard starts it, bashes in the police window.
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  The second guy comes in, Molotov cocktail throws in the cop car, cop car lights up.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  Then the crowd goes next level starts destroying the cop car, hopping on it, doing thing.
[37:05.000 --> 37:14.000]  The three people, the one that took the photo and the two that let the car on fire, they then take off and they've now successfully launched a violent event.
[37:14.000 --> 37:23.000]  We got documents three years ago from 2015, again, headline documents show Obama planned martial law with Antifa in Maryland where they coordinate.
[37:23.000 --> 37:29.000]  We attacked here. You do this, we do that. Let's try to get the black people to do this. They just did the same damn thing right here.
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.000]  Yeah. And again, it just shows that they are, I mean, the people that do this are probably not that bright.
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  I mean, I don't know.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  But they're following organized crime script.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  Somebody, there are leaders, you can identify them when you're out on the scene by the ones that are saying, hey, don't talk to media.
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  Hey, go this way, go that way. You can document this if you stream live.
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  That's why they don't like it when we stream live and they ban people that do from these events because you catch them in the act.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  Well, they were jamming. They were jamming. Somebody was.
[37:53.000 --> 38:02.000]  Well, exactly what you said, too, is that it's a reaction. They start it, they leave and then they make the Trump supporters feel betrayed because, you know, the police, we back the blue.
[38:02.000 --> 38:08.000]  And then I've never seen so much force in my life, you know, covering these riots for five months. I've never seen so much force used.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  Yeah, they've got a perimeter. They've got a perimeter on the Capitol here that they haven't had a perimeter like that anywhere in D.C.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  Nowhere during the summer riots in 2020, which they say, oh, those are peaceful protests.
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.000]  You look at the aerial footage from D.C. this summer, it's like, it's like a war zone, the whole town in flames.
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  You didn't have that here. There was some property destruction at the Capitol, obviously the, the, the strife with police.
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  But I mean, to sit here and say, oh, that's a violent siege, they say siege, siege.
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.000]  No, they're sieging us. We're under siege. They're stealing our elections and people going into the Capitol, they say is a siege.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  So it just shows how, like you said, Taylor, it's all a big setup.
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  And so is the election in Georgia. Oh, really? You really believe it was that tight?
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  You really believe it's 50%, 50% right up to the final vote, which magically puts the Democrats?
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.000]  No, that's the Chinese running the voting machines, getting us amped up, but staging the steel.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  Of course they're going to steal it, but staging the steel perfectly so that you see it, think you had a chance and then recognize the seal.
[39:03.000 --> 39:10.000]  And then so it's all a setup. The child I'm setting us up with the major intel with the stolen elections and then antifa grassroots level,
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  staging violence to then set Trump supporters up against the police.
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  The goal has caused a civil war, but let's just pull back from this.
[39:17.000 --> 39:23.000]  We need to talk about talking points based in truth for the president, for America, for the world, because we don't have any
[39:23.000 --> 39:33.000]  We don't have any patriot communications. The president's been cut off, basically. The White House is listening to us. And it's not because we're powerful. It's because Trump is surrounded.
[39:33.000 --> 39:39.000]  Okay. And I keep telling everybody, you think Q's great. You don't have to do anything. Trust the plan. Everything's wonderful.
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.000]  That's what's gotten us into this position. Okay. And I'm not bashing if you were a Q person.
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  I'm just telling you now that you have to listen to the talking points.
[39:48.000 --> 39:55.000]  We can discuss who was behind this. We have to get Trump moving now on the offense instead of being on the defense.
[39:55.000 --> 40:02.000]  Fox has betrayed President Trump, as I predicted they would. They've always been part of the establishment, and it's only going to get worse.
[40:02.000 --> 40:12.000]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for second term on the 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[40:12.000 --> 40:18.000]  They're going to explode gas prices. They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S.
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic domination. This is economic war. We are being consolidated. We are being taken over.
[40:26.000 --> 40:39.000]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.000]  This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is. Cloud Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is.
[40:46.000 --> 41:14.000]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years. No small businesses will be there. This is a master plan. Say no.
[41:14.000 --> 41:26.000]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bioweapons that are super deadly.
[41:26.000 --> 41:35.000]  And now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it just like newborn babies. They give vaccines. They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die.
[41:35.000 --> 41:44.000]  And that's on the record. It does that. Guillain-Marais, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you, safe and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory.
[41:44.000 --> 41:56.000]  And then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe. They do it.
[41:56.000 --> 42:06.000]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best selling products and forwards are no longer available. And I thought that pollen block might be gone forever.
[42:06.000 --> 42:19.000]  But after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us. The rest they hope in a few months comes in. It's proprietary system using specially fed quail and their eggs.

[44:11.000 --> 44:21.000]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[44:21.000 --> 44:31.000]  Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:31.000 --> 44:43.000]  Okay, so I want to lay out the historic events that took place yesterday that we were in the middle of. If you want to see the footage where I tried early on to stop the crowd from following Antifa and failed because it was just so many hundreds of thousands.
[44:43.000 --> 44:53.000]  They couldn't even hear me on the bullhorn. That's going up at Band-Aid video. Rob is almost done going through all the footage. We have hours and hours of footage. It's hard to find those little pieces, but he's found them.
[44:53.000 --> 45:04.000]  So those are going up because mainstream media saying I called for this. I did this. Trump did this. Trump told me his campaign at the White House. Folks wouldn't met at the White House.
[45:04.000 --> 45:12.000]  I'll leave it at that. I didn't go. They said he wants you to leave it. Make sure it's peaceful to everybody. So we have me going. This is peaceful. We are peaceful.
[45:12.000 --> 45:18.000]  We get down there and it's already all hell's all broken loose because Antifa set us up.
[45:18.000 --> 45:26.000]  But talking to Taylor Hansen and Owen Schreuer here, we're going to get into big picture. Has Trump really conceded in 14 days or whatever it is?
[45:26.000 --> 45:31.000]  How big a deal is this? What is Joe Biden going to do? Can we still fight back?
[45:31.000 --> 45:38.000]  I trust the plan of never giving in to tyranny and praying to God and admitting how much trouble we're in. That's how we dig out of this.
[45:38.000 --> 45:49.000]  That's the real plan. God's plan. Christ's plan. So both of you guys, let's get into this poor lady. Let's get into Ashley Babbitt and what happened to her dying in red, white and blue.
[45:49.000 --> 45:55.000]  A decorated veteran of the Air Force and being gunned down, being executed and that's sickening footage.
[45:55.000 --> 46:03.000]  Yeah, I mean, I actually had an opportunity to briefly talk to Ashley. I mean, to say about 10, 15, 20 minutes prior to her execution.
[46:03.000 --> 46:09.000]  And all she had to say was she was there to save the Republic and uphold the Constitution. That doesn't sound like a terrorist to me.
[46:09.000 --> 46:17.000]  That doesn't sound like what the media is framing this. And if you think about it this way, Ashley Babbitt bled out in a red, white and blue Trump flag.
[46:17.000 --> 46:23.000]  She died wearing the same colors that she wore on her arm for her country for 14 years. She went on four deployments doing that.
[46:23.000 --> 46:28.000]  The same people that sent her there are the same people that killed her.
[46:28.000 --> 46:39.000]  You're absolutely right. Continue. It's just and I can't even you can't even wrap your head around it about what these people are doing.
[46:39.000 --> 46:45.000]  You know, they frame this narrative that this woman is a terrorist. When in reality, she's a war hero.
[46:45.000 --> 46:51.000]  This woman served her country. She served a red, white and blue. She served our Constitution. She loves this country.
[46:51.000 --> 46:56.000]  But what is the media framing her out to be? They're saying she's a monster. They declared her dead in the ambulance.
[46:56.000 --> 47:03.000]  I watched the life drain out of her eyes while there were three special technicians that knew how to administer the right aid, but they didn't do anything.
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.000]  They stood by. They carried her off like a dead dog or a pile of garbage.
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.000]  Yeah. And you know, I'm not going to pontificate redundantly on the double standard that we're witnessing here.
[47:12.000 --> 47:17.000]  But it is incredible that we still haven't identified the shooter even though we have the video.
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  We've seen the videos. We have the video at Band-Aid video.
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.000]  If you want to see the actual guy pulling the trigger, killing her, executing her, everyone that seen the video agrees it was an execution.
[47:25.000 --> 47:26.000]  He could have handled the same way.
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.000]  And nobody likes watching George Floyd die. And when I saw it, I said it was terrible, but they didn't even know what they were doing.
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.000]  He died of a heart attack from drug overdose. This is premeditated and it's a black dude killing a white lady.
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.000]  And I don't think the black dude killed her because she was white. He was scared. It's hysteria. It's still wrong.
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  But imagine if a white dude was shooting a black lady, the cities would be burning.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  And again, that is the double standard of Antifa and BLM. Most folks at BLM aren't black.
[47:50.000 --> 47:57.000]  It's the left and communist posing that they represent black people out burning down America, shooting people randomly at checkpoints.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  And then nobody's name that's killed has ever heard. That's the double standard we're talking about.
[48:01.000 --> 48:06.000]  Well, and it's frustrating too because I was watching news and doing some stuff before I went to bed last night to try to get more intel.
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  And I still didn't even get the information until Taylor told me this morning that actually four people died last night.
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  We only know one of them. Four people died. Many at the hands of police.
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.000]  Normally it's, oh, police are bad.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  Let's show the footage of him punching the guy off right now and he just falls to his death.
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  But notice how the police aren't violent.
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  So it shows you that the establishment is an occupying force that's only oppressing the political.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  When the police work as communists and follow the new order's orders, they are good.
[48:31.000 --> 48:36.000]  When they do something else, the system doesn't like they demonize the police, but only to control them.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  They didn't care about George Floyd. And again, the police the other day are not even the bad ones in this.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  Antifa came in. They had the capital understaffed on purpose. You can see the setup.
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.000]  They attacked. The police finally pushed back. Antifa pulls out.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  The police attacked the Patriots. The Patriots attack. And it was all a setup.
[48:53.000 --> 49:00.000]  They beautifully played. We need this to be investigated by state police, by citizens, by grand juries, by investigative journalists.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  The FBI is not going to do it. I mean, I bet Bill Barr was probably in command of this.
[49:03.000 --> 49:04.000]  Well, and the state police...
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  Because you know Antifa works for the deep state.
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  Well, and the state police aren't going to do anything either. They're all funded by Soros and they have Soros DA's.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  So they know there's nothing that's going to be done. But you know, think about this.
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[49:16.000 --> 49:23.000]  Kyle Rittenhouse fires off shots into a crowd of BLM Antifa. He hits three criminals, including a pedophile.
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.000]  I guarantee you, I would bet that another one of the four people that died, I bet there was another veteran,
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  you couldn't just swing a stick and not hit a veteran that was inside the Capitol yesterday.
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  So just think about that. You fire into a crowd of transporters. You hit veterans. You hit mothers.
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  You hit good patriots, good people. You fire into the crowd of the Antifa, the BLM.
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.000]  You hit three criminals, including a pedophile. So I mean, it just shows you...
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  I mean, I'm not saying any of it's good. All of it's bad.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  But it's a double standard. Chuck E. Schumer is calling it Pearl Harbor. In fact, cue that up.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  Chuck E. Schumer is calling it Pearl Harbor when they killed four people.
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.000]  It wasn't Japanese bombers blowing up battleships and killing thousands of people, 3,000 people.
[50:02.000 --> 50:09.000]  It was literally the police getting manipulated by Antifa to then attack a peaceful crowd.
[50:09.000 --> 50:13.000]  The crowd's pissed. They go in. Sure, maybe they get in trouble.
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.000]  They get fined. They go to jail for ransacking things.
[50:16.000 --> 50:20.000]  Those gutter rats in the old days would have been tarred and feathered. And I'm not calling for violence.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  But you've got those globalists that have been raping this country.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  And now people show up. They kill four Americans, including an unarmed woman.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  They throw people off parapets to their death. And now they're Pearl Harbor survivors.
[50:32.000 --> 50:43.000]  Here's Chuck E. Schumer.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  See, I don't have any audio. Yeah, that's weird how they do.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  Can I touch on that?
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  We don't know if we're on air. We don't know.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  Experience. You don't know what they're up to.
[50:53.000 --> 50:57.000]  Like the one we have just witnessed in this Capitol.
[50:57.000 --> 51:05.000]  President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy.
[51:05.000 --> 51:18.000]  Unfortunately, we can now add January 6, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American history that will live forever in infamy.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  This temple to democracy was desecrated.
[51:22.000 --> 51:27.000]  Its windows smashed. Our offices vandalized.
[51:27.000 --> 51:36.000]  The world saw Americans elected officials hurriedly ushered out because they were in harm's way.
[51:36.000 --> 51:42.000]  The House and Senate floors were places of shelter until the evacuation was ordered,
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  leaving rioters to stalk these hallowed halls.
[51:47.000 --> 51:55.000]  Lawmakers in our staffs, average citizens who love their country, serve it every day, feared for their lives.
[51:55.000 --> 51:59.000]  I understand that one woman was shot and tragically lost her life.
[51:59.000 --> 52:05.000]  We mourn her and feel for her friends and family.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  These images were projected to the world.
[52:09.000 --> 52:18.000]  Foreign embassies cabled their home capitals to report the harrowing scenes at the very heart of our democracy.
[52:18.000 --> 52:24.000]  This will be a stain on our country, not so easily washed away.
[52:24.000 --> 52:35.000]  The final, terrible, indelible legacy of the 45th President of the United States undoubtedly are worst.
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  I want to be very clear.
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  OK, so he's a Pearl Harbor victim. Oh, they're not going to let this stain be wiped away.
[52:44.000 --> 52:50.000]  Oh, mostly peaceful protests, burning down major blocks of cities, killing cops, burning down community centers,
[52:50.000 --> 52:55.000]  burning down poor income housing, shooting people in the head at checkpoints.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  That's all wonderful. Killing pro-boys. That's all wonderful.
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  That's a stain that never existed. Oh, but this stain won't be walked away, Owen.
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.000]  Well, let's be clear. This is the huge bait and switch.
[53:06.000 --> 53:11.000]  This is the huge media lie, media narrative that we have to completely rebuke and reject.
[53:11.000 --> 53:15.000]  Trump did not cause this by stating the election was stolen.
[53:15.000 --> 53:19.000]  That's a fact. They stole the election. That's what caused this.
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  So then pointing the fingers at Trump and Trump supporters, that's all a big game.
[53:23.000 --> 53:27.000]  That's all a big con. That's all a big scythe. They stole the damn election.
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.000]  They brought us. They brought us this point. They have the son that's a communist Chinese agent.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  What do they expect to happen? We're in a civil war.
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.000]  Well, that's what I'm saying. Again, we're not encouraging violence. We tried to stop the violence.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  We're not violent revolutionaries. But, I mean, think about this logically.
[53:41.000 --> 53:45.000]  If someone comes into your home and steals all your stuff or rapes your wife or whatever,
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  you're going to track them down and you're going to beat their ass. That's instincts.
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  So, I mean, they stole the election. People are pissed about it.
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  And then you get set up with Antifa and the police, and it just ends up being this powder keg that they then blame on Trump,
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  who had nothing to do with it. He said the election was stolen. We're going to peacefully march.
[54:00.000 --> 54:05.000]  OK, now it's out of control. Go home in love. And they say, oh, Trump did it. Now he's banned on all social media.
[54:05.000 --> 54:08.000]  Yeah, so everybody knows it's a screw job. Everybody knows it's a con job.
[54:08.000 --> 54:14.000]  The thing we need to talk about is, what do we do as millions of listeners, as millions of activists,
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  with talking points and narratives to counter what's happening?
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.000]  What pressure do we put on Trump and Congress? Because Trump's totally been abandoned.
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  Now, now that sounds bad. That's actually good.
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.000]  Trump is so abandoned by all the snakes around him that now Alex Jones let him march.
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  Now we're running the show that like 15 days, he can do so much now to counter them regardless.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  We're going to talk about it in the second hour, but pray for awakening.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  But as you said, oh, when they started this, we had to push back.
[54:44.000 --> 54:51.000]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[54:58.000 --> 55:03.000]  and assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.

[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.

[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  support healthy cholesterol and more.

[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[55:38.000 --> 55:45.000]  The Post Industrial World
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  The Post Industrial World.
[55:48.000 --> 55:57.000]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[55:57.000 --> 56:04.000]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a Post Industrial World plow-swap of the Davos Group,
[56:04.000 --> 56:10.000]  the Prime Minister and Piano. They're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  It is making the population poor by designs.
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  We can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  They're destroying civilization, rebuild it in their dystopic image.
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.000]  We are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others and join the fight.
[56:41.000 --> 57:06.000]  God bless you. Visit us, spread the word, at infowars.com.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  All right. Taylor Hans is here. I'm Troyer's riding shotgun. I'm Alex Jones.
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  And I, myself, think it's important to cover antivastaging this, the rest of it,
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  but we've got to actually talk about getting Trump to talk about it, getting out articles, getting out videos,
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  where listeners compile all the evidence. We're compiling all the evidence.
[57:24.000 --> 57:30.000]  It's absolutely insane, but you were getting into the execution of Ashley Ababit and that footage,
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  how amazing it is of the guy crouching behind and then killing her and shooting her.
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.000]  Who do you think gave the order to kill four U.S. citizens in there?
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.000]  And now the media is acting like that's legitimate and Communist China is saying,
[57:40.000 --> 57:45.000]  well, we're going to kill people like Tiananmen Square now. See, we're good.
[57:45.000 --> 57:51.000]  I don't know who gave the order, but I will tell you who I saw leaving the hall and it was Chuck Schumer.
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.000]  That was the last person I saw before the shots were even fired. They rushed him out and then, like he said,
[57:55.000 --> 58:03.000]  we had this, the man that shot Ashley, he was crouching behind a wall with a glass pane where I was on the very left
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  and Ashley was climbing in on the one on the right and he was hiding there.
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.000]  She had no idea that he was even sitting there, aiming a gun right at her face.
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  And the minute that she hopped up in that pane, she had no idea that he was even there.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  He shot her right in the neck.
[58:16.000 --> 58:22.000]  Let's talk about Schumer. Go through it play by play because you're there, you go in, it's surreal,
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  you're inside the Capitol. What are you witnessing? What area are you in? What do you see Schumer doing?
[58:26.000 --> 58:32.000]  Absolutely, because the whole reason Ashley and we even ended up in that area is because we weren't being,
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  we weren't allowed to go into the actual Senate room.
[58:35.000 --> 58:41.000]  The cops were going to let us in, but then one Antifa provocateur started being violent and just caused mass outroar.
[58:41.000 --> 58:45.000]  So what I did is I followed Ashley. She was the first one to make it to those Senate doors to that hallway.
[58:45.000 --> 58:50.000]  And when me and Ashley got there, after just a few minutes, we had everybody there.
[58:50.000 --> 58:58.000]  And within those minutes, Chuck Schumer is rushed out by his security detail and within, say, about 10 seconds of him being out of sight,
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.000]  that's when Ashley was executed.
[59:02.000 --> 59:08.000]  Oh, some stations don't carry this first five minutes. I want you to tell that story again coming up and both you guys.
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.000]  Oh, and let's talk for a few minutes about strategy and then get into it and detail next segment.
[59:12.000 --> 59:18.000]  We need to talk about strategy. Has Trump conceded and how many days is it to the 20th?
[59:18.000 --> 59:19.000]  So 13?
[59:19.000 --> 59:24.000]  I think 13 or 12. But, you know, as far as Trump conceding, I don't know if he's made any official announcement
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  or he has any plans, you know, to announce a concession.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  I don't even know how he would do that since he's banned everywhere now.
[59:30.000 --> 59:36.000]  But, you know, honestly, Alex, I didn't want to say this at the time because we were all in good spirits at the Trump rally yesterday.
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  But Trump got on the stage late. When he got up there, I could tell he was desolate.
[59:39.000 --> 59:43.000]  I could tell he was depressed because I just knew it. I somehow instinctively knew it.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  Wow. He just got off the phone with Pence. That's why he's late.
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  And Pence told him he was going to certify the election for Biden and Trump just had one more person stab him in the back
[59:51.000 --> 59:58.000]  and stab him in the heart and stab him in the neck. So, you know, Trump is still in control in a way of the Trump movement.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  But what happens when Trump does leave the White House, which I think is going to be the case now?
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  I mean, I don't see how he sticks around unless by way of a miracle.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  Of course, this country existing is a miracle, so maybe miracles can happen and still do.
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  But what happens? I mean, what happens to all the Q people that said, oh, Pence, oh, Sessions, oh, all this, oh, trust the plan.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  What are they going to do? What happens to all the Trump supporters when he basically concedes the Biden leaves the White House
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  and then we're left with no leaders. We're left with a rogue leader, a leader in exile, as you called it yesterday, Alex.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  So we've got some serious thinking to do, and we've really got to get into our hearts, into our souls, and into our spirits and decide.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Exactly, because I'm just like you. Oh, and I'm telling Ellen during the break, let's, we focus on Antifa.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  We focus on the minutiae. It's all important. We got to focus on how does the public deal with learning that Trump's going to be removed?
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  How do we fight back? How do we, in the 13 days he's got left, get him to not let this stage deal at the Capitol be what he ends on,
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  but to go on the offense, to expose Antifa, to expose the chai comms, to have massive declassification and just go out in the gigantic.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  We are going to take America back. I am the president in exile, and we will never frickin surrender.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  I want to see that, but he's so surrounded. He's been so, so persecuted, and I know people that know him. He's very, he's still fighting,
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  but he just can't believe America's this week and the chai comms are taken over.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  So we're going to all talk about that. We come back as we finish up on all the other issues of Antifa and what really happened,
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  because they don't want the real history told. That's why Bandot video is there. It's why all the articles are there.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  It's why you're spreading them as king, because the enemy can't win unless they can't have us all blacked out.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  But you're not going to let them do that, Paul Revere. So Bandot video, share those links. Band.video.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  And that link is censored on Facebook and Twitter in places. So TheResistance.video. TheResistance.video.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  Hi, quality. It's been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole COVID martial law garbage.

[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  It's happening. At least we're not in our beds asleep when the vampire kills us. We are awake and fighting.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  And so the vampire came in, we stabbed it, threw a torch at it, lit on fire, but it's still coming at us burning.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  We're like, this thing's still coming at us. Well, yeah, you're in a damn fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  So I mean, the best they can do is stage a provocative action to get patriots to go into the Capitol.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  We're going to expose that. We're not going to give up. It's not like, oh, Trump's supposed to go away now.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Trump's supposed to conceive because this happened. I understand because of the 25th Amendment.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  They had Pence and a bunch of the cabinet ready to remove Trump.
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  But they're scared of his supporters really going crazy if they do that. So he's got the Trump card.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  So they didn't do that. And so he should say, we are peaceful. We've had hundreds of rallies that have been peaceful.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  It's Antifa and BLM that's violent. I want in all 50 states people to march for America and for free speech
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  and to show how you're not violent because Antifa can't stage events in all those areas.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  And we didn't do this. You did this. And he's to go on the offense.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  And when 13 days left, he needs to declassify everything. He needs to have televised events every night.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  He needs to tell that same speech he told at that rally yesterday with the evidence with Giuliani
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  and fireside chats that will override the censorship.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  And he needs to not let his presidency end on this bad note because we're going to go after Biden politically.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  We're going to expose this chai-kong roots. We're going to expose big tech.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  There's going to be a backlash, the life of what you've never seen. So don't be down, folks.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Again, the vampire sneaks in, drains our blood in China, drains the Russians blood, drains the, you know,
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  Venezuelan's blood. They never knew what hit him. Here, we were waiting for the vampire.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Patriots knew. And when he came through at 2 a.m. through the window, Nosferatu,
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  we stabbed him with a big old silver dagger. We threw gasoline on him and lit his ass on fire.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  And now he's on fire trying to take us with him out the window.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  And we're going to turn around politically with a big old giant fire hose of holy water and praying to God
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  and blasting out that damn window. So I'm telling you, these things come in waves.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  At my office, I've got big posters and photos of waves, waves around the world, big tidal waves
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  and small waves and big waves. Everything's waves, waves. Everything has an opposite and equal reaction.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Newtonian physics for every action is an opposite, equal reaction.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  So we're not giving up. Giving up means even more. That's why they try to be over the top to demoralize us.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  They're losing, even being Chuck E. Schumer is a loser. That hunchback devil worshipped and popped out of foul.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  So, Brian Stelter is a loser. All these people are scum. It's why they want to hurt us because they are trash.
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  So Owen, get into what you think, and one of our guest hosts here as well,
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  Trump does now to change the narrative back and to move away from this.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  I think he doesn't apologize. He goes to the offense.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  Well, I think one more exhibition of Trump supporters and patriots in the streets is key.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  Just one more time before Biden's inauguration show.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  Trump has all the support in America. Biden has nothing. He can't even fill a high school gymnasium.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  So just exhibit that one more time.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  But you probably do it in an airfield in the middle of nowhere, so Andy, if I can't blow something up and say you did it.
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  Yeah, but I think one more exhibit, or like you said, just call for marches around capitals, which is already happening on Saturdays anyway.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  But, you know, the good news is Trump has 12 days left, and I was talking to a couple of Trump supporters down on the streets today
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  that are, you know, all pissed off, fight mad. Like, what are we going to do? What are we going to do?
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  And I asked him, I said, let me ask you a question.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  If you were told eight years ago that the U.S. elections were rigged and they cheated every time,
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  would you have believed it? And I was like, well, you know, maybe, but not really.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  So the good news is, is Trump's still in office and people get it now.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  I mean, they fully get it. We're under an occupation.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  There are enemies domestic within. There are enemies foreign that are rigging our systems, censoring us.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  Now, here's the challenge. What is Trump going to do?
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Trump's biggest challenge, and this is sad that he didn't take our advice a while ago.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  He has no outlet now. He's banned on all social media.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  Televisions will not pick up an address.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  Trump could say, I'm doing a presidential address tomorrow. They wouldn't air it.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  They literally would not air it anywhere.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  So I don't know how he gets around that. There's other social media systems.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  He can still, he has the emergency broadcasting system. He has What's America.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  It'll get picked up. It'll get picked up.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  They use that against us here in DC. But, you know, I think the biggest thing for Trump to do,
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  if he is going to leave the office, he can destroy these people before they ever get in.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  He can declassify every...
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  China Joe's going to ban your oil. China Joe's going to sell you out on drugs.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  Well, not even that. I think just showing all the... Remember, we have tens of millions of dollars of payouts.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  Our taxpayers of congressmen and potentially women settling sexual assault cases.
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  Declassify that. Declassify all of it. Declassify all of the names that run Epstein's list.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  Insider trading by Congress.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  And then I think the greatest thing Trump can do, and he needs the military behind him to do this,
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  but I really think this would be the ultimate ace up the sleeve.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  I would extradite Joe Biden to Ukraine. Let's see them put Joe Biden in the White House
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  when he's over in Ukraine going to jail.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  Yeah, but I mean, he needs the Justice Department to do that.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  Yeah, so I mean, that's what Trump has a bunch of different cards he can play.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  What is he going to do between now and the next 12 days?
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  I mean, no telling really. He hasn't really shown his poker face.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  He doesn't, you know, so... Well, he needs to expose that Antifa staged this.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  We now know there were Antifa there. We can show who they are.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  They've got names. We need to do that.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  What do you think, Mr. Hansen?
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  I think he needs to march right down to the CIA file cabinet, open it, and livestream everything.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  He needs to declassify UFOs, JFK, absolutely everything,
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  considering how bad our government screwed him.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  He could turn around and screw him just as bad, if not worse.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  All I know is, I like Rand Paul, but he says we must absolutely fix this mess.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  You don't act like this in America.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  Well, that's great, Rand Paul. You spoke out against when they broke your ribs,
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  when they tried to kill you and Congressman Scalise.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  So when you criticize conservatives being manipulated into this by Antifa,
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  spend a little more time about the left and what they've done.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  But let's actually also be historically accurate about this.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  That is what America is about. We fight tyrants. That's what we do.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  We don't take tyrants. We don't tolerate them.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  But we choose the time and place.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  Of course.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  They had a good chance on getting that 10-day investigation.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  They didn't want that. That's why they say it's violence.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  And so when they're coming to confiscate our guns, or they're coming with things like that,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  that's when less than a concord happened.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  We don't want to go there if we have to.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Just like they said, we don't want a war, but if it starts today, if they fire first, it does.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  And so, yes, they fired first.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  You gave that analogy and that parallel to the killing of this poor woman
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  to what happened back in 1776.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Exactly.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  So in 1776, a 11-year-old child was shot and killed by a British loyalist.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  And this triggered one of our founding fathers to actually amplify this
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  and say, this will never happen again.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  And he did this for months and months and months over again.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  And that is what eventually led to the Boston Massacre and got us our freedom.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  That's exactly what Ashley Babbitt is for us.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  That is exactly what she needs to be.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  She is a hero and she should be praised like that.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  And that's why they don't want her name Ashley Babbitt out there or the other three.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  Again, as you said, oh, and where are these three people that were killed?
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  What are their names? What happened?
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  And again, you know, it's just, it's the same double standard that we see every time here.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  When the left writes, they say, oh, this is what America's about.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  When the right protests, it's, oh, this is not what America's about.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  So again, it's that double standard.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  But again, Trump, here's the thing.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  In my opinion, and I think it's been this way for a while, there is no will at all in DC to stop the steal of this election.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  There's none. There's people in the media.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  There's Trump and then some people perhaps on in his team that want to stop the steal.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  But like some of these people that are organizing some of these speeches and talking, they have no really no will.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  They're just kind of in it for the fame and it for the fortune.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  And they'll probably go away when Trump concedes.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  You won't hear much from them.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  And then they'll come back up within the ranks of the Republican establishment.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  But Trump needs to now execute his will.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  He needs to decide what his will is.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  Is his will to really stop the steal?
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  Is his will to keep Biden out of the White House?
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Is his will to just expose all the corruption within the government?
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  Is his will to advance, investigate the people that have been the most vitriolic towards President Trump and our Republic, the Schumers, the Pelosi's?
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  How did Nancy Pelosi make hundreds of millions of dollars?
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  How did Maxine Waters make hundreds of millions of dollars?
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  Where does the money go?
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Where does the money go?
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Another trillion dollars out in stimulus.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Now we're figuring out where it goes.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  Oh, all these foreign countries.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  All these foreign countries.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  They've been stealing our money for decades.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  So, and this is something that should actually unite the people.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  This is something that would actually unite the people is, I think, going into the CIA, exposing all the corruption, going into, again, it's all about will, though.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Is there any will to investigate Nancy Pelosi and find out where her money comes?
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  They investigate Trump all day long.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  They investigate him in New York.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  They investigate him in DC.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  They give him a proctology as he is every morning.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Well, when I come back, I'm going to explain all this is a dead end, and I'm not trying to put you down, but it's a dead end.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  The Justice Department will not federally do anything.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  So that's like saying, let's go to the moon without a rocket.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Trump's will. It's whatever Trump wants to do.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  The way the bureaucracy works, he's like, if I ask you to go downstairs and get me a Coca-Cola, if you refuse to do it, I have to go do it, right?
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Well, that's getting the Coca-Cola. How about this whole giant bureaucracy?
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  And I'm not putting you down, but this is what we've gone through over and over again.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Okay. And when we come back, I'm going to explain all this. Okay.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  We look at Q to do it. We look at Trump to do it.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  And we throw out so many things need to be done.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  We need, and I'm not criticizing you.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  I want to get the answer because I've got a few ideas, but in this dwindling daylight we have before Biden takes over, it can still be stopped.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  But we've got to talk about the chinks in the armor and the specific things that we need to get Trump to do.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  There's got to be a limited list. Roger Stone taught me that. Go to the president with limited thanks.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture? Me too.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  You probably already believe that. I certainly do.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  So here's the thing. I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.

[1:14:53.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  Inflation is here and many experts believe hyperinflation could be coming, especially if the globalists are successful in killing the dollar.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Tens of millions of Americans that were not awake are now beginning to store food. That's a good thing, but it's going to drive up prices and we're already beginning to see record sales once again.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  We the people understand it's up to us to protect ourselves. It's up to us to become self-sufficient. The globalists are waging siege against us, trying to destroy our businesses,
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  trying to bankrupt our families, our towns, our churches. That's why, while we still can, we've got to get prepared and get ready.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  Take advantage of a huge, final mega sale before prices go up at PrepareWithAlex.com and save up to $850 off the highest quality storeable foods out there.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  You've got until Friday, January 8th to get your orders in at PrepareWithAlex.com and lock in the lowest prices out there on high quality storeable food.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado. Thank you for holding. How are you doing, Alex? Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother, how are you?
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug, that DNA force. I love it. I've been using it quite a while and I just went, looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that it contains quercetin,
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  So people might want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription,
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  but the doctor itself like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks. And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  So thanks, thanks for the plug.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  Look, I knew the globalists were coming. I knew with their whole operation and really it's exposing them and their agenda as being evil is the way to stop them.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  And to get the general public to realize complying with the New World Order, the UN, the mask, the lockdowns isn't helping society. It's the broken social contract.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  And so I tell everybody, you need to call the White House, you need to tweet at Trump, you need to come March. I've already done it and March around the White House and say, go on air, go on air.
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  The system hated that speech. But so what if Twitter blocks Trump? It'll get out everywhere. It'll get out on InfoWords and Newsmax and Fox News and go out and like Owen was saying, like he was saying, hammer them on each issue.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  But I would start with Trump has a press conference about this. The media will think he's weak. They'll come to the Rose Garden. He has the press conference tomorrow morning, Friday morning.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  And he says, oh, what about him burning down cities? What about Antifa doing this? What about him killing people? We're told Antifa was there.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  They say, oh, what's your evidence? Go look at it. They bragged. He needs to go on the offense on every point and go after Biden as a communist Chinese agent and his son as an agent with all the evidence.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  And that's what you hammer is. The globalists are going to cut off your oil. They're going to cut off your gas. They didn't give you $2,000. They gave you $600. They're the enemy. They're taking you over.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  They're like, oh, you're going to foster violence. He's never pushed violence. He says, I don't support violence. You're people's stage.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  You guys got any comments? What Trump should do? Well, exactly. Like what you said is he needs to go up. He needs to be doing emergency broadcasts.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  He needs to be hijacking people's televisions every single night and exposing what these globalists are doing. He needs to be declassifying these things.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  He needs to be showing the American people how Nancy Pelosi is making hundreds of millions of dollars, how these people are covering up sex crimes and everything they're doing.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  Well, let's remember Epstein coming out all this. They're the ones on the defense. That's why they had to do the COVID lockdown. That's why they've got to do the censorship. That's making them incredibly unpopular.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  So people think we're losing. We're not. Yeah, they've stolen it from our president because they have to. They have no choice. So I go back to this. What does Trump do?
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  He keeps worrying about overturning the election. It's all political. Yeah, they stole it. He has to expose that they're bad, not even that they stole it, that they're Chinese Asians, that they're globalists.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  They promote that affiliate, that they hate America.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  Well, if he's going to leave the White House, he should do a press conference and basically just say like, oh, here's everything they're going to do. Your taxes are going to go up.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  You're going to get forced vaccines to be a consumer and to just lay it all out. And then that puts them against the fence to if they do it, well, they've been caught and everybody knows Trump.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  Trump was right. So I mean, that's like the most softball thing he could do.
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  I agree. Remember, he used to speak every night. Remember, tomorrow I'll tell you how they're going to take your oil and why when they increase coal prices, why you go bankrupt?
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  He should just attack energy, borders, military, China and just each night say, this is what they're going to do for a couple hours. And then people are going to go, holy crap.
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Well, and that kind of gives that that hymns the Democrats in where it's like, OK, if they do it, now everybody's seeing what's actually going on where oh, they just do it and say, oh, it's virtuous or they do it at midnight on Christmas Eve or whatever the stuff.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  And he should read him his inaugural speech say four years ago, I gave you this inauguration. Look how much I delivered. Here it is. I'm going to read it again.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  Just attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  Yeah. And then, you know, he can also just kind of do one last thing to where he celebrates all the victories that he had, all the great things that he accomplishes present and just say, look, this is never going to happen again.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  None of this is going to happen again. And it's going to be worse than ever. But, you know, it's so twisted because we don't even know who's going to be present.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  I mean, sure, Biden will be the figurehead for maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe a year. But who's telling Biden what to say? This guy can't even think.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  He doesn't even know where he is half the time. So they got Kamala Harris ready. He needs to point that out, too.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  He needs to say, look, Kamala Harris is the real president. Biden doesn't even know where he is. And she's probably taking orders from Barack Obama, who's acting as a go-between, even admitted in a TV interview.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  He's like, well, I would never want to be back in politics. But if I could just run the scenes from behind, you know, just being someone's ear, I'd do that.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  So that's Biden. That's Harris. But again, Trump can get on the front of it and say, look, they're going to put Kamala Harris in.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  She had the lowest, she had the lowest percentage of support during the Democrat primaries, and she dropped out before a vote was even cast.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  So he can make that prediction. Oh, now what are they going to do? They're going to make Trump proven right by putting Harris in, installing her instead of Biden?
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  Look, look, look, he needs to level the American people. The global government can't have a free country. It can't have capitalism. It can't have a middle class.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  This is globally depressing. The great reset to make you poor. Trump needs to give a great reset speech like Winston Churchill would and say they're coming.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  They've got the media. They've got the courts. They've got both parties. I fought hard. You did a great job. It's up to you now.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  This is the great reset. They're going to impoverish you. They're going to destroy you. Here's what Klaus Schwab says. Here's what David Rockefeller said.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  Here's what Ted Turner said. Here's what Bill Gates said. He gives the great reset. Unless you expose the New World Order, nothing else makes sense.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  Nothing else is just, it's dealing with the symptoms of the disease. That's what I'm saying. He must give the great reset speech, but it's okay.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  Because we're going to give the great reset speech. It's okay because we're going to expose the New World Order.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  It's okay because you funded info wars that we've barely been promoting or plugging. We're going to continue on to the future and we're not going to give up.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  And you aren't either because we don't have a choice. I think that's what it comes down to.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Well, and that's why you can debate all day long. What is a reasonable response to what we're dealing with? I mean, what is the reasonable response?
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  How do you measure that? How do you decide? You know, you look at history. You look at around the world.
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  What do we do when we've lost every measurement, every lever of influence over our country, when we've lost it all, and it's all been stolen from us?
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  What are we supposed to do? I mean, that's, I think, whatever.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  No, that's it. I mean, I think what you said earlier is true. It's what I said yesterday. They've raped us. This is a takeover.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  Whatever we do, being attacked and taken over and demoralized and anti-fun, BLM burning things. We're told it's good.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  And then if we stand up and fight, we're bad. I mean, these are sick people that have no bottom.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  And so we just need to know we love America. We love all of our people, old, young, black, white, you name it, Hispanic, Asian.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  We all have a love of God, and we're just not going to stop.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  Now, I want to do this next segment.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  As you started getting into this, Mr. Hansen earlier, with the lady that was killed, the lady that was executed, Ashley Babbitt.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  And I want Taylor Hansen, when we come back to lay out again, because some stages don't care that first little five minutes, you were there when she was killed.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  What it was like to watch her, you had her blood on you, I guess. And you're there on video, and you see this execution happen, and the media won't even say her name.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  So one thing I did get from Black Lives Matter that's true is say her name, because they never want to say folks' name.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  And then of course, Senator Paul did say her name, did a bill to stop doing no non-warrants, so he got physically attacked.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  But we're going to talk about saying her name, Mrs. Babbitt, and her husband, and we really want to get on.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  And all of this on the other side of what you witnessed.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  And then I want to open the phones up and take calls specifically on what you think with 13 days Trump should do.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Has he conceded? You can read his tweet. He said, I think we have the elections stolen. I'm not agreeing to this fraud, but I will agree to the peaceful transfer and some power, because they told him.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  We got Mike Pence. We got the rest of your candidates. They're all cowards. They'll 25th Amendment, you're asked right now.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  They only did that because removing him would cause a bigger backlash.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  Maybe Trump should force them to do a 25th Amendment, not because he's going to not peacefully transfer power, but because it's a fraud.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  So they're scared of the power he still got. We'll cover it on the other side. I'm Alex Jones. This is History Happening.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  We're only here because of you. Thank you all for your support. Spread the word about the live feed. It's a revolutionary act.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden. And now that all the lies are being revealed, what will you do?
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing. They will do whatever they are told, as if obedience is a virtue. It is the Patriots of the world versus everybody else.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. That I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  And that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as I can. So help me God.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  It's amazing. Folks absolutely love it. And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it. Now a limited supply is back in stock. 25% off at mfullworthstore.com.

[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  Alright, Taylor Hanson was there. I'm Alex Jones, the old Troyer.
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  You were there when this poor lady, Ashley Babbitt, got executed, along with three other Americans, they won't even tell us their names.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  They're calling us the terrorists, but they were killing us. You were there, described, you talked to her before she died, what happened, what you witnessed, and the fact you saw Chucky Schumer.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  It was his security detail that he was, I guess, one of the blood sacrifices. We know, remember he threatened Trump, he said, if you ban abortion, we will annihilate you, you will pay. It was like, these are our babies, baby feast.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  He seemed to get really upset.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  Oh yeah, he wasn't very happy. I mean, touching on Ashley, it all really started when I ran into her, when everyone was pushing into the Senate floor, and the cops were actually going to let them in, and then one Antifa provocateur started attacking, and just ruined it for absolutely everybody that was there being peaceful.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  And so that's when I saw Ashley actually kick back from the crowd and take the left. And so I followed her because I was interested, and I had talked to her right as we were at those doors prior to that. And the only reason she was there, too, was to withhold our republic, to save our constitution, save our country.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  She was there for a reason. She had every right to be there.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  And what I saw is absolutely disgusting, you know, it mortifies me. I saw a security officer, not even probably 15, 20 seconds after I saw Schumer, right through those glass panes get rushed out of the Senate hall, right around that corner.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  The minute he gets around that corner, that's when Ashley goes up in that window, and the officer hiding behind the wall, she can't even see him, executes her, shoots her right in the neck for no reason.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  Cold-blooded murder could have stopped her, could have shot her with tear gas, could have called more police.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  There was cops standing right next to her, three on the wall as she climbed through that window. Any one of them could have done that.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  Well, that was my last question. Describe how it got breached, why people went in. At first, it's kind of like Wisconsin or Michigan, the footage I've seen where they went in with guns.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  Cops didn't attack them, so it ended peacefully. This went different, so the cops let everybody in, but then selectively, the security kills people.
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  Yeah, exactly. And with that Antifa provocateur, that was actually that ruined it for everybody to get in and actually listen to the Senate hearing, be a part of it, be part of history.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  He actually came over and he was the one that started it and eventually led to Ashley's death. The three cops that were lined up at the Senate doors, he was reaching around both of them on the side, just smashing the windows.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  The cops weren't doing anything, they handled it honestly very calmly. And then within a few seconds, the cops have shifted over to the wall and they had the special tactician's unit in the stairwell where nobody could see them at all.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  And that's when Ashley went over and that's when they executed her.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  I'm curious, because you're talking about the last person you saw with Schumer. So was there anyone else behind that door? Were there any other congressmen or women that were behind that door when they were barricaded in, just with the security, or were they all already evacuated?
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  I saw a few of them walking out in front of Schumer, but I couldn't recognize who they were. But Schumer, I mean, that's an ugly mug. You can't really mix that one up.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  That's like a hunchback goblin. He has an energy of just sadistic people. You can feel it. I saw that man, I felt that. That's Anthony Weiner's daddy.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  Go ahead and look at Schumer's husband, or I mean wife, and you'll get an idea of what he's into.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  Everyone has their preferences, but that isn't mine. I'll tell you that right there.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:33:03.000]  Here's why I ask that, because if they had already evacuated all of the congressmen and women, then what were they still doing there? Why were they firing? I mean, that's a question that needs to be addressed as well.
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  Because if they're just sitting there and they're just pointing guns at a window waiting for someone to come through that, like we said.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:20.000]  I also love the left. When a guy pulls a gun on the cops and they're black and they get killed, it's like, oh, it's terrible. But they're like, I love it. See her die. It's so great. Kill them all.
[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  You should see my mentions in my DMs right now. They're disgusting. I've never seen something so mortifying. It is absolutely just terrifying what these people and how these people actually think it's mental illness on a total next level.
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  All right, so here we are at a historic moment. I keep going back to this.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  Trump has basically conceded. He says he will go along with an orderly transitional power. We're 13 days out from Joe Biden right over there.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  I predicted, I said, people go, hey, they're building a stage. Trump thinks he's going to win. And I went, well, they're building it.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  Because that's just what the federal government does in case Biden wants it. Well, Biden now admitted last week he's canceling doing a parade and speaking.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  He'd already said it was virtual because that's because he wanted to do a faint where, oh, I'm not going to be out there. Don't come protest me.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  So then he's like, oh, actually, I am going to be there. But now I'm not going to be there. And so that's really what they're planning. I think is that Biden is going to show up on that stage, but only have their little minions there.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  Because they're all about deception. And so I think that's what's really happening. But to symbolically have the Trump folks take that over, I would have been fine with them taking the stage over symbolically.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  I was just mad that Antifa tricked them from, you know, actually going in there.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  And I wonder, though, because that's a big risk for them to take putting Biden up there. Because again, no one's going to show up.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  I mean, they tried to run the fake news in 2017 that Trump didn't have anybody at his inauguration. It was the biggest inauguration crowd in US history.
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  They just lied about the images and when they were taken and blocked people out. I mean, what are they going to do if Biden has an inauguration?
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  And I mean, no one's going to show up. Trump supporters, even if they announced it 24 hours before, Trump supporters will still outnumber Biden at his inauguration.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  Just like every fake rally Biden had leading up to the election. So I don't need, I mean, that's a big risk for them to take with the optics of stealing an election and then having no turnout for a Biden inauguration when just two weeks before a million people were in DC for Trump.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  So I don't know how they pull that off. Look, Biden looks like he's halfway dead. I mean, I'm not saying that as a joke. I mean, seriously, you look at his speeches that he's doing now.
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  I don't know if they intentionally quit putting makeup on. It looks like they got a guy at a nursing home that's 90 up and may put him in a suit.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  Like, hey, let's get great grandpa up and make him go give a Toastmaster speech. They're setting the stage for Kamala. He doesn't know what damn planet he's on.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  And they used to before the, remember, you know, we forget about this, but this is still a key element in this election. Well, the globalist hated seeing a strong leader like Trump.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  So they go, hey, let's give them a creep keeper. Yeah. And I mean, we're talking like a freeze dried skeleton, like a bird skeleton.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  This is this is a big element of the theft of our election that nobody's really talking about. And I think we should put it back into the four. They canceled presidential debates.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  We only got one presidential debate. How can we even do that? And of course, but see, but what I'm saying is they used to get Biden all jacked up on drugs and they put all the makeup on.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  That's why he knew that he could hide the basement because it was all fixed. But now they don't they don't do them. They don't put the makeup on them.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  They don't give them the drugs. So I mean, he's having these speeches and I mean, he doesn't even know what's going on. He has no energy about and the thing in my body.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  And he looks like it. Like you said, I mean, it's sad, you know, but everybody knows the scene in the nursing homes.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  It's all meant to be like, I was once I got to go to work at the auto plant and my grandpa, that was 30 years ago. I was used to work at the plant.
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Well, it's good. They're good. They give me money. You know, we got a big election fraud group together. We're going to steal it. I don't need all you to vote for me.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  I'm going to win. I mean, he's like, you know the thing, right? You just know the thing. You know the thing.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  Don't forget about it. Oh, and here's my sister or I mean, my wife or I mean, oh, what city am I in? Oh, you know.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  And I remember being over here at the Kennedy Center. We're at the Kennedy Center, but you're in Ohio.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  You are right, but I think it's even beyond just replacing the strongman leader from Trump with the weakest leader ever in Biden.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  Then they also get like waves. They also then get to bring in Kamala, who is a strong figure. I mean, that is a domineering woman.
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  And I'm being polite about this female dog, but she is a domineering woman.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  And so you take, again, another weak decrepit leader of Biden, replace it with a strong woman, Harris.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  And of course, they'll build her up. She'll get magazine cover stories for months and months and months about how great she is.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  They like her because she's so unpopular. Any minute they want, they can just turn her off. Just like boom.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  And plus, I mean, you know, they could not only turn her off, they could turn on her.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  Maybe a tomorrow could come out and say, look at all the people Kamala Harris put in jail. She's a dirty cop.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  They don't do it because right now they've ingratiated her. But I mean, people don't like Kamala Harris.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  I agree. I was going to ask this question again. What do we do? What pressure do we put on Trump? What does he do?
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  Because here's the good spot we're at. We're in a bad spot. We're in a spot where folks know the cute things, not real.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  We're in a spot where people understand that Trump's totally surrounded to the point of, you know, in force.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  We're in the portal bodies here where we've reached this point where people now realize it's them selves that have to do something.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  So what do we do? I say we call the White House. We hit Trump's Twitter. We call Don Jr. I call everybody.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  I know we get General Flynn back on air and we talk about things post Trump where we go if he isn't going to take action.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  And I think Trump will take action. He's just got to see our support.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since Monday.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  When I heard you got that first shipment of living defense in from Utah, I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones' show, I'm going to tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old, going on 20, thanks to this info for store products.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  And by the way, I bought $800 worth the other night.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  So I'm doing what I can, brother.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  So what my intention is, why don't we start this new year off right with everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense?
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Now, you got to follow that up with the MicroZX. I learned that.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  We didn't know. We didn't screen your call. We had no idea. And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about living defense, living defense, living defense.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  It's officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  And it only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle against evil and stopping abortion.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  We must start valuing human life again.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  Due to the COVID lockdown destroying the supply chain, many of the best-selling products implores are no longer available.
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  And I thought that Paula Block might be gone forever, but after eight months, we got about 25% of the order we put in delivered to us.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  The rest, they hope, in a few months comes in.

[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  It's very powerful when it comes to blocking seasonal irritants and a lot more.

[1:41:48.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  The Resistance.video The Resistance.video.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  InfoWars.com News Wars.com
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:24.360]  a new URL before they ban it, but Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:33.800]  But the new website is TheResistance.video. They're trying to block us because the truth is
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:40.280]  powerful and can defeat them. So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos
[1:42:40.280 --> 1:42:44.520]  and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information
[1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:50.520]  is that TheResistance.video. Share the link. TheResistance.video. TheResistance.video.
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:43:07.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:20.520 --> 1:43:45.960]  All right. Taylor Hansen and Owen Stroyer are riding shotgun with us. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:50.840]  And I want to open the phones up specifically on what you think about what happened at the Capitol
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:56.200]  yesterday and what you think President Trump should do with 13 days left. All right. So the
[1:43:56.200 --> 1:44:07.320]  number is 877-789-Alex877-789-2539-877-789 Alex. And we will take some of your calls. But listen,
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:11.480]  I love you. You love me. We're great. Just I'm not going to do the hey, thanks for the call. I'm
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:15.560]  just going to say your name. Go to get a quick comment move the next person because so much
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:20.360]  is going down. So much is happening. Now, I like Mr. Hansen what you were just saying about Q.
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:25.880]  It helped red pill you. Hey, there's a new old order. Hey, there are pedophiles. Most of what
[1:44:25.880 --> 1:44:32.040]  it talks about is real. But then there's this esoteric nature. Everything's handled. Everything's
[1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:36.520]  great. There's a secret group. Everything's going according to plan. You don't have to worry about
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:41.320]  stuff. I know prominent people didn't come to DC because they thought, oh, everything's handled.
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:45.720]  Trump's invincible. And I mean, I'm talking to Trump. I'm talking to his crew. Thank you. We need help.
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:50.040]  Everyone's abandoned us. And I'm just like, I'm not like, hey, I'm helping Trump. I'm like,
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:53.880]  I'm like, we're the last guy standing doing this because the crew keeps us on air. The
[1:44:53.880 --> 1:45:00.360]  listeners keep us on air. So your take on what this does to Q even when Trump leaves in 13 days.
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:06.440]  I mean, his Q, I believe Q, like what you were saying, Alex, is it was a great thing when it
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:10.200]  first started. You know, it was it was a way to introduce people to all the evils of what these
[1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:14.440]  globalists are doing and all this pedophilia, all this satanic worship, all these sacrifices.
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:19.400]  And that's how I personally got redpilled. But it led to me doing more independent research. And I
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:23.880]  think that's what's great about Q is they do their own research. They don't just trust fake news.
[1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:28.840]  And I think that was a great topic about it. But the real downfall of it was trust the plan.
[1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:33.640]  As you said, you know, you got people staying home when Trump himself are telling them to come.
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:37.400]  But they're trusting the plan, but they're not listening directly to the plan. Supposedly.
[1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:42.760]  It just that was the downfall of the entire Q movement. And honestly, of I believe Trump,
[1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:46.280]  I mean, you have all these people to sign the majority. That's not what wins you elections.
[1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:49.560]  You need outspoken majority. You need outspoken support.
[1:45:50.200 --> 1:45:53.400]  Yeah. And you know, the whole notion of trusting the plan, the bigger the plan is,
[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:58.600]  the harder it is to actually execute the plan. And we're talking at the top level of any plan
[1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:03.080]  that they're alleging, we had a plan yesterday, we were going to march from the Trump rally to
[1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:08.520]  the Capitol, and then we had a stage set up. That's it. You got to change plans all the time.
[1:46:08.520 --> 1:46:13.080]  And they get sabotaged. And I'm kicking myself because they were gonna false flag.
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:17.320]  They said they were. I was so busy focusing on Trump and a million people that we let him
[1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:22.200]  screw us. And I don't admit that Antifa kicked our ass and set us up with a gigantic victory.
[1:46:22.200 --> 1:46:26.360]  Because I'm proud for him. I don't want it to happen next time. Well, and the problem was
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:30.600]  pissed off. The problem was it was a million of us there. Yes, it was a million of us there.
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:35.640]  Okay, watching Trump speak. And then we're not even thinking because we're at the event. And
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:39.880]  we're thinking, okay, everybody's here. Everybody's getting the gravity to come see Trump. We're
[1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:43.720]  not even thinking, oh, there's groups over here at the Supreme Court. Oh, there's groups over here
[1:46:44.200 --> 1:46:48.680]  at the Capitol to think like, okay, we need to make sure we're all coordinated on the same page.
[1:46:48.680 --> 1:46:51.560]  Because while you guys were at the Capitol, I'll talk to other people at the Capitol,
[1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:55.880]  you know, you guys really didn't even know what was going on at the Trump rally. You weren't
[1:46:55.880 --> 1:46:59.080]  following that. You were doing your own boots on the ground, either coverage or, or, you know,
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:03.960]  rallying whatever they're at the Capitol. So it was like two huge, massive groups, no intercom
[1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:08.520]  between them. And so by the time the people from the Trump rally were ready to activate and then
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:12.680]  go over to the Capitol, there was already all the stuff popping off at the Capitol that it was too
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:16.600]  late to even try to stop. I mean, like we tried to go stop, but it was too late. I mean, too many
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:22.040]  people already inside. And at that point, it was police versus people inside. And at that point,
[1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:25.800]  probably the Antifa people pulled out so they wouldn't get arrested or whatever and identified.
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:30.360]  And, and, you know, that was the promise. We didn't have that line of communication, but
[1:47:30.360 --> 1:47:33.880]  there's so many, there's so damn many of us. Exactly. So damn many of us. Well,
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:37.720]  we needed that line of communication is the thing that was detrimental to exactly what happened
[1:47:37.720 --> 1:47:40.840]  down there. You know, I was down there on the ground. I was one of the first ones there at the
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:46.040]  Capitol. And what I saw there, you know, the police were letting them in at first. But then
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:50.200]  right as we got up to that police line up top, that's when it got really violent. That's when I
[1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:54.120]  see the Antifa members I know from Portland, the Antifa members that personally have gotten
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:59.000]  meat jumped and attacked in Portland, they're staging photo shoots to make it look like Trump
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:03.240]  supporters are attacking officers. And I was trying to do everything I can to expose it. I'm
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:08.120]  sitting there yelling, this guy is Antifa. This guy is Antifa. You know, this is a provocateur.
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:11.720]  Nobody listens. You know, they're dressed in Trump supporter gear. Nobody believes it.
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:16.200]  Once they attacked the police and they got that strong reaction from the police, one I've never
[1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:21.080]  seen before, even on night 100 in Portland, it was gone. You know, these Trump supporters,
[1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:25.880]  they felt betrayed. They felt like the people that they back, when they back the blue with all
[1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:30.200]  their support, all their love, everything, they betrayed them. That's how they saw it. And that's
[1:48:30.200 --> 1:48:35.480]  exactly what Antifa went there to do. Yeah. And I think another, to go back to, you know, the Q
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:39.160]  thing or Trump supporters, what are, what, what's going to be going through their head? A lot of
[1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:43.720]  Trump supporters didn't really know how bad it was. Now they do. A lot of the Q supporters,
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:48.200]  like you said, think, oh, you know, it trusts the plan Patriots are control. Well, okay, obviously
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:52.040]  not Patriots are stabbing us in the back left and right. The same people that Q was saying,
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:55.240]  Oh, these are the heroes. They're going to pull us through this. So I wonder what's going through
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:48:59.320]  their head. You know, for you, you kind of figured this out a while ago for, for info wars in our
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:03.720]  audience, we knew that this was how dire it was. But these people are just figuring this out. Again,
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:06.920]  I asked some Trump supporters out on the streets this morning, just, you know, because they're
[1:49:06.920 --> 1:49:09.720]  fired up and they're like, looking at info wars, like, what's the answer? What do we do? And it's
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:13.240]  like, Hey, man, I'm in this just like you, I'm, you know, I'm confuddled trying to figure out
[1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:17.160]  what to do about this too. I don't want to see the Republic destroyed. I don't want to see a civil
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:21.320]  war. I don't want to see us goose stepped into a worldwide government through a controlled civil
[1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:25.320]  war just to pit us against this one another. But they're now getting it's like, wow, it is that
[1:49:25.320 --> 1:49:29.960]  bad. It's like, wow, oh my gosh, Trump is, is, is going to probably have to leave office because
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:33.880]  they just cheated and rigged our election. So what, what are they going through? Do you think
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:38.680]  right now, emotionally, intellectually, intellectually realizing how bad it is? Because
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:41.960]  anybody who takes the red pill knows there's like a year or two where it's like, you know,
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:46.040]  depression, desolation until you really get into battle mode. There's, there's the,
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:50.120]  you know, the surprise stage. This, this can't be real. There's no way. And then there's,
[1:49:50.120 --> 1:49:53.240]  you know, the second stage and then it turns into anger. And that's where it stays. That's
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:56.520]  the final stage of it. And that's why you get patriots out here that are so angry,
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:50:00.520]  that are so fed up with this government, that are so fed up with all these pedophile globalists
[1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:04.440]  in the movement. And I know a lot of people that still believe in Q. I mean, I have a lot of friends,
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:08.920]  you know, I have, I have family that believe in Q. And now you're seeing a freak out, you know,
[1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:11.960]  I was on Twitter scrolling through last night, because I was wondering the same thing, you know,
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:16.520]  after, I mean, because Trump basically conceded last night, he told the entire nation that he's
[1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:19.880]  going to turn it over to Joe Biden, and he's going to be the president in the United States,
[1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:23.080]  which is not the plan. So these people are freaking out already. I mean,
[1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:26.760]  he asked some of them probably are kind of being a little bit biased and wanting to trust the plan
[1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:31.560]  still. But that's not going to work. All it was was a plan to keep us complacent, a plan to not
[1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:36.760]  keep us on the streets doing activism that can actually make a change and a positive impact
[1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:42.600]  to help Donald Trump. Now, what I wondered also, what's going to happen to the Republican Party
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:46.200]  after all of these people stabbed Trump in the back? I mean, there's only going to be a few of
[1:50:46.200 --> 1:50:51.240]  them that have any support left. And so now the Democrats have all the political advantage,
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:55.400]  because the Republican Party just stabbed all of their voters in the back. I mean, Mitch McConnell,
[1:50:55.400 --> 1:51:04.760]  this dirtbag, he was calling all the Republican senators two nights ago on Monday, Monday night,
[1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:08.440]  I believe it was, Mitch McConnell was calling all them. This was after Trump called them.
[1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:13.240]  So Trump called them, showed them all the evidence of the voter fraud, and then Mitch
[1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:18.840]  McConnell called them back after Trump finished his phone call and said, certified Joe Biden,
[1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:24.520]  we have to certify Joe Biden. If we don't, we'll never win another election. It's the exact opposite.
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:31.800]  The Republican Party just committed suicide by not getting Trump another four years and denying
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:35.720]  the certification of Joe Biden. They just committed suicide. There's not going to be many Republicans
[1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:42.040]  that have much support left. And then when Biden amnesties 30 million illegal immigrants, boom,
[1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:46.440]  they don't even have to cheat in elections anymore, because they have all the numbers with the people
[1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:49.800]  that abandon the Republican Party. And now the illegal immigrants that they're going to have
[1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:56.920]  voting Democrats. Exactly. I'm already hearing that. Well, exactly. That was the one big sigh
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:52:02.280]  up as well is don't vote, don't vote, don't vote. It's like you look at it. If we don't vote Republican,
[1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:06.200]  you don't vote Trump. Trump is not in office. You've got to overwhelm the fraud with even bigger
[1:52:06.200 --> 1:52:11.800]  landslides. Exactly. Well, and when you look at it this way, there will never be a Republican
[1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:15.320]  elected again at this point. If we let them get control and we let them have all the power,
[1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:18.360]  they're going to have. That's why we're also pisses. We're all going to take it off. Well,
[1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:23.800]  anyway, the RNC, Trump supporters aren't about the RNC. We're about Trump. We love the populism
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:27.080]  movement. That's what we love. And that's what we're about. We love America. The RNC doesn't
[1:52:27.080 --> 1:52:32.200]  love America. We don't support the RNC. We primary these people, these traders, because that's what
[1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:38.200]  they are. So this is, you know, I don't even know the analogy to make, but we're all kind of in this
[1:52:38.200 --> 1:52:42.440]  position where we know we have this. It's like, it's like, okay, you know what it is? It's like
[1:52:42.440 --> 1:52:47.400]  being underwater and you've lost your tether to the boat and you got 30 minutes left on the oxygen
[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:51.880]  tank. And so we're trying to figure out what do we do? Okay, there's a shipwreckage over there
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:56.120]  that maybe has some oxygen left. And I can go down into it and get that oxygen and maybe survive
[1:52:56.120 --> 1:53:01.640]  another three weeks and get rescued. Or do I risk it and try to swim back up to the top in the abyss
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:05.800]  where I may run out of oxygen? So I mean, it's like, we're trying to figure out where we're on a
[1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:13.800]  dying bed here. How are we going to survive? I'll say this, fortune favors the bull. And so people
[1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:18.360]  that tell you violence never saw within your liars, they fear violence. That's what the globalist
[1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:24.680]  help trigger and stage wimpy, stupid mob violence that that that that then discredited any real
[1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:28.680]  violence. And I'm not saying I want violence. I'm saying the globalists are coming with vaccines
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:32.520]  that are violent. They're coming with anti for shooting you and killing you this violent. They're
[1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:35.800]  coming with world government is violent. So we have to just start having a real debate with the
[1:53:35.800 --> 1:53:39.400]  globalist that you're assaulting us. We're going to have a larger discussion about how you're going
[1:53:39.400 --> 1:53:45.720]  to pay for it. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:50.840]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this
[1:53:50.840 --> 1:53:57.240]  degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com.
[1:53:57.240 --> 1:54:02.920]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:08.920]  pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing
[1:54:08.920 --> 1:54:15.240]  reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have
[1:54:15.240 --> 1:54:22.040]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:29.000]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:35.720]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:43.480]  friend, family member or yourself at info wars store.com. It's not a secret why and left us
[1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:48.280]  controlled cities all over the world, not just the U.S. They encourage people to live in tents,
[1:54:48.280 --> 1:54:52.920]  cities as homeless, and to use drugs and alcohol and engage in petty crime. It's because the
[1:54:52.920 --> 1:54:58.760]  globalist admit under agenda 21, agenda 2030, of course the gray reset, they want to lower
[1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:02.840]  expectations. They don't want you to think of having sanitary systems everywhere. They don't want
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:07.080]  you to think of a civilization that gets better. They want you to think of civilization that gets
[1:55:07.080 --> 1:55:12.760]  progressively worse. The globalist fly around in private jets, they have huge private mistakes.
[1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:17.880]  They are separate from us. Their children go to private tutors. They admit this. Now they want
[1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:23.640]  us locked down, telecommunicating with each other so that we are not actually out physically
[1:55:23.640 --> 1:55:28.440]  building a pro human infrastructure. The infrastructure that's left under 5G has been
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:33.640]  to control robot autonomous cars and trucks. This is all their admitted plan. The public's
[1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:38.520]  finally listening because the plan is no longer in beta. It's gone operational. It's a post human
[1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:54.440]  future. You better find out about it right now. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:07.080]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Owen shroyer is here with us.
[1:56:07.080 --> 1:56:13.560]  We are black. It's crazy. We have a shot over the Capitol. We've been here like three hours live.
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:18.440]  Even before we did my show. And the sun is like sat right there. Like other times the sun moved
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:23.400]  around was in front of us. It just sits there. Something about the the winner and the elliptical
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:26.680]  or something proof of the Flat Earth, Alex. I think it's proof of the flat. I think the sun
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:30.120]  has stopped today or something because I've been here for three, four hours. That sun's only
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:34.040]  moved like that much. I mean, something's going on here. But it is it is kind of an illustration
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:39.400]  of time moving slow. Like the next the next 12 days, Trump's final days are going to move really
[1:56:39.400 --> 1:56:44.040]  slow. But then when it's all done, it's going to seem like, you know, oh my gosh, like it's a whole
[1:56:44.040 --> 1:56:49.000]  2020 was it's like 2020 felt like the young longest year of my life. But now that I'm out of it, it
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  feels like it never even happened. It feels like 2020 didn't even happen. We're in a time warp.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:58.280]  Yeah, you know, and you know, and I think that one example that, you know, just in a generalization
[1:56:58.280 --> 1:57:02.440]  of everything that we're witnessing here, Alex, I'm really excited to start taking calls. You know,
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:05.560]  when when we get back in studio and everything, and I know you're going to start taking calls now,
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:10.600]  but tomorrow and the rest of the week. But third word, this is what happened in third,
[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:15.000]  this is what happens in third world countries. So when you get a government that starts acting
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.600]  like a third world communist country, you're going to get the people that start acting like it's
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:22.520]  a third world communist country. And then you're going to have the police force and everything
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:26.760]  turned into when the Muslims were storming capitals and taking over to the Arab Spring
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:31.400]  and blowing up churches, the media is like, Oh, it's so beautiful. But then when people go and
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:36.040]  do that here, oh my God, it's the end of the world. Let's be clear about this. It's not even just
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:42.120]  the left promoting that, whether it's, you know, overseas or here domestically, they funded it.
[1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:47.320]  Barack Obama sent hundreds of millions of dollars at the time they said moderate rebels,
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:52.200]  they knew who they were. In fact, now there's actually congressional investigations summer
[1:57:52.200 --> 1:57:57.560]  next door to us. They're actually, oh, yeah, the big, the big Al Jazeera over here, our friends
[1:57:57.560 --> 1:58:05.080]  actually, but seriously, but seriously, look, they run Barack Obama sent hundreds of millions
[1:58:05.080 --> 1:58:09.400]  of dollars to fund moderate rebels in Syria and the Middle East. And now congressional
[1:58:09.400 --> 1:58:14.440]  investigations are being done, finding out that no, they knew those were terrorist and they knew
[1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:18.600]  they were actually one trust wants to pull out, they lie to him and don't pull out. And think
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:23.400]  about we got a real president. He wasn't perfect, but my God was he real. And now we've crapped
[1:58:23.400 --> 1:58:28.520]  all over it. And now can you imagine how they're going to persecute us under Biden? He's saying,
[1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:32.920]  oh, the mass never come off. You're never leaving your house. It's over. I mean, wow,
[1:58:32.920 --> 1:58:36.120]  look at his war cabinet. He already has it assembled. Everything that Trump's done,
[1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:39.960]  all the peace in the Middle East, that's gone. That's gone. I probably probably within a year.
[1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:43.320]  I mean, we're going to be over there harvesting poppy fields. We're going to be bringing back
[1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:47.000]  heroin to the United States. That's what we're going to be doing once again. And then, you know,
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:52.600]  that's how sad it is to that here's Trump taking up one of the biggest leftist and fair enough,
[1:58:52.600 --> 1:58:56.840]  anybody wants to stop war. He's taken that mantle to stop these wars and actually have peace and
[1:58:56.840 --> 1:59:02.600]  they hate him for it. But you know, this is my fear. The propaganda is so thick and has been so
[1:59:04.200 --> 1:59:07.960]  lengthy against Trump for four years and Trump supporters, whether these people like Biden or
[1:59:07.960 --> 1:59:13.800]  not, they're going to look at him as the hero that stopped the racist Hitler. And so he's going to
[1:59:13.800 --> 1:59:19.480]  be worshiped and brought in like, oh, my gosh, he saved us. Oh, my gosh, we love him. And it's
[1:59:19.480 --> 1:59:22.840]  just like the weirdest thing. And then they're going to look at us like you said, Alex, and they're
[1:59:22.840 --> 1:59:27.160]  going to be coming. I mean, and they're going to feel justified. And they're going to get praised by
[1:59:27.160 --> 1:59:30.360]  the mainstream media. They're going to get praised by the Biden administration. And they're
[1:59:30.360 --> 1:59:34.760]  going to say, you've done a good job. Go hunt Trump supporters. It's affirmed. Great job. Well,
[1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:37.960]  all I got to say is the hunting is not going to go too well. Because when they physically
[1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:41.320]  start it, we're going to finish it. Well, they don't realize that we are the party of the Second
[1:59:41.320 --> 1:59:45.160]  Amendment. It was exactly what you were saying. It's not just that they're setting him up to
[1:59:45.160 --> 1:59:52.040]  cure COVID to be the savior of COVID to, you know, the 350k lives lost, you know, he is these people's
[1:59:52.040 --> 1:59:55.400]  saver. This is the one that he's going to cure the pandemic. And that's exactly what they're
[1:59:55.400 --> 1:59:58.600]  going to do. Once he's inaugurated, you're not even going to hear about it. And they'll give
[1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:01.560]  China here. Here's what I think is going to happen to excited. You're right. But I think it's next
[2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:05.560]  level. They're going to say they're already building this narrative. They're going to say,
[2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:11.720]  wow, Trump blew it. He blew it with the pandemic. And now he blew it with the vaccines. Oh, my gosh,
[2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:16.680]  we need China. And then China is going to bring in the vaccines. And Joe's going to say, thank
[2:00:16.680 --> 2:00:21.240]  God, see, this is why we need a relationship with China. What Trump did with China is bad.
[2:00:21.240 --> 2:00:25.800]  We have to be in good terms with China. They're great. They have the vaccines that saved us.
[2:00:25.800 --> 2:00:29.240]  Thank you, China. We're out of the pandemic. And then the media will go right and locks.
[2:00:29.240 --> 2:00:35.080]  In a matter of one year, if that we will go from an America first movement to a China first movement.
[2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:39.560]  He already said, people go, Oh, that's edited. No, it's the full speech. He goes,
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:43.720]  I don't like America first. We shouldn't have that. Well, I mean, come on, folks,
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:47.160]  that's a corporate race is trying to get you to hate yourself. We'll be right back. We'll take

[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:51.000]  and you notice that he said we've got a shut down alternative conservative ecosystems that's how
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:55.240]  this riot happened no you hijacked our beautiful rally and got a little bit of a riot going and
[2:04:55.240 --> 2:04:59.960]  now you're saying you've survived World War two and you're a hero and you defeated you know Hydra
[2:04:59.960 --> 2:05:05.480]  and Red Skull and Hitler and Pearl Harbor no they're just mad that we've circumvented their
[2:05:05.480 --> 2:05:11.000]  censorship big media big tech has failed they're a joke they're a fraud they thought if we went away
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:15.640]  they'd be pertinent again they would matter again they don't matter they're a fraud and they're a
[2:05:15.640 --> 2:05:20.600]  joke everybody knows it so I'll take a few calls here but how big is that how big is that Owen
[2:05:20.600 --> 2:05:25.560]  that that that Obama says we've got to shut down the alternative media ecosystem they listed info
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:30.520]  wars they listed newsmax who's not even they're okay they listed oan who's great they listed
[2:05:30.520 --> 2:05:35.240]  uh gateway pundit I mean there's not many people out there hey broad used to be a great guy came
[2:05:35.240 --> 2:05:39.400]  to studio knows going Trump wouldn't financially support him or whatever he got what's seeing him
[2:05:39.400 --> 2:05:45.960]  by him out I'm told my point is there's not many holdouts out there well I think just as angry
[2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:50.360]  as you know we the people are at everything that's going down I think that also you know there's an
[2:05:50.360 --> 2:05:56.120]  element on the other side of fear I mean I really believe that they're Biden is scared that Obama
[2:05:56.120 --> 2:06:00.280]  is scared Schumer Pelosi I do believe that they're afraid not because we're violent that's not why
[2:06:00.280 --> 2:06:06.440]  they're afraid they're afraid because their corruption is now fully out in the open and people
[2:06:06.440 --> 2:06:11.240]  like you said the censorship isn't working so we still organize and activated a million people
[2:06:11.240 --> 2:06:15.640]  in DC we still have people go into the Capitol buildings every Saturday they thought they could
[2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:21.000]  end those transmissions and stop the movement from happening it didn't work so they've been fully
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:26.520]  exposed I mean the corruption with Biden and China and Obama like that's that's out there in spy gate
[2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:32.200]  but I mean even even the stuff with the Epstein white logs and everybody involved this is all
[2:06:32.200 --> 2:06:36.360]  total defeat of them and now that's what I want to say here because I've been pregnant with anger
[2:06:36.360 --> 2:06:40.920]  pregnant with with frustration to say this and I've been and I've been being a little mad to
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:47.320]  everybody that doesn't do with you guys I'm just so pissed ready for war is that we won folks we won
[2:06:47.320 --> 2:06:51.960]  Trump won the globalist are in trouble they're a joker hunchback demons look at Chuckie Schumer
[2:06:51.960 --> 2:06:57.640]  look at look at all these people look at Pelosi their jokes look at Biden these people are sick
[2:06:57.640 --> 2:07:04.920]  unbelievable filthy jokes at every single level and that's what this comes down to and and so as
[2:07:04.920 --> 2:07:10.360]  bad as all this is at least we're putting up a fight at least we're down here at least they're
[2:07:10.360 --> 2:07:14.120]  crapping their bridges even though we didn't want the violence they let into it I mean once their
[2:07:14.120 --> 2:07:18.200]  own people let us into violence they crap their bridges and so let's just understand we're in the
[2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:23.240]  fight this is historical we're not going down without a fight and we're actually winning culturally
[2:07:23.240 --> 2:07:27.800]  because we're the rock stars we're the outlaw country we're the outlaw rock and roll folks you
[2:07:27.800 --> 2:07:34.920]  are and and and so understand that and just know that we've only begun to fight and you know continuing
[2:07:34.920 --> 2:07:39.560]  the pressure and not giving up I mean you know well again Trump Trump is in control of his own
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:45.000]  fate but we can still be in control of the fate of America it just maybe gets a lot more difficult
[2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:50.600]  from here and with every day that passes but yeah I mean there is an element to us having the victories
[2:07:50.600 --> 2:07:54.440]  they're just not telling us they're not letting you gotta remember that and God's on our side
[2:07:54.440 --> 2:07:58.280]  these are Satanists they're always gonna fail they're just deployed to destroy human life
[2:07:58.280 --> 2:08:06.120]  by this by this force let's talk to some callers here Patriot in DC Patriot you're in you're on
[2:08:06.120 --> 2:08:15.560]  the year go ahead thank you what took place is obvious script play from the time that we had the
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:23.320]  celebration yesterday with Trump and they set him up because the tweet I was sent out earlier on
[2:08:23.320 --> 2:08:28.360]  of him saying hey this is gonna be a big day they took advantage of that they went ahead and activated
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:35.160]  Antifa to be there to start the riots before the true Patriots went there to peacefully protest
[2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:42.920]  and what took place was the script play when the Senate was taken over the military came in
[2:08:43.720 --> 2:08:50.520]  after that then once they got everything quelled they initiate the curfew Patriots came back
[2:08:50.520 --> 2:08:56.120]  hold back forces then what took place with the Senate came out and each one of the Senate members
[2:08:56.120 --> 2:09:01.720]  started reading off their scripts of as if they had this speech prepared of what took place they
[2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:08.760]  started changing their their role and what needs to take place next is Trump has a commander in
[2:09:08.760 --> 2:09:13.720]  chief under the foreign interference executive order that is still in place he needs to go
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:21.320]  ahead and send an order order to the USO com and activate death group and he needs to activate
[2:09:21.320 --> 2:09:30.120]  ODA teams and simultaneously um arrest all of the traitors um with all of the because the enemy
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:36.840]  has manifested itself we know at this point this far in the game who the enemy is and there's
[2:09:36.840 --> 2:09:42.920]  plenty of evidence to show that and we need to use that can you use USO com he has full authority
[2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:48.680]  to do that and that's one way that we can maybe move forward well sir god bless you and and here's
[2:09:48.680 --> 2:09:53.560]  the deal we're under chi com takeover anyways i don't like any of this happening but i agree
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:57.960]  trump has that power the question is will he he can't even get a march to go to a capital
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:02.360]  without it being hijacked can he count on the military brass the top i know he can count on
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:06.920]  the troops that are low level and mid level but that really is where we are people can feel it
[2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:11.720]  we're going under bondage it i mean this is finally yet i mean you can hear the church bells
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:16.600]  going off over here this is the story well and also um you know this isn't just a group of people
[2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:20.520]  randomly going around beating random people up or destroying businesses or looting or burning
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:25.640]  buildings i mean these are people that went to the scene of the crime the election was being stolen
[2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:30.200]  right there so they just went to the scene of the crime we didn't even plan on going in it just
[2:10:30.200 --> 2:10:34.200]  kind of happened with the setup and everything but they went to the scene of the crime and so this
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:38.600]  is really the most dangerous aspect of this and why i think there's a lot of frustration
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:43.400]  between trump supporters and the dc police um not just the physical confrontations but i mean
[2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:50.040]  imagine now they the democrats have control they have control of the entire security nanny state
[2:10:50.040 --> 2:10:55.800]  apparatus where even when you show up to the scene of their crime they can send in their forces to
[2:10:55.800 --> 2:10:59.800]  stop you i mean that's like having the chinese military i'm not saying the police are the chinese
[2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:04.760]  military i'm saying it's it's the same equivalent of having the chinese absolutely all right caller
[2:11:04.760 --> 2:11:09.080]  you met an incredible point oan is going to take a break he's going to be hosting the fourth hour

[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:28.280]  this very very closely so i wanted to get her on to continue to show how people are on target
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:32.760]  showing that antifa is this shadow terrorist group that's being used to take down our republic

[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:56.440]  could be coming especially if the globalist are successful in killing the dollar tens of millions

[2:14:44.600 --> 2:14:50.920]  the democratic impulses just because we signed on to legal briefs and asked courts to resolve
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:55.240]  disputes there were some on the left who said that we should not even be seated in the body
[2:14:55.880 --> 2:15:03.240]  that we ought to be prosecuted baby even jailed those arguments anger people but people do
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:10.920]  understand the concepts of basic fairness and no competition contest or election can be deemed
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:18.440]  fair if the participants are subject to different rules baseball teams that cheat and steal signs
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:24.040]  should be stripped of their championships russian olympians who cheat and use steroids
[2:15:24.040 --> 2:15:29.720]  should be stripped of their medals and states that do not run clean elections should be stripped
[2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:38.680]  of their electors this fraud was systemic it was repeated it was the same system and i dare
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:44.440]  say it was effective we saw circumstances where when democrat operatives couldn't get the outcomes
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:49.880]  they wanted in state legislators when they couldn't get the job done there they went and pressured
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:55.960]  and litigated and usurped the constitution with extra constitutional action of some
[2:15:55.960 --> 2:16:02.920]  officials in some states they fraudulently la laundered ballots votes voter registration forms
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:09.800]  and then they limited review in 2016 democrats found out that they couldn't beat
[2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:16.520]  donald trump at the ballot box with voters who actually show up so they turned to impeachment
[2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:23.480]  and the witness box and when that failed they ran to the mailbox where this election saw an
[2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:30.200]  unprecedented amount of votes that could not be authenticated with true id with true signature
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:35.960]  match and with true confidence for the american people our article three courts have failed
[2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:43.320]  by not holding evidentiary hearings to weigh the evidence we should not join in that failure
[2:16:43.320 --> 2:16:48.760]  we should vindicate the rights of states we should vindicate the subpoenas in arizona that
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:53.720]  have been issued to get a hold of these voting machines and we should reject these electors
[2:16:53.720 --> 2:17:04.680]  i yield back this is january fifth the night of jibra about to go into another one of these
[2:17:04.680 --> 2:17:09.400]  constitutional dates january six tomorrow and we still don't have an outcome for the united
[2:17:09.400 --> 2:17:15.240]  states of america to not have the outcome of an election for our ability our all the capabilities
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:21.560]  that we have i i have actually been part of taken over countries or running elections in
[2:17:21.560 --> 2:17:26.120]  countries in other countries around the world where we say hey well be more like us act more
[2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:31.160]  like us in fact we're going to show you how to do an election free your country iraq in your
[2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:36.520]  country afghanistan in your country name the central american country in the in the eighties
[2:17:36.520 --> 2:17:43.160]  in the nineties so anyway i just this is embarrassing i totally agree with you and under the us law
[2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:48.520]  under the state department under the un if they're not poll watchers if there's not you redo the
[2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:52.680]  election to politics because i'm a politician i get into politics because i care about the
[2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:58.120]  future of the country there was i saw the country going towards socialism while i was in uniform
[2:17:58.120 --> 2:18:05.960]  so that's why i i felt so strongly about getting involved in the political process because i knew
[2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:10.920]  if we went a different direction we wouldn't have this conversation there's a dna in the american
[2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:27.320]  psyche and in the american culture that still exists and that dna goes all the way back to 1776
[2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:38.280]  general michael flinn is here with us former head of defense intelligence agency
[2:18:38.280 --> 2:18:43.080]  former national security adviser to president trump someone attacked and demonized by the

[2:19:06.280 --> 2:19:11.720]  mind when i'm asked on a scale of one to ten what's what's the scale that you put that trump will
[2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:16.840]  be the next president i say ten without a doubt that is the truth everybody in this country everybody
[2:19:16.840 --> 2:19:22.600]  in the world knows that this election on the third of november was a total ripoff it was a fraudulent
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:27.160]  election we have had foreign interference from multiple countries i'll rattle them off here if
[2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:33.080]  you want to get into that and uh and donald trump was the clear winner for the next four days after
[2:19:33.080 --> 2:19:37.160]  the third of november from about the fourth through the seventh eighth of november they just
[2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:42.280]  started stuffing the ballot boxes and everybody knows it and they got caught they got caught with
[2:19:42.280 --> 2:19:47.400]  their hands in the proverbial cookie jar so that's where we are just like they got caught on russia
[2:19:47.400 --> 2:19:51.800]  gay just like everything everything russia gay so you got the fortune general lay it out for people
[2:19:51.800 --> 2:19:57.720]  what really happened yeah so on on the in terms of the election what we know is that the election
[2:19:57.720 --> 2:20:05.160]  was won by donald trump that night approximately 10 o'clock 10 30 at night 80 to 90 of the precincts
[2:20:05.160 --> 2:20:11.320]  in nationwide trump won hands down hands down and then all of a sudden we had this very very
[2:20:11.320 --> 2:20:15.880]  uncertain you know the everything stops we've never had that in our country in our in our
[2:20:15.880 --> 2:20:24.440]  presidential election so five states shut down joe biden goes to bed i mean he probably never
[2:20:24.440 --> 2:20:33.000]  came out of the basement and so um then what happened was they realized they'd be in the democratic
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:39.240]  machine they realized that the algorithms that they put into these dominion machines and these
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:46.120]  what's called e s and s which is electronic security systems 95 percent of the of the electronic
[2:20:46.120 --> 2:20:52.440]  voting done in this country is done by those two systems dominion and e s and s okay the majority
[2:20:52.440 --> 2:20:57.320]  of people in this country don't even realize that those machines are bar and the companies behind
[2:20:57.320 --> 2:21:03.160]  them are partially owned by the chinese communist party and you said that you said that months ago
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:07.880]  now it was confirmed i saw the day that they've congress has proven they're connected chinese
[2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:12.920]  communist party they're connecting to china the communist chinese party paid 200 million in 2014
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:18.440]  to dominion and they and they paid in october i believe it was october of 2020 another 400 million
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:26.120]  dollars put into this company so so we have we have clear evidence of a foreign interference
[2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:33.560]  which is all the the president's executive order describes in and that's the executive order from
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:41.160]  2018 he reinstituted it in 2019 he reinstituted it again in 2020 and so we are essentially in a
[2:21:41.160 --> 2:21:46.200]  national emergency that the president has already declared he just has to decide whether to execute
[2:21:46.200 --> 2:21:52.360]  some of those procedures that that are within well within his authority so we have foreign
[2:21:52.360 --> 2:21:57.160]  interference from china we have foreign interference from syria we have foreign interference from
[2:21:57.160 --> 2:22:05.080]  italy from spain from germany and then on the on the 30th of october 2020 so a couple of days before
[2:22:05.080 --> 2:22:11.320]  the the third of november election and then on the third of november the fbi and cisa which is that
[2:22:11.320 --> 2:22:16.360]  guy krebs right krebs who came out and said hey there's no foreign interference at all about a week
[2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:23.320]  after the election cisa is a homeland security cyber security agency on the 30th of october 2020
[2:22:23.320 --> 2:22:29.400]  and on the third of november both in what's called a joint intelligence advisory the fbi and cisa
[2:22:29.400 --> 2:22:36.040]  issued an advisory saying that iran is mucking around in our this is just part of the general
[2:22:36.040 --> 2:22:40.920]  flinn interview that we have a band on video and i'm really trying to get general flinn now in this
[2:22:40.920 --> 2:22:45.320]  crisis to come back on the u.s. expertise he's a great guy and really smart we'll be back with
[2:22:45.320 --> 2:22:51.000]  more of your calls straight ahead you must guard your humanity you must guard your children's humanity
[2:22:51.880 --> 2:22:56.360]  you must guard the very genetic code of the planet the globalists have set themselves up as the
[2:22:56.360 --> 2:23:01.720]  guardians of this world but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system poisoning the
[2:23:01.720 --> 2:23:08.120]  planet they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth
[2:23:08.120 --> 2:23:15.160]  to the gmo crops and now they've moved on to their main target too madly with the mRNA vaccines
[2:23:15.160 --> 2:23:23.960]  which are not vaccines they are recombinant dna from aborted cloned fetuses were then inserted
[2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:32.680]  into your genome to take over your body's systems go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines
[2:23:32.680 --> 2:23:38.920]  and then remember you've been warned this is the equivalent of an alien takeover whether it's
[2:23:38.920 --> 2:23:42.360]  interdimensional whether it's little green men the globalists are acting like another
[2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:50.120]  species that's overtaking us and overriding us it's all the same in the end the word apocalypse
[2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:57.880]  means the revealing of what was once hidden and now that all the lies are being revealed
[2:23:57.880 --> 2:24:06.280]  what will you do we know that millions will do absolutely nothing they will do whatever they
[2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:14.120]  are told as if obedience is a virtue it is the patriots of the world versus everybody else

[2:28:16.360 --> 2:28:20.600]  making us wear a mask sorry if i sound a little buffalo it's okay brother i understand go ahead
[2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:25.720]  if they just turn your audio i can hear you yes brother i came all the way here from seattle where
[2:28:25.720 --> 2:28:30.920]  i've watched my city burn to the ground at various spots i've seen police cars burned to the ground
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:36.760]  i've seen real riots what happened yesterday was not a riot it was an example of a frustrated
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:41.400]  people just showing up to their house and exercising their right to protest tensions
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:46.280]  didn't even really get crazy and riot until that poor woman got shot which you know most of us
[2:28:46.280 --> 2:28:50.120]  standing right outside of the front doors didn't even hear it happen we didn't even so when that
[2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:54.760]  information finally started filling out to the rest of us outside you know we didn't know what
[2:28:54.760 --> 2:29:00.040]  to believe and you know wasn't too much longer after that the police forced everybody you know
[2:29:00.040 --> 2:29:05.480]  slowly off the off the grounds completely but anyway i was just calling in i was really quick
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:09.400]  i ain't got very much longer to talk but they're already trying to spend the narrative and make
[2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:14.360]  it seem like anyone that was standing outside that building is a terrorist and i'm on my way back
[2:29:14.360 --> 2:29:20.680]  to seattle where most people probably feel that way and uh i just i'm really thankful for you and
[2:29:20.680 --> 2:29:25.640]  uh i really uh i just i just don't want you to burn out and have a heart attack or something
[2:29:25.640 --> 2:29:30.040]  brother i keep going and don't let these people take the narrative and spin it into us being
[2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:34.600]  terrorists that's really all i know they're not i love you and i love the crew i love you
[2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:38.680]  totally historic and insane and i'm glad you were there to see the truth and know what really
[2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:44.200]  happened yeah they killed four patriots who went into the capital blm does that and if it does that
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:49.960]  pink lives matter or whatever it's called code pink does that absolutely and they came and shot
[2:29:49.960 --> 2:29:54.440]  people they escalated it and trump needs to get on the offense instead of apologizing to the
[2:29:54.440 --> 2:29:58.840]  mainstream media i agree with you thank you will and dc have a great flight great job coming out
[2:29:58.840 --> 2:30:04.200]  here it was historic it was amazing we've only begun to expose this all right ryan in the great
[2:30:04.200 --> 2:30:11.320]  state of texas ryan welcome sir hey alec i just wanted to start off by thanking you for your
[2:30:11.320 --> 2:30:18.280]  service there in uh dc and i wanted to send prayers out to especially the family of ashley
[2:30:18.280 --> 2:30:27.000]  babbit and the other patriots that lost lost their lives yesterday um i i sound like an
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:35.400]  armchair quarterback but i was very afraid that that provoked tour action would occur yesterday
[2:30:35.400 --> 2:30:40.120]  and i think that my first indication was that they had only got to the objection on the arizona
[2:30:40.120 --> 2:30:46.680]  account when all this really popped off and that didn't really make sense to me why they wouldn't
[2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:52.920]  let that cross real patriots wouldn't would it just let that process continue in my opinion
[2:30:52.920 --> 2:31:00.120]  oh there's no doubt anti-facame and started fights with the police there's no doubt anti-facame
[2:31:00.120 --> 2:31:04.040]  and then triggered the police to attack the crowd so some went in and they're like hey we're just
[2:31:04.040 --> 2:31:08.120]  going in the capital like they did in wisconsin like they did in michigan and then they started
[2:31:08.120 --> 2:31:13.800]  shooting people and then it got crazy that's exactly what happened brother yeah and uh i
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:19.800]  guess now i'm kind of wondering why turn up like why don't you keep trying to brother i'm sorry
[2:31:19.800 --> 2:31:25.640]  my audio is so low i can't hear you i'm gonna have to put you on pause i'm gonna put you on hold
[2:31:25.640 --> 2:31:29.800]  until we can get that audio boosted up in my airpieces there's there's it sounds like the
[2:31:29.800 --> 2:31:34.200]  building's blowing up it's rattling we've got police cars racing around and hey guys what's
[2:31:34.200 --> 2:31:45.480]  happening down here so the police right now are making a crowd leave by the capital statue let's
[2:31:45.480 --> 2:31:49.480]  get some footage of that i know you guys are doing a great job let's take over and show this
[2:31:49.480 --> 2:31:56.840]  we're able to get this i know we're up here we got a limited crew here but yeah there's a bunch
[2:31:56.840 --> 2:32:02.440]  of police action because you can't let americans congregate not right wingers now they were shooting
[2:32:02.440 --> 2:32:10.200]  cops or burning buildings or burning down public housing and be okay but they got the police hurting
[2:32:10.200 --> 2:32:15.960]  people away from a statue not allowing congregation that is martial law okay sorry caller going back
[2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:21.240]  to you to finish up again i'm half deaf so i may have to retire but uh it's not the crew's fault
[2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:26.600]  that i can't hear you but just go ahead what else are you gonna say ryan so i guess i'm just wondering
[2:32:26.600 --> 2:32:32.040]  what trump's waiting for at this point and why why can't we just do something whether we're not
[2:32:32.040 --> 2:32:37.880]  gonna please everybody so let's do what's right what's best for the country and if he can well i
[2:32:37.880 --> 2:32:42.840]  think he's waiting on jeff sessions and bill bar i think jeff bill bar jeff sessions mic bench trust
[2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:47.720]  the plan what do you think the q folks are going to do when trump's gone are they going to secretly
[2:32:47.720 --> 2:32:52.920]  say biden is q and he's good and the gg ping's actually q and gg ping's gonna save us do you
[2:32:52.920 --> 2:33:01.000]  think q will endorse gg ping what do you think i think that's the q thing is uh they obviously use
[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:09.480]  that as the catalyst for what happened yesterday they said that it was q and on's and you know
[2:33:09.480 --> 2:33:16.200]  that could have called that one uh so the poor woman that got killed ashley babbitt was a huge
[2:33:16.200 --> 2:33:21.080]  q person he was a great person of veteran air force he cared she believed it she thought we're
[2:33:21.080 --> 2:33:27.080]  gonna beat it it's real we're gonna beat the new world order we're gonna do it q says attack
[2:33:27.080 --> 2:33:32.840]  and then auntie was saying attack q saying attack attack attack attack and then she got killed
[2:33:32.840 --> 2:33:39.960]  and the auntie was celebrating it uh and it's disgusting and it's wrong but you know that's
[2:33:39.960 --> 2:33:45.080]  where we are brother i appreciate your call i guess they started like a generator on the
[2:33:45.080 --> 2:33:49.720]  building or something maybe the power went out but my god this sounds like i'm inside a diesel
[2:33:49.720 --> 2:33:53.960]  engine over here luckily we have gates on these equipments you can't it hell alga's ears right
[2:33:53.960 --> 2:33:58.360]  here seeing ends over there so they must be hearing bomb bomb bomb bomb i don't know if you can hear
[2:33:58.360 --> 2:34:03.080]  this but it's definitely going down alex in florida you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:09.080]  alex let me start by saying that uh everything happening right now is absolutely disgusting
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:14.760]  and i'm saying it right now for everybody who can hear my voice i will never ever respect
[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:20.440]  joe biden or recognize joe biden as my president neither him or kamala harris this is a blatant
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:25.960]  fraud it's completely disgusting and i always try to tell people to tune into your movie on amazon
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:31.800]  prime america i know that you and norris you guys you know did your thing producing it back in 2016
[2:34:31.800 --> 2:34:36.680]  i went and watched it when it was live in theaters if people really can't see what's about to happen
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:40.200]  they should go and watch it because i know a lot of people are visual learners and you know
[2:34:40.200 --> 2:34:45.880]  they kind of just need to see it in a theatrical form to see what would happen if america went down
[2:34:45.880 --> 2:34:50.680]  in the way that it would go down because everything that is a fun cheesy chuck norris movie or you know
[2:34:50.680 --> 2:34:56.680]  mike norris movie the only way they can do it and uh but yeah it does show a un takeover
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:35:00.680]  of americans a great movie i was honored to be in it and and that's what we're witnessing we're
[2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:05.560]  witnessing a globalist takeover and then a bunch of americans showed up and four of them got killed
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:10.360]  and we're the terrorists no nobody's buying this crap they were pissed off americans in their house
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:16.920]  saying no and trump shouldn't be running away from this and uh also too i don't know if these
[2:35:16.920 --> 2:35:22.840]  numbers were accurate but i was watching everything live on your radio show yesterday and congratulations

[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:02.920]  that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went looked at the
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:09.160]  ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains quercetin which according to some
[2:37:09.160 --> 2:37:16.120]  published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:21.160]  and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look at that
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:28.520]  the all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:32.440]  through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:36.200]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:41.160]  we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks
[2:37:41.160 --> 2:37:41.880]  thanks for the plug

[2:37:50.520 --> 2:37:55.960]  other dictionaries have similar ones terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:38:02.920]  force for a political or financial reason it's basically scaring the hell out of people
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:08.360]  until you submit to them that's exactly what all this overblown covid 19 garbage is you see the

[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:28.040]  in our election on election day by the country of iran so for anybody to say that we haven't
[2:41:28.040 --> 2:41:33.080]  had foreign interference is is full of it there's there is our u.s. government agencies whether you
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:39.480]  want to trust the fbi or not i i have my my doubts about the fbi but regardless general
[2:41:40.600 --> 2:41:47.000]  as you said we have them claiming that russians got trump elected with no evidence now we have
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:56.040]  the e you the communist chinese iran with these confucius institutes and all the i mean hell china
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:01.560]  tells hollywood what they can put in movies now yeah and they're all actually owns hollywood
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:06.280]  they own hollywood speak to that place you know they i mean the the the level of influence inside
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:11.800]  and the ownership i mean just the flat out ownership you know if people knew what the chinese
[2:42:11.800 --> 2:42:18.680]  party basically the chinese government was doing inside of this country for frankly the last 30
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:26.120]  years i mean it's it's astounding inside of our academic institutions it's in our in our banking
[2:42:26.120 --> 2:42:32.600]  systems in our tech systems and in our hollywood within hollywood or in our movie making capability
[2:42:32.600 --> 2:42:38.600]  so when you begin to look at at the and i would call it the real estate so if you look at what
[2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:45.320]  real estate is being purchased by china it exists in all walks of of of america's life and and i
[2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:50.120]  think the hollywood component of it is a big deal all you gotta do is look at some of these big
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:54.920]  companies that are that are living out in it that are living in folton county atlanta okay so why is
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:43:00.680]  folton county atlanta such a big deal right now why is there so much scrutiny being paid on on
[2:43:00.680 --> 2:43:06.120]  folton county atlanta which is one of the largest voting counties in the country in fact folton
[2:43:06.120 --> 2:43:11.320]  county maricopa county and wane county up in michigan maricopa county in arizona those are the
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:17.960]  top voting counties in the country this this election and what we know the chinese party has
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:22.760]  done not not since donald trump came into office but probably for the last 30 years certainly it's
[2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:28.840]  since the mid 90s since the clinton era of the mid 90s and what they have been doing when you think
[2:43:28.840 --> 2:43:34.040]  about it uh when i'll just talk about our academic institutions when you think about our colleges
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:39.320]  and universities graduate and undergraduate they've been sending upwards of about 300 000 students a
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:43.720]  year into into our institutions those are just students they come here from one year they go
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:47.640]  back home they come here for another year they go back home they graduate and they graduate in the
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:53.400]  science technology engineering and math arenas they're not keeping that that intellect here
[2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:58.520]  they're taking it right back home and they've been doing it for decades so they stole our brain
[2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:05.400]  trust the system moved heaven and earth to falsely indict you to keep you from giving trump good
[2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:10.840]  patriotic pro-american advice because you were somebody that believed in america and you were
[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:16.360]  not a traitor so now they try to silence you they fail you've come through the fires of phoenix
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:21.240]  what is your advice right now to president trump and the american people regardless of what happens
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:24.840]  the next 15 days yeah because they wanted to silence you for a reason because they knew you
[2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:29.240]  were a real person who cared about america they cared about truce so general flin they want to
[2:44:29.240 --> 2:44:35.080]  silence you have your voice here one of the one of the i'll tell you one of the pieces of the
[2:44:35.080 --> 2:44:39.720]  conversation i had with donald trump the day that he called me up about the party he says you
[2:44:39.720 --> 2:44:44.600]  says you're the cleanest guy in america he says you're probably the cleanest guy in the world
[2:44:44.600 --> 2:44:48.760]  and i said no donal you're the cleanest guy in the world because they have dug into your rear end
[2:44:48.760 --> 2:44:54.520]  so far and they found nothing and i said i i know that i know what what they would have found in my
[2:44:54.520 --> 2:44:59.480]  life and it's nothing you know it's maybe maybe some ugly fight that i get in when i was a kid
[2:44:59.480 --> 2:45:03.880]  in high school with a guy like you sometimes you know i don't know if i take you on that you probably
[2:45:03.880 --> 2:45:09.080]  maybe i'm sorry but i'm i'm i'm being a little facetious about that but that was part of it was
[2:45:09.080 --> 2:45:16.280]  that they dug into my life so far back and i'm i'm talking about back years oh i know i've gone
[2:45:16.280 --> 2:45:20.600]  through it too this isn't just started in 2017 or when the president won the last election they go
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:24.040]  into here everybody you're doing high school everybody everybody so they looked into every
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:28.680]  every single part of my life they were listening to all my communications or watching all my text
[2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:34.840]  looking at all my bank accounts everything they found nothing what they knew was is that i knew
[2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:40.680]  what they knew okay and i think that that's a that's a uh that's a powerful statement actually say
[2:45:40.680 --> 2:45:49.960]  that again exactly what they knew is what i is what i know what they know okay i mean essentially
[2:45:50.680 --> 2:45:58.440]  how this system operates when chuck schumer said that the intel about donald trump and he said that
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:02.840]  they have six ways to sunday right the intelligence community have six ways to sunday to basically
[2:46:02.840 --> 2:46:08.120]  screw you then that that ought to send a message that ought to send a chill down everybody's
[2:46:08.120 --> 2:46:13.320]  spine right in this country that should never be the case yet that is in fact the case and
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:18.360]  it's still the case in some degrees to some degree so what we're facing is we're facing
[2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:23.000]  institutions in this country that have that have lost sight of who they work for they work for the
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:27.720]  american people they work for we the people they don't work for the institution but that's what this
[2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:34.120]  town has become so why we call this the swamp why we call this the deep state the amount of corruption
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:39.960]  that we are now seeing that has been exposed by this election is outrageous it's it's despicable
[2:46:40.520 --> 2:46:45.320]  and and just to give you one little example because it outraged me today and i i've already
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:51.400]  spoken to a couple of different all right folks we are back live we are here with limited equipment
[2:46:51.400 --> 2:46:56.200]  because we got cut off at the marshal law lockdown and didn't get some of it uh and i'm about to go
[2:46:56.200 --> 2:47:00.760]  down and and show you the capital and what happened in the in the national guard and not letting
[2:47:00.760 --> 2:47:06.680]  citizens near the capital and the marshal law that's unfolding there's part of the general
[2:47:06.680 --> 2:47:10.680]  flinn interview our internet was down the building sounded like it was going to blow up i'm not
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:16.520]  kidding the whole building was like i'm shaking i've never been in a building that does that
[2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:20.680]  in fact oh and get over here am i lying about this the building's also going to blow up for 30
[2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:25.720]  minutes this is this is like an acid trip i'm not saying i'm taking acid but but my wife was totally
[2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:31.080]  right when she said yesterday this has been like an acid trip like yesterday was not real
[2:47:31.080 --> 2:47:35.800]  and biden stumbling around is not real and kamala eras isn't real i'm going to take a few calls and
[2:47:35.800 --> 2:47:40.680]  in this and i was going to take over he'll take a live skype fee whatever they tell him to because
[2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:45.400]  he won't be able to hear me i'll be down there on the ground i'll be able to hear him but this is
[2:47:45.400 --> 2:47:53.000]  just twilight zone on well it's totally surreal and there's like a there's a delicate balance between
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  accepting the reality and not going crazy or or trying to figure out how to deal with it in
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:04.760]  your own head versus just either rejecting it or trying to think you can escape it and so it's
[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:09.880]  like we're in this weird paradigm now where it's like totally twilight zone level everything is
[2:48:09.880 --> 2:48:14.680]  backwards everything is double standard but it's like okay you own turtles and how do you deal with
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:19.240]  it though i do own turtles that's a little weird and tortoises but that's actually reality no but
[2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:23.880]  but getting serious though it's like you know that's why all of these trump supporters i think
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:28.200]  or q people are kind of you know what what kind of emotions are they going through i mean what
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:32.440]  realizations are they because we didn't look we didn't grow up in north korea or communist china or
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:37.240]  russia or venezuela and we're like really this is i can't go outside i gotta wear a mask really the
[2:48:37.240 --> 2:48:42.760]  virus is a fraud but i gotta take a shot yeah folks america's gone we killed all the babies we
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:47.160]  double worshiped and god took his support away we've got to fight back and take it back and so i
[2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:51.720]  want to say this i'm proud of the folks ones of the capital my friend to that capital so evil
[2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:55.160]  people under the declaration of independence had a right to absolutely burn to the ground
[2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:59.480]  i don't support that because i don't think this is a right move i want to take it back politically
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:03.960]  but the point is is that we're not the ones burning down police stations and killing people
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:08.680]  we're responding to that they started it the globalists started it and we're not ashamed of
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:13.720]  anything and trump should come out and expose antifa for triggering the riots and stand up against
[2:49:13.720 --> 2:49:19.320]  it fake pandemics where the death count doesn't increase television news it says peaceful protests
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:26.200]  as cities burn around them i mean you don't what do they think when they shoot and kill an armed
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:31.560]  woman and people and throw people off the 35 foot parapets to their death do they think people go oh
[2:49:31.560 --> 2:49:37.000]  i'm scared to go to the capital no dude crazy people start loading truck bombs up with plastic
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:42.520]  explosives dumbass and then we're bay root and they lock off square miles do not come to dc and
[2:49:42.520 --> 2:49:47.000]  attack it do not do truck bombs do not do mass shootings but the globalists are going to do it
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:52.920]  you can see with how they did this that this is where they're going well and the other crazy part
[2:49:52.920 --> 2:49:57.400]  about it too is the twilight zone level of of witnessing this history and understanding it but
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:02.360]  then the other aspect is is is dealing with the clones dealing with the zombies dealing with the
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:06.120]  sheeple that don't they don't even live you know alec you used to say this all the time i remember
[2:50:06.120 --> 2:50:09.640]  when i first tuned in you and i didn't really understand it at the time but these people
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:13.800]  literally don't even know what planet they're on sure okay they could say oh i'm on planet earth no
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:18.600]  no no it's like we're not a solar system they don't know about it and they have no building blocks
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:23.880]  people i remember my cousin she smarts works for ibm and she was like six years old i was like ten
[2:50:24.600 --> 2:50:28.600]  and we're sitting around eating t-bone steaks my dad go to mcgrill and she goes this is really
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:35.080]  good meat do they do they give the cow put the cow to sleep to do a surgery and i said yeah
[2:50:35.080 --> 2:50:40.440]  they do a surgery all right but i began to learn like adults don't think where's electricity come
[2:50:40.440 --> 2:50:46.360]  from like i was on joe rogan he's a smart guy but i'm on his show and i'm like he's like okay
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:51.000]  what about carbon taxes you know carbon's bad i go the whole earth's based on carbon it's the carbon
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:57.080]  cycle and plants you take on oxygen you create your or carbon dioxide put out oxygen and i said
[2:50:57.080 --> 2:51:05.560]  you know your tesla car uses more than an average mid-sized car because it's a sports car of power
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:11.400]  and a power plant transferred down the electrical line you lose about half of it and then he goes so
[2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:15.480]  the emissions aren't in the car they're at the plant he looked it up and couldn't believe it he never
[2:51:15.480 --> 2:51:19.880]  thought about that we'll be right back and take a few final calls owens gonna take over i'm gonna
[2:51:19.880 --> 2:51:25.800]  march down here in the marshal law and give me some live reports beamed back if we can but i mean
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:33.720]  that's what i'm talking about it's in the studies an electric car uses more power if it's coming from
[2:51:33.720 --> 2:51:40.200]  the main electrical transmission system fox has betrayed president trump as i predicted they would
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:45.080]  they've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse if they're able to
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:51.480]  keep trump from rightfully taking office for second term on jerry 20th the system is going to drop
[2:51:51.480 --> 2:51:56.120]  the hammer harder than ever on this republic they are going to explode gas prices they're
[2:51:56.120 --> 2:52:00.680]  going to shut down our cold power plants they're going to cut off the energy source to us so it's
[2:52:00.680 --> 2:52:06.280]  impossible for factories to move back here this is economic domination this is economic war we're
[2:52:06.280 --> 2:52:10.760]  being consolidated we're being taken over the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities
[2:52:10.760 --> 2:52:16.760]  and states they're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely
[2:52:16.760 --> 2:52:22.440]  to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property this is a monopolistic
[2:52:22.440 --> 2:52:27.480]  takeover that's what the great reset is clout swab and these other criminals admit it that's what
[2:52:27.480 --> 2:52:33.720]  social distancing is so your business is only a 25 for several more years no small businesses will
[2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:43.560]  be there this is a master plan say no the word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once
[2:52:43.560 --> 2:52:53.000]  hidden and now that all the lies are being revealed what will you do we know that millions
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:53:00.680]  will do absolutely nothing they will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue it is
[2:53:00.680 --> 2:53:09.320]  the patriots of the world versus everybody else i do solemnly swear that i will support and defend
[2:53:09.320 --> 2:53:16.600]  the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will bear
[2:53:16.600 --> 2:53:23.160]  true faith and allegiance to the same that i take this obligation freely without any mental
[2:53:23.160 --> 2:53:30.520]  reservation or purpose of evasion and that i will well and faithfully discharge my duties as best as
[2:53:30.520 --> 2:53:46.440]  i can so help me god info wars dot com bam dot video you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:53:46.440 --> 2:54:04.840]  and i gotta tell you i've been to dc more than last year than in my whole damn life and i'm
[2:54:04.840 --> 2:54:10.120]  sick of being here i was trolleyers by the takeover the fourth hour about to march down there and
[2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:15.640]  show you the aftermath of the hysteria yesterday but carlos and can has been calling for 15 years
[2:54:15.640 --> 2:54:21.640]  or so i know who he is he's a professional a well-known professional in his field and there's
[2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:25.640]  more people showing up more patriots right now so we're going to be going down there but carlos
[2:54:25.640 --> 2:54:30.600]  what should trump do with 13 days left what do you make of this whole situation you always
[2:54:30.600 --> 2:54:38.520]  decipher things in a very informative way well i want to tell you of a cover-up of essentially
[2:54:38.520 --> 2:54:45.080]  a covenant a two-party covenant and then what president trump can do in the next 12 30 to
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:51.000]  30 days first of all the cover-up and the covenant they said two-party covenant in united states like
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:57.560]  in other governments in parliaments in canada as well when one political party is about to be
[2:54:57.560 --> 2:55:03.000]  decimated as the democrats were sometime last year they did the statistics they tried everything
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:07.640]  and they were going to be really really beaten why because president trump is going to have a
[2:55:07.640 --> 2:55:14.120]  majority he was going to have a landslide why because he copied the 1980 model of president
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:21.400]  reagan reduced taxes and therefore at the end of four years you stimulate the economy and you have
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:28.920]  a reelection he deserved it he had the numbers and when they saw that the two-party covenant
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:34.920]  kicked in none of this fraud none of the takeover of the steel could have taken place
[2:55:34.920 --> 2:55:40.840]  without the republicans of mcconnell going along with it knowing fully well that we're going to do
[2:55:40.840 --> 2:55:46.120]  what they were going to do that they were going to add up whatever votes they needed and then they
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:51.320]  covered up with the covers that's why they were so confident to say no no evidence even the supreme
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:58.440]  court was aware of the fact that the two-party covenant this is the problem the next problem
[2:55:58.440 --> 2:56:04.440]  is that they fear president trump they're terrified of him they're terrified because he
[2:56:04.440 --> 2:56:13.800]  garnered as a legacy 74 and a quarter million people americans and they are terrified of his
[2:56:13.800 --> 2:56:19.880]  standing there when president biden in the dyes when he becomes president of the united states
[2:56:19.880 --> 2:56:27.880]  that president trump will represent a whole body of united americans who know very well what happened
[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:34.920]  under the two-party covenant what was done to this man jesus christ was crucified in 24 hours
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:44.360]  they did this to this man for four years carlos i couldn't say it better than you and i think
[2:56:44.360 --> 2:56:51.320]  trump should be defiant and not give in to these people and and really continue to control the
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:56.760]  republican party is in a populist way how does he balance that though alex when just like they did
[2:56:56.760 --> 2:57:00.920]  yesterday any any violence that happens i mean it doesn't matter they can literally send in a hundred
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:05.560]  of their own goons to burn down a building just to blame trump and the media will do it even if
[2:57:05.560 --> 2:57:11.000]  they're out there wearing antifa you know garb they'll still blame trump so i mean how does he
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:16.920]  how does he serve that delicate balance of being the strong leader and standing for what's right
[2:57:16.920 --> 2:57:21.480]  and and standing for the fair elections in the republic when he knows that their card is going
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:27.560]  to be start violence blame it on trump and continue to use that to try to move um i'll tell you they
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:32.200]  killed this poor lady ashley babbitt and they think we're just gonna forget about it we need to
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:38.040]  make a big deal about her she's a lot better poster child than george floyd sorry yeah anything else
[2:57:38.040 --> 2:57:47.800]  carlos trump carlos go ahead carlos sorry go ahead you played in and doing the rally he knows
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:53.800]  very well the role you played please give you an exclusive interview let president trump
[2:57:53.800 --> 2:58:00.200]  interview you and you him and ask each other what happened and what really really the american
[2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:06.360]  people should turn to info wars to get discernment because discernment is knowing when you're in a
[2:58:06.360 --> 2:58:11.880]  playing three-dimensional chess that you're in a four-dimensional chess game well and you know
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:17.000]  what that's the key here is it's not about trump interviews alex jones or alex it's about interfacing
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:22.200]  with the people that always had trumps back you know he tried to interfere interface with the swamp
[2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:25.880]  he tried to interface with mitch mcconnell and the republican party they stabbed in the back
[2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:29.480]  we've remained with trump doesn't mean we're not critical of him doesn't mean we think he's perfect
[2:58:29.480 --> 2:58:33.400]  we know his heart is in it we know we're in it for the right reasons so that's the interfacing
[2:58:33.400 --> 2:58:39.640]  that takes place now all right carlos great points own stroyer is about to take over and then i'm
[2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:46.920]  gonna march down there and show you what's happening on the ground stay with us our activated charcoal
[2:58:46.920 --> 2:58:52.280]  toothpaste became a best-seller overnight because activated charcoal is already one of the top
[2:58:52.280 --> 2:58:56.440]  selling fastest growing toothpaste out there the problem is a lot of the other over the counter
[2:58:56.440 --> 2:59:02.040]  ones have aspartame as their flavoring very very toxic and also they have fluoride in it this does
[2:59:02.040 --> 2:59:07.080]  not have the fluoride it doesn't have the additives this is a concentrated really is high quality it's
[2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:11.480]  been sold out for months because of supply chain breakdowns with the whole coveted martial law

[2:59:50.520 --> 3:00:02.360]  day after day alone on a hill the man with the foolish green is keeping perfectly still
[3:00:02.360 --> 3:00:13.480]  but nobody wants to know him they can see that he's just a fool and he never gives an answer
[3:00:13.480 --> 3:00:25.800]  but the fool on the hand sees the sun going down and the eyes in his head see the world spring
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:32.680]  round gentlemen we are back here on the alex jones show alex is about to head down to the capital
[3:00:33.560 --> 3:00:37.160]  obviously we don't have as many people out there as we did yesterday but there are some people out
[3:00:37.160 --> 3:00:43.320]  there gathering um a little bit of both actually i've seen some people drive by and blast uh f tromp
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:46.920]  it's i guess it's a rap song it just says f tromp for three minutes they were blasting it right
[3:00:46.920 --> 3:00:51.160]  outside uh but then another individual drove by with some trump flags out the truck and there
[3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:55.960]  is kind of a loud uh round of applause so there's still some activity here but i think most patriots
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:01:01.880]  are taking trumps heed uh taking info wars heed and it's time to get out of this hot zone now
[3:01:01.880 --> 3:01:07.640]  not as a retreat but as a strategic move knowing that we're being set up here knowing it's going
[3:01:07.640 --> 3:01:13.480]  to be used against us and knowing that the events of yesterday um didn't necessarily exactly go in
[3:01:13.480 --> 3:01:18.120]  our favor so if we're going to be in dc and we're going to try to stop the overthrow of our republic
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:23.160]  it needs to be measured it needs to be strategic and we can't be uh us led into a situation where
[3:01:23.160 --> 3:01:28.120]  we're going to be set up hey guys i don't have the list of callers in front of me i know we've
[3:01:28.120 --> 3:01:32.840]  got lines full of calls alex is heading down like i said to uh ground level we're going to be
[3:01:32.840 --> 3:01:36.920]  Skyping in with him in just a minute do you guys just want to tell me who's next on the line so
[3:01:36.920 --> 3:01:44.760]  we can get them going let's go to john in texas now john in texas you're on the alex joneshow go
[3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:52.280]  ahead hey oh and uh awesome man it's uh it's levin on john i met you uh uh can you hear me
[3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:59.560]  yeah loud and clear john okay so uh alex jones his instinct was right when he was getting mad
[3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:04.680]  earlier today and he was like man we should have stopped those agent provocateurs uh i think he's
[3:02:04.680 --> 3:02:10.120]  right about that because if you look at it like in a general sense donald trump would be like
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:14.360]  the leader you could call him like a warlord if you want to go back in like ancient european
[3:02:14.360 --> 3:02:20.360]  history all the warriors are loyal to the death loyal to the death to the warlord whatever command
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:26.760]  the warlord gives everyone will do it but the thing is is the warlord cannot give super subtle
[3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:33.560]  and nuanced orders he it's not possible he can only approach it with like a hammer but info wars
[3:02:33.560 --> 3:02:39.400]  and alex jones uh had the capability to be a little more nuanced a little more subtle uh to operate
[3:02:39.400 --> 3:02:45.240]  essentially like a ninja organization so i would like you know this mistake never to be repeated
[3:02:45.240 --> 3:02:50.600]  in the sense that next time we have a meetup we've got to have like info warriors uh people maybe
[3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:56.120]  with a specific uniform and their job is just anti false flag and they just got it well yeah let me
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:03:01.080]  actually let's actually yeah let's bear down on this topic because here's what happened yesterday
[3:03:01.080 --> 3:03:05.800]  that you're you're alluding to but let me put it out in a little more detail we had a million
[3:03:05.800 --> 3:03:12.040]  trump supporters in dc and whenever i'm coming to dc or really any of these events but more
[3:03:12.040 --> 3:03:17.720]  specifically like when i'm in dc or info wars is in dc for these events i get invited to speak at
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:23.320]  like 10 different deals um and so we obviously have our own deals where we're slated to speak and i
[3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:26.920]  need to be there and we've got the shows to do and all this stuff so i usually can't do it but my
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:31.800]  point is that all of these groups are organizing all of these groups are having their own rallies
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:36.200]  having their own stages set up and inviting all these different speakers and so because they
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:43.160]  can't get access to the main stage because the people that run the big main stages are mainstream
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:47.720]  conservative incorporated they're they're part of the republican establishment they're part of
[3:03:47.720 --> 3:03:52.360]  conservative incorporated as we call it and so the same people that organize a lot of these big
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:03:56.040]  things they had the big speakers and all the attention they're not actually in a fight for
[3:03:56.040 --> 3:04:01.000]  trump when he leaves office they'll go right back to being a republican establishment uh hacks so
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:06.200]  that's just kind of what's coming next but to get your point the only way we can actually do that
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:13.080]  john is have everybody on the same page and that's why what you're saying about trump is so key
[3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:17.880]  not everybody's gonna listen to info wars but when trump put out the call for people to leave
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:20.760]  they started leaving the capital doesn't mean everybody left but the point is they got the
[3:04:20.760 --> 3:04:25.720]  call they started leaving uh so they didn't like that so twitter shut them down the only way we
[3:04:25.720 --> 3:04:30.040]  could really do that is if we were all on the same page there's a million people at the wash
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:34.760]  department watching trump speak and then there's like another 30 000 at the capital and and we
[3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:38.600]  don't even know what's going on we're there watching trump speak listening to trump the people at
[3:04:38.600 --> 3:04:43.000]  the capital aren't even listening so it's like how does trump get them a message if he doesn't
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:48.840]  even know they're there while he's speaking or how does info wars get the message out while they're
[3:04:48.840 --> 3:04:53.880]  there to say hey look they're coming to set you up in a false flag style event make sure it doesn't
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:58.040]  happen if you see people starting violence make sure you try to stand them down or at least get
[3:04:58.040 --> 3:05:03.240]  it on video i mean it's just like trying to herd cats that's the problem we're all individual
[3:05:04.040 --> 3:05:09.720]  thinkers individual minded and so we got to find a way to kind of team up i think in these last
[3:05:09.720 --> 3:05:14.040]  12 days and i'm actually seeing a lot of that on the ground here of people building bridges
[3:05:14.040 --> 3:05:21.800]  coming together uh yeah alex wonders what what what are the people that follow q do once trump
[3:05:21.800 --> 3:05:25.080]  leaves office i mean i don't know they're they're actually the q people are online saying right now
[3:05:25.080 --> 3:05:29.640]  that he's actually in the middle of an insurrection act he let the democrats run around in the child
[3:05:29.640 --> 3:05:34.120]  pedophile trafficking tunnels under dc which is probably accurate but i don't think trump did that
[3:05:34.120 --> 3:05:37.480]  strategically um but yeah that's that's the challenge you're right john but that's the
[3:05:37.480 --> 3:05:42.040]  challenge is getting everybody on the same page and when you have the republican establishment
[3:05:43.240 --> 3:05:47.720]  trying to control this event they're going to black ball people from getting involved and
[3:05:47.720 --> 3:05:51.320]  that's what kind of lead to the separation where but there's multiple events happening rob do sitting
[3:05:51.320 --> 3:05:55.560]  down all right so i got on elevators forum with this lady she was did you see what linwood said
[3:05:55.560 --> 3:06:03.880]  on twitter i said no she goes he said trump has flown to texas into some emergency command bunker
[3:06:03.880 --> 3:06:08.120]  and there is where he's going to stay for the rest of my house yeah it could be at your house
[3:06:08.120 --> 3:06:14.520]  he's in the infomercial texas command center he's there trump is swimming in the pond in my backyard
[3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:18.920]  actually you can't really swim in it but he's bathing with my turtle no i i didn't see that from
[3:06:18.920 --> 3:06:23.000]  linwood no i didn't know that well that's what that's what some lady told me and she definitely had
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:27.320]  the q you know she had a q vibe to her i've i've met her most of the q people were really nice
[3:06:27.320 --> 3:06:30.680]  they're really nice people they're really nice people they've just bought into some of this stuff
[3:06:30.680 --> 3:06:35.080]  and they're new to the game and so they haven't learned all the tricks of the trade which they'll
[3:06:35.080 --> 3:06:38.760]  soon learn well with even with q and linwood it's like the same thing it's like you kind of just
[3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:43.320]  remain neutral and just tell people the truth but like when linwood is talking about john roberts
[3:06:43.320 --> 3:06:48.840]  being on the epstein logs that's a fact yeah i mean that's just a fact but it's like is is linwood
[3:06:48.840 --> 3:06:53.720]  like a q now or it's like oh he's good he's good and then he tells you some bad news many me many
[3:06:53.720 --> 3:06:59.320]  people have a microphone over here this is like a system it's like in the rnc four years ago
[3:06:59.320 --> 3:07:06.280]  new system this is old school talk radio i like this let me display some to you
[3:07:08.440 --> 3:07:11.720]  my thing with the q people is they always take stuff we've already documented it's already well
[3:07:11.720 --> 3:07:17.240]  known which is true which is great then they add a little bs to the top of it like i mean imagine
[3:07:17.240 --> 3:07:23.800]  it would be big news if i came on and said secret forces have arrested uh lin cheney and obama
[3:07:23.800 --> 3:07:29.400]  and biden and biden died of an aneurysm on the way to the fema camp they that would be 10 million
[3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:34.520]  views but not before a shootout but it's not it's not a shootout at the server farm it's not true
[3:07:35.400 --> 3:07:38.920]  i mean like we make little mistakes to make huge deals out of it but usually we're right
[3:07:38.920 --> 3:07:43.640]  like 98 percent of the time so that's all i'm saying is trump surrounded i had to pay for the
[3:07:43.640 --> 3:07:48.600]  day of march it's not like i'm important dude that shows how much trouble we're in but that is also
[3:07:48.600 --> 3:07:55.240]  what he's saying is like trump again instead of ingratiating himself with the people that the
[3:07:55.240 --> 3:08:00.200]  republican party hates but that got trump into office he instead ingratiated himself into the
[3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:04.440]  republican party that planned on stabbing him in the back the whole time he should have always
[3:08:04.440 --> 3:08:08.520]  gone with the grassroots he should have always gone with the people that had his back during the
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:14.040]  during the nomination process they were running the defense they did four years of the prevent
[3:08:14.040 --> 3:08:18.920]  defense the whole time it was just keep him keep him on his heels keep him screwed up with all
[3:08:18.920 --> 3:08:22.680]  these investigations tell him we'll help him tell him we're gonna help him and pretend like it but
[3:08:22.680 --> 3:08:27.640]  we're not really serious and and hey the good thing the only good thing about this is that we've
[3:08:27.640 --> 3:08:31.960]  learned who the turncoats on the republican party even ran paul was like i'm ashamed of what
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:36.280]  happened here yesterday well you know what buddy you might not even know the full story you know

[3:12:05.320 --> 3:12:13.640]  we're back here live oh enjoyer here fourth hour the alex jones show we're mobilizing alex jones
[3:12:13.640 --> 3:12:20.120]  of the capital right now and you know just another example of the complete control of this
[3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:27.240]  occupation and and takeover of america i mean it's so right in front of your face
[3:12:27.240 --> 3:12:35.160]  they use the fake pandemic to essentially shut down any organic street activity and then give them
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:41.080]  the excuse to barricade themselves into their criminal holdouts in the supreme court in the
[3:12:41.080 --> 3:12:46.200]  capital building and so that's what we're dealing with here and now they're able to use the police
[3:12:46.200 --> 3:12:51.160]  force like some sort of foreign military to stop we the people from taking our country back and
[3:12:51.160 --> 3:12:56.040]  look a lot of police are awake a lot of people in the in the force listen some people are
[3:12:56.040 --> 3:12:59.320]  listening some people i think you're finding out now i mean they just want to smash somebody's head
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:05.320]  in i think we saw that yesterday in dc perhaps the dc police force is worst about that um but
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:11.880]  the point is we can't even get access to the criminals and then anybody who wants to call
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:17.000]  out the criminal activity gets shut down on the internet so it's a full on attack against our
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:21.880]  first amendment on on every different angle the right to free speech the right to redress
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:27.880]  grievances with the government and the right to peacefully assemble so it's it's it's just it's
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:33.880]  so advanced in its planning it's going to be a hard thing to defeat but america existing is a
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:41.880]  miracle the founding fathers with the patriots in the 1776 revolution defeated against all odds
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:46.920]  the the greatest empire the earth had ever known they said the sun never sat on the british empire
[3:13:46.920 --> 3:13:52.280]  the fights out of the open now so against all odds we defeated it then so we're against all odds now
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:57.400]  we're dealing with the biggest global empire since perhaps the british empire and if we
[3:13:57.400 --> 3:14:04.120]  can do this again at 1776 worldwide in the year 2021 we've got brian calling in from new hampshire
[3:14:04.120 --> 3:14:11.240]  he's on the alex joneshow go ahead brian how's it going on good thank you and i just wanted to
[3:14:11.240 --> 3:14:16.040]  say real quick uh the events that happened in washington i wasn't there unfortunately but i
[3:14:16.040 --> 3:14:21.880]  want to say i'm proud of the pictures i showed up i understand it was uh most likely taken over by
[3:14:22.920 --> 3:14:27.720]  provocateurs but at the end of the day we also have to look at what these people have done to us
[3:14:27.720 --> 3:14:34.280]  okay when is it time for us to fight back it may turn physical uh at some point it might but but
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:38.440]  look what they've done to us recently we've been on lockdown for an entire year we're there they're
[3:14:38.440 --> 3:14:44.680]  threatening us with um these these alien shots that they're trying to put in people they've been
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:48.840]  murdering us in the streets they've been burning down our businesses burning our homes hurting our
[3:14:48.840 --> 3:14:54.600]  loved ones i mean you can't blame people for what happened so yeah they shut down our free market
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:14:59.480]  and that's why we have to have the intellectual debate here's the problem we've all already had
[3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:03.560]  the intellectual debate in our minds that are that are even more powerful than the most super
[3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:09.560]  quantum computer on earth but if we actually sit down and discuss it then we can actually have a
[3:15:09.560 --> 3:15:13.960]  measured response to this because you can sit here and debate all day long just like you said
[3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:18.360]  what is the proper response to them stealing our elections what is the proper response to them
[3:15:18.360 --> 3:15:22.600]  ending the free market what is the proper response to them totally oppressing the people i mean you
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:28.280]  can lay out all the issues and say what is the proper response again most of anybody who's thinking
[3:15:28.280 --> 3:15:33.080]  on these issues your brain is a the best super computer quantum computer you can have it's already
[3:15:33.080 --> 3:15:37.480]  gone down the road it already has the foresight it already hasn't all laid out but it's a matter of
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:44.120]  having the intellectual debate and then saying yes here's what they've done and now as a collective
[3:15:44.120 --> 3:15:48.760]  whether it's left right anybody as a collective we as a free people in the united states of america
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:55.160]  decide hey what is the appropriate response to this but you know you know the congressmen are
[3:15:55.160 --> 3:16:01.240]  scared to death and mitch mcconnell that that oh i'm gonna try to behave myself here but man
[3:16:01.240 --> 3:16:06.920]  what a dirtbag lowlife little girl i mean just oh i don't even want to insult little girls it's
[3:16:06.920 --> 3:16:11.640]  just like what i mean just what a tiny man what a tiny tiny little man what a tiny little person
[3:16:11.640 --> 3:16:17.400]  mitch mcconnell is to cave like he did but that's the point they don't represent us anymore and then
[3:16:17.400 --> 3:16:22.760]  for mitch mcconnell to come out and double and triple down oh trumps bad he lost the election now
[3:16:22.760 --> 3:16:27.720]  look at the trump supporters riding they're bad no mitch mcconnell you're bad you're the reason
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:33.160]  why we're so upset you're not going to pull the wool over our eyes you fraud you collared anything
[3:16:33.160 --> 3:16:38.040]  else brian yeah just add one more thing for you know for the people that are on the fence about
[3:16:38.040 --> 3:16:41.800]  because i'm i'm guaranteeing you some of these people that showed up they're they're great patriots
[3:16:41.800 --> 3:16:46.040]  but now they're being demonized and it scares some people and it turns them away but i just
[3:16:46.040 --> 3:16:50.200]  want to say to those people that might be feeling that way you should never feel that way you're
[3:16:50.200 --> 3:16:54.600]  standing up for your country you're in the right side of history and you can't let these people
[3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:58.280]  walk all over you when are we going to turn around when are we going to stop letting people
[3:16:58.280 --> 3:17:04.840]  roll on us as the patriots for too long we've kept our mouths shut we've been nice and and and you
[3:17:04.840 --> 3:17:11.240]  know not hostile towards any of this stuff and it's never stopped so quick taking the demonization
[3:17:11.240 --> 3:17:16.920]  so hard because they're our enemy that is exactly one that's the other thing too single time yeah and
[3:17:16.920 --> 3:17:21.000]  that's the other thing too a lot of these people specifically the veterans they've already had the
[3:17:21.000 --> 3:17:24.440]  intellectual thoughts they've already been had the debates within their own ranks of veterans
[3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:29.480]  and other and other groups and such and so they already know they're justified in in the actions
[3:17:29.480 --> 3:17:33.560]  that they're taking whether that's peacefully assembling outside of the capital whether that's
[3:17:33.560 --> 3:17:37.640]  telling the capital police and congress look this is our building you've stolen all our elections
[3:17:37.640 --> 3:17:43.480]  they're literally stealing our elections in there right now i mean you know i i don't want to make
[3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:47.720]  these graphic or harsh realities but i mean seriously if you're standing outside of your house
[3:17:48.440 --> 3:17:52.840]  and there's and your wife is in there getting getting you know raped or something by thieves
[3:17:52.840 --> 3:17:57.000]  by robbers and there's a couple goons outside you know not letting in you're gonna fight through
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:02.040]  and you're gonna try to save your wife i mean it's it's it's it may be a harsh graphic um
[3:18:02.040 --> 3:18:06.440]  you know analogy there but that's the thing it's like hey they're in there stealing our election
[3:18:06.440 --> 3:18:10.760]  right now they're in there stealing our republic right now and you're asking us to just sit out
[3:18:10.760 --> 3:18:15.560]  here and take it and a lot of people have already made the justification in their heads no this is
[3:18:15.560 --> 3:18:20.600]  how we're going to behave uh so again trump was never a violent revolutionary i don't believe he's
[3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:25.080]  ever going to call for violence as a part of trying to take our country back and either will we
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:30.200]  but the intellectual debate needs to be had what is the appropriate response to all these things
[3:18:30.200 --> 3:18:36.360]  that we've just laid out and then and then how are we going to measure and strategize to effectively
[3:18:36.360 --> 3:18:42.120]  execute so that we can take america back have a free country again have a free market again and not
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:47.640]  have a bloody civil war uh that will tear us apart and and and allow a foreign occupancy to
[3:18:47.640 --> 3:18:51.480]  potentially come in i'm not saying that would happen but but of course china wants to see us
[3:18:51.480 --> 3:18:56.280]  divided of course iran wants to see us divided of course they want to see us fighting each other
[3:18:56.280 --> 3:19:01.640]  so they could come bop us up in the end with the un uh anything else brad yeah just one last thing
[3:19:02.200 --> 3:19:07.560]  i just wanted everyone to remember too uh the one of the last callers he was saying you know
[3:19:07.560 --> 3:19:12.280]  we need to have people out there monitoring the violence um don't forget your uh what outlines
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:16.280]  in your second amendment that you can uh we need to be start bringing these well regulated
[3:19:16.280 --> 3:19:21.320]  it malicious we need them they're important so those of us that have fought for our country
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:26.200]  not saying we're above anyone else but we have the leadership skill to form these militias
[3:19:26.760 --> 3:19:33.800]  to give the training to the militarize our civil sorry our uh you know our other patriots it
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:37.640]  doesn't have to be crazy but that's your that's your well-formed group so next time something
[3:19:37.640 --> 3:19:41.960]  comes crazy down the line and we need to protect people and do all this in the front line we need
[3:19:41.960 --> 3:19:46.280]  our well-regulated militias we need well and that's actually there that's actually something they
[3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:52.200]  fear the most that's why Schaefer Cox is still in jail uh if you haven't heard of Schaefer Cox
[3:19:52.200 --> 3:19:55.240]  there's probably reason they don't want to give him any attention but but it's a similar story
[3:19:55.240 --> 3:20:01.240]  they know that that's all right and quite frankly they know that there's so many military there's
[3:20:01.240 --> 3:20:05.960]  so many veterans that are in this deal that know what's going on that went overseas and fought in
[3:20:05.960 --> 3:20:09.880]  wars and put their lives on the line and saw their brothers and sisters die and bleed out right in
[3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:13.400]  front of their eyes and they're seeing what's happening in america and they're like this is
[3:20:13.400 --> 3:20:19.160]  worse than some of the countries that we had to go into uh so it's it's really an incredible time
[3:20:19.160 --> 3:20:26.120]  to be living in america and the dream the hope of self-government of independence of liberty of a
[3:20:26.120 --> 3:20:31.640]  free market it's all hanging in the balance right now brian thank you so much for the call all right
[3:20:31.640 --> 3:20:36.520]  when we come back we're trying to get alex dialed up from the capital and of course more of your
[3:20:36.520 --> 3:20:40.600]  phone calls this is the alex joneshow owensroyer sitting in here on the fourth hour we'll be right
[3:20:40.600 --> 3:20:49.640]  back anybody listening to my voice you can simply search into the term davos group technocracy
[3:20:49.640 --> 3:20:58.200]  we're technocrats you will get claus schwaab and john codd yunker and all the new world order globalist

[3:24:18.680 --> 3:24:26.280]  to six p.m. central four to seven here local time dc and i want to address a statement
[3:24:26.280 --> 3:24:35.720]  that was just made by joe biden and i don't do this to sound redundant but it's an exercise of
[3:24:35.720 --> 3:24:44.680]  speaking the truth and it's just an example of the diabolical evil of people like joe biden that
[3:24:44.680 --> 3:24:50.440]  we're dealing with joe biden just released this statement what we witnessed yesterday was not
[3:24:50.440 --> 3:24:56.680]  dissent it was disorder but again they're the ones that steal our elections they're the ones that
[3:24:56.680 --> 3:25:06.840]  flood the elections totally out of control totally unconstitutional that's disorder they're the ones
[3:25:06.840 --> 3:25:13.880]  that promote and fund and tell antifa and blm to go out and riot and destroy property and loot
[3:25:13.880 --> 3:25:20.120]  businesses and kill people but that's all good he then says they weren't protesters they were
[3:25:20.120 --> 3:25:27.080]  terrorists now again i mean this is the most clear projection you've ever seen in your life this is
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:32.840]  the most reverse reality thing you've ever seen in their life now i'll admit you could you could
[3:25:32.840 --> 3:25:37.000]  you could classify some of yesterday's activities as a riot and there's definitely going to be a
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:41.720]  couple thousand dollars worth of property damage that was done to the capital i'm not i'm not hiding
[3:25:41.720 --> 3:25:50.360]  the truth but again they go out and and and how many cities do two billion dollars worth of property
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:57.960]  damage and then they sit on mainstream news as cities burn to the ground behind them and they
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:26:03.800]  say it's a peaceful protest they sit there on the streets with the footage of people breaking glass at
[3:26:03.800 --> 3:26:09.080]  businesses running into the business looting everything and then leaving and they say oh that's
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:16.040]  why that's just a protest so it's just incredible again it just shows you they have no rules it's
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:21.080]  a total double standard you the american patriot you the conservative you the trump supporter
[3:26:21.080 --> 3:26:26.600]  you get nothing you're a slave you're a piece of crap you don't have any rights you're just
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:31.640]  assumed to be a bad person even though you're a good person and if you're a lowlife filth
[3:26:31.640 --> 3:26:36.200]  that loots and burn businesses oh you're just exalted as the hero the righteous cause he then
[3:26:36.200 --> 3:26:41.800]  says i wish we could say we couldn't see it coming but that isn't true we could no of course you
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:47.000]  could you knew you were gonna steal the election you knew you were gonna hype up violence with
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:55.960]  police killings but we knew and this is the biggest problem and i'm not blaming trump for this i mean
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:27:01.320]  he's put out his team with all the intel of the election theft but we knew the steal of the election
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:04.920]  was coming and that's what's so frustrating so for them to say oh we saw this violence coming well
[3:27:04.920 --> 3:27:10.360]  yeah you you promoted it you you caused it but for us to say oh we saw the election theft coming
[3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:13.480]  because of course you were going to steal the election you've been stealing elections in this
[3:27:13.480 --> 3:27:18.680]  country forever whether it's for republicans or democrats all of our elections are rigged
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:23.640]  info wars have been reporting on that more than anybody else so now it's here now it's actually
[3:27:23.640 --> 3:27:28.920]  happening now we're in the throes of it and they just say oh no oh it's the violence we couldn't see
[3:27:28.920 --> 3:27:33.400]  coming oh there was no election theft who would have thought people would be upset when we steal
[3:27:33.400 --> 3:27:36.920]  their election who would have thought people would be upset when we lock them in their homes and shut
[3:27:36.920 --> 3:27:41.640]  down their businesses and tell them they're not free i mean who would have seen this coming oh it's
[3:27:41.640 --> 3:27:47.560]  like it's like if you go up to the biggest guy at the bar who looks like he bench presses 400 pounds
[3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:52.280]  and eats you know 20 pounds of steak every day and your little twig needle dick like adam schiff
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:57.480]  and he goes he's like i'm gonna fight you you're not that tough and then he punches you once in
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:02.200]  the mouth you go flying through the through the doors outside oh my gosh i didn't see how who
[3:28:02.200 --> 3:28:05.800]  would have thought this big brood would have beat me up i'm a little pencil neck adam schiff oh my
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:11.960]  gosh it's crazy but again it just shows the diabolical the diabolical demon that joe biden is
[3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:16.120]  and of course exhibits the double standard all right we're going to go to emit now in seattle
[3:28:16.120 --> 3:28:23.080]  emit you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hey on first time caller long time listener since 2006
[3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:29.000]  um just want to speak to this difference between the info warriors and the q people and i think
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:34.920]  that that primary difference is uh the info warriors take personal responsibility for what
[3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:39.800]  they're going to do and what's happening to them and they don't wait around and let some mystical
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:46.280]  force take responsibility for their life but um i'm reminded of that scene in b for vendetta where
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:51.720]  after the talk show host comedian kind of gets away with his political stunt they show him being
[3:28:51.720 --> 3:29:00.520]  arrested in um and in his basement he's got a whole stash of uh just antiquities and um books
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:07.560]  and things from uh the canon of western culture and so i just want to extol to the info warriors
[3:29:07.560 --> 3:29:11.640]  out there that we need to take matters into our own hands if you think you're going to get online
[3:29:11.640 --> 3:29:18.360]  and go to infowars.com or uh band dot video or youtube and find a video to share with a friend
[3:29:18.360 --> 3:29:24.600]  um no you're not the the iron curtain is falling you you need to save what you find you need to
[3:29:24.600 --> 3:29:29.880]  save every article you read yeah no that's it just like you would store food or water for an
[3:29:29.880 --> 3:29:35.560]  emergency we have to archive and store this information this data so that in the future
[3:29:35.560 --> 3:29:40.840]  people can see it and know the history because you know that's a beauty of of the 21st century
[3:29:40.840 --> 3:29:47.240]  technology it has its downfalls uh pitfalls it has its advantages we don't have this archival
[3:29:47.240 --> 3:29:52.200]  ability uh in from the past that we have now that's why you have bill gates and all these people
[3:29:52.200 --> 3:29:58.200]  that pay like millions of dollars for Leonardo da Vinci's books millions of dollars they steal
[3:29:58.200 --> 3:30:03.160]  tesla's books they hide this stuff in the smithsonian they hide this stuff in the vatican it's all
[3:30:03.160 --> 3:30:07.640]  well documented by the way but that's why they do it is because we didn't have that ability
[3:30:07.640 --> 3:30:12.200]  of course the chinese could do it uh you know uh but people that have been around forever
[3:30:13.240 --> 3:30:16.360]  can can do this they've been around further they can archive this stuff in writings where
[3:30:16.360 --> 3:30:22.840]  there was one copy of a book from 3 000 years ago or say the bible but then they buy it and then
[3:30:22.840 --> 3:30:27.080]  they never let it out again so it's like imagine if somebody wrote the bible and found it and then
[3:30:27.080 --> 3:30:31.320]  made sure nobody else got it that's what they've been doing for human history for so long now
[3:30:31.320 --> 3:30:37.960]  we can't let them do that again that's a great point in it um we we used to talk about crowdsourced
[3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:42.360]  the truth we need to crowdsource the proof and distribute the proof they can arrest the leaders
[3:30:42.360 --> 3:30:47.160]  that have all this proof of the voter fraud and the covid fraud and the doctors and the people
[3:30:47.160 --> 3:30:52.040]  that are saving it the we that we've been abrogating our responsibility to and we think we can just go
[3:30:52.040 --> 3:30:57.800]  read about it no we have to save it and multiple hard drives in multiple locations and preserve
[3:30:57.800 --> 3:31:01.240]  the truth and take matters into our own hands because they can arrest the leaders but they
[3:31:01.240 --> 3:31:09.720]  cannot arrest us all thank you next call well excellent call there emit and um you're absolutely
[3:31:09.720 --> 3:31:17.320]  right the problem is the proof is in the pudding i mean this is again it's just it's so it's so evil
[3:31:17.320 --> 3:31:24.760]  man who do you i mean how do you actually break down and go after the people that faked the pandemic
[3:31:24.760 --> 3:31:28.760]  i mean you can look at the people in the cdc you can look at the people that go on tv but i mean
[3:31:28.760 --> 3:31:34.920]  it's already done we have the death count we have the death rate there was no pandemic we knew what
[3:31:34.920 --> 3:31:39.960]  they did to inflate the covid numbers we know how there's now no more flu no more no more pneumonia
[3:31:39.960 --> 3:31:45.400]  we know how the masks were used to spread the disease we know how qualmo and whitmer sent
[3:31:45.400 --> 3:31:51.720]  the disease elderly into the nursing homes to get about 10 000 20 000 30 000's death out of that too
[3:31:51.720 --> 3:31:57.480]  adding to the numbers totally diabolical totally evil where is again where is the will of anybody
[3:31:57.480 --> 3:32:03.480]  to do something about this i mean this is out of control it is out of control and it's stunning to
[3:32:03.480 --> 3:32:09.480]  think it's like wow does everybody really want us to just become slaves to just live in tyranny
[3:32:09.480 --> 3:32:16.360]  in some authoritarian regime with fake pandemics and fake elections is it are people that propagandize
[3:32:16.360 --> 3:32:22.120]  all right uh who is the next caller guys let's squeeze them in jared in ohio jared you're on
[3:32:22.120 --> 3:32:27.960]  the alex joneshow go ahead how you doing my voice is kind of going out there only can you hear me
[3:32:27.960 --> 3:32:34.120]  i can relate can relate jared but good yep you're good brother yeah so look i'm gonna try to be brief
[3:32:34.120 --> 3:32:40.200]  i'm i'm i was one of the first people there in the capital and you're you guys i'm gonna corroborate
[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:45.320]  this story that i've heard several times a day the majority of the people there were peaceful and
[3:32:45.320 --> 3:32:51.240]  we're trying to make a point and there were elements of in tifa there was one gentleman in particular
[3:32:51.240 --> 3:32:56.200]  he was breaking a window i go up and i confront him and everything he was saying like oh you
[3:32:56.200 --> 3:33:01.960]  damn christians everything he was saying was just pulled right from the pages of their little playbook
[3:33:01.960 --> 3:33:08.040]  so that's absolutely true i don't think anybody in there uh who was a true trump supporter in fact
[3:33:08.040 --> 3:33:13.000]  they were shouting down a lot of the a lot of these um a lot of these antifa supporters
[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:17.160]  one of the gentlemen of my group was protecting one of the cops who got thrown in the crowd
[3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:23.720]  and the uh one of the antifa members seemed to be beating on him so all right well tell you
[3:33:23.720 --> 3:33:27.880]  what hold it just just stay right there for me just stay right there on the line for me we'll
[3:33:27.880 --> 3:33:31.320]  finish your eyewitness account which i can corroborate not only with the eyewitnesses
[3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:35.400]  we've heard from but other eyewitnesses i've heard from and we haven't talked about that last
[3:33:35.400 --> 3:33:38.840]  thing you said i also have another eyewitness about what happened to the cops so we'll be right
[3:33:38.840 --> 3:33:47.080]  back with that mountain patriot in colorado thank you for holding how you doing alex man i'm just
[3:33:47.080 --> 3:33:51.720]  working as hard as i can we're in such a critical time brother how are you i love you man i want to
[3:33:51.720 --> 3:33:57.560]  make a quick plug that dna force i love it i've been using it quite a while and i just went
[3:33:57.560 --> 3:34:01.640]  looked at the ingredients again the other day and i see that it contains corsetins
[3:34:02.440 --> 3:34:10.040]  which according to some published studies that dr mercola has cited is an ionophore similar to
[3:34:10.040 --> 3:34:16.120]  hydroxychloroquine and it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look
[3:34:16.120 --> 3:34:23.480]  at that all i know is with dna force we went out and looked at these high-end products that they
[3:34:23.480 --> 3:34:27.720]  sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:31.480]  because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks and so
[3:34:31.480 --> 3:34:36.360]  we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks
[3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:47.960]  thanks for the plug the word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden
[3:34:49.240 --> 3:34:57.560]  and now that all the lies are being revealed what will you do we know that millions will do

[3:37:39.720 --> 3:37:52.040]  dot video the resistance dot video you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:37:52.040 --> 3:38:05.800]  the alex jones show live from washington dc here
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:11.320]  oh and shroy are sitting in for alex we're holding over an eyewitness to the activity
[3:38:11.320 --> 3:38:16.440]  yesterday uh jared uh jared i want you to uh restate some of your points here and finish
[3:38:16.440 --> 3:38:20.200]  your points and then uh let me just echo what you're saying with other eyewitness accounts
[3:38:20.200 --> 3:38:27.080]  that i have also heard but you were one of the first in there yesterday you saw what happened
[3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:31.640]  i think i think now that we're kind of almost 24 hours removed from this and we've seen all the
[3:38:31.640 --> 3:38:37.400]  the tiny minute finite details we're kind of all in agreement there definitely was antifa
[3:38:38.600 --> 3:38:43.080]  inside there causing this kind of that led to the avalanche so it's like the guy
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:48.680]  wants to start an avalanche so he goes and screams or you know starts it and then it falls down and
[3:38:48.680 --> 3:38:54.360]  and and you know puts a whole town under snow so jared tell us again your eyewitness account
[3:38:55.160 --> 3:38:58.840]  and then i'll kind of corroborate that with with other eyewitness accounts i've heard
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:05.720]  yeah absolutely oh and then that's a great analogy um yeah well i personally witnessed and again
[3:39:06.440 --> 3:39:13.400]  i know currently right now the thought is that is that antifa let this thing off i i'm not sure
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:19.960]  if uh entirely correct however they certainly were the violent element um once we got it at
[3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:25.160]  least at least from my they were the conductor trump supporters are pissed trump supporters
[3:39:25.160 --> 3:39:31.880]  want to save the republic but antifa was the conductor that that was the the connection
[3:39:31.880 --> 3:39:36.920]  there between the trump supporters not getting violent but being pissed and then antifa was
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:42.040]  the conductor that connected that charge got violence that then led to the trump supporters
[3:39:42.040 --> 3:39:45.800]  just going into the capital i don't even think the trump supporters got violent in fact get into
[3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:51.400]  the part about the police and i've heard this too from other eyewitnesses where police got isolated
[3:39:51.960 --> 3:39:57.320]  inside the capital multiple police isolated and there were people in there basically saying you
[3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:01.640]  know let's do the worst to these people i don't want to say but i mean folks they had police
[3:40:01.640 --> 3:40:05.400]  isolated that were like crapping their pants scared of what people were saying and if it wasn't for
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:09.800]  the trump supporters like jared here stopping them the police could have been seriously injured
[3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:16.760]  oh yeah oh i know you're absolutely right so um my particular uh my particular story happened
[3:40:16.760 --> 3:40:20.920]  when we got a bar there's like that elevator there's like another pavilion that was a bar
[3:40:20.920 --> 3:40:27.800]  on the next level where the uh the scaffolding ended and um uh individuals are trying to make
[3:40:27.800 --> 3:40:33.480]  entrance to the the narrow corridor there and so while they're trying to do that somehow one of
[3:40:33.480 --> 3:40:39.720]  the police was drug out it was in the main crowd and was getting beaten on and i i was up a little
[3:40:39.720 --> 3:40:46.280]  higher and uh one of the guys in my group he's a he's a big boy he's uh he's Ohio born and raised
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:52.600]  so they grow big right and he goes down there and and the officer was sobbing uh you see you're
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:57.640]  absolutely right and he grabbed a bodily and took him back and a lot of other trump supporters
[3:40:57.640 --> 3:41:02.040]  were also trying to aid in that but there was there was at least i'd stayed just off the top
[3:41:02.040 --> 3:41:07.880]  of my head at least eight individuals um and once in one case they were beating on a
[3:41:07.880 --> 3:41:13.240]  handicapped accessible elevator and denting it and i'm bullhorring it everyone's saying boo
[3:41:13.240 --> 3:41:19.240]  it was very clear uh just based on the tactics that were being used where you were at like yeah
[3:41:19.240 --> 3:41:23.240]  and you know what let's actually let's actually be clear about this too because you know we don't
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:28.200]  want to i mean i i don't want to be part of the divide of america i mean i'm gonna tell it like
[3:41:28.200 --> 3:41:33.640]  it is that's just that's just you know my burden but i'm not trying to i'm not trying to divide
[3:41:33.640 --> 3:41:39.240]  america let's let's be honest about the situation here there are bad actors that get inside of
[3:41:39.240 --> 3:41:45.480]  every movement whether it's blm or antifa or or trump supporters whatever these people don't
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:50.920]  have any ideology they see a group they see a group of people they see the opportunity to
[3:41:50.920 --> 3:41:55.640]  commit a crime they see the opportunity to hurt someone they see the opportunity to break something
[3:41:55.640 --> 3:42:00.680]  and so they just get into the crowds intermingle blend in like a chameleon just so they can get
[3:42:00.680 --> 3:42:05.880]  their rocks off by destroying property maiming a police officer whatever they don't have any
[3:42:05.880 --> 3:42:12.280]  ideology uh and so those are the types of people that were inside of the event yesterday when you
[3:42:12.280 --> 3:42:16.360]  talk about the tactics yeah it's the same tactic you see because they infiltrate all of these groups
[3:42:16.360 --> 3:42:21.160]  and and and to be honest except for maybe antifa i mean even inside these black lives matter ranks
[3:42:21.160 --> 3:42:25.560]  i mean you'll see it they'll be marching down the streets for whatever and they'll see people
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:29.800]  getting violent breaking into stores and you'll see people say hey don't do this you're hurting our
[3:42:29.800 --> 3:42:34.520]  movement so these people infiltrate and get into every single thing the only thing that seems to
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:42.280]  embrace it is antifa but you know let's also be fair just as justified as we are in being upset
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:47.800]  at the stolen election that happened in 2020 and just as perhaps justified as we may be to say hey
[3:42:47.800 --> 3:42:51.320]  we're gonna surround the capital we're gonna create an autonomous zone doesn't mean we want
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:56.360]  anybody hurt or any property damage but hey this is our free speech this is our first amendment
[3:42:56.360 --> 3:43:01.720]  whether we agree or not with black lives matter and and you can disagree with them all day long
[3:43:01.720 --> 3:43:05.240]  and that's fair and you can look at their mission statement and that's fair whether we disagree with
[3:43:05.240 --> 3:43:11.080]  them or not they believe they're justified they believe just like we believe or know
[3:43:11.080 --> 3:43:16.920]  that we're justified in our righteous indignation they believe and know the same way in their own
[3:43:16.920 --> 3:43:23.640]  mind so it's a very delicate thing and of course you know again you can debate whether they're
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:27.080]  right or wrong i'm not saying they're right or wrong i'm just saying that's what they believe
[3:43:27.080 --> 3:43:33.000]  so it's this new thing where i believe americans need to come together from all sides of the angle
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:38.200]  and say look we are being pit against one another we don't get along on everything we don't see eye
[3:43:38.200 --> 3:43:43.480]  to eye on everything but we're all victims of this we're all being oppressed we're all we're all
[3:43:43.480 --> 3:43:48.840]  looking at a at a at a dangerous element call it the deep state call it the new world order call it
[3:43:48.840 --> 3:43:55.240]  global corporate government it's going to capture all of us it's not going to pick and choose what
[3:43:55.240 --> 3:43:59.480]  hat you wear it's not going to pick and choose what color your skin is or what you said yesterday on
[3:43:59.480 --> 3:44:06.200]  twitter it's coming after all of us and it's you know oddly enough a lot of trump supporters upset
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:10.760]  with the way the police have behaved in the last 24 hours i feel bad now that the police are being
[3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:15.480]  put in this situation to just become the enemy of everybody to just become the enemy of americans
[3:44:15.480 --> 3:44:19.880]  that's not what they deserve that's not what should happen but if they're going to choose to be that
[3:44:19.880 --> 3:44:26.600]  obstacle in the way of of righteous anger being executed in the right way with the first amendment
[3:44:26.600 --> 3:44:29.880]  then it's going to be a problem they could have stopped the violence from happening if they would
[3:44:29.880 --> 3:44:33.320]  have planned they could have stopped the people from destroying property if they would have handled
[3:44:33.320 --> 3:44:38.360]  it properly and quite frankly if they wouldn't have killed multiple innocent people i don't think
[3:44:38.360 --> 3:44:42.200]  you would have had the group outrage um thank you so much for the call though we're almost out of
[3:44:42.200 --> 3:44:50.440]  time here hey guys who's the last caller we can take uh chase you said okay i'm sorry yeah chase
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:56.920]  in michigan chase you're on the alex jones show go ahead hey uh oh and i've been a fan for a long
[3:44:56.920 --> 3:45:05.480]  time um i just want to ask you you know as as patriots what are we gonna do when when i when
[3:45:05.480 --> 3:45:13.080]  binding gets into office and you sworn to to tax away our firearms like a previous caller has said
[3:45:13.080 --> 3:45:18.920]  be on the front lines with the militia right uh congregate what are we gonna do when those firearms
[3:45:18.920 --> 3:45:26.520]  are taken away because we can't afford to keep them sure and they're definitely gonna do that um
[3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:32.200]  what you're gonna see is actually we were joking about this this morning um you know
[3:45:32.200 --> 3:45:36.440]  no because most of these purchases are going to be registered somewhere they you know they
[3:45:36.440 --> 3:45:40.040]  don't have a gun registry but they'll be able to trace it they probably have so let's say you've
[3:45:40.040 --> 3:45:47.160]  purchased 20 magazines so you've got 20 magazines for your rifle and let's say that somebody says
[3:45:47.160 --> 3:45:51.320]  okay well we are going to tax you you have 20 magazines well i mean people are just gonna say
[3:45:51.320 --> 3:45:56.280]  oh i lost them all my magazines broke i'm not still in occupation of these magazines so there's
[3:45:56.280 --> 3:46:01.000]  going to be little loopholes like that but answering your question overall i don't think you
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:04.760]  really can right now i'm not sure what that would look like police aren't going to go door to door
[3:46:04.760 --> 3:46:09.720]  to confiscate firearms at least i don't believe i could be wrong um many sheriff's departments
[3:46:09.720 --> 3:46:13.560]  have come out saying we're never going to do that i don't believe the military is going to do that
[3:46:13.560 --> 3:46:19.080]  so um you know the taxation is one thing there's going to be loopholes uh the registration is one
[3:46:19.080 --> 3:46:25.080]  thing so it's so i can't really answer your question because it's too open ended it's more of us
[3:46:25.080 --> 3:46:30.600]  specifically how do you respond to whatever action they're going to take to try to violate our second
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:36.840]  amendment whether that's confiscation registration taxation it just it all all depends on what the
[3:46:36.840 --> 3:46:40.680]  action they take in response to that thank you for the call chase guys who else do we have on the line
