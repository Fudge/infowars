[00:00.000 --> 00:29.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Sunday, April
[00:29.120 --> 00:34.000]  26, 2020 worldwide transmission.
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.440]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and every broadcast is important, but this one is going to be particularly
[00:39.440 --> 00:46.720]  important when I saw President Trump late last week on Thursday, look at the doctors
[00:46.720 --> 00:53.520]  in that press briefing and say to them, hey, you know, we've talked about how they can
[00:53.520 --> 00:59.480]  put light into the lungs and how it's having a great effect, you want to tell them?
[00:59.480 --> 01:02.120]  And of course, they just played dumb to make him look stupid because they all were for
[01:02.120 --> 01:03.120]  Bill Gates.
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.440]  And then he said, yeah, and there's also ways to inject things into the body that help.
[01:09.440 --> 01:13.600]  So the media spun that as he was saying, put Lysol in your body.
[01:13.600 --> 01:15.000]  No, they said that, not him.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.040]  They're trying to cause a new tide pods hysteria to blame on the president.
[01:21.040 --> 01:22.560]  And they made this his big waterloo.
[01:22.560 --> 01:23.560]  It's over.
[01:23.560 --> 01:24.560]  Trump's going to be removed.
[01:24.560 --> 01:25.560]  He's psychotic.
[01:25.560 --> 01:29.960]  Well, I went, wait a minute, I've heard of that.
[01:29.960 --> 01:34.280]  And as soon as I went and searched at the Internet Friday, I'd already found it.
[01:34.280 --> 01:38.320]  And I have sent to the president through two different sources that work for the president.
[01:38.320 --> 01:41.080]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:41.080 --> 01:43.840]  And I don't know if he's going to reverse course on canceling his briefings.
[01:43.840 --> 01:44.840]  He just says, I'm done.
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.600]  The media makes stuff up and lies and turns these into negative events.
[01:48.600 --> 01:50.000]  So I'm throwing the towel in.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  I don't think that's good.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.800]  I think he should come marching back in.
[01:55.800 --> 02:06.960]  And he should show you everything we're about to show you coming up.
[02:06.960 --> 02:11.680]  And that's going to be Senors Sinai, one of the most respected hospitals and research
[02:11.680 --> 02:13.080]  hospitals in the world.
[02:13.080 --> 02:15.520]  I mean, it's probably in the top 10 easily.
[02:15.520 --> 02:16.520]  Maybe top five.
[02:16.520 --> 02:17.880]  I mean, everybody knows Senors Sinai.
[02:17.880 --> 02:20.840]  I mean, a bum on the side of the road knows that.
[02:20.840 --> 02:25.440]  It's Los Angeles's top hospital where all the rich and famous go and the rest of us
[02:25.440 --> 02:28.760]  have the best doctors in the world in it.
[02:28.760 --> 02:35.120]  And they have got patented COVID-19 treatments that they're trying to get approved right
[02:35.120 --> 02:37.200]  now.
[02:37.200 --> 02:41.120]  And we'll go to Dr. McCann in a little while.
[02:41.120 --> 02:42.120]  You guys are good.
[02:42.120 --> 02:43.120]  We're cool.
[02:43.120 --> 02:45.120]  No need to get the stuff up right now.
[02:45.120 --> 02:46.120]  Thanks.
[02:46.120 --> 02:52.560]  That's all coming up here today, ladies and gentlemen, where you're going to see Trump
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.760]  say, I heard you could put light into the body.
[02:56.760 --> 02:57.760]  He looks at the doctors.
[02:57.760 --> 02:58.760]  You told me about that.
[02:58.760 --> 03:02.440]  And they just played dumb because that's the whole game that the president's not allowed
[03:02.440 --> 03:03.440]  to give people hope.
[03:03.440 --> 03:05.720]  He's not allowed to have briefings.
[03:05.720 --> 03:07.720]  Only Bill Gates says, he's our doctor.
[03:07.720 --> 03:08.720]  He's our daddy.
[03:08.720 --> 03:11.800]  And he's not a doctor either.
[03:11.800 --> 03:17.120]  So I'm going to go over all of that here today because it's not just defending Trump.
[03:17.120 --> 03:24.200]  It's showing how the media knowingly lies because YouTube took down Cedar Sinai's own
[03:24.200 --> 03:31.560]  video from a month ago about treating COVID-19 very successfully, lowering a light down
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.920]  the throat into the bronchi eye and into the opening of the lungs and just annihilating
[03:36.920 --> 03:39.480]  the viruses.
[03:39.480 --> 03:44.040]  And so Trump was just talking about something real, but they want to make us like troglodytes
[03:44.040 --> 03:46.320]  that are afraid of knowledge and information.
[03:46.320 --> 03:50.600]  And then he talked about injecting things into the body to kill it.
[03:50.600 --> 03:52.280]  Well, of course.
[03:52.280 --> 03:56.320]  And that's the big studies being conducted here in Austin and in Melbourne, Australia.
[03:56.320 --> 04:03.920]  I have those reports by prestigious universities and hospitals in conjunction that injecting
[04:03.920 --> 04:08.020]  zinc into the veins in a hospital setting is very successful.
[04:08.020 --> 04:13.680]  So Trump is just simply there telling you about low-cost, inexpensive things that Bill
[04:13.680 --> 04:17.840]  Gates doesn't own that aren't a vaccine that's two years away, that isn't a world
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.120]  ID that doesn't track everything you do and doesn't kill you.
[04:22.120 --> 04:23.640]  And he's not supposed to do that.
[04:23.640 --> 04:25.040]  Well, we're going to do it.
[04:25.040 --> 04:27.240]  But I'll tell you, we're in a real medical tyranny with Big Pharma.
[04:27.240 --> 04:29.280]  They're not just censoring stuff online.
[04:29.280 --> 04:33.800]  They're going around trying to get people arrested, including medical clinics that have
[04:33.800 --> 04:37.160]  been given people vitamin C treatments for a decade.
[04:37.160 --> 04:41.720]  I mean, I don't go to doctors a lot, but I've been to medical clinics with MD doctors
[04:41.720 --> 04:44.200]  with three degrees and done that vitamin C stuff.
[04:44.200 --> 04:45.200]  It's amazing.
[04:45.200 --> 04:51.920]  They have the FBI swat teaming those like crack houses in Michigan and other areas.
[04:51.920 --> 04:52.920]  So it is crazy.
[04:52.920 --> 04:59.000]  We'll break it all down straight ahead.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.520]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles
[05:03.520 --> 05:05.360]  off and then he becomes gelted.
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.560]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now.
[05:08.560 --> 05:10.200]  We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[05:10.200 --> 05:13.480]  Well, this is like North Korea and China are going into deeper tyranny as well.
[05:13.480 --> 05:15.080]  It's all directed by the UN.
[05:15.080 --> 05:21.000]  It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan to absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.560]  and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[05:23.560 --> 05:28.480]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash
[05:28.480 --> 05:30.640]  your kids the way they say and have absolutely no freedom.
[05:30.640 --> 05:32.840]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[05:32.840 --> 05:34.840]  This is a giant revolution.
[05:34.840 --> 05:37.920]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, oh, it's just an extended spring break,
[05:37.920 --> 05:38.920]  two weeks.
[05:38.920 --> 05:41.520]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years.
[05:41.520 --> 05:42.640]  It never ends.
[05:42.640 --> 05:45.120]  No one can ever die from a virus again.
[05:45.120 --> 05:46.760]  Government will save you.
[05:46.760 --> 05:48.000]  It's a takeover.
[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000]  It's the opposite.
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.160]  They're coming with forced inoculations on record.
[05:51.160 --> 05:55.640]  They'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you.
[05:55.640 --> 06:12.840]  And they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[06:12.840 --> 06:18.360]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:18.360 --> 06:26.200]  Well, the censorship with 109 days out from the election by big tech tried to throw the
[06:26.200 --> 06:29.520]  election, the election meddling has gone into overdrive.
[06:29.520 --> 06:31.360]  They've hit the afterburners.
[06:31.360 --> 06:34.360]  They've turned on the turbochargers.
[06:34.360 --> 06:40.280]  They have ignited the nitrogen oxide.
[06:40.280 --> 06:45.160]  That's a whole other subject, but it ties into what we're first about to cover here.
[06:45.160 --> 06:49.160]  That gorsi of Twitter came out and said they're going to start putting disclaimers from Snopes
[06:49.160 --> 06:52.760]  and Media Matters, the Democratic Party, over Trump's tweets.
[06:52.760 --> 06:56.960]  So the Democratic Party will be commenting in live time on his tweets, but he won't
[06:56.960 --> 06:57.960]  be able to comment.
[06:57.960 --> 07:01.200]  The Republicans won't be able to comment in live time over Democrat tweets.
[07:01.200 --> 07:05.720]  Total, complete, absolute election meddling, and I'm sure Trump will just bend over to
[07:05.720 --> 07:06.720]  that.
[07:06.720 --> 07:07.720]  That's what he does.
[07:07.720 --> 07:09.520]  That's one of his biggest failings.
[07:09.520 --> 07:19.400]  And CNN had a famous interview where the mother of one of Biden's sexual assault victims
[07:19.400 --> 07:21.800]  talked about what he'd done to her daughter.
[07:21.800 --> 07:28.120]  They've removed that Larry King live episode off the CNN archive and off of Google and
[07:28.120 --> 07:33.920]  Twitter and others are now expunging it everywhere and defending it because Joe Biden cannot
[07:33.920 --> 07:40.560]  be criticized, so this is just live time, massive criminal activity, but let's hit the
[07:40.560 --> 07:45.000]  ultra giant piece of news up front.
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.080]  If you go to infowars.com or newswars.com, we can put up the live page for the live
[07:50.080 --> 07:55.120]  feed today that I hope everybody will share because this is a participation sport.
[07:55.120 --> 08:03.560]  Live Sunday coronavirus news briefing, doctors across the US come forward to defend Trump.
[08:03.560 --> 08:09.880]  The infowars broadcast is important, but this one has so much critical key information.
[08:09.880 --> 08:14.440]  You won't find anywhere else, tune in and share this link as aggressively as you can
[08:14.440 --> 08:20.840]  because we have in that page, not just the live feed of myself, but we've posted the
[08:20.840 --> 08:27.520]  full hour long press conference of two prestigious doctors that own and run large clinics across
[08:27.520 --> 08:32.720]  California who've talked to top medical state officials and the head of the state health
[08:32.720 --> 08:37.280]  department agreed with them that the lockdown is evil and wrong.
[08:37.280 --> 08:41.520]  And they went on to say it's causing mass death already.
[08:41.520 --> 08:46.520]  That hour long press conference is absolutely something that you've got to share.
[08:46.520 --> 08:51.840]  It's like penicillin to bacteria, sunlight to viruses, it needs to be out there before
[08:51.840 --> 08:55.320]  the total depression and the martial law lockdown is complete.
[08:55.320 --> 09:00.960]  Also posted on that live feed page and usually the live feed just got me up there and then
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.280]  I'll place up on air, but I just bypass Alex Jones, just get these videos out, okay?
[09:06.280 --> 09:08.880]  They're super important.
[09:08.880 --> 09:14.440]  Cedar Sinai, the most prestigious West Coast hospital, probably the most prestigious in
[09:14.440 --> 09:20.520]  the United States after John Hopkins or maybe MD Anderson.
[09:20.520 --> 09:22.760]  I mean, it's probably the most prestigious.
[09:22.760 --> 09:27.200]  Everybody knows Cedar Sinai as a major hospital, but also a research hospital, cutting edge
[09:27.200 --> 09:28.200]  stuff.
[09:28.200 --> 09:31.240]  There's no clinics right up there, I mean, it's in the top five, we'll see in the top
[09:31.240 --> 09:32.240]  center earlier.
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.440]  It's in the top three probably, number one probably.
[09:36.440 --> 09:39.120]  It's like debating who's the greatest football team ever.
[09:39.120 --> 09:41.200]  And there's only a couple of them up there.
[09:41.200 --> 09:51.400]  They have come out and snaked different types of fiber optic light down the throat and just
[09:51.400 --> 09:55.760]  knock out viruses like it's incredible.
[09:55.760 --> 10:03.120]  What knows about this, and it's in Yahoo News and huge, huge admissions of this.
[10:03.120 --> 10:10.600]  That's what he was talking about, but his own medical advisors had told him about it
[10:10.600 --> 10:12.960]  and when he tried to talk about it, they just left him in the lurch because they're all
[10:12.960 --> 10:14.720]  financed by Bill Gates.
[10:14.720 --> 10:16.480]  They tell him about something promising.
[10:16.480 --> 10:20.560]  He gets there and they try to act like he's dumb, but it gets better.
[10:20.560 --> 10:24.760]  He also talked about how there's things you can put into your body he sees in studies
[10:24.760 --> 10:26.600]  he's been told about that knock it out.
[10:26.600 --> 10:31.040]  Well, I've got all those studies, vitamin C, zinc, it's what Europe's doing, it's what
[10:31.040 --> 10:36.760]  New York medical facilities are doing, but not so fast, the FBI's coming to arrest medical
[10:36.760 --> 10:39.360]  doctors, SWAT team, everything.
[10:39.360 --> 10:42.520]  Doesn't matter you've done it for 10 years, doesn't matter you've got a stack of studies
[10:42.520 --> 10:46.360]  this high, doesn't matter you've got three medical degrees, big farmer runs this country
[10:46.360 --> 10:50.960]  and the Democratic Party and they want fear.
[10:50.960 --> 10:55.720]  And so they send in the FBI agents in their hazmat suits because oh, it must be okay they're
[10:55.720 --> 11:01.560]  writing a medical clinic that was giving people vitamin C for a decade because well, there
[11:01.560 --> 11:02.560]  weren't hazmat suits.
[11:02.560 --> 11:08.240]  I mean, the people inside must be bad, maybe they'll line them up and shoot them or something,
[11:08.240 --> 11:12.520]  but that's what's going on here and it gets more and more insane.
[11:12.520 --> 11:18.000]  By the way, here in Austin, they're all over the town, medical facilities running where
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.800]  you can go get IVs for vitamin C, for vitamin D3, for vitamin B12, for all sorts of stuff.
[11:27.800 --> 11:35.040]  It's totally normal and the argument is oh, it can't be for COVID-19, nothing's approved
[11:35.040 --> 11:36.040]  for that.
[11:36.040 --> 11:40.400]  But you read the laws, a doctor can give anything that's seen as safe and effective, that's
[11:40.400 --> 11:46.320]  a vitamin or a mineral for whatever they want because it's already therapeutic.
[11:46.320 --> 11:50.400]  And the clinic wasn't even advertising and I looked up their site as a treatment or a
[11:50.400 --> 11:55.320]  cure that were saying you need to boost your immune system and even a medical doctor can't
[11:55.320 --> 12:00.640]  because Bill Gates, who doesn't have a single degree, is our Lord and Savior and rules over
[12:00.640 --> 12:02.640]  the entire country.
[12:02.640 --> 12:09.300]  So when we come back, I am going to air here the video from Cedar Sinai, they'll probably
[12:09.300 --> 12:14.160]  swat team them and as long as the FBI wears a hazmat suit, they'll just walk in and grab
[12:14.160 --> 12:21.240]  the machine, pull the people up, because somebody told them from the tyrannical FDA, that's
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.000]  all Bill Gates run basically, every major scientific institution has got his people
[12:25.000 --> 12:28.760]  and he revolving door paid to have them there, he said I'll give you $100 million grant,
[12:28.760 --> 12:32.200]  just put my guy in there, he was the head of that, put my gal as the head of that and
[12:32.200 --> 12:37.800]  Trump's surrounded by all these Bill and Melinda Gates people, Fauci got $100 million in October
[12:37.800 --> 12:46.240]  of last year, 6 months ago, 7 months ago, from Gates, people like who died and made
[12:46.240 --> 12:52.400]  this guy king, by the way he's under indictment in countries for his vaccines killing people
[12:52.400 --> 12:58.560]  and Robert Kennedy Jr. has come out and said Bill Gates is WHO over vaccine that killed
[12:58.560 --> 13:06.320]  more children in Africa than diseases it targeted, wow yeah, Robert F. Kennedy, slams Bill Gates
[13:06.320 --> 13:12.080]  that video is coming up, this is all coming out, you see, the scientists at the UN came
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.480]  out in December of last year and they were on record, we played the clips there probably
[13:16.480 --> 13:23.680]  20 times and they said, our own doctors won't give vaccines now, they're maiming people,
[13:23.680 --> 13:28.160]  they're killing people, they're not even tested, Bill Gates tells us what to do, it's all just
[13:28.160 --> 13:32.200]  giving us a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and itself is a big consortium of very evil
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.600]  organizations, you talk about Legion of Doom, all the big old robber bearing eugenics money
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.480]  and they control academia, it's exactly what Eisenhower warned about this farewell address
[13:42.480 --> 13:53.600]  is a technological elite controlling academia and science and so that's why if you're given
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.840]  people vitamin C SWAT teams are coming, that's why if you're giving them vitamin D SWAT teams
[13:57.840 --> 14:03.600]  are coming, it's why if you tell them, Trump had a scientist up there to explain that sunlight
[14:03.600 --> 14:08.400]  kills it in 30 seconds, COVID-19, it's a coronavirus, same damn thing, just a variety
[14:08.400 --> 14:17.320]  of that, kills it in 30 seconds, they're now calling for Trump to be basically arrested
[14:17.320 --> 14:22.520]  for that because he's explained to you that being cooped up inside inside these big apartment
[14:22.520 --> 14:26.280]  buildings is where it goes through the ventilation systems and it's where it's breeding, all
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.160]  the studies show that, so for him saying, hey you need sunshine, something every mother
[14:30.160 --> 14:34.080]  tells their child in the winter, hey it's a sunny day, get out, get some fresh air so
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.120]  you don't get sick, they've known for thousands of years whether people worship the sun, they
[14:38.120 --> 14:41.880]  didn't know it made you produce vitamin D that if you don't have it, a common cold
[14:41.880 --> 14:46.840]  can kill you, they just knew that plants grew, that people got sick during the winter, that
[14:46.840 --> 14:50.760]  when you went outside and got sun, people got healthier, but we're not allowed to have
[14:50.760 --> 14:56.200]  our own knowledge, we're supposed to just let Bill Gates, whose mother ran IBM and took
[14:56.200 --> 15:00.840]  over the foundation for Thomas Watson, the top Nazi and his father, a eugenicist, the
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.480]  head of Planned Parenthood because he wants to run our medical lives, he's God and if
[15:05.480 --> 15:16.920]  you don't do what he says SWAT teams are coming and they're talking about firing all these
[15:16.920 --> 15:23.680]  big top doctors that have gone public with their national TV shows, Dr. Phil, Dr. Oz
[15:23.680 --> 15:30.080]  and said this is a hoax because any real medical doctor now can pull back and tell you that
[15:30.080 --> 15:33.560]  it's less than one tenth of one percent of death rate and wait till we play the press
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.200]  conference of the doctors in the next hour, but the full press conference is on infowars.com
[15:38.200 --> 15:43.720]  right now, but when we come back, I'm going to show you Cedar Sinai, probably FBI SWAT
[15:43.720 --> 15:48.120]  teams on their way with battle tanks, they'll probably burn the Cedar Sinai down, I mean
[15:48.120 --> 15:53.880]  hell, drop nuclear weapons on them, how dare them confirm the president right and the video
[15:53.880 --> 15:58.920]  you're going to see is being removed everywhere.
[15:58.920 --> 16:06.240]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential,
[16:06.240 --> 16:11.640]  that's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes and controls to our family
[16:11.640 --> 16:17.040]  farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large
[16:17.040 --> 16:23.920]  corporate conglomerate, that's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is
[16:23.920 --> 16:29.640]  phased out, they can simply look at us and say, because again, you are non-essential,
[16:29.640 --> 16:34.360]  that's what the robots and all of this is about, it's about setting it up where we're
[16:34.360 --> 16:39.720]  no longer in charge of our lives, we can be told to stay on our houses, natural, shut
[16:39.720 --> 16:45.160]  up, this world doesn't belong to people anyways, it belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists
[16:45.160 --> 16:49.440]  that have merged with machines, yeah that sounds completely insane doesn't it, that's
[16:49.440 --> 16:55.320]  actually the public plan they're pushing, these people are completely psychotic and
[16:55.320 --> 16:58.400]  make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[16:58.400 --> 17:01.880]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free home
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.680]  of the brave is dying right now and everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating
[17:07.680 --> 17:11.080]  us, shutting us down and making us dependent on them.
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.680]  The food shortages have begun, the depression is going to be long and very very serious,
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.960]  in fact it's probably too late now to even turn back, Trump tried to stop it, but the
[17:19.960 --> 17:24.000]  mainstream media working with the tricombs blocked it, that's why you and myself, everybody
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.080]  else has to get prepared now, do not wait, it's not about the virus, it's about the
[17:29.080 --> 17:33.440]  economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year, get your
[17:33.440 --> 17:38.240]  high quality storeable foods and at FullWareStore.com they're available again before a limited time,
[17:38.240 --> 17:44.080]  the food supply is running out, there are major shortages, this is a globalist siege,
[17:44.080 --> 17:49.240]  a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism, but we the people, the patriots have to be
[17:49.240 --> 17:52.800]  prepared, we've already been proven right about prepping so far, we'll get ready to
[17:52.800 --> 17:58.640]  be really proven right, get your storeable foods now and at FullWareStore.com.
[17:58.640 --> 18:03.920]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight, if other human beings don't resonate with
[18:03.920 --> 18:07.520]  what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products to fund
[18:07.520 --> 18:11.880]  our operation, the dog doesn't hunt, but you get that, you are patriots, you are people
[18:11.880 --> 18:16.640]  that live and work in the real world of a race color, create and understand what's happening
[18:16.640 --> 18:19.960]  and that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick
[18:19.960 --> 18:24.400]  joke, thank you for what you've done, we're all of this together, we believe in the rights
[18:24.400 --> 18:28.120]  of the unborn, we believe in families, we believe in the right to self-defense, we believe
[18:28.120 --> 18:33.800]  in capitalism, America and Jesus Christ, number one and we believe in free speech and so the
[18:33.800 --> 18:38.680]  fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing
[18:38.680 --> 18:43.920]  does everything in the world, that's why I salute you and I thank you continually because
[18:43.920 --> 18:47.160]  the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now, they thought they'd
[18:47.160 --> 18:51.840]  be in charge, they thought they would have won, but they didn't count on you and I and
[18:51.840 --> 18:58.360]  others coming together, so God bless you all.
[18:58.360 --> 19:03.560]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion
[19:03.560 --> 19:10.320]  people, extra 500 million are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions
[19:10.320 --> 19:15.480]  already starving because of the global lockdown, that is hundreds of times worse than all the
[19:15.480 --> 19:19.840]  desert in the world caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked it up and gave
[19:19.840 --> 19:24.400]  it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization with Bill Gates involved are now the ones
[19:24.400 --> 19:29.600]  running the operation to shut down society, create a depression and forcibly inoculate
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.440]  everybody, this is insane, ladies and gentlemen if they succeed, it's over, you need to get
[19:34.440 --> 19:39.600]  prepared now, you need to get high quality, swarble food now back in stock at infowarstore.com
[19:39.600 --> 19:44.120]  and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere, big tech
[19:44.120 --> 19:48.280]  is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge
[19:48.280 --> 19:53.760]  verbally social distancing, this is beyond 1984, the tyranny of the dual orders here,
[19:53.760 --> 20:01.440]  get prepared now and spread the word in the info war, you are the Paul Revere's.
[20:01.440 --> 20:19.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, alright I'm Alex Jones your host and this information
[20:19.840 --> 20:30.560]  is the antidote to the globalist tyranny and the only way this information gets out is
[20:30.560 --> 20:40.160]  when you share the live feeds at infowars.com, newswars.com, and Bandai video, okay next
[20:40.160 --> 20:49.160]  segment I'll get into the CDC confirming what we told you 5-6 weeks ago that the chai comms
[20:49.160 --> 20:55.280]  were purposely infecting the COVID-19 tests they were shipping here to give us COVID-19,
[20:55.280 --> 21:00.080]  of course videos them wiping their shoes with the mask they sent here that Gavin Newsom
[21:00.080 --> 21:03.960]  then makes you wear, they know what they're doing, just like the British you know there's
[21:03.960 --> 21:08.080]  manuals of them in the French and Indian war they take their blankets from where troops
[21:08.080 --> 21:12.440]  died of smallpox and then with all the pus on them and give them to the natives, no one
[21:12.440 --> 21:18.520]  would kill them real quick but anyways I digress, turns out the CDC had testing kits that didn't
[21:18.520 --> 21:24.880]  come from China that infected people as well, of course these are master criminals making
[21:24.880 --> 21:30.440]  their big move on everybody and that's why they're pulling out the stops to try to destroy
[21:30.440 --> 21:34.400]  anybody that tells the truth but this is what separates the boys from the men right now
[21:34.400 --> 21:39.160]  ladies and gentlemen so that's coming up next segment, okay let's get to this now, so
[21:39.160 --> 21:44.400]  Trump on Thursday has to have a Homeland Security head scientist with a huge laboratory come
[21:44.400 --> 21:50.680]  out and explain sunlight is good for you going indoors all the time makes you sick and lowers
[21:50.680 --> 21:55.960]  your immune system, he also went by the way I've been told about treatments and he's
[21:55.960 --> 22:01.280]  pointing at the doctors, he's like we want to come forward about the light treatment
[22:01.280 --> 22:09.520]  that had been Yahoo top finance news a week before, it had been WebMD the week before
[22:09.520 --> 22:14.920]  we'd even covered it two weeks ago when Cedar Sinai said they were doing the big test successfully
[22:14.920 --> 22:19.760]  they've been going on for over a month and then I was watching the backlash Friday and
[22:19.760 --> 22:27.480]  I went wait a minute, Cedar Sinai so I looked it up turned out already YouTube and now Twitter
[22:27.480 --> 22:36.840]  are pulling the video that we've hosted at band.video gathers AP reporting on it, April
[22:36.840 --> 22:44.880]  20th, wow I said I learned about it two weeks ago but AP I just learned about it just a
[22:44.880 --> 22:52.600]  few days ago, so Trump is reporting on something that they're doing test it's working well
[22:52.600 --> 22:56.840]  Cedar Sinai he said I don't know if it's going to be perfect I just think it gives
[22:56.840 --> 23:00.960]  us hope would you like to tell him you told me about that they're like we're seeing so
[23:00.960 --> 23:06.120]  again he's bad for saying this and giving people hope they're saying he's be removed
[23:06.120 --> 23:11.320]  from office he's the worst person on earth and then he just totally made this up then
[23:11.320 --> 23:16.880]  they said he made up the next thing which was putting things into the body that also
[23:16.880 --> 23:23.000]  counter it like zinc and vitamin C I'm going to show you those studies that are incredibly
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.600]  detailed and revealing and successful but again we elected the president he can have
[23:28.600 --> 23:33.720]  press conferences the idea that he shouldn't be up there telling you about things that
[23:33.720 --> 23:38.400]  are hopeful and the way only one study out of hundreds says hydroxychloroquine doesn't
[23:38.400 --> 23:42.480]  help put out my billable in the gates because they don't want you to have hope because they
[23:42.480 --> 23:47.760]  want you to buy expensive drugs and die from them and they want to keep the economy shut
[23:47.760 --> 23:54.640]  down they want fear and now the numbers are 10 15 20 times lower they originally said
[23:54.640 --> 23:59.080]  they don't know what to do so here's here's the supposed thought crime Trump was involved
[23:59.080 --> 24:07.120]  in we hit the body with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light
[24:07.120 --> 24:12.960]  and I think you said that has him in check but you're going to test it and then I said
[24:12.960 --> 24:16.280]  supposing you brought the light inside the body you can which you can do either through
[24:16.280 --> 24:22.680]  the skin or in some other way and I think you said you're going to test that too sounds
[24:22.680 --> 24:30.520]  interesting right and then I see the disinfectant it knocks it out in a minute one minute and
[24:30.520 --> 24:39.040]  is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or or almost a cleaning
[24:39.040 --> 24:42.840]  because you see it gets on the lungs and it does a tremendous number of lungs so it'd
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.720]  be interesting to check that so that you're going to have to use medical doctors with
[24:46.720 --> 24:51.080]  but it sounds it sounds interesting to me well that was perfectly said other than he's
[24:51.080 --> 24:59.400]  calling this in fact and it's it's really a vital nutrients vitamin C vitamin D3 zinc
[24:59.400 --> 25:03.920]  and I'm going to show you the medical studies right now okay so here you go bioscience assigns
[25:03.920 --> 25:10.720]  exclusive global license with Cedar Sinai for potential coronavirus treatment April
[25:10.720 --> 25:17.720]  21st there it is right there yahoo finance news and then it goes in they're already doing
[25:17.720 --> 25:22.240]  the studies very very promising they put a video out about it that is being removed as
[25:22.240 --> 25:28.520]  fake news and harmful so because someone went oh actually the president was briefed on this
[25:28.520 --> 25:33.560]  well we can't allow that we can't let you see what Cedar Sinai said because now it's
[25:33.560 --> 25:38.200]  Alex Jones and Trump getting censored now it's Cedar Sinai one of the most prestigious
[25:38.200 --> 25:43.440]  medical facilities and hospitals in the world so without further ado YouTube censors video
[25:43.440 --> 25:48.640]  of UV light treatment use against coronavirus that's on news wars dot com again it's in the
[25:48.640 --> 25:54.880]  live feed show live Sunday show has the the full video posted here is a piece of it it's
[25:54.880 --> 26:02.920]  mainly visual so I will narrate the evil video put out by a tube bioscience and Cedar Sinai
[26:02.920 --> 26:11.560]  evil super elite medical facility can't trust them only trust Bill Gates here it is you
[26:11.560 --> 26:17.400]  did recently remove this video which shows coronavirus therapy time supposedly hit somebody
[26:17.400 --> 26:25.240]  with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light and I think you
[26:25.240 --> 26:28.880]  said that has a magic that you're gonna test it and then I said supposedly brought the
[26:28.880 --> 26:35.160]  light inside the body in which you can do either through the skin or in some other way
[26:35.160 --> 26:43.040]  and I think you said you're gonna trust that too sounds interesting video removed for violating
[26:43.040 --> 26:47.700]  YouTube's terms of service it's why it's a bad video here's the video can ultraviolet
[26:47.700 --> 26:52.200]  light be used to treat COVID-19 patients question mark this is evil Cedar Sinai will probably
[26:52.200 --> 26:58.760]  a swat team for showing us to premise it has long been known that ultraviolet or UV light
[26:58.760 --> 27:05.520]  heals viruses and bacteria but if you say that they say should be arrested the problem
[27:05.520 --> 27:13.200]  is the unfiltered UV light is dangerous to humans and human cells but filtered out the
[27:13.200 --> 27:19.800]  dangerous UVC light and leaving UV a light through become safe for human use UVA UVB
[27:19.800 --> 27:28.200]  that goes on they leave the UVA it's also been proven that the lab that the light wattage
[27:28.200 --> 27:32.320]  and duration of UV light is still effective at killing a variety of viruses bacteria including
[27:32.320 --> 27:38.400]  the coronavirus they cut the bad light out leave the good light in and very effective
[27:38.400 --> 27:45.800]  using this premise the heel light was developed by Cedar Sinai the heel light is a catheter
[27:45.800 --> 27:52.320]  embedded with small LED lights that emit UVA light in a specific way and then they show
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.520]  you so while you're on a breathing machine they give you a light it's inserted into the
[27:57.520 --> 28:05.000]  breathing tube of an intubated patient and that's what they showed Trump that's what
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.320]  they're pissed about okay the fries and viruses doesn't hurt your tissue these criminals have
[28:11.320 --> 28:16.240]  taken this down in unison and say he's a liar oh by the way I wasn't bragging about this
[28:16.240 --> 28:24.080]  I put a gym in here about a year ago where the old warehouse was and I paid for a $5,000
[28:24.080 --> 28:29.720]  night system like that for the crew it's a little room they go in it's $5,000 and they
[28:29.720 --> 28:34.080]  just get in there and it's incredible it's not for COVID-19 it's just reportedly so
[28:34.080 --> 28:37.960]  good for you and makes you feel so good boy I sure feel good when I do it I could be bummed
[28:37.960 --> 28:42.560]  out exhausted at six at night you'd work two more hours better than a cup of coffee getting
[28:42.560 --> 28:48.600]  that sucker ten minutes and I'm like whoa haha never felt better but again that's the
[28:48.600 --> 28:54.080]  type of evil terror stuff we're into always cutting edge I'm Alan Jones this is the Info
[28:54.080 --> 29:02.040]  War more straight ahead well Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that
[29:02.040 --> 29:07.680]  would cut their energy used by half and the United States wouldn't sign on to it so guess
[29:07.680 --> 29:12.760]  what happened along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates the celebrating saying it's already
[29:12.760 --> 29:17.760]  cut your carbon footprint by half and that means you're gonna be poor now and under
[29:17.760 --> 29:24.080]  his control and of course with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations a microchip
[29:24.080 --> 29:29.960]  that comes with the vaccine and so much more and Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will
[29:29.960 --> 29:35.040]  get sick and die from it so remember folks they're coming to hurt you and your family
[29:35.040 --> 29:39.640]  and destroy your basic rights the same left that says to kill babies all day long women
[29:39.640 --> 29:44.360]  own their bodies now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate
[29:44.360 --> 29:48.320]  you and if you don't submit you can't buy or sell or leave your home mark the beast
[29:48.320 --> 29:52.920]  oh and guess what Jeffery Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates
[29:52.920 --> 30:00.400]  under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face they hate you and your family what

[32:24.160 --> 32:31.680]  cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it
[32:31.680 --> 32:36.280]  in a really great way. I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face. It's got
[32:36.280 --> 32:41.480]  organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes. But I just love it personally as something
[32:41.480 --> 32:46.200]  that's a moisturizer as well. So this is the real innovation. I don't know why others didn't think
[32:46.200 --> 32:51.080]  of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you
[32:51.080 --> 32:55.600]  out. It smells great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[33:00.480 --> 33:03.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:03.440 --> 33:32.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. I hate tyranny, but I don't fight evil because I hate
[33:32.200 --> 33:38.480]  the evil. I fight evil because it's what I've got to do with my soul demands. I do it because I
[33:38.480 --> 33:44.400]  love myself, my family, and I love you. That's why these criminals sit there and try to take us
[33:44.400 --> 33:48.400]  off the air and work around the clock to shut us down with all their dirty tricks and all their
[33:48.400 --> 33:54.560]  lies is because they know people resonate with the truth and they know all their attacks have
[33:54.560 --> 34:00.760]  failed and they know that if we stay on the air, their new world order is going down. Now,
[34:00.760 --> 34:05.880]  I want to back up what I was saying with the studies here, but you just saw a video from Cedar
[34:05.880 --> 34:14.080]  Sinai about when somebody is already on a breathing machine down there in that carrier,
[34:14.080 --> 34:20.640]  the bronchial, getting in there and annihilating the viruses, which is what the damn light does.
[34:20.640 --> 34:26.440]  But see, Bill Gates is heavily invested in and owns. He doesn't give his money free. It's
[34:26.440 --> 34:32.440]  tax exempt. All these big companies and he runs the NIH. He runs everything. He's like the president,
[34:32.440 --> 34:40.720]  but unelected. And so they're really angry folks that medical doctors are everywhere saying Zink
[34:40.720 --> 34:48.960]  is good or vitamin D. But look at this. Global license with Cedar Sinai potential coronavirus
[34:48.960 --> 34:55.440]  treatment light into the lungs. YouTube censors video about UV light treatment using his
[34:55.440 --> 35:00.560]  coronavirus, but it gets more crazy. YouTube censors the video, but still the public now knows
[35:00.560 --> 35:05.440]  who did it. Mark Dice found the tweet by the New York Times reporter who reported it and had it
[35:05.440 --> 35:10.000]  removed. So when the media reports something, if they're mainstream media to Twitter, Facebook or
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.800]  YouTube, they take it down. Absolutely incredible. But let's look at this world's first trial to
[35:17.800 --> 35:25.000]  test benefit of intervening is zinc in COVID-19 fight. Austin Health and the University of Melbourne
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.720]  Department of Surgery are doing that with zinc and they're getting some promising returns. But the
[35:31.720 --> 35:36.000]  point is that's going on. That's what Trump's talking about. He's about getting things done. He's
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.880]  about solutions. Innovation of H1N1 influenza virus infection by zinc oxide nanoparticles,
[35:42.880 --> 35:49.920]  another emerging application of nanomedicine. These are studies around the world with people
[35:49.920 --> 35:55.880]  either ingesting and injecting to their veins or breathing under a medical doctor. You should
[35:55.880 --> 35:59.840]  have to preface all this. We're reading you studies. Obviously, it's medical doctors and that
[35:59.840 --> 36:07.160]  it's extremely promising. That study is from a couple of years ago. Here's another one. Effective
[36:07.160 --> 36:13.680]  zinc salts and repository virus replication. This is with pediatric patients finding just
[36:13.680 --> 36:20.080]  incredible successes with that. These are again prestigious universities. Hell, this is NIH.gov's
[36:20.080 --> 36:25.920]  where this one came from. Because the government's got a lot of good scientists in it. It's the
[36:25.920 --> 36:30.120]  people on top that are super evil and out of control. You go to the NIH website, it says,
[36:30.120 --> 36:35.480]  zinc is essential to block viruses entering the cells and to cope the cells. Without it, you die.
[36:35.480 --> 36:41.120]  It's a key for people in any time of the year to have plenty of zinc. But we say it, it's like,
[36:41.120 --> 36:49.400]  arrest Jones. Get him. He's a snake oil. CNN had said Trump is a traveling medicine show
[36:49.400 --> 36:55.520]  snake oil cells, because he talked about zinc. An aggravated Trump blames press
[36:55.520 --> 37:03.880]  for furor over disinfectant comments as his scientists defending. But let's go to this
[37:03.880 --> 37:10.400]  powerful little four minute excerpt. You'll find all of these videos, the full hour long press
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.000]  conference with top doctors in California who've talked to the top state doctors saying, you know,
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.560]  it's all a fraud. It's got to stop now. But the governor won't let him do it. They talk about
[37:19.560 --> 37:23.600]  armed rebellion at the end. And this is getting crazy. We don't want that to happen. We just
[37:23.600 --> 37:28.200]  want to turn this around. We've got the reports of the censored videos from Senator Sinai about
[37:28.200 --> 37:33.600]  the light treatment. It's all in the feed. Live Sunday coronavirus news briefing doctors across
[37:33.600 --> 37:39.120]  the US come forward to defend Trump. Here's an excerpt of it right now. We'll go to more of the
[37:39.120 --> 37:45.520]  interview next hour. But here it is. After testing thousands of people in their county for COVID-19,
[37:45.520 --> 37:52.920]  doctors Dan Erickson and Arton Massini, owners of accelerated urgent care in Bakersfield,
[37:52.920 --> 38:00.080]  California, held a press conference to share their data along with official CDC data. Dr.
[38:00.080 --> 38:05.680]  Erickson reported that hospitals in California have become empty as a result of allotting all
[38:05.680 --> 38:13.800]  resources to the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospitals, their ICUs are empty, essentially, and they're
[38:13.800 --> 38:18.680]  shutting down floors. They're furloughing patients. They're furloughing doctors because we just don't
[38:18.680 --> 38:24.800]  have the volume. So we're busy with paperwork for COVID and we're all focusing on COVID. He then
[38:24.800 --> 38:32.760]  went over the COVID-19 numbers for the state of California. We've seen 1,227 deaths in the state of
[38:32.760 --> 38:38.720]  California. That means you have a 0.03 chance of dying from COVID-19 the state of California. And
[38:38.720 --> 38:46.760]  for the state of New York, 19,410 out of 19 million people, which is a 0.1% chance of dying from
[38:46.760 --> 38:53.440]  COVID in the state of New York. And then compared these numbers to the seasonal flu in 2017, 45
[38:53.440 --> 39:01.640]  million total cases in 2017 with about 62,000 deaths or a 0.13 chance of death from flu in the
[39:01.640 --> 39:09.000]  United States. So the lethality of COVID-19 is much less. He then went on to report what is
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.280]  happening as a result of the shutdown and millions of hardworking people losing their jobs. Child
[39:15.280 --> 39:21.400]  molestation is increasing at a severe rate. We could go over multiple cases of children who have
[39:21.400 --> 39:28.280]  been molested due to angry family members who are intoxicated, who are home, who have no paycheck.
[39:28.280 --> 39:34.080]  These things last a lifetime. This isn't about a seasonal flu. These are things that will follow
[39:34.080 --> 39:39.000]  these people and affect them in a negative fashion for their life. And these are for me talking to
[39:39.000 --> 39:43.880]  ERs, talking to my doctors and talking to people across the country and finding out what they're
[39:43.880 --> 39:50.320]  seeing. Spousal abuse, alcoholism, anxiety, depression, suicide. One of the most interesting
[39:50.320 --> 39:56.400]  moments of the press conference was when Dr. Erickson went on to explain the immune complex and
[39:56.400 --> 40:02.080]  how our immune system regularly adapts to our environment. The immune system is built by exposure
[40:02.080 --> 40:07.400]  to antigens, viruses, bacteria. When you're a little child crawling on the ground, putting stuff in
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.120]  your mouth, viruses and bacteria come in. You form an antigen antel body complex. You form IgG,
[40:13.120 --> 40:17.720]  IgM. This is how your immune system is built. When you take human beings and you say, go into your
[40:17.720 --> 40:22.760]  house, clean all your counters, lie, sell them down. You're going to kill 99% of viruses and
[40:22.760 --> 40:27.920]  bacteria. Wear a mask. Don't go outside. What does that do to our immune system? Our immune system
[40:27.920 --> 40:34.800]  is used to touching. We share bacteria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus bacteria, viruses. We develop an
[40:34.800 --> 40:41.200]  immune response daily to this stuff. When you take that away from me, my immune system drops. As I
[40:41.200 --> 40:46.880]  shelter in place, my immune system drops. You keep me there for months, it drops more. Sheltering in
[40:46.880 --> 40:51.240]  place decreases your immune system. And then as we all come out of shelter in place with a lower
[40:51.240 --> 40:55.560]  immune system and start trading viruses, bacteria, what do you think is going to happen? Disease is
[40:55.560 --> 41:00.760]  going to spike. And then you've got disease spike amongst the hospital system with furloughed
[41:00.760 --> 41:05.760]  doctors and nurses. Dr. Erickson reported that he has been in contact with leading physicians
[41:05.760 --> 41:10.720]  throughout California and that they are all in agreement. And I've been working with some of the
[41:10.720 --> 41:16.640]  leaders and I've talked to, you know, the head of the CDPH. I've gotten their opinion on this and a
[41:16.640 --> 41:23.080]  lot of the leaders in Sacramento and we're all in agreement. But we need to have Governor Newsom in
[41:23.080 --> 41:29.360]  agreement with us to lift this ban because the data is showing us it's time to lift. So if we don't
[41:29.360 --> 41:35.560]  lift, what is the reason? For infowars.com, this is Greg Rees. They're going to have a big problem
[41:35.560 --> 41:39.960]  when the actual professionals that know what's going on start speaking out and they're seeing the
[41:39.960 --> 41:44.440]  truth. And they also see Trump up there talking about real stuff. They're like, yeah, Trump's
[41:44.440 --> 41:49.040]  right. And they're like, what's going on here? Why are you doing this? Because it's called a
[41:49.040 --> 41:54.360]  blockade or siege, ladies and gentlemen. And it's probably too late already. Okay. That's why
[41:54.360 --> 41:58.280]  everybody needs to get storeable food at infowars.com. Yeah, that funds us. Damn right. We need
[41:58.280 --> 42:02.320]  funding. We got the best horrible food company out there. The food is back in stock. We're ready
[42:02.320 --> 42:05.640]  to get it out to you. But you got to get your orders in now because their orders are going up so
[42:05.640 --> 42:10.120]  much that they have to pause orders and not take them again soon. So get your orders in while you
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.760]  can. And absolutely, we've got a great multi vitamin mineral with preglonone. And we've got DNA
[42:15.760 --> 42:20.880]  Force Plus. It's amazing. Real Red Pill Plus. We've got Winter Sun, vitamin D3, vitamin K that is
[42:20.880 --> 42:27.960]  essential for life in a human body. Period. That's why I take it. The globalists want you sick so
[42:27.960 --> 42:32.000]  they can control you. I want you healthy. And I sell products that are high quality, which is
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.720]  symbiotic relationship. But you don't need to buy this from me. The sun's coming out, folks. Go out,
[42:37.720 --> 42:42.800]  take your shirt off, get 30 minutes of sun a day direct sun and you're, I'm not saying you're
[42:42.800 --> 42:46.920]  bulletproof, but you're damn King Kong in it. All right. And I got myself some other day and I'm
[42:46.920 --> 42:52.720]  feeling right. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back with even more powerful intel.
[42:52.720 --> 43:00.920]  Oh, yes. And you're not supposed to get this information. When one studies history and human
[43:00.920 --> 43:06.400]  nature, you learn very quickly that rugged individualism and people to think for themselves
[43:06.400 --> 43:14.680]  build free societies, innovate to amazing things. But those that love to grovel, those that love
[43:14.680 --> 43:20.760]  to be subservient, those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue, they create stagnation,
[43:20.760 --> 43:29.560]  corruption, tyranny, and then finally collapse. And the world is now being tested. And we're
[43:29.560 --> 43:35.360]  seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing if
[43:35.360 --> 43:41.400]  they just submit down a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly future. But the
[43:41.400 --> 43:49.400]  technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic and
[43:49.400 --> 43:55.440]  are building an anti-human future. Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck
[43:55.440 --> 44:05.440]  and throwing into the ocean.
[27:38.380 --> 44:32.440]  and how much you would enjoy watching Netflix and wearing masks and gloves when
[44:32.440 --> 44:37.440]  you went out to feel all important like you were in a war. When the real time of Calvary
[44:37.440 --> 44:44.440]  was always, the billions of people at the edge of starvation, who were about dying at
[44:44.440 --> 44:51.440]  the tune of over a million people every three weeks. Calvary thanks you for what you've
[44:51.440 --> 44:58.440]  done. Continue the lockdowns while I depopulate the planet. Hail Calvary.
[45:21.440 --> 45:28.440]  And the Communist Chinese. And then our teachers and big tech has been our controllers. We're
[45:28.440 --> 45:35.440]  all being introduced now. The digital straight jacket that depends on us complying with it
[45:35.440 --> 45:41.440]  and depends on us all impecking each other into submission. But for all of you out there
[45:41.440 --> 45:46.440]  that have decided to go along with this, mark your calendars down. And then in a few months
[45:46.440 --> 45:51.440]  here's look at the world. Remember, you did this. You were the prisoners. You were the
[45:51.440 --> 45:55.440]  slaves. You were the people that crouched down and licked the hand that fed you. That's
[45:55.440 --> 46:00.440]  for me. Give me liberty or give me death. Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars can now offer
[46:00.440 --> 46:07.440]  high quality, storable food again. Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago and they told
[46:07.440 --> 46:13.440]  people they had food. Most folks never were delivered their food. Well, when our sponsors
[46:13.440 --> 46:19.440]  began to run short, they just spent sales until they opened more factories and secured
[46:19.440 --> 46:24.440]  more food. So if you eat your orders in right now, they can take new orders and get it to
[46:24.440 --> 46:30.440]  you quickly. They'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown
[46:30.440 --> 46:35.440]  of the economy is killing food distribution, farming, new name and now it's mainstream
[46:35.440 --> 46:40.440]  news. The food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen. If Trump can turn
[46:40.440 --> 46:45.440]  the economy back on and rest control of our system away from the globalist, things may
[46:45.440 --> 46:50.440]  be okay, but it looks like it's going to get very, very rough. So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[46:50.440 --> 46:54.440]  now is the time to secure the number one thing you need. High quality, storable food ready
[46:54.440 --> 47:12.440]  to get to you and your family now to get your orders in at 4store.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:25.440 --> 47:31.440]  It's hard to turn Tom Petty off, but we're going to have to do it.
[47:44.440 --> 47:49.440]  We are back live on your host Alex Jones. I've not talked about Kim Jong-un because I don't
[47:49.440 --> 47:56.440]  really care about that demonic vampire bat. I do care about his people and he probably
[47:56.440 --> 48:03.440]  has had a heart attack. He probably has had a stroke and it doesn't matter now. His even
[48:03.440 --> 48:10.440]  more competent evil sister will be in control. So it's fascinating in certain levels, but
[48:10.440 --> 48:15.440]  it doesn't matter because I can't really change what's going on in North Korea. But I can
[48:15.440 --> 48:19.440]  change what's going on here in America. And you know, back 11, 12 weeks ago, we weren't
[48:19.440 --> 48:24.440]  sure what was going on with COVID-19, but we had a good idea. And now we know exactly
[48:24.440 --> 48:31.440]  what's going on with it. We know exactly what's happened. Before I end this broadcast today,
[48:31.440 --> 48:35.440]  I will get into Kim Jong-un and what's really going on there in my view. But let me first
[48:35.440 --> 48:43.440]  just tell you about something. I was watching this press conference at about 8am this morning
[48:43.440 --> 48:48.440]  and my wife walked down the back porch and said, honey, can you just not work all the time?
[48:48.440 --> 48:54.440]  She goes, oh, what's going on with that guy? What's he saying? And well, he's a good looking doctor.
[48:54.440 --> 48:59.440]  He's well spoken and we sat there for an hour listening to him drinking coffee and she was
[48:59.440 --> 49:03.440]  like, my God, Alex, people are really waking up, honey. This is great news. I'm like, yeah.
[49:03.440 --> 49:07.440]  And then she was like watching more videos with me until like noon today. We were like
[49:07.440 --> 49:11.440]  grilling hamburgers in the back porch with an iPad out there watching more doctors. She's
[49:11.440 --> 49:15.440]  like, look at this doctor going public. Look at this doctor going public. It was in Idaho,
[49:15.440 --> 49:22.440]  in New York, in California, in Mississippi, in Texas, in Michigan, and just everywhere.
[49:22.440 --> 49:29.440]  And these two guys have a whole bunch of clinics across the state and they're well known and
[49:29.440 --> 49:40.440]  they're telling you stuff you already know is true. And so that's why I'm tempted just to
[49:40.440 --> 49:44.440]  quite frankly air this entire press conference and just leave. But then stations, people,
[49:44.440 --> 49:48.440]  you know, stations are like, what's this? Is this Alex Jones show? You sure somebody talking?
[49:48.440 --> 49:51.440]  I'm going to be here to introduce it. But you know, maybe I should just air the whole interview.
[49:51.440 --> 49:56.440]  Guys, download the whole hour long press conference because it's this stuff that will kill the
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.440]  New World Order folks. This is real medical information. It's everything you've already
[50:00.440 --> 50:03.440]  heard here. It's everything you always knew. When you were a little kid and got sick, you
[50:03.440 --> 50:08.440]  could be 70 years old, you know, mama said, go out and get some sign. And then we're told
[50:08.440 --> 50:17.440]  today, arrest people that give hope and say that. What's a damn lie?
[50:17.440 --> 50:27.440]  Let's see, Thomas Malthus, 260 years ago said, heard the poor into buildings with no
[50:27.440 --> 50:35.440]  sons so they get the vapors and die, get rid of them. And he's the father of modern eugenics.
[50:35.440 --> 50:39.440]  By the way, anybody can look at what I just said. You can search Malthus, Malthusianism.
[50:39.440 --> 50:45.440]  You'll be like, holy hell, but Jones says some crazy ass stuff. Man, I'm not the crazy person.
[50:45.440 --> 50:50.440]  I'm just telling you what these crazy ass people are up to. And let me tell you, we're all in
[50:50.440 --> 50:57.440]  danger because if you want to follow right down from Plato to Malthus to Galton to Hitler
[50:57.440 --> 51:05.440]  to Bill Gates, the apple don't fall far from the tree because it's the same tree. And by the way,
[51:05.440 --> 51:10.440]  that's the symbol of eugenics. So I've studied the real cult of the world, the real criminals,
[51:10.440 --> 51:17.440]  the real thing that runs the whole show. And you know, I am a person that likes life.
[51:17.440 --> 51:24.440]  I'm a person that does not like to be killed or put in prison or bankrupted, but I can't stop
[51:24.440 --> 51:29.440]  doing what I'm doing, even though they just keep up in the ante, up in the ante.
[51:29.440 --> 51:37.440]  I was talking to powerful DC people yesterday and today. They're like, yeah, Alex, we all admire
[51:37.440 --> 51:43.440]  what you're doing. They're going to get your ass. The only person they hate more is Trump.
[51:43.440 --> 51:48.440]  And you know, Trump's not perfect because he's not a miracle man. My God, I can't believe how much
[51:48.440 --> 51:53.440]  he's gotten done. But the fact that he's up there trying to prop up our economy and trying to give
[51:53.440 --> 51:58.440]  us hope with real information and then more Americans don't rally to his support.
[51:58.440 --> 52:04.440]  At a sick level, we don't deserve this. But you know what? My three daughters and my son too,
[52:04.440 --> 52:08.440]  genetically, you don't worry about sons. My three daughters, man, they're sweet. They're good people.
[52:08.440 --> 52:14.440]  They don't deserve to go into bondage like this. And I'm not going to sit here and lay down for this crap.
[52:14.440 --> 52:20.440]  I'll take my licks if I have to. So I've already told the LFAs and all the rest of them,
[52:20.440 --> 52:25.440]  they can piss up a row. And they just always remind me they go, we're going to hurt you real bad.
[52:25.440 --> 52:31.440]  You're your own worst enemy. You're turning the whole culture over to pure evil.
[52:31.440 --> 52:44.440]  And now YouTube and Facebook and Twitter censor Senor Sinai official studies because it backs the president up.
[52:44.440 --> 52:48.440]  There's a coup against our president, against our election and against we the people.
[52:48.440 --> 52:55.440]  And the fact is we ought to have more sense and stand up against this and say no.
[52:55.440 --> 53:01.440]  But that's the thing about leadership. You got to be there when it seems like it's the winner because it's easy to be a
[53:01.440 --> 53:09.440]  Sunshine Patriot. I am a winter soldier. And I just wish everybody realized that we were all winter soldiers.
[53:09.440 --> 53:15.440]  We've been a lot better world because it's the candy ass that thinks you're going to get ahead in life.
[53:15.440 --> 53:21.440]  I always bound down the system and that's not how it works. That's not the reality.
[53:21.440 --> 53:26.440]  Let me give you a smattering of what's coming up next hour because I do a lot of preparation for each broadcast.
[53:26.440 --> 53:33.440]  I usually cover a fraction of it. More of the press conference with those doctors and more censored stuff.
[53:33.440 --> 53:39.440]  They don't want you to see about women on Larry King live about their daughter being assaulted by Joe Biden.
[53:39.440 --> 53:45.440]  And that's been memory hold everywhere. I mean, how creepy are all these groups?
[53:45.440 --> 53:52.440]  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, parent company, all working in concert.
[53:52.440 --> 53:58.440]  CNN took it off their own website. But I got a call from a very famous talk show host.
[53:58.440 --> 54:02.440]  I mean, there's probably like three talk show hosts you can say are as big as Alex Jones.
[54:02.440 --> 54:06.440]  And I've had two of them call me the last day.
[54:06.440 --> 54:10.440]  About this saying, man, you're right. This is crazy.
[54:10.440 --> 54:16.440]  And like asking me what's coming next. And that's not me up here going, oh, look, famous people call me asking for advice.
[54:16.440 --> 54:21.440]  It means people are finally not being naive anymore.
[54:21.440 --> 54:26.440]  And so it's almost I don't have God works like almost the point they put me in prison or kill me is when I'm obsolete.
[54:26.440 --> 54:29.440]  I've done my job.
[54:29.440 --> 54:35.440]  And then they're going to have the military, I guess at one point liberate the prison I'm in because that's literally where
[54:35.440 --> 54:40.440]  this is going.
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.440]  That's what a bunch of famous war heroes. This is the day I was talking to someone. They said, Alex, don't worry.
[54:44.440 --> 54:48.440]  We're going to win this one or the other. We have to bust your ass out. We will.
[54:48.440 --> 54:53.440]  But I mean, that's the point, ladies and gentlemen, that this is all gotten to.
[54:53.440 --> 54:56.440]  That's how real it is right beneath the surface.
[54:56.440 --> 55:04.440]  And I just want more Americans to realize what we're what we're facing. So let me tell you what's coming up.
[55:04.440 --> 55:10.440]  Do you know how big it is that it's confirmed that not just the Chinese, but the U.S. kits were contaminated?
[55:10.440 --> 55:12.440]  They said from the laboratories.
[55:12.440 --> 55:17.440]  And because they know the FBI might actually do its job instead of going after patriots.
[55:17.440 --> 55:20.440]  They cover their ass and tell you the cover up in the story.
[55:20.440 --> 55:25.440]  They go, oh, we were making the test in a lab that had live COVID. It's an accident.
[55:25.440 --> 55:30.440]  Oh, yeah, it's an accident. Sure.
[55:30.440 --> 55:34.440]  They do this stuff in moon suits, man. So.
[55:34.440 --> 55:39.440]  They've been caught there. The CDC's had to admit it. That is ultra massive.
[55:39.440 --> 55:43.440]  And then we've got all the other news. I haven't even hit yet, but we will cover it all.
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.440]  Britain's deserted hospitals. Remember a few months ago, we kept showing videos of the hospitals.
[55:47.440 --> 55:51.440]  The folks said, oh, that's a fake video. Those hospitals aren't empty when they show on the news.
[55:51.440 --> 55:55.440]  They're jam packed. Everyone's dying to enter the world, run for the hills.
[55:55.440 --> 55:59.440]  It's all over. And now it turns out they're totally empty.
[55:59.440 --> 56:02.440]  We've got all of that. Even mainstream news admits it.
[56:02.440 --> 56:05.440]  And tens of thousands are dying every week of diseases.
[56:05.440 --> 56:09.440]  They're not treating. They're not giving people all their essential medical care in the name of COVID.
[56:09.440 --> 56:15.440]  That's all coming up.
[56:15.440 --> 56:19.440]  And so much more, so much more next hour.
[56:19.440 --> 56:24.440]  Again, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. slams Bill Gates as the World Health Organization over vaccines
[56:24.440 --> 56:27.440]  that killed more children in Africa than diseases it targeted.
[56:27.440 --> 56:30.440]  Wow, which is true. But to have him coming out.
[56:30.440 --> 56:33.440]  I've seen Robert Kennedy, Jr. actually getting more hardcore.
[56:33.440 --> 56:36.440]  I've heard criticism of him lately that he's not doing enough.
[56:36.440 --> 56:38.440]  I think it's because he's doing what he's supposed to now.
[56:38.440 --> 56:41.440]  I think we're seeing some stuff there.
[56:41.440 --> 56:48.440]  Next hour is coming up. If you want to win this info war, you need to realize you're in a war.
[56:48.440 --> 56:50.440]  And you need to realize how incredibly important you are.
[56:50.440 --> 56:54.440]  You may be old, you may be black, you may be young, you may be white, you may be Hispanic, you may be Asian.
[56:54.440 --> 56:58.440]  You're red-blooded, you want to live, you want freedom? I need you, you need me.
[56:58.440 --> 57:00.440]  We're wearing this together.
[57:00.440 --> 57:02.440]  Word of mouth spreading the live feed of the show.
[57:02.440 --> 57:04.440]  Word of mouth sharing the articles and videos.
[57:04.440 --> 57:06.440]  Word of mouth telling folks about local stations you're watching and listening to.
[57:06.440 --> 57:08.440]  That's King Daddy right there.
[57:08.440 --> 57:10.440]  That's why they're pissed because they haven't been able to shut this down
[57:10.440 --> 57:13.440]  because your human word of mouth is overriding them.
[57:13.440 --> 57:15.440]  So get these videos and articles out.
[57:15.440 --> 57:18.440]  If you do one thing for yourself, please.
[57:18.440 --> 57:21.440]  Please. I mean, I'm going to pay for my life for this.
[57:21.440 --> 57:23.440]  I already know that, but it's okay.
[57:23.440 --> 57:25.440]  Just please, can you get this out?
[57:25.440 --> 57:27.440]  A live Sunday coronavirus news briefing.
[57:27.440 --> 57:30.440]  Doctors across the U.S. come forward to defend Trump.
[57:30.440 --> 57:32.440]  All right, you need to get that feed out.
[57:32.440 --> 57:35.440]  It's all there. The live show, all the band videos.
[57:35.440 --> 57:37.440]  The reason we built Band-Aid video.
[57:37.440 --> 57:40.440]  The reason we spent tens of millions of dollars to put up the satellites.
[57:40.440 --> 57:43.440]  The reason we're here is we knew this was coming and we had to be in position.
[57:43.440 --> 57:54.440]  Hour number two coming up.
[58:13.440 --> 58:15.440]  You know what? I didn't do that.
[58:15.440 --> 58:20.440]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient.
[58:20.440 --> 58:21.440]  People are deficient.
[58:21.440 --> 58:23.440]  I had added so many other issues.
[58:23.440 --> 58:25.440]  You need those products regardless.
[58:25.440 --> 58:29.440]  So we started selling out of vitamin, mineral fusion, all the other products.
[58:29.440 --> 58:33.440]  I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off
[58:33.440 --> 58:36.440]  because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis
[58:36.440 --> 58:40.440]  to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies' defenses.
[58:40.440 --> 58:43.440]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on,
[58:43.440 --> 58:46.440]  get your storable food now.
[58:46.440 --> 58:51.440]  Authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you
[58:51.440 --> 58:55.440]  to stay in your houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you can go.
[58:55.440 --> 58:57.440]  It's called martial law.
[58:57.440 --> 58:59.440]  It's called living in the authoritarian country.
[58:59.440 --> 59:02.440]  Everybody knows that. Everybody understands that.
[59:02.440 --> 59:05.440]  And the Democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state
[59:05.440 --> 59:10.440]  saying, we're going to listen to Fauci and the World Health Organization
[59:10.440 --> 59:13.440]  who've done nothing but put out all this fake disinformation so far.
[59:13.440 --> 59:15.440]  We're not going to listen to the president.
[59:15.440 --> 59:17.440]  We're not going to listen to Congress.
[59:17.440 --> 59:21.440]  But then all these other corporations are going to work in tandem with big tech
[59:21.440 --> 59:24.440]  to surveil and control and keep things shut down.
[59:24.440 --> 59:26.440]  This is economic warfare.
[59:26.440 --> 59:28.440]  And I know everybody understands that.
[59:28.440 --> 59:31.440]  Public with the president and others need to develop a plan
[59:31.440 --> 59:35.440]  to understand that this is a global corporate civil war
[59:35.440 --> 59:37.440]  and that we're being held hostage.
[59:37.440 --> 59:41.440]  And this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces.
[59:41.440 --> 59:45.440]  Only understanding the reality, the magnitude of that,
[59:45.440 --> 59:47.440]  gives us any chance of defeating it.
[59:55.440 --> 59:59.440]  For more than two decades, I have analyzed the architecture
[59:59.440 --> 1:00:03.440]  of the globalist system, who runs it, how it operates,
[1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:05.440]  what its goals are, what makes it tick.
[1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:11.440]  And so we knew that the heart of it was a worldwide medical dictatorship
[1:00:11.440 --> 1:00:15.440]  because that's true power over populations is who can have children,
[1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:17.440]  what type of drugs and medicines you can take,
[1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:20.440]  what type of inoculations you're forced to take.
[1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:24.440]  Authoritarians over the last 200 years really began to notice
[1:00:24.440 --> 1:00:30.440]  that armies invading or taking over get resisted.
[1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:36.440]  But if you can do it through the cover of medical necessity
[1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:41.440]  and if you can pose as the guardian of civilization and society,
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:45.440]  then you can really stampede people into doing whatever you want.
[1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:49.440]  And again, for 26 years studying the whole globalist system,
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:54.440]  Bill Gates and the big foundations he represents
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:57.440]  have been at the heart of this entire dehumanization operation.
[1:00:57.440 --> 1:01:01.440]  And so it's with very heavy heart that I realize
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:04.440]  that I just have to trust in God and her over to God at this point
[1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.440]  because the last two months with the lockdown
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:11.440]  and them rolling out the plan exactly as we predicted they would
[1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:15.440]  confirms to me that they're going to execute the next phases of their plans.
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:19.440]  So they're coming with forced inoculations next year.
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:23.440]  They're coming to not let you travel or have a job or live
[1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:27.440]  unless you don't just submit to COVID-19 vaccine
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:31.440]  and the Trojan Horse Nanotech, they admit they're going to put it.
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:35.440]  But they're also coming with all of these other so-called vaccines
[1:01:35.440 --> 1:01:39.440]  that actually go in and attack different parts of the brain
[1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:44.440]  and actually destroy parts of the brain associated with spiritual connections
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:48.440]  and deep emotions in higher levels of brainwaves.
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:51.440]  They call these anti-stress vaccines, anti-drug vaccines.
[1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:53.440]  They've had it for more than 20 years.
[1:01:53.440 --> 1:01:57.440]  They've been experimenting on them with mental patients and the military and others.
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:01:59.440]  And it is so draconian.
[1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:03.440]  So when they call something a vaccine, it's not the classic learned immunity
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:07.440]  like a 500-year-old smallpox vaccination that still had side effects
[1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:11.440]  and was dangerous, but in many cases did give people learned immunity
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:14.440]  when they were healthy instead of getting sick when they were run down
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.440]  which had a higher chance of morbidity.
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:20.440]  That's all real science. It's still Russian roulette, very, very dangerous.
[1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:24.440]  But now to have Bill Gates out in the open announcing World Government,
[1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:29.440]  announcing a digital ink that will be in the vaccine, this is official.
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:34.440]  ID 2020 and other systems to be connected to your bank accounts
[1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:36.440]  so that it'll be the new global currency
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:41.440]  is just a giant leap forward into this control system.
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.440]  So I've been down on air.
[1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:46.440]  I know listeners have been pretty upset and bummed out.
[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:49.440]  But the good news is this shows revelation is true.
[1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:51.440]  It shows God is real. It shows prophecy is real.
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:55.440]  And in my experience studying the New World War, they are Satanists.
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:56.440]  They believe in the devil.
[1:02:56.440 --> 1:03:00.440]  So so many people say, oh, that's the Jewish God or that's the Christian God
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:02.440]  and that's your cosmology.
[1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:04.440]  You know, the Chinese don't have that.
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:06.440]  This group doesn't believe that.
[1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:09.440]  Well, actually, ladies and gentlemen, if you study every ancient culture,
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:11.440]  they believe in evil. They believe in evil spirits.
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:15.440]  They believe in good. The Native Americans did. Every culture did.
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:19.440]  And these are all ways that ancient cultures were able to, you know,
[1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:23.440]  basically look at what they saw unfolding the world and give us some type of meaning.
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:26.440]  But regardless whether you believe in the spiritual world or not,
[1:03:26.440 --> 1:03:28.440]  the globalists are manifesting it.
[1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:32.440]  They're pushing these archetypes and they believe it and they're actually building it.
[1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:36.440]  So whether you believe in Jesus Christ and the God of the Bible and revelations or not,
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:39.440]  this system is being built and is anti-human.
[1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:43.440]  They're not trying to make us take microchips to all live in tomb by our Heaven.
[1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:46.440]  They're doing it to literally remove us out of the world,
[1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:49.440]  dehumanize us and then build a post-human planet.
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:52.440]  So this is, wake up and say no or be destroyed forever.
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:55.440]  I'm Alex Jones. Thank you for watching.
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:58.440]  Well, I tell you, all of our crew that puts videos together have been on fire.
[1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:03.440]  But Gregory's just been knocking out of the park. It's an all-star team here every week
[1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:05.440]  putting up with me and the work we're getting out.
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:07.440]  And we've definitely got the globalist attention.
[1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:09.440]  We've got the listeners' attention.
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:12.440]  The globalists want to silence you. They want to demoralize you.
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:14.440]  They don't want you to believe you have power.
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:16.440]  They don't want you aware of what they're doing.
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:23.440]  But when I see good police and military across the country waking up and taking action,
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:31.440]  when I see all these great medical doctors coming forward and just saying it's a total fraud,
[1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:33.440]  it's a total lie, it's a total scam,
[1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:38.440]  and when I see the federal SWAT teams attacking medical doctors trying to intimidate them
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:43.440]  to not be the leaders they are, it's the end of the new world order.
[1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:45.440]  It's going to get really rough the next few years.
[1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:48.440]  But in the end, the tide is turning against the enemy.
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:53.440]  Just get right with God and put your head down and don't back down.
[1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:21.440]  You're going to have to take the economy and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[1:05:21.440 --> 1:05:25.440]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations,
[1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:28.440]  brainwash your kids the way they say, and have absolutely no freedom.
[1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:30.440]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:32.440]  This is a giant revolution.
[1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:34.440]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said,
[1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:36.440]  oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks.
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:39.440]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years.
[1:05:39.440 --> 1:05:42.440]  It never ends. No one can ever die from a virus again.
[1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:44.440]  Government will save you.
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:46.440]  It's a takeover. It's the opposite.
[1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:48.440]  They're coming with force inoculations on record.
[1:05:48.440 --> 1:05:51.440]  They'll reduce your fertility, lower your immunity,
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:53.440]  and in many cases, kill you.
[1:05:53.440 --> 1:06:21.440]  And they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[1:06:21.440 --> 1:06:27.440]  The anatomy of a coronavirus conspiracy theory from theweek.com.
[1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:30.440]  And I am the main subject of this article,
[1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:34.440]  but they've got a bunch of other Trump supporters and the president himself in there.
[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:44.440]  And they say, man, Alex Jones claims the federal government is coming to take over and have martial law.
[1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:46.440]  The federal government's the enemy, but he goes,
[1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:50.440]  actually it's the federal government under Trump that's saying things aren't as bad
[1:06:50.440 --> 1:06:56.440]  as reasonable, loving doctors and mayors and counties and cities are.
[1:06:56.440 --> 1:06:59.440]  Well, those are the doctors and mayors in the blue states.
[1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:01.440]  The blue cities under globalist control.
[1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:03.440]  And in fact, you know, a lot of those blue cities and states,
[1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:07.440]  prestigious doctors are coming out saying that they're saying the opposite.
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:10.440]  So it says, Gore Vidal wanted to blow up Oklahoma City.
[1:07:10.440 --> 1:07:12.440]  He didn't say that.
[1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:19.440]  And they say Jones has this racist rant where he describes being
[1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:21.440]  basically robbed in a parking lot with your family.
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:25.440]  And if you get in the car and put your handcuffs on, they're going to take you to your house.
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:28.440]  They're going to rob your safe, rob you, get your bank accounts and then kill you,
[1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:32.440]  which is a normal, you know, homicidal thing that some robbers do.
[1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:34.440]  You see it a lot by normal.
[1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:35.440]  It's a pretty common occurrence.
[1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:38.440]  They said that that was racist.
[1:07:38.440 --> 1:07:44.440]  Actually, in the rant, I talked about Ted Bundy and his little non-threatening yellow Volkswagen.
[1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:48.440]  I said, let's imagine you and your family are in a parking lot and you get grabbed by.
[1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:50.440]  So actually talk about a white guy in that context.
[1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:58.440]  But imagine how they just inject that, how cult-like that is, that I'm saying once you put the martial law handcuffs on,
[1:07:58.440 --> 1:08:03.440]  it causes a chain reaction and an implosion of the economy that now the U.N.
[1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:08.440]  admits is causing an extra 20 million people to starve to death on top of the 10 million already starving to death,
[1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:13.440]  30 million starving to death, hundreds of thousands have already died by the global shutdown.
[1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:17.440]  In many areas of the third world, people are on a subsistence level.
[1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:25.440]  So my whole rant that they took for this article was about the mass murder and the breakdown of the culture
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:32.440]  and all the patients not getting their medical care and us not being called essential as humans
[1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:37.440]  and how that's the next level of racism that government corporations tell you who's essential.
[1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:46.440]  The article is the most sophisticated fraud, the anatomy of a coronavirus conspiracy theory.
[1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:54.440]  And it's just really interesting reading because it ends by America came together and shut down to save lives.
[1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:58.440]  You just don't get that, you make it something sinister.
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:07.440]  Bill Gates, financing the NIH in 2012 to 2017, transferring weaponized coronaviruses to the Wuhan lab,
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:12.440]  was in The Science Journal and all over the news five years ago.
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:17.440]  I remember covering it, why are you transferring weaponized airborne viruses with gain of function
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:23.440]  that are multivirus species chimeras?
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:27.440]  So they can't handle real information.
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:32.440]  How scary is it, Bill Gates coming back out yesterday and saying, we're not going to reopen for a while?
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:34.440]  Well, that means total depression worldwide.
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:39.440]  Or the fact that they had five million dead in their first projections, then two million dead and one million dead.
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:44.440]  And they said, if you do everything we say, it's going to be 304,000 dead this year in the United States.
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:45.440]  But that's not the case.
[1:09:45.440 --> 1:09:54.440]  And now we learn they're counting every person that dies of a gunshot wound, a car wreck, cancer, kidney failure, HIV.
[1:09:54.440 --> 1:10:01.440]  If you've got any test positive for COVID, which is any coronavirus, or even the flu virus, it's false positives, they admit.
[1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:04.440]  Well, you're then counted as someone that died from it.
[1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:05.440]  So that's thrown in the hopper.
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:16.440]  So we now officially know this is their giant globalist scion.
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:18.440]  And he says, you will take my vaccine.
[1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:21.440]  There's no normal till you take my vaccine.
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:23.440]  So let's look at this right now.
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:27.440]  CDC's failed coronavirus tests were tainted with coronavirus.
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:29.440]  Feds confirm.
[1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:38.440]  Ars Technica, this is from Friday, it's got a link to the CDC.
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:42.440]  And then it's their kits were in a lab that was contaminated.
[1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.440]  But oh, they're medical.
[1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:45.440]  It's OK if they do that.
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:46.440]  It's an emergency.
[1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:47.440]  They're spreading.
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:52.440]  I remember Fauci would let people fly in from China, even after Trump had blocked it on CDC flights.
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:58.440]  They'd let people out with COVID-19 on the streets of Texas because they wanted to outbreak folks.
[1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.440]  Because Fauci got 100 million from Gates.
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:08.440]  China gave faulty contaminated COVID-19 equipment to several countries.
[1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:14.440]  Some coronavirus testing kits found to be contaminated with coronavirus report.
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:15.440]  It's not a raw story.
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:17.440]  It's an AP article.
[1:11:17.440 --> 1:11:20.440]  CDC lab for coronavirus test kits may be contaminated.
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:21.440]  That was an old Fox News report.
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:24.440]  But now it's confirmed.
[1:11:24.440 --> 1:11:26.440]  Now it's all confirmed.
[1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:33.440]  Countries criticized China for sending and resending faulty coronavirus kits and supplies.
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:38.440]  And China tried to patent potential coronavirus drug.
[1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:44.440]  From Vesadir, the day after Beijing confirmed the virus was transmittable between humans.
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:45.440]  And who's got a piece of that?
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:52.440]  The Wuhan lab, where they tested all this, where they got it from Obama in the last 10 years before Trump got in.
[1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:54.440]  Just a fact.
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:58.440]  And then Danielle Anderson that works at the lab is the head Facebook fact checker.
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:00.440]  Overall, COVID-19 information worldwide.
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:02.440]  It doesn't tell you she worked there.
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:03.440]  She thinks you're too done to look it up.
[1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:06.440]  And then it gets worse.
[1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:12.440]  She is part owner in developing the test that's being used right now that's making massive amounts of money.
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:13.440]  She works at the lab.
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:14.440]  She's involved in the test.
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:15.440]  She's covering up.
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:16.440]  It came out of the lab.
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:20.440]  She'll probably get an FBI award for excellence in saving humanity.
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:24.440]  She'll probably be there when I'm putting a guillotine in your own.
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:25.440]  And the FBI will hit a button.
[1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:26.440]  Like, Jones is bad.
[1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:27.440]  You're good.
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:28.440]  Danielle Anderson, we love you.
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:29.440]  You're the good guy.
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:39.440]  This is what our country's turned into with the FBI rating vitamin C medical doctor facilities that have been around for over a decade.
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:40.440]  They're everywhere.
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:44.440]  Legal, lawful vitamins and minerals that people are getting intervenously.
[1:12:44.440 --> 1:12:51.440]  And folks see the news articles about vitamin C treating COVID-19 intervenously and the successful studies.
[1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:53.440]  And so they say, oh, that's unauthorized use.
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:13:01.440]  So they swat team it in hazmat outfits.
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:06.440]  And again, that's because they were ordered to do so.
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:12.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, by the deep state, the bureaucracy works for the globalists.
[1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:20.440]  Since we're mentioning that, let me, let me dig up some of those studies and show you those on vitamin C.
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:24.440]  That's the Cedar Sinai study right there when they're doing with the light inside the lungs.
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:25.440]  But Trump made that up.
[1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:26.440]  He's able.
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:27.440]  It doesn't exist.
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:28.440]  He's very bad.
[1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:30.440]  Just don't think, you know, glad YouTube took the video down.
[1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:33.440]  It's a band up video, but we'll probably swap team for that as well.
[1:13:33.440 --> 1:13:38.440]  How dare you put a Cedar Sinai scientist confirming Trump will have you arrested.
[1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:44.440]  YouTube censors video about UV light treatment used for coronavirus because the New York Times complained.
[1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:48.440]  World's first trial that has benefit of intervening is zinc and COVID-19.
[1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:49.440]  Just what Trump said.
[1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:51.440]  Injections by medical doctors in the body.
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:53.440]  Of things to clean you out.
[1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:55.440]  Inhibition of H1N1 influenza.
[1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:58.440]  Big studies about zinc oxide in the lungs.
[1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:00.440]  Effective zinc salts.
[1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:04.440]  Repertory virus replication.
[1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:06.440]  And then where is my stack?
[1:14:06.440 --> 1:14:07.440]  I had a big stack.
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:10.440]  Oh, I found it.
[1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:11.440]  Here it is.
[1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:18.440]  FBI Rage Detroit area medical facility for using intervening is vitamin C to treat COVID-19 patients in force.com.
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:19.440]  You actually read.
[1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:22.440]  It's just a facility that gives people vitamin C that's totally legal.
[1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:23.440]  Someone complained.
[1:14:23.440 --> 1:14:24.440]  They thought that happened.
[1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:29.440]  So they went after me said, Oh, unauthorized treatment despite all of the studies.
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:32.440]  New York hospitals treating coronavirus patients with vitamin C.
[1:14:32.440 --> 1:14:39.440]  New York post and then a big giant world university boil down article from pharma nutrition.
[1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:43.440]  We're all over the world from Japan to Saudi Arabia to Europe to the United States.
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:47.440]  All the studies on how they're treating things like that with it.
[1:14:47.440 --> 1:14:55.440]  But you're not supposed to have hope because Bill Gates only wants you to have the hope that he will give you a tainted vaccine.
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:12.440]  And look at this article Britain deserted hospitals cancer victims forgotten vital operations canceled and ghost town A&Es.
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:23.440]  Remember all the videos of the tick tock dancing and they're doing last supper videos and all the rest of it and having these parties in there because they're totally empty.
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:25.440]  And then people go cover.
[1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:27.440]  They go, I saw in the news that my local hospitals overwhelmed.
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:28.440]  I went there.
[1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:30.440]  No one's there.
[1:15:30.440 --> 1:15:32.440]  YouTube bans your video.
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:33.440]  If you're a citizen, you get in a car.
[1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:35.440]  You got a YouTube, but you're literally baseball team.
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:37.440]  You decide to go check this out.
[1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:38.440]  Find us not true.
[1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:41.440]  They ban you because you're a dirty, filthy American.
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:43.440]  You're lucky you're not arrested.
[1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:46.440]  Keep your mouth shut.
[1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:49.440]  Including medical doctors that are out there.
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:51.440]  They need to keep their mouth shut.
[1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:53.440]  That's why we're going to do the bill.
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:56.440]  Gates says period.
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:04.440]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non essential.
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:17.440]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:27.440]  They're making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out, they can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.440]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[1:16:30.440 --> 1:16:34.440]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:36.440]  We can be told to stay on our houses.
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:38.440]  After all, shut up.
[1:16:38.440 --> 1:16:40.440]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[1:16:40.440 --> 1:16:44.440]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:46.440]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[1:16:46.440 --> 1:16:49.440]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:55.440]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:17:00.440]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality, horrible food.
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:04.440]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown.
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:12.440]  It would cause, because the globalists were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:17.440]  Now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running an operation.
[1:17:17.440 --> 1:17:21.440]  It's not predictions. We have their battle plans.
[1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:26.440]  So, going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storeable food companies were sold out,
[1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:29.440]  except my Patreon supply, because they're the biggest and we're pre-positioned.
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:32.440]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in,
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:35.440]  that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:37.440]  They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up.
[1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:43.440]  Well, now they're caught back up. They've got high quality, horrible food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you.
[1:17:43.440 --> 1:17:48.440]  Get your orders in now at infowarstore.com to go right at the head of the queue
[1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:51.440]  to get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the info store.
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:18:07.440]  I'm always excited about info wars life products. They're amazing. They're cutting edge. You love them. I love them.
[1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:10.440]  And they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:17.440]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:22.440]  There's a lot up of it, and there's another innovation. It's the spray cap.
[1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:30.440]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:33.440]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:36.440]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:40.440]  But I just love it. Personally, it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:42.440]  So, this is a real innovation.
[1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:47.440]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it
[1:18:47.440 --> 1:19:13.440]  so it doesn't dry you out and smells great. It's so refreshing, this is a big winner.
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:22.440]  It's specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:33.440]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:45.440]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:51.440]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store. Never been a better time than right now.
[1:19:51.440 --> 1:20:07.440]  Super male vitality at infostore.com.
[1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:34.440]  The West is the best. Get here and we'll do the rest.
[1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:36.440]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:20:36.440 --> 1:20:57.440]  So President Trump with 109 days left to the election is being driven from office right now and it was always the plan to use a plague like this
[1:20:57.440 --> 1:21:02.440]  and the hype that results around it because the flu every year is a plague killing 35,000 people.
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:06.440]  So it's a real thing. They're just hyping up something new, something they produce.
[1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:10.440]  So they own it. They own the patents. They own the vaccine. Nobody else can own it.
[1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:13.440]  It's their own little genetic creation, their own little chimera.
[1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:18.440]  Bill Gates is a little baby so he can save you from his monster.
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:22.440]  And then nobody else can have a treatment. Nobody else can hurt his monster.
[1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:30.440]  Nobody else can defeat his monster because only Bill Gates and the big eugenics boards and the globalists behind him.
[1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:32.440]  Only they're allowed to be the savers.
[1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:35.440]  And it's come out that they flew the people here and tried to block Trump blocking him.
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:39.440]  It's come out that they had the test kits that were tainted.
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:45.440]  It's come out that everybody on that stage with him works for Bill Gates.
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:49.440]  People are literally freaking out. They're just saying, how did you know about Bill Gates?
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:51.440]  Why'd you harp on him? Why'd you make films about him?
[1:21:51.440 --> 1:22:01.440]  Because I studied the architecture of the New World Order, folks, and Bill Gates doesn't run any of this. He's just the front man for the whole thing.
[1:22:01.440 --> 1:22:04.440]  So the video's up on infowars.com.
[1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:11.440]  Schiff, remember, discredited after Russia Gate, discredited after the whole impeachment scam?
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:14.440]  All that coming out?
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:20.440]  Well, Schiff says that not removing Trump led to the 50,000 American deaths. That's right.
[1:22:20.440 --> 1:22:27.440]  It's almost all in blue cities where the Democrats had their parties and said everybody should go out while they were trying to incubate it.
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:31.440]  They weren't sure it was going to take hold. They were all unified.
[1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:43.440]  And now when Trump tries to reopen things, because the depression is going to be 100 times more devastating and 30 million people are starving down the third world, they depend on us.
[1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:49.440]  Well then, we're just not supposed to remember that.
[1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:59.440]  Or think about that, but that's going to be irrevocable. And oh, there's always Piers Morgan, Trump's supposed buddy, stabbing him in the back.
[1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:15.440]  Here's Morgan. Trump's coronavirus cure theories will kill. You just saw me in the last hour lay out all the different mainline university studies and the Cedar Sinai and all of it.
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:29.440]  That what Trump was saying was real. Every bit of it was real known treatments that are mainstream news that are promising that they don't want us to discuss or know about.
[1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:37.440]  And then I was listening to talk radio today and flipping through music channels on the back porch.
[1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:47.440]  You know, non-digital radio actually listens to the stations and it was like tuning through stations and it was like, do whatever you have to stay indoors, be a hero.
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:50.440]  Don't go out. Don't open the economy and keep your distance.
[1:23:50.440 --> 1:23:56.440]  Next channel. That's what corporate America wants because they're all getting their bailouts. Jeff Bezos got his $30 billion bailout.
[1:23:56.440 --> 1:24:08.440]  Your actual store is not going to get any bailout. And so this is siege. This is the shutdown. This is what the environmentalists always said they wanted was a way to end the industrial world, to end the service economy.
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:22.440]  First, they had to get rid of your industrial economy. Then they got rid of your service economy and they're saying all of you that are in service are non-essential.
[1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:30.440]  So how does it feel to be told that you're non-essential? And again, I've got 100 video clips and hundreds of articles here to cover.
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:40.440]  I think it drives me crazy about this certain shirt, though, this collar. I don't have a tick to pull my collar. It drives me crazy. I keep falling down. It drives me nuts.
[1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:47.440]  You got to ask yourself, I mean, do you see through this? Do you know what's going on? Do you know what's happening? Do you want to be conned by this?
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:56.440]  Because you're all told, oh, be good. Oh, be heroes. Oh, you're so great. Oh, don't talk to anybody. Oh, shut down. Oh, don't resist anything.
[1:24:56.440 --> 1:25:11.440]  Oh, you're so good doing this and all you're doing is destroying your birthright, destroying your future and putting us into a irrevocable depression that'll kill 10, 20, 30 times what this virus did and creating a precedent where a medical tyranny run by the most evil foundations on Earth
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:22.440]  and the UN controls your every life and wants to put implantable microchip in you and track everywhere you go and everything you do.
[1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:31.440]  And then they admit, OK, the hospitals in the UK are four times emptier than they've ever been. The hospitals in the US are three times emptier.
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:46.440]  And it's confirmed that all those reports of six weeks ago, five weeks ago, four weeks ago, three weeks ago of empty hospitals and fake newscast with even actors hired to our hazmat suits.
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:55.440]  Like they were guessed going in the loaded hospital and people on gurneys in China flopping around like they were dying. Yeah, there was some real death.
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:06.440]  Gads are real virus, but they photo bombed us with it. They told their people fearmonger. They shot lots of fake videos that were authorized by the government to create total fear.
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:12.440]  And even US intelligence came out on Thursday in the New York Times and people go, wait a minute.
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:28.440]  But the New York Times is bad. Not if we take America back. The New York Times worked for the globalists, but now they have the documents they can't even deny because Chinese diplomats are on record pumping and propagandizing and paying US companies and US media to create as much fear as possible.
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:37.440]  Communist China is on record funding. Why do you think the last five years there's been hundreds of TV shows and movies about racist white people hunting and killing black people?
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:46.440]  It's been to create the perception that there's this race war to divide us. That didn't work. They were going to go with the race war.
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:49.440]  In fact, lockstep put up with the Rockefellers 10 years ago.
[1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:58.440]  They wanted a culture war first. Plan B was a bio weapon release or they call a simulate that kills some people, but that they know is going to burn out.
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:11.440]  But they can use to panic you. All you need is a gunshot or a backfire or somebody kicking over a milk can to make cows spook, to make cows get scared, to get livings to get scared.
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:21.440]  Then they run over each other and run over the cliff and that's what they're doing is scaring all of us and they've got a formulaic plan and they know what they are doing.
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:30.440]  Why do you think you have DNC leaders, white and black all over the news running around saying white people are inherently bad?
[1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:39.440]  There's a new video out to get to today. NationalFile.com is the one in fours.com caught on tape. Stacey Abrams plotted to use redistricting to quote stop white people.
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:53.440]  By the hell would you make a statement like that? Because they want to create from the DNC down a race based system so they can divide people that have melon in their skin from people that don't have a much melon in their skin so they can continue to play us.
[1:27:53.440 --> 1:28:01.440]  Because the last thing they want is us to come together and demand our basic freedoms and justice for everybody now.
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:12.440]  I tell you, it's just an incredible time to be alive. All right, we're going to go to break. And the full interview is posted on infowars.com and I'm just tempted to play the whole thing.
[1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:23.440]  But I want to get into the censorship of CNN and Google working together of the woman calling out about her daughter being abused by Joe Biden, which is a confirmed case.
[1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:32.440]  And YouTube, Google, now Twitter is doing it. They're all taking it down and saying, so what if Joe Biden raped somebody? So again, it's all about their double standard.
[1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:39.440]  No proof of Kavanaugh. Proof, though, with this guy who can't keep his damn hands off anybody.
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:53.440]  Let me tell you, somebody walks over and grabs my five-year-old, starts kissing her on the hair and rubbing on her shoulders. I'm gonna knock them upside their dirty head. They'll probably arrest me for a threat against Biden. I didn't say that. I said an old pervert like him tried that. I defend my daughter, which I know is a crime.
[1:28:53.440 --> 1:29:20.440]  This whole thing's run by pedophiles.
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:30.440]  Why you and myself, everybody else has to get prepared now. Do not wait. It's not about the virus. It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year.
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:39.440]  Get your high-quality, swarble foods at infowars.com. They're available again before a limited time. The food supply is running out. There are major shortages.
[1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:51.440]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism, but we the people, the patriots, have to be prepared. We've already been proven right about prepping so far. We'll get ready to be really proven right.
[1:29:51.440 --> 1:29:57.440]  Get your swarble foods now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:29:57.440 --> 1:30:08.440]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:35.440]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine is the infowarstore hotline.
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:42.440]  Infowarstore.com is simply the best. Infowarstore.com beats out all the rest.
[1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:56.440]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine is the infowarstore hotline.
[1:30:56.440 --> 1:31:11.440]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[1:31:11.440 --> 1:31:28.440]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:42.440]  This is insane. Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over. You need to get prepared now. You need to get high quality storeable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[1:31:42.440 --> 1:31:54.440]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing. This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here, get prepared now and spread the word in the infowar.
[1:31:54.440 --> 1:32:01.440]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:38.440]  This is our best selling overall formula. And I've told listeners at the end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them to fund our operations.
[1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:55.440]  But because of what's happening and going on in the world right now, I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family. DNA Force Plus now 50% off.
[1:33:08.440 --> 1:33:25.440]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:38.440]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide at two segments left and I'll be back with a weekday show at 11am, the 3pm Central while I'm still above the ground. They don't kill me or two other things to breathe on our necks folks.
[1:33:38.440 --> 1:33:51.440]  But that's okay. We expected that fight in these criminals, infowar.com, newswar.com. And they want to take us down because what we're doing is very effective and it scares the globalists in a big, big way.
[1:33:51.440 --> 1:34:05.440]  Now I was mentioning Stacey Abrams, one of the big Democratic Party operatives who is favored to be the VP running mate of Joe, the pedophile pervert Biden.
[1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:10.440]  There's a big article on nationalfile.com. Stacey Abrams went to Bilderberg.
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:21.440]  And it turns out she went last year to the globalist secretive group that they now admit exists that patriots exposed over 30 years ago. I remember just 15 years ago they still said it didn't exist.
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:32.440]  That's why she's now calling for race war in America pre-covernous, pre-coronavirus study. Social isolation makes black people more likely to die, makes everybody more likely to die.
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:44.440]  But let's shift gears to Joe Biden and the censorship. CNN removes Larry King episode with Joe Biden's accuser, mother from Google Play Archive.
[1:34:44.440 --> 1:35:00.440]  Working with Google in the full videos up on infowars.com, the background store in the lady. CNN clip on Earth of Biden accusers mother telling Larry King of problems with prominent senator.
[1:35:00.440 --> 1:35:03.440]  But the New York Times says it's okay. Here's the clip.
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:06.440]  San Luis Obispo, California. Hello.
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:22.440]  Yes, hello. I'm wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington. My daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator and could not get through with her problems at all.
[1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:27.440]  And the only thing she could have done was go to the press and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:32.440]  Nor she had a story to tell, but out of respect for the person she worked for, she didn't tell it.
[1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:33.440]  That's true.
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:39.440]  Now, but these are the people who do come to the lowest Romanos, right? The staff worker who says, I want to let you know about what's going on.
[1:35:39.440 --> 1:35:48.440]  And a lot of these people have a sense of obligation. They feel that this public official should be accountable if it's something wrong.
[1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:50.440]  The whistleblowers to the press.
[1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:51.440]  Exactly.
[1:35:51.440 --> 1:36:00.440]  And that's being removed off Twitter, Facebook, Google, you name it, other third parties that posted, CNN saying copyright.
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:05.440]  That's theirs. You're not supposed to hear about that. That's who these monsters are.
[1:36:05.440 --> 1:36:11.440]  Oh, but it's okay. Jack Dorsey has a trendy beard. He only eats once a week.
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:15.440]  I guess he eats like a small dog or something like a little boa constrictor that he is.
[1:36:15.440 --> 1:36:23.440]  I make sarcastic eats like every two days or something. Twitter's CEO unveils feature to editorialize Trump's tweets as election looms.
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:28.440]  You'll be able to go in and talk trash on the president while all that goes on in live time.
[1:36:28.440 --> 1:36:33.440]  So Trump has put up with this. We have put up with this.
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:37.440]  And so things are only going to get worse.
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:41.440]  And the deep state is holding America hostage.
[1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:46.440]  Big corporations, blue cities, blue states decided to set the example to shut down.
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:53.440]  I saw first South by Southwest Hollywood events, big tech events shutting down eight, nine weeks ago.
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:37:05.440]  And they were doing that to create the perception that everybody's got to do this so that when Trump didn't do it, every death would be his fault.
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:08.440]  And now that's indeed what every talking head is saying.
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:13.440]  Every death is his fault. It's the Donald Trump virus. It's the Donald Trump disease.
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:22.440]  It's COVID Trump 19 so that they can punish him and remove him in a full executive control because they've still got their bureaucracies.
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:27.440]  They've still got their people in place inside government, engaging in criminal activity.
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:35.440]  And because the American people have not yet really understood that things are only starting to get worse as they attempt to take full control.
[1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:39.440]  These are the times that literally try everyone's souls.
[1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:43.440]  But take heart. You don't live in North Korea.
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.440]  And I've gotten so many calls from friends and family, you know, Kim Jong-un is alive.
[1:37:48.440 --> 1:37:58.440]  You've seen his train taking to the coast side. You've seen him be, you know, gone for, you know, now more than 13 days or so.
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:01.440]  He is obese. He is a spoiled rotten brat.
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:08.440]  He's got his evil demonic sister and this little sycophantic vampire group under him and around him.
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:11.440]  And so he's sort of trying to make deals with Trump.
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:16.440]  I would say the China was probably just killed him during his next medical procedure.
[1:38:16.440 --> 1:38:18.440]  He supposedly died on the table or was brain dead.
[1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:22.440]  So it took eight minutes to put a stint into his heart because he was so fat.
[1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:28.440]  And the way they leaked that through the Chinese press, because they are mad at him for trying to make a deal with Trump,
[1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:32.440]  means that Kim Jong-un might have decided for Providence and money and wealth for his country
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:37.440]  and to try to halfway free his people the way they have a little humiliating story out at the end.
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:39.440]  And he may still be in a coma. He may still be alive.
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:45.440]  But I don't think you're going to see the vampire bat emerge from where he is.
[1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:52.440]  And it's new, even more evil acting and more out of control individual will be in control.
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:56.440]  And it'll all be trendy. Oh, it's a woman dictator. So it's okay.
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:38:58.440]  As long as it's a female doing it.
[1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:03.440]  Now, I'm going to start airing part of the hour long press conference, the end of this segment and the next,
[1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:09.440]  a boil down of it that Greg Reese put together this at Band-Aid video with this medical doctor that runs these big clinics,
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:12.440]  Dr. Dan Erickson of Bakersfield with his colleagues.
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:16.440]  But you really should watch the full press conference on Infowars.com and share it
[1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:19.440]  because they're taking this video down everywhere.
[1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:22.440]  Yeah, videos of Cedar Sinai saying Trump's right about light therapy,
[1:39:22.440 --> 1:39:26.440]  videos of doctors coming out and saying about the death they're seeing because of the lockdown.
[1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:29.440]  The globalists are truly sick. Please don't forget.
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:36.440]  It is listeners like you who've done an incredible job buying the products at Infowars.com that make this all possible.
[1:39:36.440 --> 1:39:42.440]  And we have great organic hand sanitizer and three different great sense meant.
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:47.440]  And of course, we also have it in a peppermint.
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:52.440]  We have it in. Oh, what's the other ones I've got over here?
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:54.440]  My favorite, of course, is eucalyptus.
[1:39:54.440 --> 1:39:57.440]  Those are available at infowars.com.
[1:39:57.440 --> 1:40:00.440]  And we have high quality storeable foods available again.
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:03.440]  Other folks don't have them. They're lying to you about that in most cases.
[1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:05.440]  They certainly don't have them ready to ship to you.
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:07.440]  We have high quality products at infowars.com.
[1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:08.440]  That's how we fund our operation.
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:12.440]  And for what's going on in the economy in the world, it really is smart to get prepared and have
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:17.440]  formal food that's high quality last 25 years and funds this operation.
[1:40:17.440 --> 1:40:19.440]  So the best deal out there is my patron supply. They're in our back end.
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:22.440]  They take the orders. You go right in the order it's received.
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.440]  Get your orders in now before they have to suspend orders.
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:27.440]  You get your order in, you get it.
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:31.440]  But they may have to stop orders again like I did for a few weeks because the volume is so high as people figure out
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:33.440]  that the globalists are successful.
[1:40:33.440 --> 1:40:35.440]  We're going to have a total worldwide depression.
[1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:37.440]  And now is the time to get ready before things get really bad.
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:42.440]  This lockdown is about a depression about holding us hostage until we submit to the globalist.
[1:40:42.440 --> 1:40:43.440]  That's what we cannot submit.
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:48.440]  Let's go to part of this amazing report with these doctors bucking the system in this incredible press conference.
[1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:52.440]  After testing thousands of people for COVID-19,
[1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:58.440]  Dr. Dan Erickson, co-owner of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, California,
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:06.440]  held a news conference to release their data, compare it to the CDC's data, and deliver a powerful message.
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:10.440]  COVID-19 is more present and less fatal than we were told.
[1:41:10.440 --> 1:41:14.440]  The numbers say that it is less of a danger than influenza,
[1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:19.440]  and the shelter-in-place order is causing far more damage than good.
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:23.440]  Their information is based on science, and the message is chilling.
[1:41:23.440 --> 1:41:28.440]  You can see the full video at band.video, but here's the gist of it.
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:32.440]  Does this make sense? Are we following the science?
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:38.440]  We keep hearing following the science. What is science, essentially?
[1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:42.440]  It's the study of the natural world through experiment, through observation.
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:45.440]  So that's what we're doing. We're studying the disease around us.
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:51.440]  We're making observations. We're doing testing, experiments to figure out exactly what's going on.
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:55.440]  And so this has caused some severe disruption for Accelerated,
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:41:59.440]  as we have people coming in 7 in the morning until midnight.
[1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:03.440]  We're reporting to the health department. We're calling patients back.
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:07.440]  And at the same time, our volumes have dropped significantly.
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:14.440]  The hospitals, their ICUs are empty, essentially, and they're shutting down floors.
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:17.440]  They're furloughing patients. They're furloughing doctors.
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:22.440]  So the health system has been evacuated in certain places.
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:26.440]  In New York, the health system is working at maximum capacity.
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:32.440]  In California, we're really at a minimal capacity, getting rid of our doctors and nurses,
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:34.440]  because we just don't have the volume.
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:38.440]  The hospitals don't, as I met with our CEOs twice in the last week, and we don't as well.
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:43.440]  So we're busy with paperwork for COVID, and we're all focusing on COVID.
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:47.440]  So the more you test, the more positives you get.
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:52.440]  The prevalence number goes up, and the death rate stays the same.
[1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:54.440]  So it gets smaller and smaller.
[1:42:54.440 --> 1:42:56.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:24.440 --> 1:43:26.440]  We'll be right back.
[1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:58.440]  It's been sold out for more than four months,
[1:43:58.440 --> 1:44:03.440]  but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin K formula is back in stock.
[1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:07.440]  Winter Sun. In the fall, in the winter, as you know,
[1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:12.440]  your body, when you're not getting sunlight on the skin, does not produce vitamin D3.
[1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:17.440]  So it's important to ingest it, but a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut.
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:20.440]  So you take this formula under the tongue.
[1:44:20.440 --> 1:44:24.440]  It tastes sweet naturally. Let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute,
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:28.440]  and then you swallow the rest, and it's just amazing.
[1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:32.440]  It's back in stock, and yes, we're going to offer it at 50% off,
[1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:35.440]  because that's the right thing to do during this crisis.
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:37.440]  So Winter Sun, 50% off.
[1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:40.440]  We also have Ultra 12, highest-quality B12.
[1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:43.440]  It is also available. Take it out of the tongue.
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:44.440]  50% off.
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:48.440]  Infowarstore.com, and we have X3, even though it's going to sell out.
[1:44:48.440 --> 1:44:50.440]  It's super high-quality for the iodine.
[1:44:50.440 --> 1:44:53.440]  It is 60% off, because I want you to have it right now.
[1:44:53.440 --> 1:45:22.440]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:28.440]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:31.440]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on,
[1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:33.440]  we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:38.440]  That's why we worked hard to create a new formula to support your fight against stress in your hectic day.

[1:45:56.440 --> 1:46:02.440]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half.
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:05.440]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it.
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:10.440]  So guess what happened? Along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying
[1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:13.440]  it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:16.440]  And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control.
[1:46:16.440 --> 1:46:20.440]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations,
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:24.440]  a eke microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more.
[1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:29.440]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[1:46:29.440 --> 1:46:34.440]  So remember, folks, you're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:37.440]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long.
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:38.440]  Women own their bodies.
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:42.440]  Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:46.440]  And if you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, mark the beast.
[1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:47.440]  Oh, then guess what?
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:50.440]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates
[1:46:50.440 --> 1:46:53.440]  under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face.
[1:46:53.440 --> 1:47:15.440]  They hate you and your family.
[1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:19.440]  Incidents or prevalence of 4.7 million.
[1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:24.440]  That means you have a 0.03 chance of dying from COVID-19 in the state of California.
[1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:29.440]  I also wanted to mention that 96% of people in California who get COVID recover
[1:47:29.440 --> 1:47:35.440]  with almost no significant sequelae or no significant continuing medical problems.
[1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:37.440]  So I want to look at New York State.
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:39.440]  They've been in the news a lot, right?
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:41.440]  And their numbers are critical.
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:44.440]  Let's go over their numbers.
[1:47:44.440 --> 1:47:46.440]  Cases of COVID as of yesterday.
[1:47:46.440 --> 1:47:50.440]  256,272 cases in New York State.
[1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:52.440]  Not New York City, New York, the entire state.
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:56.440]  They did a total of 649,325 tests.
[1:47:56.440 --> 1:48:01.440]  That's 39% of New Yorkers tested positive for COVID-19.
[1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:02.440]  That's their ratios.
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:04.440]  This is public data online.
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:05.440]  You can all look it up.
[1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:06.440]  How many deaths do they have?
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:10.440]  19,410 out of 19 million people,
[1:48:10.440 --> 1:48:15.440]  which is a 0.1% chance of dying from COVID in the state of New York.
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:18.440]  And they have a 92% recovery rate.
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:23.440]  If you are indeed diagnosed with COVID-19, 92% of you will recover.
[1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:27.440]  So we're seeing millions of cases, small amount of death.
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:28.440]  USA.
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:30.440]  This is a big one for us.
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:39.440]  802,590 cases as of yesterday gives us a 19.6% positive out of those who were tested.
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:42.440]  So if this is a typical extrapolation,
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:46.440]  328 million people times 19.6 is 64 million.
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:49.440]  That's a significant amount of people with COVID.
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:50.440]  It's similar to the flu.
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:53.440]  If you study the numbers in 2017 and 2018,
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:56.440]  we had 50 to 60 million with the flu.
[1:48:56.440 --> 1:48:59.440]  And we had a similar death rate.
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:03.440]  The deaths in the United States were 43,545.
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:07.440]  Similar to the flu of 2017-2018.
[1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:13.440]  We always have between 37 and 60,000 deaths in the United States every single year.
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:16.440]  No pandemic talk, no shelter in place,
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:19.440]  no shutting down in businesses, no sending doctors home.
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:22.440]  COVID-19 is one aspect of our health sector.
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:28.440]  What has it caused to have us be involved in social isolation?
[1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:33.440]  What has it caused that we are seeing the community respond to?
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:36.440]  Child molestation is increasing at a severe rate.
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:40.440]  We could go over multiple cases of children who have been molested
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:45.440]  due to angry family members who are intoxicated,
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:47.440]  who are home, who have no paycheck.
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:49.440]  These things last a lifetime.
[1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:51.440]  This isn't about a seasonal flu.
[1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:53.440]  These are things that will follow these people
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:56.440]  and affect them in a negative fashion for their life.
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:58.440]  And these are secondary effects from COVID.
[1:49:58.440 --> 1:50:00.440]  And these are for me talking to ERs,
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:02.440]  talking to my doctors,
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:04.440]  and talking to people across the country
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:06.440]  and talking at what they're seeing.
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:07.440]  Spousal abuse.
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:10.440]  We see people coming in here with black eyes and cuts on their face.
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:12.440]  It's an obvious abuse of case.
[1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:15.440]  These are things that will affect them for a lifetime,
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:17.440]  not for a season.
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:20.440]  Alcoholism, anxiety, depression, suicide.
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:25.440]  I talked to the young blood in various people in the community.
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:27.440]  I've asked them, how are things going?
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:29.440]  Suicide is spiking.
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:30.440]  Education has dropped off.
[1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:32.440]  Economic collapse.
[1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:35.440]  We're all suffering because our staff isn't here
[1:50:35.440 --> 1:50:37.440]  and we have no volume.
[1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:39.440]  These are all real things that I'm seeing every day.
[1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:41.440]  I don't read about this stuff.
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:43.440]  I'm seeing it in my clinics.
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:45.440]  We have clinics from Fresno to San Diego.
[1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:47.440]  And these things are spiking in our community.
[1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:49.440]  These things will affect people for a lifetime,
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:50.440]  not for a season.
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:52.440]  So let's make sure we're clear on that.
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:54.440]  We've gone over the statistics.
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:56.440]  Now I want to compare flu virus.
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:50:58.440]  Is this significantly different?
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:04.440]  Yes, per the CDC, 24,000 to 62,000 deaths each year.
[1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:08.440]  We had about 45 million total cases in 2017
[1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:10.440]  with about 62,000 deaths.
[1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:15.440]  Or a 0.13 chance of death from flu in the United States.
[1:51:15.440 --> 1:51:19.440]  As you know, our other numbers were 0.02.
[1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:24.440]  So the lethality of COVID-19 is much less.
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:27.440]  And then when you bring up a system of lockdown,
[1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:30.440]  you'll automatically have to compare it to a system of no lockdown.
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:34.440]  The immune system is built by exposure to antigens, viruses, bacteria.
[1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:37.440]  When you're a little child crawling on the ground,
[1:51:37.440 --> 1:51:40.440]  putting stuff in your mouth, viruses and bacteria come in.
[1:51:40.440 --> 1:51:42.440]  You form an antigen antibody complex.
[1:51:42.440 --> 1:51:44.440]  You form IgG, IgM.
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:46.440]  This is how your immune system is built.
[1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:48.440]  You don't take a small child,
[1:51:48.440 --> 1:51:50.440]  put them in bubble wrap in a room and say,
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:52.440]  go have a healthy immune system.
[1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:55.440]  This is immunology, microbiology 101.
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:58.440]  What I'm seeing is when you take human beings
[1:51:58.440 --> 1:52:01.440]  and you say, go into your house, clean all your counters.
[1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:02.440]  Why sell them down?
[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:04.440]  You're going to kill 99% of viruses and bacteria.
[1:52:04.440 --> 1:52:06.440]  Wear a mask. Don't go outside.
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:08.440]  What does it do to our immune system?
[1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:11.440]  Our immune system is used to touching.
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:15.440]  We share bacteria, Staphylococcal, Structococcal bacteria, viruses.
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:18.440]  We develop an immune response daily to this stuff.
[1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:22.440]  When you take that away from me, my immune system drops.
[1:52:22.440 --> 1:52:25.440]  As I shelter in place, my immune system drops.
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:27.440]  You keep me there for months, it drops more.
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:29.440]  And now I'm at home, hand washing vigorously,
[1:52:29.440 --> 1:52:31.440]  washing the counters,
[1:52:31.440 --> 1:52:35.440]  worried about things that are indeed what I need to survive.
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:38.440]  When a child is in a womb, you're in this protected environment.
[1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:40.440]  When you come out, you have almost no immune system.
[1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:44.440]  You develop that through touching your mouth, touching your eyes,
[1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:48.440]  virus, bacteria, virus, bacteria, immune response, IgG, IgM.
[1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:51.440]  This is how you build a strong immune system.
[1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:54.440]  Sheltering in place decreases your immune system.
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:57.440]  And then as we all come out of shelter in place with a lower immune system
[1:52:57.440 --> 1:53:00.440]  and start trading viruses, bacteria, what do you think is going to happen?
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:02.440]  Disease is going to spike.
[1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:05.440]  And then you've got disease spike amongst the hospital system
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:07.440]  with furloughed doctors and nurses.
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:11.440]  This is not the combination we want to set up for a healthy society.
[1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:13.440]  As your mask that you're wearing for days,
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:16.440]  you touch the outside of it, COVID, and then touch your mouth.
[1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:18.440]  This doesn't make any sense.
[1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:20.440]  We wear a mask in an acute setting to protect us.
[1:53:20.440 --> 1:53:22.440]  We're not wearing masks.
[1:53:22.440 --> 1:53:24.440]  Why is that?
[1:53:24.440 --> 1:53:28.440]  Because we understand microbiology, we understand immunology,
[1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:30.440]  and we want strong immune systems.
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:33.440]  I don't want to hide in my home, develop a weak immune system,
[1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:35.440]  and then come out and get disease.
[1:53:35.440 --> 1:53:39.440]  We have both been in the ER through swine flu and through bird flu.
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:41.440]  Did we shut down for those?
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:44.440]  Were they much less dangerous than COVID?
[1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:47.440]  Is the flu less dangerous than COVID?
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:49.440]  Let's look at the death rates.
[1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:51.440]  No, it's not.
[1:53:51.440 --> 1:53:53.440]  And what's interesting to me, too,
[1:53:53.440 --> 1:53:55.440]  is when someone dies in this country right now,
[1:53:55.440 --> 1:53:57.440]  they're not talking about the high blood pressure,
[1:53:57.440 --> 1:53:59.440]  the diabetes, the stroke.
[1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:01.440]  They say, do they die from COVID?
[1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:03.440]  We've been to hundreds of autopsies.
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:05.440]  You don't talk about one thing.
[1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:07.440]  You talk about co-morbidities.
[1:54:07.440 --> 1:54:09.440]  Their vessels were narrowed.
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:11.440]  Their lungs were a smoker.
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:13.440]  COVID was part of it.
[1:54:13.440 --> 1:54:15.440]  It is not the reason they died, folks.
[1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:17.440]  It is one of many reasons.
[1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:19.440]  To be so simplistic to say,
[1:54:19.440 --> 1:54:21.440]  that's a COVID death because they have COVID.
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:23.440]  You know how many people die with pneumonia?
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:25.440]  Or people that die from flu?
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:27.440]  With flu, I should say.
[1:54:27.440 --> 1:54:29.440]  It's not from flu.
[1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:32.440]  Their lungs were compromised by COPD.
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:34.440]  They had a heart attack two years ago.
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:36.440]  They have a weakened body.
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:38.440]  We aren't pressured to test for flu.
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:40.440]  But ER doctors now,
[1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:42.440]  my friends that I talked to, say, you know,
[1:54:42.440 --> 1:54:45.440]  it's interesting when I'm writing up my death report,
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:47.440]  I'm being pressured to add COVID.
[1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:49.440]  Why is that?
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:51.440]  Why are we being pressured to add COVID?
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:53.440]  To maybe increase the numbers
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:55.440]  and make it look a little bit worse than it is?
[1:54:55.440 --> 1:54:57.440]  I think so.
[1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:00.440]  When I look at the basic tenets that we know of microbiology,
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:04.440]  and I say, do we need to still shelter in place?
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:07.440]  Our answer is emphatically no.
[1:55:07.440 --> 1:55:09.440]  Do we need businesses to be shut down?
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:11.440]  Emphatically no.
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:14.440]  Do we need to test them and get them back to work?
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:16.440]  Yes, we do.
[1:55:16.440 --> 1:55:18.440]  The secondary effects that we went over,
[1:55:18.440 --> 1:55:21.440]  the child abuse, alcoholism, loss of revenue,
[1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:23.440]  all these are, in our opinion,
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:27.440]  a significantly more detrimental thing to society
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:30.440]  than a virus that has proven similar in nature
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.440]  to the seasonal flu we have every year.
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:36.440]  We need to make sure if you're going to dance
[1:55:36.440 --> 1:55:38.440]  on someone's constitutional rights,
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:40.440]  you better have a good reason.
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:42.440]  You better have a really good scientific reason
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:44.440]  and not just theory.
[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:47.440]  One of the most important things is we need our hospitals back up.
[1:55:47.440 --> 1:55:49.440]  We need our furlough doctors back.
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:51.440]  We need our nurses back because when we lift this thing,
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:53.440]  we're going to need all hands on deck.
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:55.440]  I know the local hospitals have closed two floors.
[1:55:55.440 --> 1:55:58.440]  Folks, that's not the situation you want.
[1:55:58.440 --> 1:56:01.440]  We're essentially setting ourselves up to have minimal staff
[1:56:01.440 --> 1:56:03.440]  and we're going to have significant disease.
[1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:05.440]  That's the wrong combination.
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:07.440]  And I've been working with some of the leaders
[1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:10.440]  and I've talked to, you know, the head of the CDPH.
[1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:12.440]  I've gotten their opinion on this
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:14.440]  and a lot of the leaders in Sacramento.
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:16.440]  And we're all in agreement,
[1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:20.440]  but we need to have Governor Newsom in agreement with us
[1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:22.440]  to lift this ban.
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:26.440]  I've talked to our local head of the health department
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:28.440]  and he's waiting for that.
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:30.440]  Even though they're in agreement with me,
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:32.440]  they're waiting for the powers that be to lift
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:35.440]  because the data is showing us it's time to lift.
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:38.440]  So if we don't lift, what is the reason?
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:40.440]  There's no one to sell these right now, which I did this morning.
[1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:42.440]  There was 25 people in there.
[1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:44.440]  And I can stand in line for 10 minutes,
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:46.440]  but I can't go in Cafe Rio and sit there for 10 minutes.
[1:56:46.440 --> 1:56:48.440]  Does that make sense to you guys?
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:51.440]  And I can go into Costco and I can shop with people
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:53.440]  and there's probably a couple hundred people,
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:55.440]  but I can't go in Cafe Rio.
[1:56:55.440 --> 1:56:57.440]  So big businesses are open.
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:56:59.440]  Little businesses are not.
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:02.440]  There's no science behind that as we've gone over.
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:04.440]  That is not science.
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:06.440]  There's other factors in play
[1:57:06.440 --> 1:57:08.440]  that we don't have time to go into, but it's not science.
[1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:37.440]  I want to make that clear.
[1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:40.440]  Thank you.
