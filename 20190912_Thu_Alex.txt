[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Come on, man.
[00:01.000 --> 00:03.760]  And with the local D.B.C. news,
[00:03.760 --> 00:06.400]  Evan Kujen with a chance to come back.
[00:06.400 --> 00:09.400]  For a solo performance, but tonight.
[00:09.400 --> 00:11.400]  Don't call it a comeback.
[00:11.400 --> 00:12.600]  I've been here for years,
[00:12.600 --> 00:13.600]  I'm rocking my peers,
[00:13.600 --> 00:15.000]  What's up with the fear?
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Making the tears rain down like a monsoon.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000]  Listen to the bass go boom, explosion.
[00:21.000 --> 00:23.600]  Overpowering, over the competition,
[00:23.600 --> 00:25.600]  I'm touring wreckage shop.
[00:25.600 --> 00:27.000]  When I drop these lyrics,
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.000]  that'll make you warm.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here because
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  it's time to take on the globalist.
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.000]  It's time to politically knock them out.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  Because, like LLKJ said,
[00:38.000 --> 00:40.000]  Mama said, knock you out.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  So I'm going to knock you out.
[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  I'm doing the best job I can, folks,
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.000]  to fight these globalists.
[00:47.000 --> 00:48.000]  And I come in there every day,
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  and I look at all the things they're doing.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  They admit they're doing.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  And I just want to raise the alarm
[00:55.000 --> 00:57.000]  and get people to not put up with it.
[00:57.000 --> 00:58.000]  They want us to submit.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.000]  They want to break our will.
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  I want us to resist and break through.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  Because if you submit to tyranny,
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  you become weak.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  If you fight tyranny, you become strong.
[01:06.000 --> 01:07.000]  That's just a fact.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  That's why I coined the term resistance is victory.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  Because you resist and you know you're resisting,
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  and you've got right on your side.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  Long term, the idea is invincible.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  What Vyfer Vendetta quote from the writers is absolutely true.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  Ideas are bulletproof.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  I asked Darren McBreen, who's a great researcher,
[01:29.000 --> 01:31.000]  a great newsman yesterday.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  I said, hey, get me some of the clips
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  of people celebrating killing their babies in abortion.
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  And he came in this morning, he said, hey,
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  I know you said you only want this five, six minutes long.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.000]  But he said, there's hundreds of these.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  And I said, well, what are you talking about?
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  And I got here a little bit early this morning.
[01:49.000 --> 01:50.000]  So we sat there for a while,
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  and he played me a bunch of clips I'd never seen before.
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  And it just convicted my heart to come on air and say,
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  that's why I'm so angry.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  That's why I'm so aggressive.
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  That's why I don't want to lose.
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  Because these people get off on the power trip
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  of rubbing out a little baby and its whole potential
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  and celebrating that.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  And there's nothing more satanic.
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.000]  And so if there's a radio station on the spiritual dial
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  that's hell on earth, that is the absolute bottom falling out,
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  that's these individuals.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  And this is a spiritual fight.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  And evil is manifesting itself everywhere.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.000]  And none of us are perfect.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  There's incredible pressure out there to just be angry
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  or to give into it or not to care or just go get blind drunk.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  And we can't do that.
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  And so I'm not perfect.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  You're not perfect.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  None of us are perfect.
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.000]  But we love God.
[02:39.000 --> 02:40.000]  We love justice.
[02:40.000 --> 02:42.000]  And we want to be better.
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  We have a conscience.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  And so people that love God and who are overall good people
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  were all still fallen are always feeling like, well,
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  we shouldn't be leaders because we're not perfect.
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  Well, we're pointed toward that North Star that's God.
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  And that's really our job.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  And we just need to try to do the right thing
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  and then God's going to take us the rest of the way.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  And that's really what it comes down to.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  We're seeing evil come out in the open, try to overwhelm us,
[03:09.000 --> 03:11.000]  try to break our will, try to demoralize us,
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.000]  try to make us give up.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  And that's not going to happen.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  My will is stronger than it's ever been.
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  That said, though, like a race car engine overreving
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  with the driver, you can blow the engine.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  Some of your best race horses end up having heart attacks
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  because they want to go so hard they've got so much will.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  So with great power, as they say in Spider-Man,
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  comes great responsibility.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  And all of us have great power that God's given us.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  And now it's time to use it to get out there in every way we can
[03:38.000 --> 03:41.000]  to go speak at city council and the student groups
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  and the PTA meetings and the college boards
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  and the water district and the dog catcher
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  and the legislature and Congress.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  And there's no citizens there.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  Or they have hat in their hand real scared
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.000]  like they're talking to a God going into their office buildings.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  And there's just lobbyists and politicians and hangers on
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  and aides all arrogantly stomping around,
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  faking it until they make it.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  And instead, we the people should be in those office buildings.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  We should be at those hearing meetings.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  Everyone should take their vacation every year in D.C.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  And instead of just drinking a bunch of alcohol
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  and eating a bunch of food,
[04:21.000 --> 04:26.000]  going and confronting these people is much more fulfilling.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  And it's very, very powerful.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  I mean, you just walk right up to Sundar Pachai of Google
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  and get right in his stinking ugly lion face.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  And he craps his little britches
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  and scream at him, you're a traitor.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  Get that on the wrong country, you're going down.
[04:41.000 --> 04:43.000]  I was less than a year ago, you know,
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  so you've been getting down.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  It's called expressing your will.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Standing against the enemy, putting yourself physically there
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  and doing simple little things like that
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  to bring down the system.
[04:54.000 --> 05:23.000]  I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  Health is a healthy blood cells,
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  essential for proper nervous system functioning.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  It goes on and on.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia,
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.000]  fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression,
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems,
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  and low sperm count.
[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  It helps on the infowar.
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  So it's a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  or so while supplies last.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  The price is powerful. Half the price.
[05:54.000 --> 06:23.000]  It's a 30% off right now at infowarstore.com.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  You can feel it from my heart.
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  From this time forward.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  From here on after.
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  Let's stay the way we are right now.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  And share all the love and laughter
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.000]  that a lifetime will allow.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  At the bottom of the hour,
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  I cross my heart.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  I'm going to play a new compilation
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  of the left celebrating killing little babies,
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  calling them horrible names and reveling in their death,
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  reveling in their chance to live a life
[07:01.000 --> 07:06.000]  and struggle and succeed and lose
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  and build and create an experience
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  that couldn't be a more selfish,
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  truly wicked thing to do
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  except celebrate it.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  But if you're going to go to hell,
[07:20.000 --> 07:23.000]  you might as well be first in line, huh?
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  You might as well just fully commit to it
[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  and wallow in it.
[07:28.000 --> 07:34.000]  Wallow in the spiritual filth and stench.
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.000]  You know, I don't like to cover things like this here on air.
[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  I know the show in many ways would be more popular.
[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  If I came on here and made fun of AOC
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  Ilhan Omar and the usual suspects
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  and Rebels in John Bolton
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  being removed and winning the special election
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  and the Carolinas yesterday.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  And all of that's important.
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  There's a lot of good things happening in this world.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  But you know, if we would just come to grips with it
[08:13.000 --> 08:19.000]  and recognize that we're really facing classical evil,
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  the stuff you read about in history books,
[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  the stuff you hear about in fairy tales,
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  the stuff of nightmares is our own spirit,
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  our own subconscious, our own past,
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  our own history, our own guts
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  warning us of what there is in this universe
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  that's not good and the fact that we need
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  to make the conscious decision to reject it.
[08:41.000 --> 08:47.000]  And it's that decision that is infinitely
[08:47.000 --> 08:56.000]  beyond infinity, eternally more important
[08:56.000 --> 09:03.000]  than any physical wealth, any physical health,
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  any accolades that you could ever receive.
[09:08.000 --> 09:17.000]  Nothing in this world will satisfy you except the spiritual.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  That's why the globalists try to always keep people
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  in a starvation mode so they're fighting
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  just to be able to live
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  so that they're kept at that level of base survival
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  so they never experience the success
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  of being able to have a quiet moment to reflect on eternity.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  They keep us running on that hamster or rat wheel
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  so distracted that by the time we die,
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  we never really experience life
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  and never touch the face of God
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  to make that eternal decision to go with God
[09:50.000 --> 09:59.000]  instead of go with everything that's fallen for eternity.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  We've got a lot of guests today, we've got a lot of news,
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  but at the bottom of the hour,
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  we're going to play this compilation
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  and then tomorrow we'll have even more.
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  I mean, there's hours of this.
[10:11.000 --> 10:15.000]  I mean, I knew the Left celebrated abortion,
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  but I don't try to go around looking for it.
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  It's just all over the place.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  And then once I ask the crew to look into it,
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  it's just worse than I even knew.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  And of course, isn't it always worse than you know?
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  This disease has been rotting behind the scenes
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.000]  right beneath the surface for a while.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  And now it's coming out.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  And so that's really a good thing
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  that we're going to get this thing out in the open
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  so we can tackle it.
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  It's critical that we don't become overwhelmed by it
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  and give up and hot our head in the sand.
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  I mean, it's good to pull away from the big cities,
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  pull away from the Left
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  and where their strongholds are
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  and go build our own strongholds.
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  But we have to go inner into their strongholds
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  on sorties politically,
[11:03.000 --> 11:07.000]  and we have to strafe them with the truth
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  and with justice and with liberty, never physically.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  And that's really what we are is a mission in to this.
[11:17.000 --> 11:21.000]  I mean, I was born in Texas, been in Austin since high school.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  It was not the feted LA toilet that it is now,
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  both literally and spiritually.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  But that's why we're here.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  And that's why you are where you're at.
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  But I just have to tell you that
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  the abominations going on,
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  the genetic engineering that they admit is happening now
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  is just totally dangerous, totally insane,
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  and creates so many issues like,
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  do these humanoids have rights?
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Who really controls them?
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.000]  What were they programmed to do?
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  I remember here, 20-something years ago,
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  they had been cloning people since the 60s,
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  and I went and looked it up and actually found
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  it was in mainline literature.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  Hell, I got a Timelife magazine.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  I bought it some old magazine shop.
[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  When I was out in Seattle, I haven't even shown this on air yet.
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  And it showed test tubes with human embryos in them
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  that had been engineered in the 60s.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  So they kind of told us about it then,
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  but people got upset, so they pulled back and said,
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  oh, that's just fiction.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  Imagine where they are now.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  I mean, look at these headlines right here.
[12:30.000 --> 12:34.000]  Scientists create a device that can mass produce human embryos.
[12:34.000 --> 12:37.000]  And you go in and read into it from NPR.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  Many of them are, really aren't humans.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  They're splices of 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 100 people.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  Chinese scientists edit DNA in an attempt
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  to cure man's cancer, HIV.
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  Boy, what could give rise out of that?
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  That's out of Yahoo Finance.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  Next generation of aircraft will track your bathroom visits.
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  Isn't that great?
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  There's no such thing as anonymity.
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  With consumer DNA tests, sperm banks
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  reconsider long-held promise to donors.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  Everything's about breaking promise.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  Does the new iPhone creep you out?
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  Scientists grapple with tiny holes, scare some people.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  Yeah, it's got like a little robot.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  See, now the robot's got two eyes on each side
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  and little microphones.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  And you can't turn it off.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  And Google Nest had a hidden microphone.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  And they admit they're always listening.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  Of course they are.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  It's all a race, militarily, to dominate and control you
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  and make you as mentally ill and as broken as possible
[13:38.000 --> 13:39.000]  so they can program you.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  I mean, they admit that.
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  Mosquito trials raise hopes of the name fever cure.
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  I'll tell you about that.
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  And all this ties together.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  We're going to have live coverage tonight, right through now,
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  until 11 o'clock this evening.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  Houston, we have a problem.
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  The clown world third round of debates this time,
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  all 10 on one stage.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  Elizabeth Warren will attack dog, the reanimated corpse
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  that is jibidin' with his bloody eyes and his strokes
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  and his stumbling and bumbling, the Democrats now say
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  he needs to step down.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  Where'd you hear that first?
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  So that's all coming up.
[14:22.000 --> 14:23.000]  Texas Showdown.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  Warren's new target.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  Tan, Biden, Hang on.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  Drubsreport.com.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  That's all coming up.
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  And then we are going to get into so much more here today.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  India set to carry out biggest war games near China border.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  Told you the whole cashmere thing is about proxy war with China.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  Pinsir movement.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  We're going to tie it into a whole cornucopia
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  and a large spectrum of news and information today,
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  as best I possibly can.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  First off, we're also going to come back
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  and get into right wingers.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  Are America's deadliest terrorists?
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  We got a CNN clip that went up on infowars.com
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  yesterday last night.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  We're going to cover coming up where CNN puts up
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  all these fake ravages and says white men are the terrorists
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  when statistically it's not even true.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  But regardless, the fact is they're trying to say that
[15:14.000 --> 15:23.000]  while the New York Times came out and said airplanes
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  attacked us on 9-11.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  Now, obviously the official story has got big problems
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  and there was a lot more going on there.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  But Islamic terror is real.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  There were people that were trying to do it.
[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  There were probably decoys.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  But Islamic terror is a real thing.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  To say it was airplanes is like when they said
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  there was a truck attack.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  Remember, killed hundreds of people or whatever in France?
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  They had a bunch of attacks.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  One ran over several hundred, killed a hundred plus.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  And remember, they said a truck attack people.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  No, this isn't Christine or this isn't Max from Overdrive.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  This isn't Hollywood.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  It wasn't the cars.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  It wasn't a Google self-driving car.
[15:56.000 --> 16:06.000]  It wasn't Johnny.
[16:27.000 --> 16:40.000]  In the past,

[20:29.080 --> 20:40.440]  ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide and we're gonna
[20:40.440 --> 20:45.160]  be here till at least 11 p.m. tonight and the first two debates were
[20:45.160 --> 20:50.960]  incredibly boring and incredibly stupid and unbelievably frightening how they
[20:50.960 --> 20:55.080]  all were trying to double down offering free stuff trying to go left of mouse
[20:55.080 --> 20:59.520]  a tongue now that said they were so boring and horrible they were riveting
[20:59.520 --> 21:04.360]  but at the same time it was very scary to look at Cory Booker and his fake smile
[21:04.360 --> 21:09.640]  and always looking like he's trying to you know use the bathroom when he's been
[21:09.640 --> 21:14.160]  constipated for six months and then Elizabeth Warren looks like a weird
[21:14.160 --> 21:19.800]  meth addicted piranha with her eyes just bugging out of her head with hate and
[21:19.800 --> 21:25.640]  then you look at Bernie Sanders a 78-year-old communist that swindled
[21:25.640 --> 21:30.840]  colleges and ran all sorts of criminal operations and love the Soviet Union up
[21:30.840 --> 21:35.040]  there promising people stuff and then the New York Times is praising mouse a
[21:35.040 --> 21:42.400]  tongue saying he was a great leader and AP is praising Robert Mugabe who was
[21:42.400 --> 21:48.320]  like an African Hitler said that white should all be exterminated I mean it's
[21:48.320 --> 21:54.760]  crazy but that's mainstream media folks they support killing babies after
[21:54.760 --> 21:59.720]  they're born they support breaking up the family they support saying don't say
[21:59.720 --> 22:07.960]  mother and father in elementary school entrance forms they are destroying all
[22:07.960 --> 22:15.440]  of civilization in a total takeover it's their mission it's what they've been
[22:15.440 --> 22:19.720]  financed to do you can look at it temporarily and say well the chai comms
[22:19.720 --> 22:24.040]  see us as their out as their main rival they want to demoralize us they want to
[22:24.040 --> 22:27.800]  break us down the left wants to do that to further conquer us culturally so
[22:27.800 --> 22:31.560]  they're allied and Islam wants to take over the West so they're allied with it
[22:31.560 --> 22:37.560]  what a combination the leftist Hollywood with the chai comms and the
[22:37.560 --> 22:47.840]  unelected EU with Islam and that's the big evil axis against what's left of
[22:47.840 --> 22:53.800]  Christianity what's left of free market capitalism and the Renaissance it's
[22:53.800 --> 23:00.720]  unbelievable to see these global global these global corporates doing the math
[23:00.720 --> 23:05.560]  doing the numbers there's 1.8 million Muslims there's a billion 400 million
[23:05.560 --> 23:07.960]  Chinese
[23:09.400 --> 23:17.680]  Europe's in decline the population's capitulated America is in moral decline
[23:17.680 --> 23:22.120]  we don't have a Christian culture on average anymore we don't we don't have a
[23:22.120 --> 23:26.480]  red white and blue culture we don't believe in ourselves anymore I see
[23:26.480 --> 23:29.920]  articles all over the place where the American flag people were American flag
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.480]  shirts and they're told to take them off at football games not just the Betsy
[23:34.480 --> 23:42.160]  Ross but the Gadsden flag the 50-star flag the modern flag the night circuit
[23:42.160 --> 23:47.480]  ruled six years ago that you can't wear an American flag in public schools or
[23:47.480 --> 23:55.120]  colleges in 11 states that the night circuit covers
[23:57.160 --> 24:00.860]  I'm going from memory look how many states that night is it is it nine states
[24:00.860 --> 24:03.840]  or 10 states last time I looked I was amazed it was so many states I think
[24:03.840 --> 24:10.480]  it's 11 maybe I'm right is it 9 or 10 please look that up for me and you know
[24:10.480 --> 24:13.920]  you sit back and you see that when people fall suits in colleges and in
[24:13.920 --> 24:18.680]  high school they wear an American flag and people say we're offended and they
[24:18.680 --> 24:22.480]  get kicked out of school for refusing to take it off and then the court said you
[24:22.480 --> 24:28.760]  don't wear that that's beyond the Soviet Union that's how far we've gone into
[24:28.760 --> 24:40.720]  this cult now there it is one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
[24:40.720 --> 24:51.800]  eleven twelve thirteen gosh it's even more than I thought 13 states cheese 13
[24:51.800 --> 24:57.400]  states you can't wear an American flag in school if somebody doesn't like it
[24:57.400 --> 25:01.760]  let that sink in I'm gonna stop right there I've got stacks of news here we're
[25:01.760 --> 25:07.800]  gonna hit it all but yesterday in the first hour at the end of the hour I
[25:07.800 --> 25:15.320]  came on air and told the truth I mean it's a possible future that in the next
[25:15.320 --> 25:22.080]  year and a quarter or so in four wars will run out of money to operate we can
[25:22.080 --> 25:25.480]  make it through the election maybe that's just God's will I know I've got
[25:25.480 --> 25:29.520]  enough product that if I sell it all I could run this place at full throttle
[25:29.520 --> 25:34.760]  and even expanse time into the campaign and I have a reporters on the ground for
[25:34.760 --> 25:38.960]  almost every major event and and really have a big strong powerful finish for
[25:38.960 --> 25:42.560]  info wars and then the site would still be there and I'd probably still do a
[25:42.560 --> 25:46.640]  show but it'd be probably radio or you know something like that because you
[25:46.640 --> 25:49.640]  build something up this big that's designed to reach hundreds of millions of
[25:49.640 --> 25:54.840]  people and they cut it down they cripple it they crush it and it's just hard to
[25:54.840 --> 25:59.280]  keep together and and you know I told the truth about that because listeners
[25:59.280 --> 26:03.600]  need to understand that we need to be here to put out truthful talking points
[26:03.600 --> 26:06.560]  against the globalist we need to be here to promote Americana and expose
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.760]  globalism because almost no one else really gets it like our guests do you
[26:11.760 --> 26:18.480]  do the listeners and I do now I believe by telling you that that after these
[26:18.480 --> 26:24.280]  years of boycotts and blackballing and attacks and harassment that we've held
[26:24.280 --> 26:29.760]  up much longer than they thought but that without sustained financial support
[26:29.760 --> 26:35.160]  and also spreading the word aggressively info wars that is seen as a symbol of the
[26:35.160 --> 26:39.360]  American resistance as pure Americana by the enemy they admit that they marvel
[26:39.360 --> 26:43.360]  at what we've done their white papers have leaked out of Congress the New
[26:43.360 --> 26:47.360]  York Times Washington Post I mean they are scared to death of what info wars

[33:34.600 --> 33:37.680]  Alex Jones
[33:40.920 --> 33:45.600]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're back live they are dumping out the video
[33:45.600 --> 33:49.800]  we ready next segment that has a whole bunch of new clips that I've never seen
[33:49.800 --> 33:56.040]  you may have seen these of Democrats and leftist saying we love to kill babies
[33:56.040 --> 33:59.880]  it's so enjoyable those little bastards we're gonna dig it out of there there's
[33:59.880 --> 34:06.580]  too many humans you're gonna see mainline feminist saying this can you
[34:06.580 --> 34:11.720]  imagine being married to one of these people you imagine somebody like this
[34:11.720 --> 34:17.960]  watching your back you imagine being in business with someone this nasty and
[34:17.960 --> 34:22.560]  crazed I mean these are like Charlie Manson people that cut the baby out of
[34:22.560 --> 34:38.200]  share and tape but see that was 50 years ago I guess exactly 50 years ago so
[34:38.200 --> 34:44.320]  that's that's 50 years ago and then look at who we are 50 years later
[34:44.320 --> 34:48.920]  Charlie Manson doesn't scare anybody you know AOC came out and said that
[34:48.920 --> 34:53.960]  Republicans are scared of her and that the Democrats are pathetic it don't
[34:53.960 --> 34:59.120]  recognize how wonderful their communism is and you know it's really true I am
[34:59.120 --> 35:07.400]  scared that a stupid method I mean she's obviously on stimulants who behaves
[35:07.400 --> 35:14.080]  and acts like a arrogant crack whore is up there spouting all this hate and
[35:14.080 --> 35:20.520]  saying cauliflower's racist and white people are inherently evil the woman is
[35:20.520 --> 35:25.600]  a pig I mean as you have a white person was saying crap like this I'd say they
[35:25.600 --> 35:33.480]  were a pig and then she just sits there like she's God and that's what the
[35:33.480 --> 35:37.640]  comments on info wars when we'll scare you right lady oh you're moron hey you
[35:37.640 --> 35:41.760]  know what listeners you better be scared of her you better be scared that we're
[35:41.760 --> 35:45.040]  not doing enough to educate people because while you're busy working your
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.000]  job and while you're busy running your own life the left's got your kids and
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.240]  they've got your church and they've got the media and they've got it all and
[35:52.240 --> 36:00.600]  they're sabotaging civilization and so you laugh at her when she says cauliflower
[36:00.600 --> 36:07.840]  is racist or when Burger King takes the word hamburger out because it might
[36:07.840 --> 36:13.760]  offend Muslims you laugh at that it's not funny they're destroying language on
[36:13.760 --> 36:20.920]  purpose you know limbaugh always make fun of environmentalist wackos they're
[36:20.920 --> 36:27.840]  not wackos they get control of all the carbon on this planet and track every
[36:27.840 --> 36:31.920]  bit of it and surveil it that's big brother and then if they can tax it they
[36:31.920 --> 36:38.320]  can literally impoverish whole nations selectively you don't need a bunch of
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.000]  bombers to blow up their power plants you just shut them down and Europe and
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.760]  the US had been crippled by what is it in Europe of the US over 3,000 coal
[36:46.760 --> 36:53.120]  reactors been shut down the last decade clean coal reactors China build something
[36:53.120 --> 37:02.440]  like 30 a week or something it's ridiculous we close them every week incredible
[37:02.440 --> 37:08.840]  number I've seen that they open 30 coal power plants some weeks look it up like
[37:08.840 --> 37:15.800]  I said the night district had 11 or 12 states I'm sorry that's 13 this stuff is
[37:15.800 --> 37:20.560]  insane how militarily we're under attack my god you turn on Netflix it's
[37:20.560 --> 37:25.800]  scientific warfare to destroy a country and then you read the white papers they
[37:25.800 --> 37:32.880]  say they're doing it and Congress won't act to stop Google that's moved to China
[37:32.880 --> 37:38.360]  it's delisting everyone it started with me now it's everybody I should care less
[37:38.360 --> 37:44.840]  about me but I sure as hell cannot sit here and stand by while they do this to
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.000]  everybody and it scares the hell out of me that we've got their number we know
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.120]  how to beat the globalist we know their plans I've actually read their white
[37:52.120 --> 37:54.920]  papers their books
[37:57.720 --> 38:00.880]  and that's why they want me off here because I really know what they're up
[38:00.880 --> 38:04.960]  to a lot of experts want to sit back and be glad they're the only person that
[38:04.960 --> 38:11.680]  knows it I'm freaked out that millions of Americans know what's going on I know
[38:11.680 --> 38:16.400]  because hundreds of old-timers told me all this stuff and they were dead on
[38:16.400 --> 38:22.520]  dead on I just popularized the American resistance that was right under the
[38:22.520 --> 38:26.520]  surface because you were already out there and you supported us and you put
[38:26.520 --> 38:30.840]  up with my crap a lot of the time because you knew I meant well and I was
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.920]  under stress and that nobody else was doing it at this level and I see Tucker
[38:35.920 --> 38:39.680]  Carlson starting to get it and drudge report getting it for a long time and I
[38:39.680 --> 38:43.640]  see Limbaugh adopting our talking points that's why media matters and Soros
[38:43.640 --> 38:46.760]  and the Democrats have gone after us because they have found all the instances
[38:46.760 --> 38:50.720]  and they know for a fact that Congress at lunch listens to the show and the
[38:50.720 --> 38:53.920]  White House listens to the show that's why we've got to stay on air folks
[38:53.920 --> 39:01.520]  because they are listening and I've got to stay robust and strong because they
[39:01.520 --> 39:06.160]  plan to bankrupt me and then they plan to criminally set me up when I can't
[39:06.160 --> 39:12.160]  defend myself and put me in prison they're following a formula then they
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.840]  want to kill me in prison and I'm not a victim I'm telling I'm not a bro they
[39:16.840 --> 39:24.200]  want to get me I expect all this but I don't want them to win I've got their
[39:24.200 --> 39:30.160]  tentacles wrapped all around my neck and I got their little leeches chewing all
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.000]  over me and I don't mind that it actually feels good because I want to be in
[39:34.000 --> 39:37.160]  the fight because while they're all wrapped around me I'm just stabbing
[39:37.160 --> 39:42.760]  them and stabbing them politically just running the knife in and I can feel
[39:42.760 --> 39:45.560]  them on biting into me politically and then letting go and they're in pain and
[39:45.560 --> 39:51.360]  biting again so let me tell you I mean I believe me I want to stay in this fight
[39:51.360 --> 39:56.920]  I want to defeat these people when I watch these women start having orgasms
[39:56.920 --> 39:59.280]  when they talk about killing babies we're gonna play video women like
[39:59.280 --> 40:04.440]  literally rubbing the laser I mean that is demon possession ladies and
[40:04.440 --> 40:09.920]  gentlemen this once people don't have God they're giving over to great
[40:09.920 --> 40:13.320]  delusion God turns you loose and you go what's wrong with these people
[40:13.320 --> 40:18.520]  overnight men and women become basically men become super lazy and stupid
[40:18.520 --> 40:24.160]  women become satanic and turn against their very nature of being mothers and
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.040]  loving and good and it's getting worse and worse and worse and the new fetish
[40:28.040 --> 40:34.520]  ABC News reports is abortion addiction the power to kill your baby the
[40:34.520 --> 40:38.880]  salivation and women saying they have orgasms while they murder their babies
[40:38.880 --> 40:43.280]  and they sycophantically talk about how it's gonna be so much fun oh I've got a
[40:43.280 --> 40:48.000]  little girl she's six months old I'm gonna take pictures with her chopped up
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.760]  body these are real quotes you think well this isn't a real person and then
[40:52.760 --> 40:56.760]  you go find out it's real and then you go out to an abortion clinic to
[40:56.760 --> 41:01.760]  demonstrate and Antifa shows up with their mask off and start putting black
[41:01.760 --> 41:07.080]  in front of your camera ugly tar paper it's like only a demon would just that
[41:07.080 --> 41:11.800]  and the way they walk and move is all satanic it's all just they're totally
[41:11.800 --> 41:15.320]  under its control and they just look at you they go I've killed body of my
[41:15.320 --> 41:19.320]  children and then I've talked to people that actually knows you want to go no
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.040]  that's what they do and they just they go and they look at the dead baby they
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.800]  go they spit on you little bastard you little effort they slap their baby in
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.760]  the face and then they go have sex with her car I mean these people are out of
[41:32.760 --> 41:40.440]  hell and I'm not gonna put up with their crap anymore they go and they they
[41:40.440 --> 41:46.040]  piss on their babies and God sees that you know why they're doing this they
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.400]  want God to destroy us they want God to lift the hedge so everything collapses
[41:50.400 --> 41:54.240]  they have a big free-for-all they're trying to get us to give up on God and
[41:54.240 --> 42:00.040]  not pray because soon as we do the hedge goes the head is already going down

[46:06.760 --> 46:11.320]  makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the fire department
[46:11.320 --> 46:17.240]  of New York and major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm
[46:17.240 --> 46:24.080]  that bombs were in tower one tower two and of course building seven and that
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.520]  then FBI director Robert Muller helped cover the whole thing up with the
[46:28.520 --> 46:33.800]  Saudis and to know that there's a deep state group working within our
[46:33.800 --> 46:38.360]  government with radical Islam who are using the threat of Islamic terror to
[46:38.360 --> 46:42.360]  take our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering and funding radical
[46:42.360 --> 46:46.360]  Islam to take over the planet well 18 years later I'm here to tell you that
[46:46.360 --> 46:50.760]  the world is a way to the 9-11 and info wars and our researchers and our guests
[46:50.760 --> 46:55.040]  our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again that's why info wars.com is
[46:55.040 --> 46:57.840]  more important than ever
[46:57.840 --> 47:14.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:14.800 --> 47:27.600]  the angel of death is coming for the left we don't need to go out punch him in
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.200]  the face or shoot him but we don't need offensive violence they're dying
[47:31.200 --> 47:37.600]  they're falling apart their minds are disintegrating their selfishness is
[47:37.600 --> 47:41.560]  killing them look at all the studies you don't need to study for this spending
[47:41.560 --> 47:46.440]  time with friends every day may lower dementia risk study finds the average
[47:46.440 --> 47:51.120]  leftist is incredibly alone doesn't have any real friends only goes out to meet
[47:51.120 --> 47:56.000]  like-minded people directed by Facebook or Twitter to carry out their evil
[47:56.000 --> 48:04.440]  operations and if you look at history every culture again from the ancient
[48:04.440 --> 48:10.960]  Mesoamericans to the ancient Europeans to ancient people in Asia or Africa every
[48:10.960 --> 48:15.280]  culture would decline once a priest class got in control for usually a few
[48:15.280 --> 48:21.440]  hundred years they would start demanding human sacrifice of children every
[48:21.440 --> 48:25.320]  history books fall of it the Roman histories the Jewish histories the
[48:25.320 --> 48:31.440]  Bible and they dig up these mass graves of sacrifices all over Europe all over
[48:31.440 --> 48:35.840]  Mexico all over Guatemala all over Peru
[48:35.840 --> 48:42.280]  they found hundreds of thousands of little bundled babies at cenotes in
[48:42.280 --> 48:48.960]  Mexico where they would sacrifice children to the water god now what's
[48:48.960 --> 48:56.080]  making people do this why does it keep manifesting well it's manifesting again
[48:56.080 --> 49:02.680]  you can debate all day long why it's happening where it's going so yesterday
[49:02.680 --> 49:06.240]  I said hey go grab a few more clips I've seen a bunch of clips where women say
[49:06.240 --> 49:11.840]  kill babies up to age three you know there's too many people so we found 50
[49:11.840 --> 49:15.880]  more clips probably so I asked the crew to put some of these clips into that
[49:15.880 --> 49:19.440]  four-minute report we've done with the media promoting abortion and making
[49:19.440 --> 49:22.800]  jokes about it with some new clips so some of this you've seen some of this
[49:22.800 --> 49:26.800]  you may not have seen but this is like a seven and a half minute compilation
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.320]  that it ends with Paul reading off official Twitter accounts people saying
[49:31.320 --> 49:34.320]  let's abort more babies for the earth you see the news they don't have babies
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.920]  save the earth they're selling the idea that humans are inherently bad and
[49:37.920 --> 49:42.000]  they're really selling us on not having any value for ourselves well now they
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.160]  euthanized a 46 year old man because he didn't have any health care and he was
[49:47.160 --> 49:51.520]  fully conscious begging for help in Canada last week so that's where this
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.240]  is going here is this compilation that needs to get out to everybody will
[49:56.240 --> 50:03.680]  post it to info wars.com and News Wars.com later here it is concerns breast implants
[50:03.680 --> 50:07.640]  at some are against them others believe they're fine in rare cases and many
[50:07.640 --> 50:12.200]  believe you should be able to get them whenever the fuck you want sorry did I
[50:12.200 --> 50:28.280]  say breast implants I meant abortions tonight's main topic concerns abortion
[50:28.280 --> 50:34.520]  get out of my behind get out of my vagina it's a woman's body and she should
[50:34.520 --> 50:38.240]  not be forced to carry anything inside of it wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.360]  sit at the heartbeat so you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm a fetus is a
[50:43.360 --> 50:51.320]  parasite sweetie you think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's
[50:51.320 --> 51:00.320]  problems right how many did I adopt I kill my kids you've got amazing grace
[51:00.320 --> 51:03.920]  being sung I don't know they am radio picks it up but they're saying hail
[51:03.920 --> 51:09.000]  satan and the news confirmed that's what they're saying
[51:09.160 --> 51:12.560]  there she is hail satan sticks her tongue out you got a repentance there
[51:12.560 --> 51:20.440]  for murdering babies why because it's a sin before God why wow stinky breath

[52:01.720 --> 52:31.680]  you kill them you let them
[52:31.680 --> 52:40.480]  listen they can start to down why do you spit at us no right to talk about it
[52:40.480 --> 52:45.720]  understand me mother so when do we cut off abortions at what week I think at
[52:45.720 --> 52:50.960]  three years old I also had my first abortion at the Seattle plant
[52:50.960 --> 53:05.120]  on the topic on the field tissue side of it you know it'd be helpful for us to
[53:05.120 --> 53:09.640]  understand volume wise I mean realistically if we were to do an
[53:09.640 --> 53:13.240]  agreement with you guys you know what do we think you could get and what do you
[53:13.240 --> 53:17.240]  feel like you could get volume wise yeah on specifically liver tissue because
[53:17.240 --> 53:23.000]  that's such an area of demand for us right so liver and what about intact
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.480]  just oh yeah I mean if you had intact cases which we've we've done a lot so
[53:28.480 --> 53:31.560]  we've sometimes shipped those back to our lab and it's a higher you know you can
[53:31.560 --> 53:34.680]  imagine where they would run with this like they're selling for you know so I
[53:34.680 --> 53:39.000]  say okay what are your what are you looking to supply today we're asked to
[53:39.000 --> 53:47.960]  procure certain tissues like brain, liver, thymus, pancreas, heart, lungs, skin pretty
[53:47.960 --> 53:56.200]  much anything on the fetus if we alter our process and we are able to obtain
[53:56.200 --> 54:02.840]  intact fetal cadavers it's all just a matter of line items tell the lab it's
[54:02.840 --> 54:12.120]  coming and are we agreed that a hundred dollars would keep you happy
[54:15.200 --> 54:22.120]  the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the
[54:22.120 --> 54:27.880]  mother just prior to the birth of the baby now you can say that that's okay
[54:27.880 --> 54:33.400]  and Hillary can say that that's okay but it's not okay with me well that is not
[54:33.400 --> 54:38.680]  what happens in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just
[54:38.680 --> 54:43.000]  terribly unfortunate New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up the one-world trade
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.920]  center Spire and Pink to celebrate his erotical expansion of abortion in New
[54:47.920 --> 54:52.400]  York state lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion in the state for any
[54:52.400 --> 54:57.600]  reason until a 24th week of pregnancy and then up until birth if a mother is in
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.600]  labor I can tell you exactly what would happen the infant would be delivered the
[55:02.600 --> 55:07.240]  infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that's
[55:07.240 --> 55:11.840]  what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between
[55:11.840 --> 55:19.920]  the physicians and the mother are you for third trimester abortions my answer
[55:19.920 --> 55:24.360]  to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes
[55:24.360 --> 55:29.800]  there's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very
[55:29.800 --> 55:34.160]  difficult is it okay to still have children how do you justify the
[55:34.160 --> 55:39.480]  decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free
[55:39.480 --> 55:46.280]  next speaker there's a new video out on infowars.com of two partial birth
[55:46.280 --> 55:52.320]  abortion eight and a half month old babies and and it makes you want to kill
[55:52.320 --> 55:58.160]  people I'm just be honest with you right now my guts my spirit sees a baby
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.440]  who had got killed and its brain sucked out by some asshole and then they make
[56:03.440 --> 56:08.680]  a joke out of it these are abortion doctors with third trimester babies that
[56:08.680 --> 56:12.440]  were about to be born the filing them being jokes about them that they're
[56:12.440 --> 56:19.280]  having a fight they're playing with dead babies in a in a little medical pan
[56:19.280 --> 56:23.720]  and it was pretty shocking through some stuff to see and just total lack of
[56:23.720 --> 56:28.720]  regard for humanity that's just absolutely amazing we're gonna have
[56:28.720 --> 56:32.960]  Debbie Johnson I'm sorry
[56:37.880 --> 56:44.320]  don't knock it till you try it and when you do try it really knock it you know
[56:44.320 --> 56:51.520]  you gotta get that baby out of there question regarding abortions and
[56:51.520 --> 56:56.000]  breeding fetish I have a female friend who has a really powerful fetish for
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.960]  breeding she has never used any type of birth control she is with a male
[56:59.960 --> 57:03.640]  partner currently who is just like her into breeding and they've been
[57:03.640 --> 57:07.800]  practicing their fetish for quite a few abortions I know this fetish my
[57:07.800 --> 57:11.560]  girlfriend and me have the same fetish my girlfriend enjoy her pregnancies and
[57:11.560 --> 57:17.040]  she enjoys the abortion to tie on her preferred date for the abort is between
[57:17.040 --> 57:21.960]  20 and 24 weeks of gestation I enjoy it to make her pregnant and I enjoy the
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.480]  time of her pregnancy she has no menstrual period and she is sexual very
[57:26.480 --> 57:31.960]  active sexuality without prevention is very emotional and inexpensive in the
[57:31.960 --> 57:36.640]  last 10 years in our relationship we have done seven abortions and my girlfriend
[57:36.640 --> 57:40.960]  is pregnant again with a little girl abortion fetish is a great method for
[57:40.960 --> 57:44.920]  birth control do not be angry about your girlfriend but let them enjoy their
[57:44.920 --> 57:50.320]  pregnancy this is what a baby looks like I was among the first 12 years ago to
[57:50.320 --> 57:55.320]  warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using
[57:55.320 --> 58:00.600]  pedophilia I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ
[58:00.600 --> 58:04.760]  harvesting I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive
[58:04.760 --> 58:09.880]  after they were born for their organs to be harvested I was the first to warn you
[58:09.880 --> 58:14.800]  along with Paul Watson at info wars.com 15 years ago that Google was using
[58:14.800 --> 58:19.160]  microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and
[58:19.160 --> 58:24.520]  hundreds of other giant issues like the Federal Reserve being private run for
[58:24.520 --> 58:28.480]  profit trying to control our economy that our government in Hollywood have been
[58:28.480 --> 58:32.520]  taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many

[1:00:06.320 --> 1:00:11.400]  Houston we have a problem found world that's the third round this night it's
[1:00:11.400 --> 1:00:16.120]  only one night one night 10 candidates and tons of laughs so you realize how
[1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:22.040]  dangerous they are who they work for that is coming up right now we're in live
[1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:25.680]  coverage but we're gonna be here right through 11 o'clock tonight the debate
[1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:30.400]  goes from 7 until close to 10 o'clock and we're gonna open the phones up this
[1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:37.960]  evening and we are going to again have coverage that officially is already
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:43.000]  kicked off but we'll be live right after the war room at 6 I'll be here
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:47.200]  Robert Barnes is gonna be here of course we're gonna have Will Johnson on

[1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:57.360]  really am gonna be good because I'm the worst person around here about getting
[1:00:57.360 --> 1:01:00.080]  fired up and wanting to make every point I'm gonna write notes not interrupt as
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:05.120]  much and I'm gonna again work in a lot of your calls that'll be obviously
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:09.640]  waiting and then my I guess when I kind of direct this when I choose that we've
[1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:13.120]  already heard this answer over and over again it's a mindless point will will
[1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:18.760]  fade down the dumbbell and take a call or so but this is gonna be a blood bath
[1:01:18.760 --> 1:01:24.440]  and obviously we're gonna be going heavily to a political blood bath so we
[1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:27.480]  try to say we're being violent that's a figure of speech a metaphor I know our
[1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:31.360]  audience knows that but the left will take out a context we're obviously when
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:37.320]  Elizabeth Warren's talking she's been going after old bloody eyes old old
[1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:42.120]  Biden so we're gonna be showing them pull their knives out or they see as the
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:46.520]  Julius Caesar that's got to be dispatched and we'll be making predictions
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:50.080]  with Robert Barnes who's been stunningly accurate owns predictions have been
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:56.960]  excellent as well but Barnes is a gambler he does sports gambling some but
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:02.440]  he mainly is political gambling and is admittedly the biggest winner in the
[1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:09.000]  2016 election just on Irish bets he made like $400,000 with a bunch of bets here
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:16.480]  and so he's gonna be handicapping this whole thing with us coming up later in
[1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:21.120]  the hour and we've got a bunch of other guests as well I am not a gambler in
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:27.640]  money or in chips or things like poker I mean I mean I have played poker games
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:32.440]  before for a few hundred bucks in the pot but I gamble my life I gamble my name
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:38.280]  my treasure my very soul and will to defeat the globlest and so all of us
[1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:41.880]  gamble you know you gamble when you decide to marry a woman you gamble when
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:46.160]  you decide to try to climb a mountain you gamble when you invest in business but
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:48.840]  as long as you're doing things for what you think's right really that's all that
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:53.240]  matters at the end of the day is is the action you take and really who you are
[1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:58.600]  the the destination is the journey ladies and gentlemen that really is so
[1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:04.520]  true so Robert Barnes coming up Brandon Tatum is with the great folks over at
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:08.480]  Turning Point USA and he's also one of the folks over there that isn't scared
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:13.000]  of the info or you know he understands that's all them trying to demonize what
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.280]  they know is effective it's always like to hear from him he's gonna pop in and
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:19.960]  then Matt Bracken is always informative he's gonna be hosting the fourth hour
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:25.120]  I'll probably host some of that with him as well today but start your engines
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:31.480]  because I'm gonna move quickly I'm gonna move quickly in the next two segments
[1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:36.080]  to hit as much news as possible and I've actually been reaching some of my goals
[1:03:36.080 --> 1:03:40.920]  to get the show back to so it's better days when we do some things better than
[1:03:40.920 --> 1:03:45.760]  we used to but other things worse a lot of that's because of me and so I'm gonna
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:49.520]  try to blitz through more news I'm gonna get into more calls more days get
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:53.720]  into more your calls still not optimum but it's way better than I was and so I
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:59.040]  really have it on my heart and my soul to just up my game and so I'm
[1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:03.800]  exercising more I'm eating healthier I'm taking the supplements and I've been
[1:04:03.800 --> 1:04:07.560]  doing that about three weeks now and it's like a fog is lifted because I give
[1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:11.160]  some great advice but it isn't easy to give advice it's easy to talk the talk
[1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:14.800]  it's hard to walk the walk but I've been doing it so thank you all for your
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:18.720]  prayers and your support and the crew putting up with me as well because
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:22.000]  sometimes we really reach the heights and sometimes I reach the depths and
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.520]  that's all part of the reality though of this real world that we're just flesh
[1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:30.240]  and blood flesh and blood needs flesh and blood that's why all the studies
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:33.840]  are out I'll hit that need friends need family need communication you're
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:37.920]  empowered by having a cat having a dog having a child they make it as hard as
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:41.440]  they can I have that dog or have that child just have people and things you
[1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:44.520]  love and things you take care of and things that take care of you it's all
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:50.120]  about love isn't it but real loves being willing to get attacked take action and
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:53.280]  go through a lot of pain for the innocence but in the end it empowers you
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:55.520]  doesn't it
[1:04:56.040 --> 1:05:02.960]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S. that has
[1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:06.360]  their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that

[1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:56.680]  so as I'm taping this September 10th
[1:05:56.680 --> 1:06:18.320]  live raw and unfiltered it's the Alex Jones show Q. D. Pie has over a hundred
[1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:23.280]  billion views last time I checked on one YouTube channel on all his platforms
[1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:28.800]  he's got about that I've looked at last time this is months ago about 150
[1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:33.160]  billion views and that's with Google always cheating you on your views and
[1:06:33.160 --> 1:06:36.680]  we get up to 3 billion views and they they downgrade 2 billion views and on
[1:06:36.680 --> 1:06:39.800]  all our channels we had about 5 billion they admitted to count all the other
[1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:44.280]  channels 10 billion views whatever number one Joe Rogan podcast ever my point
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:49.080]  is is that every time we're allowed to get on the field or let's use a NASCAR
[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:54.840]  analogy you let my team my car get on the track we have won more races
[1:06:54.840 --> 1:06:59.640]  politically we've got more checkered flags we've been popping the champagne
[1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:05.640]  more times than anybody in political media when it comes to video and audio
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:09.480]  drudges the king when it comes to the number that the amount of clicks but it's
[1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:14.720]  not about who's number one I just want to beat the globalist the tooty pie is
[1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:21.080]  something completely different he has more views than basically everyone
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:28.200]  combined period and if he ever gets political on the side of liberty it is
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:33.480]  going to destroy the globalist and that's why I have a message to tooty pie
[1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:37.920]  they're never going to let you continue to operate as a maverick and that's why
[1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:41.800]  they continue to make up that he's a white supremacist and that the and as
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:44.880]  they've done that the last few years it's gotten him more patriot more
[1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:49.000]  anti-globalist and I know all people that know him behind the scenes I'm just
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.920]  gonna leave it at that the guy is the opposite of a quote racist but he is
[1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:56.120]  Swedish that blonde hair blue eyes that's a big trigger for the left and
[1:07:56.120 --> 1:08:05.080]  again he's got more views than Netflix gets in a year I mean it's ridiculous and
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:09.440]  so they're scared of him and let me tell you every time he's plugged in for us
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:13.400]  he's done it five or six times I mean I'm like why is the website have doubled
[1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:21.520]  the traffic this week it's it's it's unbelievable so tooty pie just cuck to
[1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:24.960]  the ADL we're gonna cover that in a moment but first this is an important
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:28.840]  report I've been wanting to get to and so let's go ahead and get to this report
[1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:33.520]  democratic socialism as a cancer well yeah not that one get to that too later
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:39.360]  populism critics are professional deviance that's a great point because
[1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:44.840]  populism means the people well I mean we don't want these global populist
[1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:49.240]  members we want big billionaires and ruthless technocrats with the chai
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:53.760]  comms it tells you yay China hope you can stop Trump hope you can stop Boris
[1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:59.120]  Johnson hope you can stop Balasaro what here's a record skip so here's that
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:05.120]  report it's always the people that have less than zero room to talk that come
[1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:09.360]  barreling out of nowhere to attack President Trump with cartloads of bull
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:13.520]  whether it's Mick Jagger who recently blamed Trump for tearing apart
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:17.680]  environment controls when America should be setting the standard for the world
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:22.640]  of course his royal satanic majesty doesn't understand that those controls
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:26.720]  include something found in the fine print of the UN climate summit known as
[1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:30.960]  loss and damage where the United States and other developed countries would
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:35.280]  essentially pay up to undeveloped countries for any damage incurred by
[1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:41.040]  co2 emissions determined by UN climate scientists a quick way to spiral the
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:46.080]  United States into an economic collapse but who can expect the Satanist who made
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:51.040]  a film with Crowley acolyte Kenneth anger and future Manson murderer Bobby
[1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:56.160]  Bosellil to understand anything outside of what his social circle of vampires
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:00.560]  tells him and then there is former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford who
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:03.680]  has announced that he will run as a Republican against Trump
[1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:07.360]  Sanford went on to attack Trump for his transgressions
[1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:11.200]  while brushing aside the fact that he covered up an affair he was having
[1:10:11.200 --> 1:10:14.800]  with his Argentinian mistress by claiming he had been hiking the
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:21.680]  Appalachian Trail I developed a relationship with a
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:26.720]  started as a dear dear friend from Argentina add to this motley crew
[1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:31.760]  disgraced former Trump press secretary Anthony Scaramucci who is desperately
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:37.200]  clinging to his 15 minutes of fame he's going after individual privates of
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:41.600]  Trump is a fascist oh the first thing in the in the fascist manifesto what is
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:46.400]  that is going after private citizens using your political power here's my
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:49.680]  question to you because the minute you say something out of line
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:53.120]  do you realize you're getting used by the media by saying that and then my own
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:56.880]  MSNBC do you realize when they have you on to bash the president
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:00.240]  they're using the ashing the president we're gonna work on getting him to feed
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:03.280]  because they hate you no this is not about the media hates you but now they
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:06.880]  love you because you're hitting the press and then there's the field of
[1:11:06.880 --> 1:11:11.680]  democratic candidate madness towing the same cringeworthy attacks we have all
[1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:16.560]  grown to loathe but if Donald Trump is reelected
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:20.320]  Freudian slip as this man tries to divide us
[1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:25.360]  and demean Americans and degrade Americans and pit us against each other
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:29.920]  it is time for us it's time for us as democrats to remember
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:35.520]  who we are and what are you gonna do in the next one year
[1:11:35.520 --> 1:11:40.400]  to diminish the mentally retarded action of this time
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:47.840]  well said someone at your town hall uh that we were at yesterday um called the
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:50.720]  current president president trump mentally retarded
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:54.800]  um what do you make of that there's video on social media
[1:11:54.800 --> 1:12:00.160]  it's um an incredibly offensive term well said
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:04.160]  even the almighty king of morality and truth snopes founder
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:09.760]  david michelson allegedly embezzled 98 thousand dollars for prostitutes during
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:14.800]  his divorce i ask you has any decent persons stood up in opposition to
[1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:22.160]  president trump's populist uprising john bound reporting
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:27.200]  i wanted to play that report because you look at cori booker and camila harris
[1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:32.160]  and anthony scared of mochi and they're viciously lying about trump and his
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:35.600]  supporters and calling it fascist if trump then
[1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:39.360]  responds back and says someone's a liar i mean trump said scare of mochi only
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:43.200]  works for us 13 days he didn't do a very good job that's why we got
[1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:46.160]  rid of him and now he's trying to get attention for himself because he's a
[1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:50.720]  loser that's trump's response to just trump's a fascist he's hitler get rid
[1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:54.400]  of him he's mentally ill he hates you know everybody
[1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:58.320]  he's a racist well did you ever hear him say something racist well no
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:01.680]  and then cori booker they're trying to divide us they're trying to that's their
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:04.000]  playbook it's in the wiki leaks that hillary was
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.360]  trying to create racial division and division between men and women
[1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:11.440]  she's a ruthless pig you know all the things about hillary
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:15.120]  representing child molesters on purpose and making jokes about it
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:17.920]  and just all the things she's done overthrowing countries murdering
[1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:20.160]  millions
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:24.320]  tripling the sanctions on iraq killed a million children malin all rights when
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:26.880]  it was a half million said it was a good price to pay
[1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:30.960]  these are admissions is that it's well known it's been in the news
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:35.040]  hillary never tips and i'm just i'm just explaining
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:39.440]  studies show liberals don't tip as big as conservatives look it up
[1:13:39.440 --> 1:13:43.200]  liberals don't donate as much as conservatives liberals virtue signal
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:47.280]  though they steal more they lie more and now she
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:50.320]  goes around in art exhibits all over the world she's done in the u.s now she's
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:56.480]  doing it in italy and she poses as the president
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:03.600]  and you look at her she's a satanic zombie i'm digressing let's get back to
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:07.040]  puti pie fans curious after puti pie donates
[1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:11.040]  50 000 to the adl well arnold schwarzzenegger gave a million
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:14.960]  dollars the adl and then they stopped saying he was a nazi back in the
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:19.120]  80s you know arnold was buddies with kurt volltime an ss officer
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:23.920]  who actually rounded up jews uh and uh or he wears
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:27.600]  hitler outfits it's well known and he said he loved hitler to rolling stone
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:31.120]  quoted he bought uh the extra footage that was never
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:34.320]  aired from pumping iron because he praised hitler and pumping iron
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:38.080]  now in the extras they were going to put out nice form of extortion though the
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:41.840]  filmmakers he bought it for millions uh so he went to the adl
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:46.400]  and paid him off hoody pie they call a nazi for a reason
[1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:49.200]  because he's got a hundred and something billion views
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:52.960]  and it's growing and they're jealous so the adl is always attacking him calling
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:56.240]  for him to be taken off the internet so he gave him 50 000 dollars or started
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:14:58.960]  to and it was a big backlash adl didn't thank him
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:03.280]  and so he said screw you all take the money back a great way to chump the adl
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:07.600]  the adl with abe foxman discredited itself so bad lost a bunch of lawsuits
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:11.040]  got caught breaking into police stations to get files on people
[1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:15.040]  and the adl is the leftist group trying to use
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:18.800]  what happened to the jews in the holocaust to project it onto the american
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:21.920]  people and to make us all guilty hey we kicked
[1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:25.520]  hitler's ass adl and so you try to tell us all

[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:43.840]  i mean this is the left going pure racial politics
[1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:47.760]  to divide us while telling us that we're when we try to unify people

[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:04.160]  2019 and i look back to that tragic event
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:09.360]  18 years ago it makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:15.200]  fire department of new york and major construction and engineering firms come
[1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:19.360]  out and confirm that bombs were in tower one tower two
[1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:23.040]  and of course building seven it just pancakes and that
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:26.960]  then fbi director robert muller helped cover the whole thing up
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:30.960]  with the soddies and to know that there's a deep state group
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:34.640]  working within our government with radical islam
[1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:38.480]  who are using the threat of islamic terror to take our basic liberties and
[1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:42.720]  freedoms while empowering and funding radical islam to take over the planet
[1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:45.440]  well 18 years later i'm here to tell you that

[1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:32.400]  this transmission you are the resistance
[1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:37.520]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i almost forgot some exciting news
[1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:42.400]  i've been so focused on all the breaking news across the country from texas to
[1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:46.240]  new york to illinois to california confirming in court
[1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:51.360]  and in congress in dc that children have been kept alive illegally all of the
[1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:56.160]  world not just here and their organs are being harvested
[1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:58.960]  yes it's horrific but we knew this a long time ago
[1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:01.680]  now it's coming out and that's why the satanist and their
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:05.680]  minions are trying to really intimidate and bully everybody right now because
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:09.440]  they can feel the heat the searing light
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:14.480]  of publicity like high noon vaporizing count dracula
[1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:19.040]  now president trump tweeted paul joseph watson's great news site
[1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:23.200]  summit dot news and i was talking to paul this morning paul said yeah we've
[1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:26.720]  gotten over a million visitors from it so thanks to
[1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:31.600]  president trump ship carrying climate change warriors
[1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:37.200]  concerned about melting arctic ice get stuck in the ice
[1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:41.840]  and of course right now is the end of summer
[1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:46.000]  this is the peak time in the arctic the north pole
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:51.840]  and the northern passage and their big russian nuclear powered icebreakers
[1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:55.280]  that the west uses that russia uses uh now
[1:21:55.280 --> 1:21:58.800]  that through most the year they actually keep it open they keep open the
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:02.320]  middle of the winter if they want there's a few months they usually take off
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:07.120]  and these big giant nuclear powered evil russians uh keep that northern passage
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:11.360]  all the way around the north pole broken open well
[1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:15.520]  some leftists wanted to go stage an event because they do this every summer
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:19.520]  and they show melting glaciers collapsing at the end of summer
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:22.560]  that's why you always have had the icebergs sometimes giant ones you know
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:25.360]  the size of a city from Antarctica at the south or
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:29.040]  arctic north float sometimes there have been cases where they've seen
[1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:32.320]  them all the way up by brazil's coast from the arctic or from the
[1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:36.000]  Antarctic because it'll break off and be the size of
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:39.040]  dalish was was one they said was the size of dalish years ago
[1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:42.960]  and by the time it went a couple thousand miles north up to brazil
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:47.440]  it was still huge though a lot smaller and the media always points at it and
[1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:51.840]  says look at that look at that it's it's all
[1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:55.040]  melting well that's because the arctic and the Antarctic
[1:22:55.040 --> 1:23:00.960]  get smaller in the summer bigger in the winter now i know all of you
[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:03.920]  know that but they'll show all the time to school kids they were
[1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:07.040]  showing it you know my kid saw some tv program my
[1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:11.920]  middle daughter was asking last week she goes dad they showed a satellite
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:14.800]  because she'd heard me talk about how the ice caps are actually the biggest
[1:23:14.800 --> 1:23:17.520]  ever recorded right now which they are they've only been recording them though
[1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:21.840]  for a couple hundred years and she heard me say oh that's all
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:25.440]  bull she said but they showed it shrinking and i said honey
[1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:29.760]  that was a time lapse of the summer and i went online and showed her how they
[1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:33.520]  run the scams and it uh what's up with that and
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:38.560]  other sites or montan sites have it and it shows the ice caps getting
[1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:42.320]  smaller well they show you the ice caps getting smaller
[1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:45.680]  and of course the fall comes in winter they get bigger
[1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:49.600]  that's how that works and then at many times the northern passage gets
[1:23:49.600 --> 1:23:52.560]  completely blocked if the russians weren't going back and forth with these
[1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:56.400]  gigantic nuclear powered ice breakers uh which are amazing you know themselves
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:23:58.720]  i watched the documentary about that just a few weeks ago
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:01.840]  actually my my daughter was asking about it i went and showed her this and
[1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:05.120]  then she went what's that it was an rt show about ice breakers and
[1:24:05.120 --> 1:24:08.480]  also she got obsessed with ice breakers and next we were watching
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:14.480]  northern military convoys and the race to the arctic and the us and the russians
[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:18.320]  sending in forces the arctic and we spent like an hour at the computer
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:21.840]  watching it but i i'm digressing it is riveting stuff
[1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:25.840]  ship tearing climate change warriors concerned about melting arctic ice gets
[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:28.640]  stuck in the ice and it goes on arctic
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:35.680]  tour ship ms malmo with 16 passengers on board got stuck september 3rd
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:40.240]  and it goes on at the archipelago reports maritime bulletin the ship is on
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:42.960]  arctic tour with climate change documentary team film
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:47.200]  and tourists concern that climate change and melting ice
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:50.880]  now again the average person goes the arctic's melting it's always
[1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:54.480]  melting in the summer it's expanding in the colder months
[1:24:54.480 --> 1:24:59.600]  something's very wrong with arctic ice instead of melting as ordered by the un
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:03.440]  it captured the ship with climate change warriors
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:07.040]  so now they've got a russian icebreaker on the way
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:11.040]  at the end of summer to save them out of it because they all wanted to go here
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:14.320]  here's a shot of it they all wanted to go show this and
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:19.120]  be heroes and show you melting ice but it didn't happen
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:23.280]  it didn't happen ladies and gentlemen because the ice is thicker
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:27.200]  than it's ever been right now so there it is
[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:30.240]  trump retweeted a ship carrying passengers who introduced
[1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:33.760]  and included a group of climate change warriors who were concerned about
[1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:37.600]  melting arctic ice got stuck in the ice halfway between norway
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:44.160]  and the north pole shummit dot news so there you go we're going to go to
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:46.880]  break and we're going to have robert marins here with us we're going to cover
[1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:50.320]  the waterfront of a ton of news but first we're going to get him
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:53.840]  who he's the most successful famous sports gambler
[1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:58.320]  he is going to not sports gambler he does that too
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:02.400]  political gambler so we are teleprompter uh free here ladies gentlemen
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:06.480]  so he is going to be in studio with us coming up
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:10.240]  for the balance of the transmission including tonight because we're already
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:13.600]  two hours in or so i mean really i guess it started
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:17.840]  earlier this morning with david night so i guess we're like four five hours in
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:22.560]  to live coverage it runs right through 11 p.m tonight we'll go as long as the
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:25.760]  crew wants i'm going to be here ladies and gentlemen
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:29.840]  covering the debate live with robert marins i'm going to be here uh with
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:33.600]  our crew on the ground in houston i was thinking about going to houston myself
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:37.360]  and it would be quite an extravaganza obviously with the left freaking out
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:39.920]  having convulsions there'll be more democrat debates
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:45.040]  that i will go to um but uh i've decided to stay here just because
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:50.880]  i always go with my gut and old gutty what he said stay right here in the atx
[1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:54.560]  so i'm going to follow that directive when i was
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:56.960]  younger i never followed my gut and bad things happened
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:27:00.400]  when i just do what spirit says it's really spirit your brain your spirit
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:03.520]  connect to your gut tells you through the gut the spinal cord has
[1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:07.040]  basically continued brain tissue into it so everybody now understands you follow
[1:27:07.040 --> 1:27:09.440]  the gut that's the subconscious brain it's the
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:12.880]  main powerful system hundreds of times more powerful than your limited
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:16.720]  conscious focus so i trump's genius when he said the most
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:20.320]  deep thing i ever did was learn to be shallow
[1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:23.520]  like women's intuition it's the first approximation it's not shallow
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:28.000]  your first approximation at a gut level catches all the little manipulations
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.520]  all the fake camouflage all the dis info and then gives you that
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:34.800]  deep ancestral knowledge kind of like i was standing in my
[1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:39.600]  garage and i got this old cool african head hanging on the wall
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:43.120]  it's like a south african carved wood head i really like it but
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:46.800]  i got a dartboard on the other side and i was with pat riley we were working out
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:50.480]  my garage yesterday and i said watch this i'm just not
[1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:53.600]  gonna think about it i'm not gonna try i'm on the other end of the garage i
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:57.120]  throw the dart three car garage between the eyes
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:00.640]  of it i said watch i did it again this close
[1:28:00.640 --> 1:28:03.360]  from each other because i've got a surveillance camera on the garage i'll
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:05.600]  to pull that up i've got it for security obviously

[1:33:22.480 --> 1:33:27.440]  you're listening to alex jones the great shooter jennings
[1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:32.000]  bringing us in with summer a rage inspired by this transmission
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:36.240]  that's not bragging what's exciting is inspiring people with their art with
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:42.640]  their soul to reach out into the world and not be cookie
[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:48.000]  cutters of the globalist you know rob do was just reminding me
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.080]  about all these articles that are out and in nasa admits they're watching
[1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:55.920]  mysterious object from interstellar space approaching our solar system
[1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:03.120]  and i've forgotten about c slash 2019 q4 and some other objects
[1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:09.360]  that obviously are not organically occurring and i'm not somebody that gets
[1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:13.520]  into space aliens and things because there's never really proof
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:18.480]  this ladies and gentlemen and some of these objects are basically
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:24.400]  like canisters like long long tubes and they scan them on the radio telescopes
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:28.560]  and they've got trajectories that aren't following the way comets come in and go
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:31.280]  around the sun because they're on the trajectory they've been caught by it
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:34.000]  on an elliptical
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:37.920]  this is completely different and is traveling in and is set in just a few
[1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:42.400]  months to go by mars very close to earth
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:50.000]  so a lot of stuff going on and this is the artist rendering of it
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:56.240]  the the issue is is that they've found a bunch of these so if you're tv viewer
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:35:00.800]  you can see that it's tubular and it turns out that these
[1:35:00.800 --> 1:35:06.320]  projectiles are exactly what you would use to encase
[1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:12.000]  something it's exactly what a lot of our scientists and for 60 70 years have
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:15.360]  said they would mine asteroids carve them put an
[1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:18.400]  engine in the back and then that's how you would handle space
[1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:21.920]  impacts into the future instead of having a force field
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:24.880]  because i mean if you're going super fast anywhere near light speed or
[1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:28.000]  warping whatever they come up with which equation show they have or could
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.960]  develop you're going to deal with a lot of
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:34.400]  particular hitting and that's what's going to destroy you well
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:36.960]  you you you would build it into an asteroid
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:40.960]  so um this is uh something i meant to get to
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:43.920]  for the last year since they discovered the object
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:47.600]  what's making its approach now and so we're going to be doing more of this in
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:51.200]  the future things that we haven't gotten into so look for that
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:54.480]  um ever gotten Robert Barnes's take on on on extraterrestrial life or
[1:35:54.480 --> 1:36:00.640]  interdimensional we'll get to that too also um
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:04.720]  we're going to get into something i've been mentioning the last hour and a
[1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:09.680]  half but haven't hit yet we need to this whole lie and we have the numbers
[1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:13.600]  it's not even true i think it's a whopping lie that white men and right
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:17.520]  wingers are america's deadliest terrorist it's all how the fbi
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:21.280]  doesn't list black on white crime or islamic crime
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:24.880]  when they run somebody over in new york it's not count as terrorism
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:28.560]  show and i'm not here trying to you know keep numbers or anything just they're
[1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:32.000]  lying about this and crime statistics show that
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.040]  white males have one of the lowest crime rates out there
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:38.400]  they're not the lowest obviously women are the lowest
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:42.720]  for for physical type crime and it goes through there but it's just an
[1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:45.440]  incredible lie so we're going to go over some of that coming up
[1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:49.840]  in the next segment i i wanted now to start getting into the debate tonight
[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:53.440]  and robert barnes who is recognized with one and guardian association i mean

[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:05.280]  fake polls so we'll go to him in a moment but but please don't forget

[1:40:36.320 --> 1:40:40.000]  about 12 percent we believe he will go up over the next 10 days
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.680]  and huyan castro is trading in about half of one percent
[1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:46.560]  we expect him to rise because the debate's going to be in houston
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:50.160]  there's a univision co-component of this they're they're they actually put out a
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:54.400]  poll related to this that was promoting issues related to
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:57.840]  various immigration related issues which is castros calling card so we
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:00.720]  anticipate him doing well so that's uh we anticipate
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:04.400]  indrew yang surprising people and being the upset winner of the
[1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:07.760]  gu of the judge poll and the upset winner of the google search engines
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:11.520]  tonight the pretty the general predictions are bernie or biden or warren
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:15.600]  or harris or buddha judge uh i guess it's buddha judge i keep
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:19.360]  forgetting how to pronounce his name he's the you know useless mayor of south bend
[1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:22.800]  so you know take it as you will uh but we think yang will be probably the best
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:27.040]  person it'll be the surprise winner uh the underdog bet that's a good live dog
[1:41:27.040 --> 1:41:30.240]  you were able to predict tulsi gabbers before you were able to predict
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:33.600]  um what the polls would show this is a whole bunch of what were all those
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:35.440]  predictions because i remember it was uncanny
[1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:39.200]  so yeah previously we predicted uh gabard yang and maryon williamson in
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:42.560]  various debates winning the google search engines winning the judge polls they
[1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:46.240]  did we forecast uh in the first debate we forecast
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:50.960]  heron coming up a harris going up and uh bernie uh and biden going down that
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:54.720]  happened after the second round of debates we predicted harris going down
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:58.560]  and bernie going up that's exactly what happened so no matter which bet you took
[1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:02.720]  the google search debate the uh the judge poll debate the who
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:05.280]  was going to go up in the betting markets who was going to go down in the
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:07.440]  betting markets we predicted gabard would rise in the
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.280]  betting markets after each debate she did she people made a 50 percent profit
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:15.440]  in one night if they made that bet so the uh so it's been a very profitable
[1:42:15.440 --> 1:42:19.280]  enterprise those who have watched us to have uh discuss and forecast what was
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:23.600]  going to happen in the debates the big news tonight is can kamala harris
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:27.360]  bounce back or is she done for good uh because if she doesn't come out
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:30.800]  swinging and make another big hit like she did in the first debate she may be
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:35.040]  do a and can joe biden at least pretend he's senile for one night
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:40.560]  absolutely can he hide the senility uh the senile dribbling and uh faux pas and
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:44.480]  foot in the mouth and the rest of the train wrecks that are jib i did
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:47.520]  we'll talk more about this straight ahead and then get into this

[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:52.480]  absorbable when you inject it but that's the type that i obviously
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:55.600]  inject when i forget to do it into my fat you know once a week or so
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:01.040]  on my stomach i really feel it because it's it's especially northern europeans
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:04.880]  in the genetics are missing some of the genes that are mitochondria
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:08.240]  to be able to absorb energy into them i have a hundred percent mitochondrial
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:11.360]  operation very rare i'm a mutant i've had two tests
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:14.640]  once i had it once i said we got to do this again at a big lab here in austin
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:17.680]  they had another lab doing there it's very rare but my grandpa had like one
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:20.000]  of the rarest types of blood it's a whole bunch of stuff i'm a mutant that
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:23.680]  northern europeans are i mean we're all mutants at one level or not but
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:28.160]  um ultra 12 b12 and this complex that it's in
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:31.280]  for absorption is something northern europeans particularly on the need but

[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:08.560]  with biden biden warren to share the stage for the first time at u.s
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:12.800]  democratic presidential debate all eyes are on that so yeah so there's
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:17.360]  my forecast is that biden will go after warren biden has been bitter ever since
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:21.600]  harris took after him he that bitterness has risen and intensified over the
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:24.960]  several months since then as the media has taken various
[1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:29.920]  potshots at him made fun of some of his simility made fun of his verbal twist
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:33.280]  and gas made fun of his uh doubted in question his
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:36.400]  electability uh and in particularly a challenge and
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:39.680]  contested his uh his entire legacy in the new
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:44.000]  wokeness era and the consequence of that is going to be that biden we saw it
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.880]  and we predicted it before the last debate we said he's gonna start attacking
[1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:49.920]  people remember he went after booker on something that was like six years old
[1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:53.360]  that had marginal relevance but it was just him he went after
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:57.600]  debasio at the very end uh so he was going after people with marginal roles
[1:50:57.600 --> 1:51:01.440]  marginal places in the debate structure just to make a send a message that if
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:05.280]  people attacked him he was going to start attacking everybody and exposing
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:08.960]  all of their weaknesses and one of the recent polling surveys uh out of the
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:12.080]  atlantic has shown that was done by a leftist group
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:15.600]  showed that the democratic voters are obsessed with electability
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:19.680]  because they recognize trump strength and they're so scared of trump strength
[1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:22.080]  they want someone who can beat him and the number one thing they're worried
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:24.240]  about is whether that person will come across as
[1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:28.400]  having character so that's why biden is attacking specifically on issues of
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:32.560]  character and integrity and identity and so look for him to attack elizabeth
[1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:35.360]  warren tonight and raise what she's been trying to hide
[1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:39.600]  which is her long involvement as a corporate lawyer in the bankruptcy arena
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:44.480]  helping people scavenge and and savagely attack various assets of domestic
[1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:48.400]  corporations she's met romney exactly she's met romney times two
[1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:52.800]  she helped deny breast implant victims that where they actually suffered
[1:51:52.800 --> 1:51:56.480]  various diseases and cancer and other problems related to it
[1:51:56.480 --> 1:52:01.280]  to various uh production and design makers who then went into bankruptcy
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:04.240]  she helped to protect them from having to pay what they were due to pay under
[1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:07.760]  various settlements and judgments she helped various companies
[1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:11.440]  take apart small businesses and destroy them she helped big wall street in
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:15.600]  corporate america uh do basically devalue and demolish
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:20.560]  large parts of industrial america deny pension benefits deny workers benefits
[1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:24.080]  deny uh victims of fraud deny victims of medical
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:28.560]  device the devices that caused harm as severe harm in many instances severe
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:31.520]  harm specifically to women in particular instances
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:35.120]  so it goes right to the core of everything she claims she's against
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:38.480]  claims she's against wall street claims she's against corporate fraud claims
[1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:42.400]  she's against corporate power claims she's against institutional control
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:46.000]  was bragging yesterday about cnbc saying wall street doesn't want her as a
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.640]  president uh and so i think biden will go right to
[1:52:48.640 --> 1:52:52.080]  the heart of that go right to attack the core of her credibility and character
[1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:54.880]  and by the way he's warned them and i don't like biden but i mean they're even
[1:52:54.880 --> 1:52:58.880]  worse than him in many cases he's warned me said listen honey and listen kid
[1:52:58.880 --> 1:53:03.280]  i can tear the hell out of you guys if i want and he can he can go after harris
[1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:07.440]  you know in her whole background like viciously locking blacks up with triple
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:11.280]  the the time like hillary did of course he was involved in that too
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:15.760]  he can go after her and her you know great grandpa being the militia that
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:19.600]  killed all the native americans in oklahoma i mean that's what the left is
[1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:23.040]  they tell you what you want to hear that they're your advocate but if they're
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:26.560]  black their advocacy is to enslave you and that's why they look like you they've
[1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:30.240]  been hired to do it with warren she loves native americans it's all lies
[1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:34.480]  she loves women yeah she loves to you know have breast implant uh deals with
[1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:37.120]  the breast implants are killing women she makes sure you don't get the money
[1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:40.800]  she's a corporate raider it's why the system loves her oh she's gonna stop
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:44.640]  big tech censorship by giving them legislation to protect them and let them
[1:53:44.640 --> 1:53:47.680]  censor everything you hear from her is the opposite
[1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:52.000]  she is a psychotic weasel she is a sociopath bare minimum
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:55.040]  who goes oh i'm gonna have a beer want a beer no honey don't drink beer
[1:53:55.040 --> 1:53:58.960]  oh here i'm here drinking beer she's like an alien pretending she's human
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:01.760]  oh no doubt about it very fake at the very core and that's what he's going to
[1:54:01.760 --> 1:54:04.480]  be attacking so even though he'll be talking about corporate issues and
[1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:07.760]  other lee and other lawyer issues she she even put out a report where she
[1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:10.880]  tried to disguise she tried to pretend that she helped victims
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:13.840]  of breast implants get money when she was out through the night when she was
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:17.280]  getting paid to keep them from get from them getting and again it turns out
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:21.680]  people from texas and oklahoma almost everyone who had family that came here
[1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:25.440]  anywhere from the 1820s to the 19 i mean most people
[1:54:25.440 --> 1:54:29.360]  women tended to die on the frontier right and so the and so
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:32.400]  you know both sides of my family people married their second wife was Native
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:35.360]  American and there actually wasn't as discriminatory as you hear in all the
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:38.240]  media it's all been in what tribe you were in and the natives were always
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:40.880]  trying to get you to attack the other tribe and it was all this going back
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:44.640]  and forth but comanche you know all those groups
[1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:48.480]  and again for her to basically have zero Native American
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:52.400]  and be from oklahoma i mean that must have meant they were really really
[1:54:52.400 --> 1:54:55.280]  didn't like uh the quote redskins i mean because
[1:54:55.280 --> 1:54:57.920]  almost everybody in oklahoma is part Native American
[1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:02.000]  and her ancestors got awards for their devastating
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:07.040]  vicious violent assaults and attacks on various my great grandmother was named
[1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:10.160]  her first name was moon right she was almost completely
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:12.720]  Native American right now and my dad's
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:16.480]  you know grandfather married her and loved her so and my dad went to Native
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:19.520]  events he didn't brag about it my dad's when they were the real deal not like
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:23.200]  you go to some fake Indian reservation and buy plastic tomahawks and some
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:26.000]  you know some some mexicans dance around a fire in front of you right but
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.520]  again i never even play that card right well the i mean my uh
[1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:32.960]  Indian law professor at wisconsin first thing he taught me was
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:35.600]  he said the number one thing Native Americans have to watch out for is
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:38.880]  Indian loving liberals you know that they're the most dangerous of them all
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:41.680]  he said they'll come dancing across here you know if they want to discover what
[1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:44.800]  what my father thinks is is longtime Native American father
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:47.840]  believes is 100 Native American of his tribe
[1:55:47.840 --> 1:55:50.800]  thinks about property rights and gun rights they can just sort of and thinks
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:53.680]  he's just sort of you know dancing to the sky why don't you just cross his
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:56.240]  lawn late at night and you'll find out what he thinks about both property
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:59.680]  rights and gun rights so the the the idea here she
[1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:04.560]  comes from an Indian hating community an Indian hating family
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:08.080]  and yet she was pretending to be Native American it's just perfect chameleon
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:11.360]  garbage absolutely just like she says i'm deeply anti-corporate
[1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:15.600]  yet she spent her life as a corporate lawyer in bankruptcy denying
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:18.720]  ordinary people benefits she says she hates banks
[1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:22.640]  bankruptcy court is mainly designed so that banks win before everyone else
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:25.360]  and that's who she helped win well i'll just be honest i've looked because we
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:28.800]  have my family's in the history books we slaughtered tons of Native Americans
[1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:31.760]  by the way with Native Americans right beside us demanding we do it i mean you
[1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:35.280]  study what really went on it was just it was constant war with everybody and the
[1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:38.480]  most peace oriented tribes got wiped out mostly by other
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:41.280]  more hostile tribes yeah that's that's just the long history that's why this
[1:56:41.280 --> 1:56:44.080]  that's why there's more sue around and seminal around the command
[1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:47.680]  command my bloodline is the most vicious group there was the only group that
[1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:50.800]  really survived from a Native American tribal perspective that was not that
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:53.840]  violent was the Cherokee and that's because they had such a large swath
[1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:56.640]  of and they had political power i mean they knew how to actually develop
[1:56:56.640 --> 1:56:59.680]  language they developed democracy they were ahead of the curve across the
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:02.320]  board they were the most one of the most enlightened men they were able to make
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:05.360]  better deals with the white man absolutely they were John Ross they
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:08.720]  you know John Ross's home is right near my old uh it was about two minutes
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:12.320]  from my hometown and where my home was in Chattanooga Tennessee so amazing
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:14.560]  then you got a home of a quanta parker and all that stuff
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:18.720]  exactly great great history um but uh Elizabeth Warren was not part of the
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:22.080]  great part of that history and yet she's lying about it why just the same
[1:57:22.080 --> 1:57:24.720]  reason she's lying about being a corporate lawyer a bank lawyer at wall
[1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:27.520]  street it's amazing you can go to family cemeteries we've got
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:30.160]  most latinians and ours anymore but they let us go on these ranches and stuff
[1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:33.520]  and like a third of the tombstones are killed by indians
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:36.960]  yeah i mean this was not you know this was not like people playing patty kick
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:40.720]  here no we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen on the other side
[1:57:40.720 --> 1:57:45.680]  we're gonna get into them trying to start a race war stay with us

[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:48.720]  but this time against leftist drooling trendy white people mainly

[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:22.800]  the news. sure so the uh so i think tonight people
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:25.840]  are looking for whether harris can survive or whether she's doa they're
[2:01:25.840 --> 2:01:29.680]  looking for biden to uh to attack warren and and whether biden will
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:33.280]  continue his hey if you'd help try to try to destroy my legacy i'm just
[2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:36.240]  going to burn the whole house down which has basically been his approach i mean
[2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:39.440]  i think the democratic establishment is going to greatly regret
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:43.200]  coercing biden to run when there was a lot of evidence he did as you reported
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:45.920]  that he did not want to run that he was not interested in running
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:49.280]  that he had moved on and moved past that stage of his career in his life
[2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:52.320]  just wanted to live out his grandpa joe i mean he's one step from a wheelchair
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:54.880]  already absolutely and i think he knew that knows
[2:01:54.880 --> 2:01:58.320]  that and he's exposing himself to the world he i don't think he minds the
[2:01:58.320 --> 2:02:01.280]  health hits as much as he minds the legacy hits
[2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:05.120]  he wanted to be just nice old grandpa joe and the democratic the legacy now is
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:08.400]  the guy that's falling on his face exactly and he's becoming the source
[2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:12.400]  the centerpiece for the woke world to indict to say everything that's wrong is
[2:02:12.400 --> 2:02:16.480]  this old white he's the old white man pinata exactly and he doesn't like being
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:20.160]  the old white man pinata so he's going to take it out on every single other
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:22.960]  democrat which is going to be beautiful it'll be absolutely gorgeous to watch
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:26.640]  you know he's got a list of attacks oh absolutely it's it's it's it's literally
[2:02:26.640 --> 2:02:29.920]  he's got the kerosene he's got the he's got the lighter and he's just going to
[2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:32.720]  light it what's the whole house burn up says you want to burn me down fine i
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:35.680]  burn all you down so fine by your prediction is it's
[2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:39.280]  going to be a bloodbath of firestorm tonight exactly
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:42.960]  and be and it's because it's in order for him to survive he's got to just start
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:46.720]  torturing everybody and at a minimum i think at this point he no longer cares
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:50.240]  i think he just wants to have payback and punishment for everybody trying to
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:54.080]  take him out and he's going to call it transparency exactly
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:57.120]  so yeah exactly if you can get that word out i mean it'll be interesting to see
[2:02:57.120 --> 2:03:00.640]  what how how that works as verbiage works whether he will continue to
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:06.160]  self-destruct of his senile tour of 2019 so the uh it'll be interesting
[2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:09.200]  bernie with this the first time they're on the stage together bernie doesn't like to
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:13.440]  talk about anything other than issues uh the the over under on bernie is to
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:16.320]  raise his hands and do this bit at least three times
[2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:19.600]  well he does that you know i swindled schools
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:24.080]  first paycheck i got was 40 i run things now do you understand
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:27.760]  huh this guy's never had a blue collar job in his life that he could sustain i
[2:03:27.760 --> 2:03:30.560]  mean he was a terrible carpenter he wasn't a good worker he's all
[2:03:30.560 --> 2:03:33.520]  the government paycheck has been his only key to life that's why he thinks the
[2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:37.440]  government paycheck is the key that knows how to tell you what to do
[2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:40.960]  exactly so the and he's been running from his immigration position that he held
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:44.640]  in 2015 when he said open borders was that was the only thing ever reasonable
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:48.640]  because it'll bankrupt things exactly he's running away from his long legacy
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:53.040]  in opposition to gun control as fast as he can so it's an embarrassment
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:55.840]  watching him and embrace the woke world because he's
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:03:58.480]  dependent upon his millennial base like sort of a
[2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:02.560]  a mid-level communist who has to appease the Stalinists within the party
[2:04:02.560 --> 2:04:06.560]  so the as we usually see how much he further trends in that direction
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:09.520]  and strays in that direction the fun people are all not on the stage other
[2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:12.320]  than yang yang has promised to do something no democratic
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:15.040]  nominee has ever done or democratic candidate has ever done
[2:04:15.040 --> 2:04:17.920]  who knows what that means maybe he's gonna wear a big gold chain
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:21.840]  maybe he's gonna make another asian math joke but we'll see
[2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:26.480]  so the asian what yes i mean the uh he loves to tell asian math jokes
[2:04:26.480 --> 2:04:29.920]  you know the i'm asian i like math that scares donald trump he likes to do
[2:04:29.920 --> 2:04:33.680]  these sort of things i don't think donald trump is scared of that at all
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:37.440]  donald trump just wants to build hotels in asian countries exactly
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:40.960]  we're going to be right back with a bunch of news trump to fly banner over
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:44.080]  houston ahead of immigrant debate socialism will kill houston's economy
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:47.200]  i like how trump's taking a page when we put up the trump air force remember that

[2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:32.240]  look at the fbi's what we're doing here in a moment but first with robert barnes
[2:06:32.240 --> 2:06:35.680]  riding shotgun with me we're here live right for tonight
[2:06:35.680 --> 2:06:39.360]  past 11 p.m we've been live since david night kicked off
[2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:42.640]  this morning at 8 a.m with the david night show
[2:06:42.640 --> 2:06:45.920]  right through the war room right through firepower bill johnson will be
[2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:48.800]  co-hosting with us tonight with tom papper as well but obviously the
[2:06:48.800 --> 2:06:52.720]  coverage of his regular show is preempted uh it'll be firepower with all
[2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:56.000]  these great guests all these great hosts uh and we're going to have live
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:07:01.040]  coverage of the houston debates that the others were again spectacular
[2:07:01.040 --> 2:07:06.320]  promising all these goodies spectacular white people are evil
[2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:10.480]  devils from white people uh spectacular lies
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:13.600]  and so it was so horrible it was interesting but still frightening to
[2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:16.720]  know that this is really what they admit they are
[2:07:16.720 --> 2:07:19.680]  well tonight though the knives are out and i think we're going to see the
[2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:23.120]  house burn down as robert barnes which is saying when they
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:26.960]  attack biden so i'm not just hyping this you to tune in i think
[2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:30.080]  tonight's going to be spectacular i'm excited we've got reporters on the
[2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:32.400]  ground and last time i thought it'd be super boring
[2:07:32.400 --> 2:07:35.920]  but they'd offer a bunch of free stuff and it was so depressing i had to
[2:07:35.920 --> 2:07:38.880]  leave both times or i was going to say really nasty things
[2:07:38.880 --> 2:07:42.640]  on air uh we'll see what happens tonight but i've walked off the coverage and i
[2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:44.800]  never i mean i have trouble watching these people
[2:07:44.800 --> 2:07:49.120]  but we have to because they want to run our lives tonight though i think you're
[2:07:49.120 --> 2:07:51.920]  right it's going to be a bloodbath what do you think i mean you have three
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:55.360]  candidates that have three major problems uh biden can't get any young
[2:07:55.360 --> 2:07:57.520]  people to like him within the democratic party
[2:07:57.520 --> 2:08:00.880]  bernie can't get any can't get any old people to like him within the democratic
[2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:04.320]  party and warren can't get any black people to like her in the democratic
[2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:07.440]  party primary process so if they can't overcome those hurdles it's
[2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:10.240]  hard to see how any of the three somehow win it will almost be
[2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:13.840]  there's increasing predictions today from sean trendy at real clear politics
[2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:17.840]  nobody in mind from yale that there's going to be a contested convention for
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:22.320]  the first time in the modern primary era since 1972
[2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:26.880]  so the the and of course 1972 did not go well for the democratic party
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:30.400]  so we may see a fascinating brokered convention and then who do they steal it
[2:08:30.400 --> 2:08:33.440]  from do they steal it from india and elizabeth warren
[2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:37.680]  do they steal it again from old man bernie do they steal it from old man joe
[2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:41.440]  from creepy uncle joe who do they steal it from and here's the wild card
[2:08:41.440 --> 2:08:44.880]  this has even come out on front line we saw the documents decades ago even
[2:08:44.880 --> 2:08:50.240]  front line there's some documentaries about nixon wanted to bomb his own
[2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:54.080]  convention and blame it on the democrats till they explain sir your
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:57.360]  numbers are great then there were plans to
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:08:59.920]  bomb their convention to make them look like commies
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:03.520]  then the left it turned out there were some plans to stage attacks and blame
[2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:06.880]  on nixon so this is something that goes on so let's be clear are they going to
[2:09:06.880 --> 2:09:09.280]  stage a mass shooting on themselves we know they've done it before
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:12.560]  some of the shootings are real but all the studies just type in
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:16.720]  studies show media giving attention to mass shootings triggers them because
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:21.120]  now it's an option for schizophrenics and nuts instead of killing themselves as
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:24.480]  i'm you know i'm going to go out do this in a blaze of glory so
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:28.720]  they're hyping all the mass shootings hoping something like that happens
[2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:32.320]  and they're telling us attacks on the media attacks by the right wing
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:35.440]  our epidemic they're happening any minute that begs the question are they
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:39.120]  trying to provoke a turret or are they knowing something that we don't
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:41.360]  know robert barnes well think about who might
[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:44.640]  stage such a provocation who has a history of
[2:09:44.640 --> 2:09:48.320]  unique political involvement around the world who might want to come in as the
[2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:52.240]  white horse to save the day when they can't decide between bernie
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:55.600]  biden or a warren because they all have huge
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:59.120]  institutional flaws who might want to ride in on the white horse
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:02.160]  best done by staging violence outside the proceedings
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:05.920]  that can come in and save the democratic party from itself
[2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:09.040]  and get reappointed to the presidency that she believes she's rightfully
[2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:12.000]  entitled to that yesterday she was in front of a fake oval
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:16.560]  office fake uh oval office desk pretending to actually read emails of
[2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:19.360]  all things uh pretending to be president
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:23.120]  who is it that would break greatly benefit from a brokered convention
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:26.640]  who is it that would desire a brokered convention who would love to have sort of
[2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:30.720]  and tifa well remember in fact we've seen previews for fake provocations like
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:34.000]  this or staged provocations and stage just means
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:37.120]  doesn't mean that the provocation itself isn't occurring so they create the
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:39.280]  climate exactly like charlesville they're
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:42.240]  saying i said the government killed the girl who had the
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:46.160]  heart attack or whatever no i'm saying the police stand down
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:49.360]  they hire a bunch of fake right wingers we know work for the left most of them
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:52.880]  some real racist idiots show up you bring out the antifa scum
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:55.920]  and they have a huge conflagration the police march them into each other
[2:10:55.920 --> 2:10:59.760]  hoping somebody got killed to then blame trump and then they sued me
[2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:03.440]  saying that i'm saying that this dude did it himself
[2:11:03.440 --> 2:11:07.600]  and then then they say in my name the defamation against themselves right
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:10.160]  exactly and what's amazing about all of that is
[2:11:10.160 --> 2:11:13.360]  the way the way i always describe it to people is this if you want to understand
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:16.640]  what it means to say an event and stage just look at how the media
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:20.720]  covers putin and russia so there they'll say this is stage this is stage he's
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:24.400]  orchard oh islamic blew up a building putin did it just to meet a putin putin
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:28.000]  putin yeah but then we say hey did somebody stand the game for this
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:32.080]  shut up you evil person perfect example of this 2016 the way in which someone
[2:11:32.080 --> 2:11:35.200]  like hillary might do this was what mayor with the mayor of
[2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:39.120]  chicago longtime clinton ally at the time remember they staged when trump was
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:42.640]  supposed to come in they staged a bunch of bernie people
[2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:45.360]  creating a huge brawl purportedly bernie people
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:48.320]  even though bernie people up to that point had had no history of being violent
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:53.040]  and tifa had but bernie people didn't people purportedly being for bernie
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:56.960]  went in and staged a bunch of violence against trumps that was hillary came on
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:12:00.240]  wikileaks the exact and we said at the time it was hillary
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:04.080]  i said looks like hillary she stands the game it was and it was perfectly set up
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:06.720]  because the the narrative coming out to the press was
[2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:11.120]  bernie people are crazy and dangerous trump people are crazy and dangerous
[2:12:11.120 --> 2:12:15.840]  who's the solution oh hillary is so you could see the same sort of dynamic
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:19.200]  occur again if if you start to see that happen
[2:12:19.200 --> 2:12:22.000]  if there is a brokered convention and you start to see those kind of events
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:25.760]  take place you should be reasonably suspect and again i want to be clear
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:29.280]  exactly i don't make this stuff up i know people that have guarded hillary
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:31.680]  off and on for years i'm gonna leave it at that
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:34.480]  not just secret service but that too they're the ones that told us she drives
[2:12:34.480 --> 2:12:38.000]  around in a black ambulance she's falling out every 45 minutes
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:41.520]  just follow her well people did they caught it we caught it when she was in a tent
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:44.400]  uh but others caught it in new york on september 11 a few years ago three years
[2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:48.960]  ago uh three years ago yesterday and so that's really what this comes down to
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:51.920]  and the same people are like no she's on the phone she's in there right of the
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:54.560]  democratic party her foundation's still getting money
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:58.400]  and they all still kiss her ass because she's in control of obama
[2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:02.400]  of the stay behind networks and all the democratic bureaucrats that they put in
[2:13:02.400 --> 2:13:05.840]  and basically the bush people just advocated to her let her still kind of
[2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:08.720]  run it so hillary is still kind of the shadow
[2:13:08.720 --> 2:13:12.480]  president kind of like in england they'll have the main person of the x-checker
[2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:15.440]  but they'll have them you know the the shadow person that's for the party out
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:18.880]  of power but still has some power that's how they're operating the shadow
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:22.480]  government the deep state is hillary still bumbling around
[2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:25.920]  she's still got all her people in with national security clearances doing this
[2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:30.000]  and she still thinks that this is such a weak field that maybe she slips in
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:33.600]  then trump gets assassinated or something believe me this woman
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:36.640]  runs around pretending to be the president all over tv shows
[2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:40.160]  all over the media she was doing it again yesterday exactly why is she doing
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:43.680]  that stage photo yesterday or look at a political article and look how
[2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:46.160]  psychotic she is can we blow that up yeah exactly
[2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:48.560]  i'll say i'm gonna blow her up i don't mean that i mean zoom in on it
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:52.480]  can we zoom in for tv viewers on her i mean she looks like an
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:57.440]  animatronic robot at chuckie cheese yes she does i mean it's not a but she
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:01.680]  still doesn't understand photo ops but the uh uh you know that's what trump
[2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:04.800]  was laughing about in 2016 he said all these people that attack me they
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:07.920]  always get these great photos of me he's like i have to go get those photos
[2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:10.720]  because how good they are but the if you look at it the other thing is look at
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:13.360]  a political article and political sort of the insider
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:16.080]  publication in dc for the political consulting class
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:20.640]  just a few days ago where hillary was taking credit for the warren campaign
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:23.760]  they said warren's getting her advice from hillary hillary's help can
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:27.520]  almost like a henry kissinger kind of piece and so it was almost a message
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:31.280]  that she's setting something up so that there'll be one woman warren
[2:14:31.280 --> 2:14:35.200]  by two guys bernie and biden warren won't be able to get over the top
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:38.000]  she comes in and says the only real way to protect women's rights is to
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:41.600]  nominate hillary as the as the peace candidate between all of the

[2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:25.520]  having a show and i did actually expand that out
[2:21:25.520 --> 2:21:29.440]  um quite frankly uh to be honest with you i have a plan to launch something
[2:21:29.440 --> 2:21:32.480]  that's like a washington's journal but an america's
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:36.720]  journal maybe even a world journal like the first few hours is a caller from the
[2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:39.760]  u.s the caller from outside the u.s something that starts at four a.m in
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:44.080]  the morning and that we have a host that just covers news just shows the news
[2:21:44.080 --> 2:21:48.400]  shows a clip not much commentary maybe a little bit of opinion
[2:21:48.400 --> 2:21:52.160]  after you take calls and and just really make it about callers and we're trying
[2:21:52.160 --> 2:21:56.080]  to get more calls uh on the air here but we get unlimited great calls
[2:21:56.080 --> 2:21:59.280]  i'm trying to make the show more about calls as well because i love hearing
[2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:02.880]  what you say i love the angles you take us in but i'll be hosting that show
[2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:05.200]  with some of the callers that i've been getting over the years when i've had
[2:22:05.200 --> 2:22:09.040]  this idea this saturday two to four p.m and i'll be
[2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:12.000]  back live with the four to six p.m sunday show we've now been doing for 12
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:15.280]  years been doing this show in this time slot for 23 years
[2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:20.000]  20 to 22 and a half years uh so let's get into this
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:24.240]  right now maryan williamson came out on a hot mic
[2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:26.800]  this just came out the last few hours and other democrats were saying this
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:31.200]  last week and and talks about democrats being so vicious and so mean behind
[2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:35.360]  the scenes but also in perp uh in person
[2:22:35.360 --> 2:22:40.160]  and and and it's really being hateful and bad and it just blowing her away so
[2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:42.720]  a good part about a lot of the people get involved in politics that haven't been
[2:22:42.720 --> 2:22:46.560]  involved because they think trump's so evil is they actually find out
[2:22:46.560 --> 2:22:51.840]  the democrats are some nasty nasty uh folks so maryan williamson really gets
[2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:58.080]  woke now says the left is mean and lies uh here it is
[2:22:58.720 --> 2:23:02.560]  does it say that fox news is nicer to me than the lefties are
[2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:06.800]  i'm sorry what does it say that the conservatives are nicer to me
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:10.720]  it's a bizarre world man it's such a bizarre world
[2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:14.240]  you know i'm such a lefty i mean i'm a serious lefty but there's so
[2:23:14.240 --> 2:23:18.720]  i understand why people on the right call them godless i mean it's like
[2:23:18.720 --> 2:23:22.320]  i didn't think the left was as mean as the right they are
[2:23:22.320 --> 2:23:28.000]  i'm just just right and again she didn't even know she was
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:31.920]  on air uh so and similar comments are coming up
[2:23:31.920 --> 2:23:35.600]  here's another one i mean just on monday ron emmanuel said we can't offer
[2:23:35.600 --> 2:23:38.800]  everything free we're already almost bankrupt
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:41.920]  uh if we don't really grow our way out of this we are
[2:23:41.920 --> 2:23:45.920]  and at the same time you you you've seen other democrats
[2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:48.480]  come out and admit that but if they do they get shouted down because the
[2:23:48.480 --> 2:23:52.000]  globalist want policies that collapses because they can loot the whole
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  infrastructure fire it back up and dominate the planet but this time
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:00.480]  from a very anti god anti freedom anti american perspective here it is x
[2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:04.640]  obama official dim's going way too far to the left
[2:24:04.640 --> 2:24:09.520]  here it is on msnbc with jay johnson here it is
[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:16.800]  look most americans want to be fair and treat in a humane way
[2:24:16.800 --> 2:24:20.160]  those who have migrated here who are desperate
[2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:24.480]  who are fleeing really bad conditions we want to take care of people who came
[2:24:24.480 --> 2:24:28.960]  here as children we want to take care of the dreamers
[2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:33.280]  but americans also want secure borders they want to get control of illegal
[2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:37.760]  migration and that's true i know from laredo texas to
[2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:42.560]  to detroit michigan and so when we talk about
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:49.360]  deprioritizing uh the deportation of those apprehended at the border or
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:55.280]  decriminalizing illegal immigration i know that we're we're going way too far
[2:24:55.280 --> 2:24:59.200]  to the left of the american consensus on where we should be on this and you
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:04.320]  just cannot have a policy where a border patrol agent arrests someone at the
[2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:08.000]  border and says in effect you get to stay here
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.640]  unless you commit a crime and they commit a crime to get here
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:15.040]  and they expect everything free and by the way i should have opened the show up
[2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:17.840]  with this we didn't just win this big republican
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:20.640]  race the democrats everything they had into a north carolina
[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:24.720]  we didn't just you know see all these things unfold we also have the supreme
[2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:27.920]  court ruling we'll talk about next segment some the supreme court ruling
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:31.040]  that of course trump can have these strong
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:34.960]  amnesty laws he can have these strong laws on people claiming political asylum
[2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:38.160]  that clearly aren't when 15 000 people run over the
[2:25:38.160 --> 2:25:42.000]  mexican border and they're from africa or they're from south america
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:45.200]  and they they've got kidnapped kids you get a free ticket in
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:48.160]  and they're carrying drugs and then they run over our border
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:51.840]  hell yeah they're getting deported i mean give me a break no one i couldn't
[2:25:51.840 --> 2:25:55.600]  fly to mexico but show up and say i'm here to have my baby free they
[2:25:55.600 --> 2:25:58.800]  kick your ass i mean my god ladies and gentlemen when you
[2:25:58.800 --> 2:26:01.840]  fly into mexico they say what hotel you stay in at they call they check
[2:26:01.840 --> 2:26:05.120]  you don't fly out the day you say they arrest your ass
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:08.240]  but then we're supposed to get everything and just give it away free
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:11.920]  simply incredible and i see more and more democrats coming out saying
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:15.040]  hey back off guys not that they don't want this agenda to happen
[2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:18.880]  they just want the democrats to stop being honest oh no doubt about it i mean
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:21.920]  what maryan williamson is talking about you know maryan is what we did a
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:24.640]  segment of meditation with maryan and that's sort of her mindset her
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:29.040]  mentality obama's uh not obama but uh uh
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:33.040]  oprah winfrey's a spiritual advisor that's sort of her persona and personality
[2:26:33.040 --> 2:26:37.600]  and she's shocked by how harsh and vicious and vile and mean
[2:26:37.600 --> 2:26:41.440]  the left the modern left is and what it is is when the left what the left
[2:26:41.440 --> 2:26:45.600]  accuses the right of what my old friend john ablon who's on cnn accused
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:50.000]  on 9 11 decided to use 9 11 to attack so-called right-wingers and
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:53.600]  make up this fictional white nationalist violence all across the country
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:26:56.800]  that's not occurring uh the what that reflects is
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:00.800]  the projection of the left of onto the right of the left's
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:04.400]  of violence the left's anger but let's talk more about that since you mentioned
[2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:08.480]  it here's here here's a clip of that
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:16.000]  at 11 right-wing terrorists have killed more people in the united states than
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.880]  jihadist terrorists that's according to new america
[2:27:18.880 --> 2:27:22.160]  there are some folks for who they're for their own political purposes would like
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:26.000]  to keep the focus on only one form of political violence over another
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:29.920]  but that would be unwise because we don't have the luxury of choosing which
[2:27:29.920 --> 2:27:32.960]  threats we face and there's a case to be made that these threats actually
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:36.240]  echo each other as our colleague jim shuto and others have argued
[2:27:36.240 --> 2:27:39.840]  they're weaponized versions of tribalism motivated by fear and finding
[2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:44.000]  identity and their hatred of the other as max fisher of the times wrote in
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  both there's the apocalyptic ideology that predicts and promises to hasten a
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:52.320]  civilizational conflict that will consume the world to mark the 18th
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:56.400]  anniversary of 9 11 is to reflect on how we're all the children of 9 11
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:28:00.000]  that attack unleashed destructive forces that we're still wrestling with
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:03.440]  but to truly learn the lessons of 9 11 is to resolve
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:09.360]  not to let hate win or fear define us and that's your reality check and then
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:12.000]  they go on right-wingers or americans deadly as terrorists have the
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:14.640]  transcript here and then i've got the fbi numbers
[2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:17.600]  they just don't call it jihadi killing somebody or bombing something or
[2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:20.960]  shooting somebody a terror attack and robom would say oh that's not islamic
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:24.400]  that that's just a crime and then they take every shooting when the white guy
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:27.680]  does and say it's a terrorist act and then that's how they do it exactly it's
[2:28:27.680 --> 2:28:30.480]  manipulation of the numbers they know they are there is no great white
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:34.160]  nationalist threat nobody is afraid of of clansmen marching down the
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:37.840]  street and burning all of their homes that threat has long since passed the
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:40.800]  only real politicized violence has come on the left and has come from

[2:33:25.280 --> 2:33:29.360]  remember we're still on the air this is my big tech the democratic party the
[2:33:29.360 --> 2:33:35.520]  globalist and left this place put into the cia
[2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:39.280]  the charge of getting us off the air in congressional hearings
[2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:43.280]  three plus years ago two years ago last year this year
[2:33:43.280 --> 2:33:45.840]  we're putting together a compilation of that we're going to be airing the next
[2:33:45.840 --> 2:33:49.040]  few days it's more clips than i've thought of them saying in congress they
[2:33:49.040 --> 2:33:52.240]  want me taken completely off the air talk about an american
[2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:57.040]  don't forget what ananda varro said shut down i want them silence i want them
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:33:59.440]  muted i think they are horrible for our society
[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:02.880]  i want them shut down i want them silence i want them muted i think they are
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:06.480]  horrible for our society i want them shut down i want them
[2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:09.440]  silence i want them muted i think they are horrible for our society
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:12.960]  i want them shut down i want them silence i want them muted i think they are
[2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:16.160]  horrible for our society i want them shut down i want them
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:19.760]  i think that's good thank you that's what we're dealing with now i want to
[2:34:19.760 --> 2:34:22.480]  cover the waterfront here bars we haven't done this
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:25.600]  before with just a ton of different angles and
[2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:31.400]  and different issues and different areas in my stack and just kind of not like one word
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:35.200]  responses or 10 word responses, but maybe one minute responses because you're a smart
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:38.760]  guy and I want to get your take on a whole bunch of things here.
[2:34:38.760 --> 2:34:45.760]  But first off, the Supreme Court ruling that Trump, of course, that's in the Constitution,
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:49.800]  he can control who can come in from what country, just like his other so-called Muslim bands,
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:54.000]  was seven countries that don't have working state departments that don't have real passports,
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:58.040]  the imam-ish is it, and literal al-Qaeda and ISIS was coming in.
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:02.400]  So Supreme Court allows broad enforcement of Trump asylum rule that they didn't allow
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:03.400]  it.
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:04.400]  It's on its face.
[2:35:04.400 --> 2:35:08.800]  But what's scary is, thank God he's gotten 150 better judges, and I know you've been
[2:35:08.800 --> 2:35:09.800]  studying it.
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:10.800]  Are they really better?
[2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:14.920]  I think some of them are, onto the bench because that's blocking this leftist takeover
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:15.920]  that we see.
[2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:16.920]  I mean, is Gorsuch's perfect?
[2:35:16.920 --> 2:35:17.920]  No.
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:18.920]  Is Catalan perfect?
[2:35:18.920 --> 2:35:23.640]  No, but compared to Hillary would have put in, we see now courts that have been federal
[2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:28.120]  courts this week that have been overruled by the Supreme Court are issuing new rulings
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:29.120]  and ignoring it.
[2:35:29.120 --> 2:35:33.160]  I mean, this seems like beyond judicial tyranny, it's judicial mutiny.
[2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:36.920]  Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, D, what you're seeing is federal judges asserting they're
[2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:41.680]  particularly Obama appointees, asserting their power through the judicial branch as if they
[2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:43.880]  were elected president of the United States.
[2:35:43.880 --> 2:35:45.000]  And that's the problem.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:47.240]  And that's what the Supreme Court keeps overturning.
[2:35:47.240 --> 2:35:51.600]  So for example, one of the things that's not supposed to happen is a district court judge
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:57.160]  in the federal system should never be issuing, for the most part, nationwide injunctions.
[2:35:57.160 --> 2:36:01.680]  They should be limited to the parties before them and limited to their jurisdiction.
[2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:05.320]  So if you're a judge in the Northern District of California, your injunction should only
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:08.120]  apply in that district to the parties before you.
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:09.840]  It should not apply to Texas.
[2:36:09.840 --> 2:36:11.320]  It should not apply to New York.
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:14.640]  It should not apply to Florida, should not apply to Tennessee.
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:18.880]  And yet you have these judges can, and this has been repeatedly issued, the Supreme Court
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:23.560]  overturned a nationwide injunction on the gag rule going back to the Clinton's Clinton
[2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:25.960]  administration concerning gays in the military.
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:26.960]  That's kind of scare the left.
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:29.480]  I'm sorry to interrupt because you're on fire.
[2:36:29.480 --> 2:36:33.680]  The Supreme Court's been overturning everything they do because it's, I'm not even a lawyer
[2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:35.440]  and I can read the Constitution.
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:39.360]  Of course he can bar people from Somalia with their fake passports.
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:40.360]  He better?
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:41.360]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:42.360]  It's his duty.
[2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:43.360]  It's his obligation.
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:46.000]  In immigration and borders and anything outside the borders of the United States and controlling
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:51.920]  the borders of the United States has constitutionally been delegated almost exclusively to the president.
[2:36:51.920 --> 2:36:57.680]  And then Congress has reinforced that by putting in its immigration laws, giving him broad discretionary
[2:36:57.680 --> 2:37:00.840]  power to do as he sees fit and needs to do.
[2:37:00.840 --> 2:37:04.360]  Because the executives over the military and the military's jobs the damn border.
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:08.600]  Also some of these judges issuing these nationwide junctions were often the same judges who either
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:14.520]  promised in their confirmation proceedings or later as a judge denied the power of Arizona,
[2:37:14.520 --> 2:37:19.160]  the state of Arizona, to try to impose any immigration rules of its own saying that,
[2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:23.040]  hey, that's preempted by the president and you can't try to do anything to undermine
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:25.360]  what the great Obama has to try.
[2:37:25.360 --> 2:37:29.000]  Then of course Trump does it and all of a sudden they completely reverse the same legal
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:31.400]  principles they applied to protect Obama.
[2:37:31.400 --> 2:37:34.640]  Suddenly they say don't apply to protect the president when in fact they're more specific
[2:37:34.640 --> 2:37:36.960]  in particular and relevant and applicable.
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:41.280]  So there's been hypocrisy and inconsistency in the court system and what's most dangerous
[2:37:41.280 --> 2:37:46.720]  is this is an ideology on the left that say results are all that matters.
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:51.840]  The ends justify the means that say we can contort and distort the rule of law solely
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:55.640]  to serve the principle of power in the objective of the leftist agenda.
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:37:59.520]  And that is a direct threat not just to the principles that President Trump got elected
[2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:03.480]  on but it's a direct threat to the rule of law in the United States.
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:08.760]  And that makes it as a lawyer a particularly pernicious threat what these unjustified precedents
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:09.760]  are doing.
[2:38:09.760 --> 2:38:16.600]  And Bob when you pull back from this and you see how Trump's gotten 150 to the federal
[2:38:16.600 --> 2:38:23.360]  judiciary hundreds more about to happen you've got Ruth Bader Ginsburg who has pancreatic
[2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:31.320]  cancer that kills 93% of people within a year what 98% of people within five years it's
[2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:37.640]  almost incurable and she's already so sick she'll be gone in a year she'll be gone before
[2:38:37.640 --> 2:38:42.040]  the election Trump will get his nominee that's why they want revolution that's why they
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:46.000]  want race war that's why they want to crash the economy and you have the private Federal
[2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:52.960]  Reserve and Democrats openly saying let's crash it and literally bankrupt people that's
[2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:57.920]  financial terrorism is because they know they're losing and that's why we can just hold the
[2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:01.880]  line and if Trump could just do something about the censorship and if we can win this
[2:39:01.880 --> 2:39:06.080]  election Trump is overall doing a great job and if you're on the fence about that look
[2:39:06.080 --> 2:39:10.480]  how he just got rid of that neocon lunatic how about keep your friends close enemies
[2:39:10.480 --> 2:39:14.880]  closer I just my gut level I'm very pleased with Trump and then when I pull back from
[2:39:14.880 --> 2:39:19.440]  all the pessimism all of us that's left is generated out there to be mad at Trump and
[2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:22.920]  again I get we've got to keep his feet to the fire or he'll go sideways just because
[2:39:22.920 --> 2:39:27.600]  of the of his personality and I'm kind of all over the map here how would you quantify
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:30.800]  what I'm trying to say essentially what is his Trump is doing all that he can but he's
[2:39:30.800 --> 2:39:37.480]  facing an internal war with a deeply entrenched deep state that has extraordinary administrative
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:42.040]  influence within almost every bureaucratic aspect of government but not only that it
[2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:47.520]  has completely infiltrated large parts of our judicial brand sure and but but they are
[2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:52.240]  trying to overthrow the whole system now because they realize I think fundamentally they're
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:57.000]  losing oh no doubt what is it the more he succeeds the more threatened they feel just
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:40:01.880]  like media gatekeepers as they lose their gatekeeper control and their gatekeeper monopoly they're
[2:40:01.880 --> 2:40:06.400]  going to be more desperate and that desperation is going to produce more extreme actions on
[2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:09.960]  their behalf and that's when people have to be the most vigilant so we're winning the
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:15.000]  fight but we're going to get ticked and hit bit pretty hard in this but we got to go through
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:19.560]  it we so people better just realize whether it's keeping this broadcast on air because
[2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:23.200]  I mean we're central to the talking points of reality we put out and the guess we have
[2:40:23.200 --> 2:40:28.600]  I mean we rewrote the whole deal we rebooted America you did so again spreading the word
[2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:33.080]  I'm getting shows right now supporting the broadcast praying for us and buying the products
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:37.920]  like high quality fish oil and great new tropics and amazing turmeric and amazing bone broth
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:44.120]  and the best B12 out there it's all 50% off right now we're only making 30% or so on these
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:48.760]  we just sell a ton of this to fund the operation because that's how we fund ourselves we were
[2:40:48.760 --> 2:40:53.400]  we rebut that which doesn't kill us made us stronger they took our sponsors away they
[2:40:53.400 --> 2:40:56.280]  took everything away over the years well we just went to direct sales and brought you
[2:40:56.280 --> 2:41:01.880]  great products but it's so important now folks I thank you but thank yourself to realize
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:06.560]  that your word of mouth going to this election tell me about the local radio stations the
[2:41:06.560 --> 2:41:12.200]  local TV stations are info wars dot com four slash show or band dot video they'll block
[2:41:12.200 --> 2:41:18.200]  you on Twitter and Facebook would punish you you know for trying to put out things like
[2:41:18.200 --> 2:41:22.440]  you know info wars dot com but not so much news wars dot com not so much summit dot news
[2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:27.640]  Paul site the president Trump has retweeted and and of course band dot video so again
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:32.000]  your word of mouth and your financial support this is a real war I just go back to that
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:37.040]  because I'm thinking about how close this fight is and it could be snatched away from
[2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:41.040]  us and the folks if we go into a physical revolution if they're successful with violence
[2:41:41.040 --> 2:41:45.560]  which they want so badly it is going to be hellish and we're going to win that too but
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:50.360]  we don't want to go down that road no doubt me you have the media is a cornered adversary
[2:41:50.360 --> 2:41:54.680]  the institutional deep state apparatus is a cornered adversary the democratic party is
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:41:58.440]  a cornered adversary that's when they are the most dangerous and where else can people
[2:41:58.440 --> 2:42:03.840]  get healthier get wealthier get wiser and eat and change the world easier than just
[2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:07.520]  going to info wars store that's it I mean it's extraordinary you you buy products you want

[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:20.280]  they're scared of this model absolutely because they don't want shows or magazines or people
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:24.520]  to be supported because this is popular and it won't be Hollywood and the media perched
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:28.800]  on us force feeding us things that aren't popular it's like Dave Chappelle 99% from
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:33.200]  the people you know see we all have little correctness for his comedy show zero from

[2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:32.120]  the know that there's a deep state group working within our government with radical Islam who
[2:45:32.120 --> 2:45:37.120]  are using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering

[2:47:40.760 --> 2:47:47.880]  us attorney recommends proceeding with charges against andrew mccabe as doj rejects last
[2:47:47.880 --> 2:47:53.640]  week appeal I told you a year ago that I was told that in maryland in virginia grand juries
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:48:00.040]  were open on him this isn't some nebulous stuff this was from high level sources and that the
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:05.200]  word is they had issued silt indictments real ones now barns knows more how this works than
[2:48:05.200 --> 2:48:09.160]  I do and he's done a lot of famous criminal cases and he was reading over the fox news
[2:48:09.160 --> 2:48:12.920]  he says they don't understand exactly what was just said but in the meat of it they are
[2:48:12.920 --> 2:48:17.640]  correct and so to go over this we have him here to break it down we'll do a little bit
[2:48:17.640 --> 2:48:20.320]  in the next hour than that brackets coming up to get to all the other stuff I said I
[2:48:20.320 --> 2:48:24.320]  would but this is breaking now I think you agree with me we need to hit this now I just
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:29.440]  kind of lost my brother because this means I mean trumps on the rampage the fact that
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:33.560]  they're doing this means the house of cards is coming down man this is really good news
[2:48:33.560 --> 2:48:39.320]  and I told you the word is from people when I was in DC three months ago I talked to three
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:43.600]  people that were in face-to-face meetings with Trump and he said no they're going after
[2:48:43.600 --> 2:48:49.600]  him U.S. Attorney Jesse Lou has recommended moving forward with charges against Andrew
[2:48:49.600 --> 2:48:53.840]  McCabe Fox News has learned as the Justice Department rejects at last ditch appeal that's
[2:48:53.840 --> 2:48:57.120]  not literally a legal appeal through courts it means through the system from the former
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:02.000]  top FBI official McCabe the former deputy and acting director of the FBI appealed the
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:06.800]  decision of the U.S. Attorney from Washington all the way up to Jeffrey Rosen and that was
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:10.720]  just internal the deputy attorney general but he rejected the request according to
[2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:14.920]  a person familiar with the situation that's when he started putting out little messages
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:24.720]  apologizing to him to his boss over there the seven foot eight creature Comey the potential
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:30.960]  charges relate to DOJ inspector general findings against him and of course we've seen the Texas
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:35.200]  congressman that Trump recommended to be the head of national intelligence but the left
[2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:38.520]  freaked out saying the word is he's got to be indicted and that he is going to be indicted
[2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:43.200]  and that was over the weekend sources close to McCabe legal team said they received an
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:46.920]  email from the Department of Justice which the department rejected your appeal the United
[2:49:46.920 --> 2:49:50.440]  States Attorney General's decision in the matter now you're here to decipher this isn't
[2:49:50.440 --> 2:49:54.600]  a court what type of appeal this really is and and and what you read here on the TV is
[2:49:54.600 --> 2:49:59.000]  but this am I right so far this this shows the dam's breaking oh no doubt about it the
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:03.760]  inside story on this is fascinating so all of this started Andrew McCabe was the acting
[2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:09.360]  actual director of the FBI so he'll be the first FBI director I know of to ever be criminally
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:13.800]  prosecuted in our history even though most of them frankly could have been for various
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:18.280]  things they did while they were there so this is big this is watershed massive massive because
[2:50:18.280 --> 2:50:21.520]  they tried to take down an elected president sorry you're not bigger than that this is
[2:50:21.520 --> 2:50:26.040]  one of the most powerful members of the deep state finally seeing potential consequences
[2:50:26.040 --> 2:50:32.520]  for his condo will this have Hillary crapping bricks maybe I mean Hillary feels so immune
[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:36.360]  from the process though Hillary was deeply embedded with this his potential information
[2:50:36.360 --> 2:50:40.840]  he has said before that he will rat anybody and everybody out he's made that clear that
[2:50:40.840 --> 2:50:44.280]  he'll rat comey out he'll rat anyone else out remember me that's what's seeing in
[2:50:44.280 --> 2:50:50.120]  hard in his hush money exactly remember McCabe is the guy who raised almost $700,000 overnight
[2:50:50.120 --> 2:50:54.280]  for his legal defense are we gonna see we're not making a threat we wanted a little long
[2:50:54.280 --> 2:50:59.440]  time in prison are we are we gonna see Epstein McCabe we're gonna see him have a canoeing
[2:50:59.440 --> 2:51:04.080]  accident well the well he will not be jailed so the assuming he's indicted so here's the
[2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:07.960]  back story Jesse Lew was the Trump appointed United States Attorney for the District of
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:13.440]  Columbia when the the it was the Inspector General Horowitz who was actually an appointee
[2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:19.000]  of Obama but was so independent and so ethical that the Obama administration under Sally Yates
[2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:23.240]  stripped him of his ability to even investigate a wide range of matters even though that was
[2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:29.560]  his duty under the law so once Obama was out Trump gave him restored that power and authority
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:35.320]  to him and it was Horowitz's report that said McCabe had committed multiple felonies while
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:39.720]  either being the deputy director or the actual director of the FBI let's talk about some
[2:51:39.720 --> 2:51:43.520]  of those things they did exactly I mean it's he was basically committed he lied to them
[2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:48.880]  so he obstructed justice he misled them he was leaking information illicitly in violation
[2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:54.080]  not only of internal FBI rules but in violation specific law line to Congress and misleading
[2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:58.960]  Congress repeatedly of misleading the president United States repeatedly purportedly involved
[2:51:58.960 --> 2:52:03.160]  in a plan to illicitly wiretap the president he told the president no one's ever spied
[2:52:03.160 --> 2:52:07.920]  on you when he was directing it exactly orchestrating it organizing it running it this was the guy
[2:52:07.920 --> 2:52:11.440]  that was ahead of Peter Strozik this was the guy that was ahead of all the key people doing
[2:52:11.440 --> 2:52:16.480]  all the illicit activity Comey was the guy who was sort of the rubber stamp McCabe was
[2:52:16.480 --> 2:52:21.080]  the actual orchestrator and organizer of all of it so he also knows where all the bodies
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:25.000]  are buried because remember it was his wife who was running for office in Virginia they
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:29.760]  gave a half million to exactly and who was it that helped orchestrate Hillary the exactly
[2:52:29.760 --> 2:52:33.000]  because it was the governor of Virginia that helped orchestrate that who has been the long
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:37.720]  time I got a story about him the long time money man for the for the for the Clintons
[2:52:37.720 --> 2:52:42.800]  going way way back there are deals involving him in high powerful democratic media supporters
[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:47.520]  how Clinton used him as a money man that's why I said I mean this is a Clinton operative
[2:52:47.520 --> 2:52:53.120]  and who ran all the illegal espionage I mean wow there it was McCabe who shut down the
[2:52:53.120 --> 2:52:57.040]  email investigation in certain aspects of it not Comey it was McCabe who was directing
[2:52:57.040 --> 2:53:00.800]  key so this is a Clinton creature there's a guy who helped direct who helped cancel
[2:53:00.800 --> 2:53:05.720]  the Clinton Foundation investigation so I mean this guy is at the center of the cover up
[2:53:05.720 --> 2:53:10.400]  of the Clinton corruption and they attempted to the president United States and here's
[2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:15.440]  the backstory on this Jesse Lou originally was slow playing this so there was a lot of
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:18.520]  people that were upset that thought McCabe should have been indicted over a year ago
[2:53:18.520 --> 2:53:22.520]  should have been indicted before the 2018 elections which could have helped Trump what
[2:53:22.520 --> 2:53:26.960]  is this I was told by about grand juries open on it so the there are potential grand juries
[2:53:26.960 --> 2:53:30.440]  but the way the grand juries operate is they simply gather information so there's but what
[2:53:30.440 --> 2:53:36.040]  we call an invest in inside the business we call a investigative grand jury and an indictment
[2:53:36.040 --> 2:53:40.840]  grand jury and invest theoretically constitutionally every grand jury should just be an investigative
[2:53:40.840 --> 2:53:44.520]  grand jury but it's not practically how it works because prosecutors have carte blanche
[2:53:44.520 --> 2:53:48.920]  power in there but what happens is investigative grand jury just gets information they're not
[2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:53.280]  looking to indict anyone they're just looking the it's the tool by which the US attorney
[2:53:53.280 --> 2:54:00.440]  can secretly get evidence about someone secretly gets a penis and secretly have testimony etc.
[2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:04.080]  and they usually scare witnesses into thinking that witnesses can't talk about what happened
[2:54:04.080 --> 2:54:07.400]  before the grand jury when it's actually only the government the grand jurors who can't
[2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:10.680]  talk about it but that's why they like it that's why they use it as a tool but what
[2:54:10.680 --> 2:54:15.280]  happened here is a lot of people believe that Jesse Lou was slow playing it and because
[2:54:15.280 --> 2:54:18.240]  he was slow playing it they started getting increasingly agitated over the last several
[2:54:18.240 --> 2:54:22.840]  months also somebody close to Trump leaked that he was originally considering giving
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:26.240]  a big promotion to Lou and I talked about this a year and a half ago there's if she
[2:54:26.240 --> 2:54:29.680]  would indict McCabe the president would probably put her number two or number three in the
[2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:33.680]  Department of Justice she didn't and so he let leak that he had originally planned on
[2:54:33.680 --> 2:54:37.120]  doing that but given how she was slow playing these corruption investigations he was having
[2:54:37.120 --> 2:54:42.040]  second thoughts so it's not a surprise that suddenly she decided to accelerate the prosecution
[2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:46.480]  and the language they use here isn't quite correct what happens is certain kinds of cases
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:50.840]  like tax cases I do a lot of criminal tax cases they have to be approved by the US attorney
[2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:55.640]  for the tax division the local US attorney can't run those cases almost all cases the
[2:54:55.640 --> 2:55:00.000]  local US attorney in this case Jesse Lou could make her own determination the other area
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:06.120]  where that's not true is high profile political cases those have to be approved and authorized
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:10.760]  by the number two at the Department of Justice the deputy attorney general that's why Rosenstein
[2:55:10.760 --> 2:55:16.440]  was such a key person to control all this so when Rosenstein was finally out then that
[2:55:16.440 --> 2:55:22.040]  allowed it looks like the number two currently they have his name here yeah because actually
[2:55:22.040 --> 2:55:26.960]  he talks about is Jeffrey Rosen not Rosenstein and so now all that happens is what happens
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:31.440]  is Lou decided she was going to recommend prosecution that's the only reason why Rosen
[2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:35.040]  would be involved that means Lou has already decided to prosecute him but because you're
[2:55:35.040 --> 2:55:39.800]  confirming from the way this is laid out that the decision to prosecute McCabe is here exactly
[2:55:39.800 --> 2:55:44.280]  the Justice Department is going to prosecute the former acting head of the FBI a first
[2:55:44.280 --> 2:55:49.360]  this is a big deal it's unprecedented and I'm not having a victory lap but my endorphins
[2:55:49.360 --> 2:55:53.960]  are coming out I'm having some pleasure right now because it feels like I'm getting these
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:56:03.560]  demons more off my back and all this hard work starting to pay off oh oh this oh oh oh should
[2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:08.360]  I be feeling this good run absolutely everyone should feel good because this is the first
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:13.960]  time the sort of deep state is faced a threat since Mark felt former deep throat was indicted
[2:56:13.960 --> 2:56:18.760]  for his co-intel pro activities in the late 1970s and then he got he got off the hook
[2:56:18.760 --> 2:56:24.920]  entire so here you have while Trump is president the leading orchestrator of deep state activities
[2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:29.440]  who has more intel and information about what was happening with spy gate what was happening
[2:56:29.440 --> 2:56:34.320]  with Comey what was happening with Brennan what was happening with clapper what was happening
[2:56:34.320 --> 2:56:38.240]  with the Clinton Foundation what was happening with a Clinton email investigation than anyone
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:43.200]  in the entire government is now going to be indicted in the District of Columbia he's
[2:56:43.200 --> 2:56:49.000]  going to face meaningful prosecution please stay there we got a break the endorphin okay
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:53.480]  I don't have a lot of these because we were always fighting the enemy but I'm having some

[2:59:42.120 --> 3:00:00.920]  September 10th you're listening to the alex jones show count down ladies and gentlemen
[3:00:00.920 --> 3:00:08.000]  and room K decision has been made to indict him exactly the breaking news today is that
[3:00:08.000 --> 3:00:13.520]  attorney u.s. attorney jesse luke has chosen and decided already has made the referral
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:18.960]  and the referral has been approved and authorized to indict andrew mccabe the former director
[3:00:18.960 --> 3:00:24.040]  of the fbi the former deputy director of the fbi the key decision maker in the clinton
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:29.320]  email case the clinton foundation case the orchestrator of the spy gate and coup attempts
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:33.460]  against the president of the united states for his false statements to the fbi for his
[3:00:33.460 --> 3:00:38.120]  false statements to the office of inspector general for his illicit leaks to the media
[3:00:38.120 --> 3:00:41.960]  for his attempts to illicitly spy on the president of the united states all of that
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:45.920]  is going to be the basis and the reason and the predicate for an indictment the first
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:50.760]  ever indictment against an acting director of the fbi who had ever been in any high ranking
[3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:55.600]  position in the fbi it's an extraordinary case where the first deep state indictment
[3:00:55.600 --> 3:01:01.200]  really since mark felt in the late 1970s who ran co-intel pro and was known as deep throat
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:06.040]  who secretly took out the nixon administration this is that's how significant and consequential
[3:01:06.040 --> 3:01:10.640]  this indictment is because the way the process works is there's a doctrine called the delegation
[3:01:10.640 --> 3:01:15.640]  doctrine it's a constitutional process about who has the approval and who has the authority
[3:01:15.640 --> 3:01:20.400]  to indict while a grand jury has an indict only a u.s. attorney can bring that case to
[3:01:20.400 --> 3:01:25.360]  the grand jury for the purposes of an indictment and the way that works is the u.s. if if it's
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:30.000]  a particular kind of case tax case has to go to a particular u.s. attorney in charge of
[3:01:30.000 --> 3:01:34.720]  the tax division if it's a certain kind of political case involving a high ranking government
[3:01:34.720 --> 3:01:39.720]  official then it has to be approved of by the deputy director the deputy u.s. attorney
[3:01:39.720 --> 3:01:44.240]  the number two in the united states department of justice which is jeffrey rosen today it's
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:48.360]  reported that he has approved it that means the indictment is coming within days within
[3:01:48.360 --> 3:01:53.400]  weeks andrew mccabe will be indicted by the department of justice for his crimes against
[3:01:53.400 --> 3:01:56.960]  the president united states and on behalf of the clinton family and against the voters
[3:01:56.960 --> 3:02:03.360]  of this country in our electoral system in our republic and this aura of invincibility
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:09.560]  of infallibility of the clinton crime machine and the obama crime machine will then evaporate
[3:02:09.560 --> 3:02:15.840]  and you'll start seeing many others turn state evidence very very quickly this is a giant
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:20.880]  moment for the republic this is approaching the level of when the british sued for peace
[3:02:20.880 --> 3:02:28.960]  uh 240 years ago this is so massive ladies and gentlemen and you're gonna see major
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:33.280]  counter strikes though i suspect if they ever gonna try to kill trump or ever try to stage
[3:02:33.280 --> 3:02:37.920]  a big terror attack or something this is when the deep state is about to fire all barrels
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:42.640]  well in fact i would say that this message is partially that because apparently the source
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:48.040]  for this story coming out is mccabe himself it's mccabe's legal team sending the message
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:53.440]  by the way i'm about to get targeted i'm about to get hit so it's a peculiar kind of timing
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:57.800]  if i was mccabe's people i wouldn't necessarily put this out to the public now he did raise
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:03:04.200]  almost seven hundred thousand dollars for a legal defense fund uh and earlier so maybe
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:08.640]  he's planning on doing a fundraiser what about arkansas what about his family getting live
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:14.000]  insurance on him and i think this guy has his much uh longevity and a shelf life of
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:17.960]  a jeffrey epstein well there's two things about mccabe he has made clear to everybody
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:23.000]  for a long time that he'll rat out anybody and everybody to save his own eye that's
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:27.400]  number one number two he's the source of letting everybody know hey by the way he's about to
[3:03:27.400 --> 3:03:32.440]  get indicted uh so that's a very sort of peculiar thing to do if you want to protect yourself
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:36.720]  the third aspect with him is that if you're an insurance company would you sign would
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:40.000]  you give life insurance right now to andrew mccabe without some special exceptions for
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:44.280]  unusual and unexplained deaths kayak accidents yeah i'd say look you know we will ensure
[3:03:44.280 --> 3:03:48.400]  you heart attacks slipping and it will ensure you as long as your death can be fully and
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:53.840]  completely explained but any unexplained deaths sorry no insurance for that no sudden uh you
[3:03:53.840 --> 3:03:58.800]  know weird ways of car wrecks yeah no car wrecks no weird way no sudden heart unexplained
[3:03:58.800 --> 3:04:04.360]  heart no falling downstairs yeah exactly none of that the no committing suicide while you're
[3:04:04.360 --> 3:04:09.760]  temporarily in federal custody under a video camera nothing like that so the uh the it
[3:04:09.760 --> 3:04:14.080]  will be interesting to see now that he does have intel and information literally on everybody
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:17.200]  i mean if you wanted to talk about a deep state hatchet man with all the information
[3:04:17.200 --> 3:04:22.280]  and intel it is andrew mccabe covered up with the clinton's the foundation he ran the emails
[3:04:22.280 --> 3:04:25.800]  ran the counter espionage unit so i mean you're talking to a guy who knows everything about
[3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:31.080]  peter strozik knows everything about everybody and had access to all the panopticonic big
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:36.720]  tech surveillance grids and everything else and other stuff soup other white chubu about

[3:06:52.160 --> 3:06:55.480]  com from fox news and i'm not telling drudge what to do because it is the big showdown
[3:06:55.480 --> 3:07:02.080]  of elizabeth warren and biden that's a big top story but not compared to that fox news
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:07.080]  one right there below it because the way fox writes it you're not sure what's really being
[3:07:07.080 --> 3:07:12.960]  said there u.s attorney recommends proceeding with charges against mccabe as doj rejects
[3:07:12.960 --> 3:07:18.120]  last ditch appeal that following how the process works i knew what it meant and then i asked
[3:07:18.120 --> 3:07:24.240]  robert barnes a famous criminal lawyer and he laid out exactly what it meant if you just
[3:07:24.240 --> 3:07:28.960]  joined us so let's play the fox news piece that doesn't quite get it right and then we'll
[3:07:28.960 --> 3:07:36.800]  lay out why this is so big the decision has been made to prosecute him it's on this isn't
[3:07:36.800 --> 3:07:40.880]  a court appeal this is an appeal to the deputy attorney general this is the first time an
[3:07:40.880 --> 3:07:45.320]  fbi director because he was acting at the director has been indicted this means no more

[3:08:05.240 --> 3:08:08.600]  least we're going to go down fighting and i say we have the initiative and history on
[3:08:08.600 --> 3:08:13.640]  our side and all these slack jaws that bought the propaganda and signed on to the anti-american
[3:08:13.640 --> 3:08:19.560]  crap they're going to feel like fools when they lose this is a very serious time for
[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:24.080]  our country and the poison injected into us by the globalists of hollywood it's a pyrrhic
[3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:27.920]  victory unless we get god again and reverse what's happening because we may beat the try
[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:33.080]  coms we probably will but can we then not crawl off from the poison already injected
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:37.520]  in us and die as a society from corruption later here's the fox news report then we'll
[3:08:37.520 --> 3:08:42.880]  have constitutional criminal lawyer robert barnes decide for it here it is my business
[3:08:42.880 --> 3:08:49.560]  is investigations evidence finding information and exposing that information when when the
[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:54.160]  american public has a right to know it i'm not a political person i'm not a political
[3:08:54.160 --> 3:09:00.000]  operative right well that was former acting fbi director andrew mccabe claiming he isn't
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:04.840]  political but now the philadelphia inquire is reporting that the disgrace former fbi
[3:09:04.840 --> 3:09:10.520]  official will headline a democrat fundraiser in pennsylvania later this month no not political
[3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:14.840]  at all just raising money for the democrats now remember president trump fired him in
[3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:20.240]  march of twenty eighteen after this i g report came down saying he leaked information to
[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:25.600]  the media wasn't forthcoming about it and the inspector general is still investigating
[3:09:25.600 --> 3:09:30.040]  joining me now joe jennifer former u.s. attorney and jason chaffetz former chair of the house
[3:09:30.040 --> 3:09:36.000]  oversight committee fox news contributor author of the brand new book power grab go grab it
[3:09:36.000 --> 3:09:43.360]  all right joe the mask is really off on mccabe is it not now oh absolutely he and comey have
[3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:48.400]  done irreversible damage to the fbi as an institution but this is not surprising this
[3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:53.880]  is a seamless transition from the private partisan political activities he conducted
[3:09:53.880 --> 3:09:58.480]  with comey and others especially on behalf of his wife who was running for a virginia
[3:09:58.480 --> 3:10:03.760]  senate seat while he was getting hundreds of thousands of dollars for her from a clinton
[3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:09.360]  operative now he's just public with his democratic partisan politics he's a disgrace to the
[3:10:09.360 --> 3:10:15.280]  fbi and he's kind of a pajama boy as you watch him there's something about kind of weekly
[3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:21.000]  masculine about him he's a little strange he doesn't scream mom no but that's the kind
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:24.440]  of people by the way comey surrounded himself would you look at it they're all diminutive
[3:10:24.440 --> 3:10:29.600]  they're weird there's a hundred they're strange they're all strange very very strange those
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:36.280]  are odd jason the fundraiser just in case you want to get your ticket a congressman
[3:10:36.280 --> 3:10:43.400]  is a it's purchased through act blue okay they range from 80 to 160 bucks the more expensive
[3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:48.880]  speaker circles tickets jason come with access to a private reception so if you want to be
[3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:54.520]  lied to to your face you can go to the president's circle of that okay looks like there's still
[3:10:54.520 --> 3:10:59.400]  quite a few tickets left but there's also ones down at 3250 I guess sign get a signed
[3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:05.120]  copy of his book for 3250 this is what of this this is so terribly tone deaf he's on
[3:11:05.120 --> 3:11:10.080]  the receiving end of one of the most scathing IG reports there's ever been there's a at
[3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:17.520]  least two more IG reports that are coming out this is the report of the US Attorney
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:22.520]  recommends proceeding with charges against McCabe as DOJ rejects last-ditch appeal we
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:26.360]  went and checked Barnes is a criminal lawyer he's been following very closely most time
[3:11:26.360 --> 3:11:32.960]  from DC and this this means that they are indeed going forward with a criminal prosecution
[3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:37.520]  indictment you name it and this is going to send shockwaves through we told you this
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:42.880]  was going on last year we told you this year and he's the back man he arrogantly committed
[3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:48.520]  all these crimes he ran this for the Clintons they're letting at least for now comey go
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:53.160]  but by getting McCabe comey has been told by Congress you're still on the crosshairs
[3:11:53.160 --> 3:11:57.640]  how do you expect this to unfold there's a lot of ways it could but this is a big deal
[3:11:57.640 --> 3:12:01.720]  oh yeah I mean first of all this means that he is going to be indicted that's what this
[3:12:01.720 --> 3:12:08.040]  is the way the process works is the the delegation power to choose who gets indicted or who to
[3:12:08.040 --> 3:12:12.080]  the recommendation is the recommendation to the grand jury that's what takes place so
[3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:16.200]  the U.S. attorney says I'm going to recommend the grand jury indict you if you're a if you're
[3:12:16.200 --> 3:12:20.640]  a particular if it's a tax case or you're a high-profile political person it has to
[3:12:20.640 --> 3:12:25.400]  get approved by someone higher up in the Justice Department and tax goes to the tax division
[3:12:25.400 --> 3:12:29.160]  in this case it goes to the deputy the number two under the Department of Justice right
[3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:33.360]  under bar the number two is Jeffrey Rosen and he makes that replace Rosenstein he was
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:37.840]  all giving him carte blanche to commit crimes lying to Trump and saying you're not an investigation
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:42.120]  when he and McCabe were running it exactly so that's why it was that little weasel needs
[3:12:42.120 --> 3:12:48.080]  to be indicted or the long issues with Rosenstein the though I many of my highest profiles wins
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:52.000]  were against cases he made the mistake of recommending but the but the fact that Rosen
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:57.320]  came in and said yes and this is referred and notice he's refers to so the email says
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:13:01.440]  the U.S. attorney's decision in the matter what that means is they've already decided
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:05.320]  to indict Andrew McCabe will be now will now be indicted the only person who could have
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:11.120]  stopped it is is the deputy director he has said no I'm not going to stop it it is full
[3:13:11.120 --> 3:13:14.920]  throttle with the U.S. attorney's office and so quote that administrative appeal failed
[3:13:14.920 --> 3:13:20.160]  exactly and in fact in really what it is is it's not even I wouldn't call it an appeal
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:23.880]  or an administrative what it really is is it's who has the final authority so they the
[3:13:23.880 --> 3:13:27.720]  U.S. attorney said said hey I'm going to go to the grand jury and indict you but under
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:31.400]  the law I don't have that final authority the number two of the Department of Justice
[3:13:31.400 --> 3:13:34.880]  does so you can go to him and so they how long until I mean he he's the one putting
[3:13:34.880 --> 3:13:38.320]  out that he's about to be in doubt how long a week two weeks it could be tomorrow so it
[3:13:38.320 --> 3:13:41.920]  could be tomorrow it could be a several weeks it could be a few months so what will happen
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:46.200]  is it'll depend on when the grand jury meets so they'll walk down to the grand jury and
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:50.720]  when the U.S. attorney's office request the grand jury to indict the grand jury indicts
[3:13:50.720 --> 3:13:57.320]  99.7% of the time so the he is and the feds convict what on this type of deal most of
[3:13:57.320 --> 3:14:01.680]  time so I would look for him to be Arkansas the well be interesting he is in DC so that's
[3:14:01.680 --> 3:14:05.520]  favorable to McCabe oh yeah they even let off the senator with little girls there so
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:09.640]  the you never know if the very democratic bias they've been doing jury nullification
[3:14:09.640 --> 3:14:14.800]  in the case so everybody's gonna be watching this so the the now Lou knows that she's under
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:19.520]  massive pressure to secure a conviction that the credibility of the U.S. Department of
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:25.320]  Justice depends on a successful prosecution of Andrew McCabe but what it also means is
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:29.080]  he has all the intel and all the information he is literally we're gonna come back with
[3:14:29.080 --> 3:14:31.800]  Matt breakfast I want him to take over but I want you to finish with this and we'll get

[3:20:16.280 --> 3:20:20.920]  Andrew McCabe will be indicted that's the headline story coming out of Fox News is Andrew McCabe
[3:20:20.920 --> 3:20:26.160]  himself his counsel apparently is the source leaking out that fact that is already going
[3:20:26.160 --> 3:20:30.440]  to happen what will he be indicted for he'll be indicted for various crimes likely related
[3:20:30.440 --> 3:20:36.040]  to what was in the inspector general Horowitz's report going back almost two years ago report
[3:20:36.040 --> 3:20:41.320]  the detail the ways in which McCabe illicitly leaked to the media lie to the office of inspector
[3:20:41.320 --> 3:20:47.800]  general lied and misled other people within the FBI likely obstructed justice and perverted
[3:20:47.800 --> 3:20:53.520]  the course of justice it may include illicit activities involving illicit partisan activities
[3:20:53.520 --> 3:20:58.880]  on behalf of his wife receiving money from Clinton connected political packs while Clinton
[3:20:58.880 --> 3:21:03.440]  him was under investigation by purportedly Andrew McCabe including the Clinton Foundation
[3:21:03.440 --> 3:21:09.360]  investigation and the Clinton email investigation his complicit role in spy gate his purported
[3:21:09.360 --> 3:21:14.680]  knowledge of Rosenstein's plan to illicitly wiretap the president inside the White House
[3:21:14.680 --> 3:21:19.640]  all of those things can be fully disclosed so you see McCabe's counsel today leaking
[3:21:19.640 --> 3:21:23.880]  this to the press that he's about to get indicted which I can tell you in the past prosecutors
[3:21:23.880 --> 3:21:29.040]  have interpreted as a message to his deep state co-conspirators to start deleting evidence
[3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:33.640]  destroying evidence voluntarily disappearing maybe involuntarily disappearing those people
[3:21:33.640 --> 3:21:37.280]  who won't voluntarily disappear that will be the nature of it if this was a mob case
[3:21:37.280 --> 3:21:41.000]  or any other kind of case that's how the prosecutors would interpret what he's doing he's giving
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:46.360]  a heads up to all of his co-conspirators I'm about to get nailed and run burn everything
[3:21:46.360 --> 3:21:50.840]  exactly that's the message a lot of people would take out of this so the why is just
[3:21:50.840 --> 3:21:55.880]  ask yourself in any situation like this why would McCabe's own counsel leaked to the press
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:22:00.800]  we started apologizing to comey publicly two days ago exactly I mean this is just groveling
[3:22:00.800 --> 3:22:04.520]  well and if I was him I would probably start apologizing to keep deep state members because
[3:22:04.520 --> 3:22:08.440]  he had previously said if he goes down everybody goes down he's so we're lucky to have you
[3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:13.440]  here with the coverage you're going to continue on we'll both be back for sure six to eleven
[3:22:13.440 --> 3:22:17.400]  tonight and you're going to be on showing I already had this decision tonight you're

[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:36.880]  domestic dot com thank you for being here thank you well you know there's an old saying
[3:23:36.880 --> 3:23:43.640]  when you when you move to kill the king you better kill the king because if you don't
[3:23:43.640 --> 3:23:47.560]  the king's got a lot of tools and he's going to track you down you better not take you
[3:23:47.560 --> 3:23:57.680]  out you better not miss well I mean Indra McCabe is the deep state equivalent of Jeffrey Epstein
[3:23:57.680 --> 3:24:02.560]  was on the outside he's the guy with all the intel all the info he's the biggest deep state
[3:24:02.560 --> 3:24:07.880]  indictment in more than 40 years since Mark Felt who ran we can't say how big it is that's
[3:24:07.880 --> 3:24:10.600]  what we're talking about you've been another great point why you're here Matt take over
[3:24:10.600 --> 3:24:14.120]  we love you we're gonna go eat lunch and listen to you God bless you folks spread the word
[3:24:14.120 --> 3:24:18.160]  about this live feed spread the word about this live feed history is happening right now
[3:24:18.160 --> 3:24:24.600]  folks do it and not video go ahead my friend yeah this is this is the big the big shift
[3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:31.120]  you know visible icebergs are good for a couple of analogies obviously most of an iceberg
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:37.560]  is invisible what we and the in you know just folks out here without inside sources like
[3:24:37.560 --> 3:24:43.800]  you know classified sources what we see is that like 10% of the iceberg but the deep
[3:24:43.800 --> 3:24:50.000]  state players they know much more of what's underneath the water and and so if McCabe
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:54.840]  is starting to panic you know that it's bad and all the rest of the deep state coup plotters
[3:24:54.840 --> 3:25:01.760]  they're gonna be in a panic also and sometimes with an iceberg sometimes they actually capsize
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:06.240]  or you've seen them calving off of a glacier you know when that iceberg it looks so solid
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:12.120]  it looks like a big solid piece of that glacier you know like a cliff like a wall but when
[3:25:12.120 --> 3:25:18.560]  that acre of ice falls off into the fjord it sends out big waves and today we're seeing
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:24.360]  that that one of those icebergs calve off you know that glaciers been moving so slowly
[3:25:24.360 --> 3:25:28.640]  for two years I've been saying when somebody gonna get arrested and dieted you know what
[3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:33.040]  is this one of these coup plotters when is it when is the shoe gonna be on the other
[3:25:33.040 --> 3:25:39.240]  foot well I think that today visibly it's happening you know another couple of analogies
[3:25:39.240 --> 3:25:48.000]  in warfare you can sometimes see a a an army just on the march and it looks like it's unstoppable
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:52.920]  but they reach the end of their they reach their limit they go too far where their their
[3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:57.920]  logistical lines are too over extended their people are worn out maybe they don't have
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:26:03.400]  the right uniforms for the environment I'm thinking of Civil War Lee at Gettysburg you
[3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:07.960]  know hey they're in Pennsylvania the south must be doing great and within a year and
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:15.640]  a half Richmond it's all over or in the Second World War the Nazis got to Stalingrad and
[3:26:15.640 --> 3:26:20.040]  they they're on their way to secure in the Caspian oil fields and that was their high
[3:26:20.040 --> 3:26:26.880]  watermark and then the rest of the way is defense all the way back to Berlin and and Berlin
[3:26:26.880 --> 3:26:32.600]  being crushed the the Red Army just wiping them out all the way back and I think this
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:37.320]  is the turning point one of those days in history when we're gonna see this as an actual
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:45.920]  turning point and I can't wait to see MS DNC and CNN today how they're gonna spin this
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:51.560]  you know the great hero McCabe being being slandered and besmirched by the evil Trump
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:57.640]  Ian corrupt Justice Department it's gonna be a joke it's gonna be like the election
[3:26:57.640 --> 3:27:04.840]  night worth recording to savor over the coming coming weeks and months and when I come back
[3:27:04.840 --> 3:27:10.000]  I'm gonna talk about another angle on this whole deep state coup that's also been ongoing
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:15.680]  this week which is the Mike Flynn case you know this is this is like another battle front
[3:27:15.680 --> 3:27:20.880]  you know while we're dealing with the you know the the Nazis in Europe we got the Japanese
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:28.280]  in the Pacific well this is another front in this deep state counterattack the amazing
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:35.280]  lawyer Sidney Powell has been doing an unbelievable job in court trying to get this Brady material
[3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:41.360]  that's the ex exculpatory material that should have been released that wasn't that the DOJ
[3:27:41.360 --> 3:27:45.520]  even till this day has been hiding you know even with bar in charge there are all these
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:52.200]  deep state moles so deeply embedded that it's just been in almost impossible to drag anything
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:56.960]  out of the Department of Justice but you know Mike Flynn who went bankrupt in his first
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:28:01.920]  go around with his old law firm he should ask for a refund and I believe Sidney Powell
[3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:07.400]  this female attorney you've seen on TV she's actually doing this pro bono so Mike Flynn
[3:28:07.400 --> 3:28:13.480]  went to DC attorneys and I'll bet they were they were actually not working on his behalf
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:18.320]  you know they were taking his money and letting the meter run but were they actually working
[3:28:18.320 --> 3:28:24.040]  for General Flynn or were they working for their you know future business partners and
[3:28:24.040 --> 3:28:29.040]  legal partners in the deep state it really makes you wonder how deep this goes but this
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:35.240]  is a this is going to be a day to savor the the final the final pivot the counterattack
[3:28:35.240 --> 3:28:40.520]  you know when when the Germans get pushed out of Stalingrad and it's back to Berlin
[3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:46.920]  you know this is going to be an epic sea change coming up and we'll have it back more in a

[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:32.480]  okay when we left we were talking about the panic in the deep state and that's exactly
[3:33:32.480 --> 3:33:38.640]  a I think what we're what we're seeing now of McCabe is sending out the signals to his
[3:33:38.640 --> 3:33:44.160]  can be to his buddies the only leverage he's got is to try to warn them you know in other
[3:33:44.160 --> 3:33:49.840]  words please don't kill me I don't feel like going canoeing on the Potomac or driving off
[3:33:49.840 --> 3:33:56.920]  a cliff so forgive me now we've all got to cover our own butts as best we can this is
[3:33:56.920 --> 3:34:02.920]  why for the past couple of months supposedly people have been going back to the inspector
[3:34:02.920 --> 3:34:10.440]  general Horowitz and amending their their testimony you know this is because among the deep state
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:15.440]  plotters you know the rumors will be flying about who's singing like a canary and you
[3:34:15.440 --> 3:34:21.560]  don't want to be holding the short stick because the cons the conspirators all said we won't
[3:34:21.560 --> 3:34:27.280]  say a word or we'll all agree to tell this lie but then you hear one of your co-conspirators
[3:34:27.280 --> 3:34:33.560]  has broken ranks and they're talking to Durham or Horowitz so they're scurrying back to Horowitz
[3:34:33.560 --> 3:34:39.280]  to say you know I had some further memories I remembered things a little bit differently
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:43.560]  this is because they know that they know that the axe is coming down they know that it's
[3:34:43.560 --> 3:34:48.480]  going to happen and there's and there's no stopping it at this point you know something
[3:34:48.480 --> 3:34:57.760]  about corrupt people is that they think everybody is corrupt you know a thief thinks that everybody
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:02.160]  is a thief that they just don't get caught like you know maybe they're a more careful
[3:35:02.160 --> 3:35:08.320]  better thief but thieves liars think that everybody lies you know they they don't think that they're
[3:35:08.320 --> 3:35:14.760]  uniquely sinful they think that all politicians are corrupt if you go and you explore this
[3:35:14.760 --> 3:35:22.200]  cast of characters start with Comey and look at his relationship with Mueller with McCabe
[3:35:22.200 --> 3:35:30.040]  with Rosenstein with former former attorney general Holder and Lynch you'll see that
[3:35:30.040 --> 3:35:37.560]  all of these players have been they went to law school they went to work for the Democrats
[3:35:37.560 --> 3:35:43.360]  to to enrich themselves and to further the power of the Democrat Party and if you look
[3:35:43.360 --> 3:35:49.080]  at it's really interesting to put on a timeline you know where was Mueller where was Comey
[3:35:49.080 --> 3:35:56.120]  where was Lynch where was Holder they take turns of working as US attorneys where they
[3:35:56.120 --> 3:36:02.760]  can throw favors to corporations they take court they take corporate gigs as like senior
[3:36:02.760 --> 3:36:11.880]  senior legal counsel for like HSBC bank for Lockheed Martin and then they they do deals
[3:36:11.880 --> 3:36:17.520]  with their US attorney pals you know they get they get contracts cleared or approved
[3:36:17.520 --> 3:36:22.720]  or they get fines reduced to a slap on the wrist this is how they have functioned so
[3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:31.320]  these are this is a cast of entirely you really evilly corrupt people and finally finally
[3:36:31.320 --> 3:36:36.880]  it looks like there is going to be some level of justice coming down and we might not see
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:43.880]  the justice ourselves there they might have a lot of security in some respects you know
[3:36:43.880 --> 3:36:48.960]  well Epstein thought he was untouchable Epstein thought I've got so many blackmail tapes they'll
[3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:56.880]  never touch me he wound up dead under mysterious circumstances to say the least I think that
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:03.320]  the Rosensteins than the McCaves they probably have in a form of a parachute which is which
[3:37:03.320 --> 3:37:08.920]  is a dead man switch you know if I'm taking out I'm taking all of the rest of these guys
[3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:16.800]  out well to our benefit that can lead to a cascade because all of these all of these
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:24.840]  thumb drives and packages full of information are going to get leaked now furiously because
[3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:29.960]  if you look at some of the conspirators if you look particularly at McCabe Comey and
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:36.640]  Rosenstein they have some very serious contradictions in their testimony there are there are cases
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:41.600]  where one or both of them have to be lying you know that this it's either two plus two
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:48.320]  is four or not and you know if you're caught on the wrong side of a provable lie somebody
[3:37:48.320 --> 3:37:53.200]  is going to testify against somebody else and you can go to jail for perjury you can
[3:37:53.200 --> 3:37:59.600]  absolutely go to jail for perjury and these guys at their ages and you know with the power
[3:37:59.600 --> 3:38:04.600]  that they have accumulated they do not want to see the inside of a jail cell I don't think
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:09.160]  we're going to see any G Gordon Liddy's out of this crowd if you go back to Watergate
[3:38:09.160 --> 3:38:14.400]  G Gordon Liddy was the head of the Watergate plumbers that did the break in but he just
[3:38:14.400 --> 3:38:20.000]  wouldn't talk he took it like a like a POW you know Renee name rank and serial number
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:25.840]  this crew is not going to go the G Gordon Liddy route they are all corrupt evil venal
[3:38:25.840 --> 3:38:32.240]  men and you know with the exception perhaps of Comey and the reason I say that I think
[3:38:32.240 --> 3:38:38.760]  that Comey is not corrupt financially of course he did do the you know gigs at like Lockheed
[3:38:38.760 --> 3:38:44.120]  Martin and HSBC where you make three or four million in a year for approving corrupt deals
[3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:50.400]  or or look in the other way for uranium one deals things like that but I think he's a
[3:38:50.400 --> 3:38:57.080]  true believer until recently his Twitter handle was Reinhold Niebuhr and Reinhold Niebuhr
[3:38:57.080 --> 3:39:02.720]  is a 20th century quote unquote theologian who preached you know that Jesus was the
[3:39:02.720 --> 3:39:09.360]  first Marxist basically so Comey's book is called a higher loyalty meaning a higher loyalty
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:16.200]  than then to the oath that I took to you know defend the Constitution obey the law his higher
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:24.360]  loyalty is to further the goal of globalism socialism and to me they're just synonyms
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:30.480]  for communism so I think Comey out of this whole crew he might fall on his sword he'll
[3:39:30.480 --> 3:39:37.640]  just you know take Twitter pictures of himself staring at the in the woods but but you know
[3:39:37.640 --> 3:39:42.240]  it's not going to help him because in the end the structs in the pages they're not
[3:39:42.240 --> 3:39:48.160]  going to be willing to go to jail to protect the their higher ups you know the the the
[3:39:48.160 --> 3:39:54.200]  Carlins and the bakers and the McCabe's and the Rosensteins all of these people have guilty
[3:39:54.200 --> 3:40:00.400]  knowledge on one another they all do and when they're all individually you know put under
[3:40:00.400 --> 3:40:05.800]  oath and deposed they're going to spill their guts there because they don't know what other
[3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:11.400]  people have said so their only defense is going to be completely let it out let it
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:17.120]  spill and everybody the devil take the hind most everybody is going to be out for self
[3:40:17.120 --> 3:40:23.440]  preservation and at the end of the day I I hope you know maybe I'm just having a good
[3:40:23.440 --> 3:40:28.440]  day and I'm pretty naive but I hope we see that some of these people see the inside of
[3:40:28.440 --> 3:40:34.960]  a prison cell and I'm thinking at the very top you know you've got the communist Brennan
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:39.840]  how did he become the head of the CIA I mean you you know it really bears studying all
[3:40:39.840 --> 3:40:45.600]  of these guys I go back to Diana West amazing book the Red Thread you know how did these
[3:40:45.600 --> 3:40:52.040]  guys wind up in charge of the seventh floor of the FBI every night Hannity says you know
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:57.840]  99% of the FBI there is pure as the driven snow they're great patriots it's just that
[3:40:57.840 --> 3:41:04.920]  somehow you know that bad 1% wound up in charge of FBI headquarters I don't believe it I think
[3:41:04.920 --> 3:41:11.000]  that that we're going to see a generational struggle now so even though we've had a battlefield
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:17.960]  win today and we might even win you know part of a war if we want if we you know if we root
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:23.560]  out this deep state coup and we see some of these guys thrown in prison that's not going
[3:41:23.560 --> 3:41:29.720]  to end it because as I've been saying for quite a while now college output is federal
[3:41:29.720 --> 3:41:36.520]  government input if college is turning out you know Marxist social justice warriors guess
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:43.560]  what that's who's entering the FBI that's who's going into the DOJ that's how these corrupt
[3:41:43.560 --> 3:41:49.520]  Democrat operatives you know like like Holder Lynch all of these that's how they've risen
[3:41:49.520 --> 3:41:56.280]  so fast and so far through the Department of Justice the entire edifice is just worm
[3:41:56.280 --> 3:42:01.920]  eaten you know with to me I'll call them communists they can say they're progressives with a higher
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:09.280]  loyalty I call them communists and even though we may have a battlefield victory here today
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:15.640]  I don't think that it's over by a long shot because for the next you know 20 30 years
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:21.840]  the people that that thought Brennan should be allowed into the CIA and then opened the
[3:42:21.840 --> 3:42:27.880]  doors for him all the way through to director of the CIA they are still the same people
[3:42:27.880 --> 3:42:34.960]  that are selecting tomorrow's FBI agents and CIA CIA case officers those are the people
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:40.520]  that are supposed to defend us that actually they they see a higher loyalty also they don't
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:46.600]  believe that both that we took to defend the Constitution their higher loyalty is to globalism
[3:42:46.600 --> 3:42:52.720]  and it's going to be a long long war here before we end this happiness is a tincture

[3:45:57.680 --> 3:46:04.160]  blackmail ring using pedophilia I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:08.840]  organ harvesting I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive
[3:46:08.840 --> 3:46:14.000]  after they were born for their organs to be harvested I was the first to warn you along
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:19.400]  with Paul Watson and infowars.com 15 years ago that Google was using microphones and
[3:46:19.400 --> 3:46:26.560]  hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues
[3:46:26.560 --> 3:46:31.200]  like the Federal Reserve being private run for profit trying to control our economy that
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:35.400]  our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one
[3:46:35.400 --> 3:46:40.200]  of these issues and many others we've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on a planetary
[3:46:40.200 --> 3:46:45.640]  scale that's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more
[3:46:45.640 --> 3:46:55.960]  critical than ever to support the info war please support the info war however you can
[3:46:55.960 --> 3:47:19.960]  we're listening to the Alex Jones show waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones with Matt
[3:47:19.960 --> 3:47:26.960]  Bracken
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:43.680]  okay now obviously the cave news is dominating everything today and it's very important you
[3:47:43.680 --> 3:47:49.840]  know it's it's the it's the rock in the river that the river is bending around today but
[3:47:49.840 --> 3:47:56.120]  it relates to a lot of other big picture items and I think that it's what it what's happening
[3:47:56.120 --> 3:48:02.880]  now is that the the deep states time timeline their narrative so time cycle it's been very
[3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:09.400]  disrupted so we're going to see some unexpected events that are going to come out of the blue
[3:48:09.400 --> 3:48:14.840]  but maybe not so out of the blue that because of this panic among the deep state the key
[3:48:14.840 --> 3:48:23.560]  deep state players now the plan was to pivot from Russian collusion the hoax which occupied
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:28.640]  mainstream media for two straight years plus two and a half years the plan was to just
[3:48:28.640 --> 3:48:35.120]  never mind that you know leave that go away from that and and pivot to the new narrative
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:42.400]  that you know white man bad orange man bad you know that the the former American patriots
[3:48:42.400 --> 3:48:49.240]  now are the most dangerous terrorists in America and the world you know the dreaded white nationalists
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:59.640]  you know anybody who is of European heritage who is a national patriot is today a white
[3:48:59.640 --> 3:49:05.080]  nationalist and we know what that means it means that they've got a Nazi uniform hidden
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:13.800]  in their closet so this was the long-term plan for the the progressive deep state operatives
[3:49:13.800 --> 3:49:21.760]  was to just you know like a magician misdirecting never mind the Russian coup we've now got
[3:49:21.760 --> 3:49:27.200]  an even bigger threat you know looming over the horizon which is the rise of the the evil
[3:49:27.200 --> 3:49:34.960]  alt-right white nationalists i saw i saw a video today it's on bit shoot and youtube there's
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:42.360]  a videographer out named it was a brit in north england named iconoclast and i put him
[3:49:42.360 --> 3:49:48.360]  easily at the at the top tier with paul joes of watson and black pigeon speaks if you've
[3:49:48.360 --> 3:49:54.280]  never seen iconoclast i highly recommend him now he was he was in a purge about two or
[3:49:54.280 --> 3:50:00.600]  three weeks ago he was banned for a couple of days and then brought back he has like
[3:50:00.600 --> 3:50:07.280]  200 000 followers his videos get seen millions of times it's his video today is brilliant
[3:50:07.280 --> 3:50:14.400]  you know he's a an european he's english and he's a patriot so the way he is now referred
[3:50:14.400 --> 3:50:20.880]  to in the bbc and the and you know the guardian and other left-wing british rags is as an
[3:50:20.880 --> 3:50:29.960]  european white nationalist you know an extremist and all he is is an english patriot i mean
[3:50:29.960 --> 3:50:36.240]  so his video today starts out saying what if you woke up and on tv all the npc bots are
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:41.680]  saying the sky is green the sky has always been green and if you say no it's blue you're
[3:50:41.680 --> 3:50:49.160]  a skyist you're like holding on to outdated bigoted ideas anyway the video is is really
[3:50:49.160 --> 3:50:55.480]  terrific it's called the mainstream media lies and lies about demography and smears
[3:50:55.480 --> 3:51:01.320]  me you know that you can't even talk now about on youtube about the great replacement if you
[3:51:01.320 --> 3:51:09.440]  say great replacement on youtube automatically you're banned so if you don't support mass
[3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:16.760]  third world immigration into this country you're automatically next door to being a nazi now
[3:51:16.760 --> 3:51:22.680]  again more good news like the news on mccabe's coming indictment the supreme court slapped
[3:51:22.680 --> 3:51:29.160]  down seven to two this absurd notion that anybody from anywhere in the world can come
[3:51:29.160 --> 3:51:35.480]  through you know a dozen countries buses airplanes show up at the american border and claim asylum
[3:51:35.480 --> 3:51:42.080]  so that's definitely another a battlefield victory but it's nothing to gloat about because
[3:51:42.080 --> 3:51:47.640]  you know we're being swamped demographically what happened in california over the last
[3:51:47.640 --> 3:51:53.840]  you know 20 30 years is happening in states like north carolina why is it even in play
[3:51:53.840 --> 3:52:00.200]  because of demography you know we've got an unbelievable explosion of third world immigrants
[3:52:00.200 --> 3:52:07.040]  into sanctuary cities and states where they're given drivers licenses which are motor voter
[3:52:07.040 --> 3:52:11.440]  and nobody checks to see if they're voting this is what happened to california and it's
[3:52:11.440 --> 3:52:16.920]  happening right across the country so we've had a victory today with the asylum ruling
[3:52:16.920 --> 3:52:23.160]  and i hope that trump can can push it they're putting these asylum judges on intense right
[3:52:23.160 --> 3:52:28.320]  at the border and get right out the solution to this is to throw the problem back to mexico
[3:52:28.320 --> 3:52:32.160]  and say they're not coming into our country so you might want to deal with it at your
[3:52:32.160 --> 3:52:38.000]  southern border otherwise you're going to have permanent refugee camps in northern mexico
[3:52:38.000 --> 3:52:45.480]  we're not letting them in but because of the mccabe news today this this um racial identity
[3:52:45.480 --> 3:52:52.080]  politics long-term narrative this this pivot from you know trump is a russian agent to
[3:52:52.080 --> 3:52:59.520]  now trump is the arch racist what's happened with mccabe is that a giant boulder almost
[3:52:59.520 --> 3:53:05.920]  an asteroid has landed in the pond and they don't have time for a long pivot towards
[3:53:05.920 --> 3:53:11.720]  uh you know red flag laws banning guns this is going to take too long they need something
[3:53:11.720 --> 3:53:18.480]  to take the exposure of the deep state coup right off the front page and and my worry
[3:53:18.480 --> 3:53:24.520]  is that we're going to see uh some kind of terrorist attack it seems to happen when they
[3:53:24.520 --> 3:53:30.000]  need it now i'm not saying that that uh one of these deep state coup plotters is going
[3:53:30.000 --> 3:53:37.600]  to you know pick up a telephone um or or his smartphone and then leave all these fingerprints
[3:53:37.600 --> 3:53:43.280]  to some parallax view corporation where they've where they're going to uh you know set out
[3:53:43.280 --> 3:53:49.120]  on a patsy i don't think that's how it works i think that it's more like the way that insects
[3:53:49.120 --> 3:53:54.720]  communicate with pheromones or jellyfish you know with vibrations in the water they all
[3:53:54.720 --> 3:54:00.880]  can turn at the same time even though they have no brains and we're going to see somebody
[3:54:00.880 --> 3:54:09.480]  like the odessa lunatic or the parkland lunatic somebody who is is these deep state players
[3:54:09.480 --> 3:54:15.000]  are aware of and i'm not saying at a high level but when all of these pheromones signals
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:21.640]  these panic signals go out it's like kicking over a fire ant nest you know way in the way
[3:54:21.640 --> 3:54:26.480]  in the bottom of the fire ant nest they all come out even if somebody just pokes a stick
[3:54:26.480 --> 3:54:32.920]  at the top and that's all done by chemical pheromones well in this in this form of communication
[3:54:32.920 --> 3:54:39.040]  the panic signals are going to go out we need a major distraction so i wouldn't be surprised
[3:54:39.040 --> 3:54:44.880]  if we see something coming up in the next days to weeks to get the whole mccabe deep
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:50.120]  state coup indictment off of the out of the news something it's going to last a long time
[3:54:50.120 --> 3:54:56.680]  and i'm i'm just becoming aware now of something happening in new york on the 28th of september
[3:54:56.680 --> 3:55:03.480]  i'm not making any predictions here but they're promoting this on network tv big time just
[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:09.800]  imagine if this was like a a patriotic american rally hell no it's called it's called the
[3:55:09.800 --> 3:55:19.920]  global citizen festival in new york with big a name list of a list acts going to be free
[3:55:19.920 --> 3:55:26.440]  tickets free everything can you imagine what it cost to put this on and to promote it one
[3:55:26.440 --> 3:55:32.120]  you know globally not nationally at least they're going to give free tickets to this
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:37.920]  event and it's basically going to be a commie fest okay it's going to be you know no borders
[3:55:37.920 --> 3:55:43.600]  no walls no usa at all that's going to be the message so you can bet that the antifa
[3:55:43.600 --> 3:55:48.880]  pink hat those guys are going to be there on mass they are going to be there on mass
[3:55:48.880 --> 3:55:56.920]  and what would be a better event for for you know an alleged you know right wing you know
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:56:03.560]  alt right white nationalist to disrupt either something like that will be blamed on a group
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:10.000]  like the proud boys you know with um fights down at ground level or something much worse
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:17.720]  like the las vegas event of two years ago and something that is going to be blamed on
[3:56:17.720 --> 3:56:24.600]  the conservatives the alt right the gun owners the second amendment and something that will
[3:56:24.600 --> 3:56:32.680]  sweep mccabe and the deep state coup come up and write off of the of the media so i'm
[3:56:32.680 --> 3:56:38.160]  not making any prediction but if i was a you know if i was um in the security business
[3:56:38.160 --> 3:56:44.440]  for the government i'd be very concerned about this uh commie fest global commie fest in
[3:56:44.440 --> 3:56:51.360]  new york on the 28th because it would be the absolute perfect venue to blame on uh you
[3:56:51.360 --> 3:56:57.560]  know conservative quote unquote quote unquote white nationalists if something detonated
