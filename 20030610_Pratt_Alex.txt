[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900]  About 30 minutes and he joins us now, we're about to break.
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.000]  But Larry, what are some of the things we're going to be talking about in the next 30 minutes here on the air?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.600]  Well Alex, one of the things that strikes me as peculiar is the greater amount of firearms freedoms being allowed
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.800]  people of Iraq compared to the folks in the United States by the same administration.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.200]  Well they haven't gotten them trained yet like they have us.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.800]  They're telling them just, first they said hand them in, they wouldn't show.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.000]  Okay, just let us register those.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.200]  The Iraqis are saying in their news, you want to take them, we know what you'll do.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.400]  You know these guys may have had a tough life but that didn't make them stupid.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.200]  Exactly.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:50.400]  That strikes me as hopefully something that's going to enable us to kill the renewal of the semi-auto ban.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.200]  The disparity is so clear.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.200]  In Iraq we're talking about actual military full-auto machine gun AK-47.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.600]  In the United States we're talking about semi-auto firearms that have never been used by any military in the world.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.600]  Well we'll talk about the new Bush, Clinton, Schumer assault weapons ban they want to reauthorize.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.000]  And my surprise at the NRA two weeks ago finally doing an analysis of the legislative center
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600]  that could have been written by gun owners of America
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.000]  admitting the ban on semi-automatic shotguns and all that.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.800]  I want to get your take on NRA members forcing them and gun owners members forcing them to finally tell some of the truth.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.800]  And I also want to talk about Canada, many of their provinces refusing to turn their guns in.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.600]  Okay Larry?
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.400]  Very good.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.000]  Fantastic.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.800]  Gunowners.org is the website.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.200]  Link through at Infowars.com.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt who we're honored to have on the show bearing the standard for the second amendment.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:01:48.215 --> 00:02:17.935]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:02:17.935 --> 00:02:22.855]  All right, folks, we're talking to Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.
[00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:28.695]  Be sure and visit GunOwners.org, also be sure and go to Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:35.175]  Get my new video, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, it gets into gun control, the new Clinton
[00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:39.935]  slash Bush, Chuck E. Schumer assault weapons ban, and we get into the whole police state
[00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:47.415]  and Patriot Act 1 and 2, and rumors of Patriot Act 3, we've confirmed Patriot Act 2.
[00:02:47.415 --> 00:02:51.695]  It is an amazing film, dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:02:51.695 --> 00:03:02.575]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to get the new film, Percoltole Free, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:10.775]  That's 888-253-3139, and I authorize my listeners to make copies of my videos for nonprofit
[00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:15.635]  not-for-sale purposes to spread the word and to use the power of the grassroots to educate
[00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:20.715]  the people about what we're really facing, so take action to get the new film today.
[00:03:20.715 --> 00:03:25.915]  Larry Pratt, before we get into Iraqis having more freedom with guns than Americans, and
[00:03:25.915 --> 00:03:31.395]  before we get into Canada, and it's most of its states, its provinces saying, no, we're
[00:03:31.395 --> 00:03:36.555]  not going to turn our guns in, and before we get into the new assault weapons ban by
[00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:42.954]  Hare Bush and the liberals and the neo-cons, Patriot Act 1 and 2, your lawyers wrote an
[00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:47.875]  incredible 20-plus page analysis of it, even scarier than mine.
[00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.835]  You found stuff I didn't find, I found stuff you didn't find in it, the secret arrests
[00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:57.355]  of citizens, the secret executions, the guns being crimes, all of this garbage.
[00:03:57.355 --> 00:04:02.155]  Ashcroft said there wasn't a Patriot Act 2 before Congress two months ago.
[00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:06.475]  Now last Thursday he admitted it, there is an expansion of it.
[00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:10.675]  Your response, your analysis of the Patriot Act, and why do you think Ashcroft had to
[00:04:10.675 --> 00:04:11.675]  admit this?
[00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:19.395]  I believe he had to admit it because the grassroots is afire with this, interestingly both on
[00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:23.595]  the left and on the right, but the left doesn't really have much of a grassroots, so when
[00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:29.995]  you're talking about grassroots you're really talking about folks like us, and the input
[00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:36.075]  to Congress is picking up, the opposition being expressed to the White House is picking
[00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:40.635]  up because more and more people are finding out about this stuff, and they can't believe
[00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:42.914]  that, oh no, here we go again.
[00:04:42.914 --> 00:04:47.755]  So the best defense is an offense, he launched and said, yeah, I don't apologize for the
[00:04:47.755 --> 00:04:52.835]  first one, tried to make it an illegal alien issue knowing we're against open borders when
[00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:57.395]  it's not really about that, a red herring there, and saying I want more, not only do
[00:04:57.395 --> 00:04:59.914]  I defend the first one, I want more.
[00:04:59.914 --> 00:05:05.034]  We do have to take the offense on this for a very important reason.
[00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:11.755]  Even though there is officially no such proposal on the table as H.R. such and such with a
[00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:20.275]  bill number, this thing is what I would term opportunistically poised, what would be the
[00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:27.475]  next terrorist tragedy striking us would be an opportunity for them, and we've got to
[00:05:27.475 --> 00:05:33.155]  make it as clear as we possibly can before that opportunity quote unquote arises to let
[00:05:33.195 --> 00:05:40.914]  the elected officials know that we don't want you to do anything if the next crisis except
[00:05:40.914 --> 00:05:45.155]  make it easier for us to defend ourselves, but for goodness sakes, we don't want you
[00:05:45.155 --> 00:05:48.715]  to pass another bill concentrating more power in Washington.
[00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:50.675]  You've already gone too far.
[00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:56.315]  Let what you've got expire, and now they're also trying to get rid of the sunset as you
[00:05:56.315 --> 00:06:01.235]  just said, but already in the first Patriot Act, the key provisions like 213, the sneak
[00:06:01.275 --> 00:06:07.595]  and peek and others and the expanded definition of terrorism, Section 802, those are not sunset
[00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:11.115]  and Larry, this is their incredible spin.
[00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:13.355]  I've written an analysis of Patriot Act two.
[00:06:13.355 --> 00:06:14.355]  We have a copy of it.
[00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:18.275]  The legislative control sheet was brought by the Justice Department and Dennis Hastert
[00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:23.155]  brought to him secretly and to Dick Cheney, but that's the red herring of the House bill.
[00:06:23.155 --> 00:06:24.755]  It has been introduced.
[00:06:24.755 --> 00:06:28.955]  The House version is the Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:32.635]  The House version was introduced six months ago in January.
[00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:35.835]  It is the Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[00:06:35.835 --> 00:06:39.995]  It has all the same provisions under different subsections as the House bill.
[00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:44.075]  It has been enrolled, and in it, it has added gun control.
[00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:50.034]  It is sponsored by the worst Democrats on the Hill, so I might point you to S22.
[00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:54.794]  Well, S22 definitely is the mother of all gun control bills.
[00:06:54.794 --> 00:07:00.554]  It's got everything short of a ban that they would love to have.
[00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:07.755]  It is the Brady campaign shopping list, and of course, in moments of crisis, they can
[00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:13.235]  easily tack on anything that they might have left out to see if they can't slip that through
[00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:14.554]  as well.
[00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:20.955]  I think that's the great danger and that we've just got to be doing our work now.
[00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:26.034]  What is so wonderful about the members of Gun Owners of America is that they have been
[00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:28.635]  so tenacious and so persistent.
[00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:34.914]  They remind me of the widow in Luke 18 who went before an unrighteous judge.
[00:07:34.914 --> 00:07:36.914]  Times don't change.
[00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:42.155]  He blew her off because she was a nobody, and he didn't think that he had to give her
[00:07:42.155 --> 00:07:43.155]  anything.
[00:07:43.155 --> 00:07:47.515]  Well, a lot of folks would say, well, gee, I guess if the government said so, it must
[00:07:47.515 --> 00:07:51.875]  be legitimate, and then and now, most people would have just walked away.
[00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:55.995]  But the widow knew that what she wanted, whatever it was, was right, and she persisted.
[00:07:55.995 --> 00:08:01.395]  And finally, the unrighteous judge gave her what she wants, saying, and this is the quote
[00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:08.235]  from the scripture, she troubles me, and if we don't trouble them, I guarantee you they're
[00:08:08.235 --> 00:08:09.235]  going to trouble us.
[00:08:09.235 --> 00:08:10.635]  Well, that's it.
[00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:14.794]  We've got to keep their feet to the fire, but this is curious.
[00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:16.235]  I've done a lot of talk show interviews.
[00:08:16.235 --> 00:08:19.395]  You probably do as many as I do or more, Larry.
[00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:23.075]  And I've been on conservative talk shows, and I'll say Bush says he's going to reauthorize
[00:08:23.075 --> 00:08:27.275]  the assault weapons ban, and they'll say that's not true.
[00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:31.855]  And then they'll say you're a liberal making up information to discredit Bush.
[00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:37.715]  Why do we see, I don't see this widespread, but I do see pockets of it, massive denial
[00:08:37.715 --> 00:08:42.595]  by so many conservatives through the neocon agenda we see in Washington?
[00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:49.855]  I think denial is a very major and consistent human problem that we all have to deal with
[00:08:49.855 --> 00:08:53.275]  at one time or another about one thing or another.
[00:08:53.275 --> 00:08:59.835]  If something just seems too horrible to think about, you just, wow, that couldn't happen
[00:08:59.835 --> 00:09:00.835]  here.
[00:09:00.835 --> 00:09:03.835]  No government in the United States would ever become tyrannical.
[00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:08.715]  Well, ask a bunch of Germans that, what they thought in 1930 and then what they thought
[00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:09.715]  in 1940.
[00:09:10.035 --> 00:09:13.115]  You know, a lot can change in a very short period of time.
[00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:18.475]  And to say that it can't happen here is, to a certain extent, I suppose, a lazy man's
[00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:19.475]  way of dealing with it.
[00:09:19.475 --> 00:09:21.515]  If it can't happen, then I don't have to deal with it.
[00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:25.515]  I don't have to do anything, and therefore I don't even need to ask for an excuse.
[00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:30.995]  Well, Larry, it is happening here, and we've got a unified front by the Hillary Clintons,
[00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:37.395]  the Chucky Schumers, with Bush on open borders, on gun control, on NAFTA and GATT, on all
[00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:42.475]  these key issues, on protecting Bill Clinton, blocking Dan Burton's committee.
[00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:47.435]  Ari Fleischer, the press secretary, a couple weeks ago told a WorldNetDaily reporter, when
[00:09:47.435 --> 00:09:51.755]  they brought up Hardingate, how Bush is protecting Clinton, he said, the president's moving forward
[00:09:51.755 --> 00:09:54.595]  and he suggests you do the same.
[00:09:54.595 --> 00:10:01.515]  Let me point back to the gun issue and the semi-auto ban just for a minute, because some
[00:10:01.515 --> 00:10:05.995]  people will acknowledge that they've heard the president, spokesman anyway, say that
[00:10:06.075 --> 00:10:10.075]  that's what he wants to do, to renew the ban, keep it on the books.
[00:10:10.075 --> 00:10:13.075]  They'll say, well, but hey, you don't have to worry about that.
[00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:15.075]  The House of Representatives isn't going to vote for that.
[00:10:15.075 --> 00:10:16.075]  It's under control.
[00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:18.075]  Well, part of that's true.
[00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:22.075]  I don't think the House of Representatives is where we're going to get clobbered.
[00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:24.075]  But here's how it can happen.
[00:10:24.075 --> 00:10:26.075]  It's already happened this way in the past.
[00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:31.075]  When Lautenberg put his gun ban in, greatly expanding the number of prohibited people
[00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:38.155]  that are allowed to own a gun in this country, people that have had domestic violence misdemeanors,
[00:10:38.155 --> 00:10:46.155]  spanking a child, yelling at a dad, things like that, those people got stuck in 1996.
[00:10:46.155 --> 00:10:53.155]  It was a measure that he inserted in a conference committee in the Senate behind closed doors.
[00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:57.155]  Yeah, they can load it in this pork barrel at any time and Bush says he'll sign it.
[00:10:57.155 --> 00:10:59.155]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:10:59.235 --> 00:11:03.235]  It comes out of a conference committee, it's already been voted on in some fashion,
[00:11:03.235 --> 00:11:08.235]  the underlying bill has anyway, in both houses.
[00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:11.235]  Now they can no longer make amendments from the floor.
[00:11:11.235 --> 00:11:12.235]  This is the final vote.
[00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:14.235]  It's up or down.
[00:11:14.235 --> 00:11:19.235]  And here's how it is likely to happen and here's how it would have happened had Lautenberg
[00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:22.235]  been confronted in the Senate.
[00:11:22.235 --> 00:11:27.235]  Look, buddy, until your measure comes out of that appropriation bill, I'm going to filibuster your bill.
[00:11:27.315 --> 00:11:33.315]  Well, that's all well and good, perhaps on most legislation, but inside the beltway,
[00:11:33.315 --> 00:11:37.315]  it's just unimaginable to think that you might shut down part of the government.
[00:11:37.315 --> 00:11:41.315]  And that's what the filibuster of an appropriations bill would do.
[00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:46.315]  So, which do you think is more important, operating the government or keeping the people free to own firearms?
[00:11:46.315 --> 00:11:48.315]  Well, take S-22.
[00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:52.315]  It's a law enforcement anti-terror, law enforcement funding package.
[00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:56.395]  It's a giant spending bill and they've got all this stuff in there.
[00:11:56.395 --> 00:11:58.395]  I mean, this is what they're doing.
[00:11:58.395 --> 00:11:59.395]  Exactly.
[00:11:59.395 --> 00:12:03.395]  And now Bush wouldn't sign that, at least we don't think he would.
[00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:07.395]  So that probably keeps my scenario from occurring.
[00:12:07.395 --> 00:12:10.395]  But with the semi-auto ban, he said he would sign it.
[00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:12.395]  So, hey, we don't have to shut down the government.
[00:12:12.395 --> 00:12:14.395]  We'll just give it to him and he'll sign it.
[00:12:14.395 --> 00:12:21.395]  Well, he's supposed to be a conservative and we're seeing the opposite from Bush.
[00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:24.475]  And I just think it's a big wake-up call for people.
[00:12:24.475 --> 00:12:29.475]  And there could be a mass shooting the week of the vote, which even Limbaugh has pointed out,
[00:12:29.475 --> 00:12:32.475]  just keeps happening right on time for them.
[00:12:32.475 --> 00:12:34.475]  And that could easily get it through.
[00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:36.475]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:12:36.475 --> 00:12:42.475]  I think reality has begun to impinge on the principal culprit, in my opinion.
[00:12:42.475 --> 00:12:45.475]  Well, of course, it's the president for allowing the statements to be made.
[00:12:45.475 --> 00:12:48.475]  But Karl Rove is his principal political advisor.
[00:12:48.555 --> 00:12:51.555]  And I don't see him as a principled man at all.
[00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:56.555]  And I see him figuring that, hey, we're going to get some easy votes from the soccer moms
[00:12:56.555 --> 00:12:59.555]  and the gunnies don't have any other place to go.
[00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:01.555]  Well, first of all, that's a flawed analysis.
[00:13:01.555 --> 00:13:07.555]  Because the people that voted for George Bush in West Virginia are not quote-unquote gunnies.
[00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:11.555]  They're Democrats who normally vote Democratic no matter what.
[00:13:11.555 --> 00:13:17.555]  Yeah, Bush would have totally lost the election worse than he did in the general vote
[00:13:17.635 --> 00:13:19.635]  if it wasn't for the gunners.
[00:13:19.635 --> 00:13:20.635]  Absolutely.
[00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:24.635]  And so these people have no fear whatsoever of voting for Democrats.
[00:13:24.635 --> 00:13:26.635]  And it could happen all over again.
[00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:28.635]  But maybe we'll have a chance to continue.
[00:13:28.635 --> 00:13:29.635]  Yeah, we'll talk about that.
[00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:33.635]  Great analysis from Larry Pratt, founder and president of Gunners of America.
[00:13:33.635 --> 00:13:37.635]  Gunners.org, great analysis, great information, great organization.
[00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:39.635]  And we'll come back and talk about Iraq.
[00:13:39.635 --> 00:13:42.635]  They have more rights there than we do here for guns.
[00:13:42.635 --> 00:13:44.635]  Then we'll talk about Canada.
[00:13:44.715 --> 00:13:46.715]  Most of their big prophets are saying,
[00:13:46.715 --> 00:13:48.715]  we're not going to register and take the guns.
[00:13:48.715 --> 00:13:50.715]  No feds.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:14:22.060]  We're talking to Larry Pratt, gun owners of America.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:29.819]  It's not just the gun issues that the neocons are on the big government tyranny side of the fence.
[00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:37.500]  It's across the board and it is important for gun owners to be involved and conservatives to be
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:43.180]  involved by pointing this out. We are now seeing a shift at least in rhetoric back to a more
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:48.620]  conservative viewpoint because of pressure. I talked about how the NRA wouldn't talk about
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.459]  the assault weapons ban, how Bush is going to reauthorize it. They finally did in their
[00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:57.020]  legislative alert. They really won't do it in their magazine. How important was it that the
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:04.699]  real gun owners, real conservatives are forcing the NRA to not be as anti-gun as they are?
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:11.180]  We hear from our members all the time, those that get emailed particularly because that's how word
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:17.180]  spreads so quickly and effectively now, that they've also contacted the NRA. They belong to
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:24.060]  both and they see us doing something and they want the NRA to do the same thing. I can tell
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.380]  you that they can express themselves in very forceful ways. I wanted to share with you an
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:35.819]  anecdote of just days after the first announcement was made by a spokesman for Bush that he was going
[00:15:35.819 --> 00:15:43.980]  to ban guns again if he had a chance. Carl Rove, his principal advisor, went up to New Hampshire,
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.980]  gave a talk at a university and afterwards entertained questions from the audience,
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:55.740]  one of whom was our member. I'll just refer to him as Sam. Sam asked a question something like,
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:01.020]  what in the world do you think you guys are doing with this? He got back a very
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:09.020]  imperious answer that this is the way it is. Sam didn't really like that so he went with a group of
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:14.060]  other people that wanted to shake Rove's hand and whatnot as he was on his way to the limo.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:20.300]  Just before he popped in the back door, Sam was able to repeat the question. Rove was visibly
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:26.060]  angry and started repeating how he didn't understand politics and grabbed Sam on the arm
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:32.859]  and said, I'm older than he is and I'm bigger than he is. I grabbed him on his arm and I said,
[00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:43.339]  look, you tell your boss if he signs that bill, he's crossed the line. And Rove was beside
[00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:48.300]  himself, didn't know what to say, just let him drive him away at that point. They're finally
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:56.060]  beginning to see that this is not something like whether the sugar beet industry gets more
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.500]  protection or not. Then people do have strong feelings but hey, those sorts of things. That's
[00:17:01.579 --> 00:17:05.659]  just the way it is. Now they're understanding this is about the Bill of Rights and what America is
[00:17:05.659 --> 00:17:10.940]  and if they're going to wrap themselves in that flag, they're going to have to uphold the values
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.500]  of that constitution and that Bill of Rights. But Larry Pratt, I want to shift gears for a second.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:21.820]  Canada, many of their big provinces are saying we are not going to enforce your gun ban.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:27.179]  You register them, you confiscate them. They're actually saying, one of the heads of the provinces
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:33.179]  says, their law enforcement arm says, this only hurts law abiding citizens, this is wrong.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.700]  And now police, the federal police are warning the provinces and more provinces are defecting,
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:44.139]  now the majority of them. Is this good news? I think it's extremely good news,
[00:17:44.139 --> 00:17:48.460]  particularly when you consider that it's Canada where they have more of a British mindset that
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.260]  whatever the government says is legitimate because there's no legitimate constitution in writing.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.820]  They've heard about the crime rate exploding in England and Australia after the gun bans,
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:05.740]  they know the truth. They do and I think the driver for this resistance to this tyranny
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:10.860]  has been the province of Alberta. Those folks really think like people in the western United
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:16.220]  States. They've taken the lead on this and frankly at the province of Alberta, I've talked to people
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.659]  from there. In fact, I interviewed one on my little talk show that's a weekly hour thing,
[00:18:21.659 --> 00:18:28.540]  Live Fire, an editor of a conservative publication up there who printed the results of a public
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:34.060]  opinion survey that found that a bare majority of the people of Alberta, if you had it on the
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:40.379]  ballot right now, do we want out of here? They'd say yes in a heartbeat and then make themselves
[00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:44.460]  an independent country with lots of oil. But I mean that's exciting that you have
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:49.500]  whole states refusing and then their citizens are on TV saying, I'm not turning my gun and
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.300]  you can come get it. We need more of that attitude here and we need to have those revolutions of
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:59.420]  information and standing up in these states like Massachusetts, California. I know we've got the
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.580]  people, we just don't have the media power. We've got to promote the alternative media in those
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:10.780]  states. What about Iraq not disarming the American people but having to back off and not disarm the
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:17.500]  Iraqi people? I think that's going to be a very effective tool in trying to keep the lid on the
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.659]  semi-auto ban and keep it from being renewed. Because they're going to be allowed to own
[00:19:21.659 --> 00:19:26.860]  semi-autos, fully autos there, but we can't here. Oh, I think that really sticks in the throat.
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.580]  All right, Larry Pratt, gunowners.org, thank you so much for coming on the show. Alex, thank you.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.500]  Your site's got incredible legislative analysis and information. I visit it daily.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.860]  God bless you. We look forward to having you back up in the future. Same here. Thank you.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.980]  Take care, my friend. I'll be right back. I'll get into Walmart pushing the RFID.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.420]  New information on that, retina scanners to drive your car. It's all coming up.
