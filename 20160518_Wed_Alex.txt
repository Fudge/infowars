[00:00.000 --> 00:07.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday edition.
[00:07.960 --> 00:14.600]  Here's a report from John Bound coming up in just a mere seconds.
[00:14.600 --> 00:20.000]  The economic impact of the refugee crisis across the world is staggering and completely
[00:20.000 --> 00:21.000]  overlooked.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.720]  As all signs point towards a global economic collapse, in Germany, RT reports the German
[00:26.720 --> 00:31.800]  government will allocate nearly 94 billion euros for incoming refugees over the next
[00:31.800 --> 00:33.000]  five years.
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.860]  This includes housing integration, German language courses and social welfare benefits
[00:37.860 --> 00:41.760]  and dealing with the underlying causes of the refugee influx.
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.520]  In February, Derspiegel reported the German government expects 3.6 million refugees to
[00:47.520 --> 00:53.520]  enter the country by 2020, including the 1.1 million that have arrived in 2015.
[00:53.520 --> 00:55.920]  And what does Germany get in return?
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.320]  100,000 plus crimes by refugees were reported in 2015.
[01:00.320 --> 01:05.000]  The Gate Stone Institute reports the actual number of crimes in Germany committed by migrants
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.240]  in 2015 may exceed 400,000.
[01:08.240 --> 01:12.840]  The report doesn't include crime from data from North Rhine Westphalia, the most populous
[01:12.840 --> 01:17.080]  state in Germany, and also the state with the largest number of migrants.
[01:17.080 --> 01:21.520]  North Rhine Westphalia's biggest city is Cologne, where on New Year's Eve hundreds of German
[01:21.520 --> 01:24.080]  women were sexually assaulted by migrants.
[01:24.080 --> 01:29.240]  Andres Schultz, director of the Association of Criminal Police in Germany, says, for years
[01:29.240 --> 01:34.560]  the policy has been to leave the German population in the dark about the actual crime situation.
[01:34.560 --> 01:38.000]  The citizens are being played for fools, rather than tell the truth.
[01:38.000 --> 01:43.280]  The government officials are evading responsibility and passing the blame onto the citizens and
[01:43.280 --> 01:44.280]  the police.
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.760]  Ten percent of the migrants from the chaos in Iraq and Syria have reached Europe so far.
[01:48.760 --> 01:53.400]  Eight to ten million migrants are still on the way, according to Gerd Mohler.
[01:53.400 --> 01:59.880]  The jobless, non-assimilating refugees are doing the exact opposite of what was lauded
[01:59.880 --> 02:03.040]  as a positive economic boon.
[02:03.040 --> 02:07.160]  Jobless rates among refugees are weighing down on the welfare systems, where for example
[02:07.160 --> 02:11.960]  in Greece where they are heading for yet another bailout, refugees far outweigh the unemployed
[02:11.960 --> 02:17.360]  Greek citizens that were already under pressure with the fight to stabilize their own economy.
[02:17.360 --> 02:22.220]  As the Business Insider reports, on the one hand you have countries like the UK, Estonia
[02:22.220 --> 02:27.120]  and Ireland where the jobless rate of migrants is pretty similar to that of its domestic
[02:27.120 --> 02:28.120]  citizens.
[02:28.120 --> 02:32.640]  Moreover, in the Czech Republic, Cyprus and Latvia, the jobless rates among migrants
[02:32.640 --> 02:36.360]  are even below those of domestic citizens.
[02:36.360 --> 02:40.120]  Migrants from outside of the EU see much higher jobless rates.
[02:40.120 --> 02:45.040]  On the other hand, however in places like Slovenia, Spain, France and Sweden, the jobless
[02:45.040 --> 02:49.840]  rates among the migrants are over ten percent above that of the domestic citizens.
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.040]  Regardless, the handouts just keep coming out of the taxpayer's pocket.
[02:54.040 --> 02:59.640]  The Belgian government awarded a convicted al-Qaeda terrorist roughly $88,000 after
[02:59.640 --> 03:04.680]  the jihadists claimed his extradition to the United States violated his human rights.
[03:04.680 --> 03:11.040]  The ECHR ordered to pay the jihadists no less than about $100,000, according to RT.
[03:11.040 --> 03:15.280]  His family, which lives in Belgium, had already received 11,000 euros.
[03:15.280 --> 03:20.880]  The United Kingdom has given as of today over $1 billion in aid to the refugees.
[03:20.880 --> 03:26.280]  The United States has dropped nearly $3 billion on the clowered and piven style crisis.
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.480]  The criminals are clearly running the global economy off a cliff.
[03:30.480 --> 03:34.840]  All in the name of an emerging New World Order rolled out in the secretive trade treaties
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.000]  that are on the verge of enforcement and an engineered refugee crisis.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.720]  Meanwhile, the citizens of the world are unwittingly financing their own enslavement.
[03:44.720 --> 03:53.840]  The time for half measures is over, John Bowne for Enforce.com.
[03:53.840 --> 03:54.840]  Very important report.
[03:54.840 --> 03:59.080]  I'd love to kick the broadcast off several days a week with a John Bowne report.
[03:59.080 --> 04:04.200]  When we come back, there are a bunch of news articles about Facebook and they're asking,
[04:04.200 --> 04:10.680]  is Facebook censoring individuals' pages, not just conservative and libertarian groups?
[04:10.680 --> 04:17.000]  And the answer is absolutely, we've seen countless examples of our listeners over the years not
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.160]  able to share our memes, our videos, our articles.
[04:22.160 --> 04:30.880]  So by extension, when they censor, say, a pro-national sovereignty, anti-open borders group, which
[04:30.880 --> 04:34.040]  they admit they've done, they're then censoring you being able to share it.
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.920]  So it's good to see that blowing up, boy, there is so much to cover.
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.600]  Big quakes rumble in the Northwest, volcanoes, a bunch of second amendment news, the Good,
[04:43.600 --> 04:47.160]  the Bad, and the tyrannical.
[04:47.160 --> 04:50.560]  We've also got the latest on Clinton declares victory in Kentucky primary, Sanders wins
[04:50.560 --> 04:53.840]  Oregon, and Sanders is refusing to step down.
[04:53.840 --> 04:56.480]  He's really in the lead, but they're still in the election from him.
[04:56.480 --> 04:57.720]  This is very explosive.
[04:57.720 --> 04:58.720]  Stay with us.
[04:58.720 --> 05:02.440]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com, and I want to talk about something that really pisses
[05:02.440 --> 05:03.440]  me off.
[05:03.440 --> 05:07.480]  The fact that we can live in a culture where people can identify as things other than what
[05:07.480 --> 05:08.680]  they actually are.
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.640]  The fact that a man can identify as a woman and then go use that restroom, or the fact
[05:13.640 --> 05:19.400]  that a white woman can identify as an African-American woman, what's called Rachel Dolezoff, I think
[05:19.400 --> 05:25.640]  at this point, then she should be able to get reparations for slavery, or maybe a 18-year-old
[05:25.640 --> 05:30.800]  kid who plays Call of Duty all day and wants to identify as an elite special ops soldier.
[05:30.800 --> 05:34.960]  I think if he carries out a really bad ass mission on Call of Duty, Obama should have
[05:34.960 --> 05:37.680]  a ceremony and give that man the Medal of Honor.
[05:37.680 --> 05:41.240]  Or perhaps you're lazy and you want to be trans handicapped, that way you can park in
[05:41.240 --> 05:44.440]  all the good spots at the mall in a golden-crow buffet.
[05:44.440 --> 05:50.440]  This is the Matrix that we live in now in 2016, a world full of fairies, fake Asian
[05:50.440 --> 05:53.760]  tall people, men who are women, white women who are black.
[05:53.760 --> 05:56.320]  This is the fall of the human species.
[05:56.320 --> 05:58.320]  I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[05:58.320 --> 06:02.880]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and

[08:01.560 --> 08:18.560]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[08:18.560 --> 08:27.440]  I know we got a lot of emails, a lot of comments, even the folks here in the office that they
[08:27.440 --> 08:32.760]  like the fact that I spent the first 45 minutes of the news yesterday pretty much just reading
[08:32.760 --> 08:37.080]  headlines and then giving a very short comment to it.
[08:37.080 --> 08:40.240]  And I'm going to attempt to do that again today, but boy, I tell you, the theme that
[08:40.240 --> 08:46.960]  emerges from the news and also what I experience every day is massive weaponized fifth generation
[08:46.960 --> 08:54.800]  warfare by the social engineers to create absolute divide and conquer, a total tower
[08:54.800 --> 08:59.400]  of Babel, a tower of Babel.
[08:59.400 --> 09:07.120]  So the technotronic computer grid algorithm-controlled AI computer system can just take over.
[09:07.120 --> 09:12.240]  While we're all busy running around fighting with each other over the most mindless idiocy,
[09:12.240 --> 09:16.640]  all over the country break down as men are going into bathrooms and people are freaking
[09:16.640 --> 09:21.280]  out giant boycotts and billions lost in target.
[09:21.280 --> 09:26.840]  Colleges in high schools announce all over the country looking at a black person in the
[09:26.840 --> 09:35.160]  eyes is racist, smiling at a black person is racist, frowning is racist, and this is the
[09:35.160 --> 09:42.040]  government and the media doing this, not black people or anybody else in this country.
[09:42.040 --> 09:47.880]  It's meant to totally make everyone uncomfortable and cause the disintegration in society and
[09:47.880 --> 09:59.040]  make everyone absolutely mentally ill, chip on the shoulder, uptight losers.
[09:59.040 --> 10:03.620]  But imagine if the people completely woke up to this and saw through it and rejected
[10:03.620 --> 10:07.560]  it and said no to it and refused to submit to it.
[10:07.560 --> 10:15.320]  That would be a beautiful thing.
[10:15.320 --> 10:24.840]  It's gotten so extreme that I personally, recently have heard people twice say don't
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.160]  use the word Mexican.
[10:29.160 --> 10:38.400]  When you describe something as Mexican, like Mexican food, it'd be like if some lady was
[10:38.400 --> 10:42.440]  dating a German immigrant, you'd say yeah, she's got a new German boyfriend.
[10:42.440 --> 10:46.800]  I actually heard someone say, yeah, we're going out to dinner to meet her new Mexican
[10:46.800 --> 10:50.760]  boyfriend and somebody went, you don't say Mexican.
[10:50.760 --> 10:55.240]  And then I heard someone else a week ago say, don't say let's go eat Mexican food.
[10:55.240 --> 10:56.240]  That's offensive.
[10:56.240 --> 11:00.800]  They're like mother or father or he or she, they're making the whole language where you
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.240]  just freak out and don't even use language because it's threatening to you and you get
[11:05.240 --> 11:11.760]  in trouble if you do, that is directly out of Insoc and the Fabian Socialists and their
[11:11.760 --> 11:18.160]  admitted plan that is in mainline textbooks in the UK and was actually put into fiction
[11:18.160 --> 11:27.320]  via 1984 where they're reducing the language, I mean this is so hardcore and you see the
[11:27.320 --> 11:35.040]  small guild of weirdos, mainly a bizarre chicken necked weird white people that actually follow
[11:35.040 --> 11:36.400]  all of this.
[11:36.400 --> 11:43.160]  They are basket cases, but they're really proud of the fact that they're using the latest
[11:43.160 --> 11:48.520]  language up to date and do what they're told, it's like that Portlandia episode from five,
[11:48.520 --> 11:51.960]  six years ago where they come in and ask, what was the chicken's name?
[11:51.960 --> 11:52.960]  Where was he born?
[11:52.960 --> 11:53.960]  Where did he go to school?
[11:53.960 --> 11:54.960]  Was he treated well?
[11:54.960 --> 11:58.720]  They spend like an hour talking about it, finally say, I don't want the chicken, I want
[11:58.720 --> 12:04.080]  the fish.
[12:04.080 --> 12:09.920]  Moral signaling, it's a cult.
[12:09.920 --> 12:14.920]  And these people in every statistic are many times less likely to give a charity, they're
[12:14.920 --> 12:20.760]  many more times likely to rob you, they're many times more likely to run scams and do
[12:20.760 --> 12:29.520]  not work hard because they are mental patients who operate in a world of knitting and backstabbing
[12:29.520 --> 12:34.720]  and tattling and freaking out and false flagging.
[12:34.720 --> 12:41.120]  Every day I run into so many examples of false flag, self-inflicted wound, staged events
[12:41.120 --> 12:46.520]  that I don't even cover them by the social justice warriors most of the time.
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.200]  Muslims are doing it at massive levels and getting caught, homosexuals are doing it at
[12:51.200 --> 12:55.920]  massive levels and again I'm going to say it, I don't dislike anybody but I'm not going
[12:55.920 --> 12:59.760]  to use the words you tell me to use anymore when you say use gay because then it's don't
[12:59.760 --> 13:00.960]  use mother and father.
[13:00.960 --> 13:09.160]  It's heterosexual, homosexual, it's again, sounds reasonable but it turns into control
[13:09.160 --> 13:16.080]  of language and people saying what language to use but it's like the homosexual preacher
[13:16.080 --> 13:19.680]  that goes and hold foods and makes up the fact that they put fag on the cake.
[13:19.680 --> 13:25.960]  I told you day one that was fake and of course it was fake and we've got a black student
[13:25.960 --> 13:31.920]  running around in a college beating up three people on surveillance cameras in his racial
[13:31.920 --> 13:37.600]  jihad attack and he just went to the police and said I have been racially attacked, it
[13:37.600 --> 13:43.400]  was a big national story and of course they went to surveillance camera and it wasn't
[13:43.400 --> 13:48.440]  happening but it's a climate where they teach everybody this is how you get ahead.
[13:48.440 --> 13:53.600]  There's an actual mainstream news article today about Bill Clinton's man spreading,
[13:53.600 --> 13:58.040]  they're going to show photos of your TV viewer and it's got a whole bunch of photos of him
[13:58.040 --> 14:04.160]  at the White House kicking back with his leg on a stool, just the confident relaxed pose
[14:04.160 --> 14:08.880]  like the famous Greek statue where the legs are a little bit spread open and the man sitting
[14:08.880 --> 14:15.000]  there relaxed with his fist to his chin.
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.600]  I mean that's how men sit but see they make that something aggressive so people tell
[14:21.600 --> 14:28.640]  you don't do it because they got to find things that aren't racist, they got to find things
[14:28.640 --> 14:32.960]  that aren't aggressive to women to make everyone guilty, they have to find things that everybody
[14:32.960 --> 14:39.360]  does so they can attack you like Bill Clinton serving fried chicken in Kentucky, I mean that's
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.280]  what people basically eat fried chicken, I don't care if they're white or black or who
[14:43.280 --> 14:48.880]  they are, that's where fried chicken comes from basically that area of the quote south
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.120]  right on the Mason-Dixon line.
[14:53.120 --> 14:58.000]  I mean back then folks people fried meat, they fried chicken, most people fried meat because
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.800]  it tastes better but the point is is that when a basketball coach sits with his knees
[15:04.800 --> 15:09.600]  open or Bill Clinton does that's how you sit comfortably, has nothing to do with attacking
[15:09.600 --> 15:10.600]  women.
[15:10.600 --> 15:15.440]  I'm sure he'll come out and apologize for having his knees apart when he sits down but
[15:15.440 --> 15:19.960]  raping women's okay, that's the same thing, Donald Trump's back as he asked women out
[15:19.960 --> 15:23.880]  on dates when he was in between marriages but it's okay that Clinton's flying around
[15:23.880 --> 15:29.560]  with Mr. Epstein, Epstein you know on the Lolita Express pedophile plane to Pedophile
[15:29.560 --> 15:36.760]  Island because they want to target Trump and say something that every man does or most
[15:36.760 --> 15:44.760]  men do certainly that alpha males do, I mean if you don't go up and charm women and start
[15:44.760 --> 15:49.440]  talking to them you're not ever going to get a date with them, I mean they're making normal
[15:49.440 --> 15:55.000]  mammal activity basically illegal.
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.360]  You can watch male birds hop around your yard up to females, are they being aggressive, are
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.360]  they being evil, no that's what creatures do to mate.
[16:03.360 --> 16:09.040]  You can watch a male whale swim up to a male female, is he trying to rape her, no if she's
[16:09.040 --> 16:16.120]  an estrus and is into it and likes him she's going to mate with him but again they're attacking
[16:16.120 --> 16:24.120]  the basic species where Donald Trump's bad because he asked women out on dates and treats
[16:24.120 --> 16:29.480]  them very well and then Bill Clinton's bad because he has his legs open when he sits
[16:29.480 --> 16:33.400]  down a little bit but it's okay that he's settled a bunch of rape cases, this is again
[16:33.400 --> 16:37.040]  about making everybody guilty, everybody bad and then having the state and the system nitty
[16:37.040 --> 16:42.080]  and tells them to do, oh and CBS News is apologizing but they're saying they'll do better, they've
[16:42.080 --> 16:49.120]  got a couple hit shows that have mainly male lineups, there's hit shows of female lineups
[16:49.120 --> 16:54.080]  but it's known in Hollywood it's known everywhere in the world it's known back in Thespian days
[16:54.080 --> 17:00.160]  that women like to watch men more and men like to watch men more as well, movies with
[17:00.160 --> 17:08.960]  main stars being men with some female actresses so stars as well are the top grossing movies,
[17:08.960 --> 17:14.400]  are the top grossing books, are the top grossing plays so they want to basically ban it everywhere
[17:14.400 --> 17:19.320]  and say what ratio has to be there so there's not competition but it's really about the
[17:19.320 --> 17:23.680]  state saying what you can have in a movie what you can do, see they don't want to just
[17:23.680 --> 17:30.560]  shut down infowars.com or drudgereport.com with the federal elections commission, FEC
[17:30.560 --> 17:37.040]  openly saying they want to regulate him, they want to regulate everything, regulate speech,
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.200]  this is so totalitarian and it's out in the open so I'm done ranting about that, we'll
[17:42.200 --> 17:46.520]  actually get into these articles but there it is, Entertainment Weekly, CBS says shows
[17:46.520 --> 17:52.400]  are more diverse despite criticism and they're just complaining that there are leading men
[17:52.400 --> 17:57.720]  in the movies period, see there's a directive for video games and movies and TV shows that's
[17:57.720 --> 18:03.560]  admitted where if you want an Oscar have all the main tough guys be women, if you want
[18:03.560 --> 18:12.880]  an Oscar have it all be centralized on women and that's not to help women, it is simply
[18:12.880 --> 18:17.080]  to set up bizarre cultural wars.
[18:17.080 --> 18:25.000]  I saw a story I'm seeing in this morning that we'll cover in Cleveland of the predominantly
[18:25.000 --> 18:33.320]  black neighborhood that has the highest test scores in Cleveland but they're going to
[18:33.320 --> 18:39.520]  bust people upwards of 10 miles across town to this other school that's predominantly
[18:39.520 --> 18:44.400]  white and I'll tell you why they're doing that, it's because that black school's got
[18:44.400 --> 18:48.240]  high test scores and I'm not for quote segregation but if you looked at the black communities
[18:48.240 --> 18:54.960]  before the new evil of quote force integration that took one evil and created another, all
[18:54.960 --> 18:58.760]  the black home businesses, the black home hotels, the black doctors all of it, even the black
[18:58.760 --> 19:02.720]  universities got hit, everything got hit because that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger
[19:02.720 --> 19:08.600]  if you know you're under attack, lower level of kids out of wedlock you name it than the
[19:08.600 --> 19:13.040]  white community, you watch what happens to those black students when they force them
[19:13.040 --> 19:19.200]  into some yuppie spoiled rotten school, you watch their test scores will plummet and that's
[19:19.200 --> 19:22.720]  exactly why they're doing this all over the country, they're finding communities that
[19:22.720 --> 19:26.480]  are doing well and by the way they've done a poll, seen and admitted almost every one
[19:26.480 --> 19:29.880]  of the school, the academics, everybody says we don't want this to happen and they're
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.600]  telling them we're going to close your nice schools and we're going to make you go across
[19:34.600 --> 19:40.400]  town and that will create a big fight, I mean if you bust in kids from other town period
[19:40.400 --> 19:45.240]  that were all white it'd cause a big weird thing, but I mean this is just, this is social
[19:45.240 --> 19:50.940]  engineering folks what they do, how they do it, how they operate, they are just totally
[19:50.940 --> 19:55.440]  destroying our culture and our civilization, it's shutting off our power plants and raising
[19:55.440 --> 20:00.000]  taxes so we can't compete and an Obamacare to wreck us, it's all by design.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.400]  A good stove is at the top of the list for any serious survivalist, that's why you have

[22:29.360 --> 22:32.520]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[22:32.520 --> 22:35.680]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[22:35.680 --> 22:38.000]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  His excuse?
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.160]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[22:43.160 --> 22:44.760]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[22:44.760 --> 22:49.600]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative
[22:49.600 --> 22:50.600]  for my father.
[22:50.600 --> 22:51.600]  Don't wait.
[22:51.600 --> 22:56.360]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org right now for not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved
[22:56.360 --> 22:57.360]  ones.
[22:57.360 --> 22:58.360]  Again, that's LibertyOnCall.org.
[22:58.360 --> 23:00.640]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[23:00.640 --> 23:04.800]  I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[23:04.800 --> 23:08.640]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[23:08.640 --> 23:12.640]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse or a serious
[23:12.640 --> 23:13.640]  drought.
[23:13.640 --> 23:17.040]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[23:17.040 --> 23:19.840]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[23:19.840 --> 23:25.360]  A U.S. company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[23:25.360 --> 23:27.020]  It's a home freeze dryer.
[23:27.020 --> 23:30.320]  With the product, you can preserve the food your family loves.
[23:30.320 --> 23:35.200]  And the best part is, the food will last 25 years and still taste great.
[23:35.200 --> 23:37.120]  I've tried it and it's amazing.
[23:37.120 --> 23:41.360]  With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right, you can literally freeze dry anything you
[23:41.360 --> 23:44.120]  eat, even things like ice cream.
[23:44.120 --> 23:53.000]  To learn more, call Harvest Right today at 800-594-4635 or go to harvestright.com.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.640]  That's 800-594-4635.
[23:56.640 --> 23:58.640]  For Harvest Right, go to harvestright.com.
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.800]  It is 1124 Central Standard Time on your host, Alex Jones, and the second hour Dr. Edward
[24:32.800 --> 24:36.640]  Gribbs is going to be joining us to talk about Tritium.
[24:36.640 --> 24:42.960]  It isn't picked up by regular Geiger counters or field meters, but almost all nuclear reactors
[24:42.960 --> 24:46.400]  in the United States and the world are leaking it.
[24:46.400 --> 24:47.400]  And a bunch of other isotopes.
[24:47.400 --> 24:52.040]  And this is actually in the scientific papers, but it's not really known by the public.
[24:52.040 --> 24:54.640]  And it's one reason cancer is exploding.
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.700]  We have Joe Jennings, his dad died just about a year ago from a giant brain tumor.
[24:58.700 --> 25:01.720]  He grew up next to one of these big nuclear power plants.
[25:01.720 --> 25:06.400]  And they even admitted that that was one of the main causes of the cancers increasing.
[25:06.400 --> 25:09.040]  And now they don't even care about the reactors.
[25:09.040 --> 25:13.960]  It's reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency that 93% of nuclear reactors,
[25:13.960 --> 25:19.320]  and there's more than 600 of them, 400 plus for power, are leaking.
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.160]  And now they're 30, 40 years old, most of them, they just don't care.
[25:23.160 --> 25:24.560]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[25:24.560 --> 25:27.000]  And I was never an anti-nuclear power guy.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.920]  It was done properly in things that wouldn't be as big an issue, but these companies just
[25:30.920 --> 25:32.920]  don't care.
[25:32.920 --> 25:34.520]  Just like with genetic engineering and everything else.
[25:34.520 --> 25:38.960]  So that's coming up with Dr. Group and others here in studio, including one of the victims
[25:38.960 --> 25:42.040]  of this with us in the second hour.
[25:42.040 --> 25:44.680]  This hits pretty close to home with Joe Jennings.
[25:44.680 --> 25:51.200]  And of course, Joe's concerned about his health in the future as well, dealing with this.
[25:51.200 --> 25:53.800]  I had family in Vietnam hit by Agent Orange.
[25:53.800 --> 25:55.320]  No history of deformed children came back.
[25:55.320 --> 26:01.440]  Their first kids were deformed, but at least older brother died when he was about two.
[26:01.440 --> 26:03.040]  This is the type of stuff we deal with here.
[26:03.040 --> 26:07.320]  So it's a very, very serious situation, just like glyphosates in the water, and we're going
[26:07.320 --> 26:12.600]  to be exposing it and talking about ways to try to block it or not have the effects be
[26:12.600 --> 26:13.600]  as bad.
[26:13.600 --> 26:16.920]  But you do not want to live near a nuclear power plant, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:16.920 --> 26:20.680]  Or you definitely want to be on top of them and make sure that they're not leaking tritium,
[26:20.680 --> 26:25.760]  which will break down the details coming up today.
[26:25.760 --> 26:29.120]  And of course, a few years ago, we said Jakari Jackson and others out to California.
[26:29.120 --> 26:33.920]  They found upwards of 25 times the safe levels on the Geiger counters and field meters and
[26:33.920 --> 26:35.760]  ours have been tested and certified.
[26:35.760 --> 26:37.400]  People said, oh, you're not radiologists.
[26:37.400 --> 26:38.400]  You can't speak.
[26:38.400 --> 26:42.120]  The army responded to us and the Navy went to the exact same spots.
[26:42.120 --> 26:46.360]  It was in the San Francisco Chronicle and said, yes, their findings were accurate upwards
[26:46.360 --> 26:50.720]  of 25 times the normal safe level, but we say it's okay.
[26:50.720 --> 26:53.720]  And they'd pull fish out of the ocean.
[26:53.720 --> 26:57.760]  People catching fish, we'd put a Geiger counter to them even higher because it bio accumulates
[26:57.760 --> 27:03.240]  in the fish, just like other toxins do, like lead, mercury and arsenic.
[27:03.240 --> 27:08.240]  So that's coming up today in the second hour.
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.320]  By the way, I don't normally think to do plugs like this, but I'll do one because it segues
[27:11.320 --> 27:12.320]  to it.
[27:12.320 --> 27:16.240]  And that's why you need gravity-fed water filtration systems like the Alexa Pure and
[27:16.240 --> 27:17.240]  the Pro Pure.
[27:17.240 --> 27:22.200]  You also need it on your shower heads because you absorb through your skin and breathe a
[27:22.200 --> 27:24.040]  lot of this stuff as well.
[27:24.040 --> 27:27.200]  And these systems, the four-stage filter we have is the very best out there, has a very
[27:27.200 --> 27:29.320]  low price as well.
[27:29.320 --> 27:36.040]  It's an amazing filter, the Pro Max filter by Pro Pure, 60-something bucks.
[27:36.040 --> 27:39.600]  Leading competitors are like 70 or 80 and are one-stage filters and don't even cut
[27:39.600 --> 27:40.880]  out what we cut out.
[27:40.880 --> 27:45.520]  This totally cuts out hundreds and hundreds of different toxins and other things.
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.240]  And then the others, it reduces down to like 99, 99.7, 99.9.
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.040]  We've got all the tests online there at m4store.com.
[27:54.040 --> 27:58.360]  You can go see each filtration system, see what the test showed.
[27:58.360 --> 28:00.160]  None of these cut everything out.
[28:00.160 --> 28:08.120]  Okay, not even reverse osmosis, not even distilled cuts out stuff down to the billions or whatever,
[28:08.120 --> 28:10.000]  but it basically removes it.
[28:10.000 --> 28:15.280]  Like an emergency system like the Livestraw or other systems, that just makes really bad
[28:15.280 --> 28:18.280]  water and a swamp okay to drink so you won't get sick.
[28:18.280 --> 28:23.400]  But it isn't like an Alexa Pure or a Pro Pure system that's gravity-fed that cuts out
[28:23.400 --> 28:24.400]  99.999999.
[28:24.400 --> 28:26.480]  And a lot of things completely cuts it out.
[28:26.480 --> 28:29.280]  We've got great reverse osmosis systems as well.
[28:29.280 --> 28:32.920]  You just don't want to drink reverse osmosis all the time because it also cuts out all
[28:32.920 --> 28:33.920]  the minerals.
[28:33.920 --> 28:40.600]  But if you do daily, drink a few glasses of the recommended dose of the Vitamin Mineral
[28:40.600 --> 28:47.280]  Fusion system that's great fruit punch flavored, totally natural, totally healthy from plant-derived
[28:47.280 --> 28:51.440]  sources, m4warslife.com.
[28:51.440 --> 28:56.640]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is amazing, it's awesome, it's fantastic.
[28:56.640 --> 29:00.840]  And it is really something that everybody regardless should be having every day, replacing
[29:00.840 --> 29:04.920]  the juices that are so fattening, the sodas that are so toxic and have so many admitted
[29:04.920 --> 29:08.960]  problems, the so-called diet drinks that they admit in major studies actually make you crave
[29:08.960 --> 29:10.360]  more food and get fatter.
[29:10.360 --> 29:14.160]  Remember Dr. Blalock told me that 20 years ago and then now in the last few years it's
[29:14.160 --> 29:15.160]  been mainstream news.
[29:15.160 --> 29:18.160]  I mean, this is something that everybody should replace all the garbage you're drinking with.
[29:18.160 --> 29:23.560]  Do yourself a favor, buy a canister of it, it's concentrated, it's a month's supply.
[29:23.560 --> 29:27.680]  And you support the broadcast regardless, but it's so good, it makes me feel so good.
[29:27.680 --> 29:31.960]  In fact, speak of the devil, because somebody make me an ice drink of that because I keep
[29:31.960 --> 29:32.960]  forgetting, thank you.
[29:32.960 --> 29:36.440]  I don't really have butlers around here and don't have them toady ask me, but I'm kind
[29:36.440 --> 29:40.120]  of stuck here at the chair and I meant to go get one earlier and got busy working.
[29:40.120 --> 29:44.160]  But we're going to come right back, ladies and gentlemen, with a ton of news on the
[29:44.160 --> 29:49.320]  economy, on the race, on these earthquakes and so much more, stay with us.
[29:49.320 --> 29:53.040]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[29:53.040 --> 29:59.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.200 --> 30:02.640]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com, now I want to talk about something that really pisses
[30:02.640 --> 30:03.640]  me off.
[30:03.640 --> 30:07.640]  The fact that we can live in a culture where people can identify as things other than what
[30:07.640 --> 30:08.840]  they actually are.
[30:08.840 --> 30:13.280]  The fact that a man can identify as a woman and then go use that restroom.
[30:13.280 --> 30:18.120]  Or the fact that a white woman can identify as an African-American woman, what's called
[30:18.120 --> 30:23.520]  Rachel Dolezal, I think at this point, then she should be able to get reparations for
[30:23.520 --> 30:24.520]  slavery.
[30:24.520 --> 30:29.440]  Or maybe a 18-year-old kid who plays Call of Duty all day and wants to identify as an
[30:29.440 --> 30:30.960]  elite special ops soldier.
[30:30.960 --> 30:35.120]  I think if he carries out a really bad-ass mission on Call of Duty, Obama should have
[30:35.120 --> 30:37.680]  a ceremony and give that man the Medal of Honor.
[30:37.680 --> 30:41.400]  Or perhaps you're lazy and you want to be trans handicapped, that way you can park in
[30:41.400 --> 30:44.640]  all the good spots at the mall in a Golden Crab Buffet.
[30:44.640 --> 30:50.680]  This is the Matrix that we live in now in 2016, a world full of fairies, fake Asian
[30:50.680 --> 30:55.720]  tall people, men who are women, white women who are black, this is the fall of the human
[30:55.720 --> 30:56.720]  species.
[30:56.720 --> 30:57.720]  I'm Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[30:57.720 --> 31:02.520]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.

[33:20.880 --> 33:24.160]  I don't intend to make this another plug, but I am about to bring my vitamin mineral fusion
[33:24.160 --> 33:27.600]  from 4slife.com.
[33:27.600 --> 33:34.520]  The all-in-one amino acid, trace mineral, minerals, vitamins, all together, vitamin B12, you name
[33:34.520 --> 33:35.520]  it.
[33:35.520 --> 33:37.480]  Got a bunch of other fancy stuff in it.
[33:37.480 --> 33:44.320]  It really is set to be a leader in that area of nutraceuticals, some of the really cool
[33:44.320 --> 33:46.000]  stuff it's got in here.
[33:46.000 --> 33:53.680]  Yeah, vitamin B12, methylcobalamin-based, that's got so many other just amazing, amazing things
[33:53.680 --> 33:54.680]  in it.
[33:54.680 --> 34:02.440]  Coenzyme, Q10, L-glutamine, I mean I can't read the hundreds of things in here.
[34:02.440 --> 34:03.440]  It's amazing.
[34:03.440 --> 34:11.640]  Infowarslife.com and briefly finishing up on the water filtration, I start thinking about
[34:11.640 --> 34:17.000]  all the radiation, all the isotopes, all the tritium that is just permeating our society.
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.120]  Now the northern hemisphere is three times more radioactive than it was before the Manhattan
[34:22.120 --> 34:25.120]  Project.
[34:25.120 --> 34:30.160]  Not even before the A-bombs in 1945 at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, but radiation started
[34:30.160 --> 34:35.560]  going up and they started producing and mining that stuff and purifying it.
[34:35.560 --> 34:40.520]  And the main way you get it is the water table and you can filter your water and cut almost
[34:40.520 --> 34:44.720]  all that garbage out and the glyphosates, the roundup, runoff, all of it.
[34:44.720 --> 34:50.120]  You're still going to get it bio-accumulated in the food you eat, but man, it is so important
[34:50.120 --> 34:54.040]  that you put these filters on your showers and on your bathtubs and that you filter the
[34:54.040 --> 34:55.040]  water you drink, folks.
[34:55.040 --> 34:59.040]  It is so easy to protect your family to a great extent.
[34:59.040 --> 35:03.840]  Infowarsstore.com, 10% off promo code water on all water filtration systems.
[35:03.840 --> 35:09.040]  And finally, and I'm done plugging the shower, we have done a sale on Survival Shield X-Tube
[35:09.040 --> 35:12.000]  in a long time by itself at a level of 20%.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.080]  20% off, off on Survival Shield Nation Ion X-2 that protects the thyroid from so many
[35:17.080 --> 35:22.000]  of the bad halogens and radioactive isotopes, you name it, because your thyroid won't absorb
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.400]  them if it's already full of the good halogen iodine it needs to then basically produce
[35:27.400 --> 35:30.160]  hormones and a bunch of other things inside the body.
[35:30.160 --> 35:31.320]  You've got to have it.
[35:31.320 --> 35:36.080]  It will try to produce things with bad halogens if it doesn't have the good one.
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.440]  Survival Shield X-Tube, just game changing, pure iodine, true iodine, atomic iodine at
[35:41.440 --> 35:46.280]  Infowars and we say atomic, it isn't radioactive, folks, it is the element.
[35:46.280 --> 35:48.400]  It is iodine.
[35:48.400 --> 35:52.120]  There are many things saying there iodine that have iodine in it bound where you don't
[35:52.120 --> 35:53.120]  absorb it.
[35:53.120 --> 35:54.200]  This is iodine.
[35:54.200 --> 35:56.480]  This is pure iodine.
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.120]  Purple blue crystals.
[36:00.120 --> 36:01.120]  Not red.
[36:01.120 --> 36:05.560]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there.
[36:05.560 --> 36:06.560]  Let me do this.
[36:06.560 --> 36:07.560]  Let me do this.
[36:07.560 --> 36:09.040]  I've got to just read these headlines because I already got a political correctness the
[36:09.040 --> 36:12.680]  first 20 minutes or so and then I got off into what we're going to cover in the next
[36:12.680 --> 36:13.800]  hour and the last little second.
[36:13.800 --> 36:17.480]  Let me just do this and control myself.
[36:17.480 --> 36:18.480]  Let me just start.
[36:18.480 --> 36:21.560]  This doesn't mean it's our top story, but there's just so much in here that I'm going
[36:21.560 --> 36:23.760]  to start and just give you the headlines right now.
[36:23.760 --> 36:28.120]  Zika expected to spread to Europe this summer already spreading to the United States and
[36:28.120 --> 36:33.800]  is sexually transmitted.
[36:33.800 --> 36:38.560]  Companies of free speech want 60 million First Amendment Institute at Columbia University,
[36:38.560 --> 36:40.560]  but I looked up Columbia University.
[36:40.560 --> 36:45.600]  They've got all the social justice warrior free speech banning garbage there.
[36:45.600 --> 36:46.600]  Whatever.
[36:46.600 --> 36:49.920]  Maybe they'll rediscover it.
[36:49.920 --> 36:55.200]  Markets just reflect whatever central planners want them to is what a lot of the top banking
[36:55.200 --> 36:57.480]  experts are now admitting is going on.
[36:57.480 --> 37:01.120]  Don't central banks rule the world as MSNBC said and all the guests agreed, yes they
[37:01.120 --> 37:15.480]  do 117 million LinkedIn email addresses and passwords put up for sale and the answer is
[37:15.480 --> 37:22.000]  change your password frequently, often and then some more and make it complex and not
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  stupid.
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.600]  I know some people have the same passcode they had 15 years ago.
[37:27.600 --> 37:32.200]  You are crazy and you wonder why your identity is being stolen all the time.
[37:32.200 --> 37:33.200]  Change your passcodes.
[37:33.200 --> 37:39.520]  We're going to get all of that coming up.
[37:39.520 --> 37:45.920]  More quakes rumble Northwest Volcanoes, King News.
[37:45.920 --> 37:50.640]  Oregon's Mount Hood has seen about 40 earthquakes since Monday in close proximity over less
[37:50.640 --> 37:51.640]  than 18 hours.
[37:51.640 --> 37:56.280]  Such clusters of earthquakes are known as Schwarm, the location of the quakes is in
[37:56.280 --> 38:02.080]  the southern flank of the volcano, they are small, 2.0s or less, but this happened last
[38:02.080 --> 38:07.880]  time Mount St. Helens blew up, there's a more detailed article at infowars.com by Michael
[38:07.880 --> 38:12.680]  Schneider, major eruption imminent earthquake swarms reported at Mount Hood, Mount Rainier
[38:12.680 --> 38:13.960]  and Mount St. Helens.
[38:13.960 --> 38:19.720]  I'm going to get into that more, researchers diversity and soil imperative for supporting
[38:19.720 --> 38:26.000]  ecosystems and all over the world, the soil is dying because of the chemicals and things
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.680]  that are being added, and that's a infowars.com article by Christina Sarich who does such
[38:32.680 --> 38:37.760]  a great job, earthworms enrich the soil, pesticides harm it, and we're turning into
[38:37.760 --> 38:42.840]  a big dust bowl, obviously, I'm not against technology, but it's being misused, misappropriated
[38:42.840 --> 38:47.880]  and we're strip mining the planet, we're more worried about carbon dioxide limiting
[38:47.880 --> 38:51.560]  that that makes plants grow, that'll save us, just only worry about that, not all the
[38:51.560 --> 38:55.840]  thousands of serious issues, everything will be fine, never worry about the terra farming
[38:55.840 --> 39:01.960]  that's going on by whoever, the geoengineering by our loving elite.
[39:01.960 --> 39:05.320]  The feds are telling folks to make a grocery list and start stopping, stocking up with
[39:05.320 --> 39:09.920]  a week's worth of food, the examiner reports, they tell you how to shop, now we'll tell
[39:09.920 --> 39:15.000]  you how to tie your shoelaces, because public education is under such a good job, meddling
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.840]  in serious civil war worked out so well, now the Pentagon has decided to move back in with
[39:19.840 --> 39:25.160]  troops and air support, so they topple Gaddafi for no reason, bring al-Qaeda in, now they
[39:25.160 --> 39:28.640]  want to come in and quote, kick those guys out and put in some new government, this
[39:28.640 --> 39:36.720]  is absolutely insane, but if you're weapons sellers, it is a fabulous idea, White House
[39:36.720 --> 39:41.760]  cites executive privilege, keeps Obama aid from testifying about Iran nuclear deal, which
[39:41.760 --> 39:46.800]  is now admitted to be a complete lie against the American people, like Obamacare and everything
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.920]  else these scallywags engage in, Venezuela spends millions on incredibly dumb things
[39:52.920 --> 39:56.400]  while its economy collapses and the lights actually now are only on about an hour a day
[39:56.400 --> 40:01.120]  in many areas, and there's this mass looting and death every day, but college kids here
[40:01.120 --> 40:10.200]  dream of one day living in a place like Fidel Castro's Cuba or Hugo Chavez's wonderful,
[40:10.200 --> 40:18.360]  wonderful, wonderful, Venezuela, another article up on infowars.com by Paul Watson, Boris that's
[40:18.360 --> 40:22.120]  the guy running for prime minister in England, the former mayor of London is completely right,
[40:22.120 --> 40:25.720]  the EU was a Nazi brainchild, we go through all the main line history of it, now it was
[40:25.720 --> 40:30.440]  a Nazi plan and how the Nazis set up the Bilderberg group with the United States in England and
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.040]  set up the CIA national security structure so they could actually take over the United
[40:34.040 --> 40:40.120]  States, now not the Nazis, but the Nazi plan was adopted, you're just seeing a soft kill
[40:40.120 --> 40:45.440]  slow motion version of it and I know everybody's certainly enjoying the 3,000% increases in
[40:45.440 --> 40:51.840]  cancer, 2,000% increase in type 2 diabetes and massive 10,000% increase in pediatric
[40:51.840 --> 40:55.920]  cancers, the IQ is massively dropping, everyone walking around like drooling zombies, I'm
[40:55.920 --> 41:02.120]  sure you're enjoying it right, there's no weapon system attacking, everything's fine,
[41:02.120 --> 41:08.640]  everything's fine, move along, no the EU is a Nazi project and was established as the
[41:08.640 --> 41:12.560]  Nazis would have established it with their blueprint, with everything, breaking up the
[41:12.560 --> 41:17.000]  family, bringing in the Muslims, just all of it's a beautiful Nazi plan, and for the
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.240]  media quote to me it's a horrible plan, but you guys like it, so run the system, here's
[41:22.240 --> 41:26.040]  some interesting news, some good news, but then also some bad news, Washington Post,
[41:26.040 --> 41:32.200]  US judge strikes down DC concealed carry gun law as probably unconstitutional, they just
[41:32.200 --> 41:37.920]  let it as probably, so another judge has seconded the Supreme Court, Hillary says don't worry,
[41:37.920 --> 41:43.920]  I'm about to get a couple of new Supreme Court justices in when I win, Missouri lawmakers
[41:43.920 --> 41:47.640]  and so just remember the Republican leadership still wants Hillary to win instead of Trump,
[41:47.640 --> 41:51.480]  so just remember who they really are, Trump says he'll put people in like Scalia who are
[41:51.480 --> 41:58.320]  strict constructionist following the letter of the law, not what meaning can be twisted
[41:58.320 --> 42:05.040]  from its text, Missouri lawmakers passed stand your ground, no permit concealed carry, and
[42:05.040 --> 42:08.800]  that's good because areas that have gun control, we're seeing crime explode because the economy
[42:08.800 --> 42:12.600]  is going into the toilet, we've seen crime drop for 20 plus years, but now it's going
[42:12.600 --> 42:18.320]  to go up because the economy is falling apart, and the answer is to hold that violent crime
[42:18.320 --> 42:27.080]  wave down, get more citizens armed immediately, nine anti-gun bills advanced in California
[42:27.080 --> 42:34.920]  Senate, that's the bad news, that's from guns.com, the Democratic controlled state senate appropriations
[42:34.920 --> 42:39.880]  committee on Monday gave a rubber stamp to a shelf of measures that would change the
[42:39.880 --> 42:43.920]  landscape of gun laws in California, and of course it'll just basically ban most of your
[42:43.920 --> 42:47.680]  guns as they promise to do and register all the others so they can confiscate them and
[42:47.680 --> 42:50.840]  arrest gun owners, and there's a big list of them, and if you want to know what the
[42:50.840 --> 42:56.440]  feds are going to do under Hillary, this is the Bloomberg, Hillary, Soros, you know,
[42:56.440 --> 43:05.880]  Nazi collaborator wish list, and it is a nightmare, and if you lose a gun, you go to
[43:05.880 --> 43:15.120]  prison, it's just horrible, it funds all the gun grabbing groups with state money, it's
[43:15.120 --> 43:21.240]  bad, it's bad, again, bans a bunch of guns, just you want to go find out what their wish
[43:21.240 --> 43:25.760]  list is, it's nine anti-gun bills advanced in California, Senate, we're posting it up
[43:25.760 --> 43:33.240]  at info wars.com, oh, continuing, Interpol, 800,000 migrants ready to head to the EU in
[43:33.240 --> 43:39.400]  the latest group, and they admit they're full of ISIS fighters and jihadists, and 80% again
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.400]  are military aged men, I mean, look at this photo, none of them are women, it's military
[43:43.400 --> 43:51.400]  aged men, go north and west, my son, there you will find the winches and weak men that
[43:51.400 --> 43:57.360]  lay down to you in states that serve us, hahahaha, played the clips yesterday, and then the Germans
[43:57.360 --> 44:02.040]  at the leftist party meeting, almost all run by women, who'd have bags put over their heads
[44:02.040 --> 44:06.960]  at being slave dungeons under these Wahabiists, they have the women get them and go, soon
[44:06.960 --> 44:10.040]  Germany will no longer be German, there will be no more evil blue eyes, and the women
[44:10.040 --> 44:14.640]  are like, yeah, the German women, yeah, oh, we hate ourselves, oh, we hate ourselves,
[44:14.640 --> 44:20.040]  just sick, sick, freakish behavior, you think I'm kidding, it's in Paul Watson's report,
[44:20.040 --> 44:23.800]  like, can we find that, I forget the headline, I'm gonna put it on screen for new listeners
[44:23.800 --> 44:27.560]  who actually want to go see that video for yourself, and the Muslims saying we're here
[44:27.560 --> 44:32.120]  to get your women, you weak scum, I'm supposed to go, I'm liberal, you're right, kill me,
[44:32.120 --> 44:40.120]  I'm sorry, help me, I'm weak, let me continue, Obama spending millions to find summer jobs
[44:40.120 --> 44:45.440]  for refugees, that's out of the Egon news, and remember, it was reported last week by
[44:45.440 --> 44:52.760]  the Hill that they get more money per year than the highest paid Social Security recipients,
[44:52.760 --> 45:00.200]  so out of the gates, the refugees are getting almost $18,000 a year, and food stamps, and
[45:00.200 --> 45:09.200]  job preferences up front, sorry, here's another one, black Iowa student starts fight, loses,
[45:09.200 --> 45:14.360]  makes up, hate crimes, gets caught, that's the University of Iowa, shock waves across
[45:14.360 --> 45:18.160]  campus, turned out to be just another hoax, police said, they have the video of it, just
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.880]  look again, the guy saying they put fag on his birthday cake at Whole Foods in downtown
[45:22.880 --> 45:27.440]  Austin, and they have the surveillance footage, he did it, he wanted attention, but Whole
[45:27.440 --> 45:31.960]  Foods says it's okay, it was for a good cause, they just, they're like go do that to a little
[45:31.960 --> 45:36.840]  Christian bakery or something, don't do that to us, and the media will help cover it up,
[45:36.840 --> 45:42.600]  here it is out of the Gazette, no charges against the University of Iowa student, Marcus Owens
[45:42.600 --> 45:47.880]  for fabricating hate crime, then it gets into what he did, it says he got drunk and ran around
[45:47.880 --> 45:53.480]  starting altercations and attacking people, and then ran back and said that he had been
[45:53.480 --> 46:04.360]  attacked by white people, so I'm sorry, this is really funny, oh boy, 62 years after Brown
[46:04.360 --> 46:09.920]  versus Board of Education, court ordered schools to desegregate again, the black school has
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.880]  the highest in this report, highest grades in the independent school district system,
[46:14.880 --> 46:19.600]  which aren't independent, almost no one, they have the polls, who's in the school wants
[46:19.600 --> 46:23.480]  to go, there are some white Hispanic students, they're predominantly black, they have good
[46:23.480 --> 46:26.640]  discipline records, they're just a first rate school, they don't want to leave the school
[46:26.640 --> 46:30.520]  in their neighborhood, but now they're going to be bussed across town to a predominantly
[46:30.520 --> 46:37.720]  white school, and vice versa, vice versa, this is forced integration, folks, because
[46:37.720 --> 46:42.800]  it's going to create total implosion, and you watch, guarantee that a year or two of
[46:42.800 --> 46:45.840]  this happens, they say they're just going to swap the schools, and then finally tear
[46:45.840 --> 46:50.880]  down one of the black schools, which is predominantly black, that belongs to the community that
[46:50.880 --> 46:57.560]  they run, guarantee the test score is going to drop for everybody, so, and by the way,
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.080]  it's not segregated, if you're white or black, you can even ask and go to another school
[47:01.080 --> 47:04.720]  if you wanted to, they have that program there, they report, I spent some time researching
[47:04.720 --> 47:09.640]  this this morning, it's amazing, separately though, all over the country, minority groups,
[47:09.640 --> 47:13.320]  gay groups, whatever, are shelf-segregating, want their own areas, and then schools are
[47:13.320 --> 47:19.000]  giving them that when they want it, here's another report, Texas Governor, JFK wanted
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.720]  men on the moon, Obama wants men in the women's restrooms, Adon Salazar, infowars.com, that
[47:24.720 --> 47:30.360]  ties into the story that's up on DrudgeReport.com, it's an infowars.com exclusive, New York City
[47:30.360 --> 47:37.080]  to find businesses that don't use correct gender pronouns, failing to refer to transgenders
[47:37.080 --> 47:43.320]  as Z, or her, oh, got to use the word they say now, a violation of human rights, that's
[47:43.320 --> 47:47.800]  already in the colleges, in the banking forms, and they're telling kids in public school,
[47:47.800 --> 47:50.920]  they're telling five-year-olds, don't say he or she that, because I can't be a boring
[47:50.920 --> 47:54.240]  girl, totally confusing, I mean, when the kid goes to the counselor a few years later,
[47:54.240 --> 47:57.440]  says, well, I'm not a boring girl, they're like, we got a special after-school group
[47:57.440 --> 48:05.520]  for you, licking their lips, it's called pedophilia, Sandusky is proud, Sandusky is proud right
[48:05.520 --> 48:10.000]  now, so that story's up on infowars.com, we're going to be talking about that some.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.120]  CIE Watchdog, the whole reports accidentally destroyed a copy of the torture report, oh,
[48:15.120 --> 48:20.880]  I'm sure it was a complete and total accident, and it's an accident that the Rockefeller
[48:20.880 --> 48:25.840]  Foundation weaponized in 1954, the Zika virus, and then it was on the U.S. weapon shelves,
[48:25.840 --> 48:29.040]  and then now magically it's mutating, and it's weaponized, and spreading right in the
[48:29.040 --> 48:32.160]  middle of the new Olympics, coming up and spreading worldwide, and then it causes basically
[48:32.160 --> 48:37.160]  sterilization to form babies, and then folks are scared to have sexes and sexually transmitted,
[48:37.160 --> 48:43.160]  nothing going on, folks, drink your fluoride, drink your fluoride, okay, now, let me give
[48:43.160 --> 48:47.440]  you a really big news right now, when I'm going to come back and get into the election
[48:47.440 --> 48:53.440]  news that's ultra important as well, this story's on infowars.com, for no more fake
[48:53.440 --> 48:59.400]  news, and John Rappaport, I want to get on about it, and it links right to the New York
[48:59.400 --> 49:08.600]  Times, and it links right to the universities and Scripps, Howard News Service, I've told
[49:08.600 --> 49:14.040]  you this forever, because they said they were going to do it, and even when I saw a science
[49:14.040 --> 49:20.880]  fiction movie like 15 years ago, I forget the name, who's the guy in the Shawshank
[49:20.880 --> 49:28.240]  redemption that plays the accountant, what's his name, well, he starred in it, and it's
[49:28.240 --> 49:33.000]  in the future, and they give you a shot that goes in each part of your brain that makes
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.360]  you submit and be passive, but the elite get a shot that actually brain boasts them, you've
[49:37.360 --> 49:42.640]  seen that in the new born supremacy movie, the born legacy, well, they really have studies
[49:42.640 --> 49:46.840]  on that going back 20 years, so writers know about the scientific stuff going on, so they
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.260]  put it in science fiction movies, the media allows it to come out, the government does
[49:50.260 --> 49:55.400]  it because it conditions you and gets you ready for it, but the last 10 years or so
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.280]  they've been admitting that they're going to have behavior vaccines, stress vaccines,
[50:00.280 --> 50:06.480]  anti-drug, anti-addiction vaccines that aren't vaccines, vaccine is just a word where you
[50:06.480 --> 50:12.120]  get learned immunity from an attenuated or dead or weakened strain of a virus or a bacteria,
[50:12.120 --> 50:20.600]  I know you know that, but under the rubric of that, it is DNA altering human live mutation,
[50:20.600 --> 50:27.600]  which is called cancer, live mutation inside the body, which if you study, they say never
[50:27.600 --> 50:31.280]  do because it's connected to cancer and is really, really dangerous, and it's already
[50:31.280 --> 50:34.640]  going on, they're already adding this to vaccines, there's already social conditioning going
[50:34.640 --> 50:39.000]  on, that's all folks get vaccines and it's more than just the aluminum and things in
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.120]  it that they're not themselves anymore, because live viruses that are artificial, they're
[50:44.120 --> 50:47.960]  basically nanotech, this is in studies, are being put in, that's why so many goes, gets
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.200]  a shot and suddenly it's never there again, they're there, they work, but they're like
[50:51.200 --> 50:57.400]  dead because there is a zombie apocalypse already going on, I hope the media makes a
[50:57.400 --> 51:00.200]  joke out of this because it's serious.
[51:00.200 --> 51:06.560]  You know about RVs, you've heard about bunkers, but surviving is not recreation and man wasn't

[52:05.560 --> 52:08.800]  I guess like 20 plus hours, tell us what brainforce did.
[52:08.800 --> 52:13.120]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[52:13.120 --> 52:17.360]  at 830, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make
[52:17.360 --> 52:20.880]  it, and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brainforce
[52:20.880 --> 52:24.880]  right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later it's like bing, everything
[52:24.880 --> 52:26.480]  just kind of clears up.
[52:26.480 --> 52:31.080]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why third
[52:31.080 --> 52:35.840]  party, nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best
[52:35.840 --> 52:39.240]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[52:39.240 --> 52:42.200]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done
[52:42.200 --> 52:43.200]  it without brainforce.
[52:43.200 --> 52:48.480]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce
[52:48.480 --> 52:49.480]  and came in.
[52:49.480 --> 52:59.640]  You will find brainforce and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[52:59.640 --> 53:03.840]  Think about this, your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to
[53:03.840 --> 53:08.840]  be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine
[53:08.840 --> 53:12.880]  and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[53:12.880 --> 53:17.440]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[53:17.440 --> 53:21.280]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted big Berkey water filter.

[54:10.560 --> 54:18.240]  The actor was Tim Robbins, the film was code 462003 and will put the IMDB up on screen
[54:18.240 --> 54:22.920]  for TV viewers, I'll describe it for radio listeners, and the government uses viruses
[54:22.920 --> 54:27.600]  to program people's brains for social control.
[54:27.600 --> 54:31.560]  So again, we'll put that article up on screen for TV viewers so people can actually check
[54:31.560 --> 54:32.560]  it out for themselves.
[54:32.560 --> 54:39.800]  We didn't have time to print it, if you scroll down I'll actually read from the description
[54:39.800 --> 54:40.800]  on the plot.
[54:40.800 --> 54:42.720]  Yeah, just click story line.
[54:42.720 --> 54:46.920]  Code 46 is a love story set in a brave new world type near future where cities are heavily
[54:46.920 --> 54:50.320]  controlled and only accessible through checkpoints.
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.360]  People cannot travel unless they have paperless papers.
[54:55.360 --> 54:59.040]  Words and sentences in many languages, especially Spanish, French and Chinese are mixed with
[54:59.040 --> 55:00.960]  English in this new world.
[55:00.960 --> 55:06.560]  A special travel permit issued by the totalitarian government, the Sphinx, outside these cities
[55:06.560 --> 55:11.600]  the desert has taken over the shantytowns and jammed with non-citizens, people without
[55:11.600 --> 55:18.280]  IDs forced to live their lives and then it goes on to break down, I've seen the film
[55:18.280 --> 55:22.400]  how they use viruses injected into people to basically control them and dumb them down.
[55:22.400 --> 55:26.200]  You guys print me the whole bio on that.
[55:26.200 --> 55:30.840]  Now continuing here, or print me a better review, that's just some anonymous review
[55:30.840 --> 55:31.840]  that didn't do too good a job.
[55:31.840 --> 55:35.280]  The whole point of the film is about the viruses and I saw it like over a decade ago, I'm going
[55:35.280 --> 55:40.920]  from memory, but here is the real issue and if I can talk about a movie and get people
[55:40.920 --> 55:44.000]  to pay attention, I will because I want to do a review on this.
[55:44.000 --> 55:48.120]  It was probably a decade ago as well that I did a special video report called Brain
[55:48.120 --> 55:52.400]  Eating Vaccines, that's a shock name because that's what they do.
[55:52.400 --> 55:58.600]  They call them behavior vaccines, anti-depression vaccines, stress vaccines, anti-addiction
[55:58.600 --> 56:03.120]  vaccines and there's a bunch of different families of these.
[56:03.120 --> 56:08.280]  But most of them create antibodies that block chemicals in your body associated with euphoria.
[56:08.280 --> 56:13.120]  So yeah, heroin doesn't get you high anymore, but you also never get excited and you're
[56:13.120 --> 56:20.800]  a total sad sack and it's linked to depression and suicide.
[56:20.800 --> 56:25.760]  But still they have other classes that are viral that go in and actually destroy, that
[56:25.760 --> 56:33.160]  eat, that replicate on certain areas of the brain and give you a tailored viral lobotomy.
[56:33.160 --> 56:38.760]  Basically viral meningitis, genetically engineered viral meningitis to go in and target certain
[56:38.760 --> 56:39.760]  areas of your brain.
[56:39.760 --> 56:42.000]  Now you know the global assertive social control.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.640]  It's in the news that Obama does whatever Google says and Google's gaming everything
[56:45.640 --> 56:49.600]  for the Democrats and the globalist and it's in the news that they meet with Zuckerberg
[56:49.600 --> 56:50.600]  and they game everything.
[56:50.600 --> 56:53.760]  They've all been caught, it's all out in the open that they're scamming you.
[56:53.760 --> 56:57.720]  Of course if they're putting fluoride in the water since the mid-40s to brain damage you
[56:57.720 --> 57:02.960]  and lower fertility and the White House science czar wrote a book about it in 1974, the year
[57:02.960 --> 57:06.680]  I was born, what do you think they're doing now?
[57:06.680 --> 57:09.280]  Don't take their vaccines.
[57:09.280 --> 57:12.480]  Don't be afraid of all the other diseases and things that are out there that they claim
[57:12.480 --> 57:14.120]  vaccines protect you from.
[57:14.120 --> 57:17.720]  Most of the time they make you more susceptible to what they claim they're fighting whether
[57:17.720 --> 57:19.800]  it shingles or whooping cough.
[57:19.800 --> 57:20.800]  Look it up.
[57:20.800 --> 57:24.680]  But let's say there were real vaccines out there that could actually help you.
[57:24.680 --> 57:26.440]  They don't want to help you.
[57:26.440 --> 57:28.720]  They're bringing any legals in mass.
[57:28.720 --> 57:32.920]  They now have record levels of tuberculosis all over the United States.
[57:32.920 --> 57:36.240]  That was in the news yesterday.
[57:36.240 --> 57:38.000]  Minnesota is the worst hit.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.120]  If you pull that up, it's incredible.
[57:40.120 --> 57:42.360]  You think they really care about you?
[57:42.360 --> 57:43.360]  They're not going to give you real vaccines.
[57:43.360 --> 57:44.800]  They're not going to give you real technology.
[57:44.800 --> 57:48.360]  They're doing everything they can to block you.
[57:48.360 --> 57:53.200]  And only a revolt by the citizens, the scientists, the doctors, the researchers, learning about
[57:53.200 --> 57:55.920]  this and saying we want access to the real stuff.
[57:55.920 --> 57:57.880]  Only that will turn this around.
[57:57.880 --> 58:01.600]  But let me tell you, the new vaccines, the reason they're giving national liability protection
[58:01.600 --> 58:05.320]  and the reason they're so secretive and allowed to keep it secret is because they're adding
[58:05.320 --> 58:11.880]  Trojan horse stuff, viruses, cancer viruses, nanotech, microplasms, you name it, in a bunch
[58:11.880 --> 58:13.320]  of secret testing.
[58:13.320 --> 58:19.720]  They admit they've used vaccines to test stuff on the public, including lethal pathogens.
[58:19.720 --> 58:22.480]  Secret testing's been declassified.
[58:22.480 --> 58:23.640]  Everybody knows about Tuskegee.
[58:23.640 --> 58:26.800]  There's thousands of things bigger than that.
[58:26.800 --> 58:32.640]  In the US code, they say for law enforcement or any testing purposes, they can kill you.
[58:32.640 --> 58:37.080]  They also have it on the books, they can cancel elections and arrest people en masse.
[58:37.080 --> 58:40.200]  Well, I say that's a fraud and I'm standing up against it.
[58:40.200 --> 58:42.840]  And by the way, Salon's back saying pedophilia's good.
[58:42.840 --> 58:46.760]  Oh yeah, this is how sick these filth are.
[58:46.760 --> 58:47.760]  They hate us.
[58:47.760 --> 58:48.760]  I'm proud of that.
[58:48.760 --> 58:49.760]  Uh, yeah.
[58:49.760 --> 58:54.800]  First of all, I want to say, secret 12, that's two, two for male, brain, force, prostagart,
[58:54.800 --> 58:55.800]  silver bullet.
[58:55.800 --> 58:56.800]  I use them all.
[58:56.800 --> 58:57.800]  They're phenomenal.
[58:57.800 --> 58:58.800]  They work.
[58:58.800 --> 58:59.800]  Buy them, folks.
[58:59.800 --> 59:00.800]  Thanks, brother.
[59:00.800 --> 59:01.800]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[59:01.800 --> 59:07.720]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[59:07.720 --> 59:08.720]  Um, I have one.
[59:08.720 --> 59:09.720]  Welcome to the Info War.
[59:09.720 --> 59:14.320]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War
[59:14.320 --> 59:15.320]  at the same time.
[59:15.320 --> 59:16.320]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[59:16.320 --> 59:19.320]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Acutefx, uh, Nacin, Ida, Ida.
[59:19.320 --> 59:20.320]  Why?
[59:20.320 --> 59:21.320]  God, let me ask you a question.
[59:21.320 --> 59:22.320]  Have they worked for you?
[59:22.320 --> 59:24.960]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[59:24.960 --> 59:25.960]  What products are you taking?
[59:25.960 --> 59:26.960]  Are you taking?
[59:26.960 --> 59:32.400]  I'm, uh, super male, to, uh, brain force, to winter sun, uh, X2.
[59:32.400 --> 59:36.800]  Even got a little, uh, DNA force, so, and I just free up everything and I just went
[59:36.800 --> 59:37.800]  to auto-built.
[59:37.800 --> 59:43.040]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[59:43.040 --> 59:51.600]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[59:51.600 --> 01:00:10.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.880]  I see your hair is burning.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.880]  It's a filled fire.
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.880]  Come on, sit yourself with the truth.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.960]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.280]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:27.280]  I see your hair is burning.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.280]  It's a filled with fire.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.280]  If they say I never loved you.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.280]  You know they were a lion.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280]  You know they are a lion.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:44.280]  I just, uh, tried to quickly drink some more bottom of mineral fusion from infowarslife.com
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:50.120]  and spilt it down the front of my jacket, but there are worse things to do than that.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.760]  Like absorbing invisible, undetectable by traditional methods, radiation all over the
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:03.360]  world, concentrated in the western world.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.520]  We're going to be breaking all of that down with Dr. Edward Group with some huge news
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.000]  coming up in the next segment.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.320]  But I want to make a big deal out of this because I've made a big deal about this over
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]  the years.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.600]  I've studied the globalists and their social control, their ruthlessness, how cunning they
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.680]  are, how bold they are.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.960]  They admitted in mainstream news a year after the fact that the H1N1 virus had been a simulated
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.880]  virus in a vaccine a year before.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.680]  It was actually just a false positive virus to create hysteria and cover up other more
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:40.160]  deadly flu viruses that were going around at the time to push a special synthetic vaccine
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.000]  that the establishment wanted people to take worldwide.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.840]  Now, we don't know specifically what was going on, but we know in special trials of
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.920]  subdivisions of the vaccine, there were deaths in Poland, deaths in Czechoslovakia, deaths
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.080]  in the UK.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.280]  In some cases, a third of the people or more they get the vaccine to would die.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.880]  Just type in a homeless die in Poland.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.960]  And you see the number where they give it to, I think it was 50, and then a huge number
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960]  of them die.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.960]  I'm going from memory.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.040]  But you cannot make this stuff up.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.440]  And then I have this article.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:18.320]  Two vaccines will permanently alter human DNA.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.880]  Consider this article in light of the accelerating push to mandate and enforce vaccines and
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.160]  vaccination across the planet.
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:30.240]  The reference in the New York Times 31515 protection without a vaccine.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.120]  It describes the frontier of research here, the key quote that illustrates the use of
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.320]  the synthetic genes to promote against diseases while challenging and changing the genetic
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.000]  makeup of the humans.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.600]  This is not science fiction.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.000]  And again, they have the vaccines that go in and actually alter your brain to make you
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.640]  submit that they say this, they're going to make you better with a shot and they just
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.640]  say it real calmly.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.960]  And if they tell moms to do it, your daughter's going to be well behaved, they'll shoot their
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.400]  daughters up and the media lack like it's totally normal when your daughter becomes basically
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  an unfeeling zombie.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.800]  They commit suicide five years later and no one will help you then.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.680]  They'll just tell you a good job like with the Gardasil, you know, she dies three days
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.880]  later or she has a convulsion, never walks again, they'll just quietly pay you out for
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.320]  the big secret vaccine fund of taxpayers money because this is an overall agenda.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.680]  Your daughter wasn't meant to die three days later.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:28.640]  She was meant to become sterile down the road and die at 30, not at 12.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.240]  But you got to break a few eggs with a soft kill to be strong enough to kill you 20 years
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.760]  down the road, it's going to kill some people on the spot.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.840]  So take your shots and if you work for the system and the government, be delusional, feel
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.880]  like you're part of the power structure, hate me, say I'm a liar and roll up your sleeves
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.260]  and prepare to be brain damaged because I'm not lying.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.520]  I have the facts.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.080]  I know we're living in a science fiction dystopic nightmare.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.880]  We're entering it, but because there's so much good stuff in the world still as nightfalls
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.800]  as the tyranny creeps in, a lot of folks aren't noticing because they're too busy mesmerized
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:15.880]  by the brainwashing quite of the Newark Times by delivering synthetic genes into the muscles
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.680]  of experimental monkeys.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:23.560]  Just like it was monkey kidneys that gave 98 million Americans according to the federal
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:30.280]  government cancer, SV 40, and that was just one special immortal cell gene line that gave
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:37.120]  you so much pleasure and suck so much money out of so many millions of families, but I'm
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.120]  sorry.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.040]  Let's read the Newark Times.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:45.200]  By delivering synthetic genes to the muscles of the experimental monkeys, the scientists
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.160]  are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist the sissies.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.720]  Yes, we're going to make you better.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.720]  Of course, you're only getting sicker, but never mind that, we're going to make you
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.720]  better.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.640]  I'll take the shots.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:05.520]  We have another in a long list of fake hate crimes, this time being reported by KVU News
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.520]  in Austin.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.800]  The man who said an employee at Whole Foods wrote a homophobic slur on a cake as withdrawn
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:16.280]  his lawsuit and now says that the company, quote, did nothing wrong.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.040]  Jordan Brown made the initial allegations more than three weeks ago.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.680]  He said at the time that he ordered a cake with the phrase, love wins on it, but instead
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.120]  got a cake with a homophobic slur.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.720]  Whole Foods has now dropped their countersuit after, quote, the truth has come to light in,
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.600]  quote, according to a statement from the company.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:38.960]  Brown said in a statement Monday morning that he was wrong to pursue the matter and use
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.080]  the media to perpetrate the story.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:45.360]  He went on to apologize to Whole Foods and its team members for questioning their commitment
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.360]  to values.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.920]  Brown's apology came after Whole Foods released a video debunking Brown's story.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:59.080]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.160]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion from infowarslife.com.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:07.160]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.640]  and affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:16.520]  The all-new vitamin mineral fusion drink mix at infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:22.080]  supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.520]  In the history of infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.960]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.840]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today, with its unique delivery
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.640]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:44.000]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.400]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.160]  quality lab standard.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.600]  That means it's clean.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.600]  That means it's pure.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.680]  That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.680]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.880]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.680]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.920]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.440]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:24.760]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.440]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.440]  vitality.
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.440]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:39.040]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:45.880]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.160]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.080]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.960]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:03.960]  with Anthroplex.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.080]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m., the 3 p.m. central, I'm your host Alex Jones with
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:38.880]  my great crew of researchers and fellow patriots who are here raising the alarm as
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:47.760]  modern Paul reveals that we are falling into a worldwide technological overwrite, a technocracy,
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.560]  a world government.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.960]  But your human choices and being aware of this can reverse it.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:59.880]  That's why I'm here desperately trying to simply fire the flare gun in the air so you
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.080]  can look around you and decide for yourself, is humanity under attack?
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.360]  Is humanity being suppressed?
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:15.640]  And then the final question, are you going to lay down in the ditch and submit to this
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.920]  tyranny and slowly die?
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:23.080]  And watch all the work of our ancestors come to nothing and allow the people like Zuckerberg
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:29.000]  and other predatory creatures to steal the birthright of humanity?
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.360]  The question lies before you.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.840]  My good friend, Dr. Edward Group, is in studio with us a little bit into the next hour, and
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:42.640]  then we have other guests joining us today, Victor Ostrowski, a high-level famous member
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.000]  of Mossad who has exposed false flags, corruption in his own government, our government, you
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.600]  name it, white slavery sex rings, this guy really is a hero, he is going to be joining
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.560]  us today for 30 minutes, then Roger Stone had technical difficulties because they keep
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.720]  hacking into any new computer he gets, he's a very savvy guy, it's in the news today that
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.280]  foreign governments are hacking all the major campaigns.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.520]  Well, it's known that Stone got Paul Manfred in there, he's got the new pollster in there,
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.400]  that's one of his best friends, it's in the news today that the media says, oh, it looks
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.360]  like Stone's really the head of the campaign.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.160]  No, Trump's the head of the campaign, but yes, Stone is as influential as anybody, and
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.080]  so obviously they're breaking into his computer, so we're having to really do some countermeasures
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.960]  and have folks with computers each time come to him to even be able to get him on.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.400]  He gets on his computer, people jump on it, start surfing on it, start downloading stuff,
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.560]  I mean, this is serious, and it's actually on Drudge Report today actually dealing with
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:45.280]  that Intel chief, foreign hackers spying on campaigns, and that is in the Associated Press
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.280]  today.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:52.160]  Some folks are like, oh, nobody's breaking into Roger Stone's computer, no one wants
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:59.760]  to get into the Carl Rove for Donald Trump, the presidential frontrunner's computer.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:06.120]  Nobody wants to get into Donald Trump's political brain, oh no, that's not a target, and I'm
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.840]  sure the White House isn't a target, and I'm sure Hillary Clinton's email isn't a target,
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.440]  turns out she's been hacked, of course she was hacked, depending on said of course she
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.800]  was hacked two years ago, and it turned out all these governments were in there.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.000]  She knew that, why would she have all that secret stuff on an unshielded computer on
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.920]  purpose to leak info?
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.400]  That's a famous way to sell data but not get caught, you know, you don't go to the park
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.960]  and drop it off under the bench like a lot of other people, you know, got caught doing,
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.320]  what the NSA and CIA ain't going to prison for life, you just put stuff on a server,
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:41.240]  oh gee, I didn't know all these foreign groups are getting on, all these foundations, and
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.640]  then they give you hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:50.520]  The Gulf States gave her 100 plus million alone, she's gotten billions, she's been a
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.280]  spy on the CIA since she was 18 years old, that's been declassified.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.240]  Her and Clinton are in arranged marriage, we know the name of their section chief when
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:05.840]  they were in London, infiltrating the Russians, and so she is a spy on purpose, shelling data
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.640]  or leaking data, who knows, might be disinfo, but it doesn't matter, I know she's after
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.160]  our guns, I know she wants to shut down our power plants, I know she wants forced inoculations,
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.920]  I know she's an enemy of this country, now.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.160]  Coming up, I'm a pedophile, infowars.com reports, Trish Revolt reports as well, I'm
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:28.160]  a pedophile but not a monster, says the salon writer, can you believe that?
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.800]  Clinton pushes pedophile sympathy again, that's like five, six articles every month I've been
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.560]  seeing, I'm a pedophile, not a monster, and I actually have this slimy guy on about how
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:44.760]  he's attracted to kids, and he does videos now, so I can't even look at him, just look
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:50.680]  at that disgusting person, I mean I have three children, and you bet, I discriminate against
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.800]  pedophiles, the UN wants to legalize it, I know you have small children, you can comment
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:13:01.200]  on this but then I want to get into your huge breaking news, and then, new vaccines will
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:05.480]  permanently alter human DNA, the New York Times, an excellent John Rappaport boil down
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.040]  article giving you more of the story, this is what I've been horrified of for 20 years,
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.400]  but now it's here, they always had them, but now, vaccines that go in and quote, alter
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:19.440]  your DNA forever and change your entire genetic history, so this is the government vandalizing
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:25.000]  our genetics just like they admit GMO crops leak into the DNA, so folks, we are being
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.520]  jacked with mega massively, God knows what this is going to do, the mutations, the cancers
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.840]  are already off the chart because of a cocktail of reasons, the elite are testing on us to
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.320]  find secrets for themselves, we're the lab rats, we're the guinea pigs, everything they
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:53.160]  do is multifaceted, but what do you call this, media pushes vaccines that destroy your genetic
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:59.120]  legacy, that alter who you are, that change your behavior?
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.040]  Government pushes vaccines that give you a lobotomy, I mean, that's what the stress
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:09.800]  vaccines do, they're here, it's happening, but first, I want to ask Dr. Group this question
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.200]  because he's more of a journalist than even the many degrees he has and the clinics he
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.840]  runs and he's one of the biggest pharmaceutical producers in the country, one of the biggest
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:24.560]  designers, highly respected, and I'm so honored to work with him at m4slife.com, we know that
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.200]  in the Northern Hemisphere, it had doubled since the Manhattan Project by Chernobyl
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:34.320]  in the mid-80s, 86, now, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, anybody
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:40.120]  can look this up, 93% of reactors, of the 600 plus reactors, 400 plus power producers
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:45.520]  are leaking, in the window there's a lot of secret reactors as well, a lot of spacecraft,
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.400]  they've had reactors in because of the public, they don't tell them that's been admitted,
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.040]  so who knows, 600 admitted reactors, two in Austin, general publics totally doesn't
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:57.560]  even know there's one of the biggest research reactors in the world in North Austin, the
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.840]  JJ Pickle Center, they don't know there's an old reactor from the 50s under the UT
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.360]  facilities, by the tower, people can see the spokes tax, my dad's been in it when he was
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:12.760]  in plan two in high school, already at UT, so it's kind of like out of sight out of
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.880]  mind, we're here with reactors, they never shut it off by the way, you can't shut them
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:23.000]  off, they've got the big one in North Austin, but 93% of them are leaking, CBS said a decade
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.960]  ago, 75% are leaking, but you can look it up, 93% are leaking, and they're leaking things
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:34.160]  that aren't detectable by Geiger counters or field monitors, so I want to ask you before
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:40.280]  you get into this and break it all down, Dr. Edward Group, why doesn't the elite care,
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.880]  30, 40 years ago, I've studied it, I know you have as well, we've talked about this,
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:49.080]  they at least tried to contain them, they tried to not have leaks, but now, Mambiat,
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:54.240]  the head eugenicist liberal in England, he says we should thank nuclear reactors and
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.880]  have more of them, so it's entered a very nihilistic, kind of like these roulette parties where
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.880]  one person has AIDS or HIV and everybody tries to get it, and heterosexuals now want
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.320]  to die too, it's very trendy, the sexiest women want to die, it's very macabre, we're
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:13.680]  not joking folks, this is happening, what is this, I mean, they've got enough nukes
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.440]  to blow the planet up 10 times, why not just get it over with now, what do you think's
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.440]  going on?
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:22.920]  Well, you have the oil and gas industry, which is a trillion dollar industry, you have the
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.960]  pharmaceutical industry, which is a trillion dollar industry, and then you have the nuclear
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:34.600]  power, a nuclear weapon industry, which believe it or not, nuclear power plants are extremely
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:40.400]  profitable, they don't care about what's going to happen to the people, they don't care
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.600]  about what's going to be leaking into the air and the water, they're just worried about
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:50.600]  profitability, and they're very profitable, and not only that, it's a population control
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:56.880]  mechanism, if you look at the spoken hub model that we always talk about, you have nuclear
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:03.080]  radiation, which nobody can see, nobody can measure a lot of it, especially the individual
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.960]  people, a lot of times you don't see high level political people or the globalists or
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.920]  people that know about the damaging effects of radiation that live by these, they already
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.640]  know, so they're not going to live next to or in the 100 mile or 200 mile radius of nuclear
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:25.080]  power plants, and so I think that that has a lot to do with it, and China for example
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:30.400]  is building 20 floating nuclear power plants right now, they're going to be floating in
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.960]  the ocean, and of course they're famous for dumping waste, that way they can just dump
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:39.240]  it, no one's there to monitor it, I mean this is insane, yeah it's insane and it's just
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:42.840]  another reason, even though there are a lot of good things that are happening right now
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.160]  in the world, there's also all of these nuclear power plants, a lot of them that were built
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.480]  in the 1920s, 30s, 40s, and mainline environmentalists are all over the news saying, we love nuclear,
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.640]  get rid of coal plants that are totally clean, but a carbon dioxide plants need, we're at
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.760]  a carbon-starved level, it's almost like science fiction, like they're space aliens,
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.880]  they want a radioactive environment and don't like carbon dioxide, and I'm not saying that's
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.320]  what's happening, but they're like terraforming us, cutting off the carbon, making everything
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:14.480]  radioactive, spraying radioactive isotopes in the air, that's declassified, we're going
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.400]  to skip this break as I cut into your time, please continue Dr. Griffin, there's something
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.520]  behind this.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:26.720]  Well, what's behind it I think is, the scary thing about radiation is the half-life, I
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.880]  mean these things are radioactive, can be for millions of years, for example you have
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:39.080]  cesium, strontium, radioactive iodine, you have plutonium, uranium, all of these things
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:47.120]  that can damage the environment, the earth, the soil, the human body, for the whole history
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.440]  of the earth, I mean that's how damaging these things are, but one of the things that not
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:57.320]  too many people are talking about and one of the things that is starting to be more reported
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:02.720]  on is the tritium, and most people say tritium, what's that, you know, all we hear about is
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:07.000]  radioactive iodine, that's right, let's get into the stuff that is very hard to detect,
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.200]  but just as deadly.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:16.440]  So tritium is actually radioactive hydrogen, and hydrogen is the main component in water
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.800]  and air, and it's really scary when you think about it because I started doing the research
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:28.200]  especially with the tritium leaks that were detected at Biscayne Bay down in Miami, as
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:34.880]  a matter of fact just about every single nuclear power plant is releasing tritium.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.480]  What is tritium?
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.800]  Tritium is basically radioactive hydrogen, radioactive water.
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:47.200]  Now with most toxic radioactive materials, they're going to accumulate in the tissue,
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.320]  you know, for example with cesium and strontium and radioactive iodine, you're going to have
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:55.960]  problems with your thyroid gland, that's why we're seeing thyroid dysfunction through
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.360]  the roof all over the world right now.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:03.120]  Listen, I was at a Kirby Lane and now I'm paying attention, suddenly young people, especially
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:07.320]  women, they just have these big goiters hanging under their necks, I know that's the fluoride
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.840]  in the water doing that partially, but what's going on?
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.840]  So it depends on what part of the world or what part of the United States that you're
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.840]  living in.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:21.640]  I mean, just for example, up in Indian Point in New York, the reactor's been leaking heavily,
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.400]  it's leaking tritium into the Hudson River, all those people around there you're starting
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.400]  to see.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.160]  By the way, while you're talking, we're even putting mainstream news headlines up with
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.160]  what you're saying.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.520]  This is not your opinion, for radio listeners, he has a stack of documents, articles in front
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.520]  of him.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:40.560]  Right, and because anything that I think is a major health concern, obviously, like you,
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.280]  we want to report on it so people can contact their local authorities, contact the government,
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:47.280]  not like they're going to do anything about it.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.760]  Well, more need on this is good.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:52.840]  I mean, it's just education, the more people know about it, they can protect themselves
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.840]  as well.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:54.840]  And that's NBC News.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:59.120]  Radioactive Tritium leaks found at 48 U.S. nuke sites, so they wonder why cancer is exploding
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.120]  off the chart.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:05.800]  So the problem with tritium is, these tritium is not measured at these nuclear sites because
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:12.560]  you cannot pick it up with a Geiger counter, and these nuclear facilities are not regulated
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.200]  to where they have to look at tritium levels.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:19.880]  The EPA comes in and during inspections and looks for tritium levels in the soil and nearby
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:26.560]  lakes and nearby water sources, but nope, they're actually, it's legal for these nuclear
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:34.120]  power plants to release tritium into the water and into the soil, and it's become a
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.120]  problem.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.400]  That's right, they have allowable levels, and within a month of Fukushima happening,
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.280]  we can actually pull up articles on this.
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.560]  We wrote stories about it.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:44.680]  The EPA came out and said, we're going to raise the levels of what we say safe.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:49.680]  Some isotopes, they raise them 2,500 times.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.640]  And then they also allowed them to keep secret now when they dump.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.240]  Used to alarms would go off.
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.880]  So now they're on lakes and streams and oceans just dumping.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.280]  So the problem with tritium is you just, you're walking around, you're breathing it through
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.480]  the air because these big smoke stacks that come out of the nuclear facilities, most of
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.680]  it's releasing tritium.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.800]  So it gets into the air, you breathe it in, it's hydrogen, so it goes directly through
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:18.080]  your skin, it gets into the water, it gets into the soil, so plants can become radioactive
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.280]  as well.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:23.520]  It's a major concern because if you look at some of the other radioactive materials,
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.240]  they might attack the bones, let's say, or they might attack the thyroid gland.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:31.160]  Unfortunately, tritium attacks the DNA.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:38.040]  When tritium decomposes in the body, it releases 18,000 electron volts.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:44.000]  And those electron volts attack the DNA, so it attacks every single cell in your body.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.960]  And now they're releasing vaccines that attack your DNA.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:51.680]  I mean, that's in the New York Times, but because they care about us, come on, I understand
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:56.360]  these companies don't care, it's about profits, but at a certain point, you know, they told
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.960]  a CEO, will detonate a doomsday bomb that blows the whole planet up, but will pay you
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:01.960]  all the money in the world.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.160]  You'll be dead and can't spend it, but you would have been the richest man in the world.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.160]  Would he still hit the button?
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.440]  Yeah, that's a tough question.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.240]  Because I mean, they admit radiation is going off the chart, it's killing people, the elite's
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:19.960]  kids are dying, they're dying, I mean, there's something beyond this, satanic force and
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:25.200]  energy, because people used to care more destruction of the planet.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.320]  You were talking about the soil, destruction of the soil.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:31.240]  If you destroy the soil, then you can't grow any food.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.880]  That's why everybody's moving to greenhouses now, because it's so hard to trees are dying.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.080]  The oxygen concentration in the planet is going down, it used to be a 28%.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.600]  Now in some places, it's down to six or 8%.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.920]  Oxygen, all over the hill, most of the trees are dying.
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:47.920]  That's right.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.800]  You don't know why, and first it was the oaks, now it's the other trees.
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:56.680]  And they admit that aluminum's exploding and they're spraying us with it.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.440]  So not only do you have it, yes, it's a day loop.
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.320]  I cannot believe we have this evil elite.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.680]  I mean, they are so evil.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.000]  They should not, just the word nuclear is evil.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.720]  And also with nuclear weapons, Tridium is used in every single nuclear weapon as well,
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.800]  because it's the trigger for nuclear weapons.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.880]  So how do you protect yourself?
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:21.320]  I think one of the reasons also that we're seeing-
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.320]  I show the mutated plants and animals.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:28.160]  So these are the, this is what's happened with Fukushima, the mutations.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:34.360]  You have plants, this is, again, you don't get mutations like this unless your DNA is
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:39.480]  affected, the core genetic structure of the planet, of the food.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.480]  Look at that strawberry.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.920]  That's a strawberry with like two heads on it.
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:43.920]  Three heads.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.920]  Right.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:53.160]  Like eggplants growing with tomatoes, different, you know, weird veins and structures on lettuces.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.920]  And by the way, when these things see-
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.440]  Yeah, that's the skeleton of the lettuce on the outside.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.440]  Look at-
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:24:59.440]  Leaves coming out of tomatoes.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.240]  Leaves actually coming out of tomatoes.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:05.320]  Well, that's what happens when they feed the BT corn to guinea pigs.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.880]  By the second generation, they have testicles on top of their heads, hair on their tongues.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.880]  Right.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:11.880]  Tails growing out the side.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:12.880]  But it's okay.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:13.880]  They love us.
[01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:14.880]  They love us.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:15.880]  That's what DARPA is for, right?
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:16.880]  I mean, they're doing all that trans-
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880]  What is those?
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.880]  What are those?
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880]  I don't even know what that is.
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.880]  Look at that sunflower.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.880]  Some fruit that they're-
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.880]  Look at that.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.880]  Go back to that sunflower.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.880]  That was crazy.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:25.880]  Look at that sunflower.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.880]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:27.880]  Look at the sunflower with all the different heads on it.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:28.880]  So that was a human that had like 10 heads.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.880]  Right.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.880]  I actually have some pictures of-
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.760]  You know, I guarantee you, as everybody starts getting deformed, they're already kind of
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.760]  starting this.
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:37.640]  If you're against all the mutants, they're going to say you're racist.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.200]  And so it'll be, we're glad to be mutants.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.880]  Give us more mutations.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:45.640]  I guarantee you, see, they dump the chemicals in the water to confuse people's sexuality.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.520]  Then they have to create the schools and everything for everybody that doesn't know who they are.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.800]  And then they say, it's okay.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:54.560]  You're just being anti, you know, a hemaphrodite, because all these hemaphrodites are being
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:55.560]  born.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.560]  See how they do it?
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.560]  They really know what they're doing.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.560]  Well, we are literally creating an alien race.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:05.200]  It goes all the way from the animals to the foods to the humans.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.200]  That's right.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  And then the genetic engineering on top of it, and releasing the salmon that they admit
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.480]  it will extinct the other salmon that are part animal and part plant and part insect
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.360]  and four times larger.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.360]  And look, they're creating AI that's alien.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.360]  That's right.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:19.360]  This is an alien invasion.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.480]  I mean, you cannot, and I don't mean little green men folks, our elite, channeling the
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.920]  devil, other dimensional entities, whatever you want to call it.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.320]  I mean, really, this is what's happening.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.840]  They are literally playing God.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.840]  And we are totally screwed.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.360]  I mean, there's nothing stopping them.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.360]  They don't care.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.240]  They're clearly doing it on purpose.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.240]  What do you think about that statement?
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.640]  No, I think it's true.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.320]  They're probably going to come out with some or they probably already have something that
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.440]  you're going to have to pay millions of dollars for so you can actually repair the DNA in
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.440]  your body.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.440]  That's it.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.440]  And then go to them to have an embryo.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.440]  Exactly.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.360]  They'll say, well, we have laws now, so it's not aggressive or whatever.
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.960]  We're going to put our backdoors in there.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.640]  Or they're saying that your DNA is altered.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.720]  You're not even a human anymore.
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:04.680]  You've got a spokesman and then if we're against stopping the genetic mutations, again, we'll
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.680]  be racist.
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:09.600]  Yeah, you'll be in a FEMA camp and you'll be, you know, under control over there.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.800]  And, you know, at look, all this stuff, by the way, I believe I figured it out.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.160]  This is what they're doing.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.400]  All the food that's affected seems like a devil cult.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:20.200]  They say we're about to make the new God, the new computer.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.920]  We're about to make the new animal, the new human.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.920]  I don't believe in God yet, but I'm going to be God.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:24.920]  That's Ray Kurzweil.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.920]  I'm going to make aliens.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.920]  That's what he says.
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:27.920]  They're making aliens.
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.040]  Think of a science fiction book where the aliens don't come from space or an interdimensional.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.720]  We get so smart.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.200]  We make them ourselves.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:38.880]  It's like these radio telescopes blasting out all these star systems.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:39.880]  Please come here.
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.880]  We're here.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.880]  We're friendly.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]  Come.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]  You know, it's just crazy.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:44.880]  How do you do it?
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880]  You change the DNA.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.880]  You change the genes of the human.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.880]  How do you...
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.080]  Well, the Bible says a fallen alien from space is here manipulating world leaders to carry
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.880]  this out against God.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.880]  Now, that's what supposed 2 billion people are supposedly Christian on this planet.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.640]  Okay, so I'm asking folks, do you believe what God said or not?
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.560]  God created us in a certain way with a proper type of DNA.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.640]  He said do not mix the seed.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.640]  He...
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640]  Do not mix the seed.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:16.840]  And what we've had over the last 20 years is we've had the vaccine program, which alters
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.040]  DNA.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.520]  We've had stuff sprayed in the air, which alters DNA.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.160]  You have the tritium right now that's in the food and the air in the water that attacks
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:29.160]  the DNA with 18,000 electrovolts.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.160]  Fluoride.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.160]  Also is electrified.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.800]  You have fluoride, chlorine.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.920]  I mean, you have all of these things that are affecting the genetically modified foods.
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.720]  Look at the New York Times.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.560]  Scientists talk privately about creating a synthetic human genome, which means they've
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.560]  already done it.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.560]  Right.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.280]  You have DARPA and then you have IARPA too.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:51.240]  Most people don't even know about IARPA, which is the secret organization intelligence
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.200]  working on intelligence for the CIA.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.920]  DARPA is actually for the military.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:58.400]  IARPA is for the CIA, I mean...
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.800]  And let's go further.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:02.000]  They created Google.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  And let's expand.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  That's declassified.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.240]  And then let's expand on that.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.760]  They are now...
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.520]  Remember who created the Cold Springs Harbor Facility and the Genome Project?
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.840]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was its German counterpart.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.720]  It's a eugenics base on how to dumb us down and kill us.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.160]  It's a soft kill operation group.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.240]  There's no doubt now.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:23.240]  It's proven.
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:24.240]  What do we do?
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.280]  What do you do is what you do for anything that's attacking your body is you start detoxifying
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.280]  yourself.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:32.280]  You start detoxifying yourself.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.280]  Healing mechanism.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:34.280]  Stay there.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.280]  I want to explain how we help ourselves.
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.560]  But I want to talk about what do we do politically?
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.240]  Because I understand they're going to slowly turn up the titration of the poisoning to culturally
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:44.960]  prepare everybody for the mass die-off, so those of us that are cleansing will be better
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.280]  off than the final wipeout group, so we'll have a jump on the enemy.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.280]  But I mean, how do we stop them?
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:50.280]  Stay there.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.280]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.280]  We'll be right back with Dr. Group.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:59.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.280]  Thanks so much for being here with infowars.com.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.160]  I want to talk about something that really pisses me off.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.560]  The fact that we can live in a culture where people can identify as things other than what
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:08.760]  they actually are.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:13.240]  The fact that a man can identify as a woman and then go use that restroom.
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:18.120]  Or the fact that a white woman can identify as an African-American woman, let's call her
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.120]  Rachel Dolezal.
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:24.560]  I think at this point, then she should be able to get reparations for slavery or maybe
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:30.160]  a 18-year-old kid who plays Call of Duty all day and wants to identify as an elite special
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.160]  ops soldier.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:35.040]  I think if he carries out a really bad-ass mission on Call of Duty, Obama should have
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.560]  a ceremony and give that man the Medal of Honor.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:41.360]  Or perhaps you're lazy and you want to be trans-handicapped, that way you can park in
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.560]  all the good spots at the mall in a golden-crow buffet.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:50.760]  This is the matrix that we live in now in 2016, a world full of fairies, fake Asian tall
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.880]  people, men who are women, white women who are black.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.440]  This is the fall of the human species.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:25.760]  I'm Joe Bays with Infowars.com.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:52.440]  I'm Joe Bays with Infowars.com.
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:58.800]  Go to infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:31:59.800]  Hey, everyone.
[01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:03.560]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.840]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.960]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:12.720]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:18.200]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:21.480]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.040]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:27.320]  If you are dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:31.240]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.800]  nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.960]  the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:45.480]  it needs to do its healing work, you need to check out infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.320]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.800]  Head over to infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.720]  Your body will be very grateful.
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:33:20.440]  I'll see you in the next video.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:31.760]  Now, there's a multi-faceted fight to take on the globalist here, and what I set out
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:36.000]  to do for my family is do what I promote to others in a win-win, and then you purchasing
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.640]  the products that helps fund our organization to further warm people.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:43.280]  But we're going to briefly do some plugging here in association with all the toxins, the
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.720]  glyphosates, the GMOs, the radiation.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:49.480]  DNA Force, we're going to talk about what's in DNA Force from infowarsteam.com.
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.920]  It's nutraceutical, what it does to the inside of the cells to help detoxify them to the
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:55.920]  mitochondria.
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.760]  We're also going to talk about survival shield nascent iodine X2.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:05.480]  Now, it is certainly no panacea, folks, but drinking purified clean water, not living near
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:09.000]  reactors, being aware of what's going on.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.200]  This is key, but all of this just mitigates it.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:18.720]  Imagine the general public that is totally unaware watching TV all day on their smartphones.
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:24.040]  They are being devastated, and all the metric show, we're in trouble.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.280]  All metric show, our brain cells are dying.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:32.200]  We are 90% of, you know, in the west of the sperm are immobile.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:40.400]  We are falling apart, ladies and gentlemen, and it is just a completely evil plan, and
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.680]  our laziness and ignorance is what's letting it happen.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.680]  Here's the goodness.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:47.200]  I've said this thousands of times, I'll say it again, 30 years ago you couldn't find
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.760]  non-GMO, organic food anywhere.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:54.560]  People created a market, it became ubiquitous, it's now displacing the garbage food.
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.320]  10 years ago, you couldn't find plastic that didn't have bisphenol A. Now it's being phased
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:04.280]  out, and there are other problems, but when we move 7.5 billion of us, we have a lot of
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:05.280]  power.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:10.680]  All of the world, they're banning genetically modified crops that don't produce seeds or
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:12.920]  have their own pesticide in them.
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:20.160]  So we're in a genetic war, and a chemical war, a silent war of the 21st century.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.840]  You are in a war, that's what this is.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:28.960]  The final war to decide the future of humanity is a science war.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:34.040]  It's so epic, the stakes are so huge, but the average person is in a trance with football
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:39.160]  games and TV and movies and Captain America and all this fantasy land when reality is
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.160]  so incredible.
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.800]  I want to briefly get into stuff that we're not selling that helps people get detoxified,
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:50.560]  other ways you help try to stay away from this, but also high quality iodine, vitamin
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.000]  B12, secret 12, DNA force.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.520]  I was asking you, obviously I got into iodine because of Fukushima, but the other stuff
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:01.640]  out there was unbound, isn't as good as ours, but it certainly helped break down how people
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.640]  can protect themselves.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:09.840]  Well, first of all, no other doctor that I know of has identified all of the warfare
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:20.960]  measures that the globalists are using to demotivate us, to keep us sick, to induce disease.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:26.320]  So my approach was kind of different, let's identify all of those eugenics programs, let's
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:31.840]  identify all of the things and the attacks that we currently have against us through
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.240]  the air, the food and the water, and come up with countermeasures.
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.840]  And Alex, that's all we're doing is we're coming up with countermeasures to keep people
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.600]  healthy, such as the iodine.
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:47.160]  We know that the majority of the people on the planet are deficient in iodine.
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:53.280]  We see that iodine is essential for the endocrine system to function.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:37:01.240]  We have an overproduction and people are taking in way too much chlorine, fluoride, bromine,
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:02.760]  and toxic halogens.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:09.320]  We have thyroid issues, we have breast cancer, ovarian cysts, problems with sterility in
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.320]  men and women.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.680]  You know, that's a whole other subject that we're not talking about.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:21.200]  All of the supplements that we develop are designed as counter warfare measures to protect
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.440]  your body.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:26.320]  Everybody needs iodine with the amount of radiation in the air, all the health benefits
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:32.920]  of iodine that's out there, the survival shield X2 for purification of water, for your preparedness
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.440]  pack that you need.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.040]  It's on special right now.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.040]  You have it.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.240]  I don't think you've ever done 20% off on the X2 before.
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.880]  That is a great deal.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.200]  We use 99.999% pure iodine crystals.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.640]  I, you know, listen, talking about radiation and talking about chemicals and toxins, iodine
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.720]  has a long history.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:56.320]  It works as an anti-microbial agent and it helps bring all those chemicals and toxins
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.920]  out of your system, helps neutralize radiation.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.200]  Well, they're thinking of the stuff at Walgreens that'll eat your gut if you drink it.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.200]  How is this palatable?
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.200]  How does this work?
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:09.960]  So you definitely don't want to go to the drugstore and get iodine.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:14.280]  Iodine is actually a toxic compound in nature.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.880]  So what we have to do is we have a proprietary process that we developed where we detoxify
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:26.120]  the iodine, we turn it into a monoatomic element, a nason iodine, which it doesn't
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.760]  have to be broken down by the body.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.000]  It goes directly in your system and supports every single cell.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.240]  The beautiful thing about iodine is it's so hard to get away from some of these chemicals
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.440]  and toxins we're exposed to every single day.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:47.360]  But with iodine, it actually helps bring the fluoride, the chlorine, the bromine out
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.160]  of the thyroid gland.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.000]  It helps rebalance your endocrine system.
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.160]  That's another attack that we have.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:00.360]  So the attack on the endocrine system is through phthalates, through pesticides like glyphosate,
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.960]  through fluoride, chlorine, and bromine, just to name a few.
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:09.640]  So how do we counteract that attack is we take a good nascent form of iodine like the
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:12.720]  X2 on a daily basis or at least on a weekly basis.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:15.960]  And by the way, I would just add, filter your water, get a filter that really removes
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:16.960]  stuff.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:17.960]  I mean, there's so many things.
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.840]  Keep it out of your body to begin with, as you always say.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:20.840]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.400]  Use like the iodine to block it and pull it out of your body.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:26.880]  Now again, let's talk briefly about DNA force and then I want to get into Joe Jennings.
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:27.880]  I worked here for years.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.120]  He does a great job, worked in Florida and TV.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.120]  His dad just died.
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.360]  What was it a year, year and a half ago?
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.880]  I know you were distraught over it with a big brain tumor.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.440]  You grew up next to a nuclear power plant.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:42.920]  We're going to be talking about that in Tritium and this invisible killer that's everywhere.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:48.800]  But DNA force specifically, this is something we can actually make claims on because it's
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:55.720]  full of known, very expensive, but we discount them, nutraceuticals like bio, PQQ.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:02.720]  So the DNA force, again, you know, as we were talking with the attack on our DNA, I mean,
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.040]  how do we protect our DNA?
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.640]  That's really the whole purpose.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.720]  I mean, as we, as I was looking around at all these different things and your dad was
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:16.800]  actually helping me with this, he's like, we know that with the vaccines, especially
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.840]  with the vaccines, the flu shots, we know with what they're spraying in the air.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.240]  We know with all the radiation, we know there's an attack on our DNA.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.200]  How can we counter attack that?
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.160]  How can we protect our own DNA?
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:31.200]  How can we prevent actually the aging process or the degradation?
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.680]  Because what happens with DNA and with genetics is if your genes are malfunctioning or toxic
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:42.280]  and your DNA is toxic, the next time that cell replicates, it's going to malfunction.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:46.800]  And it just every time that cell replicates and replicates, if you're, if it doesn't
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:51.800]  have the proper nutrients and it's under attack by toxic substances, it's going to
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.000]  get worse and worse and worse and worse and it's going to be altering.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:02.440]  The good news is, and Bruce Lipton proved this, that the genes are directly related
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.400]  to the environment in which you live.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.320]  That means if you start putting clean water in your body, if you start eating clean, organic
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:14.480]  food, if you start reducing the amount of toxic genetic compounds that are coming into
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.560]  your body on a daily basis, then you can actually repair your genes and your DNA.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.520]  And bio-pickage was known, one of the only things to help the mitochondria that power
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:27.080]  the cells and it's full of a whole bunch of other stuff.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.720]  But this is admitted to regrow nerves.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:34.000]  I personally started taking it years ago and my finger that had been chopped off, the feeling
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  came back into it.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.760]  I mean, this is, this is serious.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:41.640]  So that's the whole purpose and that's why DNA force is so expensive because, but it's
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:42.640]  worth it.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:48.840]  It's, it actually works inside your body to help prepare for your cells and similar formulas
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.160]  though or double or triple the price.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:51.160]  We massively.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.160]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.960]  I mean, you just a single ingredients alone.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.760]  If you were to buy every single ingredient and DNA force by itself, it would be upwards
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:00.880]  of like three or $400 to do that.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:07.760]  So we, we have a unique combination of ingredients with the bio-pQQ, the trans resveratrol, the
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:16.560]  lipoic acid in there, all of the cellular components that are going to be there to help
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:22.720]  reduce the amount of toxic damage to your DNA and help your cells, yeah, it helps reduce
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.760]  all of the chemicals and toxins that are in there.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:29.640]  It protects the cell membrane by far one of the most successful products.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:33.000]  I take it every single day and I notice a difference.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.920]  Now, people got to watch out to folks that have had hurt backs and things.
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.800]  Sometimes nerves have basically gotten dead and things.
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:42.560]  I mean, you might talk to your physician to some people take it and they go, oh yeah,
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:43.560]  my nerves are coming back.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.960]  All right, my back's hurting.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.840]  And then a few months later, they're like, wow, the pain went away, but sometimes it
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.840]  doesn't.
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:49.840]  So talk to your physician.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:50.840]  This is, this is not a joke.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:51.840]  DNA force.
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:56.880]  That's just proof that that when you start having and you can feel things take place,
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:01.320]  even if you haven't felt an area, a lot of people say that they have numbness in different
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:05.960]  parts of their bodies from injuries and they start taking the DNA force and then they call
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:09.280]  into your customer service and they say, I'm starting to feel numbness or I'm starting
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:12.400]  to feel tingling sensation.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.400]  That's proof right there.
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:14.400]  That's nerve coming back.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:15.400]  It's totally numb.
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.840]  And then you can actually regenerate all of these things that my fingers started tingling
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.120]  for about four or five months and then just feelings back, tingling is gone.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:30.320]  Yep, all of the degenerative processes that are preplanned for population control eugenics
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.120]  to keep us sick, to keep us on medications.
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:36.960]  As a matter of fact, most pharmaceutical medications, practically all of them, cause genetic and
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.040]  DNA damage and cause damage to the cells.
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:46.720]  That's a whole nother show, but getting off and reducing your toxic amount coming into
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:52.800]  your body is obviously the first step, drinking a lot of good, clean, purified water.
[01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:55.160]  And not just being fatalistic and saying, oh, it's all over.
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.160]  Think about your children.
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.320]  Drink properly filtered water that actually doesn't just take out the taste, but screens
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.320]  it out.
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:06.240]  Take X2, take DNA force, but regardless, just take action and get healthy.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:07.440]  We're not preaching at you.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.800]  We don't want the globalists to be able to have their way.

[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:32.360]  Now, Dr. Grip, shifting out of that, other things that are out there that are natural,
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.960]  that are free, that also help briefly, and let's get to Joe Jennings' story.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:40.960]  He's got a lot of articles and documents about the fact that almost all reactors are leaking
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:45.480]  a bunch of different isotopes and tritium, and now they just say it's not bad for you.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.400]  Well, it's been around for a long time.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.400]  Tell us about your story.
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:55.240]  Basically, I mean, I grew up in Thousand Oaks, California, and that whole area, Thousand
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:02.200]  Oaks, Simi Valley, Kanoga Park, Northridge, that's a giant area.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:08.200]  It's north of LA, and I don't think anybody knew that there was a nuclear reactor there.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.920]  Or that one blew up there.
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:11.920]  No, no.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.000]  They kept it secret in the 50s when one blew up.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.880]  In 1959, it had a massive, it was an experimental reactor.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:25.960]  It had a massive overload, like Chernobyl, and what had happened is, the radioactive
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.480]  material had built up inside the reactor, so what did they have to do with it?
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.440]  Well, they said, vent it out the thing.
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  Vent it out the door.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.880]  Now, let me just stop and introduce Joe Jennings.
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:35.880]  Tell us who you are.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.960]  Tell us about your dad, because I know about this.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.440]  It's finally been in the news, but they've got experimental reactors, two of them here
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.920]  in Austin.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:47.000]  The word is, those have released stuff, but they just don't care.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.600]  Now they want to build another one, and then I tell people on the street, they laugh at
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.600]  me.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:55.080]  They're preconditioned, like some type of brainwashing, to not hear the truth, even
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.880]  when it's in front of them.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:02.400]  It's just so bizarre, but understand, this thing blew up, and they covered it up, and
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.720]  they've got one just like it here where we live.
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.400]  So break down your story and then get back into this.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.600]  So basically, me and my dad, growing up, he was a general contractor.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:19.480]  So what we basically did was, after high school and stuff, I'd go work with him, remodeling
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.480]  older homes.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:25.680]  Because most of the homes there were built in the 50s, in Southern California, old homes
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:26.680]  are known.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:32.240]  So what we would do is we would go in and remodel these homes, taking the exterior paint and
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.480]  sanding it back down to the wood because people were cheap and didn't want to buy new wood.
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:40.920]  So you're exposed to all these things, digging up their yards, doing all these different
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.600]  things.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:51.080]  At no point did me or my dad know that, hey, there's toxic stuff in the woods, in the groundwater,
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.360]  in the soils, anything like that.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:55.800]  Nobody knows about this.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:03.880]  So basically, about a year and a half ago, my dad died just very suddenly, had a glioblastoma
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:05.440]  brain tumor.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:12.920]  Now nobody in our family's had history of brain tumors or any kind of cancer like that.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:16.080]  And it was kind of like a puzzle piece going, well, how did this happen?
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.080]  Where did this come from?
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:22.560]  I mean, how do you get a brain tumor just out of nowhere?
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.520]  How do we have 10,000% increase in conservatively and pediatric cancers?
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:27.520]  Exactly.
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.520]  We're getting killed.
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:29.520]  Go ahead, please.
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:37.320]  As someone who's lost a very close family member, you always have that question of why, how
[01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:38.520]  could this happen?
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:39.520]  Where did it happen?
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.120]  Had my affected by what happened?
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:45.760]  Was I been put into that situation also?
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:52.080]  So I did see this story that NBC4 came out with, and it just blew my mind.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:59.080]  It's like a giant puzzle piece that just falls into your lap and you go, oh, wait a minute.
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:05.020]  This is the exact areas that we worked in, that we remodeled in, plus my dad did a lot
[01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:06.020]  of work.
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.840]  And by the way, this was Chernobyl level.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:08.840]  It blew up.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:09.840]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.320]  So know this, when they blow up, they cover it up, folks.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.320]  Yeah.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.320]  They covered up the whole thing.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:15.320]  Nobody knew about it.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.080]  They were sworn to secrecy.
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:24.720]  So after the Northridge earthquake hit, and I think what, 90 or 91, we did a massive amount
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.400]  of remodeling in those areas.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.480]  Now what happens when the earth shakes?
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.480]  It brings up soils.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:37.040]  It brings up all kinds of things that weren't there before.
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.160]  At no point did anyone, and there was thousands and thousands of contractors working on these
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.160]  older homes.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.720]  Just like the dust on 9-11, that they knew it was deadly.
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.320]  They lied and said it wasn't because they want to kill us.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.320]  Yeah.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:51.520]  They don't want to reveal it.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:54.880]  Could you imagine if they had to pay people for that?
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.960]  And one of the scary things is, you know, we all knew that Rocketdyne was up in the hills
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.880]  in San Jacinto Pass.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.360]  They tested shuttle engines.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.880]  They tested most of the rockets that went into space.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:08.480]  That's where they tested them every day.
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:09.720]  You felt the ground shaking.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720]  Guess what?
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720]  They're testing a rocket.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:16.760]  All of those plumes, all that stuff is just going right into the air, right there in
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:21.080]  Seamy Valley, which is named the Valley of the Wind.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:25.600]  Now, right next to Seamy Valley is where we get a lot of our produce.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:32.520]  Strawberries, melons, avocados, oranges, it's all in that valley.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.800]  And where does the wind go?
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:39.800]  It goes right into the valley, and the other side of the valley, towards all these high-priced
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:40.800]  homes.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.800]  And guess what?
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:42.800]  Radiation doesn't care.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:50.200]  And just remember, folks, they've got hundreds of research reactors around the country, and
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.720]  the public doesn't even know about them.
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:53.720]  We never knew about it.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.200]  I didn't know there was a reactor up there.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:56.200]  There was more than one.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.200]  There was four.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.200]  Experimental reactor.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.080]  We were talking about there where you grew up in California.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.080]  Yeah.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.080]  In the San Azuzana Pass.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:05.080]  Now, we knew Rocketdyne was there.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:06.920]  We knew they tested rocket engines there.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:07.920]  But I don't...
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.920]  Nobody...
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:09.920]  By the way, people say, oh, experimental.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:10.920]  It's not big.
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:11.920]  No.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.920]  Some numbers, huge.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:13.920]  They're more dangerous because they're turning them on.
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:14.920]  They're turning them off.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.920]  They're doing...
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:18.080]  They're simulating disasters with these stinking things.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.080]  They don't have all the safety equipment that they've ordered.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:25.480]  It tells you that when you go to school at UT, under UT downtown, is a humongous experimental
[01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:26.480]  reactor.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:28.080]  They don't tell anybody.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.080]  No.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.080]  Mm-mm.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.080]  They said that they were...
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:34.920]  The waste that was produced by the reactor, they take it out to what they call the burn
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:39.200]  pit and shoot it with a high-powered rifle and explode it.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.200]  Yeah.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.200]  That's what they do here at Austin.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:46.200]  They just take it out up north and they just throw it in a cave.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.200]  Nice people.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:50.720]  They just sit there for millions and millions of years and contaminates the earth and contaminates
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.400]  the environment in the air, so...
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:53.600]  Who are these people?
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.600]  Are they people?
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:55.600]  Are they demon-possessed?
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.600]  We'll be back.

[01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:16.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was just given an article that went live on infowars.com that was devastating.
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:20.320]  You see all the German Green Party and all the main Muslim leaders saying, blonde-haired
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.320]  blue eyes bad.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:23.480]  We will get rid of the blonde-haired blue eyes.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.480]  They are bad.
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:25.480]  We will get rid of the Christians.
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.480]  They are bad.
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.920]  The Pope has now come out and said Christians are bad.
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.960]  I link through.
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:31.960]  It's official.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:32.960]  He did it.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:34.400]  It's a speech.
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.840]  You cannot make this up.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:43.040]  Pope Francis likens Jesus to ISIS says Muslims, migrants must breathe with Europeans.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:49.920]  Francis claims ISIS similar to Jesus sending his disciples to all nations.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:52.760]  This guy is a false prophet for sure now.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:59.200]  He goes on to say, the Pope said he quote dreaded, this is a quote, hearing about Christian
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.720]  roots of Europe.
[01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:07.120]  I'm quoting the Pope, the false Pope dreaded hearing about Christian roots in Europe because
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:14.480]  to him they take a colonialist overtones and he claimed on Europe nations to integrate,
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.960]  called on them Muslim migrants into the continent and to breathe with them.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:21.960]  This guy is incredible.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.360]  Your take on that.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:32.640]  That's, I mean, it just every single day something comes out that is so shocking that it's almost
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:33.640]  unbelievable.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.920]  We're in these times right now, which don't get me wrong, these times are good because
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:45.040]  we are creating a lot of change, but they're also, it's like a war that's happening between
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.200]  the globalists and the people.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.120]  And the enemy is just uncloaking.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:52.080]  And they're just coming out and doing anything and saying any single thing that they want.
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:53.080]  Absolutely.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:57.440]  Stuff that you would never imagine a Pope saying in the history.
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:02.640]  These times are going to be looked back upon like our kids and they're going to say, wow,
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:06.760]  man, you lived in those times and we're going to say, look at this, yes, we were part of
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:08.160]  the revolution.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:09.160]  Or if they win.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:10.160]  Who knows?
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.000]  Oh, Francis, like Jesus, ISIS, you can actually read this.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.560]  He told the French newspaper in an interview.
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:20.280]  I mean, let's get back to the radiation.
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.400]  You were talking about we doctors aren't trained to look for the poisoning, plus a lot of these
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:28.440]  eyes to sit in your body for years, then they give you the tumors, but it's basically dissipated
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:29.440]  once you die.
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:30.440]  Break it down.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:38.840]  Every every radio radiological damaging element, whether it's plutonium, uranium, cesium, they
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:40.600]  all have different half-lifes.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.160]  Tritium has a half-life of 12 years.
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:49.520]  So what happens is you might have, I mean, right now with Fukushima alone, all of the
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:54.640]  damage, nothing is being documented because they don't want to document it.
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:57:02.000]  They don't want to come out publicly and say, this is the damage worldwide from Fukushima.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:08.280]  You have earthquakes that are at record levels right now happening like 300 earthquakes or
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:10.640]  more a day happening around the world.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.760]  Yellowstone is is being destroyed before recorded stuff.
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:18.640]  We are on the verge of a major nuclear disaster.
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:19.640]  All it takes.
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:25.920]  These nuclear power plants, whoever designed them, putting them right next to the ocean
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:31.560]  or putting them right next to major riverways, I mean, it was almost like they were designed
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:32.640]  that way on purpose.
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:37.560]  They almost knew that say 60 years from now, we're going to have a major nuclear disaster
[01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:39.560]  because of all the earthquakes and all the changes.
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:41.240]  Well, I was talking to a scientist.
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:46.040]  I mean, the best reason for it is rivers are usually on fault lines that have broken open
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.040]  to the water flows.
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.040]  That's what really cuts to the canyon.
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:50.200]  It's an earthquake water didn't do most of that.
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:54.800]  And so they build them on fault lines because that's where the rivers and lakes and oceans
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:55.800]  are.
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:58.600]  But but still they're now on fault lines, which shows they don't even care.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.640]  And Joe Gennies, you're making a point about your dad, there he was with that brain tumor
[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:03.560]  that grew so fast to kill him in a few weeks.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:04.880]  They gave him more radiation.
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:05.880]  Yeah.
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:06.880]  They said, well, what's it?
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.640]  Well, how do how do we deal with this?
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:09.880]  Well, radiation.
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:13.800]  Well, what do you mean that the man can barely stand now?
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.640]  So you're going to give him more radiation?
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:16.640]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:19.160]  Kill him in three months.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:22.880]  Radiation kills rapidly transforming cells.
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:27.280]  It kills all the cells in your body until the cells adapt and learn how to grow even
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:28.280]  faster.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:29.280]  That's the cancer cause.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:30.280]  Right.
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:33.280]  That's where you get your two heads or all the truth is they think out of all these mutations
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.320]  they're causing, the superhuman's going to rise out of it because that science they're
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:41.480]  testing on a mass guinea pig, the whole planet's a giant, the whole planet's a giant guinea
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:47.440]  pig to give birth to Satanic engineered species.
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:48.440]  That's their own dream.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:49.440]  Ray Kerr as well.
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.440]  We'll look back.
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:53.960]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:58.960]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:01.480]  organize and prepare a defense.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:07.920]  60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:13.520]  of their own, air raid sirens, but in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:19.200]  quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:24.440]  our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:28.040]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:35.880]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:39.160]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:42.080]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:46.960]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:51.520]  with Anthroplex.
[01:59:51.520 --> 02:00:19.680]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run.
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:37.720]  All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, Joe Jennings, talking about your personal
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:43.760]  experiences living next door to a secret nuke dump site that exploded as big or bigger than
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:44.760]  Chernobyl.
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:48.760]  I mean, people criticized the Russian response, at least they told people and said in suicide
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:51.000]  teams to actually try to stop it.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.920]  Not here, we just covered it up.
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:56.000]  They just really, you know, in Chernobyl, they removed the people, they said, everybody
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000]  get out.
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:02.920]  California, oh, there's too many people who can't do that, don't tell them, that was
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:03.920]  the cover.
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:06.760]  They admit Chernobyl has killed over a million people from cancer alone.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:07.760]  Oh, sure.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.880]  I mean, they've done studies that even the microbes that are in the forests of Chernobyl
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:15.360]  nowadays can't break down anything.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.560]  Back in the leaves fall and they rotten, nothing's rotting.
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:26.800]  It's all still there because the new, the radiation has killed absolutely everything
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:28.880]  as far as the circle of life.
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:32.360]  And we wonder why our kids, people's kids out there look like mutants, people say, why
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:37.640]  do your kids not look like mutants, no vaccines, non-GMO food, packing them full of DNA force,
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:38.880]  and people make fun of me.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:46.440]  They had MSNBC and CNN last week made fun of Roger Stone, unsolicited, plugged brain
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:47.440]  force.
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:51.000]  I mean, that's a known new tropic with a lot of high quality things that boost the brain,
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.400]  but coffees, you could say is a new tropic, kind of a low grade one, you know, and they're
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:57.040]  making fun of us selling pills that boost people's brains.
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:01:59.080]  The military gives people speed, folks.
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.560]  We sell high quality, natural stuff that doesn't hurt you.
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:04.600]  But again, they make a joke about science, Dr. Group, what else can we do to protect
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:05.600]  ourselves?
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.940]  Well, what you can do, first of all, what I would recommend is everybody check and see
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:16.800]  if they live within a 200 mile radius of any type of experimental or nuclear reactor.
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:21.960]  If you do, really, believe it or not, one of the best things to do is just drink a lot
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:24.000]  of clean water.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.840]  The problem with most people is that their elimination routes are blocked.
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:31.880]  They're not having two bowel movements a day because they're eating a bunch of garbage
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:35.560]  food and their digestive system is not functioning correctly.
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:38.800]  They have two Hillary's a day.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:44.040]  They're not drinking enough water, clean water, which means they're not urinating enough.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:49.040]  See, we have natural methods to repair our genes and repair our DNA.
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:53.120]  If our elimination routes are functioning properly, we've got to turn it over.
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.200]  We've got to women also have another way.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:56.200]  There were menses.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:57.200]  Exactly.
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:03.280]  There are four ways through defecation, urination, diaphoresis, sweating, and respiration, and
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:05.640]  then women have the menstrual cycles.
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:10.520]  If those elimination routes are functioning properly, a lot of times water will remove
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:14.880]  some of these radioactive particles from the body.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:18.840]  Exercise, water, eating clean food, drink no more.
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:20.360]  This is so extreme.
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:25.240]  Eat clean food, water, exercise, walk in the woods, pray to God, meditation, CBS News,
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.160]  it makes you live like a decade longer.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.160]  You always say that.
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:29.160]  Absolutely.
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:31.840]  So evil, high quality vitamins and minerals, you're a horrible person.
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:32.840]  Yeah, the solution is here.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:34.840]  And don't live near a nuke site that blew up.
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.880]  Oh, but they didn't tell Joe Jennings and 10 million other people.
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:45.240]  You pretty much have to these days be on iodine, be on good nutritional supplements.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:48.840]  I would recommend everybody being on the DNA force.
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.480]  You were exposed to this show in closing.
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.840]  What did you do to protect yourself?
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:54.480]  I'm taking the iodine.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:59.640]  I drink a ton of water, exercise, I just, anything I can do now.
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:03.200]  I mean, I just, yeah, you lost quite a bit of weight since your dad done.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.200]  Yeah.
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:09.880]  I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's that, that you never know, you know, you're never
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:10.880]  going to die, right?
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:11.880]  You know, in your mind.
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.880]  Oh, I'm never going to die.
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:17.960]  But when you see somebody close like that, who just all of a sudden, boom, you're dead.
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:21.120]  You start thinking, wait a minute, what do I need to do?
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:22.560]  Oh, my mom died like that.
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:23.560]  Boom.
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:24.560]  She was in great shape.
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:25.560]  Boom.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:26.560]  Dead.
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:27.560]  My dad too.
[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:30.760]  I died in two weeks, but he was exposed to all the phthalates and he was in Exxon working
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:31.760]  with PVC.
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:32.760]  He's one of the inventors of this female.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:33.760]  Yeah, he was.
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:34.760]  Yes.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:35.760]  He literally had the men in black come to your house after he died.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:36.760]  Yes, I did.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.760]  Yep.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:40.720]  Had him come to my house and pretty much forced my mom to sign this thick a document saying
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:44.880]  they weren't going to release any type of, or she wasn't going to sue.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:45.880]  You know what?
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:46.880]  Those men in black, they're not immune either.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:50.240]  Why are, as a species, let's stop lying to ourselves and let's start cleaning this
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:51.240]  up.
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.240]  Oh, I forgot.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.240]  Only carbon.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:54.920]  You know, that will be saved.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:56.480]  They just want to tax carbon.
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:57.480]  Great job.
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:04:58.480]  You're on the mountain news tonight with Jakari.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:04:59.480]  God bless you both.
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:03.440]  Black Iowa student starts fight, loses, makes a paint crime, gets caught, and was claimed
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:05.160]  on the night of April 30th.
[02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:10.200]  He was attacked by three evil white college age men who beat him bloody while screaming
[02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:11.700]  racial swirrs.
[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:15.920]  Activist students claim the attacks showed a climate of racial hatred in Iowa City,
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:20.480]  and they also denounced the university for taking until May 4th to issue a statement
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:21.800]  about the matter.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:27.360]  How many black students must be a victim of hate crime before an alert is sent out once
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:31.080]  student complain on line at the time?
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:35.720]  But footage, which was released by police, shows a very different series of events.
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:39.560]  The footage shows Owens entered the bar close to midnight, and then getting involved in
[02:05:39.560 --> 02:05:44.120]  a massive bar, mainly around 1.35 a.m., he was kicked out of the bar, and then proceeded
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:48.640]  to get in two additional fights within the next 10 minutes, and all of the fights Owens
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:53.000]  is acting aggressively and throwing punches, and police say he appears to have been the
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.200]  instigator in at least a few of the fights.
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:58.240]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:02.840]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and

[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:53.200]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Young Jebedee and the products
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.920]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.720]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:03.120]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:07.640]  called the iodine conspiracy, and told you about how scientists have known for decades
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:12.560]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government, knowingly, started
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:17.160]  taking iodine out of the food, and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:18.160]  into the water.
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:21.880]  They took the good halogen-O, and put the deadly halogen-M.
[02:07:21.880 --> 02:07:26.400]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.840]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:34.320]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:40.080]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:41.680]  ever concerning iodine.
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:43.640]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:47.880]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:49.920]  any optimum health regimen.

[01:51:32.860 --> 02:08:43.440]  from the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:49.120]  Anyone wondering why Bernie Sanders' socialist battle cry turned the stomach of many Americans
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:52.960]  need only look at what is happening in Latin America right now.
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:58.360]  Reuters reports Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro declared a 60-day state of emergency
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:23.000]  on Friday due to what he calls plots from within the OPEC country and the United States to topple
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  his leftist government.
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.200]  With the details of the measure, a previous state of emergency implemented in states near
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:34.440]  the Columbia border last year suspended constitutional guarantees in those areas except for guarantees
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:36.360]  relating to human rights.
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:42.000]  Maduro is panicking after his socialist ally Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was forced
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.480]  to step down in what she is calling a coup d'etat.
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:50.680]  It appears Obama is forcing his hand into yet another blatant example of his long list
[02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:54.480]  of corpocratic imperialism for the benefit of the New World Order.
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:10:01.240]  In 2002, Obama failed to overthrow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as Washington Post Scott
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:06.560]  Wilson, the paper's Latin America, corresponded at the time reported the United States was
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:09.520]  hosting people involved in the coup before it happened.
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:13.800]  There was involvement of U.S. sponsored NGOs and training people that were involved in
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:14.800]  the coup.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:17.280]  I think there was U.S. involvement, yes.
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:22.560]  Maduro has every reason to believe the United States is fomenting his demise.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.000]  Venezuela is sitting on the largest oil reserves in the world.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.160]  However, the Venezuelan people are starving as Zero Hedge reports.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:35.960]  Hungry Venezuelans are protesting that their children are dying from lack of food and medicine
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:39.160]  and that they do not have enough water or electricity.
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:44.080]  As against crony capitalism added, this is a country with more oil than Saudi Arabia
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:48.680]  and the government has stolen all the money and now they bottleneck peaceful protesters
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:52.800]  and threaten them with bombs or haul them to prison and torture them.
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:56.600]  As pure desperation is set in, crime has become inevitable.
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:01.320]  A man accused of mugging people in the streets of Caracas was surrounded by a mob of onlookers
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:03.360]  beaten and set on fire.
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.920]  Mob justice is now the supreme arbiter of who lives and who dies.
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:12.200]  In the coming weeks, Obama will likely install yet another dictator friendly to the United
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.920]  States as he just did in Brazil.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:20.280]  Kurt Nemo writes the Rothschild owned magazine The Economist describes Michael Temmer as Brazil's
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.000]  unplanned president.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.720]  The 75-year-old law professor who played a key role in the impeachment of President Dilma
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:31.960]  Rousseff became the South American country's acting president on Thursday after Rousseff
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:35.080]  was suspended by the Senate on corruption charges.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:39.200]  Temmer's rise to power, however, is not merely a happenstance event.
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.440]  It was arranged by the U.S. State Department in much the same way the puppet government
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:45.520]  was put into place in the Ukraine.
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:50.600]  On Friday, the whistleblower website WikiLeaks released an unclassified yet sensitive cable
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:55.320]  revealing Temmer acted as an embassy informant for U.S. intelligence and the military.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:58.400]  Maduro had supported Obama's approach towards Cuba.
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:02.640]  However, as the long list of fallen leaders have come to understand with either their
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:08.400]  own deaths, invasion, or incarceration, the tidal wave of the global recession has benefited
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:14.600]  Obama, offering him many disguises, but only serves one master's instructions.
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:19.240]  That of the New World Order, John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:24.080]  Victor Ostrowski is an amazing bestselling author, artist, researcher, former high-level
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:25.080]  Mossad officer.
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:28.040]  He's been on everything from Larry King Live to ABC Nightly News, CBS.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:31.200]  I'm not going to get into it, but he's a famous spy.
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:38.080]  He's also was banned for one week, but was overturned by the appeals court in Israel.
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:43.880]  That was the book by way of deception, and I'm not going to, I mean, I got him as gone
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:44.880]  for five hours.
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:47.720]  He's only on for about 20 minutes today, and I want to invite him back in the next few
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:52.200]  weeks or months when he can for a full hour to get into just his amazing history and the
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.120]  way he sees the world.
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.880]  His website is thebookpatch.com.
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:00.520]  The reason I thought of him when I'm getting back on was he's the only publisher out there
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:06.800]  that would put out Cochita Sarnoff's incredible investigative journal report, Trafficking,
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.760]  that deals with the white slavery going on around the world and how that ties into Bill
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:13.040]  Clinton and the election and all the rest of it.
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:14.040]  So he's a really interesting fellow.
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:19.200]  So I wanted him to just pop in on human trafficking, but also other things happening in the world
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:22.000]  and his general view on where the world is today.
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.880]  So Victor, it's always great to have you on with us.
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:24.880]  It's been many years.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:25.880]  Thank you.
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:27.480]  Thank you very much for having me.
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:28.960]  Well, where should we start?
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:31.080]  I kind of threw out a few topics there.
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.600]  I'll do make a correction that it was the Israeli government that stopped the publication
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:41.960]  of the book in the, of my book in the U.S. at the time by going to court and asking for
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:42.960]  it.
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:48.240]  They said it to endangers people and or countries, which then was overturned based on freedom
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.240]  of speech.
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:50.240]  Sure.
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:52.480]  I was just reading the online bio, but specifically they tried to stop your book.
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:53.480]  Yeah.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:54.480]  Yeah.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:55.480]  It's not, you weren't incorrect.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:56.480]  All right.
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:59.160]  So, I mean, thank you for publishing this book.
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:00.160]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:04.320]  You know, the research meshes for their own research, but I mean, the bigger picture in
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.320]  your research into human trafficking.
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:14.440]  Well, the whole point was not necessarily what I know, but the whole idea of not stopping
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:23.040]  a book from publication by self-censorship of publishers because they were afraid of
[02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:25.360]  lawsuits, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:30.800]  So, you know, that's a new method of censorship.
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:36.560]  If you look at it, it is a bombshell book and there are explosive elements in it.
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:40.000]  And yet the mainstream media is not touching it.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:46.120]  It was actually mentioned today or yesterday on Fox News that, you know, for some reason,
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:52.720]  you know, nobody is doing it, which is amazing to me.
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:54.360]  There's a lot of research that went to it.
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:55.680]  It's all documented.
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.080]  All the paperwork is in the book.
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:00.680]  Conchita wrote a really long research on it.
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:09.400]  She took her six years to write it and it's very detailed and, you know, the book trafficking
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:12.120]  is absolutely amazing.
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:20.040]  It's a, you know, I come from a world that is quite scary, but relative to what I went
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:23.920]  through, what these people are going through is unbelievable.
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:26.920]  And it reads like a spy novel.
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:30.120]  In fact, she was placed in danger when she was in Mexico.
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.280]  She had to basically run away.
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:37.000]  There's a lot of powerful people involved and it's very easy for them to manipulate
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  things and just to keep it out, you know, just to keep it out of the mainstream media,
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.400]  which basically makes it almost disappear.
[02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:54.600]  And that's my main goal with a book patch, you know, to allow people to publish books
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:59.720]  and to come to the forefront with stories that otherwise you may not hear, just like
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:00.720]  your show.
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:03.520]  Well, I remember many years ago having you on.
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:08.120]  I mean, I guess we call you a whistleblower exposing corruption in Israel as being your
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:09.120]  anti-Israel.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:11.960]  They try to spin it like that, but you're exposing corruption.
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:14.920]  And of course, I'm no enemy of Israel, but whenever I do criticize some of the Israeli,
[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:18.480]  you know, government actions that are different groups of people, then I get demonized, you
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:20.920]  know, as, you know, being anti-Israel.
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:24.520]  But on the other side of the coin, because I'm not completely anti-Israel, people say
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:26.080]  I mean, it must work for Israel.
[02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:32.640]  But it's really frustrating, you know, looking back to your books and things you exposed
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:37.600]  and some of the Israeli government trying to block you, is Israel more corrupt or less
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:38.600]  corrupt today?
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:39.600]  Or is that an oversimplification?
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:43.600]  It seems like all these governments now are just more and more out of control.
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:51.680]  But there is, it's very hard to say, but from my experience, I can just tell you this.
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:56.360]  I did not go against Israel, although I, you know, you get labeled right away and it's
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:01.160]  very easy to be smeared, you know, and said, well, you're anti-Israel, which is kind of
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:08.720]  almost like a mantra of anybody that disagrees with policies which are wrong.
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:15.560]  And I think friends of Israel, if you're drunk and your friends don't tell you you're drunk
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:21.760]  and just let it go and let you drive, they're not your friends.
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:28.160]  So criticizing a policy which is wrong gives you credibility when you agree with policies
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:31.320]  that are right.
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:36.280]  And I think that's how media should be working and not just being afraid of being smeared
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:42.240]  and feathered as anti-Israel, which is a tactic.
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:44.320]  Every government should be criticized.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:47.120]  Every government has corruption.
[02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:49.840]  It's not something that will be stopped in a minute.
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:57.200]  But if people are silenced and don't speak up, they take their partners, actually, in
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:17:59.440]  all the things that are wrong.
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:04.880]  And I criticized an agency that was completely out of control, the head of the agency, which
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:09.520]  is called Mossad, which is Israel's CIA, was an unknown person.
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:13.000]  It was like a secret of who he was.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.440]  After that came changes.
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:21.880]  Now the person who was head of the agency is, in fact, a known person.
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:25.200]  So he can be criticized in public.
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:28.600]  And agencies like that don't like their laundry wash.
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:32.560]  So really, you could be called a major reformer.
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:37.520]  Well, I'll let other people call me that.
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:40.560]  I don't want to boast myself.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:43.160]  They said that I endangered people and or countries.
[02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:46.200]  I find that ludicrous.
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:49.880]  One of the funny things is one of the people that was mentioned in my book just by his
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:50.880]  first name.
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:56.000]  I didn't mention names of agents or anything like that, not to endanger people.
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.200]  And by way of deception, which is actually the motto of the Mossad, which is, by way
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:03.120]  of deception, thou shalt do war.
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:04.800]  He was, his name was Yossi.
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:07.960]  Today he is the head of Mossad.
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:12.760]  So really, I didn't appear that I even ruined anybody's career.
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:15.840]  And he's mentioned several times in my book.
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:18.720]  Well, I know this.
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:22.360]  These intelligence agencies are basically all linking up together in the West to take
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:26.640]  our basic liberties and saying it's going to keep us safe, but we never get safer.
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:27.640]  It's just crazy.
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:31.360]  I want to get back into the short segment we have about other big topics you're looking
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:36.600]  at, other things you're concerned about in the world today with our guest, Vistor Osroski.
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:40.760]  The website is thebookpatch.com and he's published Traffa King.
[02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:50.040]  It's T-R-A-F-F-I capital K-I-N-G, Traffa King, and it's powerful information folks to understand
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:53.960]  the type of weird organized crime groups that infest government corporations, intelligence
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:58.040]  agencies, and are all around us and have to be dealt with with sunshine.
[02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:03.040]  Stay with us.
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:07.440]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:10.440]  to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:14.160]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:18.400]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:19.880]  I said, let me see.
[02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:24.720]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly rated price competitive
[02:20:24.720 --> 02:20:29.880]  companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what
[02:20:29.880 --> 02:20:31.440]  he had been quoted.
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:36.680]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience,
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:43.480]  and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:44.480]  How about you?

[02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:04.840]  Victor Ostrovsky is our guest for five, six more minutes then.
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:10.880]  Roger Stone, the Trump insider that the New York Times is admitting is basically they
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:12.800]  think is Trump's brain.
[02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:14.680]  No, he's not Trump's brain.
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:15.680]  Trump is his own brain.
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:19.000]  But we're going to be getting into the whole campaign, the latest on that coming up in
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  a minute.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.200]  Victor, I want to get you back up sometime just because I remember that interview, you
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:25.640]  must have been 10 years ago about your book by way of deception that I know is the best
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:30.360]  seller, and on a lot of the stuff in the book I knew, but a lot of it I didn't know, pretty
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:31.360]  amazing stuff.
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.920]  I want to get you back to talk about that, but since then, what other interesting stuff
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:35.920]  has happened?
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:40.360]  What's most important for a former insider to impart to the audience here today?
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:49.080]  Well, I think the perception that we have about the war against terrorism, there's one
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:51.720]  point that I think is important to remember.
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:55.360]  There's basically two types of terrorist organizations.
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:04.520]  One is territorial, like the PLO used to be, the PFLPGC, the Hezbollah, the Hamas, and
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:06.360]  the Basques.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:15.080]  On the other hand, there's usually ideological terrorists, which are like the Red Army brigades,
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:21.480]  Butterminov, and you would call El Qaeda, it would be one of them as well.
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:28.000]  The new thing that we're finding is this ISIS or ISIL or a Daesh, call it what you want.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000]  That's a combination.
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  That's something new.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  I would call it a conquest group, isn't it?
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.120]  I mean, they want territory, but they also want to take over.
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.840]  Yeah, they have an ideology, so they're on the one hand, they're ideological.
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:43.600]  On the other hand, they're also to cover territory, so they're territorial.
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:49.360]  So that's a new brand, and that attracts a lot of people.
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:57.040]  And the main danger of it is that there's no way that we know how to fight them.
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:01.880]  You take away their territory, they attack it a new place.
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:08.320]  There has to be a more concerted effort to bring the world together in order to fight
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:11.440]  them, because this is a global problem.
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:15.560]  They'll blow something up in Belgium, and the next day it'll be in the US.
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:21.720]  They have no limitations, they don't play by the rules, and the one of the major things
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:27.400]  is in order to keep coalitions together, the people who fight against them have to keep
[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:30.800]  by the rules and not be dragged into, you know-
[02:26:30.800 --> 02:26:33.280]  Sure, don't get lower to their level of torture and all the rest of it.
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:36.960]  I mean, aren't they really belligerent because they're backed in part by the Wahhabist in
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:37.960]  Saudi Arabia?
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:41.360]  I mean, isn't this kind of a proxy army?
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:48.240]  It's very hard to say, because just like any other government or country, Saudi Arabia
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:54.400]  especially is not a democracy, but I have fractions within them.
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:56.880]  Some support, some don't.
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:03.840]  There's a lot of money involved in the ability to support that, but really if they stop support,
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:09.200]  a lot of times they support out of fear, because if they stop their support, that snake will
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.680]  turn on them.
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:12.680]  And they're-
[02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:14.360]  Again, so it's keep your enemies close.
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:16.120]  I beg your pardon?
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:18.040]  Keep your enemies close.
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:20.840]  Keep your enemies close, yes.
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.640]  Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
[02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:34.920]  But that's one problem, but the other problem is that there's really no real policy in foreign
[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:41.440]  affairs that deals with it and has a guideline, you know, leading from behind on this aspect,
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:49.600]  you know, basically I lean towards the left, but on this thing, you can't lead from behind.
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:52.840]  You know, the world looks to the U.S. to lead them.
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:53.840]  Sure.
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:56.680]  Don't you just- I don't like torture people's families, not with me for that, I mean it's
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:00.440]  torture, but what about prosecuting their families when their families can be proven
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:01.440]  to be aiding and abetting them?
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:04.240]  I mean, I never see their families getting in trouble when they're in England or France
[02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:05.240]  or whatever.
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:09.320]  They're going off to kill Christians and people in- and you know, non-Mohabbiists in
[02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:10.320]  Syria or Libya.
[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:12.520]  I mean, how about their families get arrested?
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:18.320]  Well, the problem here with that is that there's proof that it doesn't work.
[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:20.640]  Israel has been doing this for years.
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:26.480]  They catch a terrorist, you know, they prove his guilt, they'll go and they'll demolish
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:30.680]  the family's house, which they lived in for generations.
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:31.680]  That just makes more terrorists.
[02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:32.680]  Yeah.
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:36.400]  So what do you do in 70 seconds, I'm going to have you back sir, I appreciate your time,
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:37.400]  thebookpatch.com.
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:41.080]  I mean, you're an expert, what do we do then?
[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:44.920]  Well, you deal with it by the laws that you have.
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:49.960]  You don't give up freedoms, you don't give up freedom of speech, you don't curtail, you
[02:28:49.960 --> 02:28:53.040]  know, the ability to express yourself.
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:54.280]  You stay the line.
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:56.640]  I mean, that's the whole secret of success-
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:02.880]  Moral high ground, moral high ground, moral high ground.
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:05.880]  Yeah, you take the moral high ground, but you fight.
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:10.560]  I mean, you don't stay out of the fight, but you fight it in according to the rules and
[02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:13.040]  regulations that you want to be treated.
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:17.840]  And if the other side doesn't treat you that way, that doesn't mean you take them and you
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:19.040]  treat them differently.
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:24.520]  You just, you just go and you look for new ways, new imaginative ways.
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:28.720]  Do you think ISIS is stronger now or weaker than it was two years ago?
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:30.520]  I'm sorry.
[02:29:30.520 --> 02:29:34.800]  Do you think ISIS is stronger or weaker now?
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:39.200]  On the one hand, it's weaker because of lack of territory, that they got less territory,
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:44.000]  but every time they lose a soldier or they lose a combatant, they gain two or three.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.520]  They want to take its place because they're promised to the people that they're giving
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:50.520]  room in their, in their group.
[02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:51.520]  I understand.
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:52.520]  We'll have you back.
[02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:53.520]  Victor, thank you.
[02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:54.520]  You're welcome.
[02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:55.520]  Please, we got Roger Stone coming up.
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:56.520]  I'm not gonna stay with us.
[02:29:56.520 --> 02:30:05.480]  A white person smiling at a black person is a racist microaggression.
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:08.200]  Not smiling at a person of color is also racist.
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:11.160]  No, I did it again.
[02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:15.680]  Students who attend a Whiteness History Month presentation at Portland College, coined the
[02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:21.600]  term white guy smile while agonizing over whether or not a white person smiling at a
[02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:25.520]  the black person is a racist microaggression.
[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:27.960]  There's all of this stuff wrapped up in how we meet
[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:29.960]  or do not meet each other's eyes.
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:31.960]  Another white female student then discusses
[02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:34.440]  how her black relatives will always talk
[02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:36.320]  about the white guy's smile.
[02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:37.560]  What are you supposed to do?
[02:30:37.560 --> 02:30:39.360]  I smile at everybody but then somehow
[02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:40.440]  I'm like conscious of that
[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:42.640]  and then I just do the white guy's smile.
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:43.880]  As much as I don't think of myself
[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:45.880]  as having that awkwardness, there's always that.
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:47.320]  Am I doing the white guy's smile
[02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:48.920]  or is it that normal smile?
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:49.920]  She asks.
[02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:51.360]  The laughing at liberals sums up
[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:53.760]  the sheer idiocy of this exchange.
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:56.200]  This has been Joe Biggs with infobores.com
[02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:58.800]  reporting on the idiocy of America.
[02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:02.240]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:31:02.240 --> 02:31:04.280]  No one has put together a formula
[02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:06.320]  that focuses directly on brain health,
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.400]  nerve growth factors and optimizing
[02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:10.520]  your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:13.680]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ,
[02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:15.960]  is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:17.120]  You want the best that's out there
[02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:18.440]  at the lowest price anywhere?

[02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:33.440]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:35.080]  with its unique delivery system
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:37.200]  and proprietary manufacturing process

[02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:58.240]  take action now before we sell out.
[02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:00.160]  AVE.
[02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:05.000]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.160]  He was a nice guy, actually.
[02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:07.000]  You like him?
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:08.840]  Oh, that's good.
[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:10.760]  Alex was a nice guy.
[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:12.440]  I know now from top people
[02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:14.360]  that you actually are for real
[02:33:14.360 --> 02:33:15.920]  and you understand you're in danger
[02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:17.760]  and you understand what you're doing
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:18.600]  is epic.
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:20.440]  And your reputation's amazing.
[02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:22.000]  I will not let you down.
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:25.360]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:26.880]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot,
[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:30.280]  but you'll be looking at me in a year or two years.
[02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:32.960]  Let's give me a little bit of time to run things.
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:35.360]  But a year into office, you'll be saying,
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:37.360]  wow, I remember that interview.
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:39.440]  He said he was gonna do it and he did a great job.
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:40.840]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:42.560]  So while with it, you probably read it.
[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:43.760]  It was in Drudge.
[02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:46.560]  Who's great, by the way, Drudge is amazing.
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:49.320]  But the story in Drudge and big story,
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:50.880]  it's all over the place now.
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:54.200]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff,
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:59.200]  struts swimming across the river, right?
[02:33:59.280 --> 02:34:00.680]  Swimming right across.
[02:34:00.680 --> 02:34:03.040]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:03.880]  They're jumping in.
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:04.920]  They just jumped in the rafts.
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:08.040]  They're coming up one, two, three, four.
[02:34:08.040 --> 02:34:10.040]  They have big satchels.
[02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:13.120]  And actually the camera crew, or the reporters,
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:16.440]  were petrified because they thought they were gonna be killed
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:17.960]  because they're showing this on camera.
[02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:20.360]  The guys carrying bags of stuff, it was drugs.
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:22.680]  That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right.
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:24.520]  That's right, that's right.
[02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:25.360]  Thank you.
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:29.480]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:30.640]  Thank you so much, sir,
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:32.000]  that you will be attacked for coming on
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:32.840]  and we know you know that.
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:33.680]  Thank you.
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:35.320]  Thank you very much.
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:40.320]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty.
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:42.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:45.520]  And we are back live.
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:47.040]  Roger Stone is getting on the line with us
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:50.520]  as we speak to break down the latest campaign news.
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:54.560]  They made a big deal out of this on CNN and MSNBC,
[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:58.080]  making fun of Mr. Stone talking about Brainforce,
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:00.480]  which is one of the top newtropics out there,
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:03.600]  brain boasters with a whole bunch of known organic compounds
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:06.000]  that boost brain activity naturally,
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:08.720]  unlike a lot of the other synthetic garbage
[02:35:08.720 --> 02:35:09.560]  and things that are out there.
[02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:11.600]  So I thought just for the interest of it
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:13.240]  while we're getting Roger on the line,
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:14.320]  let's play a clip of this.
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:17.760]  And they played this very clip on Rachel Maddowell's show
[02:35:17.760 --> 02:35:19.800]  on Chris Hayes' show and a bunch of others.
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:22.720]  It acted like it's bizarre that we sell vitamins and minerals.
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:24.000]  I mean, this is one of the biggest industries
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:24.840]  in the country.
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:26.000]  Everybody knows it's amazing.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:29.080]  Everybody knows what the things in Brainforce does.
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:31.000]  But again, they act like we're freaks,
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.560]  just like they're now acting like Democrats are bad
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:37.200]  because they want their votes for Bernie Sanders to count.
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:39.680]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:43.080]  Alex, if in a couple of weeks they tell you
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:45.800]  that I committed suicide because I was depressed,
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:48.120]  or if I get hit by a truck crossing the street,
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:50.120]  or shot by a bolt of lightning,
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:52.720]  I tell you I was killed in a freak hunting accident.
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:53.880]  Don't believe it.
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:55.880]  Hillary Clinton is a major perp
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:58.720]  and she needs to be exposed.
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:00.000]  I'm in perfectly good health.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:01.360]  I'm in a great mood.
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:02.960]  I am working 18-hour days.
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:04.360]  I want to be honest with you.
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:06.720]  I wouldn't make it without Brainforce.
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:09.160]  I went online, I bought some Brainforce.
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:10.320]  I'd pop those in the morning.
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:11.360]  I'd pop those at night.
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:13.640]  I'd get four or five more hours of work.
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:14.480]  So I-
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:15.320]  I didn't know that was coming.
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:16.160]  I know you've got more interviews coming up,
[02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:17.760]  but Roger Stone's 72nd break.
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:18.920]  Here with Gary Haven.
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:19.840]  Merrick got in the new movie.
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:20.960]  Comeback, 72nds.
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:23.000]  Finish up the lavish plug for Brainforce.
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:26.000]  And that's right, we watched.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.160]  And they played that on TV,
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:30.080]  on these shows like we're bad.
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:31.440]  This is what they're coming up with.
[02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:35.840]  But seriously, getting down to earth on this,
[02:36:35.840 --> 02:36:37.560]  I didn't plug enough last hour
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:40.320]  talking about these reactors that blow up and melt down
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:42.640]  bigger than Chernobyl or as big as Chernobyl
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:43.760]  in the middle of LA.
[02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:46.080]  And they don't even tell people this is going on.
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:48.480]  And it's barely even news on NBC News.
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:51.120]  Back in the 50s.
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:52.960]  And there's been other stuff like that.
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:56.280]  Folks are insane if they're not drinking purified water.
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:59.640]  And yes, we sell the best water filtration systems
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:01.800]  that are gravity-fed that cut all the garbage out.
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:03.360]  Promo code water, you get 10% off.
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:06.560]  Yes, we sell the true nascent pure iodine
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:08.120]  that no one else has.
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:10.000]  So I guess folks are too lazy or too dumb to do it,
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.360]  but whatever, that actually is absorbable by the body
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:14.720]  and has changed my life.
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:18.920]  And it's 20% off because I'm gonna do a big push for X2.
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:20.680]  If you haven't tried it, if you haven't used it,
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:23.480]  if you hear me talk about this and you're like eh, whatever,
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:24.680]  there's only a fraction of our listeners
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:27.840]  actually buy the X2 or the DNA force or the brain force.
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:30.320]  These are amazing products.
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:33.680]  I mean, I felt survival shield within days more energy.
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:34.600]  About three weeks later,
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:36.240]  I kind of had four or five days where I felt sick
[02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:37.680]  as Dr. Group predicted,
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:39.200]  because the detoxification accelerated.
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:40.600]  But then after that, amazing.
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:44.440]  My stamina, my aggression, my libido, it's amazing.
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:46.720]  Now, super-no-vitality is sold out right now.
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:48.600]  So is super-female, but anthroplex
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:50.080]  is basically the dry version of it.
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:52.200]  It's also organic, but it's dry herbs.
[02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:54.200]  Not as absorbable as liquid or cold press,
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:57.840]  but it's still an excellent formula and half the price.
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:37:59.800]  It works very well, has a few herbs in it
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:00.880]  that aren't in the other products
[02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:03.040]  that really is a foundation for super-male
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:05.880]  or super-female vitality and you just stack it together.
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:08.400]  You can sign up and get free shipping
[02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:10.040]  on orders of $50 or more.
[02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:13.640]  No, no, it's $50 or more free shipping.
[02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:17.880]  You sign up for auto shipping and get free shipping
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:19.120]  or no, 10% off.
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:22.480]  Again, folks, I am teleprompter free here as always.
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:24.520]  We've got so many specials who can keep track of them.
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:26.920]  10% off when you sign up for auto-ship
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:29.160]  and you can get free shipping on $50 or more
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:31.080]  and it's 20% off on survival shield,
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:33.000]  Mason I and I and X2 right now.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.440]  Try anthroplex, Try Secret 12.
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:37.800]  It's the best medical bottom and vitamin B12 out there.
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:41.640]  Try Knockout, nine different known compounds
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:42.720]  at the normal dose.
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:45.480]  Like it's 19 bucks for melatonin at this dose,
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:47.800]  the same amount, but they add filler.
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:49.160]  There's no filler in Knockout.
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:54.160]  It's melatonin, L-triptophan, the valerian root
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:56.720]  and a bunch of other stuff known.
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:38:59.360]  One pill helps me sleep if I need help.
[02:38:59.360 --> 02:39:01.520]  Two pills knocks me out.
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:03.080]  But of course, consult a physician.
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:05.480]  It's all generally seen as safe and FDA grass.
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:08.400]  That means stuff that they call a safe vitamin
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:10.080]  or a mineral or a supplement.
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:11.880]  We only sell stuff that's recognized as safe,
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.560]  but I still say consult your physician
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:15.280]  before you walk out the door in the morning,
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:18.480]  before you breathe air, before you kiss a girl,
[02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:21.480]  because the government loves you and they're God.
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:23.600]  And if MSNBC says you don't need any vitamins,
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:25.760]  they're absolutely correct and I believe them.
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:28.960]  Because look, Chris Hayes doesn't take any vitamins
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:32.800]  and he can still play his part and Rachel Maddow every day
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:34.440]  hosting two major TV shows.
[02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:35.280]  That's the big secret.
[02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:36.480]  They are one person.
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:38.160]  And it's amazing to know that.
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:42.160]  It's just incredible to know that,
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:44.320]  to know that the first lady is really,
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:46.160]  is a man, is a trainee, Michelle Obama.
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.520]  It's incredible to know that Rachel Maddow is Chris Hayes.
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:50.240]  I'm trolling you.
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:55.240]  I don't really think that, though on the whole thing
[02:39:55.920 --> 02:39:58.200]  with the first lady, something weird's going on there.
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:00.160]  But seriously, I'm just having some fun.
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:02.960]  Your audiences are so small now, you're so sad.
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:04.400]  Everybody's tuning out.
[02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:06.800]  Roger Stone doesn't care that you've black balled him
[02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:08.840]  and banned him on CNN and all these other channels
[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:11.320]  because you guys are a joke.
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:15.240]  And so thank God that so many of these Republicans,
[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:17.720]  they invited to meet with Zuckerberg, said no.
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:19.360]  They said, I'd be discredited to go into that
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:21.560]  like some prop for Zuckerberg.
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:22.960]  Think how far we've come.
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:25.720]  We knew there was censorship by Google and Facebook.
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:26.680]  Now it's all admitted.
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:28.480]  Now it's the front page of the newspapers.
[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:31.440]  Drudge and others forced it out.
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:34.240]  This whole Trump campaign has forced a debate,
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:36.880]  shown the censorship, shown the manipulation.
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:38.440]  It's very, very exciting.
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:43.200]  Now, joining us via video Skype is the one
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:46.040]  the only Roger Stone of StoneZone.com.
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:49.120]  And his best-selling book on the Clinton's War on Women
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:51.200]  is really the handbook now,
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:52.720]  really showing what monsters they are.
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.040]  But instead, they've got cover stories about Trump
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:40:57.560]  as asked women out on dates in between marriages.
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:00.200]  It's so horrible, but he's got more inside baseball
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:01.160]  in this new great pollster
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:03.360]  that he was recommending six months ago I get on
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:05.160]  and I didn't, I want to get him on now.
[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:07.400]  I just fell through the cracks.
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:09.440]  Who's a libertarian, that's exciting.
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:11.840]  And other things that are happening and going on
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:14.120]  is previous finally being good?
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:16.400]  Is previous finally not trying to get a third party?
[02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:17.440]  Is he telling the truth?
[02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:20.640]  So all things 2016, all things Trump with Roger Stone.
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:22.520]  Roger, thank you so much, my friend.
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:24.640]  Alex, great to be back with you.
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:26.040]  Well, where should we start?
[02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:29.840]  Well, let's start with the Trump campaign's
[02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:32.440]  new pollster, Tony Fabrizio.
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:34.800]  Tony Fabrizio is someone I have literally known
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:36.920]  since my early 20s.
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:39.200]  He may be the most talented and gifted,
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:43.920]  but most importantly, the most combative strategist
[02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:47.080]  and survey researcher in the Republican party.
[02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:51.000]  The truth is Tony Fabrizio is far more than a pollster.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.760]  A pollster is just a guy who takes samples
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:55.320]  of public opinion.
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:59.280]  Fabrizio has an uncanny ability to fashion that
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:01.400]  into a strategy.
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:05.920]  He's a very aggressive in-your-face street fighter.
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:07.840]  He's perfect for the campaign
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:10.480]  to take down the Clintons.
[02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:14.280]  Donald Trump spoke to Fabrizio three years ago
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:17.720]  when he was briefly considering running for president then.
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:21.800]  This is a major, major coup for the Trump campaign.
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:25.880]  Now, Fabrizio was with Rand Paul.
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:29.000]  His personal politics are very libertarian.
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:33.080]  He's exactly what the doctor ordered
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:35.960]  in terms of helping Donald Trump refine
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:39.600]  his attack strategy on the Clintons
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:42.720]  and helping him define what the key issues are going to be
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:44.440]  that decide this election.
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:48.680]  It's a 10 strike getting him on board.
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:49.920]  I'm very excited about it.
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:52.400]  Well, I remember you six months ago
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:56.160]  telling me about Fabrizio and just how key he is
[02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:57.800]  to winning this thing.
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:42:59.240]  Run us through the waterfront.
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:01.720]  I mean, folks want to know all things Trump,
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:04.560]  how the campaign's going, what the next shoot a drop is,
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.960]  what the enemy's up to, what Hillary's up to?
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:10.720]  Well, as you know, and I'm sure you've heard it, Alex,
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:12.920]  I heard it a lot today.
[02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:16.760]  Donald Trump was meeting today with Henry Kissinger.
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:19.320]  I read on info wars.com the other day
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:24.160]  that he met privately with James A. Baker, the third.
[02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:26.840]  Now, I knew he was meeting with Jim Baker,
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:29.560]  but I didn't know that was a public matter.
[02:43:29.560 --> 02:43:32.480]  And there are some in the Trump Revolution
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:34.160]  who are scratching their heads and saying,
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:39.120]  wait a minute, is Trump being co-opted by the establishment?
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:43.040]  Is he being taken over by the very people
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:45.160]  who destroyed this country?
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:49.760]  And I must tell you, I've known Trump for almost 40 years.
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:54.160]  His views on trade, his views on NATO,
[02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:59.160]  his views on Wall Street have not changed in 30 years.
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:02.600]  He is his old man.
[02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:05.160]  And he's playing the establishment.
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:06.640]  He's playing them.
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:13.160]  So in the wider population, Henry Kissinger is viewed as a sage.
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:15.840]  Alex, you and I probably do it more as a war criminal.
[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:17.160]  Absolutely.
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:19.320]  But to the American people,
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:22.400]  he's some kind of an expert on foreign policy.
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:25.000]  Believe me, Donald Trump,
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.640]  I'm sure is seeing Henry Kissinger as a courtesy.
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:32.200]  I'm sure it'll be a polite meeting, but no one,
[02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:34.960]  no one is going to get Donald Trump to change
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:38.000]  his strongly held views on immigration,
[02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.560]  on trade, on war, on the war in Iraq,
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:45.960]  which he recognized early was a mistake.
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:50.440]  I had lunch today with a journalist from the New York Times.
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.760]  She affirms that she interviewed Trump
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:58.600]  before the beginning of the Iraq War at the very beginning
[02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:02.400]  and that he was unquestionably opposed to the war.
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:03.800]  Sure, you wrote that in his book at the time.
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:04.800]  Well, I mean, let me explain on this.
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:06.520]  I said the same thing you're saying yesterday.
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:07.920]  I hadn't talked to you about your views on it yet,
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:10.400]  but I mean, it's the same because it's true.
[02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:12.720]  He has to at least talk to people.
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:14.400]  He has to at least be friendly on the surface
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:16.120]  or they will try to kill him.
[02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:19.640]  I mean, these are gangsters and he met with Haas
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:21.360]  and then Haas badmouthed him a week later
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:24.080]  because and then Trump got more nationalistic.
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:26.200]  And so that's the reason they're so scared of him.
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:29.320]  But absolutely, it ended up being in a Houston news
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:30.160]  that he was meeting with Baker.
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:31.680]  So he ran the story, you know,
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:33.120]  it's because we're gonna cover whatever Trump does,
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:37.080]  but I said on air, I don't think Trump's betraying us.
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:38.040]  It's his actions.
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:39.760]  I hope he meets with these people.
[02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:41.840]  Just like he says, he'd meet with foreign dictators
[02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:43.440]  to try to get them to change their mind.
[02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:45.640]  That's how he wants to try to influence them.
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:48.040]  I mean, we ought to be glad this is happening.
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:51.320]  Well, in fact, I don't think he wants to rush to war
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:53.280]  with the Chinese or the Russians.
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:57.960]  I think he would usher in an entire new era of negotiations,
[02:45:57.960 --> 02:46:00.960]  but hardheaded negotiations.
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:04.440]  Negotiations where the best interests of the United States.
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:06.560]  Sure, a president that wouldn't sell us out,
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:08.920]  a president would make good deals.
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:12.120]  But I just, I wanna reassure those people
[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:17.120]  with the grassroots because you have his naming fellow
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:21.000]  from Goldman Sachs is his finance chairman,
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:22.720]  remains to be seen whether that gentleman
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:27.480]  can raise the $1 billion that Donald Trump is going to need.
[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:30.440]  You have him meeting with Baker,
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:34.680]  who is an expert on the institution.
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:36.640]  Somebody who was in that meeting told me
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:41.480]  that 80% of the discussion was Trump questioning Baker
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:45.040]  about how Ronald Reagan ran his administration,
[02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:49.640]  how he ran his presidency, what Reagan's day was like.
[02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:53.320]  So it sounds to me like Donald Trump benefited
[02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:54.840]  from that meeting.
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:57.800]  The Henry Kissinger thing I view as a touchstone,
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:00.720]  but anyone who thinks Kissinger could talk Trump
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:03.000]  out of his views doesn't understand.
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:04.640]  Absolutely, he's meeting with Kissinger
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:06.880]  so he can say, look, I talked to the supposed
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:09.840]  foreign policy wonk that the media worships.
[02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:12.840]  Yeah, I think that's exactly right.
[02:47:12.840 --> 02:47:14.880]  I don't think that there is much value.
[02:47:14.880 --> 02:47:16.280]  Well, I mean, like my audience gets it,
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:18.120]  they understand him to beat Hillary.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:19.480]  He's not gonna have to compromise.
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:20.440]  He's not gonna break eggs.
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:22.480]  He's gonna follow the policies he said.
[02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:23.960]  That's why they're so scared of him,
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:25.480]  but he's gonna have to raise money.
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:28.360]  He's gonna have to get his hands dirty a little bit
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:30.040]  because this is a dirty business, period.
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:32.240]  I mean, he says, I don't like the system
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:34.000]  of buying off politicians, but it's legal.
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.440]  It's what I have to do to do business.
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:36.320]  I wanna change it.
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:38.640]  I don't like making my ties in Mexico or China.
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:39.560]  It's cost prohibitive.
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:40.680]  You can't do it here.
[02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:42.760]  He goes, okay, I got hats made in America.
[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:44.080]  They're twice the price, buy them.
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:45.080]  You know, I mean, I get it.
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:46.120]  I've been through it myself.
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:46.960]  I understand that.
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:49.760]  I tell people, we have shirts and hats made in America
[02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:52.160]  and they're $30 and we have shirts and hats made in Mexico
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:53.480]  and they're $15.
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:47:55.280]  So, you know, you make your choice
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:56.800]  and people want the $15 ones.
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:57.800]  I mean, I get it.
[02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:00.880]  Well, and let's go step further.
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:02.840]  It's CYA money.
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:07.840]  So the Wall Street types, the K Street types,
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:10.680]  they are going to cover their derriere.
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:13.120]  I want a president who is smart enough
[02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:15.640]  not to turn that money down.
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:18.320]  It's like the question that I keep asking Trump,
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:19.960]  how much did you pay in taxes?
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:24.160]  And his answer is, as little as I possibly can.
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:25.480]  That's the guy I want watching this.
[02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:28.760]  Yeah, I mean, I hope, I hope as IRS stuff comes out
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:30.600]  and he's really not trying to pay the IRS.
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:32.640]  That's what kind of thing I wanna see.
[02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:34.680]  Well, I don't think he's broken any laws, but I-
[02:48:34.680 --> 02:48:36.840]  No, I know, but I mean, none of it goes around the country.
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:38.520]  As Reagan's commission found with Congress,
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:39.600]  it all goes to the debt.
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:41.280]  It keeps the economy in the toilet.
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:43.120]  The elites are offshore and don't pay tax.
[02:48:43.120 --> 02:48:44.560]  So, I mean, look,
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:48.720]  Warren Buffett tries to avoid taxes, says, raise him.
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:52.400]  Trump tries to avoid taxes and says, cut some, I love that.
[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:54.560]  Well, yeah, when I, day before yesterday,
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:58.880]  I had a delegation from the Chinese government
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:01.240]  contact me, they wanted to have lunch.
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:03.440]  I went to lunch with a bunch of diplomats.
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:04.800]  It was very pleasant.
[02:49:04.800 --> 02:49:07.720]  They wanted to know one thing and one thing only.
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:10.760]  Is Donald Trump really going to cut the corporate tax rate
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:14.600]  of the United States below that of China?
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:18.360]  They are petrified, Alex, that he's going to do this
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:20.160]  because they know exactly what will happen.
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:24.280]  The giant US corporations doing business in China
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:27.440]  will all return to the United States to expand here,
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:30.800]  to hire here, to create jobs here.
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:33.680]  And that is, of course, not in the best interests
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:34.920]  of the Chinese.
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:36.840]  I like the idea of a president
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:39.360]  who puts the interest of the United States first.
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:41.400]  I think that's what the voters find most refreshing
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:42.400]  about Donald Trump.
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:45.040]  Well, that's incredible.
[02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:46.720]  So they are just horrified.
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:48.680]  But look, it's a level playing field
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:50.160]  and he likes to make deals that are fair
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:52.160]  because he wants to have business back and forth.
[02:49:52.160 --> 02:49:53.280]  When you talk to Trump, I mean,
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:54.760]  I know he's put some specifics out.
[02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:56.920]  What would be fair just to lower it
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:58.680]  to the point maybe of China
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:01.720]  and then to do things like make them raise their currency?
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:05.560]  We are currently at 35% as the corporate tax rate.
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:08.200]  China is at 25%.
[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:12.280]  We could drop our rate to 20 or even better, 15.
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:15.600]  And you would suck all those companies out of China
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:16.960]  and back to the United States.
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:17.840]  That's right.
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:18.920]  Now you have also,
[02:50:18.920 --> 02:50:23.040]  which is far more effective than tariffs would be.
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:26.000]  You also have this program for inversion,
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.240]  bring back about $2 trillion
[02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:31.680]  that is sitting offshore untaxed
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:33.720]  to be taxed at a fair rate.
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:36.080]  And then Trump is the only presidential candidate
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:39.600]  who's recognized that there's almost a trillion dollars
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:42.680]  sitting in the federal checking accounts,
[02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:45.800]  which has never been swept, that is unbudgeted.
[02:50:45.800 --> 02:50:48.840]  So before you start cutting social programs,
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:50.240]  let's go get that money.
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:55.000]  Trump has the most dynamic and really the most pro-growth.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:55.840]  That's right.
[02:50:55.840 --> 02:50:57.600]  And he won't shut down another thousand plants
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:50:58.840]  like Obama did,
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:01.040]  which will try to keep us competitive on energy.
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:02.280]  I mean, he will literally,
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:05.760]  all he's doing is gonna take Count Dracula off our neck,
[02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:08.800]  just taking the vampire off, we could get better.
[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:10.400]  But we have to get Count Dracula off
[02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:12.600]  and globalism is Count Dracula.
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:13.440]  Agreed.
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:16.400]  Now you asked me about obstacles for the campaign.
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:20.400]  I do wanna warn your viewers and your listeners
[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:24.000]  about this great America pack.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.640]  This is run by Ed Rollins,
[02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:29.320]  who actually works for Tanao,
[02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:31.560]  which is, he's a senior advisor there.
[02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:36.560]  Tanao is a Bill and Hillary Clinton connected lobbying firm
[02:51:37.680 --> 02:51:41.120]  that paid Bill Clinton about $2 million a year.
[02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:44.920]  Rollins cohort in great America pack
[02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:46.720]  is a fellow named Jesse Benton.
[02:51:46.720 --> 02:51:47.680]  Oh boy.
[02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:49.040]  He's a convicted felon,
[02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:52.600]  a convicted just last week of bribing people in Iowa
[02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:54.920]  to support Ron Paul.
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:59.040]  He drove Ron Paul and Rand Paul's campaigns
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:00.680]  into the toilet.
[02:52:00.680 --> 02:52:04.120]  He is devoid of any political skill.
[02:52:04.120 --> 02:52:06.920]  This particular pack, great America pack,
[02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:10.760]  has a $600,000 debt on the books.
[02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:11.600]  And-
[02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:12.760]  And that's the one I've seen in the news
[02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:14.800]  that's kind of acting like it represents Trump.
[02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:15.640]  And so-
[02:52:15.640 --> 02:52:16.480]  Yeah.
[02:52:16.480 --> 02:52:18.400]  I mean, Rollins, who's never been a Trump supporter
[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:19.240]  keeps now-
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:20.640]  Well, I mean, you even heard our guest in here
[02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:21.880]  where they're contacting him,
[02:52:21.880 --> 02:52:23.240]  acting like they represent Trump
[02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:24.960]  to put him on Trump's advisory board.
[02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:27.400]  And Trump is actually in the news of his lawyers saying,
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:29.320]  don't give money to this group.
[02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:31.240]  Yeah, I mean, look, this is a scam.
[02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:32.080]  And you're-
[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:33.920]  And I'm sure if you're like me
[02:52:33.920 --> 02:52:36.480]  and you're on every pro-conservative
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:38.080]  and pro-liberty mailing list,
[02:52:38.080 --> 02:52:41.000]  you're getting inundated with these appeals.
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:42.080]  Don't fall for it.
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:44.240]  These folks said they were going to spend
[02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:46.720]  $1 million to help Trump.
[02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:49.680]  They wrote a million dollar check to a media buyer,
[02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:51.240]  but then the New York Times determined
[02:52:51.240 --> 02:52:55.720]  that they only spent $100,000 on ads in the primaries.
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:52:58.560]  So this is a fraud.
[02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:00.480]  And the hard-earned dollars
[02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:03.000]  of individual mom-and-pop donors.
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:03.840]  Sure, sure.
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:06.000]  I mean, no, we have to also watch out for straw men
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.720]  with like, not this group, but other groups,
[02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:09.360]  where they put out fake Trump supporters
[02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:10.720]  and then have them say outrageous stuff.
[02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:13.000]  I mean, that's what type of dirty tricks do you expect next?
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.040]  Because you said the woman thing, the mafia thing,
[02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:17.680]  they've done all that now, the fake lawsuits.
[02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:19.280]  What else is coming?
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:22.360]  Well, the New York Times piece, I think, is a watershed.
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:26.040]  And I give great credit to the Trump campaign
[02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:27.720]  because they were able to roll out
[02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:31.640]  a number of the women who were quoted in the story,
[02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:33.720]  but who were quoted out of context.
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:37.200]  And in many cases, the times divine
[02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:38.560]  what these women were thinking.
[02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:41.440]  Oh, she felt degraded when Trump said,
[02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:44.000]  why don't you put on a bathing suit?
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.320]  These women didn't feel degraded at all.
[02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:48.280]  I think the mainstream media here,
[02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:50.680]  the New York Times particularly has made a mistake, Alex,
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:53.880]  because they have now set a standard.
[02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:57.800]  If we're going to examine the conduct of Donald Trump
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:53:59.280]  towards women in the 70s-
[02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:02.080]  We've got to look at Bill Clinton and the Pito Plain.
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:07.080]  We got to look at Bubba and his serial rapes, his assaults,
[02:54:08.640 --> 02:54:11.080]  his exposing himself to women.
[02:54:11.080 --> 02:54:13.640]  And then we come to the question of the credibility
[02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:15.840]  of his accusers.
[02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:18.480]  I believe every one of these women,
[02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:22.200]  Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones,
[02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:25.400]  Christy Zurcher, Sandra Allen, James, and many others,
[02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:29.280]  every one of them is more credible than Hillary Clinton.
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:32.720]  Based on the public record, based on all the other lies
[02:54:32.720 --> 02:54:35.520]  Hillary has told, whether it is lying about
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:37.600]  being broke when you left the White House,
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:40.960]  or lying about stealing the silver
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:43.920]  and the furniture in the China when they left the White House,
[02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:47.120]  or lying about whether her grandparents were immigrants,
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:50.480]  or lying about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary,
[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:53.520]  or lying about the reason that four brave Americans
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:54.720]  died in Benghazi.
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:56.000]  What about what about Brian Williams,
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.880]  when she claimed that she was in the Balkans
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:00.640]  and got shot at, attacked all baloney?
[02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:03.440]  I mean, this woman is the definition of a liar.
[02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:04.720]  Yeah, no, the sniper fire.
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:06.640]  She was under sniper fire.
[02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:10.160]  She lies about who the real father of Chelsea Clinton is.
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:12.240]  She lies about cattle futures
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:15.960]  and how she made a killing with insider trader information.
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:19.320]  In all honesty, every one of these women
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:21.680]  who bears accusations against Bill Clinton
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:26.240]  will be found to be more credible than Hillary.
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:27.400]  Well, they settled.
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:29.080]  They settled some of these rape cases.
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:30.480]  I mean, we've got them.
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:35.720]  Well, Paul and Jones settled for $850,000.
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:38.000]  There is no admission of guilt by Bill Clinton
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.840]  in all fairness, but I can see what's coming
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:44.640]  and it's very important that people understand it.
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:48.680]  Anyone who questions the Clinton's narrative of things
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:52.840]  is immediately branded as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:55.360]  That's not a compliment when they say that.
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:56.560]  You're a kook.
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:55:57.720]  You're a nut.
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:00.640]  You believe everything that's in the National Enquirer.
[02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:02.400]  With all due respect, the National Enquirer
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:04.760]  is more accurate than the Washington Post.
[02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:05.920]  They broke the John Edwards...
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:07.400]  Sure, but I mean, that doesn't work anymore
[02:56:07.400 --> 02:56:08.680]  when they call it conspiracy theorist.
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:10.400]  Have they figured that out yet?
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:11.800]  No, they really haven't.
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:14.600]  This is why Media Matters for America,
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:19.160]  the George Soros-funded Clinton Apologist Group,
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:23.440]  the rape enablers, or call them rape deniers, if you will,
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:25.160]  who try to whitewash anything done
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:28.120]  by Bill, Hillary, or Chelsea Clinton,
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:32.120]  they are every day just out there attacking the messenger.
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:34.880]  Whether it's Alex Jones, whether it's Roger Stone,
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:36.560]  it's a constant vilification.
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:38.480]  Here's what they'd understand.
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:40.480]  I'm not running for president.
[02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:42.040]  You're not my running mate.
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:43.520]  This isn't about us.
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:45.160]  Let me go further and say this.
[02:56:45.160 --> 02:56:47.360]  They attack what they're most afraid of
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:49.080]  as if they have the moral high ground
[02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:52.240]  and a trick that they're labeling us as embarrassing
[02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:53.680]  is why they're targeting us.
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:55.720]  But if you look at what we've covered the last year,
[02:56:55.720 --> 02:56:58.480]  they're targeting and labeling what they're most afraid of
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:01.840]  and hoping that Trump doesn't start beating the drum on.
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:04.800]  And I know Trump's sophisticated enough to understand that.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:07.120]  Well, I understand that Donald Trump
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:09.160]  is on with Sean Hannity tonight.
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:12.960]  I think this is going to be a very, very important interview.
[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:16.280]  And I hope folks will tune in
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:19.560]  because this entire question of women
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.920]  and conduct towards women is now at the forefront.
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:26.120]  And the mainstream media would like to define this
[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:31.120]  as indiscretions or affairs or adultery or cheating.
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:33.000]  But it's none of those things.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:36.640]  It's about rape and sexual assault
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:39.840]  and the abuse of men and women by the court.
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:41.840]  Sure, are you predicting we're going to be here
[02:57:41.840 --> 02:57:44.120]  and some of that tonight from Trump?
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:45.600]  I know nothing.
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:48.520]  I know that he is very hunkered down.
[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:53.400]  He is offended by the New York Times story as he should be.
[02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:55.440]  It's a hatchet job.
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:57:58.560]  And Trump is the greatest counterpuncher
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:01.080]  in American political history.
[02:58:01.080 --> 02:58:02.880]  So I will be anxious to tune in
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:04.320]  and I know you will be also.
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:07.560]  All right, well, Roger, thank you for popping in with us
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:08.400]  this week.

[02:58:15.800 --> 02:58:16.760]  You're coming to Austin soon.

[02:59:01.520 --> 02:59:04.360]  I am a relatively short-time listener
[02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:08.200]  and a quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[02:59:08.200 --> 02:59:09.560]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[02:59:09.560 --> 02:59:11.240]  It's so easy to get these incredible
[02:59:11.240 --> 02:59:13.280]  nutraceuticals that support your health
[02:59:13.280 --> 02:59:15.400]  and the InfoWar at the same time.
[02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:16.320]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:19.120]  I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX,
[02:59:19.120 --> 02:59:19.960]  Nathan Ida.
[02:59:19.960 --> 02:59:20.800]  Why?
[02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:21.640]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:22.480]  Have they worked for you?
[02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:23.480]  They're the most unbelievable products
[02:59:23.480 --> 02:59:24.720]  I've ever had in my life.
[02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:26.000]  What products are you taking?
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:26.840]  Are you taking?
[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:29.720]  Everything from SuperMail to brain force
[02:59:29.720 --> 02:59:34.080]  to Winterson, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:35.920]  So when I just re-upped everything
[02:59:35.920 --> 02:59:37.760]  and I just went to Autofill.
[02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:40.600]  Visit infowarslifes.com to read the information
[02:59:40.600 --> 02:59:42.760]  and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:47.520]  That's infowarslifes.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:59:50.800 --> 02:59:53.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:57.720 --> 02:59:58.560]  Pfft!
[03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:05.040]  We're about to go after this liner
[03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:07.560]  to Paul Joseph Lawson from Her Majesty's
[03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:08.960]  Supreme Command Base, London.
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:16.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:19.760]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:22.360]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[03:00:25.400 --> 03:00:26.680]  We're gonna come in with London Dungeon
[03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:28.720]  in the next segment just to make sure
[03:00:28.720 --> 03:00:30.520]  the culture's very high around here.
[03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:33.760]  All right, continue.
[03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:35.480]  We're going to Paul Watson here in about two minutes
[03:00:35.480 --> 03:00:37.680]  only hear what he's coming up with in the next hour.
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:39.360]  Okay, this is an hour I don't like to miss
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:40.440]  even though I've got to go do business
[03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:41.400]  around the office and get ready.
[03:00:41.400 --> 03:00:43.640]  I'm gonna go have the rest of my lunch
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:45.160]  for about 30 minutes and watch myself
[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:46.840]  because Watson does such a great job.
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:48.080]  We'll be talking to him in a moment about that.
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:50.280]  I just barely plugged at the end of the hour
[03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:52.160]  that we're running one of the biggest specials ever
[03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:56.240]  on Nation Iodine for I think it's just a week or so,
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:59.600]  maybe even less because we don't want to run
[03:00:59.600 --> 03:01:02.360]  out of the supply and then have done of it for months
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:03.720]  because these sales can do that.
[03:01:03.720 --> 03:01:06.120]  It's not a for auto ship, it's an additional 10% off
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:08.200]  of the 20% off so you can stack that
[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:10.600]  and free shipping on orders of $50 or more
[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:15.600]  at infoworkslife.com but it's not just free shipping
[03:01:16.120 --> 03:01:18.800]  for this on orders of 50, it's all orders
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:21.720]  and 10% off all orders, it's not a for auto ship.
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:24.640]  We also have ultra powerful secret 12,
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:26.120]  out of B12 back in stock.
[03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:27.960]  Look at studies that are out about Alzheimer's,
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:30.600]  depression, mental problems from bad absorption
[03:01:30.600 --> 03:01:31.720]  of out of B12.
[03:01:31.720 --> 03:01:33.280]  Most people's guts aren't absorbing
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:35.760]  but maybe 1% of it, you need it under the tongue
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:36.600]  or injected.
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:40.640]  This is under the tongue and it's the second best thing
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:42.960]  to injections, it's a lot bigger dust so you get
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:44.840]  as much as with an injection from our research
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:47.640]  infoworkslife.com, check it out today.
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:50.600]  Anthroplex is back in stock, super mail's been sold out
[03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:51.960]  as you know for awhile so it's female
[03:01:51.960 --> 03:01:53.440]  but this is a similar formula.
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:55.760]  It's quicked as a base for the other formulas
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:58.000]  so it works well and it's half the price
[03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.600]  but they're both excellent infoworkslife.com again
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:02.320]  for that, vitamin mineral fusions and back in
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:03.360]  for a week.
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:05.760]  What we set out to make is the best full spectrum
[03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:09.040]  vitamin mineral, multi vitamin fruit punch,
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:12.200]  totally natural, totally healthy, naturally flavored
[03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:13.760]  by the vitamins and minerals that are in it
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:16.280]  and a small dose of xylitol that's very healthy.
[03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:20.000]  It's just too good and get rid of the fruit juices
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:21.840]  and all the rest of the garbage and the soda pop
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:24.120]  and have this and I know I've certainly seen
[03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:25.800]  some of my children that had a few pounds on them
[03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:27.960]  from fruit juice, lose that weight very, very quickly
[03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:29.040]  being on this the last few months
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:31.800]  because we had it before it even came out.
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:34.080]  Go check out the almost five star reviews
[03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:37.440]  infoworkslife.com today and know that your purchase
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:39.160]  funds this operation and everything we do
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:42.280]  but if you've never taken X2 and haven't experienced
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:44.840]  the good halogen, you're crazy folks.
[03:02:44.840 --> 03:02:46.480]  You cannot lose on this because you're funding
[03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:49.440]  the operation at the same time and almost everybody
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:51.360]  we talked to gets dramatic results.
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:52.920]  Consult your physician beforehand though
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:54.920]  it's generally seen as safe.
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:57.720]  These only sell stuff that's listed as safe but who knows?
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:02:59.720]  Oxygen might kill you so consult your physician
[03:02:59.720 --> 03:03:00.840]  before breathing.
[03:03:00.840 --> 03:03:03.880]  Paul Watson, briefly tell us what's coming up
[03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:06.240]  but I gotta just say your George Pliny video
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:07.440]  that's the direction I wanna go.
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:10.560]  These people, I wanna do things on Bono,
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:13.240]  the hypocrisy of these people, how they have bodyguards,
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:15.240]  how they want us to be disarmed.
[03:03:15.240 --> 03:03:17.400]  I love the direction you're going in Paul.
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:20.680]  What do folks think of your F. George Pliny video?
[03:03:20.680 --> 03:03:24.200]  Well it's quite popular I think is around 400,000 views
[03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:26.960]  over the past few days and actually got over a million
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:30.360]  on Facebook so yeah I mean let's just take the gloves off.
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:33.440]  I'm sick of these people grandstanding in the media.
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:36.080]  You know it's virtue signaling on steroids
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:37.640]  and nobody calls them out about it.
[03:03:37.640 --> 03:03:40.960]  Nobody calls Clooney out for having five mansions
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:43.000]  and not taking in a single refugee
[03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:46.160]  while demanding that German citizens do the same
[03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:48.080]  as their society melts down
[03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:50.200]  as they're being kicked out of their own social housing
[03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:52.880]  and these people need to be taken to task
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:55.320]  and that's what I plan to do even more in the future.
[03:03:55.320 --> 03:03:56.720]  I know you're gonna be covering this.
[03:03:56.720 --> 03:04:00.400]  I was speechless reading the Pope's interview
[03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:02.040]  with one of the biggest newspapers in Europe
[03:04:02.040 --> 03:04:04.800]  saying we need to get rid of Europeans.
[03:04:04.800 --> 03:04:07.640]  Isis is like Christ, Christians are bad,
[03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:09.240]  we don't wanna be Christians now.
[03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:11.560]  I mean this is the most over the top thing.
[03:04:11.560 --> 03:04:12.800]  What are the elite doing?
[03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:13.800]  I mean this is crazy.
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:18.520]  Well they're bringing in huge numbers of people
[03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:20.200]  who will vote for bigger government.
[03:04:20.200 --> 03:04:23.160]  That's why big government likes mass immigration.
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:25.320]  Business likes it because it's cheap labor.
[03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:26.160]  They can strangle out there.
[03:04:26.160 --> 03:04:28.480]  So this is the collectivist in game.
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:30.120]  Yeah, so it's a perfect match
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:33.920]  and now the Pope is basically invoking the same rhetoric
[03:04:33.920 --> 03:04:36.680]  as Islamist preachers who openly say
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:40.400]  this migration wave is a plan to conquer Europe.
[03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:43.400]  Now he's openly aligned himself with them
[03:04:43.400 --> 03:04:45.320]  just as Isis in their own manifesto said
[03:04:45.320 --> 03:04:46.720]  they were aligned with the left.
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:50.080]  Stay there, Paul Joseph Watson, the apprentice.
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:51.620]  Straight ahead on the other side,
[03:04:51.620 --> 03:04:54.960]  I'm Alex Jones from the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:04:54.960 --> 03:04:57.300]  The heart of human resistance against terror.
[03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:00.960]  Black Iowa student starts fight, loses,
[03:05:00.960 --> 03:05:02.680]  makes up, hate crime, gets caught.
[03:05:02.680 --> 03:05:05.040]  Oh it's claimed on the night of April 30th
[03:05:05.040 --> 03:05:08.640]  he was attacked by three evil white college age men
[03:05:08.640 --> 03:05:11.320]  who beat him bloody while screaming racial slurs.
[03:05:11.320 --> 03:05:13.120]  Activist students claim the attacks show
[03:05:13.120 --> 03:05:15.720]  a climate of racial hatred in Iowa city
[03:05:15.720 --> 03:05:17.480]  and they also denounce the university
[03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:20.400]  for taking until May 4th to issue a statement
[03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:21.560]  about the matter.
[03:05:21.560 --> 03:05:25.240]  How many black students must be a victim of hate crime
[03:05:25.240 --> 03:05:27.040]  before an alert is sent out
[03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:30.480]  once students complain online at the time.
[03:05:30.480 --> 03:05:33.240]  But footage which was released by police
[03:05:33.240 --> 03:05:35.600]  shows a very different series of events.
[03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:38.520]  The footage shows Owens entered the bar close to midnight
[03:05:38.520 --> 03:05:40.400]  and then getting involved in a massive bar
[03:05:40.400 --> 03:05:42.120]  mainly around 1.35 a.m.
[03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:44.080]  He was kicked out of the bar and then proceeded
[03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:47.200]  to get in two additional fights within the next 10 minutes
[03:05:47.200 --> 03:05:49.800]  and all of the fights Owens is acting aggressively
[03:05:49.800 --> 03:05:51.480]  and throwing punches and police say
[03:05:51.480 --> 03:05:53.720]  he appears to have been the instigator
[03:05:53.720 --> 03:05:56.040]  in at least a few of the fights.
[03:05:56.040 --> 03:05:58.560]  This is Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[03:05:58.560 --> 03:06:00.080]  You're investing in your health
[03:06:00.080 --> 03:06:03.320]  and supporting the info war when you visit infowarslife.com
[03:06:03.320 --> 03:06:05.360]  and purchase your supply of survival shield
[03:06:05.360 --> 03:06:07.880]  X2 nascent iodine and all the great products
[03:06:07.880 --> 03:06:09.080]  at infowarslife.com.
[03:06:09.080 --> 03:06:10.760]  As you know we've talked to pharmacists,
[03:06:10.760 --> 03:06:13.320]  chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists
[03:06:13.320 --> 03:06:14.960]  and the answer is clear.
[03:06:14.960 --> 03:06:17.240]  Iodine is key, is paramount
[03:06:17.240 --> 03:06:20.000]  and there's still so much new information coming out
[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.280]  that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[03:06:22.280 --> 03:06:24.480]  In our quest for the purest iodine,
[03:06:24.480 --> 03:06:27.160]  we drill down more than 7,000 feet
[03:06:27.160 --> 03:06:29.000]  to gather these purple blue crystals
[03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.200]  to extract the ultra pure iodine.
[03:06:31.200 --> 03:06:33.480]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine
[03:06:33.480 --> 03:06:35.080]  for radiation before bottling.
[03:06:35.080 --> 03:06:38.000]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.240]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch
[03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:42.240]  of survival shield nascent iodine
[03:06:42.240 --> 03:06:44.480]  that major brands and major companies
[03:06:44.480 --> 03:06:46.720]  have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:48.720]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything
[03:06:48.720 --> 03:06:50.800]  even close to what we have.
[03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:54.400]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com

[03:06:58.480 --> 03:07:02.440]  Secret 12, infowarslife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:05.640]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed
[03:07:05.640 --> 03:07:08.200]  and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[03:07:08.200 --> 03:07:09.040]  by the body.
[03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:10.360]  That's why for real results,
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:13.680]  so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections
[03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:16.040]  which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:18.760]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce

[03:07:28.560 --> 03:07:31.360]  bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12,
[03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:34.320]  methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections
[03:07:34.320 --> 03:07:36.120]  and adenosylcobalamin.
[03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:38.120]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth,
[03:07:38.120 --> 03:07:39.760]  right on the tongue and then swallowed.
[03:07:39.760 --> 03:07:41.680]  No needles, no injections.
[03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:43.280]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:07:43.280 --> 03:07:44.560]  Try it for yourself.
[03:07:44.560 --> 03:07:46.800]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[03:07:54.880 --> 03:07:57.200]  Infowars Life, Secret 12.
[03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:04.480]  They took my saddle and used it.
[03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:07.560]  Broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[03:08:09.440 --> 03:08:12.560]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[03:08:12.560 --> 03:08:15.440]  Somewhere along the way.
[03:08:15.440 --> 03:08:18.680]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:22.720]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that game.
[03:08:22.720 --> 03:08:25.720]  And I hope that judging flies.
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:27.120]  The fourth hour live,
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:29.080]  old driver of the Alex Jones show with me,
[03:08:29.080 --> 03:08:32.000]  Paul Joseph Watson, and this is the day
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:35.320]  on which the mainstream media finally admitted
[03:08:35.320 --> 03:08:37.840]  that they were astounded by the discovery
[03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:42.080]  that Bernie Sanders supporters are violent radicals
[03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:43.160]  because it's not like, you know,
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:46.200]  they've been punching Trump supporters in the face,
[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:50.400]  spitting in their face, punching police horses,
[03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:53.000]  staging riots at Trump speech and events.
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:56.560]  For the past three months, it's not like that ever happened.
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:08:59.000]  The moment they do it to Democrats,
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:00.960]  it's suddenly this huge revelation
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:04.960]  that Bernie Sanders supporters are violent radicals,
[03:09:04.960 --> 03:09:06.960]  but still they try to blame it on Trump.
[03:09:06.960 --> 03:09:10.160]  Listen to this headline out of the Sacramento Bee.
[03:09:10.160 --> 03:09:13.200]  Bernie Sanders can't afford to stay silent any longer.
[03:09:13.200 --> 03:09:17.720]  Rise of extremist supporters causing a rift in the party.
[03:09:17.720 --> 03:09:19.560]  And notice in this sub headline,
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:23.320]  they still managed to blame it on Donald Trump.
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:26.680]  In Nevada, which is where we saw all the violence
[03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:29.480]  on the weekend from Bernie Sanders supporters,
[03:09:29.480 --> 03:09:33.200]  Trump like anger boils over at state convention.
[03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:37.920]  So even in their admission that Bernie Sanders supporters
[03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:40.560]  are unhinged violent radicals,
[03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:44.080]  they still managed to equate it to Donald Trump.
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:46.440]  Now, were there a few instance where, you know,
[03:09:46.440 --> 03:09:48.880]  individual Trump supporters got overexcited,
[03:09:48.880 --> 03:09:52.000]  physically assaulted a couple of people at Trump events?
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:53.320]  Yeah, that happened.
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:56.320]  But nowhere near the scale of unrest
[03:09:56.320 --> 03:09:59.200]  that we've seen from these Bernie Sanders supporters.
[03:09:59.200 --> 03:10:02.760]  So they've been doing it to conservatives for months.
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:04.680]  The mainstream media has completely ignored it
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:08.000]  and continued to blame Trump for any violence.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:12.040]  The moment they do anything against establishment Democrat,
[03:10:12.040 --> 03:10:15.240]  that's when the mainstream media cries foul.
[03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:16.920]  This is from the article.
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:19.120]  A lot of Democrats don't want to admit it,
[03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:21.920]  but Donald Trump isn't the only presidential candidate
[03:10:21.920 --> 03:10:25.880]  playing with fire and recklessly courting an angry mob.
[03:10:25.880 --> 03:10:28.880]  So again, in the very first paragraph,
[03:10:28.880 --> 03:10:31.040]  they blame it on Donald Trump.
[03:10:31.040 --> 03:10:32.560]  They have to get that in there
[03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:34.680]  that Trump is courting an angry mob,
[03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:36.600]  even though the scenes at Trump events
[03:10:36.600 --> 03:10:39.920]  have been nowhere near on the level
[03:10:39.920 --> 03:10:42.760]  of what Bernie Sanders supporters have engaged in.
[03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:44.440]  And, you know, we've sent our reporters there,
[03:10:44.440 --> 03:10:45.760]  we've got the video out.
[03:10:45.760 --> 03:10:48.200]  What you see over and over again is
[03:10:48.200 --> 03:10:51.280]  calm, composed Donald Trump supporters
[03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:53.480]  lining up around the block for an event,
[03:10:53.480 --> 03:10:58.480]  being goaded, being provoked by Bernie Sanders radicals.
[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:00.400]  These are the same people who, you know,
[03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:02.720]  if they were around in the 70s, would have supported
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:04.640]  the weather underground.
[03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:06.160]  I mean, go back and listen to that interview
[03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:09.160]  with Larry Grathwall of the FBI,
[03:11:09.160 --> 03:11:11.120]  where he's basically asked,
[03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:12.720]  of course, he was the FBI agent
[03:11:12.720 --> 03:11:14.640]  who infiltrated the weather underground.
[03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:17.720]  He was at all their meetings with Bill Ayers and others.
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:19.080]  And he was asked,
[03:11:19.080 --> 03:11:20.760]  what was the plan for these people
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:22.680]  if Americans didn't go along
[03:11:22.680 --> 03:11:25.080]  with their radical communist agenda?
[03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:26.600]  And he basically said,
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:28.560]  well, at first they would all be herded
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:31.320]  into reeducation camps.
[03:11:31.320 --> 03:11:32.880]  And if they then didn't submit
[03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:35.280]  and accept the new way of doing things,
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:37.720]  they would be killed en masse.
[03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:39.040]  And that's the kind of mindset
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:41.720]  that has pervaded the radical left
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:42.880]  throughout the past, you know,
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:45.280]  four or five decades in the United States.
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:48.720]  Of course, it has on some elements of the radical right,
[03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:51.240]  but the mainstream media will never draw attention
[03:11:51.240 --> 03:11:55.080]  to extremist violence when it's on the left.
[03:11:55.080 --> 03:11:58.280]  So this, these events in Nevada on the weekend
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:02.080]  have come as a massive surprise, apparently,
[03:12:02.080 --> 03:12:03.800]  to mainstream Democrats,
[03:12:03.800 --> 03:12:06.200]  even though we've been pointing at months
[03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:10.200]  that Bernie Sanders supporters are violent radicals.
[03:12:10.200 --> 03:12:12.280]  Let's go to this Diane Feinstein clip,
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:14.960]  where she basically expresses her shock
[03:12:14.960 --> 03:12:17.480]  and surprise at this and says that
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:19.560]  a similar meltdown as we saw
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:21.480]  in the 68 Chicago convention,
[03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:22.520]  where there were riots,
[03:12:22.520 --> 03:12:25.440]  could be coming up later this year.
[03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:26.960]  Let's go to this clip.
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:29.000]  How much does it worry you that he wants to take this
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:30.800]  to the convention in July?
[03:12:30.800 --> 03:12:33.680]  Well, it worries me a great deal.
[03:12:33.680 --> 03:12:37.560]  You know, I don't want to go back to the 68 convention
[03:12:37.560 --> 03:12:40.360]  because I worry about what it does
[03:12:40.360 --> 03:12:43.440]  to the electric as a whole, and he should too.
[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:48.760]  So, yeah, there's Diane Feinstein on CNN
[03:12:48.760 --> 03:12:51.600]  basically invoking the threat of riots
[03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:54.400]  at the Democratic convention that's coming up.
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:57.760]  So again, it's this bizarre, sudden discovery,
[03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:01.000]  sudden surprise that Bernie Sanders supporters are violent.
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:02.080]  I mean, look at the headlines
[03:13:02.080 --> 03:13:05.040]  that we were publishing, again, for months,
[03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:08.240]  even before what happened in Chicago at the Trump event.
[03:13:08.240 --> 03:13:11.360]  Rap song threatens riots, Trump assassination,
[03:13:11.360 --> 03:13:13.200]  media celebrates.
[03:13:13.200 --> 03:13:15.000]  Every time one of these rap groups,
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.680]  and they weren't just losers on YouTube, in this case,
[03:13:17.680 --> 03:13:20.000]  it was quite influential rapper.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:23.000]  You know, they came out with songs saying F Trump,
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:24.720]  we're gonna kill Donald Trump,
[03:13:24.720 --> 03:13:27.280]  we've got a chopper in the trunk for Donald Trump,
[03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:30.680]  we're gonna fill him with hollow point bullets.
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:33.200]  Those were the kind of lyrics in these songs.
[03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:35.560]  And the media celebrated it.
[03:13:35.560 --> 03:13:40.000]  The left heralded it, you know, as a viral protest song,
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:41.920]  power to the people.
[03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:44.760]  You could go on Twitter at any moment
[03:13:44.760 --> 03:13:47.200]  and find hundreds and thousands of tweets
[03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:49.920]  of people threatening to assassinate Trump.
[03:13:49.920 --> 03:13:52.160]  This is all while the mainstream media narrative
[03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:55.480]  was Trump is responsible for all the violence.
[03:13:55.480 --> 03:13:57.520]  As soon as it happens one time
[03:13:57.520 --> 03:13:59.800]  against mainstream Democrats,
[03:13:59.800 --> 03:14:02.320]  now they're all starting to freak out.
[03:14:02.320 --> 03:14:05.840]  Well, we've been telling you about it for months and months.
[03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:09.440]  Have you been living under a frigging rock?
[03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:12.040]  So now that Trump has basically banquished his,
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:13.560]  you know, competition,
[03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:16.720]  the Bernie Sanders radicals are turning their anger
[03:14:16.720 --> 03:14:18.440]  towards Hillary Clinton,
[03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:23.240]  and only now will the mainstream media recognize it.
[03:14:23.240 --> 03:14:26.400]  Because it was very useful to take those actions
[03:14:26.400 --> 03:14:28.360]  of the violent Bernie Sanders supporters
[03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:29.880]  and blame them on Trump
[03:14:29.880 --> 03:14:31.440]  when they were trying to sink Trump
[03:14:31.440 --> 03:14:34.680]  and prevent him from getting the Republican nomination.
[03:14:34.680 --> 03:14:37.480]  Now that's a foregone conclusion.
[03:14:37.480 --> 03:14:39.320]  The Bernie bots are turning their eye
[03:14:39.320 --> 03:14:41.000]  towards Hillary Clinton,
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:44.680]  and only now is the mainstream media worried about it.
[03:14:44.680 --> 03:14:47.760]  And as Crowder points out in his article today,
[03:14:47.760 --> 03:14:49.600]  the violence of Bernie Sanders supporters
[03:14:49.600 --> 03:14:51.800]  comes from Bernie himself.
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:53.760]  And he quotes talking points memo,
[03:14:53.760 --> 03:14:57.400]  who basically point out that over the past few weeks,
[03:14:57.400 --> 03:15:00.080]  the control, the direct control of the tone
[03:15:00.080 --> 03:15:02.680]  and the rhetoric of the Bernie Sanders campaign
[03:15:02.680 --> 03:15:06.960]  has been taken away from his close sides and advisors
[03:15:06.960 --> 03:15:09.520]  and handed over to Bernie himself.
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:10.720]  Which is why it's interesting
[03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:14.040]  that in the aftermath of this violence in Nevada,
[03:15:14.040 --> 03:15:17.760]  he refused to take any responsibility for it.
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:19.760]  So that's a deliberate action.
[03:15:19.760 --> 03:15:21.560]  He's refusing to take responsibility
[03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:24.280]  for the violence of his own supporters,
[03:15:24.280 --> 03:15:27.760]  again, which has been ongoing for months.
[03:15:27.760 --> 03:15:30.360]  Yet it's suddenly a major shock discovery
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:32.200]  for everyone in the mainstream media
[03:15:32.200 --> 03:15:35.080]  and the democratic political establishment.
[03:15:35.080 --> 03:15:37.840]  DC Whispers is reporting,
[03:15:37.840 --> 03:15:40.120]  and you've seen the pictures of Bill Clinton.
[03:15:40.120 --> 03:15:43.120]  Talk about Hillary Clinton and her coughing fits.
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:46.800]  Well, Bill doesn't look in too good shape either.
[03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:48.760]  Now they're speculating that he's suffering
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:51.760]  from some kind of neurological disorder
[03:15:51.760 --> 03:15:53.120]  and that that's becoming evident
[03:15:53.120 --> 03:15:54.800]  with his physical appearance.
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:56.040]  So watch out for that.
[03:15:56.040 --> 03:15:58.120]  Not only Hillary, but now Bill Clinton
[03:15:58.120 --> 03:16:01.120]  looks like he could be on the wane.
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:03.760]  But also Trump campaign supervisor, Paul Manafort,
[03:16:03.760 --> 03:16:07.200]  is said to be working with others on a comprehensive effort
[03:16:07.200 --> 03:16:10.080]  that includes the participation of multiple women
[03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:14.240]  from Bill and Hillary Clinton's past, of which there are many,
[03:16:14.240 --> 03:16:16.200]  that will decimate Hillary Clinton's
[03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:18.080]  off-repeated attempts to portray herself
[03:16:18.080 --> 03:16:21.000]  as a champion of women.
[03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:22.320]  The feminist candidate, again,
[03:16:22.320 --> 03:16:24.600]  just because she has a vagina.
[03:16:24.600 --> 03:16:26.640]  The launch for this effort is to take place
[03:16:26.640 --> 03:16:28.760]  around the same time as the Democratic Party Convention
[03:16:28.760 --> 03:16:32.720]  in late July and continue right up to election day.
[03:16:32.720 --> 03:16:35.320]  So apparently they're lining up these women
[03:16:35.320 --> 03:16:37.760]  who, of course, have been sexually assaulted
[03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:41.520]  by Bill Clinton and then silenced by the Hillary Clinton
[03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:44.440]  machine, and they're set to roll them out
[03:16:44.440 --> 03:16:48.720]  immediately before the convention in July.
[03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:51.440]  So obviously we knew that was coming to some extent,
[03:16:51.440 --> 03:16:54.280]  but it seems that some of the revelations coming
[03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:57.880]  from these women, these Bill Clinton sex assault victims,
[03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:01.800]  may not be just rehashing old material.
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:05.360]  It looks like from this they might have some new revelations
[03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:08.120]  that are certainly going to prove very damaging
[03:17:08.120 --> 03:17:09.920]  to Hillary Clinton.
[03:17:09.920 --> 03:17:13.000]  And of course, the polls, a hypothetical matchup
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:18.040]  between Clinton and Trump, back three, four weeks ago,
[03:17:18.040 --> 03:17:20.640]  a couple of months ago, there was a huge disparity
[03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:22.120]  between Clinton and Trump.
[03:17:22.120 --> 03:17:23.920]  She was clearly in the lead.
[03:17:23.920 --> 03:17:27.720]  Well, yet another story about how that gap is narrowing.
[03:17:27.720 --> 03:17:30.440]  This is out of WBUR.
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:32.440]  If the presidential election were held today
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:34.640]  between the apparent Republican nominee, Donald Trump,
[03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:36.920]  and the Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton,
[03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:39.160]  the outcome would be very close.
[03:17:39.160 --> 03:17:41.200]  This is a poll out of New Hampshire,
[03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:45.880]  which shows that Clinton leads Trump 44% to 42%
[03:17:45.880 --> 03:17:49.040]  with about 7% still undecided.
[03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:50.680]  Now, of course, we had the Rasmussen poll
[03:17:50.680 --> 03:17:52.640]  back a couple of weeks ago, which, of course,
[03:17:52.640 --> 03:17:55.160]  found that Trump was slightly ahead.
[03:17:55.160 --> 03:17:57.400]  So again, a huge shift.
[03:17:57.400 --> 03:18:00.320]  That prediction from the political scientist
[03:18:00.320 --> 03:18:02.440]  that we featured a few months ago, which was basically
[03:18:02.440 --> 03:18:05.440]  laughed at, where he said that Trump would crush
[03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:07.200]  Hillary in a landslide.
[03:18:07.200 --> 03:18:08.920]  Well, I don't know if that's going to happen,
[03:18:08.920 --> 03:18:12.240]  but it certainly looks like he's got the momentum.
[03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:15.960]  And remember, when Anne Coulter went on Bill Maher,
[03:18:15.960 --> 03:18:18.960]  and she said, and this was back in August, I believe,
[03:18:18.960 --> 03:18:21.360]  last summer anyway, that Donald Trump
[03:18:21.360 --> 03:18:23.320]  would be the Republican nominee.
[03:18:23.320 --> 03:18:26.680]  And of course, the crowd howled with laughter.
[03:18:26.680 --> 03:18:28.480]  Well, that was proven correct.
[03:18:28.480 --> 03:18:31.680]  Now, that huge disparity between Clinton and Trump
[03:18:31.680 --> 03:18:37.520]  in the polls is narrowing, it seems, with every new poll.
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:41.000]  Then, of course, you've got the neocons on the right.
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.440]  Bill Crystal, Glenn Beck.
[03:18:43.440 --> 03:18:45.760]  Bill Crystal's never-Trump renegade party
[03:18:45.760 --> 03:18:49.120]  has only 2,700 followers in 20 hours.
[03:18:49.120 --> 03:18:52.400]  Bill Crystal and the GOP elites are hurting.
[03:18:52.400 --> 03:18:55.480]  On Monday, never-Trump, Bill Crystal went on Newsmax TV
[03:18:55.480 --> 03:18:58.600]  and announced he was naming his anti-Trump protest party,
[03:18:58.600 --> 03:19:00.000]  the renegade party.
[03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:03.440]  And of course, all this will do is take votes away from Trump
[03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:06.480]  and ensure Hillary Clinton's victory.
[03:19:06.480 --> 03:19:09.280]  Obviously, Republican elites want a candidate that's pro-amnesty,
[03:19:09.280 --> 03:19:11.720]  pro-trans-Pacific trade agreement and anti-Trump.
[03:19:11.720 --> 03:19:14.160]  The voters want Trump, the elites don't.
[03:19:14.160 --> 03:19:19.680]  So Bill Crystal launched this massive never-Trump campaign
[03:19:19.680 --> 03:19:23.200]  to coalesce support behind the anti-Trump movement
[03:19:23.200 --> 03:19:26.120]  from mainstream conservatives.
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:28.400]  Basically, hasn't got off to a great start.
[03:19:28.400 --> 03:19:33.120]  As I speak, they've got around 3,000 followers on Twitter.
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:36.760]  Not quite the impact they would have expected.
[03:19:36.760 --> 03:19:39.800]  Coming up after the break, we're going to get into the Brexit,
[03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:41.920]  the vote on Britain leaving the EU,
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:43.800]  which is set to take place here.
[03:19:43.800 --> 03:19:44.960]  In around a month's time,
[03:19:44.960 --> 03:19:48.760]  there's an excellent new documentary out called Brexit the Movie.
[03:19:48.760 --> 03:19:51.040]  And we're going to play a few clips from that
[03:19:51.040 --> 03:19:53.400]  and talk about why this is fundamental
[03:19:53.400 --> 03:19:55.920]  to defeating the globalist agenda.
[03:19:55.920 --> 03:19:58.640]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones show. Stay tuned.
[03:19:58.640 --> 03:20:06.320]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a select quote agent with a true story
[03:20:06.320 --> 03:20:10.400]  of how select quote goes to bat for you by term life insurance.
[03:20:10.400 --> 03:20:14.000]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:15.960]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote
[03:20:15.960 --> 03:20:18.360]  another life insurance agent had given him.
[03:20:18.360 --> 03:20:20.240]  I said, let me see.
[03:20:20.240 --> 03:20:22.200]  Well, I took his pertinent information,
[03:20:22.200 --> 03:20:25.240]  then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies
[03:20:25.240 --> 03:20:28.200]  we represent and found one who pre-approved him
[03:20:28.200 --> 03:20:31.320]  for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[03:20:31.320 --> 03:20:33.640]  When it comes to term life insurance,
[03:20:33.640 --> 03:20:35.720]  no other company touches select quotes,
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:40.000]  experience and expertise in finding the right policy
[03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:43.360]  at the right price for almost anyone.
[03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:44.360]  How about you?

[03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:37.680]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing

[03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:08.200]  At best, your local stores have a three-day supply of food.
[03:22:08.200 --> 03:22:10.520]  Will your family have to fight over what's left?
[03:22:10.520 --> 03:22:12.800]  Are you willing to gamble your family's safety
[03:22:12.800 --> 03:22:14.280]  that it'll never happen to you?

[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:03.400]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain,
[03:23:03.400 --> 03:23:07.040]  blood pressure, cholesterol, or irregular heartbeat?
[03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:09.200]  Are you looking for a more natural solution
[03:23:09.200 --> 03:23:11.440]  to overcome these health challenges?
[03:23:11.440 --> 03:23:13.360]  You hear the ads all the time.
[03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:16.920]  If this stuff's so good, why doesn't my doctor prescribe it?
[03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:17.840]  That's easy.

[03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:19.000]  Stand up for your right.
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:20.000]  We are back.
[03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:22.000]  It's the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones show.
[03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  We're going to get to those Brexit the movie clips
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:26.000]  in the next segment.
[03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  This is a key documentary that's been released
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000]  in full online for free.
[03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:34.000]  Anyone can go and watch it just about a month
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:37.000]  before the big Brexit vote in the UK.
[03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:39.000]  Now, of course, that doesn't apply to Americans
[03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:41.000]  who can't vote in that, but it's key
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:44.000]  to get this documentary out to reach people
[03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:47.000]  in Britain who can, because the campaign
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:50.000]  around the remain votes, which, of course,
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:54.000]  has been supported and cheerleaded by the Prime Minister,
[03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:59.000]  David Cameron, has been based on nothing but pure fear.
[03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:02.000]  The appeal to irrational emotion and panic,
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  the threat of World War III, if God forbid,
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:08.000]  Britain was to leave this disastrous trade zone
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  known as the EU.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000]  Yesterday, we had him saying that, you know,
[03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:16.000]  ISIS would support Britain exiting the EU.
[03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  What's next?
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  Are they going to get Satan to put out a press release
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  saying that he also supports Britain leaving the EU?
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  That's why they call it project fear.
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:26.000]  They've got no facts.
[03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  They've got no logic.
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  They've got no history.
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:31.000]  All they've got is that irrational appeal
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000]  to panic and emotion.
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:35.000]  So we're going to get into that after the break.
[03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:39.000]  We're going to play a few clips from that big documentary.
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  Now, Italy, a couple of days ago,
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  came out and basically followed the lead of Russia
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  and was begging their population to have children
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000]  because they're currently experiencing
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  a demographic meltdown.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  And now the Pope has come out and said
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:56.000]  that Muslims must breed with Europeans.
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:59.000]  This is up on infowars.com in a shocking interview.
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:02.000]  Pope Francis likened Jesus Christ to ISIS
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:04.000]  and said Muslim migrants must breed
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  with the Europeans to counter declining birth rates.
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:10.000]  Today, I don't think there is a fear of Islam as such,
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:12.000]  but of ISIS and its war of conquest,
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:14.000]  which is partly drawn from Islam.
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  He told a French newspaper,
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:18.000]  it is true that the idea of conquest
[03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  is inherent in the soul of Islam.
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:24.000]  Well, read the Quran, it's there in black and white.
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:26.000]  However, it is also impossible to interpret
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:28.000]  the objective in Matthew's Gospel,
[03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  where Jesus sends his disciples to all nations
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  in terms of the same idea of conquest.
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:37.000]  I don't recall Jesus sending out his disciples
[03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:39.000]  to behead everyone,
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:42.000]  to force them to pay the jizya, the tax,
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  if they refuse to convert to Islam,
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:48.000]  basically driving them from their lands via force.
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  I don't think there is quite a comparison there.
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  But he also said,
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  he headed hearing about the Christian roots of Europe
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:58.000]  because to him they take on colonialist overtones.
[03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  Yeah, defending Europe from hordes of Muslim invaders.
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:05.000]  That's colonialism, apparently.
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000]  And he called on European nations
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  to integrate Muslim migrants into the continent.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:11.000]  Listen to this.
[03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  This integration is all the more necessary today
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:16.000]  since as a result of selfish search for well-being,
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  Europe is experiencing the grave problem of declining birth rate.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:23.000]  Yeah, we're not having 9, 10 children like Muslims do.
[03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:25.000]  That's really selfish.
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:29.000]  A demographic emptiness is developing, the Pope said.
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  So he basically said that
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000]  we need to accept the Muslim migrants
[03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  because then they can breed with Europeans
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:38.000]  and save us from that demographic disaster.
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:41.000]  Which of course will result in a lot less,
[03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:44.000]  not just white people, but Catholics in general.
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  So he's comparing Jesus Christ with ISIS
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  and he's calling for the conquest of Europe
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000]  via Muslim interbreeding,
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.000]  which is exactly the same thing that
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.000]  Sheikh Mohammed Ayed,
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  and we featured this video clip numerous times,
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:02.000]  called for at a Jerusalem mosque.
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:05.000]  And the quote again is in the article
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:08.000]  from this top sheik who got up and said,
[03:28:08.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  quote, Europe has become old and decrepit
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:13.000]  and needs human reinforcement.
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:16.000]  They are not motivated by compassion for the Levant,
[03:28:16.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  it's people and it's refugees.
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:20.000]  Soon we will trample them under thought,
[03:28:20.000 --> 03:28:22.000]  a la willing.
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:24.000]  Throughout Europe, all the hearts are enthused
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:26.000]  with hatred towards Muslims.
[03:28:26.000 --> 03:28:29.000]  They wish that we were dead, but they have lost their fertility.
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:32.000]  So they look for fertility in our midst.
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  We will give them fertility.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  We will breed children with them
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:40.000]  so that was a top imam in Jerusalem
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  and now the Pope is basically mirroring his rhetoric.
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  Absolutely astounding quotes.
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:49.000]  You can go and read them on infowars.com.
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  Sky News reports interpol 800,000 migrants
[03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  ready to head to EU.
[03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:57.000]  An estimate to the 100,000 migrants
[03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.000]  are waiting in Libya to cross into Europe
[03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.000]  and there is an increased possibility
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000]  that terrorists will try to cross with them
[03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:05.000]  a report by interpol and Europol says.
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.000]  So they basically came out and said,
[03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:09.000]  yeah, there's a small chance that terrorists
[03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:12.000]  might infiltrate these millions of migrants.
[03:29:12.000 --> 03:29:14.000]  Oh really, do you think?
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:18.000]  Given that the mastermind of the frigging Paris massacre
[03:29:18.000 --> 03:29:22.000]  brazenly gloated about the fact that he and his cohorts
[03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:24.000]  were able to get into Europe
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:27.000]  by exploiting the migrant wave.
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:30.000]  So now you've got Sky News basically reporting
[03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:34.000]  that we're expecting 800,000 to come in
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:36.000]  over the next 12 months,
[03:29:36.000 --> 03:29:38.000]  given the warm summer weather.
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:40.000]  That influx is only going to accelerate.
[03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:42.000]  We'll get more into it after the break
[03:29:42.000 --> 03:29:44.000]  and we'll play those clips from Brexit.
[03:29:44.000 --> 03:30:05.000]  This is the Alex Jones show live, stay tuned.
[03:30:14.000 --> 03:30:18.000]  The White Guy Smile
[03:30:18.000 --> 03:30:20.000]  While agonizing over whether or not
[03:30:20.000 --> 03:30:22.000]  a white person smiling at a black person
[03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:25.000]  is a racist microaggression.
[03:30:25.000 --> 03:30:27.000]  There's all of this stuff wrapped up
[03:30:27.000 --> 03:30:30.000]  in how we meet or do not meet each other's eyes.
[03:30:30.000 --> 03:30:32.000]  Another white female student then discusses
[03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:34.000]  how her black relatives will always talk
[03:30:34.000 --> 03:30:36.000]  about the White Guy Smile.
[03:30:36.000 --> 03:30:38.000]  What are you supposed to do?
[03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:40.000]  I smile at everybody but then somehow
[03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:42.000]  I'm conscious of that and then I just
[03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:44.000]  smile. As much as I don't think of myself
[03:30:44.000 --> 03:30:46.000]  as having that awkwardness, there's always that.
[03:30:46.000 --> 03:30:48.000]  Am I doing the White Guy Smile
[03:30:48.000 --> 03:30:50.000]  or is it that normal smile? She asks.
[03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:52.000]  Laughing at liberals sums up the sheer idiocy
[03:30:52.000 --> 03:30:54.000]  of this exchange.
[03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:56.000]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infobores.com
[03:30:56.000 --> 03:31:00.000]  reporting on the idiocy of America.
[03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:02.000]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic
[03:31:02.000 --> 03:31:04.000]  form of chivalry.
[03:31:04.000 --> 03:31:06.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[03:31:06.000 --> 03:31:08.000]  giving the warriors of the tribe
[03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:11.000]  a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:31:11.000 --> 03:31:13.000]  Sixty years ago,
[03:31:13.000 --> 03:31:15.000]  when foreign air forces were approaching
[03:31:15.000 --> 03:31:17.000]  filled with bombs,
[03:31:17.000 --> 03:31:19.000]  they had drums of their own,
[03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:21.000]  air raid sirens.
[03:31:21.000 --> 03:31:23.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent
[03:31:23.000 --> 03:31:25.000]  weapons for quiet war.
[03:31:25.000 --> 03:31:27.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water,
[03:31:27.000 --> 03:31:29.000]  to the lining of plastics that destroy
[03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:31.000]  our vitality, turn off our hormones
[03:31:31.000 --> 03:31:33.000]  and accelerate our journey
[03:31:33.000 --> 03:31:35.000]  towards death. I personally
[03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:37.000]  counter this onslaught with antroplex.
[03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:39.000]  Antroplex is
[03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:41.000]  designed with known, organic,
[03:31:41.000 --> 03:31:43.000]  concentrated herbs
[03:31:43.000 --> 03:31:45.000]  to create the basic foundation
[03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:47.000]  to normal metabolic activity
[03:31:47.000 --> 03:31:49.000]  inside the human body.
[03:31:49.000 --> 03:31:51.000]  Discover why antroplex has turned so many heads today.
[03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:53.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies
[03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:55.000]  back into our own hands,
[03:31:55.000 --> 03:31:57.000]  and it starts at infoboreslife.com
[03:31:57.000 --> 03:32:10.000]  for more information on antroplex.
[03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:31.000]  On the web at
[03:32:31.000 --> 03:32:33.000]  infoboresteam.com,
[03:32:33.000 --> 03:33:01.000]  that's infoboresteam.com.
[03:33:01.000 --> 03:33:04.000]  Crashing through the lies
[03:33:04.000 --> 03:33:06.000]  and disinformation,
[03:33:06.000 --> 03:33:08.000]  it's Alex Jones
[03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:11.000]  on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:11.000 --> 03:33:32.000]  We are back. It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  We're going to play some of these clips from
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:36.000]  Brexit the Movie. This was the big documentary
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:38.000]  that came out here last week.
[03:33:38.000 --> 03:33:40.000]  It's featured in some cinemas.
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:42.000]  Now, the rhetoric, the back and forth between
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:44.000]  people like Boris Johnson,
[03:33:44.000 --> 03:33:46.000]  the former mayor of London,
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:48.000]  who is supporting the Leave campaign,
[03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:50.000]  and, of course, David Cameron,
[03:33:50.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  the prime minister, who's supporting the Remain campaign,
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:55.000]  has heated up in recent days.
[03:33:55.000 --> 03:33:57.000]  Boris came out
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:33:59.000]  back around four or five days ago
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:01.000]  and said, basically, the EU
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  was an attempt to create
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:05.000]  what Hitler tried to create
[03:34:05.000 --> 03:34:07.000]  after World War II.
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:09.000]  He was immediately lambasted
[03:34:09.000 --> 03:34:11.000]  as being hyperbolic,
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:13.000]  because, of course,
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:15.000]  David Cameron threatening World War III
[03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:17.000]  if Britain was to leave the EU
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:19.000]  is not hyperbolic at all.
[03:34:19.000 --> 03:34:21.000]  So, basically, Donald Tusk,
[03:34:21.000 --> 03:34:23.000]  the European Council president,
[03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:25.000]  another unelected tyrannical
[03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:27.000]  bureaucrat came out and said
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:29.000]  that he had crossed the boundaries
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:31.000]  by making such a comparison.
[03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:33.000]  Pro Remain campaigner Lord Heseltine,
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:35.000]  he, of course, lobbied
[03:34:35.000 --> 03:34:37.000]  for the introduction for Britain
[03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:39.000]  to join the EU in the first place,
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:41.000]  the free trade zone,
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:43.000]  labelled Johnson's remarks
[03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:45.000]  preposterous on our scene.
[03:34:45.000 --> 03:34:47.000]  How dare Boris Johnson
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  even make this comparison?
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:51.000]  Well, the comparison is completely accurate.
[03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:53.000]  And, in fact, I wrote about this
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:55.000]  probably seven years ago.
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:34:57.000]  Dug up the quotes where you had
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:34:59.000]  top Nazis,
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:01.000]  Nazi economics minister Walter Funk,
[03:35:01.000 --> 03:35:03.000]  Nazi academic Heinrich Honka,
[03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:05.000]  Nazi Gustav Konig,
[03:35:05.000 --> 03:35:07.000]  all of them.
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  And you can read the quotes in this article.
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:11.000]  Boris is completely right.
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:13.000]  The EU was a Nazi brainchild.
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:15.000]  They call for the exact same system,
[03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:17.000]  a European federal
[03:35:17.000 --> 03:35:19.000]  superstate that was then set up
[03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:21.000]  under the EU.
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:23.000]  Minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:25.000]  ordered the creation
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:27.000]  of the large-scale economic unification
[03:35:27.000 --> 03:35:29.000]  of Europe believing that in 50 years
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:31.000]  time, people no longer
[03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  think in terms of countries.
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:35.000]  Quote,
[03:35:35.000 --> 03:35:37.000]  that's exactly what the EU has
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  become.
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:41.000]  So let's roll some of these clips from Brexit
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:43.000]  in the movie. Here's Kafka's
[03:35:43.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  EU. Let's go to the clip.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:47.000]  Exactly how the functions
[03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:49.000]  of the British constitution work,
[03:35:49.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  but they get the gist of it. Once every five years
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:53.000]  we go down the school hall
[03:35:53.000 --> 03:35:55.000]  or to a church, we put a cross in a ballot paper,
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  they're all counted up and the chat
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:35:59.000]  with the most votes wins. We get that.
[03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:01.000]  You try
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:03.000]  working out how a European commissioner
[03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:05.000]  is appointed.
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:07.000]  It's positively Kafka-esque.
[03:36:07.000 --> 03:36:09.000]  You can't actually get your head around
[03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:11.000]  who does what, why, and who is
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:13.000]  responsible to whom. The European Union,
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:15.000]  which imposes laws on 28 countries,
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:17.000]  is made up of seven main institutions,
[03:36:17.000 --> 03:36:19.000]  which include the European Council,
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:21.000]  the Council of the European Union,
[03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  the Court of Justice of the European Union,
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:25.000]  the European Commission,
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:27.000]  and the European Parliament.
[03:36:27.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  Do you know the difference between
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:31.000]  the European Council,
[03:36:31.000 --> 03:36:33.000]  the Council of the European Union,
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:35.000]  and the Council of Europe?
[03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:37.000]  It's a very good question.
[03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:43.000]  Tell me how many presidents there are
[03:36:43.000 --> 03:36:45.000]  in the European Union. How many presidents?
[03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:47.000]  I'd guess at one. There's two presidents,
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:49.000]  for goodness' sake. I don't know what
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:51.000]  the difference between the two presidents is.
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:36:53.000]  There's four presidents, you say.
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:55.000]  There are squads of committees
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:36:57.000]  and presidents of this and commissioners of that.
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:59.000]  What I really hate is
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:01.000]  pooled sovereignty.
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:03.000]  It's bollocks. The people of Slovenia
[03:37:03.000 --> 03:37:05.000]  have no more idea than the people of the UK
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:07.000]  and the people of Sweden
[03:37:07.000 --> 03:37:09.000]  or the people of Spain
[03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:11.000]  what, in fact, is going on.
[03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:13.000]  I wouldn't profess to understand
[03:37:13.000 --> 03:37:15.000]  the detail of how it all works,
[03:37:15.000 --> 03:37:17.000]  and I think part of that is deliberate.
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:19.000]  One side knows. One side is a priesthood,
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:21.000]  and knows how it all works.
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:23.000]  And the rest of us ordinary citizens
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:25.000]  don't know how it works.
[03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  The massive transfer of power takes place.
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:29.000]  It was devised
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:31.000]  to make sure that the great
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  mass of the people could not control
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:35.000]  government
[03:37:35.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  ever again.
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  So this is a bureaucracy
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:41.000]  where we don't even
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:43.000]  have the power to remove
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:45.000]  the people who govern us. If that's
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:47.000]  not pure tyranny,
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:49.000]  then I don't know what is. Why would we
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:51.000]  want to hand power for the future
[03:37:51.000 --> 03:37:53.000]  of our country over to people
[03:37:53.000 --> 03:37:55.000]  who are not accountable to anyone?
[03:37:55.000 --> 03:37:57.000]  They're not responsible for their own
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:37:59.000]  decisions. What kind of terrible
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:01.000]  idea is that?
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:03.000]  Moving on to the economy, because there's another clip
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:05.000]  in this movie where they basically
[03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:07.000]  visit some of the fishing
[03:38:07.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  ports in Northern England
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:11.000]  to illustrate the fact that the EU
[03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:13.000]  has completely decimated
[03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:15.000]  the British fishing industry.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:17.000]  Fishermen are not allowed
[03:38:17.000 --> 03:38:19.000]  to fish right on their own
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:21.000]  doorstep, because, of course,
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:23.000]  they handed over fishing rights to the EU
[03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:25.000]  who carved it all up
[03:38:25.000 --> 03:38:27.000]  and gave rights to countries
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:29.000]  like the Netherlands, Norway,
[03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:31.000]  to fish three miles offshore
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  in some cases from
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:35.000]  British territory.
[03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:37.000]  So these fish markets, whereas in the past
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:39.000]  you would have, you know, 12,000
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:41.000]  boxes full,
[03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:43.000]  teaming of fish laid out in these markets
[03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:45.000]  a day,
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:47.000]  every single day, now it's
[03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:49.000]  200, and they illustrate
[03:38:49.000 --> 03:38:51.000]  that in the movie. Again,
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:53.000]  it put a lot of companies out of business,
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:55.000]  it put a lot of fishermen out of business,
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  and now we have to import
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:38:59.000]  fish from other countries,
[03:38:59.000 --> 03:39:01.000]  because we're not allowed to fish
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:03.000]  in our own waters.
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:05.000]  And in fact, the EU pays fishermen
[03:39:05.000 --> 03:39:07.000]  to destroy their own boats,
[03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:09.000]  and of course, when it comes down to the
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:11.000]  consumer level, we have to pay
[03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:13.000]  more, because we're not allowed
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:15.000]  to catch our own food.
[03:39:15.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  Let's go to this next clip, which is
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:19.000]  about the economy. This is crony capitalism
[03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:47.000]  and the EU. Here's the clip.
[03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:51.000]  One of the first things that stuns you
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:53.000]  are the number of invitations on your desk
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:55.000]  to lunch, breakfast, dinner, champagne
[03:39:55.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  receptions, and invariably, they come from
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  lobby groups. There are people who make their
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:01.000]  entire livelihoods out of
[03:40:01.000 --> 03:40:03.000]  being professional lobbyists in Brussels.
[03:40:03.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  This is where a lot of the lobbying goes on,
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:07.000]  so you will see the lobbyists from
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:09.000]  different companies, from NGOs.
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:11.000]  The returns they get by
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:13.000]  stifling competition and
[03:40:13.000 --> 03:40:15.000]  framing regulations in a way which suits them
[03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:17.000]  and keeps other people out is very, very
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:19.000]  striking. It used to be called the Rich
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.000]  Man's Club, and that
[03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:23.000]  is by and large what it is.
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:25.000]  So
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:27.000]  again, these big businesses
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:29.000]  love the regulations that the
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:31.000]  EU imposes, because
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:33.000]  they can afford to put them in place without
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:35.000]  the bottom line taking too much of a hit.
[03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:37.000]  If you're a small or medium-sized
[03:40:37.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  business, you can't afford to do
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:41.000]  that. That's why big corporations
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:43.000]  love these regulations, because they
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:45.000]  can use them to strangle their
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:47.000]  competition.
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:49.000]  Despite the fact that only
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:51.000]  6% of their exports
[03:40:51.000 --> 03:40:53.000]  go to the EU,
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:55.000]  small businesses have to
[03:40:55.000 --> 03:40:57.000]  comply with 100%
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:40:59.000]  of the regulations handed down
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  by the EU.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:03.000]  Of course, big corporations can
[03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:05.000]  afford to hire people to do that behind
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:07.000]  the scenes. Small businesses
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:09.000]  can't, so they end up
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:11.000]  just either giving up entirely or not
[03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:13.000]  exporting to the EU,
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:15.000]  and of course then they get beat
[03:41:15.000 --> 03:41:17.000]  in terms of competition.
[03:41:17.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  That's why big business
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:21.000]  loves the EU. So in what way
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  does that represent
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  small businesses? In what way does that represent
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:27.000]  the interests of the middle class?
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:29.000]  It doesn't.
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:31.000]  Now here's the next clip, which gets into the
[03:41:31.000 --> 03:41:33.000]  regulations that the
[03:41:33.000 --> 03:41:35.000]  EU imposes. They've actually
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:37.000]  delayed. They've delayed banning
[03:41:37.000 --> 03:41:39.000]  quote, high-powered
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:41.000]  kettles, toasters,
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:43.000]  hairdryers and vacuum cleaners
[03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:45.000]  until after this vote
[03:41:45.000 --> 03:41:47.000]  takes place. Because they know if
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:49.000]  they did that beforehand,
[03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:51.000]  it would stoke the anger of the British people
[03:41:51.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  because it illustrates what
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:55.000]  level of micro-management
[03:41:55.000 --> 03:41:57.000]  and control that we are being forced
[03:41:57.000 --> 03:41:59.000]  to labour under
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:01.000]  by remaining in the EU.
[03:42:01.000 --> 03:42:03.000]  So here's the next clip,
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:05.000]  Regulated People.
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:07.000]  Let's roll it.
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:09.000]  You've got
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  thousands and thousands
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:13.000]  of bureaucrats, civil servants
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:15.000]  and administrators, and their job
[03:42:15.000 --> 03:42:17.000]  is to push paper,
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:19.000]  write on paper, have rules on paper,
[03:42:19.000 --> 03:42:21.000]  pile up more and more
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:23.000]  paper. You just get
[03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  a mass of growing
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:27.000]  telephone directory
[03:42:27.000 --> 03:42:29.000]  size rules and regulations
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:31.000]  one after the other,
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  ceaselessly, endlessly.
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:35.000]  That is actually what the bureaucracy sees
[03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:37.000]  itself as there to do.
[03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:41.000]  If the list of EU rules could
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  be put into one document today,
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:45.000]  it would take more than two men to carry
[03:42:45.000 --> 03:42:47.000]  it on. Such a document would reach
[03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:49.000]  as high as Nelson's column.
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  Regulation is so vast and complex,
[03:42:53.000 --> 03:42:55.000]  even the EU is unable to
[03:42:55.000 --> 03:42:57.000]  tell us how many laws there are
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:42:59.000]  covering different areas of our lives
[03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:01.000]  to review some helpful EU
[03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  databases to make the best estimate
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:05.000]  we can.
[03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  Here is regulated EU man
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:11.000]  waking from his regulated slumber
[03:43:11.000 --> 03:43:13.000]  to start his regulated day.
[03:43:13.000 --> 03:43:15.000]  You wouldn't think you'd need a law for
[03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:17.000]  pillar cases, but the EU has five.
[03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.000]  But that's nothing. The pillow inside
[03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  is subject to 109 different
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:23.000]  EU laws.
[03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:25.000]  As far as we can tell, there are only 11
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:27.000]  EU laws pertaining to radio alarm clocks.
[03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:29.000]  There's around 400
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:31.000]  governing the other staff on Joe's
[03:43:31.000 --> 03:43:33.000]  Nelson's bedside table.
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:35.000]  You can't be too careful
[03:43:35.000 --> 03:43:37.000]  with duvets and sheets, so there's
[03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:39.000]  around 50 laws governing those.
[03:43:39.000 --> 03:43:41.000]  There are 65 laws governing bathrooms,
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:43.000]  but that doesn't include the contents.
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:45.000]  How they manage to think up 31 laws
[03:43:45.000 --> 03:43:47.000]  for toothbrushes is beyond me.
[03:43:47.000 --> 03:43:49.000]  But let's face it, toothpaste is a bit
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  weird, so 47 laws sounds about right.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:53.000]  Mirrors have been known to crack
[03:43:53.000 --> 03:43:55.000]  and get dirty, so they're covered by
[03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  172 laws.
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:43:59.000]  As for the shower, well, we've all seen
[03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:01.000]  that before.
[03:44:01.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  Shampoos like that is now strictly prohibited.
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:05.000]  Shampoo can get in your eyes and cause
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:07.000]  discomfort, 118 laws.
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  EU bureaucrats seem terrified by towels
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:11.000]  for some reason, slightly more relaxed
[03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:13.000]  about radiators.
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:15.000]  There are 1,246 laws relating
[03:44:15.000 --> 03:44:17.000]  to bread, but just 52 covering
[03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:19.000]  the crazy anarchic toaster.
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:21.000]  Just 84 laws cover fridges.
[03:44:21.000 --> 03:44:23.000]  But an impressive 12,000
[03:44:23.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  laws cover milk.
[03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:27.000]  After all, it might go off.
[03:44:27.000 --> 03:44:29.000]  There are also laws.
[03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:31.000]  Spoon, more than 200 laws, same for the
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:33.000]  orange juice.
[03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  But the coffee, whoa, stand back,
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:37.000]  grandma, this toxic jungle juice
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:39.000]  can keep you up all night.
[03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:41.000]  The best dog in Britain is unaware
[03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:43.000]  of the odorless fog of canine
[03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:45.000]  legislation, but careful ruby
[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:47.000]  ignorance is no excuse.
[03:44:47.000 --> 03:44:49.000]  Our regulated man leaves
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:51.000]  his regulated house.
[03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  There are only 92 laws about pavements,
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:44:55.000]  after all, they're just pavements,
[03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:57.000]  and this regulation surrounds us like
[03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:59.000]  invisible barbed wire.
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:01.000]  When we're frustrated in our daily lives
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:03.000]  by needless, stupid EU laws, it's infuriating.
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:05.000]  But it's much worse than infuriating
[03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:07.000]  if you're thinking of starting a new business.
[03:45:07.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  It's like entering a legal
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:11.000]  minefield.
[03:45:11.000 --> 03:45:13.000]  For small and medium-sized businesses
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:15.000]  and start-ups, it's perilous.
[03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:17.000]  Complying with regulation imposes huge costs
[03:45:17.000 --> 03:45:19.000]  and falling foul of regulation
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:21.000]  can put you out of business.
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:23.000]  So again,
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:25.000]  crony capitalism, it's corporatism,
[03:45:25.000 --> 03:45:27.000]  it's the bureaucracy working
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:29.000]  hand-in-hand with big business
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:31.000]  to strangle out small business.
[03:45:31.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  Because they don't have the means,
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:35.000]  they don't have the time, they don't have the staff
[03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:37.000]  to comply with these hundreds
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  and hundreds
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:41.000]  for each individual
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:43.000]  thing. Towels, you saw there
[03:45:43.000 --> 03:45:45.000]  like 200 different regulations for towels,
[03:45:45.000 --> 03:45:47.000]  600 for coffee.
[03:45:47.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  They just don't have the time or means
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:51.000]  to comply with these regulations.
[03:45:51.000 --> 03:45:53.000]  So they either go out of business
[03:45:53.000 --> 03:45:55.000]  or they just have to
[03:45:55.000 --> 03:45:57.000]  constrict their trade to within the UK.
[03:45:57.000 --> 03:45:59.000]  They can't even trade with the EU.
[03:45:59.000 --> 03:46:01.000]  So what is in it for them
[03:46:01.000 --> 03:46:03.000]  and what is in it for us as consumers?
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:05.000]  And of course, what this has created
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:07.000]  is this anemic economic
[03:46:07.000 --> 03:46:09.000]  growth which pervades the EU,
[03:46:09.000 --> 03:46:11.000]  which in turn has led
[03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:13.000]  to mass uprisings
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  and civil unrest because people's
[03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:17.000]  quality of living is going down.
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:19.000]  The cost of living is going up
[03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  and now we see
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:23.000]  right-wing extremist parties
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:25.000]  springing up and saying that
[03:46:25.000 --> 03:46:27.000]  they have the solution, they have the answer.
[03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:29.000]  So it's fueling extremism on both
[03:46:29.000 --> 03:46:31.000]  sides. We've had mass riots
[03:46:31.000 --> 03:46:33.000]  for the past six, seven years.
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:35.000]  So how is it in our
[03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:37.000]  interests, how does it make us safe
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:39.000]  to stay in the EU
[03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  when these anemic economic
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:43.000]  policies are going to create more
[03:46:43.000 --> 03:46:45.000]  riots, more civil unrest? That's not
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:47.000]  safety. The vote
[03:46:47.000 --> 03:46:49.000]  campaign claims that we're only going to
[03:46:49.000 --> 03:46:51.000]  maintain our safety and avoid
[03:46:51.000 --> 03:46:53.000]  World War III if we
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:55.000]  stay in this bureaucratic
[03:46:55.000 --> 03:46:57.000]  mess. Again, it's
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:46:59.000]  complete BS. Let's go to the
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:47:01.000]  final clip which sums up
[03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:03.000]  why Britain needs to leave the EU.
[03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:17.000]  Here's the clip.
[03:47:33.000 --> 03:47:35.000]  It's to hand over every year
[03:47:35.000 --> 03:47:37.000]  more money and more power
[03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:39.000]  to an unaccountable bureaucratic elite
[03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:41.000]  in Brussels than what they should do
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:43.000]  is campaign to stay in the European Union.
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  It comes down to the essential issue
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  the working man and woman of this
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:49.000]  country against people
[03:47:49.000 --> 03:47:51.000]  who think
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  we have a better plan and a better
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:55.000]  mind than you.
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:47:57.000]  And if you don't like it
[03:47:57.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  what are you going to do?
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  And the answer is
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  we're going to vote leave.
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:05.000]  So
[03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  there are a number of issues
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:09.000]  where I believe that we should be
[03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:11.000]  leaving.
[03:48:11.000 --> 03:48:13.000]  This is people versus the establishment
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:15.000]  people versus the elite.
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:17.000]  I just hope that the
[03:48:17.000 --> 03:48:19.000]  mass of people who may not go around
[03:48:19.000 --> 03:48:21.000]  being interviewed much may never get
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:23.000]  a look in on any of the media or television
[03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:25.000]  come June the 23rd will be out
[03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:27.000]  there saying this is our chance
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:29.000]  to get our own back.
[03:48:29.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  Give us back control
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:33.000]  of our own country.
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:35.000]  With general elections it doesn't really matter
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:37.000]  who you vote for, conservative or Labour
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:39.000]  because you know that in four years time
[03:48:39.000 --> 03:48:41.000]  you can change your mind.
[03:48:41.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  This time you can't change your mind.
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:45.000]  This time is for keeps.
[03:48:45.000 --> 03:48:47.000]  This referendum is the most important
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:49.000]  political act
[03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:51.000]  that has happened in my lifetime.
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:53.000]  This is about
[03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:55.000]  our future,
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:57.000]  our freedom, our democracy
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:48:59.000]  our right to govern ourselves.
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:01.000]  What really matters is that you should
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  have the power to remove the people
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  who govern you. The reason why the suffragettes
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:07.000]  went to all that trouble
[03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:09.000]  to get the vote was because they
[03:49:09.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  wanted to they themselves
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:13.000]  be treated as grownups and decide their
[03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:15.000]  own destiny. If I was told
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:17.000]  I would be stewing grass to feed
[03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  my family in five years time
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  if we left the European Union I would still
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:23.000]  do it. It's time to
[03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:25.000]  regain our freedom and independence.
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:27.000]  The right to decide ourselves
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:29.000]  how we live our lives.
[03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:31.000]  There's a lot at stake here.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:33.000]  What we want is democracy.
[03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  We the people should
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:37.000]  determine our own destiny.
[03:49:37.000 --> 03:49:39.000]  We have the capacity to shape
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:41.000]  our own futures. So my question
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:43.000]  is what price
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:45.000]  freedom?
[03:49:45.000 --> 03:49:47.000]  That's Brexit the movie which
[03:49:47.000 --> 03:49:49.000]  came out here last week
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:51.000]  and it's free on YouTube, it's free on Vimeo.
[03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:53.000]  I posted it on my Twitter page
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:55.000]  yesterday so of course
[03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  most of the listeners here are American
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:49:59.000]  they're not going to vote in the EU referendum
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:01.000]  I'm well aware of that but you can
[03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  reach many people. I think it's up to
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:05.000]  about 250,000 views on
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:07.000]  YouTube at this point which quite
[03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:09.000]  frankly is not enough. We need to get
[03:50:09.000 --> 03:50:11.000]  millions and millions of views for that video
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:13.000]  because people
[03:50:13.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  in the United Kingdom are out there they're looking
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:17.000]  for answers they're not getting accurate
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:19.000]  unbiased sources
[03:50:19.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  of information and of course
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:23.000]  that's vehemently pro-leave but
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:25.000]  again they cite facts
[03:50:25.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  statistics, history
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:29.000]  and logic. They don't pander
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  to irrational fear in emotion
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  like the Remain campaign does
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:35.000]  by threatening World War 3
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:37.000]  if Britain leaves the EU
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:39.000]  you know insulting people's intelligence
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:41.000]  to such a degree that they think
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:43.000]  they don't know the difference
[03:50:43.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  between NATO and the EU
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:47.000]  as David Cameron has done
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:49.000]  you know saying that ISIS would support
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  us leaving. Completely ridiculous
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:53.000]  fear-based emotional manipulation
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  we'll be back with the final segment
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:51:21.000]  of the Alex Sherm Show Overdrive. Stay right there.
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  Let's join them at 42. What did I do?
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:29.000]  I took a 7 herb formula
[03:51:29.000 --> 03:51:31.000]  I now call Extendivite made from garlic
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:33.000]  cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba,
[03:51:33.000 --> 03:51:35.000]  hawthorn, milk thistle and valerian.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:37.000]  Based on German studies of natural medicine
[03:51:37.000 --> 03:51:39.000]  Extendivite is designed to clear
[03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:41.000]  block arteries, clean the toxins from your
[03:51:41.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  blood and improve your immune system
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:45.000]  to get your Extendivite call
[03:51:45.000 --> 03:51:47.000]  1-877-928-8822
[03:51:47.000 --> 03:51:49.000]  that's 1-877-928-8822

[03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:02.000]  My computer is so slow. It's making me crazy.
[03:53:02.000 --> 03:53:06.000]  I used to have that problem. Did you quit using the computer or did you buy a new one?
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:10.000]  Well, I called Geeks on site. They made an appointment to visit my home and showed up the same day.
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:13.000]  You mean they didn't ask you to bring your computer to a shop?
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:15.000]  That's what happened when I called a support company.
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:19.000]  Geeks on site can go to your home or business or even repair your computer online.
[03:53:19.000 --> 03:53:21.000]  They have 24-7 emergency service.

[03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:20.000]  We've got 20% off survival shield X2.
[03:54:20.000 --> 03:54:28.000]  Again, it's really important to support us so that you can fund our driver effort to challenge the mainstream media
[03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:36.000]  on all these key narrative battlegrounds, which we'll be doing at Bilderberg again next month.
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:42.000]  It's not cheap to fund all the hotels, all the flights, all the equipment to pay staff to go out there.
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:46.000]  So that's where your money goes. You've been really excellent in supporting us so far.
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  So please continue to do so by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:59.000]  Please read the independent reviews of legions of people who are very satisfied indeed with their products.
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  But we've only got a few minutes left, so we're going to go to these news stories now.
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:07.000]  Information and Liberation reports, quote, you're a German, you're nothing.
[03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:10.000]  Migrant filmed assaulting a bullying German teen.
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  So this is basically a racial attack.
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  Of course, it will get no mainstream media coverage whatsoever.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:22.000]  The German police are already probably busy covering it up like they did with the mass migrant molestation in Cologne.
[03:55:22.000 --> 03:55:28.000]  Basically, it was a young German teen being bullied, being shamed for being German by a Turkish migrant
[03:55:28.000 --> 03:55:33.000]  as he smacks him in the face and threatens to gouge out his eyeballs.
[03:55:33.000 --> 03:55:38.000]  Another example of the fantastic cultural enrichment that Europe is currently enjoying.
[03:55:38.000 --> 03:55:47.000]  More cultural enrichment news, Sharia Street Patrol in Austria hospitalises father protecting his daughter.
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:50.000]  Of course, Sharia Patrol's Muslim no-go ghettos don't exist.
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:52.000]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[03:55:52.000 --> 03:55:57.000]  You won't get hounded, chased out, kicked out of them if you dare venture into them.
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:56:00.000]  According to the mainstream media, they don't exist.
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:04.000]  So I guess if we believe that, then we can just pretend that none of this is happening
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:09.000]  and snuggle up in bed and everything's going to be all right.
[03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:15.000]  Louder with Crowder reports, Super Leftist JK Rowling defends Donald Trump.
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  So basically, JK Rowling, who wrote the Harry Potter novels,
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:24.000]  got up and gave a speech during this gala in which he was receiving an award
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:30.000]  and said that, quote, Trump's freedom to speak protects my freedom to call him a bigger.
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  So even though she's diametrically opposed to him politically,
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:38.000]  she understands, she's an actual classical liberal,
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:42.000]  that if you silence, if you suppress, if you censor somebody else's free speech,
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:47.000]  then eventually that censorship is going to impact you.
[03:56:47.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  And of course, that's off the back of hundreds of thousands of morons in the UK
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:56.000]  signing a petition to ban Donald Trump.
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:57:01.000]  So JK Rowling got up and said, if you ban somebody who's, quote, unpopular,
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:05.000]  if you ban their free speech, then everyone's free speech is a threat.
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  Of course, very few leftists will now admit that
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  and they're even now feeding on each other and sending each other's free speech.
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:18.000]  So she's probably going to be the next target of social justice warrior meltdown.
[03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:23.000]  Paris police car set ablaze as officers protest brutality against them.
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:27.000]  Basically leftist militias, lazy French people who got a bid,
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:33.000]  don't want to work over 35 hours a week, if asked to by their employers,
[03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  are now going crazy. They're attacking police.
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:41.000]  They're setting police cars on fire after the police held their own rally
[03:57:41.000 --> 03:57:45.000]  to protest against the brutality being meted out against them.
[03:57:45.000 --> 03:57:48.000]  So that's starting to boil over in Paris.
[03:57:48.000 --> 03:57:53.000]  Ex-General says NATO Russia nuclear war possible within a year.
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:58.000]  Again, hyping the necessity for the further encirclement of Russia claiming that
[03:57:58.000 --> 03:58:03.000]  it's Russia that's the militant threat and they're being surrounded by, you know,
[03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:07.000]  these missile defense shields, which of course are said to be in Iran,
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:10.000]  but in fact are about isolating Russia.
[03:58:10.000 --> 03:58:16.000]  Daily caller reports black Iowa student starts fight, loses, makes up hate crime, gets caught.
[03:58:16.000 --> 03:58:20.000]  Savage hate crime that University of Iowa that sent shockwaves across campus
[03:58:20.000 --> 03:58:22.000]  turned out to be just another hoax.
[03:58:22.000 --> 03:58:26.000]  We see that more and more with Black Lives Matter and radical leftists
[03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:29.000]  who commit violence and then play the victim.
[03:58:29.000 --> 03:58:32.000]  That's going to wrap up this edition of the AXJON show.
[03:58:32.000 --> 03:58:35.000]  In 4 Wars Nightly News tonight, Alex will be back with the radio show,
[03:58:35.000 --> 03:58:39.000]  11 to 2 tomorrow, breaking news at infowars.com.
