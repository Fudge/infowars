[00:00.000 --> 00:21.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:21.360 --> 00:29.640]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.640 --> 00:34.720]  Now as the Clinton crime machine fails to remove President Trump from office with the
[00:34.720 --> 00:41.600]  made up Russiagate garbage, they now intensify calls for him to be removed via the 25th amendment
[00:41.600 --> 00:44.720]  or calls intensify for him to be assassinated.
[00:44.720 --> 00:45.720]  That's all over the news.
[00:45.720 --> 00:49.800]  You've got the Antifa uprising groups and the hashtag hunt Republicans and Republicans
[00:49.800 --> 00:55.200]  getting attacked in their yards and shot in their yards and shot at baseball games.
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.080]  And I've pointed out that there's a criminal network within the FBI run by the Clintons
[01:00.080 --> 01:02.680]  and that's mainstream media now.
[01:02.680 --> 01:07.840]  So how does the Washington Post, how does the Soros group, Media Matters, spin that?
[01:07.840 --> 01:17.160]  They come out with the talking point two days ago saying that I'm saying the FBI itself
[01:17.160 --> 01:20.960]  is going to kill Trump.
[01:20.960 --> 01:24.160]  That's like saying the Post Office is.
[01:24.160 --> 01:26.680]  I didn't say that.
[01:26.680 --> 01:31.280]  There's the headline now the Washington Post, Fox News contributor channeling Alex Jones
[01:31.280 --> 01:34.080]  suggests FBI plot to assassinate Trump.
[01:34.080 --> 01:39.560]  So two days ago, Media Matters puts out the talking points is what they do and mainstream
[01:39.560 --> 01:43.520]  media comes to that like dog to a vomit.
[01:43.520 --> 01:47.880]  And they then put out permutations of the disinfo.
[01:47.880 --> 01:48.880]  That's how they do it.
[01:48.880 --> 01:52.600]  How dare Alex Jones say the FBI is going to kill the president.
[01:52.600 --> 01:59.160]  I said globalist operatives within the Secret Service is where I'd look first or some wind
[01:59.160 --> 02:00.160]  up crazy.
[02:00.160 --> 02:06.400]  They've gotten their network because the FBI cabal, the Clinton cabal in the FBI is failing.
[02:06.400 --> 02:14.080]  That's what I said, but they spend their whole world, their whole time trying to then again
[02:14.080 --> 02:18.640]  misrepresent that and what they'll do is they'll strategically pick things they want to attack
[02:18.640 --> 02:23.280]  us on and then misrepresent it.
[02:23.280 --> 02:26.480]  Alex Jones, I think they're going to go ahead and make their move to kill the president
[02:26.480 --> 02:27.480]  the next 30 days.
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.880]  And then it goes on to say that I say it's the FBI.
[02:31.880 --> 02:33.200]  And that's the kind of games they play.
[02:33.200 --> 02:37.840]  You know, I talk about discovery channel shows about this growing phenomenon of folks that
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.680]  have sex with their cars, didn't say it was heterosexual or homosexual.
[02:41.680 --> 02:46.960]  I said it's a new sexual designation and I said pretty soon there's going to be thousands
[02:46.960 --> 02:47.960]  of these.
[02:47.960 --> 02:51.880]  It's impossible to have all these alphabet acronyms that you're supposed to know.
[02:51.880 --> 02:56.720]  They have the headlines everywhere that Jones claims gay men are having, we'll try to rape
[02:56.720 --> 02:57.720]  your car.
[02:57.720 --> 02:59.720]  He didn't say that.
[02:59.720 --> 03:05.560]  But again, it's how they misrepresent.
[03:05.560 --> 03:07.880]  It's very hamfisted as well.
[03:07.880 --> 03:08.960]  Now we come back from break.
[03:08.960 --> 03:10.360]  We've got huge news.
[03:10.360 --> 03:17.080]  Former assisted FBI director, Paterson within the FBI are set to expose Mueller and Comey.
[03:17.080 --> 03:23.760]  That's what we were told yesterday by our very own source, Doug Hagman, that his FBI
[03:23.760 --> 03:25.880]  sources say that's the word.
[03:25.880 --> 03:31.720]  Also we're going to tie that into another clip from James Colstrom where he says, sick
[03:31.720 --> 03:35.880]  of fans in the FBI guilty of obstruction of justice.
[03:35.880 --> 03:40.320]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down as well.
[03:40.320 --> 03:42.800]  And then of course the big news, they said it couldn't happen.
[03:42.800 --> 03:43.800]  It happened.
[03:43.800 --> 03:48.560]  They agreed, it would leave the house, go back to the Senate, go back into conference
[03:48.560 --> 03:49.920]  because they changed it again.
[03:49.920 --> 03:50.920]  It happened.
[03:50.920 --> 03:57.560]  But still it passed a devastating victory for the American people against the globalist,
[03:57.560 --> 04:01.720]  Merry Christmas from the Liberty Movement, Merry Christmas from the Freedom Caucus, Merry
[04:01.720 --> 04:05.320]  Christmas from Drudge Report, Merry Christmas from M. Full Wars, Merry Christmas from the
[04:05.320 --> 04:10.160]  Liberty Movement who want to sovereign nation and who want a fair shake and who want real
[04:10.160 --> 04:11.800]  economics that made the country great.
[04:11.800 --> 04:17.440]  We're well on the path to making America great again, victory after victory after victory
[04:17.440 --> 04:23.120]  on NAFTA and GAT being renegotiated, on TPP being killed, on the stock market and all
[04:23.120 --> 04:30.160]  these new jobs and on the best numbers in decades, some of the best numbers ever, globalism
[04:30.160 --> 04:34.400]  having its back broken political correctness in deep trouble.
[04:34.400 --> 04:41.640]  The problem is I thought Democrats and their minions were foaming at the mouth earlier when
[04:41.640 --> 04:42.640]  Trump won.
[04:42.640 --> 04:47.800]  Now, on the streets of Austin, I've seen it, they have gone into full foaming at the mouth
[04:47.800 --> 04:50.840]  and I've noticed it's spiritual, it's spiritual.
[04:50.840 --> 04:54.680]  These people are possessed by like a foaming at the mouth spirit.
[04:54.680 --> 04:59.120]  I may even tell a story of what happened last night, I've got video too.
[04:59.120 --> 05:03.760]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Infowars Life.
[05:03.760 --> 05:07.720]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[05:07.720 --> 05:11.560]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[05:11.560 --> 05:15.360]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[05:15.360 --> 05:17.200]  particles in the gut.
[05:17.200 --> 05:19.640]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[05:19.640 --> 05:23.560]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[05:23.560 --> 05:26.760]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[05:26.760 --> 05:31.320]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[05:31.320 --> 05:34.120]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[05:34.120 --> 05:38.320]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[05:38.320 --> 05:42.280]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[05:42.280 --> 05:46.640]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so
[05:46.640 --> 05:49.320]  you can fully digest all types of meals.
[05:49.320 --> 05:53.400]  Don't let a meal go to waste, use carnivore by Infowars Life.
[05:53.400 --> 06:15.200]  Listen to InfowarsLife.com and secure your bottle now, that's InfowarsLife.com.
[06:23.400 --> 06:28.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are Back Live and we are Broadcasting Worldwide.
[06:28.520 --> 06:35.560]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and here we are on the 20th day of December, 2017, just ten
[06:35.560 --> 06:40.440]  and a half days left in this historic over-the-top year.
[06:40.440 --> 06:46.720]  We should open the phones up today and tomorrow and just talk about this year.
[06:46.720 --> 06:52.920]  It has been a tumultuous year, it has been an incredible year, it's been a roller coaster,
[06:52.920 --> 06:57.280]  it's had highs, it's had lows in my personal life, I know in many of your personal lives,
[06:57.280 --> 07:06.960]  it's just been insane, insane compared to any other year in modern history.
[07:06.960 --> 07:12.440]  We're entering a very important time historically and Bill Scalzen, who's been dead on the money
[07:12.440 --> 07:20.840]  so far, the World Affairs Brief, said Trump is planning to hit North Korea.
[07:20.840 --> 07:29.520]  At this point, they are planning to hit them by February and that could lead to just Armageddon-like
[07:29.520 --> 07:36.760]  scenarios, if Russia and China don't stay out of it, if Russia and China stays out of
[07:36.760 --> 07:40.240]  it, Kim Jong-un is going to be removed.
[07:40.240 --> 07:45.760]  His weapons certainly are, but that is something huge, so for all the good things happening,
[07:45.760 --> 07:49.680]  really big crises are on the horizon.
[07:49.680 --> 07:55.640]  Trump secures major victory as Senate Republicans pass the $1.5 trillion tax cut bill despite
[07:55.640 --> 08:02.760]  Democrats warning they'll rue the day as protesters scream, don't kill us, paving the
[08:02.760 --> 08:09.680]  way for a final House vote today after a hiccup, because then it goes back into conference.
[08:09.680 --> 08:15.800]  And that's why I keep saying this thing just gets so incredibly confusing because it just
[08:15.800 --> 08:22.880]  goes back and forth forever, but Trump has already gotten much of the big agenda through.
[08:22.880 --> 08:30.160]  Tax cut Christmas, home sales best in 11 years, Cohen market will roar more, yeah they said
[08:30.160 --> 08:42.160]  it would never hit 3%, it's now at 3.3, and the word is it's going to hit 7% to 10% is
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.680]  what most analysts say.
[08:43.680 --> 08:51.520]  Then you look at what's up on Infowars.com, we have got just masses of key news like
[08:51.520 --> 09:00.760]  this one, former assistant FBI director, Patriots from the FBI sent to expose Mueller and Comey,
[09:00.760 --> 09:09.080]  and he goes on in the video in the article to say that sycophants in the FBI guilty of
[09:09.080 --> 09:19.040]  obstruction of justice, and it is a Clinton cabal, a Clinton mole group, like a corporate
[09:19.040 --> 09:25.760]  takeover group that were put in by the Clintons, and then expanded by Obama, and Bush just
[09:25.760 --> 09:31.200]  went along with it all, all part of the same globalist crew, and they are caught red-handed
[09:31.200 --> 09:39.440]  manufacturing the entire fake dossier and all of it, and admitting it's fake, and that's
[09:39.440 --> 09:43.440]  what's powerful, and paying taxpayer money for it to their own family members, McCabe's
[09:43.440 --> 09:53.720]  wife got a half million, or his wife got 2 million at Fusion GPS, I mean they are not
[09:53.720 --> 09:59.600]  just doing all this unethical stuff for no reason, they are doing it for cold, hard green
[09:59.600 --> 10:06.600]  backs, digitally delivered to their stinking bank accounts, and so these are the type of
[10:06.600 --> 10:13.840]  people put in by Mueller, put in by Comey, put in by Bill Clinton and then Obama's reign,
[10:13.840 --> 10:16.960]  and they are the worst of the worst, and people are calling them out for what they are, and
[10:16.960 --> 10:20.120]  so you got Scarborough and all the rest of them saying, this is going to cause civil
[10:20.120 --> 10:32.240]  war, this is going to cause death in the streets, because they are being defeated, and I think
[10:32.240 --> 10:38.920]  I am going to download the video off my phone later and play some of it, because I was getting
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.160]  phone calls while I was taping it, so it kept cutting the feeds, I only got part of it taped,
[10:43.160 --> 10:50.040]  so I go outside and take a phone call at a restaurant last night, and this family, this
[10:50.040 --> 10:56.120]  older woman, and three men and another woman, there are four men come and get in my face
[10:56.120 --> 11:00.720]  and start flipping me off and doing the sign of the curse and saying, you are going to
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.880]  jail, Trump is going to jail, and they go, your wife in there, and your baby, are you
[11:04.880 --> 11:10.960]  child molesters, you have sex with that baby, because of course we talked about what was
[11:10.960 --> 11:14.520]  going on in the WikiLeaks, the Democrats and the rest of it, and all the stuff coming
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.400]  out about the Vatican, and I just said, listen, you are such a vicious evil person, and she
[11:18.400 --> 11:23.280]  just kept talking about it about my wife and a baby that were inside, and just the nastiness
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.080]  in there, I walked over her car, I said, well you guys want to get my face, I will follow
[11:26.080 --> 11:32.640]  you over here, and then there it was, the she persevered Hillary sticker, and she couldn't
[11:32.640 --> 11:36.480]  believe she was going to cuss and yell and get in my face, and then I wasn't just going
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.720]  to stand up to him, but I caught some of it on tape, I was getting these phone calls,
[11:40.720 --> 11:44.560]  one after the other while I was taping it, and a couple of guys kind of bowed up, and
[11:44.560 --> 11:50.080]  I just said, come on, but they literally think we are Nazis in the enemy, they are trying
[11:50.080 --> 11:52.960]  to save the country, and they don't even get anything from it most of them, they are just
[11:52.960 --> 11:58.160]  idiot camp followers, and as they get their bucks handed to them politically, they are
[11:58.160 --> 12:06.600]  panicking more and more, so here is the first part, James Faustrum, former deputy director
[12:06.600 --> 12:10.680]  of the FBI, Patri is the FBI's set to expose Mueller and come here it is.
[12:10.680 --> 12:17.560]  I have said in my opinion, it is an opinion, there is a cabal active within the FBI and
[12:17.560 --> 12:23.080]  the Justice Department, which hates Trump, which protected Hillary Clinton, and tried
[12:23.080 --> 12:29.200]  to bring down Donald Trump, and that is an extraordinary story of interference in an
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.240]  American presidential election, and you are agreeing with me on this?
[12:33.240 --> 12:39.400]  Yes, and we have been talking about this in different terms, now we are saying a cabal
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.640]  without question, that is what it was, just like the whole so-called Clinton investigation
[12:43.640 --> 12:48.240]  was phony from the beginning, we have talked about that, no grand jury, giving witnesses
[12:48.240 --> 12:53.160]  immunity, putting all the subjects in one room at the same time, I mean it is crazy,
[12:53.160 --> 12:55.240]  I mean it is not what they did.
[12:55.240 --> 12:58.640]  Look James, I have got coming up on a hard break, but I want to ask this question, you
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.000]  got 20 seconds, what is morale like in the FBI now?
[13:03.000 --> 13:10.320]  It is not good, but I think recent events that I am aware of are going to improve that
[13:10.320 --> 13:14.000]  because there is going to be actually something that is going to happen in my view.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.160]  Are you going to leave us on that?
[13:16.160 --> 13:18.320]  James, you have got to come back.
[13:18.320 --> 13:22.680]  Well I think there is a lot of patriots that are just headed up to here with what is going
[13:22.680 --> 13:28.640]  on, and they are going to step forward and tell people what the shenanigans have been,
[13:28.640 --> 13:36.400]  how they shut down the Clinton Foundation investigation, how other things were done that are so anti
[13:36.400 --> 13:39.800]  what the FBI in the United States and this country is about.
[13:39.800 --> 13:43.560]  We want to hear it James Carlstrom, we want to hear it here.
[13:43.560 --> 13:47.960]  We do as well, and when we come back we are going to play an even larger clip, but this
[13:47.960 --> 13:51.880]  is powerful, and this is word for word what we have broken down before it was even in
[13:51.880 --> 13:52.880]  congressional hearings.
[13:52.880 --> 13:59.280]  So again, InfoWars has led the way as the tip of the spear to break down the wall and
[13:59.280 --> 14:02.360]  expose this and make it safe for others to talk about it.
[14:02.360 --> 14:03.360]  That is why we are here.
[14:03.360 --> 14:04.360]  That is why you are here.

[20:01.720 --> 20:20.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.120 --> 20:25.920]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[20:25.920 --> 20:30.080]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:30.080 --> 20:36.040]  Just to be clear, the tax bill has, for all intents and purposes, passed by the House
[20:36.040 --> 20:37.800]  and Senate.
[20:37.800 --> 20:43.880]  But there's a few pieces that are a little bit different and it's routines, what they
[20:43.880 --> 20:47.000]  call it, and they've got to line those back up.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.720]  There's still debate going on, but experts say that hardly ever has something gotten
[20:52.720 --> 20:54.320]  derailed at this point.
[20:54.320 --> 20:55.320]  But anything could happen.
[20:55.320 --> 21:00.760]  So again, the tax bill in its main body has gone back and forth between the House and
[21:00.760 --> 21:06.640]  Senate, but it's being reported that one more likely routine vote in the House and the bill
[21:06.640 --> 21:11.240]  could be on his desk as soon as this afternoon, then he will have one of his first big press
[21:11.240 --> 21:13.840]  conferences in quite a while.
[21:13.840 --> 21:17.720]  So we're going to be following that throughout the broadcast today and right through the
[21:17.720 --> 21:25.720]  day.
[21:25.720 --> 21:35.840]  Let's continue here with this amazing former FBI Director James Colstrom on Fox News.
[21:35.840 --> 21:38.640]  We just played the clip where he said, this is incredibly criminal.
[21:38.640 --> 21:40.520]  This is a cabal.
[21:40.520 --> 21:42.040]  They're rigging everything.
[21:42.040 --> 21:43.040]  It's unheard of.
[21:43.040 --> 21:45.480]  Witnesses all in the same rooms, on and on and on.
[21:45.480 --> 21:48.880]  What isn't getting pointed out is they're not just paying money, they're paying money
[21:48.880 --> 21:57.440]  to their family members, husbands to wives from the Justice Department and the FBI to
[21:57.440 --> 21:58.440]  make it up.
[21:58.440 --> 22:01.000]  I mean, these are the people over it.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.280]  It's just the most classic inside family job you've ever seen.
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.800]  So the media is spinning it that, oh, we're saying the FBI did this.
[22:10.800 --> 22:14.560]  And Alex Jones says the FBI is going to kill Trump, said no such thing.
[22:14.560 --> 22:23.080]  I said a criminal cabal inside a criminal racketeering organization with basic manager
[22:23.080 --> 22:28.080]  fraud from the top has been caught doing this.
[22:28.080 --> 22:33.720]  And if they can't take him out with this criminal plot inside a rogue group in the FBI, they're
[22:33.720 --> 22:35.560]  going to try to kill the president.
[22:35.560 --> 22:37.040]  That's their last option.
[22:37.040 --> 22:40.480]  They've been talking about how he needs to be killed, how they want him dead.
[22:40.480 --> 22:43.360]  Then they go, oh, Jones is crazy in the Washington Post.
[22:43.360 --> 22:47.160]  He thinks the average FBI agent and all the FBI are in on it.
[22:47.160 --> 22:50.040]  That's how they misrepresent.
[22:50.040 --> 22:54.400]  Let's go back to this other clip that, again, is on infowars.com that everybody should share
[22:54.400 --> 22:55.400]  of this.
[22:55.400 --> 22:58.040]  Paul Joseph Watson, articles around the front page, I'm going to retweet it at real Alex
[22:58.040 --> 22:59.040]  Jones.
[22:59.040 --> 23:00.040]  It's so important.
[23:00.040 --> 23:01.040]  If you guys will do that for me.
[23:01.040 --> 23:02.040]  Thank you.
[23:02.040 --> 23:03.040]  This is really easy to get out there.
[23:03.040 --> 23:06.320]  And we should probably add to this article all the other congressmen and people that have
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.320]  pointed this out as well.
[23:07.320 --> 23:08.600]  This is what happened.
[23:08.600 --> 23:09.840]  They've been caught.
[23:09.840 --> 23:10.840]  They admit this now.
[23:10.840 --> 23:13.560]  That's why a bunch of them are refusing to testify.
[23:13.560 --> 23:15.560]  So the plot is really, really thickening right now.
[23:15.560 --> 23:18.240]  They are desperate.
[23:18.240 --> 23:21.840]  James Colstrom, Patriots in the FBI are set to expose Mueller and Comey.
[23:21.840 --> 23:22.840]  Played that.
[23:22.840 --> 23:23.840]  Here's the next one.
[23:23.840 --> 23:24.840]  Sick offense.
[23:24.840 --> 23:25.840]  Absolutely.
[23:25.840 --> 23:27.200]  In the FBI, guilty of obstruction of justice.
[23:27.200 --> 23:36.920]  That means an inner, sick, white shoe boy club of Democrats in the system saying we're
[23:36.920 --> 23:38.760]  not going to let him stay in office.
[23:38.760 --> 23:39.760]  We're going to remove him.
[23:39.760 --> 23:43.360]  We're going to make up this dossier and then they admit it's fake and they admittedly paid
[23:43.360 --> 23:44.360]  their families for it.
[23:44.360 --> 23:46.600]  That's the money they got for doing it.
[23:46.600 --> 23:49.760]  That's how they got paid for committing the crime.
[23:49.760 --> 23:53.680]  He said the fifth of state has been working to sabotage President Trump led by a bunch
[23:53.680 --> 23:58.040]  of sick offense in the FBI who are guilty of obstruction of justice.
[23:58.040 --> 24:02.480]  Colstrom, a career FBI guy, deputy director, is an attack on the FBI.
[24:02.480 --> 24:06.160]  He's attacking that it's been hijacked by people destroying it.
[24:06.160 --> 24:07.360]  But they turned it around.
[24:07.360 --> 24:08.360]  Oh, Colstrom.
[24:08.360 --> 24:09.360]  He doesn't lie.
[24:09.360 --> 24:10.840]  I mean, that's the next talking point.
[24:10.840 --> 24:13.240]  Colstrom says the FBI is pure evil.
[24:13.240 --> 24:15.480]  When he's a classic G-man.
[24:15.480 --> 24:17.520]  Now, let's go ahead and play the clip.
[24:17.520 --> 24:24.280]  Is the FBI probe of leading politicians totally and hopelessly politicized?
[24:24.280 --> 24:25.280]  Come on in, please.
[24:25.280 --> 24:30.440]  James Colstrom, former FBI assistant director, he's always had something to say about this.
[24:30.440 --> 24:31.840]  What do you got to say about it now?
[24:31.840 --> 24:34.760]  Well, you know, let's do it for over a year and a half, I think.
[24:34.760 --> 24:38.080]  We've been talking about this sort of reverse crescendo.
[24:38.080 --> 24:43.280]  We started off with Jim Comey and all his crazy actions that I thought were outside
[24:43.280 --> 24:46.040]  the main of how the FBI should operate.
[24:46.040 --> 24:52.080]  And now we come to this, you know, this focus on, you know, the fifth estate that I've talked
[24:52.080 --> 24:56.880]  about, you know, that includes multiplicities of people.
[24:56.880 --> 25:02.760]  But now we know it also includes a bunch of sick offense in the FBI, you know, that they
[25:02.760 --> 25:06.200]  were part of the Comey team, apparently.
[25:06.200 --> 25:13.560]  And people in justice also, that I believe have exposure now for obstruction of justice.
[25:13.560 --> 25:19.840]  I mean, people, you know, they people tweet each other and they send text messages, but
[25:19.840 --> 25:20.840]  they don't plan.
[25:20.840 --> 25:26.000]  The FBI is not the business of planning to destroy a president of the United States.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.880]  I mean, and it's clear to me that that's what they were.
[25:28.880 --> 25:30.200]  I think they were.
[25:30.200 --> 25:32.080]  I think they had, I think they were trying.
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.160]  I think they were way above their capability.
[25:35.160 --> 25:38.160]  You know, this guy thinks he's the lone range of this construct.
[25:38.160 --> 25:39.160]  Exactly.
[25:39.160 --> 25:42.760]  It shows how weak the Clintons really are, how they could just over the years get these
[25:42.760 --> 25:47.000]  top people in, have them cover up and kill investigations over the years.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  And then they went too far.
[25:48.000 --> 25:49.920]  It's one thing to kill an investigation.
[25:49.920 --> 25:54.760]  It's another thing to manufacture one against a popular president.
[25:54.760 --> 25:57.040]  And then you get caught and then it all comes out.
[25:57.040 --> 26:00.440]  And then they're panicking, hoping people don't keep pointing this out.
[26:00.440 --> 26:04.240]  That's why they're now they go, Oh, Mueller will make his announcement at the end of next
[26:04.240 --> 26:06.680]  year, hoping we forget about this.
[26:06.680 --> 26:10.680]  And he'll have a Kushner indictment or something to make it look like it's all real.
[26:10.680 --> 26:11.680]  Let's continue.
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.920]  He's going to float in here and if by any chance the Trump gets elected, which is a
[26:16.920 --> 26:22.520]  catastrophe in his mind, I mean, I don't know what his mind is thinking, Obama basically
[26:22.520 --> 26:23.520]  destroyed the country.
[26:23.520 --> 26:25.480]  Now you have a guy that wants to fix it.
[26:25.480 --> 26:26.480]  Okay.
[26:26.480 --> 26:30.680]  But, but anyway, if that's his thinking, you know, and they were obviously from the words
[26:30.680 --> 26:34.040]  that we saw there in Andy's office plotting some kind of thing.
[26:34.040 --> 26:37.400]  And I think that's some kind of thing is what we're seeing right now.
[26:37.400 --> 26:42.600]  And we've seen for the last whatever sense he's been elected, we've seen this facade
[26:42.600 --> 26:48.720]  and this phony challenge to Trump about collusion in Russia, which nothing could be further
[26:48.720 --> 26:49.720]  from the truth.
[26:49.720 --> 26:51.800]  All the collusions with the Democrats.
[26:51.800 --> 26:54.120]  And it's very, very depressing to the FBI.
[26:54.120 --> 27:01.280]  Well, FBI agents, I mean, 99.9% are hardworking patriotic guys that come to work and girls
[27:01.280 --> 27:04.320]  come to work, you know, for the, for the good of the country.
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.080]  And you've got this cabal of people, you know, you've got this deputy director who should
[27:09.080 --> 27:12.520]  have been out long time ago for his actions.
[27:12.520 --> 27:16.360]  And then you got Peter Struck and who knows how many others, you know, and you got Comey
[27:16.360 --> 27:21.960]  with all the Matt, all the phony stuff that he did leaking and, you know, but I think,
[27:21.960 --> 27:24.480]  I think finally we're going to get to the end of this.
[27:24.480 --> 27:27.040]  But the big mystery here is the Justice Department.
[27:27.040 --> 27:29.640]  What is the Justice Department doing?
[27:29.640 --> 27:32.240]  What is the Attorney General of the United States doing?
[27:32.240 --> 27:36.680]  You know, it's too bad for Donald Trump, who's I've known for a long, long time.
[27:36.680 --> 27:41.840]  And with all his little things that he does that people don't like his policies of what's
[27:41.840 --> 27:47.560]  going to bring this at the United States back globally, in my view, yet, you know, you have
[27:47.560 --> 27:52.280]  this huge storm of people that are just putting roadblock after roadblock.
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.000]  It's a mystery to me why he hasn't called over to the Attorney General and told the
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.400]  Attorney General, give the oversight committees the documents they're looking for.
[28:02.400 --> 28:09.000]  Why is the Trump Justice Department not complying with subpoenas from the Justice Department
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.720]  that want to look at this thing?
[28:11.720 --> 28:13.840]  That's because they've committed such massive crimes.
[28:13.840 --> 28:16.840]  They know the whole house of cars is going to fall and they're all blackmailing other
[28:16.840 --> 28:20.640]  people for things they've been compiling on them.
[28:20.640 --> 28:21.640]  And that's what's happened.
[28:21.640 --> 28:23.280]  And that's why they're paralyzed.
[28:23.280 --> 28:24.880]  But now they've been exposed.
[28:24.880 --> 28:27.240]  So now there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[28:27.240 --> 28:32.160]  That's why this is so explosive and why the only move they've got left, well, they got
[28:32.160 --> 28:33.160]  two moves.
[28:33.160 --> 28:37.720]  They're going to bring out hundreds of fake women that say that Trump attacked them.
[28:37.720 --> 28:38.880]  People aren't going to buy that.
[28:38.880 --> 28:39.880]  They already see that failing.
[28:39.880 --> 28:41.280]  They're like, why don't we have Frank and leave?
[28:41.280 --> 28:42.280]  None of this is working.
[28:42.280 --> 28:47.640]  So the next thing is riot, civil war, trying to make him step down 25th Amendment and or
[28:47.640 --> 28:48.640]  killing.
[28:48.640 --> 28:49.640]  But all three of those things go together.
[28:49.640 --> 28:51.160]  So really, I guess there's three things there.
[28:51.160 --> 28:57.840]  The big one is trying to kill the president, we'll be right back.
[28:57.840 --> 29:01.280]  Hey, Daniel Brieman, why new manna storeable foods?

[29:27.920 --> 29:30.480]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[29:30.480 --> 29:31.480]  That's true.
[29:31.480 --> 29:35.240]  But did you know you can have tax free access to your life insurance while you're still
[29:35.240 --> 29:36.480]  alive?
[29:36.480 --> 29:40.080]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty

[29:53.320 --> 29:59.160]  That's 702-660-7000.
[29:59.160 --> 30:03.400]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you
[30:03.400 --> 30:08.760]  a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[30:08.760 --> 30:13.720]  Number one, when you choose auto ship before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order
[30:13.720 --> 30:15.320]  at InfoWareShore.com.
[30:15.320 --> 30:19.200]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for
[30:19.200 --> 30:23.280]  auto ship because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[30:23.280 --> 30:28.520]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[30:28.520 --> 30:32.600]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder
[30:32.600 --> 30:34.360]  the products that you need each month.
[30:34.360 --> 30:38.440]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto
[30:38.440 --> 30:42.120]  ship and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[30:42.120 --> 30:46.400]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWare's
[30:46.400 --> 30:50.360]  Life.com, this is a sure win, 10% off on auto ship.
[30:50.360 --> 30:54.760]  Win, win, win at InfoWare's Life.com, free shipping on orders above $50.
[30:54.760 --> 30:58.640]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[30:58.640 --> 31:05.000]  I want to plow into all of this that I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[31:05.000 --> 31:12.520]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos
[31:12.520 --> 31:18.640]  or other material from InfoWareStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[31:18.640 --> 31:20.840]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[31:20.840 --> 31:24.520]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWareStore.com.
[31:24.520 --> 31:28.240]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste
[31:28.240 --> 31:32.080]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodide in it.
[31:32.080 --> 31:33.400]  You cannot beat that.
[31:33.400 --> 31:37.160]  For children and adults, we've got the best mouthwash, designed by Dr. Jones, that's
[31:37.160 --> 31:44.320]  my dad, colloidal silver and iodine as well, InfoWare's Life.com, or triple-A-253-3139.
[31:44.320 --> 31:48.760]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[31:48.760 --> 31:51.600]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[31:51.600 --> 31:54.720]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back
[31:54.720 --> 31:58.920]  against us, so we need your support.
[31:58.920 --> 32:05.060]  Use to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and Biotrue Selenium.
[32:05.060 --> 32:09.760]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[32:09.760 --> 32:15.480]  Biotrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic
[32:15.480 --> 32:16.680]  mustard seed.

[32:22.840 --> 32:25.360]  pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[32:25.360 --> 32:30.040]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence
[32:30.040 --> 32:33.120]  every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.800]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight
[32:37.800 --> 32:40.800]  gain and overall brain fog.
[32:40.800 --> 32:46.680]  Survival Shield X2 and Biotrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[33:39.000 --> 34:01.760]  mustard seed and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[34:01.760 --> 34:14.840]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[34:14.840 --> 34:18.440]  Infowars comes to mind.
[34:18.440 --> 34:19.440]  Infowars.
[34:19.440 --> 34:20.440]  Infowars.
[34:20.440 --> 34:21.440]  Infowars.
[34:21.440 --> 34:22.440]  Infowars.
[34:22.440 --> 34:23.440]  Infowars.
[34:23.440 --> 34:33.440]  Infowars.
[34:33.440 --> 34:36.280]  Infowars.
[34:36.280 --> 34:43.280]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[35:06.280 --> 35:18.280]  Run on for a long time. Run on for a long time. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down. Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[35:18.280 --> 35:33.280]  Cuttin' those taxes. They've been lying about the tax bill, and it is a compromise in some areas, but it will bring back $4 trillion in the next year in corporate taxes that have been held offshore.
[35:33.280 --> 35:49.280]  And it will bring back thousands of companies. I mean, if people wanna work, they're gonna get a chance to work, and as there's new factories, it's gonna drive up wages, because there's gonna be competition for those products.
[35:49.280 --> 36:05.280]  There's gonna be competition for those workers. There's gonna be competition, and this is what Boomtown USA is gonna look like. The Globalist made the strategic decision back in the 60s to begin the deindustrialization of North America to transfer things to China.
[36:05.280 --> 36:17.280]  By the 80s, it began. And here we are, ladies and gentlemen. It is a big, big problem. It's a national security issue, and it is being reversed.
[36:17.280 --> 36:28.280]  Now, again, when I said that bills passed, the official bills passed the House and Senate. They've agreed to come back and forth in conference, but there were a few little mistakes where things aren't word for word the same.
[36:28.280 --> 36:38.280]  And so those are, quote, routine votes, and for all intents and purposes, they're saying 99% chance. It'll be done in the next hour or two.
[36:38.280 --> 36:51.280]  We're watching. We're gonna carry Trump's historic press conference. Hadn't done one in a while. Coming up today, the war room's gonna be on for three hours after I'm on live, because David Knight has the real news in the morning.
[36:51.280 --> 37:02.280]  Then, of course, Heidi M. Foer is live here with your host Alex Jones. And then, of course, Owen Troyer and Roger Stones, a contributor of many others, on the war room, three to six p.m. central.
[37:02.280 --> 37:14.280]  And I intend to bring the nightly news back the next four to five months, an hour every night, and I'm gonna be launching more broadcast as well here as we syndicate these radio slash TV transmissions.
[37:14.280 --> 37:21.280]  And our next big push is UHF, VHF, and cable stations. We've got quite a few picking us up, but we're gonna really be reaching out to those stations.
[37:21.280 --> 37:33.280]  We're gonna be creating a big page on the website about it where listeners can call their UHF, VHF stations, cable providers. And that's really gonna have a channel on cable. That's kind of a vanity fair thing people do.
[37:33.280 --> 37:42.280]  Beck did it. It failed, as everyone knows. And I'm sad it failed. But the whole point is just having a channel out of 10,000 and doing that.
[37:42.280 --> 37:51.280]  You want to just have cable systems that want to pick you up, be able to put you on those lower channels that people actually watch.
[37:51.280 --> 38:01.280]  And you want to be on the UHF and VHF stations. We've got more than 15 stations that carry us five, six, seven, eight hours a day, some 24 hours a day.
[38:01.280 --> 38:12.280]  But there's weird little stuff we've learned, like we show videos that are bleeped out of leftist cussing at people and things, but you can't show the flipping off either.
[38:12.280 --> 38:19.280]  So that's a whole new level. We have to blur that out and people watching on the Internet go, why are you boring without them flipping off?
[38:19.280 --> 38:35.280]  Because, you know, we pay for the closed captioning, hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. We pay for all this stuff. I mean, a lot of infrastructure goes into it. We're just building the shows, the research, the crews, the people, the studios, and we're finally there.
[38:35.280 --> 38:46.280]  I mean, we've already done a lot and reached tens of millions a week. But we're finally there to go after UHF, VHF and cable. And I knew this was coming in my gut a few years ago when we started building this.
[38:46.280 --> 39:04.280]  I knew the Internet censorship was coming on Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it. And one of the last places they're not going to stop us is directly to those local UHF, VHF, and cable stations where you've got patriots that are owning those channels or the program directors,
[39:04.280 --> 39:18.280]  and then just reaching out, letting them know it's there, getting it the way they want it, getting it on different platforms. A lot of them wanted on these TV-shared network systems and then you get into them and then you upload stuff like right after it's live and then they have that.
[39:18.280 --> 39:27.280]  Or there's basically these systems where it's near live, when we've got some of the satellites and then substations want this type, some want that type. It's very expensive.
[39:27.280 --> 39:36.280]  To me, all the satellites we need, we're probably talking $400,000 a year, not the hundred and something. I'll spend it on it right now. And it takes money to do that.
[39:36.280 --> 39:47.280]  So we're going to crash through the lives of disinformation. We're going to hit the bar bar. We're going to cover the news years before its mainstream. You're going to get tomorrow's news today.
[39:47.280 --> 39:53.280]  You're going to get next week's news today. You're going to get next year's news today. You see it all the time.
[39:53.280 --> 40:01.280]  Not that we're even that smart. It's in globalist documents. It's in trade publications. You can get it from top experts.
[40:01.280 --> 40:07.280]  What's already being beta tested? They don't want to discuss stuff till it's rolled out ubiquitous.
[40:07.280 --> 40:18.280]  We're just trying to have a societal discussion about GMO and about forced inoculation and about open borders and about globalism and about the brainwashing of children in schools and all of this.
[40:18.280 --> 40:29.280]  So when we come back from this break, I'm going to get into a bunch of other clips, get into the economy, get into military developments, this statement, stuff on newswars.com.
[40:29.280 --> 40:37.280]  Twitter exec, no longer possible to stand up for all speech. Social media site doesn't believe in free speech yet. It's all selectively enforced.
[40:37.280 --> 40:48.280]  And the word is the 28, their new rules go in. Paul Watson off prison planted on there, one of the top Twitter people, real Alex Jones, you name it.
[40:48.280 --> 40:55.280]  And they've warned other talk shows and people don't have Alex Jones on your podcast or whatever, or we'll censor you.
[40:55.280 --> 41:03.280]  Well, if you end up giving into that in their first wave, they'll submit it, they'll set the precedent, and then you'll be next. You'll be next.
[41:03.280 --> 41:11.280]  Don't be stupid. Stand up for free speech. We're going to go to break and get into all of this on the other side.
[41:11.280 --> 41:18.280]  Dr. Group's going to be in studio. We're taking your calls on a bunch of big news. And why does President Trump drink 12 Diet Cokes today?
[41:18.280 --> 41:24.280]  He admits it's garbage. But Coca Cola said, we don't like you drinking Coke. We're corporate. You're making us unpopular.
[41:24.280 --> 41:34.280]  Because they're globalist. He said, well, I still drink 12 of those garbages a day. Because it's addictive. It's an excitotox. We ought to get Dr. Blalock on a brain surgeon about it.
[41:34.280 --> 41:39.280]  But we're going to really give you the truth about Diet Coke as well on a bunch of other issues and take your calls coming up.
[41:39.280 --> 41:50.280]  But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, we have free shipping still store wide in the lower 48. You can still get delivery before Christmas.
[41:50.280 --> 41:55.280]  In fact, they still say Hawaii and Alaska, but I just don't believe it. But we're going to get everything shipped out on a daily basis.
[41:55.280 --> 42:02.280]  To be safe yesterday was the absolute day. But if you're anywhere, you can see the map that you're watching on TV.
[42:02.280 --> 42:11.280]  One day, from where we're at, is just Central Texas. And then two day is like half the country. Three day is the other half the country.
[42:11.280 --> 42:17.280]  And so there you go. Get it before Christmas, even in Alaska and Hawaii. But I just don't want to say guaranteed.
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.280]  OK, but it supports the broadcast. Don't have to fight the crowds. Don't have to fight the traffic.
[42:22.280 --> 42:32.280]  You can support the broadcast. 50% off our fluoride free, organic, super high quality toothpaste fortified with colloidal silver and high quality iodine.
[42:32.280 --> 42:38.280]  So it's great for you at the same time. Amazing what those people's gums read all the thousands of files to our reviews.
[42:38.280 --> 42:45.280]  People are just crazy about it. And we've got a bunch of other stuff 50% off. Check it out today and the new alpha power.
[42:45.280 --> 42:52.280]  Roger Stone said, I like some of the other products like brain force, but good Lord alpha power is unbelievable.
[42:52.280 --> 42:57.280]  Oh yeah, we made it to be explosive. Stamina energy libido.
[42:57.280 --> 43:06.280]  The house passed a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax bill Tuesday. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowers individual tax rates.
[43:06.280 --> 43:15.280]  Paul Ryan said today we are giving the people their money back, adding that a typical family would average about $2,000 in tax cuts in 2018.
[43:15.280 --> 43:25.280]  Zero Democrats voted to lower taxes. Instead, they were busy pushing the narrative that the floppy bill is a Franken monster set to benefit only corporations and the rich.
[43:25.280 --> 43:32.280]  But are they really just worried about a legislative accomplishment that will translate to more cold hard cash for middle class pockets?
[43:32.280 --> 43:44.280]  According to the Independent Tax Policy Center, 80% of taxpayers will get a tax cut in 2018. Only about 5% will pay more next year under the GOP plan.
[43:44.280 --> 43:54.280]  With approval from both chambers likely, the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system in more than 30 years could be signed into law by President Trump before the end of the week.

[47:01.280 --> 47:09.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:09.280 --> 47:24.280]  Here we go, here we go.
[47:24.280 --> 47:31.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists want to organize their coup against the American resurgence where we're taking back our country.
[47:31.280 --> 47:34.280]  It doesn't mean we're perfect. It doesn't mean we won't have problems.
[47:34.280 --> 47:39.840]  But this is a real counter coup that we've launched to bring back the country from globalism.
[47:39.840 --> 47:43.360]  They're launching a counter coup against our counter coup.
[47:43.360 --> 47:45.520]  They are launching an attempt to take the country back.
[47:45.520 --> 47:46.720]  They had a coup.
[47:46.720 --> 47:48.040]  We took it back partially.
[47:48.040 --> 47:50.600]  They're trying to take it back again.
[47:50.600 --> 47:58.680]  And now they are having the final House vote on some of the mistakes in the tax cut bill.
[47:58.680 --> 48:01.320]  It's officially been passed in the House and Senate.
[48:01.320 --> 48:03.040]  This is only a, quote, routine vote.
[48:03.040 --> 48:06.120]  I mean, they're going to honor their original vote that it's passed.
[48:06.120 --> 48:10.560]  That's why it's considered as passed.
[48:10.560 --> 48:13.560]  That's what the legislative scholars are saying.
[48:13.560 --> 48:22.240]  But still, Panky Panky or Chicanery or Skull Dugarty could be engaged in because bamboozling
[48:22.240 --> 48:24.800]  by these people never seems to end.
[48:24.800 --> 48:31.000]  We've got right now the votes habit so far with the votes ongoing, less than two minutes
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.160]  left for them to finish their vote.
[48:34.160 --> 48:40.240]  And we're at 158 to 144 or 158 to 152 total.
[48:40.240 --> 48:43.680]  So it looks like it's pretty close right now.
[48:43.680 --> 48:50.160]  We're going to be watching this as it unfolds because you're supposed to vote to just square
[48:50.160 --> 48:52.160]  up the two.
[48:52.160 --> 48:56.920]  That's how the legislative rules work, but we'll see.
[48:56.920 --> 49:04.960]  But here's the big story, breaking on infowars.com and newswars.com by Clifford Cunningham, Donald
[49:04.960 --> 49:08.760]  Trump Jr., top government officials are conspiring against the president.
[49:08.760 --> 49:10.760]  You're like, well, of course we know that.
[49:10.760 --> 49:13.000]  But now they're telling it like it is.
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.080]  You've got the former assistant deputy director or the former assistant FBI director, Patriots
[49:18.080 --> 49:24.280]  with the FBI, set to expose Mueller and Comey, says they're sick of fans, but they're going
[49:24.280 --> 49:25.800]  to be brought down.
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.480]  Donald Trump Jr., President Trump's son has warned top government officials are conspiring
[49:30.480 --> 49:35.200]  to undermine his father's administration as a witch hunt led by Clinton insider Robert
[49:35.200 --> 49:37.080]  Mueller continues.
[49:37.080 --> 49:41.480]  And when we finish up with this vote in a moment, we'll get back into this incredibly
[49:41.480 --> 49:42.480]  important article.
[49:42.480 --> 49:49.200]  Let's go back to C-SPAN right now with live feed of the vote that is nearing its completion
[49:49.200 --> 49:58.560]  in mere seconds, we're 30 seconds out, roughly right now, if you're a radio listener, you're
[49:58.560 --> 50:06.000]  hearing the sound in the house, it's been going back and forth into conference committees
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.600]  is such a big bill, and they find mistakes and it's got to go back and then go to a full
[50:10.600 --> 50:11.600]  vote.
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.160]  Again, they've already said in mainstream news that Trump has a Christmas victory, it's
[50:16.160 --> 50:17.160]  a huge victory.
[50:17.160 --> 50:23.320]  He's acting like it's done, but I don't trust him until the fat lady sings as they say.
[50:23.320 --> 50:33.360]  All right, the vote is now closing.
[50:33.360 --> 50:41.800]  Paul Ryan is signing off on something and is now approaching the gavel, the timer says
[50:41.800 --> 50:49.040]  zero time voting, sometimes they give them another two minutes or so under parliamentary
[50:49.040 --> 50:50.040]  rules.
[50:50.040 --> 50:56.200]  I don't pretend to be an expert of it, but I've been watching this stuff 30 years and
[50:56.200 --> 50:59.880]  covering it for 22 and it just you'll always give you a headache too because they can manipulate
[50:59.880 --> 51:06.000]  the rules, they can play all sorts of games, they can tell you it's past so people go home
[51:06.000 --> 51:14.000]  and then they sneak in with different maneuvers and kill it, I mean, what, 80% of Congress
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.600]  is lawyers, what's that tell you?
[51:16.600 --> 51:30.640]  All right, any minute now, they say the totals are 189 to 173, so the motion passes to make
[51:30.640 --> 51:35.640]  the House version line up with the final Senate version, and I believe that's it.
[51:35.640 --> 51:41.240]  But who knows, let's see, there might be a mistake in what they've done.
[51:41.240 --> 51:48.840]  There goes Paul Ryan, he's being handed the final vote tally, here we go, it's bigger
[51:48.840 --> 51:59.960]  the House, Paul Ryan.
[51:59.960 --> 52:07.640]  Tals 192 to 176, they've stopped voting, talk about cliffhanger, he's just sitting there
[52:07.640 --> 52:13.480]  and sitting there, get the articles on info wars.com, it's critical to get all of this
[52:13.480 --> 52:14.480]  out.
[52:14.480 --> 52:18.600]  Donald Trump Jr., top government officials conspiring against the president.
[52:18.600 --> 52:22.440]  There is and there are people at the highest levels of government, like Brad, that don't
[52:22.440 --> 52:29.560]  want to let America be America, Donald Trump Jr. said in a speech before a group of young
[52:29.560 --> 52:35.800]  conservatives at the Turning Point USA Student Association Summit in West Palm Beach, Florida.
[52:35.800 --> 52:40.160]  My father talked about a rigged system throughout the campaign, and people were like, oh, what
[52:40.160 --> 52:41.320]  are you talking about?
[52:41.320 --> 52:48.600]  But it is, and you're seeing it.
[52:48.600 --> 52:52.880]  The perceived impartiality of special counsel Robert Mueller investigation has collapsed
[52:52.880 --> 52:57.440]  following revelations of rampant political bias among members of the investigative team
[52:57.440 --> 53:08.360]  that was, again, a placed cabal, closed set group, paid for with outside money, FBI agent
[53:08.360 --> 53:12.600]  Peter Strock was removed from the investigative team after investigative revealed he sent
[53:12.600 --> 53:17.800]  numerous anti-Trump emails to a colleague admitting the conspiracy, and it goes through
[53:17.800 --> 53:22.840]  it all with powerful things that Donald Trump Jr. has laid out.
[53:22.840 --> 53:28.320]  In one email exchange, dating from August 2016, Strock wrote, there's no way he gets
[53:28.320 --> 53:30.720]  elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk.
[53:30.720 --> 53:34.640]  It's like an insurance policy, and the unlikely event, you die before you're 40.
[53:34.640 --> 53:39.880]  They go on to talk about meeting with the FBI deputy director to fix the information.
[53:39.880 --> 53:46.440]  Kind of like fixing WMD information that led us to war with Iraq, but this is to remove
[53:46.440 --> 53:50.760]  the president that really wants to return the power back to the U.S., the sovereignty,
[53:50.760 --> 53:53.080]  the decision-making processes.
[53:53.080 --> 53:58.880]  This is a revolution we're in against the globalist and against their coup over America,
[53:58.880 --> 54:00.440]  but we've only got the beach end.
[54:00.440 --> 54:04.840]  But now with these tax cuts, and now the economy coming back, and now with TPP killed, and
[54:04.840 --> 54:09.480]  now with 70% reduction in illegals coming across, and now with sovereignty returning,
[54:09.480 --> 54:13.880]  and now with the new jobs coming back, and all of this, it's banishing the globalists.
[54:13.880 --> 54:17.520]  It's showing them that they were parasites strangling us on purpose.
[54:17.520 --> 54:18.800]  That's what globalism is.
[54:18.800 --> 54:26.960]  It's strangling nation-states, especially for your countries in favor of authoritarians.
[54:26.960 --> 54:29.960]  This is a big, big, big tax reform bill.
[54:29.960 --> 54:33.000]  It's got a lot of really, really good things in it.
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.480]  Cutting the corporate tax alone, again, the big megacorporations are globalist.
[54:36.480 --> 54:38.480]  Their own record.
[54:38.480 --> 54:39.480]  I know you know this.
[54:39.480 --> 54:45.520]  We've got to get the word out to people that carp the BS and believe Bernie Sanders.
[54:45.520 --> 54:50.520]  Barking shields, the rich people, the rich people.
[54:50.520 --> 54:56.800]  Well, now C-SPAN is reporting it's just passed, but he's not struck the gavel and made the
[54:56.800 --> 54:58.520]  announcement yet.
[54:58.520 --> 55:01.720]  Again, the big megabanks want you to move overseas.
[55:01.720 --> 55:05.280]  They wanted to industrialize the U.S. to come in and buy it up for cheaper, and then have
[55:05.280 --> 55:10.760]  political control, and then use us the resources to only be a military colony, a force that's
[55:10.760 --> 55:13.400]  controlled by outside resources the globalists manipulate.
[55:13.400 --> 55:18.640]  It's all admitted by them, and they're white papers.
[55:18.640 --> 55:19.640]  He's gaveled it.
[55:19.640 --> 55:20.640]  Here we go.
[55:20.640 --> 55:29.920]  If China's got a 15 and we got a 38.9% tax rate, you think we're going to have any corporations
[55:29.920 --> 55:31.240]  that keep their money here?
[55:31.240 --> 55:34.360]  It's designed to make sure American money doesn't stay here.
[55:34.360 --> 55:35.840]  It's literal sabotage.
[55:35.840 --> 55:37.800]  Look at everything they do as sabotage.
[55:37.800 --> 55:42.640]  The schools, the media, they're all a criminal cabal of useful idiots praying on us.
[55:42.640 --> 55:44.280]  And I'm done.
[55:44.280 --> 55:49.200]  And just the idea that we're open for business has the money flooding back in, and this is
[55:49.200 --> 55:51.000]  a devastating victory.
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.200]  This is a devastating victory, devastating against the globalists.
[55:55.200 --> 55:57.200]  It's about to gavel.
[55:57.200 --> 56:09.320]  This is where I've never seen C-Span where the mic's not on, all right, it's the mic's
[56:09.320 --> 56:10.320]  not on.
[56:10.320 --> 56:15.080]  He just turned it on for the sound change.
[56:15.080 --> 56:20.320]  Well, you know, Fox is going to have it in HD with the audio.
[56:20.320 --> 56:23.360]  2.24, and the nays are 2.01.
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.680]  The motion is adopted without objection.
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.880]  The motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
[56:29.880 --> 56:33.000]  Well, there you go.
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.800]  Let's continue with this as we go out to break.
[56:34.800 --> 56:35.920]  This is amazing.
[56:35.920 --> 56:41.520]  And, you know, the globalists tried as much as they could to block this, but this is just
[56:41.520 --> 56:42.520]  provenance.
[56:42.520 --> 56:43.520]  This is such a big deal.
[56:43.520 --> 56:44.520]  Is the bill perfect?
[56:44.520 --> 56:45.520]  Absolutely not.
[56:45.520 --> 56:46.520]  But it's what the globalists didn't want.
[56:46.520 --> 56:50.520]  You're looking at 7% to 10% growth rate in one year if they're unable to try to plunge
[56:50.520 --> 56:52.520]  the economy somehow with their sabotage.
[56:52.520 --> 56:54.520]  Let's go out to break with the rest of the audio.
[56:54.520 --> 56:56.600]  Here they are reading the results.
[56:56.600 --> 57:01.080]  Space agency, and for other purposes.
[57:01.080 --> 57:04.640]  The question is, will the House have to spend the rules and pass the bill as amended?
[57:04.640 --> 57:06.880]  Rules will record their votes by electronic device.
[57:06.880 --> 57:08.080]  This is a five-minute vote.
[57:08.080 --> 57:09.080]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[57:09.080 --> 57:10.720]  They're still going through pieces of it, folks.
[57:10.720 --> 57:11.720]  That's what I was saying.
[57:11.720 --> 57:13.520]  The media's like, oh, look, it's happening right now.
[57:13.520 --> 57:17.960]  By a vote of 2.24 to 2.01, the U.S. House passes tax reform again.
[57:17.960 --> 57:22.720]  Actually, what they passed was agreeing to changes that the Senate made in the bill when
[57:22.720 --> 57:26.360]  they passed it earlier today by a vote of 51 to 48.
[57:26.360 --> 57:27.360]  Come on, come on up.
[57:27.360 --> 57:29.360]  The measure now goes to the President's desk.
[57:29.360 --> 57:30.760]  Come on, come on up.
[57:30.760 --> 57:32.480]  Headline as of passage.
[57:32.480 --> 57:34.800]  Let's go out and strangle a little, baby.
[57:34.800 --> 57:35.800]  Free shipping store-wide.
[57:35.800 --> 57:39.960]  You can still get packages before Christmas in most of the U.S. Thank you for the support.
[57:39.960 --> 57:41.440]  You made the InfoWare possible.
[57:41.440 --> 57:42.440]  This is you.
[57:42.440 --> 57:44.560]  You are the core resistance listeners and viewers.
[57:44.560 --> 57:48.240]  You are key.

[57:53.480 --> 57:59.840]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[57:59.840 --> 58:06.280]  levels begin to decline, starting around 30 at a rate of about 1 to 2 percent per year.
[58:06.280 --> 58:13.520]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[58:13.520 --> 58:18.000]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.000]  the market.
[58:19.000 --> 58:25.480]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated
[58:25.480 --> 58:32.440]  into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo
[58:32.440 --> 58:38.440]  from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.
[58:38.440 --> 58:42.400]  Reach your alpha male potential with alpha power.

[58:47.640 --> 58:51.760]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air.
[58:51.760 --> 58:52.760]  Another Matt.
[58:52.760 --> 58:53.760]  Go ahead.
[58:53.760 --> 58:58.200]  I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWare's, and I just wanted
[58:58.200 --> 59:03.240]  to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that
[59:03.240 --> 59:07.080]  really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWare.
[59:07.080 --> 59:12.720]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up
[59:12.720 --> 59:14.440]  right now are absolutely amazing.
[59:14.440 --> 59:15.440]  Well, thank you.
[59:15.440 --> 59:20.720]  My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but it says won't tread on me, and it's
[59:20.720 --> 59:25.440]  a big Daeglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, infowars.com on
[59:25.440 --> 59:26.440]  the right arm.
[59:26.440 --> 59:31.800]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise
[59:31.800 --> 59:32.800]  free speech.
[59:32.800 --> 59:38.320]  And the newest one is trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol
[59:38.320 --> 59:42.800]  of a trigger with a yield sign and then infowars.com on the back.
[59:42.800 --> 59:52.120]  That is the new shirt of the mind, available exclusively at infowars.com.
[59:52.120 --> 01:00:17.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:34.440]  Well, they're going through some of the final formalities of the bill, but this is a Trump,
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:40.720]  this is an America, this is a free market victory over the globalist, this is a backbreaker.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:46.000]  If they cannot kill Trump or keep him out of office and this tax cut goes in for a year,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.280]  the repeal of Obamacare is basically already happening by executive fiat because Obamacare
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.760]  gave the presidency executive fiat so the presidency can kill it.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:04.280]  They are a floundering, oily, disgusting, maggot mess right now, the globalist.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.320]  So this is huge.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.560]  You know, I remember, and I didn't catch this a couple of days ago when I saw the latest
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:18.640]  controversy about the people throwing fits that they have these animatronic kind of rubber
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:28.080]  wax figurines of the most prominent presidents at Disney and at Disneyland, Disney World,
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.880]  and people didn't like Trump being put there because they whined about everything, you
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.880]  bullies.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.600]  And I remember looking and going, man, that doesn't look like Trump.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.000]  It looks kind of weird, but it seems like I've seen that guy before.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.640]  Who is that?
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.680]  And I couldn't place it.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.600]  Well, guess what, folks?
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.240]  They did it.
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:54.640]  When you look at the side shot, it's, they took a morphing program guaranteed of Trump
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:02:00.840]  and Hillary as a sick joke and morphed the two.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.160]  And it kind of looks like John Voigt, then.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:12.480]  The article is up on infowars.com and newswars.com by the great Kit Daniels, Disney accused of
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.840]  putting Trump wig on Hillary animatronic.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.040]  Why does Trump animatronic look like Hillary?
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:22.880]  Well, you can see, because they use a 3D program to create these rubber masks anyways.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.880]  And then you can see it.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.960]  It's part Trump and it's part Hillary as a sick joke.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.920]  We got to look at the ears, though.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.120]  Let's actually go to the video.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.560]  It's on infowars.com.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.280]  It is?
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:39.200]  Oh my gosh, there is no end to these people.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.760]  They did a mix of Trump and Hillary.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760]  Wow.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:49.560]  Again, I thought, man, that doesn't look like Trump.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.760]  It looks like something I've seen before.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.160]  And some people joke and say it looked like John Voigt, because it looks a little bit
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.160]  like him, too.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.240]  It looks like I'm going to make sure Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and Voigt.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.840]  Disney built the animatronics for its Hall of Presidents exhibit at Walt Disney World,
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.360]  but just compare the animatronic to Clinton.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.240]  I tell you, that's how they sneak this stuff in.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.240]  And it just keeps coming out.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.400]  They put subliminal messages in, they put overt messages in.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.080]  It's plausible that Disney started work on the animatronic before the 2016 presidential
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.440]  election and expected Clinton to win.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.000]  That's a good point that speculators and can't make.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.520]  Maybe they just had that rubber mask of Hillary, so they put some different jowls on it, because
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520]  it's Hillary.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:46.000]  I mean, yeah, Newsweek already had it printed up that she was going to win, regardless the
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.920]  animatronic is such a poor replica of Trump that even left-wing MPR said it looks like
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920]  Hillary.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.920]  Yeah, I forgot that part.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.960]  See, I'm not even as smart as MPR.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.880]  I just saw that the other day in the video and I went, that doesn't look like Trump.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.760]  And some people joked it looked like Voigt, but when you really look, it looks like Hillary.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.200]  What on earth is going on here?
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.440]  Let's go out to break with some footage.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.760]  Well, you know, it's too delicious.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.840]  We just shot it on our iPhones yesterday.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.840]  I forget the name.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.880]  It's the regular Glock 9 millimeter, but full auto.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:21.880]  They're real rare.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.600]  I should probably look this up or call one of my gun guys, but the owner of the range
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.960]  brought his saw in and brought this Glock in, one of the fastest shooting, 6,000 rounds
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.200]  a minute handgun.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.960]  Very hard to get Glock, hard to even make some.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960]  And man, it was amazing.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.960]  And I got to say, they said I did pretty good.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.040]  There's a lot of folks who hardly even hit the target because it's just it's so wild
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]  and full of trigger.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.160]  But I got them all, got them all on target.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.720]  It was all over the place and fired them all in a second and a half.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.720]  We got slow-mo footage of that coming up and Dr. Group in studio.

[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:53.960]  Bye-bye.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:08:00.480]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com front-line report.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:05.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.960]  We now take you live.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:20.880]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:28.840]  We now take you to the United States of America in late 2017, when a renegade, nationalistic,
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:35.120]  pro-free market president against all odds, one year into his presidency, has taken control
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.800]  of the nation as restoring the Republic.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.120]  Rogue elements inside the government have struck back with manufactured frame-up propaganda,
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120]  and that has blown up in their face.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:51.320]  Now, historic, massive tax cuts guaranteed to supercharge the economy have passed.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.560]  Yes, they announced last night that it had passed, but they had to go through some formalities
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.720]  of a few areas of the bills that had to be lined up in the House and Senate, but under
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.520]  parliamentary rules, once it's already passed in general, you pledge that you will then
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.640]  vote for it as you voted before.
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.520]  That has now happened.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.520]  They are waiving some of the rules to fully merge the bills, and we're talking about the
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:19.320]  next hour or less, this going to the 45th President of the United States of America,
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.440]  Donald J. Trump.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.840]  All of our enemies that keep betting against us are just failing.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:31.120]  All the glory goes to God, to Jesus Christ's Son, and then the hard work to all of you
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.280]  putting up with being bullied, being attacked, being lied about, this amazing group, people
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.800]  like Dr. Group that have helped him forward so much, who's riding shotgun with us for
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.720]  the next two hours, and we're going to open the phones up on politics, on health, on so
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.720]  many issues.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:50.360]  This is an amazing time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen, but they've gone from being
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.600]  viciously angry when Trump won, to foaming at the mouth.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.920]  When he really is a libertarian, you look at the policies as what JFK's policies were,
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.600]  they have thrown everything out there, and now leftists are getting desperate.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.760]  I had a whole family last night when I went outside, my wife and a seven-month-old daughter
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:17.480]  were inside eating my other children, visiting with her mom right now, we're 50-50, we were
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:23.200]  80-20, but now it's 50-50, that's great, and my children are calling me, they want
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.000]  to talk to me, so I go outside, and I've got the footage.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.080]  I feel so sorry for folks, I don't know if I'm going to show it, but I think I'm going
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.600]  to need to go ahead and show it, probably today, but it's on my phone, I haven't downloaded
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.240]  it yet, and I'm just over here talking on the phone, and all of a sudden an old woman
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:42.360]  gets in my face and is doing the side of the cross, and the people are flipping me off,
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.680]  they all get around me, four men, two females, and they're going, you're going to president,
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.800]  you and Trump, you Russians, you know, you're a child molester, do you have sex with that
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.640]  baby inside, and I got to hang up on my daughters, I go, I'll call you back, click, and I turn
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.080]  around, I start taping it, and they're going, yeah, who's that hot young thing in there,
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:06.120]  yeah, she's a piece of crap you are, and they're all ganging up, and I just said, hey, I'm
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.680]  here, come on, and they kind of get scared, I'm like, yeah, you think I care, I'll walk
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.320]  over, I'll videotape both their cars, they got Hillary Clinton stickers on them, and
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.480]  I said, I'm going to show what you did, oh, how do you like the deputy pope having to step
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:23.800]  down from pedophilia, how do you like the head card, don't just now, you know, you're
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.280]  dying, it was all just grace, how do you like all the Hollywood stuff coming out, they are
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:33.480]  so angry about this, and they would come up and attack my baby, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.680]  I mean, it's who these people are, and they all want to be rich, yuppie types, they're
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:43.840]  getting in their fancy cars too, these limousine liberals, but you know, I just think we're
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.280]  going to play the footage of them, because, and I didn't even catch the really bad stuff,
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:52.640]  but I mean, and I shouldn't have called her the seahag, you know, I was a little bit mean,
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.840]  but you know, and her daughter comes over and says, leave my mother alone, they all
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.640]  gang up on me, and then when I don't really bow up, I just start speaking truth, they
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.240]  freak out, so I'm really worried because they keep saying they want to kill Trump, they've
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:10.840]  got these cabals, they're pushing it, again, Dr. Group, one of my good buddies, Global
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.960]  Healing Center, what do you think about the victories we're having, bringing sovereignty
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.840]  back, doesn't mean Trump's perfect, but bringing power back to the people, turning the economy
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.000]  around all this stuff, globally there's an awakening to globalism, there's huge things
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.720]  turning, and everywhere, the people that thought they were part of the system are getting very
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.720]  aggressive.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.840]  Now, I'm really glad to see everything happening the way that is happening, because we've been
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.800]  talking for a long time, you need to drain the swamp, you need to start looking at all
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.520]  of the areas that we're suffering, and you know, we are all suffering, I mean, we're
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.960]  giving our money to other countries, we're allowing other countries to come in, the healthcare
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.040]  system is a complete disaster, I mean, if they just took the money, you know, I know
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:55.360]  that the far left Democrats are complaining nonstop about this new tax bill, and oh, well,
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.120]  let's not look at the tax bill, let's look at the costs and all the deficit that we have
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.280]  in America.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.400]  All the trillions of dollars that are going to dine sys, and all of the black ops organizations
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.800]  through the Department of Defense that we're spending, that the CIA is hiring, the FBI
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:17.480]  is hiring, all the money that's going into the healthcare, we need to look at how to
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.080]  fix these situations by addressing the root cause of the problems.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.600]  Why are we having to spend trillions of dollars on heart disease and diabetes and all the
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.600]  other stuff that's happening?
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:32.840]  Well, I mean, it's deep state garbage, and Trump is exposing the deep state, and that's
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:37.120]  why it's so incredibly upset, and totally out of control right now, I mean, what are
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.400]  they really going to gripe about with the economy coming back?
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.560]  Well, they are upset, that's why they're trying to stop these tax cuts, exactly, four trillion
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.880]  overseas in corporate money that's now going to come back with this corporate tax bill.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.800]  Do people have any idea, they wrote laws to make it prohibitive, so no corporations will
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:53.800]  be based here?
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.160]  Why do you think they all left, because the globalists wrote the legislation 30 years
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.720]  ago to do it?
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.720]  We want to be able to do that, I mean, companies are taxed to the hill, that's why companies
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.720]  are moving outside of the United States.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.840]  We need to bring this back in, it is going to create jobs, I want to hire more people,
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:14.080]  I want to give back more to my employees.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.320]  I mean, you know, we are in a generation, even Harvard, MIT and some of these schools
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:23.440]  are now teaching how important it is to have that culture, and how important it is to take
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:28.520]  care of employees from years and years and years ago, I mean, we have a whole new mentality
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:33.360]  with these new individuals and these new cultures coming into the workforce, we're looking at
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:39.000]  AI technology, we're looking at the future where we might have robots replace workers,
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  what are we going to do in that situation?
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.480]  It's already happening, and we have to decide, we're going to buy products that are pro-human,
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.000]  we have to take control of the future now, the globalist technocrats want to take it
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.040]  away from us for total control, we have to realize that's happening, and Trump is a pro-human
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.080]  president who wants to make it about people and about workers, who lionizes blue collar
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.520]  workers instead of talking crap about them like Hillary does in the WikiLeaks, and I'm
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:08.440]  going to say this very clearly, if we had a 38.9%, that's what it was, corporate tax
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:14.720]  and China has a 15, communist China has a 15, which is a global average, a lot of companies
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:21.840]  have zero like Ireland, and they have, we have a 38.9, it's impossible, communists can't
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.480]  have taxes less than half of ours, and they go, Alex, you want rich guys to, what are
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480]  you making money off that?
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.880]  I don't take money outside of the country, we're going to come back and get into all

[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:00.480]  Not a group you develop living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.200]  Why is this so good?
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.680]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.520]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:17.240]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.560]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:25.640]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.920]  going on everywhere.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:27.920]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.600]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.920]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.240]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.240]  All right.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.400]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.560]  It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:50.360]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.760]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.880]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.800]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.800]  Go ahead.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.120]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.760]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:12.560]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.880]  And as a longtime infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.880]  Anthroplex.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.320]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320]  Thank you.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:26.320]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big normal
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320]  toothpaste fans.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.160]  The super blue is awesome.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.080]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the infowarslife products.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.280]  They are quality.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.240]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.960]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.960]  Absolutely.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960]  Absolutely.
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:45.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.560]  that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:20:00.440]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:08.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:38.240]  Okay, I promise to play this minute of video when we just shot it on our iPhones yesterday.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.080]  I thought, I've never taken Roger Stone's shooting.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.960]  We'll get to the serious stuff in the next segment.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.480]  And Roger's not a big shooter.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.480]  He's pro-second amendment.
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.480]  He's got a shotgun.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.480]  Ever been hunting?
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.640]  I'm going to take you hunting next.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:54.560]  Infowars.com contributor, former head of the Trump campaign, 2016 race.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.880]  But I took him out to the range, really nice shooting range.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.840]  In fact, it's the best in Texas, the biggest in Texas.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:01.840]  I think the nicest.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.080]  And the owner's a big listener and big patriot.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:08.960]  And we shot the Glock 18C and I never shot a saw.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:14.520]  But the Glock 18C is just a Glock handgun, nine millimeter.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:20.080]  It's got the port in the top, very rare, they're like $20,000 full auto and it's just a gun
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080]  to have fun with us.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:27.080]  It shoots 33 rounds in a second and a half, 1600 rounds a minute if you can feed them that
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.080]  fast.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.200]  And I'm very proud of myself.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:38.000]  Three out of four times I put, twice I put all the bullets on the target and then once
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.640]  the bunch of them was shot down at the bottom and then the other time they were all over
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.640]  the place.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.760]  But it is very hard to keep all the bullets on the target.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.560]  We've got the film, the footage shot in HD, we haven't had time to download it, so here's
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.240]  just the cell phone footage we shot.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.120]  For radio listeners, it's amazing, you can go to infowars.com, there's always live feeds
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.840]  and we'll upload this later, the footage.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:01.320]  But I've probably watched the slow motion footage, but he filmed it all four times.
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.680]  I just think Murphy's Law, the one really favorite one I did, I don't think made it
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:09.000]  on there, but it was like the cartridges were coming up perfectly and hitting the camera
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  where we'd set it.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:18.240]  It looks like a video game, it looks fake, it's not, here it is.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.120]  Cool.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.720]  And then in slow motion, there's no sound obviously.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:32.040]  It's weird how iPhones transfer on my phone when I play it in slow-mo, that's why I thought
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.840]  this footage was different.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.720]  It actually has it and it goes, it sounds amazing.
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720]  Nice tight grip.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.720]  I see you got the audio there.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.720]  It looks like you were pretty steady right there.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.720]  Let's look at it.
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.720]  Most of them hit the target.
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.720]  There's your saw.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.720]  There's your saw right there.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.720]  I used to shoot it.
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:59.720]  He was like, no, no, no, don't do it sing, it's not a sing, it's not a sing, no, no,
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.720]  no, do it like die, mother die.
[01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:04.720]  We didn't hold it.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.720]  Nice.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:11.200]  So we had hours of it, it was fun.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.120]  Never mind your Army days.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.640]  That does actually, it sure does.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.840]  When I was in the military, they were just coming out and launching the saw.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.600]  We were one of the first squads to do some testing with it.
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:29.120]  I ended up doing that for a while and then ended up going into becoming a dragon gunner
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:30.120]  after that.
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.120]  So a little bit of evidence.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.120]  A dragon gunner.
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.120]  Is that a C-130?
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.200]  No, a dragon gunner is actually a missile.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.000]  It's a large anti-tank weapon that you can actually carry with you.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:47.480]  It's a light, medium and heavy anti-tank or anti-armored vehicle missile, wire-guided.
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.760]  I'm sure they've come out with a lot of advancements.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:50.760]  So that's a missile?
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:51.760]  Yeah.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.760]  It is kind of like that.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.520]  So it's guided with the, with the, two man, three man team?
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.520]  No.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.520]  One man.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.520]  One guy, huh?
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.520]  One man.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.520]  I had to lug that thing around everywhere.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.520]  This big missile in my back.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.520]  Mm hmm.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520]  Was that fun?
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:05.520]  Yeah.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.520]  It was okay.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.520]  Was that bad?
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.520]  Yeah.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.520]  Not, not, not that bad at all.
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.520]  Let's talk about that.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:16.040]  So talking about military personnel, I mean, you know, because you told me long before
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.000]  you said, oh, there were shootouts all the time on the DMZ.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  And now we, you know, we hear about him, the guy trying to, you know, defect, they shoot
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  him five times.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  He still gets across.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.480]  Guys crawl over and get him and you can see the blood trails in the flare footage.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.480]  Pretty powerful footage.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:34.760]  And I guess that's where you were lugging the missile around on the DMZ on the DMZ.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:40.640]  We weren't using that missile because we didn't really have a threat of heavy tanks and artillery.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:46.040]  Mostly the North Korean army was just individual soldiers on the DMZ.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.600]  And the South Korean military was in front of us.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.200]  So on the patrols and everything, when the firefights happened mostly, and there were
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.360]  firefights every night, but that was in 1988 when North Korea was threatening to attack
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.920]  Seoul because of the Olympics were going to be in Seoul that year.
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.400]  And that's why we were sent over there.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.000]  That's about to happen again.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  Right.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  Yes, it is.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.240]  It repeats itself.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.240]  It sure does.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.240]  It sure does.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.360]  So, um, but anyway, yeah, I know it's a holiday season.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:17.160]  I know a lot of people have questions about how to stay healthy during the holidays.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:23.160]  Um, the, there have been a lot of reports that there are the flu is really, really bad.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.400]  We're going to get to that next segment.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.400]  Let's get back to our three.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.960]  Give us some army stories about the shootouts with the North Koreans.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:29.720]  Well, we didn't see a lot of them.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:34.920]  I'll tell you the, the, the story that affected most of us was the fact that they were using,
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:40.080]  uh, doing the psychological, uh, scyat programs back in the, uh, 80s and they were testing
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:46.480]  them out on us and they built a whole city right there on the border and they would play
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.880]  loud, loud, loud music every single night and they were doing a propaganda, dropping
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.240]  propaganda documents on us as well.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.720]  But the music, I remember around Christmas time and they would blast Christmas carols
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.200]  and Christmas songs all night long because they wanted us to not be able to sleep or
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200]  anything like that.
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:07.640]  And they wanted us to become sad that we missed our families and stuff.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:13.040]  So it's like mainstream media bombages against America, Trump, libertarianism, free market.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040]  It's kind of the same thing.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.320]  Oh, psychological warfare.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.000]  They were using on us back then.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.720]  So, so that was the big thing.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.960]  I mean, it was like Rudolph, the red nose, reindeer, blaring loud and we could literally
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.520]  see the North Korean flag from looking out of our, uh, our bedroom where we were staying
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.520]  our barracks.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.520]  We were that close.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:35.720]  We were in the first of the 506 at Camp Grieves unless the northern most post either to back
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:36.720]  up the South Koreans.
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:38.000]  It was mainly them having the shootouts.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  Yeah.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.080]  We trained a lot with the South Koreans.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.640]  We trained with 10th Mountain.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:52.080]  I mean, all of the, the Green Berets and the Rangers and even Delta Force and Navy Seals,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:59.480]  Air Force, different types of military, I always ask myself the question, why was there
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:05.400]  so many different military soldiers from different countries there all the time training with
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.400]  us?
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:12.200]  I mean, we would have sometimes Russian military, Afghanistan, I mean, everywhere you could
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.600]  imagine they were sending soldiers in to train with us and we were always asking, why are
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.800]  we training these guys?
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:25.160]  We might be in war with them, but they're, you know, part of our training for, I mean,
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:30.000]  we had no idea what was going on, but that's, that was part of the, the training operations
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  over there.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.960]  But I learned a lot and some of the technology that they introduced us to back then, I remember
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.320]  them bringing, bringing us down into a little cave in 1988.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.560]  This was before cell phones.
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:49.680]  This was an 80, yeah, an 87, 88, and the technology that they introduced us to down
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.480]  there was, was pretty amazing.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:56.640]  Just small, even little devices this big that in 1988, it was almost AI, we could, we could
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:01.360]  call anywhere in the world with these like, like, wasn't even a satellite phone, it was
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:06.280]  more like a pager, it was just a square rectangular system where it was a tracking device.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.280]  They could track where we are.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:13.040]  They could listen to us and we could actually use that to call anybody, we could imagine
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.600]  the stuff they've given us now through the phones is nothing.
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.680]  They say the tech's like 20, 30 years ahead.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:25.520]  Oh, there was laser technology back then, there was, you know, I mean, I can remember
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.580]  looking at some of the stuff down in that bunker and just thinking, wow, this is pretty
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.080]  amazing stuff.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:36.320]  It looked like something out of a sci-fi movie, basically the secret space program kind of
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.320]  stuff.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.320]  I mean, that we've had.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.320]  She won't tell us, by the way.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.320]  We're not allowed to.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:46.120]  Uh, I don't know a lot about it, but I know that I've been given some documents about
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:49.960]  some, um, we'll talk about that in the next segment, though, and you could pull that stuff
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:55.320]  up on, on YouTube about some holographic healing technology that the military said.
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.320]  Hey, we gotta go break.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.820]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680]  coming up.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.880]  They have passed the historic tax bill.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:43.600]  They had a few little incidentals but it has now officially passed.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.920]  Trump is set to have a press conference soon.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.440]  We are watching this very, very closely.

[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:11.080]  But before we go any further, again, Epic Overhaul sent to President's Desk lowers taxes,
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:17.600]  repeals Obamacare mandate, allows oil drilling, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:25.320]  So there you go, huge information upon DrudgeReport.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:28.440]  And again, people say, oh my God, this will hurt the earth, whatever.
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.920]  They're drilling and exploring everywhere else except America.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.840]  We've been artificially shut down.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.440]  That's the globalist plan.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.440]  It's a done deal.
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.600]  Congress wraps up massive tax package.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:43.360]  Now, I want to get into flu season, into the flu shot, into all the vaccines.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:48.000]  We have people that work here, two people in the last six months that I know.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.960]  One on that side of the building, one in here, who are going out of the country.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.480]  They told them, take all these shots.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.480]  One of them got really sick.
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.680]  One of them got super sick.
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.740]  And they told her, you can't ever take a vaccine again.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:02.480]  It may cause an allergic reaction that kills you.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.560]  And just like you can say, I can't take peanuts or I can't eat eggs or milk or whatever, you
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.360]  get deathly ill or bee sting.
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.360]  What about vaccines?
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  They're all different companies.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.720]  They're growing on fetal tissue.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.720]  They're growing on eggs.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:17.840]  If they're originally grown on egg stock, they supposedly strain that out and then transfer
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:18.840]  it over.
[01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.560]  But the virus still has those ring structure protein cofactors.
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.560]  I'm no scientist.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.560]  I've read the reports.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.480]  You've got a big thing on that.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:31.320]  And then they admit the Canadian study of six years ago, every flu shot you take doubles
[01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:32.840]  your chances of flu the next year.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:38.560]  They've never guessed the right flu strain for the next year's mutation.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:43.440]  It's a giant, giant, giant, giant hoax.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.440]  It's just incredible.
[01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:51.280]  So you've got a lot of news on that and natural, healthy ways for people to avoid the flu.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:52.280]  Let me guess.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.280]  Dr. Ripp, tell me.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.600]  Well, first of all, just to address your previous comment about the oil drilling and
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:04.520]  I know a lot of people aren't happy about it and the disbanding of all the EPA and stuff
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.520]  like that.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:12.080]  I personally know that people around the world are working right now on different types of
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.080]  energy devices.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.160]  And even the big companies are working on generating energy from blue, green algae and
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.280]  other sources that are natural.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.880]  So I think that you're going to see a lot.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:25.360]  I actually saw some things come across my desk in the last couple of weeks that are
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:29.840]  amazing, using hydrogen, creating energy from air, water.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.840]  It's a huge movement.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.040]  By the way, Trump's been blocking all that too.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.240]  Not just a few windmill boondoggles, but the real technology because all kinds of people
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.040]  all over the world now are starting to come out and they're saying we're sick of all the
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.200]  damage to the earth.
[01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.680]  We want to get clean energy.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.400]  We want to have different ways and it's been blocked.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:52.160]  On every front, Alex, like the pharmaceutical industry right now is buying up all kinds
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.400]  of nutraceutical agencies.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:58.440]  They just ended up buying Garden of Life and atrium nutraceuticals for some billions
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:01.440]  of dollars and we get offered all the time too.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.560]  So there's many different things that are happening on every front that I think are
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.840]  all positive.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:09.560]  The oil and gas industry, yeah, there's a lot of money in the oil and gas industry,
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:14.320]  but the oil and gas industry is also looking at risk assessments and doing swat analysis
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.320]  and all kinds of stuff.
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:20.480]  And they're seeing all these genius kids, there's a 13-year-old kid that made the news
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:26.240]  that they're saying is the next Nikolai Tesla out there that's developing a way to generate
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.600]  energy that to power things for a very, very, very low cost.
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.080]  So we have a collective effort that's happening all over the world right now.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.560]  I think there's a collective effort for nationalism and rebirth and renaissance.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.200]  There's a collective jump happening that the globalist knew was coming and tried to block
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.240]  with the fluoride, the aspartame and all of it.
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:56.000]  There's advancements in natural means to regrow limbs right now using holographic images.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.320]  To look inside the body, I mean, we're exponentially with technology and AI and robotics.
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:03.920]  Talk about it in his inaugural speech.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:06.520]  He said, we know we've been suppressing technology.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:10.120]  We're going to turn loose and we're going to discover the secrets of the universe together.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.120]  Yes.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:14.640]  And then, so people are to lean into the whole flu thing.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.600]  I mean, the pharmaceutical companies know that the money is so good in the flu shots
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:23.560]  and it used to be a flu shot once a year that you were getting, but now you're getting
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:29.440]  off or $10 off your grocery store bill or your drugstore bill if you get a flu shot.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.320]  And now you're saying you need multiple ones and people are getting MMR, measles, bumps
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.800]  or bellows who've had the shot.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.720]  They admit that's actually what's spreading it.
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:41.320]  I mean, it's just crazy how they're firing all these nurses, giving them depremies that
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:42.320]  they admit kills them.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:45.040]  I mean, they're really trying to force inoculate right now.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.040]  Yeah.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.040]  CVC, I brought an article.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:52.080]  CV, I mean, I'm sorry, CVS ran out of flu shots for people under 65.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:57.080]  You have damaging effects of flu all over the nation right now.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:00.440]  Flu is now widespread in New York and California for the first time this season.
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.440]  Now they've got studies.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.920]  The more people take the shot, the more it spreads.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:09.560]  That's true because the influenza virus replicates, every time it replicates, it replicates into
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:10.560]  a new virus.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:15.080]  So it's literally impossible to develop a flu vaccine.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.880]  I keep telling people that over and over and over again, listen.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:21.480]  Let's talk about what do you do health wise, knock on wood.
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.200]  I get allergies and that's about it.
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.480]  I have not had the flu in 10 years.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.760]  I don't even get sore throats anymore.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.760]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:36.000]  I mean, I take the supplements, but I'm still eat like a pig, exercise some.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.840]  But I mean, it's kind of, in fact, my wife's like, she's done me four years.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:39.840]  She's like, you never get sick.
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:40.840]  What's going on here?
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:45.400]  Well, the main thing is to keep your immune system strong and you do that through a lot
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:47.040]  of different things.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.560]  Sleep number one, a lot of people aren't getting enough sleep.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.520]  And even during the holidays, people are not getting enough sleep.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.960]  That's one of my biggest holiday tips.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:59.320]  Just try to get an extra two hours of sleep every single night during the holidays and
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.160]  you'll feel so much better because people overeat.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:07.520]  And you look at the things that what's going to decrease my immune system, especially during
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:08.920]  the winter, you have
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.320]  Let's not ask you because I haven't plugged any of the shower and we do sell great products
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:16.200]  that you and others have developed that are best sellers that people take and love and
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.200]  help them.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.680]  But I think it's the fact that I've been taking X2 for four years, the true clean, pure iodine,
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.760]  the good halogen, the fact that I take vitamin B12 every two days during the winter, I take
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.280]  our winter sun.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.440]  And I mean, again, people ask some people out of there are super sick.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.120]  I go, dude, you're like, why does it go?
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.120]  Go get some sun.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.120]  They go, it's crazy.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.960]  I had all these skin rashes and stuff and I went and got sun and now I'm gaining weight
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.240]  and I don't have skin rashes.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:45.440]  It's like, we're just water, clean water, sleep, sunlight.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.000]  But then vitamin D three, yes, winter sun, winter sun is one of the, one of the things
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.440]  that people have noticed tremendous benefits from over the years.
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.800]  Oh, you notice BuzzFeed did the analysis, tested it, said it was totally clean.
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:01.280]  But then said, Oh, but this other one is even better.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.960]  And then it was your group that we're private labeling.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.640]  So, so, so they said, here's the very best, not knowing is what we private label from
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.640]  you.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.840]  What I love about the hilarious, that's, that's hilarious.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.880]  So we've tested hundreds and here's the best.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:17.360]  So oregano oil, silver is really good to keep with you over the holidays.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:22.440]  And most importantly, a good enzyme product like you just launched, as well as a good
[01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:23.440]  probiotic.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.800]  And the reason why is what we were talking about all the excess meat, people usually
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:31.600]  gain on average one to five pounds over the holidays and then they feel horrible come
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.600]  January.
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:39.760]  So take the carnivore, enzyme, a good, a good probiotic, winter sun, the iodine.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.240]  I've looked at, at analyzing the different foods over the holidays and a lot of them
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.760]  contain fluoride, bromine and chlorine, a lot of water and that's, you know, the good
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:54.680]  thing about X2 and the iodine is that what else are you going to use to clean out the
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.560]  harmful halogens for your body?
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.680]  As patriots, we don't think of ourselves as sissy.
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:03.040]  So we ignore all this, but I didn't get sick a lot before, but I'm not kidding.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.120]  I mean, I literally knock on wood.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:06.720]  I hate every time I say this, it'll happen.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.480]  I mean, I never even get fevers anymore.
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.840]  It's like insane.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.280]  Well, that's because your body is utilizing the nutrients that you have, the high end
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.280]  nutrients to keep you.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.760]  Why am I still getting allergies though?
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:22.280]  Well, we're all having allergies right now because of all the things that they're spraying
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:23.280]  in the air.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:28.400]  I mean, when you have shifts from cold air to hot air and you're going in and out of
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:33.840]  different types of buildings and indoor air is, is now a hundred times more, can be up
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.140]  to a hundred times more toxic than outdoor air.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:43.320]  We're seeing a massive pesticide fungus and mold and yeast that's getting up into the
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.320]  sinuses.
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.320]  Let's talk about that first.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.020]  And then I want to get into Trump and Aspartame, even amidst his garbage, but he drinks 12
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:50.020]  cokes a day.
[01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:52.200]  Dr. Grips, our guest, the big tax bill passed.

[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:02.360]  The House passed a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax bill Tuesday, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.240]  lowers individual tax rates.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:09.440]  Paul Ryan said, Today we are giving the people their money back, adding that a typical family
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:13.800]  would average about $2,000 in tax cuts in 2018.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:16.960]  Zero Democrats voted to lower taxes.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.040]  Instead they were busy pushing the narrative that the sloppy bill is a Frankenmonster set
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:25.840]  to benefit only corporations and the rich, but are they really just worried about a legislative
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.800]  accomplishment that will translate to more cold hard cash for middle class pockets?
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:38.520]  According to the Independent Tax Policy Center, 80% of taxpayers will get a tax cut in 2018.
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:42.840]  Only about 5% will pay more next year under the GOP plan.
[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:47.360]  With approval from both chambers likely, the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system in
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:52.960]  more than 30 years could be signed into law by President Trump before the end of the week.
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:57.640]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, infowars.com.
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:58.640]  I'm so excited.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:04.240]  The new product at infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.800]  brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red bill.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:14.240]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:17.200]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:23.560]  Boy, frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:30.160]  it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae, and I came
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.360]  up with our own formulae working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:41.760]  America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglenone to it, which is the
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:46.600]  precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.600]  glands.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.440]  It is amazing.

[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:24.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:44.800]  So, the truth about Diet Coke is it's very simple to discover.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:49.120]  We've got Dr. Gripper with us, I've had Dr. Russell Blalock on countless times who created
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:52.560]  the term excitotoxin more than 25 years ago in major literature.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:58.400]  It's now a dominant term, and excitotoxins are addictive poisons that make you want to
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:03.680]  have more of them and that have an excitotoxin effect in your body.
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.280]  And that's why I remember having Blalock on 20 years ago, and he would say, it makes
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:12.000]  you crave more food, it makes you eat more sweets, he would give the studies, it makes
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000]  you more obese.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.200]  I remember a group coming on and talking about it 10 years ago, and so now it's mainstream
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:25.320]  news that, oh, diet soda with aspartame makes you fatter, and Trump back in 2012 showing
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:31.160]  how smart he is said, I know this stuff makes you fatter, you never see a skinny person drinking
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.160]  it.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.640]  He said, you know, when you do drink it, it makes you more hungry, but I still drink a
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:36.640]  lot of the garbage.
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:37.640]  Here it is.
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.160]  I've never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.680]  Good job, crew, pulling that up so fast.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:45.520]  The Coca-Cola Company is not happy with me, that's okay.
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:49.640]  I still keep drinking that garbage, and then he said he does drink quite a few a day.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:53.480]  The New York Times claims 12, so it's true when the producer corrected me that Trump
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:59.600]  never said 12, that's probably fake news, but Dr. Group, they now admit what you and
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:05.600]  others said about this, give us a snapshot of Diet Coke, and we always say Diet Coke,
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.640]  aspartame, because now it's in all the major sugar gums, it's in stuff that doesn't say
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.640]  sugar-free.
[01:49:10.640 --> 01:49:14.480]  My kids go to the grocery store, they want some bubble gum, I had to order it online.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:16.920]  I can't even find it.
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:27.000]  I mean, the FDA has the most phone calls and adverse events listed from aspartame, artificial
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.600]  sweeteners, Splenda, all of those different types of artificial sweeteners than any other
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.200]  drug or natural substance.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.080]  I'm not even going to say it's natural substance.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:42.880]  I mean, it is developed as an artificial sweetener, just as bad as all of the other things out
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:43.880]  there.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:45.760]  It's extremely toxic to the brain.
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:48.640]  My aunt died of brain cancer.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:55.240]  She drank 12 tabs a day, and she was a dean of nursing at Syracuse University.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:56.240]  Let's explain why.
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.080]  My mother tries to quit and has to lay in bed for three days, and she's tough.
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.120]  She's finally pretty much gotten off of it, but occasionally like a drinker goes back
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:04.120]  to it.
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:05.440]  I mean, it's wood alcohol, right?
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.720]  Well, a lot of things can happen in the body.
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:12.160]  It actually converts to formaldehyde at about 88 degrees, and not only that, it's very
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.160]  acidic.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:18.320]  And what people don't know about it that I keep saying is, it reacts differently with
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:23.720]  heavy metals, and those molecules of aspartame react differently in different pH environments.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:29.040]  So let's say you have the standard American diet, where someone's eating a steak, baked
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:32.880]  potato, diet drinks, and dessert.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.880]  Well, you're going to have different chemicals in all of those things.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.920]  Like you said, a lot of the desserts these days are made with artificial sweeteners,
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:47.600]  and then you add other excitotoxins, like MSG, and you add blue, red, yellow, green,
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.600]  dyes.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.440]  And once you've gotten addicted, like Colonel Sanders got it from the Japanese in World
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.280]  War I, the Japanese like good food.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.280]  They couldn't make them eat canned food.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:51:00.160]  They put aspartame in an excitotoxin, or not aspartame, they put MSG in, and then he came
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.840]  and put it in Colonel Sanders' chicken.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.440]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:10.320]  It's all done by design, and the flavoring industry is a huge, huge, huge industry.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:15.320]  And it's not only flavoring industry, it's addiction industry.
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:21.920]  We have a society that's become addicted to sugar, addicted to artificial sugar, addicted
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.640]  to food in general, addicted to meat, carbohydrates, everything else.
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:31.320]  And so we're overeating to the point where I was just reading some studies that said,
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:35.720]  and these are some doctors that were working and studying this back in the 1920s to the
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:42.880]  1950s, one meal a day, Alex, like one standard fast-feed food meal a day can take 100, up
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:47.640]  between 90 to 100% of your energy levels in your body to break down that one food meal.
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.720]  That's why we're so exhausted, because it's not just the calories, it's what's in it.
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.920]  And I remember reading about KFC and all these pioneers of it, and the McDonald's later,
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:00.560]  they were in races with other companies, like cigarette makers, to make their food more
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:01.840]  addictive.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:05.320]  They want you coming back and buying it over and over and over again.
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.800]  Obama gets in and I go, well, whether they're going to have a lunch program, it'll be like
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:10.280]  old-fashioned liberals really making it healthy and organic.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.280]  No.
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:16.600]  It's all about lower calorie, no fat the brain needs, and pure aspartame MSG as chemicalized
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:20.760]  as possible, worse than prison food, but it was okay because he's liberal.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:25.840]  All we need is an executive order, we know that artificial sweeteners are toxic, there's
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:31.720]  plenty of scientific evidence, executive order, ban artificial sweeteners, ban the
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:37.720]  use of pesticides, ban the use of preservatives, toxic preservatives, ban all these man-made
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.720]  chemicals.
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:39.720]  What is that headline?
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:40.720]  Which companies are eating aborted fetuses in their food?
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:41.720]  Isn't it?
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:48.560]  Well, that's, yeah, who knows what, see, here's another thing, foods are not tested for all
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:49.560]  these different chemicals.
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:52.720]  Oh, remember Pepsi said they stopped using the fetal tissue as their ancestor.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:59.560]  Yes, for the, they even found traces of it in their Aquafina water products.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:04.240]  But not only are you looking at the diet drinks like Diet Coke, but what are the other things
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.240]  that are in there?
[01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:10.240]  It's not just the artificial sweeteners, there's toxic colorings in there, the water that they're
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:19.160]  using, when is the last time a consumer took any artificial drink out there and did a full
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:24.120]  analysis on it to check for pesticide residue, endocrine disrupting chemicals, which are
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:25.120]  causing it.
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:26.120]  We're going to cover all that in the next hour.
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:31.600]  Bottom line, there is an insane mad scientist race with human animal chimeras and weird
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:34.000]  toxic flavorings, and all of this is addictive.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.120]  And once you start eating fast food, I've done it before, I used to be, you know, be
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:41.160]  exercising all the time and stuff, but then started eating fast food and quit exercising.
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:42.160]  It's like a drug.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:43.160]  Now you crave it.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.160]  You feel horrible till you get it, and two hours later you're back there eating it, but
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:49.960]  you eat a good, clean meal, you're not hungry for six hours, and it's not that I'm some
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:53.360]  rocket scientist and I'm the highest example of living perfectly.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:56.240]  I'm just saying, I've been through it, I've experienced it myself.
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:01.160]  I need to plug here, and you were hearing, you said, listen, the biggest thing is funguses.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:05.440]  I won't talk about funguses, how they're spreading, why are they mutating, why is it
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.840]  yeast and mold getting so bad?
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.920]  And you said, by the way, I never hear you pitching my COZX, and I said, well, that's
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.000]  because for six months it's been sold out because you've been unable to source all the
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.720]  incredible ingredients and get it, the ultimate, if you talk about probiotic, Michael ZX cuts
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:23.560]  out all the garbage and actually targets the yeast, the candida, the mold in your gut
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:28.000]  because normal probiotics will displace the bad bacteria, but they won't get rid of the
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:33.520]  yeast mold, and as you've said, Michael ZX is now back in stock with free shipping, discounted,
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:36.000]  even though it's been sold out for what, six months?
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.640]  Why did it take you so long to be able to produce more of this for us?
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:43.040]  Well we're constantly looking at ways to improve and we're going to be coming out.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.080]  You're always trying to have a very, cleanest, organic, absolutely bad.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:50.840]  And this is one of the things, I mean, people say, well, why are your supplements so expensive?
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.440]  Well, if I'm going to buy, I can buy milk thistle for $2 a pound from China, it's been
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:01.680]  sitting in a warehouse, but we have specific, our philosophy is from seed to your body.
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:03.880]  That's how, that's the quality control that we use.
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:07.480]  But by the way, that's not that expensive, they have cruddy probiotics and antifungals
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:09.720]  that are more than yours.
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:17.440]  So with our, so it all comes down to the therapeutic level and effectiveness of all of the constituents
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.440]  in each individual.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:19.440]  How a lot it is.
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.440]  Okay.
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:23.760]  Well, we're finding out now, Alex, we just finished reviewing research studies that came
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:29.600]  out of India on the spice industry, and we're finding in the milling process, when they
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:33.160]  take the herbs, no matter what it is, and they mill them because they have to produce
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:34.160]  them into a powder.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.160]  It heats them up.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:38.480]  It heats them up and they have to go through the mill four or five times sometimes to get
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.520]  to a certain powdered mesh size.
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:46.480]  We found out, and this is, this is scientific evidence that you lose 50% or more of the
[01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:50.280]  active constituents in the milling process alone.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.680]  That means you use the essential oils.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:52.680]  It's not fresh.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:55.920]  I mean, just to dumb it down, a piece of meat that's a six months old frozen, doesn't
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:56.920]  taste like one fresh.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.880]  So it doesn't have the same stuff.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.800]  Well, anyways, my code is back infowarstore.com.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:05.600]  You can still order it in the lower 48 and get it before Christmas.
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.440]  Michael's EX, Santa delivered that a little early, we'll say Christmas, Christmas, Christmas,
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.440]  Jesus Christ.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:13.600]  That makes all the globalists angry to say Christmas, or Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:18.760]  But Michael's EX is now back in stock, and it's amazing when it's done for some of the
[01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:22.200]  people that I've known that have had serious bowel disorders, you name it, this has changed
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.200]  their lives.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:27.840]  If I've been so upset, we can't get more of it, but now it's finally back infowarstore.com,
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:28.840]  free shipping.
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:33.320]  We have 50% off on most items, 67% off on colloidal silver, and your purchase helps
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:37.920]  fund this news and information warfare operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:38.920]  Go ahead and finish it up.
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:42.640]  No, if you're suffering from, I mean, it's just something that's so, so, so common right
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:43.640]  now.
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:47.360]  I could literally probably take nine out of 10 people off the street, test their sinuses.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:52.040]  That's why everybody has these chronic sinus problems, congestion, their nose is always
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.040]  running.
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.680]  It's, we are living in a time and every single day, more and more and more people are suffering
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:03.240]  from an overgrowth of mold, fungus, and yeast inside their body.
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:05.800]  Scientists are starting to recognize that as well.
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:11.120]  And it's something that everybody, including children these days, they're not being diagnosed
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:14.280]  from their physicians and they're being put on antibiotics and they're being put on all
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.280]  these.
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:16.280]  When we come back, why?
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:21.360]  Because even mainstream news admits molds, funguses, all of it is exploding.
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:26.880]  It's killing the animals, the deer, the, the, the, the coyotes, the humans.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.160]  People are getting brain tumors in their heads.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.600]  I see that are fungus growing.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:32.480]  It's getting in the houses, the black mold.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.800]  Why is it exploding?
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.480]  Why is it growing straight ahead that will recap some of the other big news?
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:38.480]  Open the phones up.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:42.640]  Your chance to talk to Dr. Edward Group, I'm Alan Jones, newswars.com.

[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:31.960]  All right, I've been ranting, I've been raving.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:35.280]  We've got Dr. Griffin here for this hour, someone to the next.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:39.440]  Give people in this little segment a smattering of what you want to cover, what's coming up,
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.280]  and then I'm going to give the toll free number out, and you're welcome to call with
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:48.000]  any questions, any comments, any reviews of the products, any questions, 877-789-ALAKS,
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:56.400]  877-789-2539 is the toll free number to join us on Wednesday, the 20th of December, 2017.
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:00.560]  I'm very thankful this year for all of you, thankful for the big tax cuts that are giving
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.480]  so much to our country that the globalists are so upset about, we're going to be breaking
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.480]  that down.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.240]  And how long till Trump's press conference, do we know?
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:10.240]  We are.
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.240]  We're okay.
[02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:12.240]  Good.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:16.720]  We're watching that all very, very closely, could be any time now.
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:18.720]  So that is coming up.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.680]  So again, 877-789-ALAKS is the number, Dr. Group, give us a smattering of what's coming
[02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:24.680]  up.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:29.280]  Well, I mean, it's been a long time since I've been able to answer questions for everybody,
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.560]  and I know everybody loves to call in and ask about things, current events, current things
[02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:38.280]  that are happening in the health field arena, what they can do to improve their health,
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.960]  how the products work.
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:45.960]  So I'm really excited about taking some calls, but we can go over some holiday tips, what
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:49.360]  you can do during the holidays to keep yourself healthy, some of the things that are going
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:53.800]  to be popping up next year, hopefully some good things.
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:59.160]  Why it's so important to keep yourself detoxified and why it's so important to really take control
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:04.520]  of your own health and to focus on yourself and your family and to learn as much as you
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:05.520]  possibly can.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:12.040]  It really all comes down to one simple thing, and that your body always gives you the signs
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:16.480]  that something's going on just to pay attention to those signs and slowly change.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:21.480]  I mean, you don't have to completely eliminate everything that you like to do inside your
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:28.520]  life or inside your home, but it comes down to evaluating your environment, your diet,
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:34.200]  where you live, cleaning up the home, getting rid of the chemicals, cleaning up your body,
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:35.980]  making sure that you detoxify.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:41.680]  That's why it's so important that the products we initially launched here were really focused
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:47.380]  on gut health, detoxifying, especially during the holidays when you have all that garbage
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:49.200]  inside your system and you want to get it.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:56.360]  All I know is I take your products and I haven't been sick other than allergies in four years.
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:01.280]  You know a good product right now, Lung Cleanse, is a product that we launched that's becoming
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:03.200]  more and more and more popular.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:09.160]  It was designed to work as an antihistamine for allergies.
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:14.120]  We have a few allergies now that are coming into play, I think Red Cedar, but it is amazing
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:18.280]  the response that we're getting because of all of these sore throats and all of these
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:19.280]  respiratory issues.
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:22.940]  This didn't like the stuff where it's real thin and it's like two ingredients and alcohol.
[02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:26.120]  This is dozens of concentrated essential oils.
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:28.560]  This is an essential oil concentrate.
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:30.760]  It's not necessarily an essential oil concentrate.
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:34.080]  All I know is I'm reading the back, it just has all my names in these oils.
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:35.080]  Right, right, right.
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:37.880]  And that's important because those oils go down into your lungs.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:42.840]  I've literally had moms call me up and say their kids were coughing or had went into
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.280]  different types of allergic reactions and that product has saved their life.
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:52.640]  And the reason why I'm bringing it up over the holidays is, you know, families come together.
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:53.640]  Here's what happens.
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:58.640]  They go through the airports, they all fly on planes, they don't wash their hands.
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:04.320]  So you spread these different types of flu viruses and people aren't getting sun.
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:06.080]  They're not getting vitamin D3.
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:07.400]  They're eating too much.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:08.680]  Their immune systems are down.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:12.600]  They come home for the holidays and then, you know, you're supposed to be happy with
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:17.560]  your family and not stressed out and they bring something in and the kids get sick.
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:21.040]  It's a giant petri dish incubator and I want to be clear.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:27.040]  I haven't gotten like a cold or the flu in like four years or anything with a fever.
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:30.880]  I have had things like little sore throats or when I had a tooth from grinding my teeth
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:36.200]  and my sleep break off, that got a little infected and then antibiotics didn't work,
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.200]  the colloidal silver worked.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:40.920]  I mean, it's like, I mean, but when it comes to everybody else who gets sick around me,
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:41.920]  I'm just like, no.
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:47.440]  I still don't understand why they prescribe antibiotics for the flu sometimes.
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.440]  That's crazy.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.440]  But yeah, a lot of that.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.440]  They know full well.
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:51.440]  I mean, yeah.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:52.440]  I'm on a rocket.
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:53.960]  Antibiotics are for bacteria.
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:55.400]  Oxipowder keeps your intestines clean.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:59.800]  The House passed a sweeping $1.5 trillion tax bill Tuesday.
[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:03.560]  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowers individual tax rates.
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:08.840]  Paul Ryan said, today we are giving the people their money back, adding that a typical family
[02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:13.120]  would average about $2,000 in tax cuts in 2018.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:15.960]  Zero Democrats voted to lower taxes.
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:20.080]  Instead, they were busy pushing the narrative that the sloppy bill is a Franken monster
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:24.480]  set to benefit only corporations and the rich, but are they really just worried about
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:30.200]  a legislative accomplishment that will translate to more cold, hard cash for middle class pockets?
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:37.880]  According to the Independent Tax Policy Center, 80% of taxpayers will get a tax cut in 2018.
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:42.200]  Only about 5% will pay more next year under the GOP plan.
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:46.720]  With approval from both chambers likely, the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system in
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:52.360]  more than 30 years could be signed into law by President Trump before the end of the week.
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:54.920]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, Infowars.com
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:25.640]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:30.280]  Dr. Edward Group is writing shotgun with us today as we banter back and forth, covering
[02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:34.760]  health news, information, important things, but we're going to interspersed this with
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:38.720]  the big press conference coming up that should happen next 30 minutes to an hour.
[02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:47.120]  They are busing Congress, people that voted for this historic tax cut plan, this reindustrialization,
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:53.000]  just bringing the money back to America plan to the White House for a big press conference.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.480]  Sometime in the next hour, hour and a half, we're not sure they've not announced that,
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:03.360]  but the big attacks are it allows oil drilling or pipelines in the Arctic, you know, Alaska
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.960]  wildlife refuge.
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:10.000]  They put that in to kill the pipelines when Obama got in.
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.120]  The caribou sleep underneath it.
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:14.560]  It's a big pipeline.
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:17.640]  Everybody else, you know, China has 97% of rare as minerals.
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:18.640]  They're mining everywhere.
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:19.640]  They're doing everything.
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:20.640]  Oh, that's okay.
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:25.400]  But we can't have anything in America if you drive a car or if you're wearing nylon clothing
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:29.440]  or you're involved in any of this, you have to understand that's the energy we got.
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.520]  We're using it.
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:32.600]  The globalists have deindustrialized this country.
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:33.600]  We're going to have it.
[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:39.760]  I'm all for the new technologies come forward, but Trump's doing what he said, but the no-brainer
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:45.280]  is a 40% or 38.9 corporate tax.
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:46.780]  China has a 15.
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:49.880]  Why do you think everybody moved to China or zero?
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:51.560]  Ireland was falling apart 20 years ago.
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.560]  They went to zero.
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:55.080]  They became the boom town.
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:56.520]  So you got 4 trillion outside the country.
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:57.840]  It's about to come back in.
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:02.760]  If you think a 3.3 growth rates good, they're talking about just the tax cut alone, not
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:03.760]  the corporate one.
[02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:05.520]  The other one will make it 7% to 10.
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:09.720]  They're saying the corporate tax, the only problem is it's going to create such a boom
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:12.920]  unless they're able to somehow sabotage the stock market before it fully gets in.
[02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:13.920]  Here's the critical time about the ribbon.
[02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:14.920]  I want your take on this.
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:15.920]  You're a smart businessman as well.
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:19.000]  Of course, your dad's a famous chemist.
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.400]  You've studied this a lot.
[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:26.000]  If this tax cut actually gets deployed before they repeal it, before they can plunge the
[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.200]  stock market, before they can block everything with a civil war or a bigger war in career,
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.480]  whatever, if this plan goes through and the whole thing turns around and we're in a giant
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:39.520]  boom time, what do the globalists then do to counter nationalism?
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:44.880]  A, but B, let's face it, prosperity creates a lot of slobs as well.
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:49.040]  That's kind of the downside of it.
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:52.960]  If you really pull back, it'll also probably create some pretty serious inflation as we
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:54.320]  still have big debts.
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:58.840]  If we don't free-spending and start paying down debt, then we're just going in the same
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:08:59.840]  direction.
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:06.640]  Well, again, I would say address the root cause of the situation that we're in anyway
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:13.960]  with why are we paying so much taxes and why are we spending so much money in government
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:16.520]  and why is our government so big?
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:20.680]  It's not run like an organization or like a company, and that's the good thing about
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:25.880]  Trump is that he actually is bringing that business knowledge into a government that,
[02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:31.120]  you know, look at how many people in government are trained in business.
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:35.880]  How many people in government have run a corporation with hundreds of employees?
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:40.640]  No, they're almost always Sophistic lawyers that come in with no money and leave as $100
[02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:42.640]  million or billionaires.
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:43.640]  They're a bunch of swindlers.
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.640]  Right.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.200]  And they're not there to save money, they're there to spend money, and as a corporate
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:53.480]  operation, as the government should work, it should be looking at how can we maximize
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:54.480]  the effort.
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:55.480]  It's solvency.
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:10:01.120]  I mean, we don't, we need more privatization of, you know, and having more entrepreneurship
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:02.960]  and having more individuals.
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:05.760]  The government shouldn't be controlling so many different things.
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:10.560]  And by the way, where has collectivism worked?
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:16.560]  It's, you know, I can only imagine what would have happened if Hillary would have got into
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:24.080]  office right now and all the things, it's not, it doesn't take, it's just common sense.
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:25.760]  It's a lot of these things are in simplicity.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:26.960]  It's like how to heal the body.
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:32.600]  Well, you can heal the body on just water and clean air and rest most of the time.
[02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:34.800]  But I think that a lot of those things have to be addressed.
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:42.760]  I mean, when you have in the EPA, the people running the EPA are the ex executives at Monsanto
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:48.840]  and Dow Agrisciences and all these corporations, and when you have the government influence
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:55.280]  with the lobbyists for big corporations and, and pushing people out and giving contracts
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.480]  to certain individuals, it's, it's corrupt.
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:00.680]  I mean, we need to get rid of the corruption.
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:05.000]  There's plenty of people out there that are good people that would, that would gladly
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:11.200]  volunteer for government positions without any pay if they had the American people's
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:13.520]  backing to help the, the America.
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:16.800]  I mean, I would, I mean, if there was, look at Trump, look at Trump.
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:17.800]  He's not taking any money.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:18.800]  I know.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:22.240]  I mean, if there was losing money with their attacks on him, not just giving away his salary,
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:23.800]  I know how to fix healthcare.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:25.360]  I've written letters to Melania.
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:27.000]  I've written letters to Tom Price.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.720]  I've written letters to the health and human services.
[02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:31.720]  I've written letters to Donald Trump.
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:33.000]  Have I got any response?
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  No.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.160]  I've got the general letter saying, thanks for sending us a letter, blah, blah, blah.
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:44.960]  There's so much influence by big corporation, by the, by the globalists, that-
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:45.960]  Well, let's explain that.
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:51.040]  They've got genetic engineering, manipulation of the gene code, all the mutations, all the
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:56.920]  horrible toxic garbages going on, and they'll make oil and gas the big enemy or carbon dioxide
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:59.200]  in the atmosphere when it's a red herring.
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:02.560]  That's nothing compared to forced inoculations.
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:06.320]  Nothing compared to how they authorize all these, they say high radiation levels are
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:07.320]  now safe.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:12.360]  And now there's, why are there all these giant radiation blooms in Russia, Europe, the U.S.,
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:15.360]  Canada, Asia, France?
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:17.040]  There's nuclear disasters all the time.
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:18.800]  Suddenly, it's like they're doing it on purpose.
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:22.880]  The levels are rising and rising, and it's not even in the news.
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:26.160]  That's one thing they try to keep out of the news as much as possible because that's a
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:27.720]  silent killer radiation.
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:32.160]  And radiation goes deep, deep, deep with microwave radiation, ionizing radiation.
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:35.320]  I mean, you're talking about the 5G coming out.
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:39.160]  This is a way that people can be easily controlled.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:40.600]  Let's talk about 5G.
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:49.440]  They, the water inside all living things is affected severely by exposure to electromagnetic
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:51.320]  radiation, different types of frequencies.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.320]  Let's be clear.
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.320]  I'm not a scientist.
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:13:00.040]  The 5G, especially, oscillates water, vibrating the DNA chains and breaking them, causing
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:01.840]  mutations which is called cancer.
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:08.000]  Well, how we communicate- They admit, look at that, LA Times, 5G causes cancer and rats.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.160]  This is not our opinion.
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:16.120]  This is, and that's why we're here always saying, this is what you can do to protect
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:17.120]  yourself.
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:22.080]  There's companies, actually right now coming out with clothing, you can get radiation paint
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.760]  for your home now that protects your home from radiation.
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:27.400]  Basically Faraday, K.G. paint on.
[02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:30.080]  It's really sad that we're moving towards that.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.480]  I think the- By the way, they make a joke about it.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:37.960]  I had family at Thanksgiving, you know, nicely, well, it was an after Thanksgiving Christmas
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:38.960]  party.
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:43.400]  Just go, yeah, you know, my brother thinks like you that Alexa is listening to me.
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:47.000]  And I looked at him and I said, the company's patents admit they're listening and put ads
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.240]  on your computer.
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:49.440]  And Google does it too.
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:52.920]  It's like being right and warning someone is like bad.
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:54.920]  And he's telling me, yeah, my brother's like you.
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:56.440]  He thinks, I just laughed at him.
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:57.440]  It's okay.
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:59.960]  But he wanted to, you know, let me know that.
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:02.440]  It's just, it doesn't take a lot of time.
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:04.480]  It's just people don't want to read anymore.
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:06.080]  They don't want to do their own research.
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:09.280]  I shouldn't say that because more and more people are-
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:11.920]  People are either waking up or they're going deeper into it.
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:15.840]  And their friends are starting to tell them and through social media and through your
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:21.000]  show and through all the other real media, not alternative media outlets out there that
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.240]  are actually telling the truth.
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:28.120]  And that's why you're also seeing such a big push to try to shut down into silence, natural
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:29.120]  health care.
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:32.840]  As a matter of fact, the FDA just announced the other day that they're going to be spending
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:36.680]  billions of dollars going after the homeopathic industry now.
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:43.880]  So even, even though the pharmaceutical companies are moving into-
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:44.880]  Moving into.
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:45.880]  They do it.
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:48.920]  They move in to take it over, water it down while they try to block it, then they misrepresent
[02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:49.920]  what it is.
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:52.920]  Just like they're censoring us, blocking us some more and more platforms.
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:55.520]  We just still have to move forward and the listeners keep spreading the info so we're
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:58.600]  going against the curve, going against the wind here, but we're actually having victories
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:00.560]  thanks to prayers and support.
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.680]  But they didn't censor us, shut us down, then attack us everywhere, and then misrepresent
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.680]  what we say.
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:10.200]  So they attack you while they shut you down and don't even let you respond.
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:12.080]  And they're seeing all the advancements too.
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.720]  I mean, just the advancements, a friend of mine owns a stem cell clinic over in Thailand,
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:19.560]  which is Dr. Richard D'Andrea.
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:27.520]  And by the way, now you can get regenerative stem cells for under $50,000, close to $40,000.
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:32.160]  But that's just one advances of many that they're not accepting and letting in because
[02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:33.160]  it's a threat to the-
[02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.920]  To the curve, he said he wants to accelerate the opening up of that.
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:37.920]  He gets it in some areas.
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:42.040]  I mean, while he's eating McDonald's and swimming Diet Coke, we're going to come back, take
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:45.920]  your phone calls on the other side of this break with Dr. Edward Groove.

[02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:59.360]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:03.680]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.440]  Cross of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:12.080]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:16.600]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:17.800]  across America.

[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:25.200]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:26.200]  healthier I feel.
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:28.800]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:34.000]  Maybe over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.480]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.320]  Hello Mr. Anderson, the NSA has noticed how much time you spend on conservative news sites.

[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:35.320]  Too bad hackers never give proper permission to access your cell phone or computer camera.
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:38.320]  Anyone is or could be susceptible to illegal spying.

[02:18:55.320 --> 02:19:01.320]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:07.720]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:14.960]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:20.960]  I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:24.720]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with

[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:42.720]  and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or triple-A2533139 and your purchase of the products stands
[02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:46.280]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:50.520]  satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:58.560]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:22.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:52.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host, Dr. Evergribs Fein.
[02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:55.320]  Our guest writing shotgun as we banter it back and forth here today.
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:02.680]  I'm going to go to your phone calls now and then I'm going to go ahead, I think, and co-host
[02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:07.200]  with Roger Stone in the fourth hour with Dr. Group as well, but I think we'll stick Stone
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:13.400]  over there in that studio, we'll stay in this studio, we'll bifurcate the two between each
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:14.400]  other.
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:20.160]  Also, we don't know if it's going to be another 20, 30 minutes even till the president gives
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:23.760]  his press commerce we're going to cover live, these historic tax cuts.
[02:21:23.760 --> 02:21:27.600]  This is such a big victory, it's such a huge deal.
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:32.640]  Separately, they released some stupid UFO video a week and a half ago and the media
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:36.280]  is asking why we haven't covered it and we're the kings of UFOs.
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:40.480]  We don't cover that stuff, not because there isn't questions out there, I can't get people
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:46.080]  to admit that Aspartame was banned in the 70s because it killed most of the baby monkeys
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:47.080]  that drank it.
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:52.040]  There's studies or how they got it passed, so look, they have me with a UFO electrifying
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:57.320]  me, that's Buzzfeed or Daily Beast, they got two of them out.
[02:21:57.320 --> 02:22:00.880]  Okay, so making me the UFO guy, so let's go ahead and scroll down.
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:02.640]  With your men in black glasses, by the way.
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:07.400]  And it says, info wars the world's foremost for very conspiracy theories, the site has
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:12.400]  not yet mentioned a word about the government program where the government admits UFOs in
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:20.440]  Area 51, because Area 51 is a black site for secret aircraft and a toxic waste dump.
[02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:24.440]  This is all a distraction, they go conspiracy theorists, government released UFO evidence
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:28.920]  to cover up Pizza Gave Las Vegas shooting and I didn't even really say that.
[02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:32.720]  What do you think is going on here, group?
[02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:38.080]  Just another way to divert people's attention away from the truth, I mean, another attack
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:43.600]  on you and just any time they can get any type of evidence or, you know.
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:45.040]  Why do they hate us so much?
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:48.800]  They hate us because we're telling the truth and we're actually helping people, I mean,
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:53.600]  I feel sorry for all those guys whenever they die and they have to go in front of God and
[02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:58.040]  explain how many people that they damaged and hurt and all the different things and
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:00.600]  the karma that they're going to receive.
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:03.640]  It's all about helping people, I mean, that's what we're all about and getting the truth
[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:04.640]  out.
[02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:08.600]  It's perfect, but we're not out to get people, aren't you always shocked by evil people,
[02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:11.120]  how they want to do evil just because that's what they do?
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:14.440]  And they don't even, I mean, I talk to people, I'm like, really, well, did you see that study
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:20.240]  on the fluoride and how it damages the mental ability and how the kids are now coming down
[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:22.760]  with dental fluorosis and spinal fluorosis?
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:26.560]  No, it's just fluoride's good, fluoride's good for you.
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:27.560]  It's like, okay.
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:29.280]  Or they walk over and go, oh, is the fluoride going to get me?
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:33.760]  And I'm like, here's CNN and Harvard admitting it's brain damaging children in utero.
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:38.760]  Before you're born, your brain damage, they just go, F you Russian.
[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:43.560]  Last night, whole family with grandma told me F you, you and Trump are going to jail,
[02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:44.560]  you effing Russians.
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:45.560]  In front of their kids.
[02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:46.560]  I said that.
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:47.560]  Yeah.
[02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:48.560]  I mean,
[02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:49.560]  I have the video.
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:50.560]  I don't know if I should air this.
[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:53.960]  I mean, it's just on a good note though.
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:59.360]  I mean, I think that from what I hear, even the people that are on the far left, some
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:03.320]  of them are actually realizing now because it's just getting so out of hand with CNN
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:08.160]  and all these organizations that are having to retract all their statements now because
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:09.160]  of all the lies.
[02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:13.720]  So, I mean, with Trump, Trump coming out and all the fake news, fake news, fake news
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:18.840]  and people actually looking into it and saying, well, wait a second, that's not really fake
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:20.840]  news.
[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:22.760]  Maybe this is fake news.
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:29.920]  I know I've talked to people that were hardcore CNN watchers, MSNBC, Rachel Maddow, watchers.
[02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:30.920]  They're off of that now.
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:33.960]  They switched over to Fox News and they're watching you now.
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:36.720]  I think that's why the left's really panicking is they're losing their people.
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:37.720]  They're losing them.
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:38.720]  They're losing them.
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:40.120]  Because you're not a right winger and neither am I.
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:41.120]  We're just patriots.
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:43.920]  I'm just a patriot that cares about America, cares about the country.
[02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:46.800]  Remember just even 10 years ago, the good thing about Liberals where they were aware
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:49.680]  of GMO, they were aware of fluoride, they were aware of all this.
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:55.080]  Now, they're pro-radiation, pro-soy, pro-vaccine and it was always the Liberals that were actually
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:56.080]  smart about that.
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:57.080]  No, exactly.
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:58.080]  Where did they all go?
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:24:59.080]  They just don't call themselves Liberals now.
[02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:04.480]  Well, you and I both know that it's dating back to the Illuminati, the Rockefellers,
[02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:06.480]  the Rothschilds, the Bilderberg.
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:11.680]  We know that it doesn't matter if you're Republican or Democrat to a certain degree.
[02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:17.680]  Now you see the biggest split between the Republican versus Democrat, but just because
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:21.080]  of Trump and they admit he's not even a Republican, he's a populist.
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:22.080]  It doesn't matter.
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:26.080]  I mean, look, they're all going to, they're still going to be on the strings and they're
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:30.720]  all puppets in some sense of the word, you know, whenever you look deep and you start
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:34.240]  diving deep into how it all works and how it's all run.
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.280]  Now, what's crazy, we talked about deep state decades ago now, deep states out in the open,
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.800]  world government, CIA, black ops, dumbing kids down by design, it's all coming out because
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:48.120]  people on the inside, the next big shoot-a-drop is top-level FBI have said on air now, we broke
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:50.160]  it weeks ago, they've got bombshell.
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:54.360]  They're about to leak everything on Comey, the Clintons, Mueller, they could have just
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:57.200]  shelled off of the sunset for the better of the country.
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:58.200]  But you know what?
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:25:59.360]  They're going to get locked up now.
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:02.240]  What do you think the Christmas surprise is going to be like?
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:03.240]  What do you see happening?
[02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:08.000]  It's a Kushner, it's a Kushner indictment.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:14.600]  Even with the passing of the tax, I was about to say, they were thinking about it before,
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:18.000]  but now that it all imploded and the witnesses came out and they got caught in the emails
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.560]  colluding and making it up, they were questioning it.
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:25.080]  Now with the tax bill, suddenly I just watched the demeanor during a live presser, not press
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:27.720]  commerce but him in there at the table.
[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:32.600]  Suddenly the arrogance of some of the globalists around him, they're now, you could see it,
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:34.360]  they now know the dam just broke.
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.040]  We just had like battle the bulls level victory.
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:39.440]  This is a huge victory.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:44.480]  This was, they had their big counter offensive, 1944 Hitler and they just got their ass handed
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:45.480]  to him.
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:47.760]  Yeah, we'll see what happens.
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:51.320]  I mean, I think there's going to be a lot of good things that happen as well and going
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:58.120]  into 2018, you know, I just try to tell people not to stress out and keep a good positive
[02:26:58.120 --> 02:26:59.120]  attitude because that's-
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:00.120]  Absolutely.
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:03.160]  People think I'm negative because I sound so angry and I put, I'm very positive exposing
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:07.640]  the negative so folks know what's going on to ex, and I motivate folks to become awake
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:09.040]  but I'm a very positive person.
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:12.360]  Well, just think about 10 years ago when we were talking about New World Order and people
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:14.680]  were looking at us like, new what?
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:16.200]  New world what?
[02:27:16.200 --> 02:27:17.680]  That's just impossible.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:21.120]  Think of how much stuff has actually gotten out.
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:26.080]  You have mainstream media, CNN reporting on fluoride toxicity.
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:28.800]  You have mainstream news, Newsweek, all of these things.
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:31.320]  We've got to do a whole show where we sit down and plan it, where we look at the hundreds
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:35.240]  of things that have been documented that we first broke, just to show people why they're
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:36.240]  so scared.
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:37.240]  We're going to break that promise.
[02:27:37.240 --> 02:27:38.240]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:43.840]  Morgan, Corey, William, Sean, Greg, Melissa, Brad, Aaron, Scott, Kevin, Josh, Carlos, boom,
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:44.840]  boom, boom.
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:47.240]  I'm coming to your right out of this break briefly.
[02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:49.800]  Free shipping is still sort of wide.

[02:27:58.400 --> 02:27:59.400]  out for six months.
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:02.240]  It's so hard to source these ingredients beyond probiotics.
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:06.400]  It's an anti-fungal, anti-yeast, Myco ZX.
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:07.400]  We keep it stock.
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:10.480]  It'd be the best seller we've got sold out for, is it six months or longer?
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:11.480]  Is it six months?
[02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:12.960]  It's been a long time, yes.
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:13.960]  It's been a long time.
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:14.960]  Six months.
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:15.960]  Myco ZX.
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:18.920]  Quite frankly, I told you, I went and tried to make another formula, because I make, and
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:20.400]  then people said, this is a really good formula.
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:23.880]  This stuff's hard to get, spent, and so, you know, we're still going to sell this regardless,
[02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:25.280]  but it's so hard to get it sourced.

[02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:05.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:21.800]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does
[02:33:21.800 --> 02:33:29.280]  happen.
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:35.840]  From the front lines of the Information War is Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:41.360]  Well, Trump and the American people take an action delivered again on the biggest tax
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:48.040]  cuts in history, the biggest tax cuts in modern history.
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:49.480]  It's all happening right now.
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:59.760]  All of it, and Rosie O'Donnell, to give an example, is such a delusional individual that
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:04.480]  she said, well, please don't kill people, so because she's the saint saying don't kill
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:10.440]  people, which is a total lie, about killing people, I'll give $2 million to each of the
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:12.680]  two senators to kill this bill.
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:15.440]  She said, I'm not kidding, private message me on Twitter.
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:17.560]  See, the Democrats think they can just commit crimes.
[02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:24.120]  If the next, if Susan gets five of his friends to give money to a Senate candidate, well then
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:25.120]  he goes to prison.
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:30.360]  But if Rosie O'Donnell says, so how about this, I promise to give $2 million to a Senator
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:35.080]  Susan Collins and $2 million to Senator Jeff Flake, if they vote no, no, I will not kill
[02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:38.080]  Americans for the super rich.
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:41.400]  It's almost like they don't want to see America succeed.
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:44.640]  She says, DM me, DM me, Jeff, and it goes on.
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:46.680]  She says, I'm really ready to pay you off.
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:48.720]  Watch, I bet she doesn't get in trouble.
[02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:53.720]  These people are ruthless, they're crazy, and exactly, they want the foot on America's
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:54.720]  neck.
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:34:55.720]  They know about the scam.
[02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:57.520]  They want a piss on flyover country.
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:00.240]  It just amazes me.
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:02.240]  You've heard the recordings.
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:07.000]  And I almost think that they're just shaking in fear right now because of all the stuff
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:10.760]  that's coming out and everything they're trying to do is backfiring in their face.
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:16.440]  I mean, from the Russian investigation to this, to that, to tax, to, you know, think
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:18.080]  about when Obamacare came out.
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:20.320]  It was supposed to save us all money.
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:22.520]  Everybody was supposed to get healthcare.
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:25.360]  Everybody was going to be taken care of.
[02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:31.160]  You could keep your own doctor, all this stuff that they came out with.
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:37.520]  And now, you know, just like they're attacking the tax care plan, I mean, the tax bill, this
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:38.800]  is actually going to do good.
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:41.040]  I mean, you know, obviously, I don't know.
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:44.560]  Somebody told me that it was like six or seven inches thick and that the lobbying groups
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:45.560]  have started.
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:48.960]  It's not going to be perfect, but the globalists, the globalists try to stop it.
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.680]  But I mean, the main thing is in order to bring back jobs to Americans and to give us
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:58.480]  some, you know, our companies that are founded by American citizens.
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:02.160]  Well, the globalists had already written it with the big Fortune 100 for tax exempt.
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:06.800]  This is going to let the smaller companies, the $200 million, the $50 million, the billion
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:10.400]  dollar that aren't in the club, bring stuff back here and give them an incentive because
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:14.680]  they, they kept saying for decades, like Trump said, I can't make my ties in America.
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:15.680]  There'll be $100.
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:19.000]  I'm making a Mexico, they're 20 and you, you can't wait.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  This is a screw job.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:21.000]  He was honest in the debates.
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  It's a course.
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:23.500]  I make it in China.
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:24.500]  You can't make it here.
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:27.280]  Well, because who can afford to do that?
[02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:29.080]  I mean, because you have to pay so much.
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:30.080]  Exactly.
[02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:31.080]  It's all a rig deal.
[02:36:31.080 --> 02:36:32.080]  Okay.
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:33.080]  I promise go to your calls at the grips here.
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:35.400]  Morgan and Washington, we're going to write to you first.
[02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:36.920]  Morgan, you're on the year with Dr. Griff.
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:37.920]  Go ahead.
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:42.360]  Welcome from our greetings, I should say, from FEMA region 10.
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:49.960]  I just wanted to first off give hats off to both Dr. Group and you, Alex, for the incredible
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:56.080]  supplements and nutraceuticals because so far I've got liver, cleanse, eggs to alpha
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:03.000]  power, red pill, anthroplex and brain force and oxy powder.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:08.160]  And I can tell everybody that they do precisely what you say that they do.
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:15.840]  Now my question is this, apparently, according to my dermatologist, the American public,
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:24.440]  about one in four, maybe two and five people nowadays have psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:30.320]  With something that's so prevalent, I'm wondering if you know what in the world causes this
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:33.280]  and what can you do to get rid of it?
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:37.360]  But it acts more like a fungus than it does anything else.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:40.960]  So I'm baffled and the dermatologist won't tell me a thing.
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:45.200]  Yeah, that's a situation that we deal with fairly often.
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:46.440]  How much is psoriasis up?
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:47.440]  It's way up, right?
[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:56.040]  Well, not only psoriasis, all skin issues, skin rash, contact dermatitis, funguses in
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:57.040]  skin.
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:37:58.040]  I mean, you're looking at skin.
[02:37:58.040 --> 02:37:59.880]  Back to this fungus explosion.
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:02.600]  What's driving the fungus explosion?
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:05.040]  What's driving the fungus explosion?
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:06.920]  A lot of it has to do with the environment.
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:08.640]  A lot of it has to do with our food.
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:10.640]  A lot of it has to do with the exposure.
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:16.640]  We're getting all different types of new funguses that we're finding.
[02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:22.840]  There was a report that I brought with me on a zombie fungus now that's literally controlling
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:26.640]  and turning fruit flies into slaves.
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:28.160]  Oh, well, you can't make this up.
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:29.160]  In fact, you can't.
[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:31.160]  I mean, that's what you were saying last time you were here.
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:35.640]  They're thinking now, some funguses are a colony group, but it's communicating as a
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:39.240]  group brain because how else could it take over a bug?
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:44.240]  Well, that's what the microscopic thing you said, you said they're actually in your gut
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:47.080]  attaching themselves to the nerve gangly.
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:48.840]  And that's why they didn't tell you the food they want.
[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:49.840]  Here it is.
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:50.840]  Zombie fungus.
[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:51.840]  This is new scientists.
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:54.400]  This is not a, the media is going to say we made this up.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:57.880]  Zombie fungus infects fruit flies and turns them into slaves.
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:38:58.880]  Tell folks about this.
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:38:59.880]  No.
[02:38:59.880 --> 02:39:02.080]  So what it's doing is it's getting into animals.
[02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:03.320]  It's not only fruit flies.
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:08.320]  It's actually happening with other insects as well, and it makes the insects climb to
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:16.280]  the top of the plant and, and attach themselves and chew with their teeth into the plant,
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:19.240]  into the stalk or something and sit there until it dies.
[02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:20.720]  It like freezes them.
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:26.000]  And then all of these, these fungal organisms start growing out of their heads and, and
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.760]  start replicating and, and things like that.
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:29.760]  Now, why?
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:34.600]  There's a worm that also gets into, to, to caterpillars and, and then they go up the
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:36.920]  top of the tree and get eaten by birds.
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:42.560]  The birds crap it out again and, and the, the organism actually goes into the brain
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:43.560]  and controls it.
[02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:44.560]  Not.
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:48.760]  So, so what I'm saying is just be aware and always keep your body clean.
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:53.640]  And I tell you, like your question for the skin disorders, we are actually seeing the
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:57.840]  chemicals that are being used to wash clothes.
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:39:58.840]  Okay.
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:00.240]  And there's even fungus.
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:04.520]  You could look at washing machines now and, and why are washing, my washing machine suddenly
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:09.480]  just stink at the clean amount with the, with the white vinegar and do all those processes.
[02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:10.480]  What is going on?
[02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:11.480]  Right.
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:15.080]  Because we sweat and we're getting stuff from the air and then we're putting toxic chemicals
[02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:19.440]  in our, in our laundry detergent or we're sent or our clothes are picking up bacteria
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:20.760]  and fungus from the air.
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:24.560]  I know he should probably with bleach and everything, we'll wash all the clothes on
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:30.280]  hot, hot, when it's sunny, like old fashioned hangout, the linens, the sunlight kills it.
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:33.000]  If you have to throw away all the linens, get new ones.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.040]  So with, with any skin condition, a lot of times it's associated with the gut, okay?
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:39.200]  Because it's the same tissue.
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:42.720]  So I would definitely recommend you're on the right track, you know, with the oxy powder
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:46.680]  and with the biome defense 50 or the good probiotic, the 50 million probiotic from Info
[02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:51.400]  Wars, you know, healing the gut does tremendous things for the skin, but also some of the
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:57.800]  things that have worked for me for skin conditions is ozonated olive oil, the iodine, believe
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:02.840]  it or not, the X2 is incredible, just vegetable glycerin alone.
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:06.520]  That can be rubbed on it, but really trying to find and addressing the root causes of
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:08.240]  the situation.
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:12.120]  And because of all the fire retardants, because of the endocrine disrupting chemicals in
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:15.120]  homes, people are sleeping on memory foam mattresses.
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:19.280]  That's even been linked to sleep as well as skin conditions.
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:22.960]  So that's one caller of like 20 and it was a great question.
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:28.560]  We got, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's cram in Corey in Oregon real fast about holographic
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:29.560]  devices.
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:30.560]  Go ahead.
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:31.560]  Hey, Corey.
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:40.320]  I called about a year ago and I was a veteran that had some pretty bad PTSD and I called
[02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:41.320]  up and said, hello.
[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:42.320]  And you're like, Hey, yeah.
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:45.680]  And we talked for a little bit, but not too much.
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:54.000]  What I wanted to ask Dr. Group was if he had ever worked with people as far as the PTSD
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:00.360]  therapy involving holographic type therapy, it's called holographic epistemology.
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:05.920]  It was written by a doctor down in New Zealand, Dr. Manilati Meyer.
[02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:06.920]  And it's pretty new.
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:08.600]  It's only been out for a few years.
[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:14.920]  It's based upon basically logos, the logos, the word of God, Jesus Christ being made
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:18.520]  manifest through the mind, body and spirit of human being.
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:22.520]  Well, they found true spiritual conversions are more powerful than anything, even chemically
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:23.520]  in the brain.
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:24.520]  You want to comment on that?
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:31.200]  As far as PTSD, I do do a lot of work with military and other people that just have PTSD.
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:37.120]  I have not been directly involved in holographic, that holographic treatment, but have looked
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:43.880]  at some of the new advances in holographic medicinal techniques as far as limb regeneration
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:47.800]  as well as teaching and some of the benefits that we might be looking at.
[02:42:47.800 --> 02:42:48.800]  All right, Corey.
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:49.800]  Boom.

[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:39.840]  By the way, in a totally classic example of tomorrow's news today, Joe Scalzen, who obviously is heavily connected to the Bundys and others because he's a Latter-day Saint Mormon and a leader in that movement,
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:43.840]  he told us there was going to be a mistrial announced tomorrow.
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:49.840]  And I'm like, OK, Joe Scalzen didn't tell you something unless it's true.
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:50.840]  Very accurate fellow.
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:57.840]  Fox News, case against Clavin Bundy, Nevada Rancher involved in 2015, armed standoff, declared a mistrial.
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:01.840]  Fox News, literally tomorrow's news today.
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:02.840]  That's why they hate us.
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:03.840]  I love that, yeah.
[02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:04.840]  That's why they hate us.
[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:06.840]  And that is just- and you were telling me-
[02:48:06.840 --> 02:48:08.840]  Tomorrow's health today, too.
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:09.840]  Exactly.
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  I was saying, it's so sad about how they've taken the NFL as a political weapon and how its ratings are down 30, 40 percent.
[02:48:16.840 --> 02:48:20.840]  This America thing is like falling apart. You said, have you heard? I said, no, you gave me the article.
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:23.840]  Panther sales sparks buzz the political business circles.
[02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:28.840]  Pete Itty, Kaepernick, all of them, to buy it and make it like the Black Panthers, I guess.
[02:48:28.840 --> 02:48:30.840]  The America hate team.
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:35.840]  Just a new level of just BS.
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:37.840]  I mean, it really is crazy.
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:38.840]  You guys are filthy rich.
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:40.840]  America's totally embraced you.
[02:48:40.840 --> 02:48:42.840]  All these white fans go out, but you're a globalist.
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:44.840]  You've got these chips on your shoulder.
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:45.840]  I hope you buy the team.
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:47.840]  There'll be so much in fighting, it'll be bankrupt in a year.
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:49.840]  What do you say?
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:51.840]  We'll see what happens with that.
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:57.840]  I mean, they're just trying to do anything they can to reach the public and to try to get a message out.
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:48:59.840]  Every day is a new day.
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:05.840]  And as we're helping people and more and more people are becoming educated, it's actually a good thing.
[02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:09.840]  I mean, I'm happy moving forward in a positive direction.
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:11.840]  I think that good things are on the horizon.
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:21.840]  I know that we have a lot of evidence that still hasn't even come out yet regarding a lot of these scenarios that are currently going on in the government.
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:26.840]  So there's a lot of, as time goes on, as Trump stays in office, as new people come in.
[02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:27.840]  It's happening.
[02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:28.840]  It's the impulse pouring out.
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:29.840]  Getting drained.
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:31.840]  I mean, look at all of the info.
[02:49:31.840 --> 02:49:37.840]  I mean, we've known that there's been a lot of forces deployed to clean up this pedophile ring all over the world.
[02:49:37.840 --> 02:49:46.840]  And we're seeing, you know, a lot of the things that are being cleaned up are not in mainstream, in the mainstream news.
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:48.840]  I mean, so we're seeing a lot of progress being made.
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:51.840]  I mean, I talked to military people that are involved.
[02:49:51.840 --> 02:49:52.840]  You talked to people.
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:50:06.840]  I have state senators and politicians calling my office right now asking me what we what what we can do that listen to you that know what's currently going on that are saying, hey, we're seeing the shift.
[02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:07.840]  No, this is real.
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:08.840]  That's why they're freaking out.
[02:50:08.840 --> 02:50:12.840]  And, you know, I'm not for just killing people outright.
[02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:19.840]  But, you know, part of that is some of the people that are trafficking these kids, they're not getting arrested, especially when they're snuff filming and stuff.
[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:21.840]  They're just getting their heads blown off.
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:23.840]  They're getting an acid bath.
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:25.840]  So that's what's that's why they're freaking out.
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:29.840]  And you can see their minions are panicking because they're trying to leave the U.S.
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:31.840]  They're trying to get out because they are scared right now.
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:43.840]  Yeah, I mean, it just confirms more and more what we've been saying for years and years and years and years about all these different things that people call those idiots and quacks and you know what you're talking about.
[02:50:43.840 --> 02:50:45.840]  And there's no possible way that could be happening.
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:47.840]  It is insane to be vindicated like this.
[02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:48.840]  It's crazy.
[02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:49.840]  We're just going off the global standup rate.
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:51.840]  Oh, wait, we're doing the whole next hour of Roger Stone.
[02:50:51.840 --> 02:50:53.840]  So all you that are on hold, you're all getting on air.
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:56.840]  We're getting all the let's go to who was up next.
[02:50:56.840 --> 02:50:58.840]  Oh, so many callers.
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:05.840]  Do you guys pick them during the break and then I want to make them like a purple mark so I can tell them I go to Sean in Texas.
[02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:06.840]  There's so many callers there.
[02:51:06.840 --> 02:51:07.840]  Sean in Texas.
[02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:08.840]  You're on the air right now.
[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:09.840]  Dr. group.
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:10.840]  Go ahead.
[02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:11.840]  How you guys doing?
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:12.840]  Good brother.
[02:51:12.840 --> 02:51:14.840]  Thanks for calling and holding a no problem.
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:16.840]  It's a wonderful talk you guys.
[02:51:16.840 --> 02:51:17.840]  Dr. group.
[02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:18.840]  Thank you for your service.
[02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:22.840]  I'm actually I'm headed to an accountability formation here in just a minute.
[02:51:22.840 --> 02:51:23.840]  So I got to be quick.
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:26.840]  I just I mean, I'm going to skip all day.
[02:51:26.840 --> 02:51:27.840]  No windows.
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:34.840]  I mean, this building 50 years old HVAC system and I'm dealing with, I mean, heavy, heavy fatigue during the day.
[02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:36.840]  I'm drinking one or two monsters a day.
[02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:37.840]  At least once you die.
[02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:40.840]  Coke's a day in my head is bobbing all class.
[02:51:40.840 --> 02:51:48.840]  I mean, in there eight to 10 hours a day trying to get this this training done to get into the real army with say so.
[02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:51.840]  Well, let me let me if you're doing that.
[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:56.840]  The first thing you need to do if you have low energy levels is look at what you're putting in your mouth and what you're drinking.
[02:51:56.840 --> 02:52:04.840]  Because if you're on if you're on diet drinks, number one, that's going to be causing a lot of problems in your system.
[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:06.840]  It's going to be congesting the liver.
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:12.840]  People that have you need to take clean stimulants if you are like brain force or like 12.
[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:15.840]  I mean, if you want a boost of energy, absolutely 12.
[02:52:15.840 --> 02:52:17.840]  There's nothing faster than that.
[02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:23.840]  I mean, DNA forces is amazing to so many reviews on how DNA force has increased.
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:27.840]  But I feel like this guy I lifted weights, I ran, but I was living unhealthy.
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:29.840]  And then as I slowed down, I fell apart quickly.
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:33.840]  Then as I did the good stuff, I dug at least 70 something pounds.
[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:36.840]  I was almost 300 pounds out of the hole partially.
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:45.840]  But but absolutely, Sean, I mean, energy get before before exercise, Sean energy drinks are extremely toxic to your body.
[02:52:45.840 --> 02:52:48.840]  You're clogging up your energy levels in your body.
[02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:49.840]  They shoot your adrenals.
[02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:51.840]  They burn your adrenal glands out.
[02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:56.840]  And usually the reason why people don't have enough energy, the number one reason,
[02:52:56.840 --> 02:53:01.840]  and they start being fatigued in the afternoon is because of their diet and what they're putting in their system.
[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:02.840]  So I would look at that first.
[02:53:02.840 --> 02:53:04.840]  I mean, yeah, you can take brain force.
[02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:05.840]  You can take a DNA force.
[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:06.840]  We got to jump.
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:07.840]  Sean, God bless you.
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:08.840]  We got to jump.
[02:53:08.840 --> 02:53:09.840]  We got to jump here as well.
[02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:10.840]  This is a big one.
[02:53:10.840 --> 02:53:16.840]  Melissa in Nevada questions for Dr. for us both on the flu vaccine.
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:17.840]  Go ahead.
[02:53:17.840 --> 02:53:19.840]  Go ahead, Melissa.
[02:53:19.840 --> 02:53:21.840]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:22.840]  Hi.
[02:53:22.840 --> 02:53:23.840]  Okay.
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:25.840]  So I've been trying to call on this forever.
[02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:27.840]  We've never taken the flu shot.
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:32.840]  Well, this year, besides the school making the meningitis shot mandatory.
[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:35.840]  There is no state where shots are mandatory.
[02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:38.840]  They lie to you in a hoax and tell you it's mandatory.
[02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:39.840]  There is a waiver form.
[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:40.840]  There is no law.
[02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:41.840]  It's a fraud.
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:42.840]  Yeah.
[02:53:42.840 --> 02:53:45.840]  So we had to get a religious exemption in order for her not to get it.
[02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:54.840]  So now they were bribing the children at this middle school to get the flu shot with movie tickets and hydroflask water bottles.
[02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:55.840]  Oh, oh, so you're making me mad.
[02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:56.840]  Absolutely.
[02:53:56.840 --> 02:53:59.840]  California passed the law that 12 year olds could take it if they won.
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:01.840]  Getting rid of parental consent.
[02:54:01.840 --> 02:54:02.840]  This is incredible.
[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:03.840]  You're absolutely right.
[02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:06.840]  So now they're bribing kids to take it and not tell the parents.
[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:07.840]  Tell us about that.
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:08.840]  Okay.
[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:14.840]  So they were offering and they sent out an email to the parents like, hey, convince your kids to take it and this is what they can win.
[02:54:14.840 --> 02:54:15.840]  Oh my God.
[02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:17.840]  But she still never got it.
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:25.840]  So now they are going into her classrooms and singling her out, telling her that she has to get this done.
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:32.840]  They even have a cop show up at the school bus to intimidate the parents like you did something wrong.
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:34.840]  Yes, they're going to total intimidation level.
[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:35.840]  Yeah.
[02:54:35.840 --> 02:54:37.840]  And so we never, we still haven't done it.
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:43.840]  And they finally stopped badgering her about it because I called the school nurse and totally flipped out on her.
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:46.840]  But I do have a question for you.
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:51.840]  Is there an age limit to some of these products that you guys offer?
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:56.840]  We've been giving our children their 12 and 14, the X2.
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:00.840]  And her grades have gone up so good.
[02:55:00.840 --> 02:55:02.840]  Like it's totally helped her.
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:11.840]  Well, ma'am, let me tell you, if you Google, if you search engine, iodine deficiency, IQ reduction, electrochemical reduction, it's absolutely a fact.
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:13.840]  You die without it.
[02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:15.840]  It's why they've reduced it and all the food down to nothing.
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:18.840]  It is the key to electrochemical activity, but everything else out there isn't real iodine.
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:19.840]  It's bound.
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:20.840]  It's not absorbed.
[02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:21.840]  This is a key call.
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:22.840]  Hold on.
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:24.840]  I don't mean to interrupt that because I'm still out of control here.
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:27.840]  Because I'm here, you have to say group and we're going to do five minutes with her.
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:28.840]  This is so important.
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:31.840]  Tell us what happened with your daughter when she took the X2.
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:36.840]  Oh, so she's really, math is not her strong suit at all.
[02:55:36.840 --> 02:55:40.840]  So we have, for a few months, she's been taking the X2.
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:44.840]  And she now has a B in math, which she's never had.
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:51.840]  So she's like a CD kind of kid when it came to math, but she's starting to understand it better.
[02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:55.840]  So now she has a B in it, which is amazing for us.
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:57.840]  And even our son takes it.
[02:55:57.840 --> 02:55:59.840]  He's not a huge fan, but we make him.
[02:55:59.840 --> 02:56:04.840]  He's super hyperactive and super, super smart.
[02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:06.840]  So he's too smart for his own good.
[02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:11.840]  So it kind of helps calm them down and make them think a little bit, but we all take it as a family.
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:12.840]  And it's been great.
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:15.840]  Like I feel calmer and I sleep better.
[02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:17.840]  And so the X2 is amazing.
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:25.840]  But we just wanted to know if there was age limits on the rest of this stuff, like the knockout or like that.
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:27.840]  I take the selenium.
[02:56:27.840 --> 02:56:30.840]  They try to put me on a thyroid medication and I refuse to.
[02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:35.840]  And it helps kind of regulate that hormone for me.
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:37.840]  It takes a while to regulate that.
[02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:38.840]  That's a great question.
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:41.840]  You know, I personally, it's a strong dose on the bottle.
[02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:42.840]  Some people need to go a lot less.
[02:56:42.840 --> 02:56:45.840]  Obviously for children, consult your health care provider or physician.
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:48.840]  I mean, I mean, Dr. Group, without iodine, children die without it.
[02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:50.840]  They have lower IQs if it's a deficiency.
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:51.840]  That's a fact.
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:52.840]  We can say that.
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:53.840]  So, so.
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:57:02.840]  Well, the answer to that question is most anything that's natural and raw is is going to be fairly safe for children.
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:12.840]  And but the reason why that supplement companies put do not take under 12 is because it's a liability number one for the company.
[02:57:12.840 --> 02:57:19.840]  And number two, you know, parents, there's not a lot of studies that have been done on children.
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:27.840]  So it's more of a safety issue with liability with something's going to actually happen.
[02:57:27.840 --> 02:57:28.840]  Exactly.
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:29.840]  So it's up to you.
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:31.840]  We're saying under 12 don't take it.
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:32.840]  It's up to you.
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:38.840]  I personally, everything in knockout, you know, my children, if they're high for whatever, they love it.
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:39.840]  Stay there.
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:42.840]  We had a five year old drink a whole bottle of X2 and was, you know.
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:43.840]  Stay there Melissa.

[02:59:53.840 --> 03:00:11.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:27.840]  Melissa in Nevada, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:00:27.840 --> 03:00:31.840]  You were breaking down your daughter taking X2.
[03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:34.840]  I remember five years ago when Group was developing it,
[03:00:34.840 --> 03:00:37.840]  and he hadn't even gotten the True Deep Earth Crystal source yet,
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:41.840]  and it was a clean seaweed-based system that wasn't as strong.
[03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:43.840]  Some say, well, this is really strong on the bottle.
[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:45.840]  Well, maybe you take a third of it or whatever.
[03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:47.840]  This is serious stuff, folks.
[03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:49.840]  The point is, without it, you die.
[03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:52.840]  But if your body doesn't have it, it'll use bad halogens, chlorine, fluoride, you name it.
[03:00:52.840 --> 03:00:55.840]  The globalist bombard us with fluoride, knowing it lowers IQ.
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:00:57.840]  These are mainline studies.
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:00:59.840]  What is true iodine do?
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:02.840]  It raises IQ because you have to have it.
[03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:05.840]  So I began taking it, and Group said, watch out in about three weeks,
[03:01:05.840 --> 03:01:07.840]  because it first had a lot of energy.
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:09.840]  It felt really weird.
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:11.840]  Three weeks didn't kind of get toxic.
[03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:13.840]  I felt like I was coming over for three days,
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:15.840]  and then all of a sudden, it's like when you're carrying your kid up long steps,
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:17.840]  you take them off your shoulders.
[03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:19.840]  You feel like you're flying.
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:21.840]  It was like, I woke up one morning, and I felt like,
[03:01:21.840 --> 03:01:23.840]  I'm not really taking drugs, but I guess what drugs feel like,
[03:01:23.840 --> 03:01:25.840]  I felt like I was floating.
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:27.840]  It was like, whoa, I got so much energy,
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:29.840]  and then when I forget to take it,
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:31.840]  because I've never been a supplement guy with all these supplements.
[03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:33.840]  I'm kind of, whoa, and then I remember to take my X2,
[03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:35.840]  and then a week, it's back.
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:37.840]  It's just simply amazing.
[03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:39.840]  Keep going, we'll go back to her.
[03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:41.840]  When we started looking at deficiencies,
[03:01:41.840 --> 03:01:43.840]  and especially with Blalock,
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:45.840]  you start seeing that
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:47.840]  massive amounts of iodine deficiency
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:49.840]  all over the world,
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:51.840]  and when you look at the problems that we're having...
[03:01:51.840 --> 03:01:53.840]  Some villages in China, like a third of the kids are retarded.
[03:01:53.840 --> 03:01:55.840]  Yes.
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:57.840]  But then you even look further
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:01:59.840]  and say, why is that?
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:01.840]  Why do we have an iodine deficiency?
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:03.840]  It leads you down that rabbit hole
[03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:05.840]  of when fluoride was introduced
[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:07.840]  and why it was introduced into the water.
[03:02:07.840 --> 03:02:09.840]  And then all the other ones are sodium,
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:11.840]  or they're not good, or they're bound,
[03:02:11.840 --> 03:02:13.840]  and they don't absorb it, they make you sick.
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:15.840]  So why don't we have a clean one?
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:17.840]  So iodine is used for every single cell.
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:19.840]  There's a receptor in the body.
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:21.840]  People think it's just for the thyroid and all that,
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:23.840]  but iodine...
[03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:25.840]  It's estimated that up to 2 billion people
[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:27.840]  have iodine deficiency.
[03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:29.840]  It's way more than that,
[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:31.840]  probably the World Health Organization
[03:02:31.840 --> 03:02:33.840]  or something like that,
[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:35.840]  and all those numbers released by the CDC
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:37.840]  are all...
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:39.840]  And they keep lowering the recommended daily allowance.
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:41.840]  Well, you have a massive amount
[03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:43.840]  of endocrine-disrupting chemicals,
[03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:45.840]  which, by the way, estrogen-disrupting chemicals
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:47.840]  also block iodine absorption.
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:49.840]  Most people don't even know that,
[03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:51.840]  but then you have bromine, fluoride, and chlorine.
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:53.840]  Well, that's it.
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:55.840]  I mean, let me just say what happens.
[03:02:55.840 --> 03:02:57.840]  Stamina, libido, energy, aggression,
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:02:59.840]  and then I take the iodine,
[03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:01.840]  and then I feel so good, I feel great quitaing,
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:03.840]  and then I kind of go back down.
[03:03:03.840 --> 03:03:05.840]  I mean, it's so incredible.
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:07.840]  It's like a precursor to everything.
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:09.840]  It is, and all of these things
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:11.840]  calcify the pineal gland,
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:13.840]  and how are you going to get these toxic chemicals out?
[03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:15.840]  There's not a magic pill you can take
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:17.840]  that gets rid of all the fluoride.
[03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:19.840]  Iodine will push those compounds out,
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:21.840]  and...
[03:03:21.840 --> 03:03:23.840]  Why do you have the effect
[03:03:23.840 --> 03:03:25.840]  where you feel bad two, three weeks in?
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:27.840]  Because you're going to start detoxifying
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:29.840]  your body of the toxic chemicals,
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:31.840]  fluoride, bromine, and chlorine,
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:33.840]  which are damaging
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:35.840]  and being stored in your cells
[03:03:35.840 --> 03:03:37.840]  and being stored in your thyroid gland.
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:39.840]  So when your body starts to detoxify
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:41.840]  and those iodine starts coming back
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:43.840]  into those glandular organs...
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:45.840]  Hold on. The president's about to speak.
[03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:47.840]  You may go through some detoxification symptoms.
[03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:49.840]  We've got to go to break.
[03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:51.840]  These are network breaks,
[03:03:51.840 --> 03:03:53.840]  but I feel like I should skip this one,
[03:03:53.840 --> 03:03:55.840]  but I mean, Trump is about to speak
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:57.840]  here at
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:03:59.840]  yhouse.gov. This is on infowars.com.
[03:03:59.840 --> 03:04:01.840]  Let's just go to him as we go to break,
[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:03.840]  and we'll back it back up. Here we go.
[03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:05.840]  Right behind me.
[03:04:05.840 --> 03:04:07.840]  They've worked so long, so hard.
[03:04:07.840 --> 03:04:09.840]  It's been
[03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:11.840]  an amazing experience,
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:13.840]  I have to tell you.
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:15.840]  Hasn't been done in 34 years,
[03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:17.840]  but actually really hasn't been done
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:19.840]  because we broke every record.
[03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:21.840]  It's the largest,
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:23.840]  I always say the most massive,
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:25.840]  but it's the largest tax cut
[03:04:25.840 --> 03:04:27.840]  in the history of our country
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:29.840]  and reform, but tax cut.
[03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:31.840]  Wow.
[03:04:31.840 --> 03:04:33.840]  This is live, but now it won't be when we come back.
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:35.840]  And I noticed this just came out.
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:37.840]  One minute break. Just back it up.
[03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:39.840]  This is a day long remember.
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:41.840]  The globalists are pulling
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:43.840]  their hair out right now. You're actually going to get
[03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:45.840]  money as a general public and jobs.
[03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:47.840]  I have a globalist system where it's all off-shored,
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:49.840]  where we have the high taxes, they have the low taxes.
[03:04:49.840 --> 03:04:51.840]  This is big.
[03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:21.840]  This essential mineral is necessary
[03:05:21.840 --> 03:05:23.840]  in order to produce thyroid hormones
[03:05:23.840 --> 03:05:25.840]  which influence every cell,
[03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:27.840]  tissue and organ in the body.
[03:05:27.840 --> 03:05:29.840]  With inadequate thyroid hormones,
[03:05:29.840 --> 03:05:31.840]  you may experience slow metabolism,
[03:05:31.840 --> 03:05:34.840]  lethargy, weight gain, and overall brain fog.
[03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:36.840]  Survival Shield X2
[03:05:36.840 --> 03:05:38.840]  and BioTrue Selenium work together
[03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:40.840]  to support the systems in your body.

[03:05:42.840 --> 03:05:44.840]  with this super combo.

[03:06:19.840 --> 03:06:21.840]  We're back live.
[03:06:21.840 --> 03:06:23.840]  The president is speaking right now.
[03:06:23.840 --> 03:06:25.840]  Right now.
[03:06:25.840 --> 03:06:27.840]  Let's go ahead and go to that live feed
[03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:29.840]  of him talking about the historic tax cuts
[03:06:29.840 --> 03:06:31.840]  that he just signed.
[03:06:31.840 --> 03:06:33.840]  Here we go.
[03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:35.840]  $1,000 special bonus to more than
[03:06:35.840 --> 03:06:37.840]  200,000 U.S.
[03:06:37.840 --> 03:06:39.840]  employees and that's because of what we did.
[03:06:39.840 --> 03:06:41.840]  That's pretty good.
[03:06:41.840 --> 03:06:43.840]  That's pretty good.
[03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:45.840]  And
[03:06:45.840 --> 03:06:47.840]  I have a whole list of
[03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:49.840]  accomplishments that the group behind
[03:06:49.840 --> 03:06:51.840]  me have done in terms of
[03:06:51.840 --> 03:06:53.840]  this administration and this
[03:06:53.840 --> 03:06:55.840]  Congress, but
[03:06:55.840 --> 03:06:57.840]  you've heard it before.
[03:06:57.840 --> 03:06:59.840]  Records all over the place
[03:06:59.840 --> 03:07:01.840]  and that will continue
[03:07:01.840 --> 03:07:03.840]  and then some because of what we did.
[03:07:03.840 --> 03:07:05.840]  But
[03:07:05.840 --> 03:07:07.840]  $3.2 trillion, just think of it,
[03:07:07.840 --> 03:07:09.840]  in tax cuts for American families,
[03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:11.840]  including doubling the standard deduction
[03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:13.840]  and doubling the child
[03:07:13.840 --> 03:07:15.840]  tax credit.
[03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:17.840]  The typical family
[03:07:17.840 --> 03:07:19.840]  of four earning $75,000
[03:07:19.840 --> 03:07:21.840]  will see an income tax
[03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:23.840]  cut of more than $2,000.
[03:07:23.840 --> 03:07:25.840]  They're going to have $2,000 and that's
[03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:27.840]  in my opinion going to be
[03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:29.840]  less than the average. You're going to have a lot more than
[03:07:29.840 --> 03:07:31.840]  that.
[03:07:31.840 --> 03:07:33.840]  One thing very important for the farmers,
[03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:35.840]  the great farmers and the great
[03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:37.840]  small business owners that were
[03:07:37.840 --> 03:07:39.840]  forced to sell their businesses
[03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:41.840]  at bargain basement numbers.
[03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:43.840]  We have provided for
[03:07:43.840 --> 03:07:45.840]  the most part
[03:07:45.840 --> 03:07:47.840]  estate taxes wiped out so they can
[03:07:47.840 --> 03:07:49.840]  keep their farms in the family and that to me
[03:07:49.840 --> 03:07:51.840]  is a very big factor.
[03:07:51.840 --> 03:07:53.840]  That is so huge. The estate tax for the farmers
[03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:55.840]  gone baby. We need to keep the farm.
[03:07:55.840 --> 03:07:57.840]  This is going to mean companies are going
[03:07:57.840 --> 03:07:59.840]  to be coming back and I campaigned on
[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:01.840]  the fact that we're not going to lose our
[03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:03.840]  companies anymore. They're going to stay
[03:08:03.840 --> 03:08:05.840]  in our country and they're going to stay
[03:08:05.840 --> 03:08:07.840]  in our country and you've been seeing what's
[03:08:07.840 --> 03:08:09.840]  been happening even at this prospect.
[03:08:09.840 --> 03:08:11.840]  But they have tremendous enthusiasm right
[03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:13.840]  now in this country and we have companies
[03:08:13.840 --> 03:08:15.840]  pouring back into our country
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:17.840]  and that means jobs and it means really
[03:08:17.840 --> 03:08:19.840]  the formation of new
[03:08:19.840 --> 03:08:21.840]  young beautiful strong companies so
[03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:23.840]  that's going to be very very important.
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:25.840]  The pass-throughs you know all about
[03:08:25.840 --> 03:08:27.840]  and the small businesses are going to be
[03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:29.840]  big beneficiaries. We are going
[03:08:29.840 --> 03:08:31.840]  to bring at least four trillion dollars
[03:08:31.840 --> 03:08:33.840]  back into this country. The money that
[03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:35.840]  was frozen overseas and
[03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:37.840]  in parts and worlds and
[03:08:37.840 --> 03:08:39.840]  some of them don't even like us and they had
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:41.840]  the money. Well they're not going to have the money
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:43.840]  long.
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:45.840]  So it's really
[03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:47.840]  I guess it's very simple
[03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:49.840]  when you think you haven't heard this
[03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:51.840]  expression but
[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:53.840]  we are making
[03:08:53.840 --> 03:08:55.840]  America great again
[03:08:55.840 --> 03:08:57.840]  you haven't heard that.
[03:08:57.840 --> 03:08:59.840]  I want to
[03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:01.840]  I want to have them
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:03.840]  get up and get the glamour and the glory
[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:05.840]  and I just want to have a few of them come
[03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:07.840]  up and they'll speak for a little while
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:09.840]  and all the cowards will be associated
[03:09:09.840 --> 03:09:11.840]  with us. They're learning
[03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:13.840]  they're the losers. Get everybody up right
[03:09:13.840 --> 03:09:15.840]  but I want to thank
[03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:17.840]  Mitch McConnell. I want to
[03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:19.840]  thank what a job
[03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:21.840]  what a job
[03:09:21.840 --> 03:09:23.840]  and I want to thank Paul they're going to speak
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:25.840]  they're going to say a few words but
[03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:27.840]  Paul Ryan and Mitch it was
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:29.840]  a little team we just got together and we
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:31.840]  would work very hard didn't we
[03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:33.840]  huh it seems like
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:35.840]  it was a lot of fun it's always a lot of fun
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:37.840]  when you win
[03:09:37.840 --> 03:09:39.840]  but I
[03:09:39.840 --> 03:09:41.840]  I'm just going to name a few names and then some
[03:09:41.840 --> 03:09:43.840]  of them will come up but people that
[03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:45.840]  I saw so much over the last month
[03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:47.840]  and really over the last almost
[03:09:47.840 --> 03:09:49.840]  coming off America's net think of it we haven't
[03:09:49.840 --> 03:09:51.840]  even you think we've got stuff done now
[03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:53.840]  we did the largest tax cut
[03:09:53.840 --> 03:09:55.840]  in our history we I hate
[03:09:55.840 --> 03:09:57.840]  to say this but we essentially
[03:09:57.840 --> 03:09:59.840]  repealed Obamacare
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:01.840]  because we got rid of the individual mandate
[03:10:01.840 --> 03:10:03.840]  which is terrible yeah
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:05.840]  yeah that was a primary
[03:10:05.840 --> 03:10:07.840]  source of funding of Obamacare
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:09.840]  here's to the globalist and Anwar
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:11.840]  so a friend of mine
[03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:13.840]  congratulations
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:15.840]  congratulations
[03:10:15.840 --> 03:10:17.840]  congratulations
[03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:19.840]  and Don too
[03:10:19.840 --> 03:10:21.840]  and this is
[03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:23.840]  this is this is devastating
[03:10:23.840 --> 03:10:25.840]  I'll tell you between
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:27.840]  Dan and Don and Lisa
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:29.840]  you've done a very
[03:10:29.840 --> 03:10:31.840]  great job so a friend of mine called up about
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:33.840]  Anwar he's in the office he said
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:35.840]  you didn't get Anwar
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:37.840]  and I said tell me about Anwar
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:39.840]  he said we've been trying to get that passed
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:41.840]  the whole country the world
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:43.840]  they tried and Ronald Reagan
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:45.840]  they tried with the bushes they tried with everybody
[03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:47.840]  they never got Anwar
[03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:49.840]  but we got Anwar in this bill so we have
[03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:51.840]  Anwar we have the mandate
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:53.840]  and we have the tax cut and we have the reform
[03:10:53.840 --> 03:10:55.840]  and when you add up the size of this bill
[03:10:55.840 --> 03:10:57.840]  it's really great so Lisa thank you very much

[03:11:11.840 --> 03:11:13.840]  he's going to say a few words
[03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:17.840]  now they're probably behind the scenes
[03:11:17.840 --> 03:11:19.840]  trying to collaborate on what to do
[03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:21.840]  he's younger than I is
[03:11:21.840 --> 03:11:23.840]  this guy's a good guy
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:27.840]  I have it mostly memorized
[03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:29.840]  but Tim Scott has been great
[03:11:29.840 --> 03:11:31.840]  John Thune

[03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:29.840]  implodes the last two weeks
[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:31.840]  and on the heels of that now dish
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:33.840]  the economy roaring back I mean they are
[03:12:33.840 --> 03:12:35.840]  literally crapping their globalist britches right now
[03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:37.840]  what do you expect to happen next though
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:39.840]  they never give up the zombies
[03:12:39.840 --> 03:12:41.840]  the America haters never get up
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:43.840]  as we remove the foot off America's neck right now
[03:12:43.840 --> 03:12:45.840]  as the economy surges back
[03:12:45.840 --> 03:12:47.840]  they're just flipping out
[03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:49.840]  Alex we've just
[03:12:49.840 --> 03:12:51.840]  witnessed a historic moment
[03:12:51.840 --> 03:12:53.840]  I mean this is
[03:12:53.840 --> 03:12:55.840]  the linchpin to making America great
[03:12:55.840 --> 03:12:57.840]  again this is the linchpin
[03:12:57.840 --> 03:12:59.840]  to super charging our economy
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:01.840]  look how much the president has already
[03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:03.840]  accomplished just by cutting regulation
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:05.840]  but now with he's on his way
[03:13:05.840 --> 03:13:07.840]  towards Washington part two
[03:13:07.840 --> 03:13:09.840]  George Washington founded the country
[03:13:09.840 --> 03:13:11.840]  Donald Trump saves the country I mean it's here
[03:13:11.840 --> 03:13:13.840]  and I know
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:15.840]  for a fact that the president was actively
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:17.840]  involved in trying to keep the
[03:13:17.840 --> 03:13:19.840]  Wall Street you know Christmas
[03:13:19.840 --> 03:13:21.840]  tree provisions from being attached
[03:13:21.840 --> 03:13:23.840]  to this bill and I know
[03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:25.840]  at the very last minute he tried
[03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:27.840]  to reason with Congressman Brady
[03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:29.840]  to drop the
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:31.840]  the carried interest
[03:13:31.840 --> 03:13:33.840]  benefits for the hedge fund
[03:13:33.840 --> 03:13:35.840]  directors true to his word
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:37.840]  in the campaign and he
[03:13:37.840 --> 03:13:39.840]  kept the Wall Street sweeteners
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:41.840]  to a minimum but the most important
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:43.840]  thing to understand is that
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:45.840]  now under Donald Trump we
[03:13:45.840 --> 03:13:47.840]  have a tax rate on all businesses
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:49.840]  big and small
[03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:51.840]  lower than Mexico
[03:13:51.840 --> 03:13:53.840]  lower than Canada
[03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:55.840]  lower than China
[03:13:55.840 --> 03:13:57.840]  lower than Japan
[03:13:57.840 --> 03:13:59.840]  and this as
[03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:01.840]  CNBC's Larry Kudlow has pointed out again and again
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:03.840]  is the absolute key
[03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:05.840]  to America's economic
[03:14:05.840 --> 03:14:07.840]  revitalization and no
[03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:09.840]  nobody but Donald Trump could have gotten
[03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:11.840]  this done nobody
[03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:13.840]  and in all honesty we came
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:15.840]  this close to failure
[03:14:15.840 --> 03:14:17.840]  because John McCain
[03:14:17.840 --> 03:14:19.840]  was the last guy to sign on
[03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:21.840]  John McCain seriously
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:23.840]  entertained voting against this
[03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:25.840]  package until
[03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:27.840]  the 11th hour
[03:14:27.840 --> 03:14:29.840]  but only Donald Trump
[03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:31.840]  could have gotten this done
[03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:33.840]  and when you
[03:14:33.840 --> 03:14:35.840]  notice that it's happening in real
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:37.840]  time at the same time
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:39.840]  the Mueller investigation
[03:14:39.840 --> 03:14:41.840]  is that literally
[03:14:41.840 --> 03:14:43.840]  falling apart before our very
[03:14:43.840 --> 03:14:45.840]  eyes every single
[03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:47.840]  day brings new revelations about
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:49.840]  the inherent corruption
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:51.840]  and partisanship of
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:53.840]  the Mueller
[03:14:53.840 --> 03:14:55.840]  class. Totally synthetic and fake in a frame
[03:14:55.840 --> 03:14:57.840]  up as a cabal.
[03:14:57.840 --> 03:14:59.840]  And it's very clear
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:01.840]  we as you know posted yesterday on
[03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:03.840]  Infowars the entire blueprint
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:05.840]  for Uranium One
[03:15:05.840 --> 03:15:07.840]  we really
[03:15:07.840 --> 03:15:09.840]  laid out in chapter and verse
[03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:11.840]  how the very criminals
[03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:13.840]  are currently trying to take
[03:15:13.840 --> 03:15:15.840]  our president down. Robert
[03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:17.840]  Mueller, James Comey
[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:19.840]  Andrew McCabe
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:21.840]  Rod Rosenstein
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:23.840]  these are the criminals involved
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:25.840]  in the cover up of the
[03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:27.840]  all these former FBI deputy directors and folks
[03:15:27.840 --> 03:15:29.840]  are saying they're criminal and they need to be
[03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:31.840]  indicted so that's exciting. Rod's shotgun
[03:15:31.840 --> 03:15:33.840]  where this Mordek serves the live speech
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:35.840]  we're going back to Melissa to finish up
[03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:37.840]  on the flu and all the rest of it
[03:15:37.840 --> 03:15:39.840]  we'll go to Brad, we'll go to Scott, we'll go to everybody
[03:15:39.840 --> 03:15:41.840]  and all the other transmission hands
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:43.840]  if I got to go right into the war room with Owen Schroyer
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:45.840]  Dr. Ribbs tried the shotgun

[03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:53.840]  The house
[03:17:53.840 --> 03:17:55.840]  passed a sweeping $1.5
[03:17:55.840 --> 03:17:57.840]  trillion tax bill Tuesday.
[03:17:57.840 --> 03:17:59.840]  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowers
[03:17:59.840 --> 03:18:01.840]  individual tax rates. Paul
[03:18:01.840 --> 03:18:03.840]  Ryan said, today we are giving the
[03:18:03.840 --> 03:18:05.840]  people their money back, adding
[03:18:05.840 --> 03:18:07.840]  that a typical family would average
[03:18:07.840 --> 03:18:09.840]  about $2,000 in tax cuts
[03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:11.840]  in 2018. Zero
[03:18:11.840 --> 03:18:13.840]  Democrats voted to lower taxes.
[03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:15.840]  Instead they were busy pushing the
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:17.840]  narrative that the sloppy bill is a
[03:18:17.840 --> 03:18:19.840]  Frankenmonster set to benefit only
[03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:21.840]  corporations and the rich. But are
[03:18:21.840 --> 03:18:23.840]  they really just worried about a
[03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:25.840]  legislative accomplishment that will
[03:18:25.840 --> 03:18:27.840]  translate to more cold hard cash for
[03:18:27.840 --> 03:18:29.840]  governments? According to the
[03:18:29.840 --> 03:18:31.840]  Independent Tax Policy Center,
[03:18:31.840 --> 03:18:33.840]  80% of taxpayers will get a
[03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:35.840]  tax cut in 2018.
[03:18:35.840 --> 03:18:37.840]  Only about 5% will pay more
[03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:39.840]  next year under the GOP plan.
[03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:41.840]  With approval from both chambers
[03:18:41.840 --> 03:18:43.840]  likely, the biggest overhaul of the
[03:18:43.840 --> 03:18:45.840]  US tax system in more than 30
[03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:47.840]  years could be signed into law
[03:18:47.840 --> 03:18:49.840]  by President Trump before the
[03:18:49.840 --> 03:18:51.840]  end of the week. Leigh Ann

[03:18:53.840 --> 03:18:55.840]  I want to plow into all of this

[03:19:43.840 --> 03:19:45.840]  globalists and their satanic pedophile armies
[03:19:45.840 --> 03:19:47.840]  and that's who they are and they know
[03:19:47.840 --> 03:19:49.840]  we know who they are and they're coming back
[03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:55.840]  and we need your support.
[03:19:55.840 --> 03:20:23.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:23.840 --> 03:20:25.840]  You take about the biggest
[03:20:25.840 --> 03:20:27.840]  tax cut in U.S. history to return
[03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:29.840]  the corporate money to the U.S.
[03:20:29.840 --> 03:20:31.840]  and kill the globalist program
[03:20:31.840 --> 03:20:33.840]  to deindustrialize our nation.
[03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:35.840]  We now take you there live. More of your
[03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:37.840]  phone calls, Roger Stone and of course
[03:20:37.840 --> 03:20:39.840]  Dr. Group Writing Shot and we're going back to your calls in a moment
[03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:41.840]  but here's a few more minutes of the historic speeches.
[03:20:41.840 --> 03:20:43.840]  What about ways to
[03:20:43.840 --> 03:20:45.840]  improve distressed communities
[03:20:45.840 --> 03:20:47.840]  throughout this country?
[03:20:47.840 --> 03:20:49.840]  52 million Americans
[03:20:49.840 --> 03:20:51.840]  living in distressed communities and we talked
[03:20:51.840 --> 03:20:53.840]  about legislation that can move
[03:20:53.840 --> 03:20:55.840]  those communities forward
[03:20:55.840 --> 03:20:57.840]  and you said yes
[03:20:57.840 --> 03:20:59.840]  and as a part of this tax reform package
[03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:01.840]  the investing and opportunity act
[03:21:01.840 --> 03:21:03.840]  has been included
[03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:05.840]  which will bring
[03:21:05.840 --> 03:21:07.840]  trillions of dollars
[03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:09.840]  into poor communities because of your
[03:21:09.840 --> 03:21:11.840]  willingness
[03:21:11.840 --> 03:21:13.840]  to listen.
[03:21:13.840 --> 03:21:15.840]  Thank you.
[03:21:15.840 --> 03:21:17.840]  Factories and jobs are going to rain
[03:21:17.840 --> 03:21:19.840]  on black people
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:21.840]  and of course that's why the global
[03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:23.840]  president said we have about 25 more minutes
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:25.840]  so I'm going to get to mine.
[03:21:29.840 --> 03:21:31.840]  He didn't say that. Okay, got it.
[03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:33.840]  Let me just say to
[03:21:33.840 --> 03:21:35.840]  those Americans who are
[03:21:35.840 --> 03:21:37.840]  watching this process
[03:21:37.840 --> 03:21:39.840]  this is not about Washington.
[03:21:39.840 --> 03:21:41.840]  It's not about the left.
[03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:43.840]  It's not about the right.
[03:21:43.840 --> 03:21:45.840]  It's about
[03:21:45.840 --> 03:21:47.840]  single parent moms
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:49.840]  who are looking for
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:51.840]  reason to be hopeful in
[03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:53.840]  2018.
[03:21:53.840 --> 03:21:55.840]  This tax reform plan
[03:21:55.840 --> 03:21:57.840]  delivers for the average
[03:21:57.840 --> 03:21:59.840]  single mother
[03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:01.840]  a 70 percent
[03:22:01.840 --> 03:22:03.840]  tax cut
[03:22:03.840 --> 03:22:05.840]  for the average family
[03:22:05.840 --> 03:22:07.840]  who's working paycheck to paycheck
[03:22:07.840 --> 03:22:09.840]  looking for ways
[03:22:09.840 --> 03:22:11.840]  to be hopeful
[03:22:11.840 --> 03:22:13.840]  about their future. To have an extra
[03:22:13.840 --> 03:22:15.840]  night for dinner out of the restaurants
[03:22:15.840 --> 03:22:17.840]  this tax reform
[03:22:17.840 --> 03:22:19.840]  package cuts their
[03:22:19.840 --> 03:22:21.840]  taxes by nearly
[03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:23.840]  60 percent.
[03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:25.840]  And because of folks like Marco Rubio
[03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:27.840]  and Ivanka
[03:22:27.840 --> 03:22:29.840]  when you think about the folks
[03:22:29.840 --> 03:22:31.840]  with kids in the household
[03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:33.840]  this plan
[03:22:33.840 --> 03:22:35.840]  doubles the child tax credit
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:37.840]  and makes about 70 percent
[03:22:37.840 --> 03:22:39.840]  of it refundable.
[03:22:39.840 --> 03:22:41.840]  This is a plan that we can be proud of
[03:22:41.840 --> 03:22:43.840]  because it speaks to the hearts
[03:22:43.840 --> 03:22:45.840]  of every day America.
[03:22:45.840 --> 03:22:47.840]  Just the estate tax
[03:22:47.840 --> 03:22:49.840]  is devastating to the global.
[03:22:51.840 --> 03:22:53.840]  Let's turn
[03:22:53.840 --> 03:22:55.840]  Come on up, Diane Black.
[03:22:55.840 --> 03:22:57.840]  I want to go back to Roger Stone.
[03:22:57.840 --> 03:22:59.840]  He had some guests set up.
[03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:01.840]  Let me go into the war room.
[03:23:01.840 --> 03:23:03.840]  This is too historic and I promise to go to your calls
[03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:05.840]  but we're going back to Melissa here
[03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:07.840]  just a minute but Roger thanks for letting me
[03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:09.840]  storm the fourth hour with you.
[03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:11.840]  Again, what are the dims going to do?
[03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:13.840]  I had a whole family last night.
[03:23:13.840 --> 03:23:15.840]  Four men, three women
[03:23:15.840 --> 03:23:17.840]  come up and say
[03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:19.840]  I'm going to prison. You're a Russian. We hate you.
[03:23:19.840 --> 03:23:21.840]  We're going to get you.
[03:23:21.840 --> 03:23:23.840]  Screw your baby. Screw your wife.
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:25.840]  I stepped out to make a phone call
[03:23:25.840 --> 03:23:27.840]  that I guess they'd seen us at the restaurant
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:29.840]  eating. I mean they were just frothing
[03:23:29.840 --> 03:23:31.840]  and to see me happy.
[03:23:31.840 --> 03:23:33.840]  Then they said, oh you got that hot young thing.
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:35.840]  They were just
[03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:37.840]  my wife's five years younger than me.
[03:23:37.840 --> 03:23:39.840]  They were foaming at the mouth, Roger.
[03:23:39.840 --> 03:23:41.840]  Well, you know, Alex, the cool thing is
[03:23:41.840 --> 03:23:43.840]  that for every one of those examples
[03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:45.840]  I had lunch today in a local pizzeria here
[03:23:45.840 --> 03:23:47.840]  in Austin and I was
[03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:49.840]  mobbed by info warriors.
[03:23:49.840 --> 03:23:51.840]  Oh no, no, exactly. We're 10 to 1.
[03:23:51.840 --> 03:23:53.840]  You tell Alex Jones, God bless him.
[03:23:53.840 --> 03:23:55.840]  He is leading the American Revolution.
[03:23:55.840 --> 03:23:57.840]  You tell the whole crew at Info Wars
[03:23:57.840 --> 03:23:59.840]  how much we love what you guys are doing.
[03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:01.840]  I signed autographs and
[03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:03.840]  I posed four selfies.
[03:24:03.840 --> 03:24:05.840]  So look, as you know, it's a balance.
[03:24:05.840 --> 03:24:07.840]  The Lib Tards attacked me on the streets.
[03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:09.840]  You've got this clown Tom Arnold
[03:24:09.840 --> 03:24:11.840]  cyber stalking me whenever I
[03:24:11.840 --> 03:24:13.840]  go to a restaurant in Manhattan. It's like
[03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:15.840]  go to the restaurant. You can confront Roger Stone.
[03:24:15.840 --> 03:24:17.840]  No, the liberals, their heads are
[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:19.840]  are exploding because
[03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:21.840]  the Trump Revolution is succeeding
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:23.840]  because we are winning
[03:24:23.840 --> 03:24:25.840]  because their heroes, Mueller,
[03:24:25.840 --> 03:24:27.840]  Comey, Hillary, Bill,
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:29.840]  they're being exposed as the
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:31.840]  venal treasonous criminals
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:33.840]  that they are.
[03:24:33.840 --> 03:24:35.840]  The forces of freedom are on the move.
[03:24:35.840 --> 03:24:37.840]  We've been so cynical.
[03:24:37.840 --> 03:24:39.840]  We've been so cynical so long
[03:24:39.840 --> 03:24:41.840]  groups always saying be positive. It's true.
[03:24:41.840 --> 03:24:43.840]  It's actually happening.
[03:24:43.840 --> 03:24:45.840]  You judge a tree by its fruits. This is incredible.
[03:24:45.840 --> 03:24:47.840]  But I asked the question. So I'm glad he points out
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:49.840]  10 to 1. It's positive. But I'm worried about
[03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:51.840]  that percentage that are getting crazier.
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:53.840]  What do you say about them?
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:24:55.840]  Well, you and I
[03:24:55.840 --> 03:24:57.840]  went to a shooting range
[03:24:57.840 --> 03:24:59.840]  yesterday so I could get some basic
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:01.840]  training on firearms.
[03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:03.840]  Growing up in an
[03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:05.840]  urban area, I never had the opportunity
[03:25:05.840 --> 03:25:07.840]  to learn
[03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:09.840]  despite my respect for the Second Amendment
[03:25:09.840 --> 03:25:11.840]  and my respect for firearms and their
[03:25:11.840 --> 03:25:13.840]  proper use. I never had the
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:15.840]  opportunity. It was a great experience.
[03:25:15.840 --> 03:25:17.840]  And the reason I'm doing this, Alex, is because
[03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:19.840]  the threat level
[03:25:19.840 --> 03:25:21.840]  against me and my family
[03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:23.840]  and my dogs
[03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:25.840]  has just gotten out of control.
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:27.840]  I can't go to a major urban
[03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:29.840]  center in the country. I can't walk through
[03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:31.840]  an airport. I can't go to a restaurant
[03:25:31.840 --> 03:25:33.840]  with some
[03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:35.840]  libtards screaming at me that they're going to kill
[03:25:35.840 --> 03:25:37.840]  me, that my family will die in
[03:25:37.840 --> 03:25:39.840]  jail. I'm sick of it.
[03:25:39.840 --> 03:25:41.840]  And I'm not a violent person.
[03:25:41.840 --> 03:25:43.840]  We don't advocate
[03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:45.840]  or foment violence.
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:47.840]  But we will not be
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:49.840]  violated. And we will protect
[03:25:49.840 --> 03:25:51.840]  our families and our Constitution.
[03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:53.840]  So the fringe you're talking about, Alex,
[03:25:53.840 --> 03:25:55.840]  the real nut jobs
[03:25:55.840 --> 03:25:57.840]  on the left, they're
[03:25:57.840 --> 03:25:59.840]  driven now to violence.
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:01.840]  They're so insane about the success
[03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:03.840]  of this administration.
[03:26:03.840 --> 03:26:05.840]  That's right, Dr. Grubb.
[03:26:05.840 --> 03:26:07.840]  What do you think we are historically?
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:09.840]  I think we're making progress historically.
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:11.840]  I mean, massive progress with this.
[03:26:11.840 --> 03:26:13.840]  I mean, this is
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:15.840]  America's
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:17.840]  best Christmas gift
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:19.840]  probably since George Washington.
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:21.840]  By the way, we're not
[03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:23.840]  just using those terms. You have to go
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:25.840]  this is super level.
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:27.840]  I'm saying Christmas, not
[03:26:27.840 --> 03:26:29.840]  being, you know, being.
[03:26:29.840 --> 03:26:31.840]  No, but I agree. This is like mega historical.
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:33.840]  This is mega historical.
[03:26:33.840 --> 03:26:35.840]  Yeah. No, I mean, I think it's great.
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:37.840]  I think that everything is
[03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:39.840]  finally starting to take
[03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:41.840]  those steps in a positive direction
[03:26:41.840 --> 03:26:43.840]  and what we need to do to get
[03:26:43.840 --> 03:26:45.840]  reclaim our freedom in this country.
[03:26:45.840 --> 03:26:47.840]  Again, we're pretty much just
[03:26:47.840 --> 03:26:49.840]  as almost a socialist republic.
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:51.840]  The only thing left was to take away
[03:26:51.840 --> 03:26:53.840]  our guns and the Second Amendment.
[03:26:53.840 --> 03:26:55.840]  So now this is this is a huge,
[03:26:55.840 --> 03:26:57.840]  huge win.
[03:26:57.840 --> 03:26:59.840]  A huge victory.
[03:26:59.840 --> 03:27:01.840]  Did you see how Chicago wants you in troops?
[03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:03.840]  Yes, I did see how Chicago
[03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:05.840]  wanted you in troops. That's
[03:27:05.840 --> 03:27:07.840]  you know,
[03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:09.840]  they're pulling out all the stops
[03:27:09.840 --> 03:27:11.840]  right now. I mean, it's so crazy.
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:13.840]  It is crazy. It is crazy.
[03:27:13.840 --> 03:27:15.840]  I mean, I don't even know
[03:27:15.840 --> 03:27:17.840]  what's going on with uranium one. I haven't read
[03:27:17.840 --> 03:27:19.840]  Rogers. It's just
[03:27:19.840 --> 03:27:21.840]  all state. They were dumb enough to admit
[03:27:21.840 --> 03:27:23.840]  text messages and emails. It's all fake.
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:25.840]  Well, it's like everything that they're doing
[03:27:25.840 --> 03:27:27.840]  is starting to become exposed.
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:29.840]  You know, the more that they try to
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:31.840]  expose things that aren't there
[03:27:31.840 --> 03:27:33.840]  like the Russian
[03:27:33.840 --> 03:27:35.840]  like Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:37.840]  and Alex Jones and Matt Rudge and
[03:27:37.840 --> 03:27:39.840]  Roger Stone and Russ and agents.
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:41.840]  That's true. I'm a monkey's uncle. Exactly.
[03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:43.840]  I mean, I do like
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:45.840]  the irony here, of course, Alex
[03:27:45.840 --> 03:27:47.840]  is that
[03:27:47.840 --> 03:27:49.840]  they were so smug
[03:27:49.840 --> 03:27:51.840]  about Hillary's election.
[03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:53.840]  The fix was in. You see,
[03:27:53.840 --> 03:27:55.840]  we were going to have Hillary versus Jeb.
[03:27:55.840 --> 03:27:57.840]  We control both of them.
[03:27:57.840 --> 03:27:59.840]  Jeb's assignment was to lose gracefully
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:01.840]  and he would continue to make millions
[03:28:01.840 --> 03:28:03.840]  after his associations with the Clintons.
[03:28:03.840 --> 03:28:05.840]  So they were so brazen. They were so
[03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:07.840]  arrogant that they exchanged
[03:28:07.840 --> 03:28:09.840]  these emails on their official
[03:28:09.840 --> 03:28:11.840]  email and text message
[03:28:11.840 --> 03:28:13.840]  channels on their government-owned
[03:28:13.840 --> 03:28:15.840]  cell phones because
[03:28:15.840 --> 03:28:17.840]  they'll never see them. We'll be able to cover this
[03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:19.840]  all up. And now it's
[03:28:19.840 --> 03:28:21.840]  all out there for the American people to see.
[03:28:21.840 --> 03:28:23.840]  Trump's election is so
[03:28:23.840 --> 03:28:25.840]  improbable. They're going out of their minds.
[03:28:25.840 --> 03:28:27.840]  We'll be back
[03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:29.840]  in just a minute and I want to talk about some of these
[03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:31.840]  incredible specials you've got going on

[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:39.840]  They understand that we

[03:34:11.840 --> 03:34:13.840]  It came in, so that's here, the great
[03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:15.840]  anti-fungal. Brad,
[03:34:15.840 --> 03:34:17.840]  Melissa,
[03:34:17.840 --> 03:34:19.840]  let's finish up. Melissa, what was your other point?
[03:34:21.840 --> 03:34:23.840]  I just want to finish off with,
[03:34:23.840 --> 03:34:25.840]  we live in a small town
[03:34:25.840 --> 03:34:27.840]  in northern Nevada. It's a big
[03:34:27.840 --> 03:34:29.840]  ranching community.
[03:34:29.840 --> 03:34:31.840]  I just want people to know that. It doesn't
[03:34:31.840 --> 03:34:33.840]  matter where you live.
[03:34:33.840 --> 03:34:35.840]  They're going to come after you regardless, especially on
[03:34:35.840 --> 03:34:37.840]  these vaccines. Recap, if folks
[03:34:37.840 --> 03:34:39.840]  just joined us, you were on 20 minutes ago and I put
[03:34:39.840 --> 03:34:41.840]  them on hold.
[03:34:41.840 --> 03:34:43.840]  They're saying it's the law take shots. They're trying
[03:34:43.840 --> 03:34:45.840]  to harass your daughter in
[03:34:45.840 --> 03:34:47.840]  class.
[03:34:47.840 --> 03:34:49.840]  They're singling her out in her
[03:34:49.840 --> 03:34:51.840]  classes. Bullying her.
[03:34:51.840 --> 03:34:53.840]  She needs to get these done.
[03:34:53.840 --> 03:34:55.840]  I was called a bad mom
[03:34:55.840 --> 03:34:57.840]  by every administrator
[03:34:57.840 --> 03:34:59.840]  and nurse that I talked to when I refused
[03:34:59.840 --> 03:35:01.840]  to get the meningitis shot for her.
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:03.840]  That's adult bullying.
[03:35:03.840 --> 03:35:05.840]  That's adult bullying.
[03:35:05.840 --> 03:35:07.840]  Have I heard stories like that?
[03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:09.840]  Not only are they forcing
[03:35:09.840 --> 03:35:11.840]  vaccines, they're also forcing
[03:35:11.840 --> 03:35:13.840]  mental health tests on children
[03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:15.840]  and it's being done behind the parents
[03:35:15.840 --> 03:35:17.840]  backs. They want all the children
[03:35:17.840 --> 03:35:19.840]  to be diagnosed
[03:35:19.840 --> 03:35:21.840]  with some sort of mental disorder. They want them
[03:35:21.840 --> 03:35:23.840]  all on psychiatric medications
[03:35:23.840 --> 03:35:25.840]  and they want to have full control
[03:35:25.840 --> 03:35:27.840]  over everybody moving forward from this
[03:35:27.840 --> 03:35:29.840]  point on.
[03:35:29.840 --> 03:35:31.840]  Way to go for standing up because
[03:35:31.840 --> 03:35:33.840]  you're only one of millions
[03:35:33.840 --> 03:35:35.840]  of parents that succumb to the pressure
[03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:37.840]  and millions of kids that succumb to the pressure.
[03:35:37.840 --> 03:35:39.840]  Thank you. God bless you.
[03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:41.840]  Thank you. Merry Christmas
[03:35:41.840 --> 03:35:43.840]  to all of you.
[03:35:43.840 --> 03:35:45.840]  To you too.
[03:35:45.840 --> 03:35:47.840]  They know
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:49.840]  that the higher educated, the less vaccines
[03:35:49.840 --> 03:35:51.840]  people take.
[03:35:51.840 --> 03:35:53.840]  We've played those reports, but here's
[03:35:53.840 --> 03:35:55.840]  the deal. I know there could be a safe vaccine system
[03:35:55.840 --> 03:35:57.840]  still with some side effects, but they
[03:35:57.840 --> 03:35:59.840]  have total protection, liability protection.
[03:35:59.840 --> 03:36:01.840]  They lie about it all.
[03:36:01.840 --> 03:36:03.840]  They're trying to force it on us.
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:05.840]  We've got to go to these calls or we'll never
[03:36:05.840 --> 03:36:07.840]  get to them, but that's one thing
[03:36:07.840 --> 03:36:09.840]  he hasn't let us down yet because he's not
[03:36:09.840 --> 03:36:11.840]  even a year in and we see half of his
[03:36:11.840 --> 03:36:13.840]  agenda already in place, but
[03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:15.840]  he did create that commission with Robert Kennedy
[03:36:15.840 --> 03:36:17.840]  Jr. He did say, hey,
[03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:19.840]  we've had issues with vaccines. They're giving too many
[03:36:19.840 --> 03:36:21.840]  too quick. You know, Trump can even see the effects
[03:36:21.840 --> 03:36:23.840]  himself. That's one thing I hope he starts
[03:36:23.840 --> 03:36:25.840]  delivering on soon. He is
[03:36:25.840 --> 03:36:27.840]  exposing the vaccines. Roger.
[03:36:27.840 --> 03:36:29.840]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[03:36:29.840 --> 03:36:31.840]  I think that Big Pharma
[03:36:31.840 --> 03:36:33.840]  has obviously pushed back against the idea
[03:36:33.840 --> 03:36:35.840]  of a commission.
[03:36:35.840 --> 03:36:37.840]  Robert Kennedy Jr.,
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:39.840]  who I spoke to the other day,
[03:36:39.840 --> 03:36:41.840]  is more than willing to serve,
[03:36:41.840 --> 03:36:43.840]  but he's not hearing from the White House.
[03:36:43.840 --> 03:36:45.840]  So in the new year,
[03:36:45.840 --> 03:36:47.840]  we need to give the president the support
[03:36:47.840 --> 03:36:49.840]  he needs to overcome
[03:36:49.840 --> 03:36:51.840]  the opposition within his own
[03:36:51.840 --> 03:36:53.840]  administration to those who I think
[03:36:53.840 --> 03:36:55.840]  are in the pocket of Big Pharma.
[03:36:55.840 --> 03:36:57.840]  We need a blue ribbon commission
[03:36:57.840 --> 03:36:59.840]  of honest people to look
[03:36:59.840 --> 03:37:01.840]  into the safety of these vaccinations.
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:03.840]  We need to expand on that.
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:05.840]  That's why they hate him going on the road.
[03:37:05.840 --> 03:37:07.840]  That's why they try to isolate him. If you hand
[03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:09.840]  him an article or say, sure, vaccines,
[03:37:09.840 --> 03:37:11.840]  remember, please fulfill your pledge.
[03:37:11.840 --> 03:37:13.840]  He does it. That's why they keep him
[03:37:13.840 --> 03:37:15.840]  isolated. Hit him on Twitter.
[03:37:15.840 --> 03:37:17.840]  Call Sean Hannity, who he talks
[03:37:17.840 --> 03:37:19.840]  to every night.
[03:37:19.840 --> 03:37:21.840]  Sean Hannity is powerful. I might like to host
[03:37:21.840 --> 03:37:23.840]  a God in the Big or something best. Sean Hannity's
[03:37:23.840 --> 03:37:25.840]  gotten a lot better. He's really a patriot.
[03:37:25.840 --> 03:37:27.840]  Thank God for Sean Hannity.
[03:37:27.840 --> 03:37:29.840]  He gets Sean Hannity on this, right, Roger?
[03:37:29.840 --> 03:37:31.840]  No, look, I think the more voices
[03:37:31.840 --> 03:37:33.840]  the president hears it from. The president's
[03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:35.840]  instincts are absolutely correct.
[03:37:35.840 --> 03:37:37.840]  He understands the danger of these
[03:37:37.840 --> 03:37:39.840]  vaccinations. He's expressed it
[03:37:39.840 --> 03:37:41.840]  publicly for a number of years.
[03:37:41.840 --> 03:37:43.840]  But then the, you know,
[03:37:43.840 --> 03:37:45.840]  the establishment
[03:37:45.840 --> 03:37:47.840]  health
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:49.840]  Nazis within the
[03:37:49.840 --> 03:37:51.840]  government swoop in and say, that's
[03:37:51.840 --> 03:37:53.840]  crazy. That's insane. Vaccines
[03:37:53.840 --> 03:37:55.840]  are safe. Adam Schiff,
[03:37:55.840 --> 03:37:57.840]  the congressman from
[03:37:57.840 --> 03:37:59.840]  California, you know,
[03:37:59.840 --> 03:38:01.840]  Congressman Schiffless, he sponsors
[03:38:01.840 --> 03:38:03.840]  legislation, House of the Resolution
[03:38:03.840 --> 03:38:05.840]  that declares
[03:38:05.840 --> 03:38:07.840]  vaccines are absolutely safe.
[03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:09.840]  The United States government has never
[03:38:09.840 --> 03:38:11.840]  paid out a single penny
[03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:13.840]  to people damaged by vaccinations.
[03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:15.840]  We've paid out
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:17.840]  over 3.5 billion
[03:38:17.840 --> 03:38:19.840]  dollars. The insert said they could kill
[03:38:19.840 --> 03:38:21.840]  you dead in a hammer. I know, it's
[03:38:21.840 --> 03:38:23.840]  like, hoax fill. The good news is
[03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:25.840]  they're having to resort to pure hoaxes.
[03:38:25.840 --> 03:38:27.840]  It's delusional. It would be
[03:38:27.840 --> 03:38:29.840]  like sponsoring legislation that says
[03:38:29.840 --> 03:38:31.840]  the Holocaust never happened
[03:38:31.840 --> 03:38:33.840]  and no one really died.
[03:38:33.840 --> 03:38:35.840]  It's insane, it's so crazy.
[03:38:35.840 --> 03:38:37.840]  Insane. Brad,
[03:38:37.840 --> 03:38:39.840]  you're on the air worldwide
[03:38:39.840 --> 03:38:41.840]  with Dr. Group. Go ahead.
[03:38:41.840 --> 03:38:43.840]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[03:38:43.840 --> 03:38:45.840]  And hey, Dr. Group and Roger, great
[03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:47.840]  show. I just wanted to echo
[03:38:47.840 --> 03:38:49.840]  what you're just saying there because, you know,
[03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:51.840]  when I was, when my wife
[03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:53.840]  and I had our children, you know, I
[03:38:53.840 --> 03:38:55.840]  would have done, you know, it's a whole different
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:38:57.840]  level of experience when you have kids. You do
[03:38:57.840 --> 03:38:59.840]  anything to protect them. And we're all
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:01.840]  told you got to get them vaccinated
[03:39:01.840 --> 03:39:03.840]  right away. You got to do this. So you go
[03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:05.840]  through that process. And I brought
[03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:07.840]  my daughter home and she had some
[03:39:07.840 --> 03:39:09.840]  convulsions from the year and a half
[03:39:09.840 --> 03:39:11.840]  shots, I think. And after that,
[03:39:11.840 --> 03:39:13.840]  I was wide awake. And of course, I was listening
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:15.840]  to you about that time because it was right around 9-11.
[03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:17.840]  So I just, you know,
[03:39:17.840 --> 03:39:19.840]  people talk about you fear mongering
[03:39:19.840 --> 03:39:21.840]  whatever, Alex, you're the best, man. You
[03:39:21.840 --> 03:39:23.840]  put out the best information.
[03:39:23.840 --> 03:39:25.840]  I've been a news junkie since I was a kid.
[03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:27.840]  Got hooked up
[03:39:27.840 --> 03:39:29.840]  listening to you after 9-11 and
[03:39:29.840 --> 03:39:31.840]  awoken. By the way, I'm not getting tears
[03:39:31.840 --> 03:39:33.840]  in my eyes about you talking about me. It
[03:39:33.840 --> 03:39:35.840]  makes me violent that they know this is hurting
[03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:37.840]  kids. And they don't do anything about it.
[03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:39.840]  And it pisses me off. And they don't
[03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:41.840]  do anything about it. They just keep pushing the same narrative.
[03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:43.840]  I was just listening to you guys
[03:39:43.840 --> 03:39:45.840]  talk a minute ago. You go back to the 50s
[03:39:45.840 --> 03:39:47.840]  and they were pushing
[03:39:47.840 --> 03:39:49.840]  polio the same way. So this has history
[03:39:49.840 --> 03:39:51.840]  all this time. My grandmother, they told
[03:39:51.840 --> 03:39:53.840]  her she got it from a polio vaccine.
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:55.840]  And then these people get in my face telling me
[03:39:55.840 --> 03:39:57.840]  I'm full of crap about it.
[03:39:57.840 --> 03:39:59.840]  They're putting profit on it. I got people to work
[03:39:59.840 --> 03:40:01.840]  and they're building whose children have died
[03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:03.840]  from it. I got people that have been
[03:40:03.840 --> 03:40:05.840]  super sick from it.
[03:40:05.840 --> 03:40:07.840]  I'm sick of their crap.
[03:40:07.840 --> 03:40:09.840]  Sorry, go ahead. It's medical
[03:40:09.840 --> 03:40:11.840]  tyranny. It goes back to the 50s
[03:40:11.840 --> 03:40:13.840]  with polio. It goes back to the
[03:40:13.840 --> 03:40:15.840]  fluoride since the early 70s.
[03:40:15.840 --> 03:40:17.840]  And we just all buy it.
[03:40:17.840 --> 03:40:19.840]  The public is just clueless.
[03:40:19.840 --> 03:40:21.840]  And I'm being clueless until
[03:40:21.840 --> 03:40:23.840]  you start piecing it together like a puzzle.
[03:40:23.840 --> 03:40:25.840]  And you go, they are attacking us from
[03:40:25.840 --> 03:40:27.840]  every which direction.
[03:40:27.840 --> 03:40:29.840]  It's all departmentalized. The average nurse doesn't know.
[03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:31.840]  But the nurses always want to have them at a baby.
[03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:33.840]  I've had four of them.
[03:40:33.840 --> 03:40:35.840]  We don't give them to ourselves either.
[03:40:35.840 --> 03:40:37.840]  The premies that we give them to them, they die.
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:39.840]  Incredible. Anything else, Brad?
[03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:41.840]  Yeah, just on that note.
[03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:43.840]  I work part-time in a hospital.
[03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:45.840]  And just like you're saying, that other
[03:40:45.840 --> 03:40:47.840]  caller just said, Melissa, I think her name was,
[03:40:47.840 --> 03:40:49.840]  they said, hey,
[03:40:49.840 --> 03:40:51.840]  everybody's got to take a flu shot.
[03:40:51.840 --> 03:40:53.840]  And I said, you know what? I'm going to
[03:40:53.840 --> 03:40:55.840]  fight this. I'm not because I'm part-time.
[03:40:55.840 --> 03:40:57.840]  They could take it or leave it if they don't want me.
[03:40:57.840 --> 03:40:59.840]  I'm like, you know, I want to work there. I've been there
[03:40:59.840 --> 03:41:01.840]  15 years, but I'm not taking
[03:41:01.840 --> 03:41:03.840]  this. I'm not doing it. So I wrote this big long
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:05.840]  letter and they said, you know what, don't worry
[03:41:05.840 --> 03:41:07.840]  about it. We're putting you on exemption list for good.
[03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:09.840]  But it's okay. You know, it was stressful
[03:41:09.840 --> 03:41:11.840]  just fighting that. And on that note, Dr.
[03:41:11.840 --> 03:41:13.840]  Roop, can you possibly come up with
[03:41:13.840 --> 03:41:15.840]  some product to
[03:41:15.840 --> 03:41:17.840]  relieve stress? Because I know you're doing a great
[03:41:17.840 --> 03:41:19.840]  job with all the other products. I love them all.
[03:41:19.840 --> 03:41:21.840]  But I'm sure there's a lot of us out here
[03:41:21.840 --> 03:41:23.840]  dealing with day-to-day stress that would love a new
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:25.840]  product like that.
[03:41:25.840 --> 03:41:27.840]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, lithium orate seems
[03:41:27.840 --> 03:41:29.840]  to work pretty good. It's out there.
[03:41:29.840 --> 03:41:31.840]  But just really cleansing your body.
[03:41:31.840 --> 03:41:33.840]  It's a plant-based lithium. It's a plant-based lithium.
[03:41:33.840 --> 03:41:35.840]  It works really good for stress. But it's really more or less
[03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:37.840]  addressing the root cause of your stress
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:39.840]  where it's coming from and sleep. Just
[03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:41.840]  an hour of sleep extra a night
[03:41:41.840 --> 03:41:43.840]  has been shown to reduce stress.
[03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:45.840]  If people take knockout, that helps your brain
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:47.840]  release a lot of the other chemicals you need, right?
[03:41:47.840 --> 03:41:49.840]  Yeah, knockout's good. It's going to help
[03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:51.840]  balance the neurotransmitters.
[03:41:51.840 --> 03:41:53.840]  And actually, believe it or not,
[03:41:53.840 --> 03:41:55.840]  new research is coming out on gut health
[03:41:55.840 --> 03:41:57.840]  and how it affects stress levels. Because
[03:41:57.840 --> 03:41:59.840]  your brain and your stress with the
[03:41:59.840 --> 03:42:01.840]  adrenaline and the dopamine and the serotonin
[03:42:01.840 --> 03:42:03.840]  and all the brain, the neurotransmitters
[03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:05.840]  are actually regulated and produced
[03:42:05.840 --> 03:42:07.840]  in your gut. So,
[03:42:07.840 --> 03:42:09.840]  if you're fixing and repairing the gut,
[03:42:09.840 --> 03:42:11.840]  it has a direct relationship
[03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:13.840]  on the stress. Alright.
[03:42:13.840 --> 03:42:15.840]  We've got to come back and give each caller a minute
[03:42:15.840 --> 03:42:17.840]  and finish up with Roger Stone. And Roger,
[03:42:17.840 --> 03:42:19.840]  I know you've got to catch a plane back to Florida
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:21.840]  or New York, wherever you're going, your houses,
[03:42:21.840 --> 03:42:23.840]  right after this. Are you going to be able to be part of the
[03:42:23.840 --> 03:42:25.840]  War Room and have some of those special guests on?
[03:42:25.840 --> 03:42:27.840]  Actually, I think we're going to reschedule them
[03:42:27.840 --> 03:42:29.840]  because we've got some good news. But there's
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:31.840]  only one flight out of here and I'm going to be
[03:42:31.840 --> 03:42:33.840]  on it. It's been a great weekend, Austin.
[03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:35.840]  Just great. Absolutely.
[03:42:35.840 --> 03:42:37.840]  I have three daughters and I have a son
[03:42:37.840 --> 03:42:39.840]  and I think about my baby having convulsions
[03:42:39.840 --> 03:42:41.840]  like that father did. And I'm going to be honest,
[03:42:41.840 --> 03:42:43.840]  I feel violent. I've been
[03:42:43.840 --> 03:42:45.840]  trying to fix this peacefully. But all these
[03:42:45.840 --> 03:42:47.840]  globalists behind this, they know what
[03:42:47.840 --> 03:42:49.840]  they're doing. None of them take shots. They
[03:42:49.840 --> 03:42:51.840]  need to. You know what?
[03:42:51.840 --> 03:42:53.840]  The House passed a sweeping
[03:42:53.840 --> 03:42:55.840]  $1.5 trillion tax
[03:42:55.840 --> 03:42:57.840]  bill Tuesday. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
[03:42:57.840 --> 03:42:59.840]  lowers individual tax
[03:42:59.840 --> 03:43:01.840]  rates. Paul Ryan said,
[03:43:01.840 --> 03:43:03.840]  today we are giving the people their money
[03:43:03.840 --> 03:43:05.840]  back, adding that a typical family
[03:43:05.840 --> 03:43:07.840]  would average about $2,000
[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:09.840]  in tax cuts in 2018.
[03:43:09.840 --> 03:43:11.840]  Zero Democrats voted to
[03:43:11.840 --> 03:43:13.840]  lower taxes. Instead, they were busy
[03:43:13.840 --> 03:43:15.840]  pushing the narrative that the sloppy bill
[03:43:15.840 --> 03:43:17.840]  is a Frankenmonster set to benefit
[03:43:17.840 --> 03:43:19.840]  only corporations and the rich.
[03:43:19.840 --> 03:43:21.840]  But are they really just worried about a legislative
[03:43:21.840 --> 03:43:23.840]  accomplishment that will translate
[03:43:23.840 --> 03:43:25.840]  to more cold hard cash for
[03:43:25.840 --> 03:43:27.840]  middle-class pockets? According to the
[03:43:27.840 --> 03:43:29.840]  Independent Tax Policy Center,
[03:43:29.840 --> 03:43:31.840]  80% of tax
[03:43:31.840 --> 03:43:33.840]  payers will get a tax cut
[03:43:33.840 --> 03:43:35.840]  in 2018. Only about
[03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:37.840]  5% will pay more next year
[03:43:37.840 --> 03:43:39.840]  under the GOP plan. With approval
[03:43:39.840 --> 03:43:41.840]  from both chambers likely, the biggest
[03:43:41.840 --> 03:43:43.840]  overhaul of the U.S.
[03:43:43.840 --> 03:43:45.840]  tax system in more than 30 years
[03:43:45.840 --> 03:43:47.840]  could be signed into law by President
[03:43:47.840 --> 03:43:49.840]  Trump before the end of the week.
[03:43:49.840 --> 03:43:51.840]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, Infowars.com
[03:43:51.840 --> 03:43:53.840]  Top scientists and
[03:43:53.840 --> 03:43:55.840]  researchers agree we are
[03:43:55.840 --> 03:43:57.840]  being hit by toxic weapons
[03:43:57.840 --> 03:43:59.840]  in the food and water supply
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:01.840]  that are making us fat,
[03:44:01.840 --> 03:44:03.840]  sick, and stupid.
[03:44:03.840 --> 03:44:05.840]  So what do we do about it? Well
[03:44:05.840 --> 03:44:07.840]  for starters, don't just sit there
[03:44:07.840 --> 03:44:09.840]  and take it. Fight back!

[03:45:21.840 --> 03:45:23.840]  can cause fatigue, depression,
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:25.840]  poor memory, and lethargy.

[03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:07.840]  is 1776.
[03:47:07.840 --> 03:47:09.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:13.840 --> 03:47:15.840]  With Roger Stone bringing us in live.

[03:47:23.840 --> 03:47:25.840]  And now breaking news from Las Vegas, Nevada,
[03:47:25.840 --> 03:47:27.840]  federal judge Gloria Navarro
[03:47:27.840 --> 03:47:29.840]  has declared a mistrial
[03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:31.840]  in the case of rancher
[03:47:31.840 --> 03:47:33.840]  Cliven Bundy.
[03:47:33.840 --> 03:47:35.840]  Her ruling for a mistrial
[03:47:35.840 --> 03:47:37.840]  is based on the fact that
[03:47:37.840 --> 03:47:39.840]  the federal prosecutors
[03:47:39.840 --> 03:47:41.840]  withheld evidence
[03:47:41.840 --> 03:47:43.840]  exculpatory
[03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:45.840]  of rancher Bundy and his
[03:47:45.840 --> 03:47:47.840]  supporters.
[03:47:47.840 --> 03:47:49.840]  The amazing thing about the federal government
[03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:51.840]  is even when they get caught
[03:47:51.840 --> 03:47:53.840]  cheating, they could get a do-over.
[03:47:53.840 --> 03:47:55.840]  Right now, technically
[03:47:55.840 --> 03:47:57.840]  Bundy's retrial was scheduled
[03:47:57.840 --> 03:47:59.840]  for February.
[03:47:59.840 --> 03:48:01.840]  No word yet on whether the government
[03:48:01.840 --> 03:48:03.840]  will try yet again
[03:48:03.840 --> 03:48:05.840]  to
[03:48:05.840 --> 03:48:07.840]  convict Bundy
[03:48:07.840 --> 03:48:09.840]  for standing up to the
[03:48:09.840 --> 03:48:11.840]  federal government.
[03:48:11.840 --> 03:48:13.840]  We here at Infowars
[03:48:13.840 --> 03:48:15.840]  came out for a pardon
[03:48:15.840 --> 03:48:17.840]  for Bundy, a presidential pardon months
[03:48:17.840 --> 03:48:19.840]  ago. We are hopeful that
[03:48:19.840 --> 03:48:21.840]  pardon will be unnecessary
[03:48:21.840 --> 03:48:23.840]  and the federal government
[03:48:23.840 --> 03:48:25.840]  will end its efforts
[03:48:25.840 --> 03:48:27.840]  to harass these
[03:48:27.840 --> 03:48:29.840]  values.
[03:48:29.840 --> 03:48:31.840]  But we did want to see Arpaio not tooting our horn, but they got really mad about that.
[03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:33.840]  Well, and
[03:48:33.840 --> 03:48:35.840]  I am hopeful this won't be necessary
[03:48:35.840 --> 03:48:37.840]  but this is big news
[03:48:37.840 --> 03:48:39.840]  and you are hearing it here
[03:48:39.840 --> 03:48:41.840]  at Infowars.
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:43.840]  Absolutely. We had
[03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:45.840]  Joe Scalzone. He said this was the word yesterday.
[03:48:45.840 --> 03:48:47.840]  So, tomorrow's news today.
[03:48:47.840 --> 03:48:49.840]  Scott in
[03:48:49.840 --> 03:48:51.840]  EMA, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[03:48:51.840 --> 03:48:53.840]  Hey, thanks.
[03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:55.840]  Alice, I had a quick question
[03:48:55.840 --> 03:48:57.840]  for all of you.
[03:48:57.840 --> 03:48:59.840]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:48:59.840 --> 03:49:01.840]  So, I take the supermail vitality
[03:49:01.840 --> 03:49:03.840]  and it's live change. You've got highly recommended
[03:49:03.840 --> 03:49:05.840]  for everyone. I have a question
[03:49:05.840 --> 03:49:07.840]  for Dr. Groot and then something I kind of wanted to
[03:49:07.840 --> 03:49:09.840]  Sure, go ahead. You're on the air.
[03:49:09.840 --> 03:49:11.840]  Okay. Dr. Groot, do you have
[03:49:11.840 --> 03:49:13.840]  anything to recommend to people that are these
[03:49:13.840 --> 03:49:15.840]  soy boys that, you know, they
[03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:17.840]  take soy and all that and they're heavily demasculated?
[03:49:17.840 --> 03:49:19.840]  Would you recommend the
[03:49:19.840 --> 03:49:21.840]  supermail or out power for them?
[03:49:21.840 --> 03:49:23.840]  Yeah, that's actually a great question, Scott.
[03:49:23.840 --> 03:49:25.840]  I would absolutely
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:27.840]  I would recommend it because soy is one of the things
[03:49:27.840 --> 03:49:29.840]  I recommend people get off of.
[03:49:29.840 --> 03:49:31.840]  It's in all the baby formulas out there.
[03:49:31.840 --> 03:49:33.840]  I've been trying to tell people to eliminate
[03:49:33.840 --> 03:49:35.840]  soy, not fermented soy, but all the
[03:49:35.840 --> 03:49:37.840]  soy. Number one is heavily contaminated.
[03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:39.840]  It's all genetically modified.
[03:49:39.840 --> 03:49:41.840]  Number two, it's heavily sprayed
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:43.840]  in full of pesticides. Would you do a whole show
[03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:45.840]  on that? But all the buzz for people all
[03:49:45.840 --> 03:49:47.840]  admit we did a study.
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:49.840]  They obsess on soy and guzzle it.
[03:49:49.840 --> 03:49:51.840]  Soy is one of the worst
[03:49:51.840 --> 03:49:53.840]  things you can put in your system.
[03:49:53.840 --> 03:49:55.840]  It wreaks havoc on the digestive system.
[03:49:55.840 --> 03:49:57.840]  It is
[03:49:57.840 --> 03:49:59.840]  the only baby formula approved
[03:49:59.840 --> 03:50:01.840]  under the US government
[03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:03.840]  welfare program.
[03:50:03.840 --> 03:50:05.840]  They will not approve any of the natural
[03:50:05.840 --> 03:50:07.840]  ones. It's also given
[03:50:07.840 --> 03:50:09.840]  to the
[03:50:09.840 --> 03:50:11.840]  a lot of people in hospitals, the pharmaceutical companies
[03:50:11.840 --> 03:50:13.840]  promoted in their
[03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:15.840]  food supplements like insurer and stuff like that.
[03:50:15.840 --> 03:50:17.840]  But soy is an
[03:50:17.840 --> 03:50:19.840]  estrogen mimicker and it
[03:50:19.840 --> 03:50:21.840]  increases the estrogen content
[03:50:21.840 --> 03:50:23.840]  in your body and that's why it's so
[03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:25.840]  damaging, not only for women
[03:50:25.840 --> 03:50:27.840]  because you increase estrogen
[03:50:27.840 --> 03:50:29.840]  in a male or a female and you're increasing
[03:50:29.840 --> 03:50:31.840]  your chances of cancer.
[03:50:31.840 --> 03:50:33.840]  You're increasing your chances of
[03:50:33.840 --> 03:50:35.840]  cystic. And Roundup, it does the same thing.
[03:50:35.840 --> 03:50:37.840]  It does. And so do
[03:50:37.840 --> 03:50:39.840]  phthalates in the endocrine disruptions.
[03:50:39.840 --> 03:50:41.840]  He asked why superman works so well. It's known
[03:50:41.840 --> 03:50:43.840]  herbs and compounds that boost
[03:50:43.840 --> 03:50:45.840]  libido energy. But it's cold pressed
[03:50:45.840 --> 03:50:47.840]  and they have this special aging process
[03:50:47.840 --> 03:50:49.840]  while we sell out of it a lot. You only explain to me
[03:50:49.840 --> 03:50:51.840]  that's why each batch is like a
[03:50:51.840 --> 03:50:53.840]  bottle of wine. It's different. It's not
[03:50:53.840 --> 03:50:55.840]  like a traditional herbal supplement out there.
[03:50:55.840 --> 03:50:57.840]  It's used to help balance out the male
[03:50:57.840 --> 03:50:59.840]  and enhance the production
[03:50:59.840 --> 03:51:01.840]  and balance of a male.
[03:51:01.840 --> 03:51:03.840]  By the way, it's 50% off for only
[03:51:03.840 --> 03:51:05.840]  two more days free shipping
[03:51:05.840 --> 03:51:07.840]  and for store.com
[03:51:07.840 --> 03:51:09.840]  and Mike is back in stock. I got to jump.
[03:51:09.840 --> 03:51:11.840]  Scott, I love you. We got to go to everybody here.
[03:51:11.840 --> 03:51:13.840]  Let's go ahead and
[03:51:13.840 --> 03:51:15.840]  talk to Kevin in Virginia.
[03:51:15.840 --> 03:51:17.840]  You can jump anytime you want. Roger Stone, go ahead.
[03:51:17.840 --> 03:51:19.840]  Kevin.
[03:51:19.840 --> 03:51:21.840]  Hi, Alex. Hey, I
[03:51:21.840 --> 03:51:23.840]  got a brain force testimony I want to tell you
[03:51:23.840 --> 03:51:25.840]  and I think this is touching.
[03:51:25.840 --> 03:51:27.840]  My girlfriend was hit by a car
[03:51:27.840 --> 03:51:29.840]  a few years ago and she died
[03:51:29.840 --> 03:51:31.840]  twice on the way to Hershey Medical Center.
[03:51:31.840 --> 03:51:33.840]  I mean, so there was some serious
[03:51:33.840 --> 03:51:35.840]  brain injury and she has a brachial
[03:51:35.840 --> 03:51:37.840]  plexus on her right side. She's kind
[03:51:37.840 --> 03:51:39.840]  of paralyzed on her right side. But besides
[03:51:39.840 --> 03:51:41.840]  that, I put her on brain force. I quit
[03:51:41.840 --> 03:51:43.840]  vaping, quit smoking and being
[03:51:45.840 --> 03:51:47.840]  what's the word I want. Anyway, besides
[03:51:47.840 --> 03:51:49.840]  that, I put her on brain force. Alex,
[03:51:49.840 --> 03:51:51.840]  her quality of life, you
[03:51:51.840 --> 03:51:53.840]  don't understand. She can
[03:51:53.840 --> 03:51:55.840]  remember names. She can remember
[03:51:55.840 --> 03:51:57.840]  a lot of stuff and her quality
[03:51:57.840 --> 03:51:59.840]  of life because of your product is
[03:51:59.840 --> 03:52:01.840]  one of the best that I've ever seen
[03:52:01.840 --> 03:52:03.840]  and I thank you from the bottom of my heart
[03:52:03.840 --> 03:52:05.840]  coming out with something
[03:52:05.840 --> 03:52:07.840]  like that because you have changed
[03:52:07.840 --> 03:52:09.840]  somebody's life for the better
[03:52:09.840 --> 03:52:11.840]  and it's one of the most
[03:52:11.840 --> 03:52:13.840]  powerful things that I've ever seen
[03:52:13.840 --> 03:52:15.840]  because of your brain force. She can remember
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:17.840]  things and it's just
[03:52:17.840 --> 03:52:19.840]  awesome. You don't know
[03:52:19.840 --> 03:52:21.840]  how great and how
[03:52:21.840 --> 03:52:23.840]  happy I am because of that and I
[03:52:23.840 --> 03:52:25.840]  thank you and I know you're a real
[03:52:25.840 --> 03:52:27.840]  person and a good person because of that.
[03:52:27.840 --> 03:52:29.840]  I know you have the Americans heart.
[03:52:29.840 --> 03:52:31.840]  Well, absolutely. Look, I believe
[03:52:31.840 --> 03:52:33.840]  everybody doing good than I do good, but
[03:52:33.840 --> 03:52:35.840]  we're going to set out to have a product to research
[03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:37.840]  whatever is already the best and discount it
[03:52:37.840 --> 03:52:39.840]  show you love in order again. I mean,
[03:52:39.840 --> 03:52:41.840]  it's self-serving as well. I take
[03:52:41.840 --> 03:52:43.840]  it. Roger Stone lives by
[03:52:43.840 --> 03:52:45.840]  don't you, Roger? Yeah, no, look, I
[03:52:45.840 --> 03:52:47.840]  have all the products on the infowars
[03:52:47.840 --> 03:52:49.840]  store. This is my absolute favorite.
[03:52:49.840 --> 03:52:51.840]  I find that I get this
[03:52:51.840 --> 03:52:53.840]  dip in energy both mental and physical
[03:52:53.840 --> 03:52:55.840]  energy around four in the afternoon. Me too.
[03:52:55.840 --> 03:52:57.840]  I pop two of these
[03:52:57.840 --> 03:52:59.840]  and I get mental clarity.
[03:52:59.840 --> 03:53:01.840]  I get mental energy. I get
[03:53:01.840 --> 03:53:03.840]  a slight lift in my physical energy
[03:53:03.840 --> 03:53:05.840]  and I'm able to work another seven
[03:53:05.840 --> 03:53:07.840]  eight hours. I like to write
[03:53:07.840 --> 03:53:09.840]  late at night when the phone's not ringing
[03:53:09.840 --> 03:53:11.840]  when you don't have as many incoming
[03:53:11.840 --> 03:53:13.840]  emails and texts and
[03:53:13.840 --> 03:53:15.840]  I really find brain force
[03:53:15.840 --> 03:53:17.840]  a plus just an extraordinarily
[03:53:17.840 --> 03:53:19.840]  effective yet
[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:21.840]  I can sleep. There's no hang.
[03:53:21.840 --> 03:53:23.840]  You're not ramped up. You're not amped up
[03:53:23.840 --> 03:53:25.840]  the way and fetamines do.
[03:53:25.840 --> 03:53:27.840]  I can't say enough about it and now I'm going
[03:53:27.840 --> 03:53:29.840]  on the auto ship Alex because
[03:53:29.840 --> 03:53:31.840]  one time I forgot to order
[03:53:31.840 --> 03:53:33.840]  and the store was out because
[03:53:33.840 --> 03:53:35.840]  this stuff flies off the shelves
[03:53:35.840 --> 03:53:37.840]  and we had some infowars shows where
[03:53:37.840 --> 03:53:39.840]  I wasn't as sharp as I could have been
[03:53:39.840 --> 03:53:41.840]  so that's never going to happen again.
[03:53:41.840 --> 03:53:43.840]  I'm on the auto ship function now
[03:53:43.840 --> 03:53:45.840]  because this is a product that just gets
[03:53:45.840 --> 03:53:47.840]  me through the work day. Well we're in a war
[03:53:47.840 --> 03:53:49.840]  and that's why we try to sell the best products. We appreciate
[03:53:49.840 --> 03:53:51.840]  folks and you know Dr. Group didn't design
[03:53:51.840 --> 03:53:53.840]  brain force but he's pointed out it's a
[03:53:53.840 --> 03:53:55.840]  really good product and I want
[03:53:55.840 --> 03:53:57.840]  to work with Dr. Group on a brain
[03:53:57.840 --> 03:53:59.840]  and a tropic. I know you don't like stimulants
[03:53:59.840 --> 03:54:01.840]  so a lot of natural stuff that does it and a few
[03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:03.840]  other things that are natural but are stimulants
[03:54:03.840 --> 03:54:05.840]  but imagine if you and I if you come up with
[03:54:05.840 --> 03:54:07.840]  a because you're saying hey we're too hyped
[03:54:07.840 --> 03:54:09.840]  but I mean we need to have Dr. Group
[03:54:09.840 --> 03:54:11.840]  come up with a brain force.
[03:54:11.840 --> 03:54:13.840]  Now I mean Kevin give yourself a lot of credit
[03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:15.840]  too because because of you
[03:54:15.840 --> 03:54:17.840]  and because of your knowledge
[03:54:17.840 --> 03:54:19.840]  I would say you're a big part of saving
[03:54:19.840 --> 03:54:21.840]  your girlfriends you know
[03:54:21.840 --> 03:54:23.840]  a mental acuity and that's another
[03:54:23.840 --> 03:54:25.840]  big thing that we don't talk about a lot is
[03:54:25.840 --> 03:54:27.840]  so many of the info warriors
[03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:29.840]  out there that help
[03:54:29.840 --> 03:54:31.840]  so many of their family and friends
[03:54:31.840 --> 03:54:33.840]  and all the people that they know
[03:54:33.840 --> 03:54:35.840]  and they spread the message and that
[03:54:35.840 --> 03:54:37.840]  you know once you're healthy
[03:54:37.840 --> 03:54:39.840]  your brain is
[03:54:39.840 --> 03:54:41.840]  working efficiently you're detoxifying
[03:54:41.840 --> 03:54:43.840]  all that fluoride and that's healthy
[03:54:43.840 --> 03:54:45.840]  it's a chain reaction I mean so
[03:54:45.840 --> 03:54:47.840]  Kevin we love you and thank you
[03:54:47.840 --> 03:54:49.840]  and we're all in it together brother

[03:55:07.840 --> 03:55:09.840]  I got a question for Dr. Group and I got an important question
[03:55:09.840 --> 03:55:11.840]  about the album brother
[03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:13.840]  so my
[03:55:13.840 --> 03:55:15.840]  very close family member of mine also an info warrior
[03:55:15.840 --> 03:55:17.840]  he's
[03:55:17.840 --> 03:55:19.840]  on his last legs when it comes to his battle of cancer
[03:55:19.840 --> 03:55:21.840]  and I know you've talked in the past about certain
[03:55:21.840 --> 03:55:23.840]  you know different types of
[03:55:23.840 --> 03:55:25.840]  alternative medicines or alternative treatments
[03:55:25.840 --> 03:55:27.840]  like the vitamin C
[03:55:27.840 --> 03:55:29.840]  glucose stuff or maybe oregano oil or juicing
[03:55:29.840 --> 03:55:31.840]  is there any specific clinic
[03:55:31.840 --> 03:55:33.840]  specific thing you prefer Dr. Group
[03:55:33.840 --> 03:55:35.840]  when it comes to treating cancer
[03:55:35.840 --> 03:55:37.840]  and specifically of the liver
[03:55:37.840 --> 03:55:39.840]  yes there's actually a clinic
[03:55:39.840 --> 03:55:41.840]  and I know the guy very well is Dr. Yimenez
[03:55:41.840 --> 03:55:43.840]  and it's hope the number 4
[03:55:43.840 --> 03:55:45.840]  cancer.com
[03:55:45.840 --> 03:55:47.840]  he just opened a new clinic down in Cancun
[03:55:47.840 --> 03:55:49.840]  it's hope 4 cancer with the number 4
[03:55:49.840 --> 03:55:51.840]  I can't
[03:55:51.840 --> 03:55:53.840]  even say what he's using on the air
[03:55:53.840 --> 03:55:55.840]  right now but let me just
[03:55:55.840 --> 03:55:57.840]  say this what he the protocols
[03:55:57.840 --> 03:55:59.840]  that he has are
[03:55:59.840 --> 03:56:01.840]  by far
[03:56:01.840 --> 03:56:03.840]  I mean there's also stem cell clinics
[03:56:03.840 --> 03:56:05.840]  but what he's using down there
[03:56:05.840 --> 03:56:07.840]  and what he's doing
[03:56:07.840 --> 03:56:09.840]  and the results he's getting are
[03:56:09.840 --> 03:56:11.840]  some of the best in the world
[03:56:11.840 --> 03:56:13.840]  I just spoke at the truth about cancer
[03:56:13.840 --> 03:56:15.840]  symposium I know
[03:56:15.840 --> 03:56:17.840]  all those guys I was just in Tennessee a couple weeks ago
[03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:19.840]  with some of the top
[03:56:19.840 --> 03:56:21.840]  natural cancer
[03:56:21.840 --> 03:56:23.840]  experts and doctors in the world
[03:56:23.840 --> 03:56:25.840]  and many of them are doing good things
[03:56:25.840 --> 03:56:27.840]  don't get me wrong but that
[03:56:27.840 --> 03:56:29.840]  would be my recommendation because
[03:56:29.840 --> 03:56:31.840]  I apologize we're out of time Roger Stone's got to go
[03:56:31.840 --> 03:56:33.840]  catch a plane
