[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.880]  waging war on corruption crashing the lies and disinformation i'm your host alex
[00:38.880 --> 00:47.160]  jones we're live it's sunday october 8th 2017 we're gonna be live here for the
[00:47.160 --> 00:54.560]  next two hours as we are every sunday from 4 to 6 p.m. well last sunday i said
[00:54.560 --> 00:59.640]  mass shootings were eminent in america and it would be used to go after the
[00:59.640 --> 01:04.960]  second amendment in american freedoms and now we've seen the attack take place
[01:04.960 --> 01:10.440]  and the picture is incredibly clear we have multiple gunmen the acoustics are
[01:10.440 --> 01:15.160]  100% clear the witnesses a half mile away at other hotels saw people being
[01:15.160 --> 01:20.160]  shot saw glass saw shell casings saw police taking out whoever it was
[01:20.160 --> 01:24.840]  shooting and you can hear in the first few minutes that there's multiple firearms
[01:24.840 --> 01:29.480]  going off from different distances there's cab driver footage that we're
[01:29.480 --> 01:35.080]  gonna play now why is this so important because it tells us the official story is
[01:35.080 --> 01:41.600]  not true now mainstream media makes all these jokes and that's why they don't
[01:41.600 --> 01:47.080]  have any viewers or listeners and they say oh jones claims he talks to navy
[01:47.080 --> 01:52.000]  seals he claims he talks to delta force people he claims he talks to green
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.520]  berets now he claims he talked to the hostage rescue team i don't claim
[01:56.520 --> 02:03.520]  anything i have laid out the facts and our history of having whistleblower top
[02:03.520 --> 02:08.520]  notch top shelf information is sterling but isn't about how we're right or how
[02:08.520 --> 02:16.800]  we're wrong it's about the issue and joining us craig soyer doesn't let me
[02:16.800 --> 02:21.120]  talk about what he did the navy seals he was a leader in silting six not the
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.640]  commander of the whole silting six he's got shows on history channel discovery
[02:24.640 --> 02:28.080]  channel he's very very highly respected is one of the top marksmen in the world
[02:28.080 --> 02:35.840]  and he says clearly there's overlapping fire it's not echoes but we've got
[02:35.840 --> 02:41.080]  video where the cab driver here's bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup off the
[02:41.080 --> 02:45.440]  distance and he goes on then 30 seconds later bam bam bam right above her
[02:45.440 --> 02:50.160]  because she's at man delay and there's all these other countless videos i watched
[02:50.160 --> 02:54.640]  just yesterday probably 30 minutes of different people's cell phone footage all
[02:54.640 --> 03:00.600]  over vegas downtown vegas i mean it is at one point you hear but i mean it's
[03:00.600 --> 03:07.720]  just like three guns going so i hadn't heard that yet so it is just crazy and
[03:07.720 --> 03:12.120]  meeting was old jones claims he has these people when i've had some of them on
[03:12.120 --> 03:20.120]  the broadcast so craig's joining us in 30 minutes because this is so central and
[03:20.120 --> 03:23.000]  so important because some can say well it's a diversion from the overall story
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.440]  of his middle eastern connections i understand that it's not the central
[03:26.440 --> 03:29.760]  issue but if you can prove this wrong you can prove it all wrong and i
[03:29.760 --> 03:31.920]  understand they're not trying to create a panic here so that's why they're
[03:31.920 --> 03:35.040]  telling people this back in the 70s and stuff you had a lot of terror attacks
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.760]  they wouldn't even hardly report them on the news that's a tactic if you're not
[03:39.760 --> 03:44.360]  trying to use terror to freak people out and take their rights since the 90s and
[03:44.360 --> 03:47.720]  through that we're they sort of leasing terror to take our rights some of its
[03:47.720 --> 03:51.440]  synthetics were manufactured some of the false flags a lot of it real they
[03:51.440 --> 03:56.560]  started hyping it up but when the old policy was you don't talk about it you
[03:56.560 --> 04:00.320]  don't make a big deal about it and you don't give who did it credit because
[04:00.320 --> 04:04.680]  that's what they want is credit and ices a bunch of them hundreds of them just
[04:04.680 --> 04:08.520]  gave up today thousands in the last week they're only a few cities left the
[04:08.520 --> 04:11.840]  Middle East i mean they have been crushed by our military and trump cleaning
[04:11.840 --> 04:16.000]  up obama's mess so i get you don't want to give them this big victory and just
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.640]  say well it's we don't know who did it but that's that's that's not the truth
[04:23.640 --> 04:28.840]  and we're not running wartime propaganda here in america and so i was
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.320]  contacted by the horses rescue team let's give us really good info before and
[04:33.320 --> 04:37.120]  they said listen there's this lomax stuff in here trips the Middle East and
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.200]  there's a bunch of anti-facura and they're lying about it please get this
[04:41.200 --> 04:44.880]  out it's come out today he traveled the Middle East not just his girlfriend and
[04:44.880 --> 04:48.520]  reportedly had a bunch of paraphernalia i mean we told you they're looking at
[04:48.520 --> 04:51.320]  other people the sheriff's department said that now and we told you they were
[04:51.320 --> 04:54.320]  looking at radicalization which was confirmed everything we said has been
[04:54.320 --> 04:59.000]  confirmed get the rest of the story straight ahead
[05:00.240 --> 05:06.040]  joe biggs here with info wars com with some patriotic quotes by ron paul the
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.400]  most basic principle to being a free american is the notion that we as
[05:10.400 --> 05:15.600]  individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions we do not have the
[05:15.600 --> 05:19.760]  right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes neither does our
[05:19.760 --> 05:24.440]  neighbor have any right to tell us how to live so long as we aren't infringing
[05:24.440 --> 05:28.920]  on their rights freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to
[05:28.920 --> 05:32.800]  make good ones if we are only free to make good decisions then we are not
[05:32.800 --> 05:37.760]  really free liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset
[05:37.760 --> 05:42.160]  when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints random searches
[05:42.160 --> 05:47.440]  mandatory identification cards and paramilitary police in our streets we
[05:47.440 --> 05:52.640]  have lost a vital part of our american heritage america was born of protests
[05:52.640 --> 05:57.360]  revolution and mistrust of government subservient societies neither maintain
[05:57.360 --> 06:00.960]  nor deserve freedom for long
[06:00.960 --> 06:09.600]  i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of
[06:09.600 --> 06:16.960]  tyranny over the mind of man thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcn
[06:16.960 --> 06:20.320]  radio network
[06:20.320 --> 06:31.120]  i'm gonna be honest with you i disagree with what president trump is doing
[06:31.120 --> 06:36.240]  concerning the vegas massacre we know it's al-qaeda ices we know that they're
[06:36.240 --> 06:40.480]  covering it up because they don't want to give ices a victory right as thousands
[06:40.480 --> 06:45.760]  of ices fighters this week hundreds today have surrendered in syria and iraq and
[06:45.760 --> 06:50.080]  the last few little pockets of them are now being defeated as president trump
[06:50.080 --> 06:54.480]  in the u.s. military clean up obama nato and the globalist mess when they
[06:54.480 --> 06:59.280]  finance that group so i get why they don't want to give them their victory
[06:59.280 --> 07:04.000]  when you're countering propaganda you don't give it any attention
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.080]  but we cannot sit here and have the second amendment blamed and we cannot
[07:08.080 --> 07:12.560]  sit here and have them cover up what went on or we become what we were fighting
[07:12.560 --> 07:15.200]  so i do not
[07:15.200 --> 07:19.920]  agree with what's going on and we have craig soyer former team leader in still
[07:19.920 --> 07:24.400]  team six talk show host ballistics expert history channel discovery channel
[07:24.400 --> 07:28.400]  very well respected he has tv shows as a ballistics expert
[07:28.400 --> 07:35.120]  on national television and he said on tuesday and on friday this is clearly
[07:35.120 --> 07:40.000]  multiple firearms being shot he'll be joining us at the bottom of the hour
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.200]  let me get into all the other news but the reason that's important is
[07:43.200 --> 07:46.400]  that part falls apart the whole narrative falls apart let me just give you
[07:46.400 --> 07:50.720]  the stacks of news here i have i've got one two three four five six seven eight
[07:50.720 --> 07:54.240]  nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen stacks some of these stacks are
[07:54.240 --> 07:57.600]  like 20 stories tall but but let me just give you my
[07:57.600 --> 08:01.360]  frustration because there's just so much here
[08:01.360 --> 08:04.880]  north korea ready to test a new missile capable of hitting
[08:04.880 --> 08:08.080]  us west coast
[08:08.080 --> 08:14.640]  isn't that interesting trump says north korea diplomacy has failed
[08:14.640 --> 08:17.840]  only one thing will work military action
[08:17.840 --> 08:21.680]  that's the calm before the storm he was talking about next week
[08:21.680 --> 08:26.560]  we've also got iran warns us against imposing further sanctions threatens
[08:26.560 --> 08:32.240]  war report trump poised up into obama's most important climate
[08:32.240 --> 08:37.360]  regulation that put a tax on us carbon dioxide as a toxic waste
[08:37.360 --> 08:40.960]  saying u.s companies could not produce it
[08:40.960 --> 08:44.320]  even though it's not recognized as a waste or a toxin anywhere else in the
[08:44.320 --> 08:47.280]  world it's designed to sabotage our economy
[08:47.280 --> 08:50.400]  and this is trump just delivering on what he said he would do the economy
[08:50.400 --> 08:54.480]  asserts a 3.1 growth it's set to be at 3.9 by the end of the
[08:54.480 --> 08:58.160]  year that's why the federal reserve is set to raise interest rates to stop the
[08:58.160 --> 09:01.600]  growth that is a civil war in our country vp
[09:01.600 --> 09:05.120]  mike pence leaves cults game because 49ers players
[09:05.120 --> 09:08.240]  knelt during the anthem when they said they wouldn't
[09:08.240 --> 09:11.760]  and of course i just think this is great because pence has his first amendment
[09:11.760 --> 09:16.720]  show to you and now we've got the very exciting news
[09:16.720 --> 09:20.640]  that the nfl has lost 31 percent of its core
[09:20.640 --> 09:25.600]  viewers just this year and they lost another 20 plus percent in the last
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.360]  couple years so they're down 50 plus percent that's beautiful
[09:29.360 --> 09:33.280]  they're now the most unpopular when people are asked about it
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.360]  most unpopular sport in america because you're not america's team
[09:37.360 --> 09:39.840]  you're not america's sport you're a globalist
[09:39.840 --> 09:44.640]  hollywood filth production spewing anti-gun anti-family trash and you're
[09:44.640 --> 09:47.280]  another bellwether of the death of the establishment
[09:47.280 --> 09:52.000]  it is creme de la creme coup de gras it is the best it is delicious it is the
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.520]  final blow it just doesn't get better than that
[09:55.520 --> 09:58.880]  does it trump port claims columbus day without
[09:58.880 --> 10:03.440]  obama's qualms while antifa promises violent demonstrations tomorrow they're
[10:03.440 --> 10:06.800]  watching like oh it's so racist the native americans were killing each
[10:06.800 --> 10:10.400]  other 24-7 and we're cutting people's hearts out and
[10:10.400 --> 10:13.600]  eating them uh i mean karanka laws in texas were
[10:13.600 --> 10:17.360]  eating people not just the astex and by the way folks i'm part native american
[10:17.360 --> 10:20.880]  i'm not putting native americans down it's just they were just as barbarous as
[10:20.880 --> 10:23.120]  anybody you'd ever imagine and the shooters
[10:23.120 --> 10:25.760]  settlers showed up they'd say you're gonna help us take over the next trap we're
[10:25.760 --> 10:29.200]  gonna kill you they were constantly killing each other
[10:29.200 --> 10:34.160]  and just to lionize them up through these angels and oh the evil of the west
[10:34.160 --> 10:37.200]  showing up that's just a way to make you hate yourself
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.880]  it's just a load of bull for people that actually haven't studied history
[10:40.880 --> 10:46.800]  so i think that's good there's a big report uh coming out here with the
[10:46.800 --> 10:50.320]  catalonia and how spain is attempting basically marshal law to keep that
[10:50.320 --> 10:53.360]  breakaway district under control but it's not going to work because the more
[10:53.360 --> 11:00.720]  they squeeze the more people will resist but here's the really big news for you
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.120]  progress knowingly exposing others to hiv
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.440]  no longer a felony it is the same as a parking ticket the lowest
[11:09.440 --> 11:14.560]  level misdemeanor so you knowingly give somebody a virus that can cause an
[11:14.560 --> 11:18.880]  autoimmune disease that makes you slowly die over five to ten years
[11:18.880 --> 11:25.840]  but that's okay governor jerry brown signed it and talked about equality well
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.960]  it's not evil to have a disease be it leprosy hiv
[11:30.960 --> 11:36.560]  hepatitis whatever but it's certainly evil to give it to someone
[11:36.560 --> 11:40.240]  but they're saying no that's okay and i want to get into the psychology
[11:40.240 --> 11:44.080]  of the insane democratic party here because when hiv goes from lower numbers
[11:44.080 --> 11:47.360]  like it is it could explode in the next five years
[11:47.360 --> 11:51.680]  in a few years if we're still here as a planet don't have nuclear war i will
[11:51.680 --> 11:57.280]  go back to this show and say here i am in 2017 saying within three to five years
[11:57.280 --> 12:03.040]  california will have a 200 increase in hiv
[12:03.040 --> 12:07.840]  and they will also complain and say we need single-payer
[12:07.840 --> 12:11.200]  we need social self-care the reason we have hiv is because we don't have free
[12:11.200 --> 12:15.520]  health care no the reason you have hiv is because it is a culture now in the
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.120]  gay community that i first read about 20 years ago in rolling stone
[12:19.120 --> 12:25.520]  to give other people hiv it's truly nihilistic so here's the article
[12:25.520 --> 12:31.360]  progress la times knowingly exposing others hiv no longer a felony in
[12:31.360 --> 12:35.360]  california it's the same thing
[12:37.200 --> 12:40.960]  as a parking ticket so it's essentially legalized
[12:40.960 --> 12:44.400]  and here's the la times governor jerry brown signed a bill fronty that lowers
[12:44.400 --> 12:47.280]  from a felony to a missionary to the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual
[12:47.280 --> 12:51.120]  partner to hiv without disclosing the infection how about hepatitis how about
[12:51.120 --> 12:54.160]  everything else the measure also applies to those who give blood without
[12:54.160 --> 12:57.440]  telling blood bank they're hiv positive oh wow
[12:57.440 --> 13:00.960]  don't tell the blood bank you're hiv positive
[13:00.960 --> 13:04.720]  this is a religion this is satanism folks because if they can get away with
[13:04.720 --> 13:06.800]  this thing or with anything this is totally insane
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.160]  remember the clinton's row for a decade knew that all the blood coming out of
[13:10.160 --> 13:13.920]  their prisons was infected with hiv and hepatitis all of it because they would
[13:13.920 --> 13:16.720]  mix it together and they would sell it into canada
[13:16.720 --> 13:20.560]  and say it was all clean and then bear would buy it turn into factor eight
[13:20.560 --> 13:24.720]  and bear knew it all had hiv in it and they still shipped it out as population
[13:24.720 --> 13:29.280]  reduction it's in the documents so this takes
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.280]  bug chasing to a whole new level this isn't two guys getting together at you
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.520]  don't want a bar bathroom or wherever okay this is
[13:37.520 --> 13:41.440]  this is children hemophiliacs getting it and
[13:41.440 --> 13:46.560]  there's a religion this is mainstream news of giving people hiv and then aids
[13:46.560 --> 13:49.360]  of killing them and that of wanting to get killed
[13:49.360 --> 13:53.120]  but see that's not enough of a thrill it's more of a sacrament
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.240]  for jerry brown to destroy the entire blood industry to destroy even further
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.080]  and then let the entire us blood supply be tainted again
[14:02.080 --> 14:04.880]  but it's okay it's like it's okay to teach five-year-olds you know that
[14:04.880 --> 14:07.280]  they're not really a man or not really a woman that they're really something
[14:07.280 --> 14:10.320]  else in school pedophilia being normalized by
[14:10.320 --> 14:13.600]  mainstream news by the new york times uh by salon
[14:13.600 --> 14:18.080]  it's all about how far can they push you what can they get away with
[14:18.080 --> 14:20.640]  so i'm gonna read this again from the all eight times governor jerry brown signed
[14:20.640 --> 14:24.160]  a bill friday that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor the crime of knowingly
[14:24.160 --> 14:27.600]  exposing a sexual partner to hiv without disclosing the infection
[14:27.600 --> 14:30.720]  the measure also applies to those who give blood without telling the blood bank
[14:30.720 --> 14:34.320]  they're hiv positive so you can go in give them the blood
[14:34.320 --> 14:38.080]  it infects the entire system and you kill a bunch of people
[14:38.080 --> 14:41.520]  but it's liberal so it's like well it's liberal
[14:41.520 --> 14:47.040]  see oh my gosh no it's a satanic ritual and that's what bug chasers say
[14:47.040 --> 14:50.960]  they say how wonderful is when they first get the aids and you know first
[14:50.960 --> 14:55.120]  have the fever and then then now they're gods they call it being a god like
[14:55.120 --> 14:58.640]  meryl streep which is not promoting pedophilia uh you know standing ovations
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.560]  for roman polanski says that says that wine steens a god
[15:02.560 --> 15:05.760]  you understand and let me just give you a few of the articles to back this up
[15:05.760 --> 15:09.120]  briefly
[15:09.120 --> 15:12.720]  and cn reports like it's a good deal california hepatitis and outbreak on

[21:02.080 --> 21:05.680]  because we don't want to be politically incorrect and have a stigma
[21:05.680 --> 21:10.640]  i'm not kidding and so they're also saying you can intentionally
[21:10.640 --> 21:16.000]  give it to someone without telling them and that it's the equivalent of a
[21:16.000 --> 21:21.280]  parking ticket a 50 dollar fine no i'm not kidding that's
[21:21.280 --> 21:26.080]  in the la times ladies and gentlemen they are they are very very proud of this
[21:26.080 --> 21:31.680]  now this was first called bug chasing back in the 90s rolling stone the
[21:31.680 --> 21:36.240]  san francisco chronicle reported on bug chasers gay men and the intentional
[21:36.240 --> 21:40.560]  pursuit of hiv a narrative analysis now if you want to commit suicide

[21:45.120 --> 21:50.880]  takes a decade to kill you that's your issue but if you want to then make
[21:50.880 --> 21:56.240]  everyone else accept it because misery loves company
[21:56.240 --> 22:02.800]  that is pure evil ladies and gentlemen and it shows the mindset of hollywood
[22:02.800 --> 22:05.280]  and the people that are involved in this
[22:05.280 --> 22:10.800]  is that they want to infect society with their culture of death
[22:10.800 --> 22:15.280]  they want to sexualize your children whether he had a sexual homosexual
[22:15.280 --> 22:19.040]  it's all pedophilia with salon and the new york times promoting it
[22:19.040 --> 22:24.080]  i mean weinstein uh you know harassing all these women is wrong and is bad but
[22:24.080 --> 22:30.960]  it's it's the tip of the proverbial iceberg and if you understand all this
[22:30.960 --> 22:34.960]  you understand the mindset of what they want to do
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.240]  to fly over country california has set incredible precedents
[22:40.240 --> 22:43.680]  saying that they'll give your kids vaccines even if you don't want to
[22:43.680 --> 22:46.880]  and if you try to homestool your kid they'll take them away from you
[22:46.880 --> 22:53.840]  i mean it is a true authoritarian utopia and you're seeing the mindset
[22:53.840 --> 23:00.400]  the world view of the authoritarians and what they want to do to you so let
[23:00.400 --> 23:06.560]  that sink in they want to see how far they can go as
[23:06.560 --> 23:09.840]  deviance let me tell you it doesn't get more deviant
[23:09.840 --> 23:13.440]  than wanting to knowingly give blood when you've got
[23:13.440 --> 23:17.280]  hiv so other people get it i mean that is pure evil but see
[23:17.280 --> 23:21.360]  now being liberal means oh you can't have a mother and father on your
[23:21.360 --> 23:25.280]  elementary school entrance form that someone may not have that and see if
[23:25.280 --> 23:29.440]  you don't have hiv if you're not dying if you don't know what it's like
[23:29.440 --> 23:33.040]  well you're gonna find out and now the precedent will be well
[23:33.040 --> 23:36.720]  if i have hepatitis can i give it to you oh if i have leprosy can i give it to
[23:36.720 --> 23:39.440]  you and now you understand why these folks want to
[23:39.440 --> 23:43.840]  run your life they are evil this is what they're into
[23:43.840 --> 23:48.640]  this is what they do and the good news is they know they're dying
[23:48.640 --> 23:52.000]  the globalist their system they know it's falling apart
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  and they're not content enough to sexualize the children they're not
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.960]  enough you're intent enough to bully the gay community
[23:58.960 --> 24:01.920]  this through their liberal propaganda they've got control of and they're
[24:01.920 --> 24:05.680]  strangling and murdering and killing and trying to suck the life out of
[24:05.680 --> 24:08.960]  they want every community so the media will spend this up
[24:08.960 --> 24:11.840]  hanging gay people that's not what i'm doing that's the mental illness here
[24:11.840 --> 24:16.960]  oh let us sexualize your kids or you don't like transsexuals
[24:16.960 --> 24:21.280]  they use all these groups as a foil as a shield to get
[24:21.280 --> 24:24.720]  political control and it's pure abject evil
[24:24.720 --> 24:28.640]  again i'm gonna say this again for everybody that just tuned in
[24:28.640 --> 24:34.880]  california governor jerry brown signed a bill that the la times with a straight
[24:34.880 --> 24:38.880]  face reports is loving and liberal and that lets you knowingly
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.880]  infect people with hiv and lets you knowingly go give
[24:42.880 --> 24:47.760]  blood when you know you have it that's like driving down the road randomly
[24:47.760 --> 24:52.160]  pass some station wagon or minivan and randomly shooting bullets into it not
[24:52.160 --> 24:55.600]  knowing if one will hit or not i mean that is the exact same thing if you've
[24:55.600 --> 24:59.520]  got a virus you know kills people and you're going to go give blood and not
[24:59.520 --> 25:01.840]  tell them
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.400]  good god this is just total cultural sabotage and it's what all the nfl
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.280]  kneelings about and it's the globalists realizing their systems coming
[25:13.280 --> 25:16.320]  down so they want to dynamite the entire civilization
[25:16.320 --> 25:21.040]  they want to bring it down and remember the clintons
[25:21.040 --> 25:24.400]  had that history look up the clinton blood scandal where they were the one
[25:24.400 --> 25:27.440]  state that wouldn't test the prisoners and would
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.280]  certify they've been tested and would ship out the blood
[25:31.280 --> 25:35.520]  and would knowingly contaminate it and over a hundred thousand hemophiliacs
[25:35.520 --> 25:42.400]  died from getting HIV and hepatitis good lord
[25:42.400 --> 25:48.720]  the ab the abject total and complete evil i had the doctor on who was working

[33:26.640 --> 33:30.080]  it's alex jones
[33:32.640 --> 33:37.760]  well craig solman shoyer has hosted what is at least five different shows on
[33:37.760 --> 33:43.840]  national television he's the main expert shooter on top shots
[33:43.840 --> 33:47.760]  and he's one of the top advisors to hollywood films so he's a top ballistics
[33:47.760 --> 33:50.640]  guy and you know he's risking a lot the last few
[33:50.640 --> 33:54.880]  years getting really political for the republic uh and coming out and
[33:54.880 --> 33:59.360]  speaking out against hollywood the globalist the whole new world order
[33:59.360 --> 34:02.880]  and the reason i wanted to get him back on today is they've had the washington
[34:02.880 --> 34:06.400]  post the new york times and literally hundreds of other
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.680]  publications come out and say jones says he has all
[34:11.680 --> 34:14.880]  these military sources that say they clearly hear multiple
[34:14.880 --> 34:19.360]  shots he's making it up even though i've had kreg on as an
[34:19.360 --> 34:22.400]  expert and i've had other military people on and i've
[34:22.400 --> 34:27.120]  also talked to people that are in delta force green beret army
[34:27.120 --> 34:32.160]  other navy seals you name it some of them have been on the show before
[34:32.160 --> 34:34.880]  but some of them are involved in this investigation so they can't come on now
[34:34.880 --> 34:37.840]  kreg isn't he's also a federal officer air
[34:37.840 --> 34:41.360]  marshal and i'm not going to go over his whole bio
[34:41.360 --> 34:45.520]  and i don't normally uh go over the whole bio but the media
[34:45.520 --> 34:50.160]  plays these games they go jones claims he has sources inside the hostage rescue
[34:50.160 --> 34:53.040]  team uh that say they found islamic and
[34:53.040 --> 34:57.200]  antiva paraphernalia no they called me and texted me monday
[34:57.200 --> 35:02.080]  uh the same folks told our reporters you better get out of
[35:02.080 --> 35:04.800]  oregon that's about the shooting is about to start and two days later it
[35:04.800 --> 35:07.520]  happened our people got out i mean these are really
[35:07.520 --> 35:10.960]  good people who are on the ground and sources
[35:10.960 --> 35:14.160]  and but kreg's willing to come on and talk about it
[35:14.160 --> 35:17.360]  former team leader in shield team sex must be clear to didn't command this whole
[35:17.360 --> 35:20.080]  team sex and you don't even want to say that but the point is we have to say
[35:20.080 --> 35:23.360]  some of the bona fides some of the curriculum
[35:23.360 --> 35:25.840]  vitae so people know who we're talking to
[35:25.840 --> 35:29.200]  this is the guy with the big discovery channel show and the history channel
[35:29.200 --> 35:32.080]  shows you know top shots you know he's a top
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.440]  ballistics expert he's saying here's two different groups shooting
[35:35.440 --> 35:40.320]  but after he said that on tuesday we have footage of cab drivers
[35:40.320 --> 35:44.160]  where you're bup bup bup bup bup bup bup it's caught on echo 45 seconds later
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.480]  bam bam bam bam at man delay above him that's what people report down the road
[35:48.480 --> 35:51.520]  of shell casings and guys shot by the police so
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.600]  the police are being told not to say what happened i guess not to create panic
[35:55.600 --> 35:59.040]  and they don't want to give ices a victory and i i get that's the old policy
[35:59.040 --> 36:03.120]  until the nineties is don't talk about terrorism you can't let them do this then
[36:03.120 --> 36:06.640]  and use it against the second amendment plus i'm not under martial law so i
[36:06.640 --> 36:09.760]  want the truth to come out now kreg's got sources he won't even get into him
[36:09.760 --> 36:12.720]  with me but he said yeah you're in the right direction but i have my other
[36:12.720 --> 36:15.520]  sources and they're like dead on this guy was ices
[36:15.520 --> 36:18.560]  he was getting money for his gambling millions a year
[36:18.560 --> 36:21.520]  they were trying to recruit westerners they said two years ago he pledged
[36:21.520 --> 36:24.560]  allegiance six months ago the white house has the video
[36:24.560 --> 36:27.920]  we have that from white house sources and i gotta say
[36:27.920 --> 36:31.120]  i i love the president i like the president and he's
[36:31.120 --> 36:35.680]  but i think this is wrong but but regardless there are multiple shooters
[36:35.680 --> 36:38.160]  why is that important we're gonna go over some of the acoustic evidence in a
[36:38.160 --> 36:41.040]  minute because it shows the whole story is not true
[36:41.040 --> 36:44.320]  saw man what do you think about the situation now in hindsight as we get
[36:44.320 --> 36:47.440]  more distance on this and as more comes out
[36:47.440 --> 36:52.960]  well alex i always look at the big picture when i when everyone gets
[36:52.960 --> 36:57.360]  confused and starts agonizing over the small details i take a couple steps
[36:57.360 --> 37:00.800]  back and scan the horizon if you will and consider
[37:00.800 --> 37:04.320]  what the big picture may be who benefits from
[37:04.320 --> 37:08.480]  these mass shootings why do they keep happening why are they always liberal
[37:08.480 --> 37:12.720]  democrats that do the shooting why are they always on psychotropic drugs
[37:12.720 --> 37:17.360]  and why are those facts always ignored by the
[37:17.360 --> 37:21.440]  the radicals on the left and the mainstream news media why is it always
[37:21.440 --> 37:25.600]  just about the uh the gun control narrative immediately
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.360]  and and ferociously so i scratch my head i'm like okay
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.240]  somebody benefits from this and it certainly wasn't the shooter in this
[37:32.240 --> 37:35.760]  case we can see uh if he was even in fact the
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.080]  shooter at all either they smoked him you know after he shot everybody up or
[37:40.080 --> 37:43.680]  he didn't even get to do that uh before they smoked him so
[37:43.680 --> 37:46.480]  this case thinks the height heavens a lot of
[37:46.480 --> 37:49.600]  things that don't match up with what the public's being told i think
[37:49.600 --> 37:53.200]  one of the main things is is those security cam
[37:53.200 --> 37:56.960]  the footage from the security cameras around mandalay bay they're everywhere
[37:56.960 --> 37:59.440]  you're not going to go anywhere in that hotel without
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.400]  being captured so i understand as a federal criminal investigator protecting
[38:04.400 --> 38:09.280]  the case and and safeguarding that that forensic
[38:09.280 --> 38:14.080]  evidence for the prosecutions that that may and hopefully are coming
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.960]  but at some point those those pieces of footage will be released
[38:18.960 --> 38:22.240]  to the public unless there's a big government cover-up
[38:22.240 --> 38:27.040]  if there's a big government cover-up those uh pieces of footage will go away
[38:27.040 --> 38:30.320]  nobody will ever see or hear from them bye bye
[38:30.320 --> 38:33.280]  and that's one of the things that's going to take time for me is just sitting
[38:33.280 --> 38:36.960]  watching and go okay are we ever going to get footage of that guy and
[38:36.960 --> 38:40.640]  anyone else going in and out of that that hotel room or is it going to be
[38:40.640 --> 38:42.800]  buried forever is it already even destroyed
[38:42.800 --> 38:46.400]  well sure i mean i got the call from the hrt and then the text
[38:46.400 --> 38:50.080]  uh to say go ahead and talk about it now that's real
[38:50.080 --> 38:53.280]  and we've proven all our sources but i know you've got a lot of sources you're
[38:53.280 --> 38:56.320]  very frustrated you're actually sitting here you've talked to some of the
[38:56.320 --> 38:58.800]  investigators we can't get into that and you
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.000]  know a lot more than you can say and is it frustrating to just have to sit here
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.360]  and watch the mainstream narrative
[39:05.360 --> 39:09.680]  well it is again we want to safeguard the investigation but we don't want the
[39:09.680 --> 39:15.040]  american people disarmed to the delight of our enemies to the glee of our
[39:15.040 --> 39:18.480]  globalist enemies who who are after that is one of their
[39:18.480 --> 39:21.600]  main objectives they need primarily two things
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.480]  they notice divided and they need us disarmed for them to have the level of
[39:26.480 --> 39:32.240]  tyrannical control that they're after if you shame on any american citizen by
[39:32.240 --> 39:36.880]  now that's not still is not educated on cloward
[39:36.880 --> 39:41.680]  piven and how that strategy is utilized to break our economy when we were
[39:41.680 --> 39:45.120]  suffering hundred and then the last eight years it's one of the things that's got
[39:45.120 --> 39:49.360]  them so upset about trump our economy our economy is recovering
[39:49.360 --> 39:52.720]  and he's going to ensure that we stop squandering and it is and now they're
[39:52.720 --> 39:55.120]  going to raise interest rates admittedly trying to kill it
[39:55.120 --> 39:57.840]  they said we can never get to three percentage three point one
[39:57.840 --> 40:00.240]  we're going to go to break and come back and play some of these acoustics and
[40:00.240 --> 40:02.880]  and in place of the video from cab drivers and others it's totally clear and
[40:02.880 --> 40:07.360]  i'm not a you know former navy seal team six you know leader all and marine
[40:07.360 --> 40:11.200]  previously and you know the history channel shooting expert like you are
[40:11.200 --> 40:15.200]  but i can hear bup bup bup bup bup bup bup well and then 45 seconds later it's
[40:15.200 --> 40:18.160]  not an echo bam bam bam right on top of it i mean we're
[40:18.160 --> 40:22.240]  going to play that coming up this is ridiculously obvious is it not
[40:22.240 --> 40:27.920]  it is now i will get this caveat out there it's very important to be accurate
[40:27.920 --> 40:31.520]  echoes are very confusing and hearing anything through a microphone
[40:31.520 --> 40:35.280]  is confusing one of my best friends is probably the most
[40:35.280 --> 40:38.560]  the foremost authority on not terminal and
[40:38.560 --> 40:44.080]  unbolistics but but the the acoustics uh of these big cases and he he goes
[40:44.080 --> 40:47.440]  through he's got all these huge computer programs he analyzes everything
[40:47.440 --> 40:51.520]  but having said all that and and acknowledging that it is confusing
[40:51.520 --> 40:56.160]  after the fact to listen to a series of gunshots with the echoes i will say
[40:56.160 --> 41:01.920]  this uh some things are beyond i mean it's just it's it's a parent anyway
[41:01.920 --> 41:04.960]  even though you're listening to the echoes and even though you're listening
[41:04.960 --> 41:07.600]  it after the fact through through a microphone
[41:07.600 --> 41:12.240]  that just does change that acoustic signature it is still apparent that
[41:12.240 --> 41:17.280]  there's more than one shooter so one of the key points you you brought up uh
[41:17.280 --> 41:21.280]  i think very accurately as you hear something very muffled very far away
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.880]  and then all of a sudden uh shortly thereafter it's very loud very distinct
[41:26.880 --> 41:30.960]  that's a that's a far engagement and then a close engagement so
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.160]  unless somebody's got a time machine there's no other way to
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.160]  well sure and even if miles away an echo would be a second apart this is this
[41:38.160 --> 41:42.720]  is 30 40 seconds before and then and then she's
[41:42.720 --> 41:45.280]  at mandalay bay of the taxi driver and it's right above her
[41:45.280 --> 41:48.400]  i mean he's right there shooting out of the window
[41:48.400 --> 41:52.800]  yeah yeah and even if there if the let's just
[41:52.800 --> 41:55.520]  speculate let's say if the first string of fire
[41:55.520 --> 41:58.960]  were fired through a suppressor it would not sound that way
[41:58.960 --> 42:02.240]  sounds distinctly different right even though it would sound muffled
[42:02.240 --> 42:05.920]  the the sound is not the same type have they said there were suppressors though
[42:05.920 --> 42:09.520]  but i would agree the only way it's not is this is a suppressor
[42:09.520 --> 42:13.600]  yeah uh nobody said that that i've heard alex and it does not sound that way to
[42:13.600 --> 42:17.840]  me i was just i was just playing devil's advocate even if it were
[42:17.840 --> 42:21.040]  it would not sound the way that it that it does well by the way i mean i've
[42:21.040 --> 42:25.040]  talked to a lot of guys that have been uh it's a few of them at your level of
[42:25.040 --> 42:30.080]  expertise there's not many they say it's absolutely clear
[42:30.080 --> 42:33.600]  i feel i feel confident that uh we're we're hearing more than once
[42:33.600 --> 42:37.520]  and uh that takes a bigger picture so the official narrative's gonna have to
[42:37.520 --> 42:41.680]  change all right let's talk about the actual
[42:41.680 --> 42:44.400]  accusers when we come back and play some of these types and then
[42:44.400 --> 42:48.480]  what is the narrative well just like colonel schaffer said cia you name it
[42:48.480 --> 42:53.040]  the the target's the motive the the motive's the target i mean just like
[42:53.040 --> 42:55.600]  craig sorgher was just saying tacticalinsider.com's
[42:55.600 --> 42:59.600]  his website vetsforchildrescue.org stay with us
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.440]  prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream
[43:03.440 --> 43:07.440]  that even realtor.com is writing about it but the realtors are still embarrassed
[43:07.440 --> 43:10.880]  to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call
[43:10.880 --> 43:15.360]  uncle travis's guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness well
[43:15.360 --> 43:19.760]  the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers but the grasshoppers will
[43:19.760 --> 43:23.120]  still sing the tune if they can make money but maybe you don't have a
[43:23.120 --> 43:26.240]  hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your
[43:26.240 --> 43:30.320]  home theater into a radiation proof bunker there are still very effective

[48:02.080 --> 48:05.520]  just her it's it's people a mile away at other
[48:05.520 --> 48:09.280]  hotels saying yeah there's glass everywhere shell cases they shot these
[48:09.280 --> 48:13.440]  men and then they the police jumped on top of us and told us to get out of there
[48:13.440 --> 48:16.160]  and everybody's like huddling and it's in they're shooting footage inside the
[48:16.160 --> 48:20.000]  hotel and the police just made us shelter in place in here i mean there's
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.600]  just hours of this and these are real people this isn't made up
[48:25.600 --> 48:29.920]  and i've talked to the police here in austin sometimes they'll have a shooting
[48:29.920 --> 48:33.040]  on second street that's the elite area and those letters say it happened out on
[48:33.040 --> 48:38.400]  11th street and look i don't want to panic people but
[48:38.400 --> 48:43.040]  it's it's just incredible craig sorrier is our guest a former high-level
[48:43.040 --> 48:46.560]  operator with the navy seals host history and discovery channel
[48:46.560 --> 48:50.880]  television shows like top shot one of the top ballistics experts out there
[48:50.880 --> 48:55.680]  tactical insider dot com he's also doing vets for child rescue dot org and really
[48:55.680 --> 48:58.880]  doing a great job with documentaries that are coming out soon
[48:58.880 --> 49:02.080]  on that front but we're not going to talk about that and let the bad guys know
[49:02.080 --> 49:05.680]  when craig's about to be showing up at their doorstep here
[49:05.680 --> 49:10.160]  so before i go any further let's just get into any other points you'd like to
[49:10.160 --> 49:13.760]  make before i play this video craig
[49:13.760 --> 49:18.000]  well as far as the bona fides go uh moving forward on the ballistics alex
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.800]  i i i'm a i'm a ballistics expert for capital murder
[49:22.800 --> 49:26.400]  cases so i testify on on hardcore big-time cases
[49:26.400 --> 49:29.680]  with that so that's even more than the television
[49:29.680 --> 49:32.960]  credentials i'd lean on that a little bit to paint the picture and that's why
[49:32.960 --> 49:36.480]  i'm hesitant to say absolutely this or that until i've gone through
[49:36.480 --> 49:40.080]  personally the forensic evidence i just uh during the break i talked to a friend
[49:40.080 --> 49:44.240]  of mine that does the the audio and and he's the same way you know
[49:44.240 --> 49:47.680]  he said craig until i had the chance and pull off of some of these other cases
[49:47.680 --> 49:50.880]  and go through uh and analyze it i don't want to say
[49:50.880 --> 49:55.280]  absolutely this or that so that's uh a little bit of why i hesitate on things
[49:55.280 --> 49:57.920]  alex it's not that i don't feel confident but it's it's
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.600]  now understand you are a professional guy that does this in federal court cases
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.040]  your federal officer former navy seal i totally respect that look i'm no
[50:05.040 --> 50:08.320]  accuser's cut i know bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup bup
[50:08.320 --> 50:12.160]  and 45 seconds later boom boom boom you know 50 times louder
[50:12.160 --> 50:16.000]  something's going on is what other people reported it's what you hear
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.040]  uh and then of course we have the police what do you make of the police
[50:19.040 --> 50:21.600]  first saying no we think there could be multiple people
[50:21.600 --> 50:25.600]  in fact we we know there must be and we're looking at radicalization
[50:25.600 --> 50:28.880]  they don't say radicalization unless they're looking at radicalization is it
[50:28.880 --> 50:32.720]  that generally code word for islamic
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.040]  well not necessarily just islamic anymore i mean there there are so many
[50:37.040 --> 50:41.840]  people being spied on up by by exactly by george soros and other but it
[50:41.840 --> 50:45.760]  tends to have a leftist leanings one of them they call right wingers extremists
[50:45.760 --> 50:49.440]  weird right wingers are called extremists islamists or radical leftists are
[50:49.440 --> 50:53.040]  called radicalized right absolutely you're 100
[50:53.040 --> 50:55.760]  percent correct on that alex look you don't see people
[50:55.760 --> 50:59.760]  radicalized from the from the conservative right going off on mass
[50:59.760 --> 51:03.040]  murder benches that's just not part of their core values and what they're up
[51:03.040 --> 51:06.160]  to even if they're some sort of weird nazi
[51:06.160 --> 51:11.600]  you know kkk guys or something like that uh there's such a small number of
[51:11.600 --> 51:17.520]  those people anymore because we've all uh disavowed that as a nation and and
[51:17.520 --> 51:21.280]  all find it repugnant though he's got the left massively hyping
[51:21.280 --> 51:25.280]  massively hyping civil war october 1st to peak november 4th i mean how
[51:25.280 --> 51:29.440]  obvious is this look at the target all of the rhetoric and and the
[51:29.440 --> 51:32.560]  encouragement for violence is coming from the left so
[51:32.560 --> 51:36.800]  we've got a cultural problem in this country right now alex and we've got
[51:36.800 --> 51:40.560]  big-time political figures that that somebody
[51:40.560 --> 51:46.000]  refuses to prosecute that are inciting violence and encouraging them to start
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.120]  a civil war yet they are not arrested and put away
[51:49.120 --> 51:54.880]  i asked myself it had had george soros hillary clinton obama and others been
[51:54.880 --> 51:58.160]  prosecuted when they could have and should have would we even be here right
[51:58.160 --> 52:03.360]  now would we even be getting uh spinning up for a civil war or would it
[52:03.360 --> 52:06.960]  been would it have been put to bed like it should have and could have so i'm
[52:06.960 --> 52:11.600]  frustrated i i still encourage jeff sessions to to
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.360]  to step up and and drop the hammer on these crooks because they are inciting
[52:15.360 --> 52:18.640]  it right before our eyes and and yet nothing happened so it's
[52:18.640 --> 52:21.920]  well happening for a peaceful citizen to watch this just
[52:21.920 --> 52:26.400]  play out before us like a slow motion punch for a drunk guy you're like hey
[52:26.400 --> 52:29.280]  dude here it comes i mean you're you quit mouthing off this guy's gonna
[52:29.280 --> 52:32.400]  clock you you're sitting back and watching it'll go you know here it
[52:32.400 --> 52:36.480]  comes here it comes and then finally boom i feel like that guy i'm watching my
[52:36.480 --> 52:38.880]  country i'm like here this comes this is so stupid
[52:38.880 --> 52:43.600]  we could totally avoid this prosecute george soros prosecute hillary clinton
[52:43.600 --> 52:47.120]  prosecute those that are calling for this violence and put it into it send a
[52:47.120 --> 52:50.720]  message get some control and return to appease an order
[52:50.720 --> 52:55.520]  yet nobody will do it and here we go you're right and
[52:55.520 --> 52:59.200]  i mean it's crazy they say hashtag hunt republicans top democrat strategists
[52:59.200 --> 53:03.120]  go on fox news and say we need to kill more republicans and then cops get
[53:03.120 --> 53:06.560]  shot in louisiana in texas i've got the clips seen and says well
[53:06.560 --> 53:09.680]  cops need to reform themselves like they deserve to die
[53:09.680 --> 53:14.640]  it's like what planet is this this is this is surreal
[53:14.640 --> 53:18.320]  i'm sitting here scratching my head every day going where the arrest
[53:18.320 --> 53:22.080]  where is the intervention for the peaceful
[53:22.080 --> 53:26.240]  law-abiding public where are our representatives where
[53:26.240 --> 53:30.240]  where's our protection you know a lot of a lot of
[53:30.240 --> 53:33.840]  ticked off patriots are arm into the teeth going okay well if
[53:33.840 --> 53:36.640]  you know nobody's going to give peace of chance so you know god help them if
[53:36.640 --> 53:40.080]  they come my way and i think that's what all my sources and i haven't asked you
[53:40.080 --> 53:43.520]  this is one of my sources they think that that they're trying to
[53:43.520 --> 53:47.600]  trigger the patriots into a violent confrontation because they know we're
[53:47.600 --> 53:50.640]  winning peacefully intellectually they want to trigger
[53:50.640 --> 53:55.360]  the confrontation to somehow that they think they're going to win that
[53:55.360 --> 53:59.520]  well they're becoming more desperate the more they lose to donald trump
[53:59.520 --> 54:05.120]  though the the further they get down their list of contingencies of plans
[54:05.120 --> 54:09.840]  that they can try to execute to try to uh for
[54:09.840 --> 54:14.400]  this administration's agenda which is to make america great or just sabotaging
[54:14.400 --> 54:16.320]  america as you said at the start of the interview
[54:16.320 --> 54:19.600]  literally a 3.1 growth rate they said we never have that again
[54:19.600 --> 54:23.120]  they're trying to stop it all with with blocking tax cuts
[54:23.120 --> 54:27.120]  did you hear california just legalize giving people hiv knowingly
[54:27.120 --> 54:31.040]  and also giving blood knowing you have it's now a misdemeanor
[54:31.040 --> 54:35.120]  like the lowest level parking ticket if that is an example of scorched earth
[54:35.120 --> 54:39.760]  dynamite everything burn it all down this is cloud cuckoo land
[54:39.760 --> 54:43.600]  uh well we're going off the rails on this crazy train
[54:43.600 --> 54:50.240]  alex i mean it's just bizarre it's it's heartbreaking uh because the damage is
[54:50.240 --> 54:54.480]  real but it it's laughable and just how ridiculous
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.560]  and unacceptable and irrational all of this
[54:58.560 --> 55:02.080]  is from the from the radical left they're completely mentally ill
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.120]  with charge of anything and why on god's green earth that we allow them to
[55:07.120 --> 55:10.720]  continue for even one more day
[55:10.720 --> 55:14.560]  craig i want to play this clip uh again this is a local taxi driver i already
[55:14.560 --> 55:17.760]  mentioned her name earlier when it all starts the first few minutes
[55:17.760 --> 55:21.520]  that's what all my experts you included say first two minutes or so
[55:21.520 --> 55:24.720]  you hear multiple firing we know somebody first we're shooting the you
[55:24.720 --> 55:27.920]  know the fuel tanks and then it stops there's only
[55:27.920 --> 55:31.280]  shots coming out of the hotel so this is at mandalay bay right below where he's
[55:31.280 --> 55:47.280]  shooting here it is
[55:47.280 --> 55:51.920]  that sounds like it's coming from um farther away
[55:51.920 --> 55:58.160]  she's not even acoustic person she knows that barely here like a mile away
[55:58.160 --> 56:04.000]  here comes this is unedited here comes the big shots right where she's at
[56:04.000 --> 56:18.160]  right he's right above
[56:18.160 --> 56:21.680]  that's so loud it's drowning out the microphone that's a sound of a mic maxed out
[56:21.680 --> 56:25.680]  and it just goes on and on a few more times well it's not like a second later
[56:25.680 --> 56:29.920]  it's an echo no it is i mean craig what do you think of that
[56:29.920 --> 56:35.040]  well it's a lot more radical increase in volume than you would experience just
[56:35.040 --> 56:38.240]  going around a corner let's say the first string of fire
[56:38.240 --> 56:42.720]  the cab driver was behind a wall and then she drove around the wall and the
[56:42.720 --> 56:47.120]  sound then became louder this this sounds to me like a much greater
[56:47.120 --> 56:51.680]  increase in volume than just that would present and it looks like the new shots
[56:51.680 --> 56:54.320]  begin though before she's even gotten behind the new wall because i thought
[56:54.320 --> 56:57.440]  that too well maybe she moved but he watched it it starts and then she's
[56:57.440 --> 57:00.080]  moving and then it gets even louder as she goes around
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.560]  under because he's right up above her well she was the the first hand witness
[57:04.560 --> 57:09.360]  on the ground and like you said earlier common sense prevails i mean she we
[57:09.360 --> 57:13.760]  understand whether a sound is coming from close or far away and she even said
[57:13.760 --> 57:18.560]  it ah it sounds like it's really far away at first so i was like when you're
[57:18.560 --> 57:21.680]  deer hunting and you just hear like a you're like well it's like a mile away
[57:21.680 --> 57:25.600]  you can barely hear you yeah yeah and this was gave the same effect so i
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.280]  think it's it's pretty clear it sounds pretty clear
[57:29.280 --> 57:32.640]  so there is a cover-up going on and the sheriff's department sending signals but
[57:32.640 --> 57:35.360]  they're being told obviously don't for whatever reason
[57:35.360 --> 57:38.240]  we're gonna do five minutes with Craig Sawyer of technicalinsider.com
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.320]  and then we'll having well the stars of eyewide shut on
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.000]  getting into the satanism in the film and what's really behind that i
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.800]  personally have interviewed Vivian Kubrick the only interview she's done
[57:48.800 --> 57:51.920]  in 15 years about a group you developed living defense for us it took you over
[57:51.920 --> 57:56.240]  a year to do it why is this so good because people are actually waking up to
[57:56.240 --> 58:00.880]  the problem that pretty much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that
[58:00.880 --> 58:05.200]  i don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[58:05.200 --> 58:09.360]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything

[59:52.240 --> 59:56.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:56.960 --> 01:00:14.880]  coming to you from the former united states of america from deep in the heart
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.400]  of texas it's alex jones that's right the globalists are trying to kill america
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.000]  but if trump and all of us are successful out to retire all these liners
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.080]  without that for many years because uh there's a civil war going on we're
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.880]  retaking the country craig we know the police have said
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.000]  it's impossibly acting alone the sheriff's department
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.960]  we're looking at radicalization they're giving us clues but then they're being
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.320]  pressured to say oh but you know there was ballistics
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.160]  written on this note he's got 22 guns it's different ballistics you just do a
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.960]  rain i'm not a sniper like you top sniper but
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.080]  you know do the rangefinder have it set to your firearm
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.040]  400 500 yards away i mean that seems like zero in it
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.880]  400 yards uh and then just raise up higher we're going to go higher than
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.480]  that he was mainly shooting at the you know one corner of the stage
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.600]  uh what do you what do you make of that because it appears
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.120]  i mean we've got multiple shooters the evidence is showing uh we're not 100
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.720]  percent like 95 percent then then then why the cover up
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.480]  that's what leads me back to the bigger picture why there wouldn't
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:24.160]  there would need to be no manipulation and and pressure put on local law
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.360]  enforcement the sheriff's department by the feds if there were not
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.960]  a a narrative that they were desperate to hide
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.160]  if it were just the truth they would encourage the
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.440]  the locals just to stay quiet about the case and so that they could make their
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:42.720]  their prosecutions on a federal level but to ask them to change
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.560]  the facts and and not to tell certain things and to
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.680]  mislead people then that leads me to believe uh
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.600]  you know um that there there's something uh
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.360]  crooked going on and look i mean i i served under david nullton there
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:01.360]  in las vegas as a federal agent i don't trust that man as far as i can throw
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.320]  him he's one of the top dogs at the fbi before
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.120]  they got rid of him and he came to the air marshall service and then eventually
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.800]  air marshall service got rid of him that guy if he's in the indication of what
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.880]  the fbi is about these days then that that that agency's hurting
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.200]  and a and a shattered shell of what's what they once well you know they chopped
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.720]  it full of all these obama and soros operatives that's on record
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.240]  and since you mentioned things uh like like anomalies
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:34.560]  they told us over and over again uh i mean there's so many points to this
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.960]  and in fact he was just popping in my air a minute ago what was the point you
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.360]  were making
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:44.160]  there it is valet uh yeah i mean there's so many anomalies here valet
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.120]  entries prove paddock checked in three days before date given
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.880]  we got the receipt showing he had a woman in there days before later the next
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.160]  day of the sheriff's department admitted that i mean there's so many anomalies
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.040]  i'm trying to think of them all craig it gives me a headache we're being lied to
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.440]  well i've been busy with the vets for child rescue and the work that we're
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.800]  doing alex so i haven't heard everything that that's out there
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:10.400]  on this vegas case but one of the things that that i
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.440]  i think i should have heard but have not through a lot of these
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.880]  studies is the valet he said the word valet well
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.560]  whenever i go to check into a vegas hotel there's always you know valet
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.440]  there they've got the big cart and if you've got you know
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.280]  two or three people checking in there's two carts and they'll stack all your
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.400]  luggage and take them up a back elevator that nobody sees
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.960]  and bring them right to your room and put them down
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.360]  and uh i would look for that i don't i'm not necessarily convinced that
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.880]  that paddock would have shuttled his own baggage i mean he could have broken
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.600]  these weapons down and had them in regular suitcases
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.120]  and the valet would have taken them straight to his room for him so that's
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.920]  that's something i'm surprised i haven't heard somebody else mentioned
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.120]  because that's generally how it works well they've not denied this and homeland
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.400]  security raided the hotel again friday people aren't even knowing that that i
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.040]  had that from sources i mean they raided it we're getting in their
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:02.080]  computers and things so who knows what's going on then you've got the whole
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.000]  hotel being huge soros donors and giving to the the uh
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.520]  arab spring and giving to the muslim brotherhood that's all confirmed they
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.880]  told employees yeah that's a good that's a big
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.560]  factor alex and that's a man shame on us if we're not digging into that one big
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.280]  time if the owner of that hotel is given to the radicals and the giving
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.400]  to the anti-americans and there's a lot of money flow
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.440]  behind this arms deal and and the arrangements man that's
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.520]  that's huge that's huge it's a big indicating factor and must be followed
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.960]  up on big time well craig as soon as you're
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.000]  done the next few days the work you're doing the tannacleinsetter.com
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.680]  invest for childrescue.org please come back on let's do a big breakdown the
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.440]  latest uh on the war on pedophiles that's expanding thank you so much for
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.720]  your time thank you alex for having me on once again
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:53.840]  thank you that's a great guy right there federal forensic expert federal court
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.400]  i mean that's a top guy to get on about this he says
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:02.080]  stings to high heaven folks police departments across the country are now
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.280]  using an invasive surveillance tool called
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.040]  stingrays which use cell phone towers to intercept
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.520]  phone calls and text messages without warrants
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:18.400]  the technology comes courtesy of the fbi who have forced our nation's police
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.840]  departments into signing nondisclosure agreements
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.520]  forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.680]  needless to say this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.600]  and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.040]  where we now know that police are collecting information
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.040]  on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.840]  of any crimes once again more evidence that the police state isn't coming

[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.960]  that's up on drudgereport.com and info wars dot com
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.760]  that's out of the daily beast stanley cubrick's right hand man speaks
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.920]  the personal toll of working with a genius then it's a very flattering
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:59.360]  interview julian davis is a big actress and dancer and out in
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.640]  hollywood and hundreds of films i'm not going to get into a whole bio
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.160]  but she was in stanley cubrick's eyes wide shut
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:09.440]  and she's the lady in the satanic ritual who they kill
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.920]  and later he's got to go look at her dead body uh that is tom cruz does
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.040]  and so i was walking along a few weeks ago here in the morning when david
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.240]  night's on weekdays 8 a.m to 11 a.m and i say
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.760]  wow what's that stanley cubrick news i see and who's that lady now and i
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.320]  recognize her i said is that the lady they kill in the movie
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.560]  and they said yeah yeah so i was like wow so i wanted to get her on
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.240]  because i don't want to break with confidence of what
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.080]  um vivian cubrick who was to a great extent
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.320]  one of stanley cubrick's protege was his favorite daughter that's admitted
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.880]  i didn't just believe the stuff she told me she came to one of my events in
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:50.640]  dallas four years ago and just told me just for days she was wild stuff
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:55.120]  uh and but she was pretty smart too she had some insights into my own life that
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.320]  nobody else had so she definitely a tune in lady and she told me the secrets of
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.120]  stanley cubrick which you could definitely write a book about
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.040]  but i'm not going to because it was done in confidence uh but uh
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.800]  so i but but if we get this from somebody else maybe she's got clues or
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.320]  maybe she's got pieces but just as we see in the news all the occultism and
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.080]  now things like eyes wide shut being done officially at big parties and
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.360]  fashion shows inside catholic churches in london
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.520]  uh what is going on but what was it like here's the big question to be in
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.560]  eyes wide shut uh with tom cruise and of course his
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.800]  wife nicole kedman and then i remember from i wasn't a big hollywood guy at the
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.360]  time but i knew people hollywood they said oh my gosh
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.000]  cubrick doesn't want 24 minutes cut he's throwing fits he has final cut he says
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.760]  no so contractually they couldn't cut it even though he
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.960]  gone over budget and then they cut the time
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.200]  and he had a heart attack and died so the question is was he killed we're
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:57.840]  blurring this out so folks don't don't don't see the full
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:04.560]  litany but julien davis uh that's j-u-l-i-e-n-n-e davis uh
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:09.200]  julien davis dot com is her website so instead of me babbling over this whole
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.840]  history uh because i mean imagine you got some treasure
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.360]  shows of knowledge there was great controversy surrounding this film
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.600]  and what was in those 20 24 minutes so start wherever you'd like thanks for
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.360]  joining us hey thanks alex for having me
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.040]  um you know really when i shot the film
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.880]  they didn't tell me any information at all we were really clueless i hate to
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.360]  tell you that and i i don't want to throw a big wet blanket on
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.400]  um the theory that something happened to him that was nefarious
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:49.360]  but honest to god he was not a young 70 um and so maybe the stress of
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.600]  finally finishing the edit or whatever his body just went i'm done
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.360]  you know well he would totally commit to stuff like as you said 24 hours a day
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.240]  somebody's not sleeping and not even using drugs i mean not even using drugs to do it
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.920]  we were working very late nights we started our our hours especially during
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.920]  those whole ritual scenes the hours we started at 2
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.720]  p.m and would break it to 2 30 in the morning
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.240]  sometimes three well did you i mean did you ever talk to cubrick when you're on
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:24.160]  the set about why oh i see all the time all the time smart man
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.240]  didn't like to talk about himself too much didn't like to talk about his
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.960]  projects except for he did talk about ai he was very excited about ai so i was
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.760]  because he was gonna make that movie next yes he was and i remember him talking
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.360]  to me about it because well i'm from a kind of computer background
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:47.280]  not me but my family and he started talking about it and i said stanley
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:50.960]  you haven't even finished you know filming this film let alone
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.040]  editing so but yeah he was very excited about it was a shame
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.800]  because it would have been an entirely different and in my opinion better
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:05.040]  don't have he done it did you hear on the set or later about the controversy
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.200]  of why they cut 24 minutes
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.960]  well sure um one of the reasons they cut that time
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:18.000]  is that they thought that was a little bit too salacious for american markets so
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.960]  there is a longer version for europe but and you know my gosh i need to see that
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.840]  immediately oh because i've been invited to these
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.760]  things you know uh below the uh the on the caves
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.600]  there in in england if i've ever gone to those i just i i guess i should see
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.520]  what i've missed though there's just more
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:42.720]  you know more sex scenes really um scenes that i wasn't those
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.960]  the uh quote action of the orgy scenes i wasn't involved with
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.640]  did you ever ask where he got the idea for this
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.520]  no in fact to see i know all about it but i can't tell you
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:01.520]  okay so it was very very secretive uh and you know when i booked that film i
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.520]  was a nobody so he wasn't going to divulge that
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.480]  information to me i'm sure tom knew what was going on
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.840]  but you know even tom was a bit closed-lipped in that in that respect
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.520]  they didn't really talk about the film they didn't talk about the story
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.160]  um i mean since that time you know i know that there are
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.240]  eyes wide shut parties going on all over the world
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.800]  um parties that i have not gone to um i'm not
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:34.800]  into that kind of thing so yeah well they got the original hellfire club uh
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.720]  at one of the two big british famous universities and then when and then they
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.120]  even if you don't go to the university you get invited to go down the
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.320]  down in the caves and do it but there's vivian kubrick when she
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.400]  just popped up and i i i checked around it was vivian kubrick did the music
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.840]  for apocalypse now i'm not apocalypse now for a full metal jacket
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.200]  you name it and then there she was telling me all this wild stuff
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.000]  it was pretty crazy i would love to hear it but i can understand if you can't
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.560]  share well no i mean it's off record you know
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.920]  that's the problem is people want to tell you stuff
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.120]  and then it's off record and you can't tell people
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:14.960]  well you know there is a lot of dark stuff going on i mean i'm not one to
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.960]  um to entertain uh conspiracy theories all the time but
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.000]  with all conspiracy theory i i tend to think there's some truth in it so i'm
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.640]  just going to keep it over here and keep it in mind
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.640]  and just see what else transpires but there's there's a lot of dark stuff
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.360]  going on you know i'm sure you've touched on it the
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.840]  pedophile rings and um satanism and all that stuff and
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:45.760]  obviously there's elements of that in this film um
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:51.760]  you know for me personally i haven't wanted to kind of delve too
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.920]  heavily into that stuff just because it it does creep me out i just i really
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.720]  don't want to be the last my next question because i didn't
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:01.840]  work with the crew on this i'm about to see my pants just real
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.800]  interviews i saw you on night show how did you get on there
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.640]  what is your political view how was one of the stars when you get killed in the
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:13.200]  movie it's pretty important double part how how are you now out talking
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.520]  so this is awesome oh you mean about about conservatism and things like that
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.240]  yes your political views which would get you ostracized
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.400]  obviously yeah hell yeah um well i started off
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:29.040]  last year uh somebody approached me about writing for heat street magazine
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.240]  and writing about some of my experiences for eyes wide shut
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:36.240]  and one article turned into two articles turned into 10 articles turned
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.120]  into 20 articles etc unfortunately heat street closed
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:44.480]  and um one of the editors went over to fox
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.320]  and i thought you know i'm really enjoying writing and uh i'm enjoying
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.440]  finally coming clean about how i felt how i feel about
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.400]  conservatism what's happening in the world today
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.240]  and uh and so i went to fox wrote this article
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.320]  blew up in the press had no idea i mean i figured it was just going to be
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.560]  you know just one of many articles in the off-ed section
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.960]  um yeah just blew up um i'm happy it did though
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.640]  i think that the the issues that i've been discussing and
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.320]  what what i believe to be true is something that
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:24.880]  everybody should be discussing we need to figure out a way to
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.560]  change uh the path that the world is going down
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.280]  i think we're going there's a big shift happening because for me it's not even
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.320]  about conservative or liberal but i get to be separated you say conservative
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.880]  it's just like i'm not in this big hollywood cult
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.080]  you know with the wine steens everything else it's all coming down
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.760]  i like common sense so let's talk about where you see all this going straight

[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.680]  be involved with because i'd be on national television shows
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.520]  speak of the devil i was out once in la then once in vegas and i was with a
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.560]  major director for dinner i wanted to go dinner with me and he said you know the
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.760]  hellfire club that benjamin franklin went to is real
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.720]  and you're gonna get an invite to this major university in england
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.680]  and if you want to join us you should just go be part of the event it's down
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:01.520]  these caves you'll have a good time
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:06.880]  and i said well what's it like it was kind of like eyes wide shut and i said no
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.960]  and so if you want to go inside baseball that's what goes on
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:15.680]  he told me the invitation was coming months later the invitation
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:19.280]  to the major university one of the most famous in the world
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.280]  showed up at the office i mean i'll just say it he said
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.240]  oxford is going to invite you but then that's just the invite
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.840]  the speech to the faculty of oxford it wasn't just speak at oxford it was speak
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:33.760]  to oxford and i remember nico acosta the the uh
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.560]  she's like gondy spoke there and martin was a king and all this he said
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:39.200]  this is actually to the faculty i can do it i said no am i doing it because
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:42.320]  that's not what it is because i've already been told
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.600]  you're going to be given this offer and at the time it's a major director you
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.840]  know you okay this person's messing with me but
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.880]  them the the creepiness of it you know the whole deal like join these people
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:01.200]  what the hell are they involved in so we have a hollywood actress dancer
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:06.800]  joining us julian davis and she was in eyes wide shut she gets
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.720]  sacrificed in eyes wide shut i know they cut 24 minutes out of the film
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.360]  no she probably signed a non-disclosure about was in i'll have her back for a
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.480]  full hour soon now she's a syndicate of columnists doing a great job
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:19.440]  going through the intimidation of being a patriot conservative and
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.160]  being more successful i think that's the story here for what i got from her but
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:26.080]  this is the time we have left here you've heard my little story but
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:30.640]  the bottom line on cubrick was he was not an insider
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.320]  i'll give the big secret out he was but without giving any details
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:41.200]  he was dialed into the ether of what they were doing so they could see him
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:45.520]  he could see them and that was why he had to hide out in england it was so
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.120]  tortured and freaked out whether it was 2001 space
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:52.320]  odyssey or whether it was you know any of these big films
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:56.560]  he was being given the art types not them and they were very very jealous of it
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.760]  and that's i'm gonna give you the whole story uh it's been i never give up
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.560]  sources but this is behind the scenes stuff i've seen to save for safety quite
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:06.800]  frankly that he like the cia came and i already read this before but i was told
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.240]  it the cia came and said how do you know about planar and how do you know about
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.600]  the decoders on the b-52s and how do you know about the nuke attacks
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.120]  and he had to tell him i i just had a dream about it so
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.400]  okay i'm giving some big secrets out here uh i'm not planning to write a big
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.360]  book about it but we got six minutes left thank you for joining us i'll be
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.800]  coming back for a full hour in the future what is your big brain trust on
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.560]  just this whole crazy world we're living in
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:35.440]  i think it was funny during the uh the break you mentioned the new world order
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.160]  um i think that's absolutely real and it's very interesting that
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:46.080]  the resist movement what are they resisting they're part of it they're
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.320]  part of the establishment they're part of the new world order
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.760]  we on the other side we are the true rebels
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:58.800]  we are the resistance i think it's insane what's happening today i think we
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.800]  need to fight against it i think we need to do everything we can to continue to
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:10.080]  fight against it we need to keep our guns we need to i feel like america is the
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:17.120]  world's last great hope against this and if we don't
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:25.840]  um make sure that the new world order um if we if we allow them to take control
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.960]  we're going to be in big trouble big trouble so have you in fact i'm just
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:36.560]  changing subject really quickly have you seen the gotard tunnel opening
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.520]  opening ceremony in switzerland have you seen that
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:48.720]  no say it again i heard about it oh go and watch it um it is a full
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:55.120]  satanist uh show go and watch it and when you see
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:58.560]  that you you you look at all of these things you look at
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.720]  that you look at these eyes wide shut parties the new world order the
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.640]  the pedophile rings all the stuff you think there's something really funny
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.600]  going on here well i'll just say this they did come
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.440]  after stanley cubrick for what he was doing and uh
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.840]  they want to know how he knew and and and he didn't even know he just said it i
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.040]  just i just have this idea and this is it and why are
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.600]  they so angry it was like he was just dialed into what was going on
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.920]  stanley's a very smart man very smart man and uh
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:36.160]  he read a lot he researched a ton and whether he was out and about which he
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.400]  wasn't very much he mostly was at his home very reclusive
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:44.480]  yes but uh he had a lot of people out there
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:49.440]  doing things for him seeing seeing things for him being his eyes and ears
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.240]  yeah well i hope you'll come back for a full hour with us soon because i'm just
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.040]  really excited about the work of it and i've read some of your articles as well
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.480]  but did i get it wrong like you you you came out with your
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:05.760]  conservatism out of the closet and then you were more successful by doing so
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.960]  um well i wasn't more successful in hollywood
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.120]  i've definitely gotten some attention amongst conservative press
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.200]  um and i've been dissed by bill maher so that's something
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.440]  um but uh you know the way i look at
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.480]  at my career in hollywood most of the stuff that i do is independent
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:31.200]  and um i could afford to speak up because i'm not
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.560]  ensconced with a network or a big studio right now
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.000]  and i wish others would but i understand why they don't because
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.400]  you know their paycheck is but the nfl's down 31 percent this year
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.520]  50 plus percent the last three years the 20 percent on there
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:49.760]  and it's accelerating and hollywood's falling apart i mean don't they get that
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:54.560]  they're destroying the golden goose they don't understand because they're in
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.680]  their little bubble and you know when you're in
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.240]  hollywood circles they assume that you feel exactly the same way
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.440]  they do and so they'll say things where they
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.120]  just expect you to go oh yeah totally agree
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.320]  meanwhile those of us who are conservative whether we're in the
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.760]  closet or not usually go mm-hmm uh-huh you know does a conservative to me it
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.840]  just means common sense uh yeah because i'm not against anybody
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.280]  because they're liberal i just want common sense that always work you know
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:28.320]  did you hear about california legalizing it's like a misdemeanor now
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.560]  putting hiv into the blood supply and giving people age did you hear that
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:38.400]  no no i did it sounds insane i've got the la times here just like it's totally
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.680]  normal that's a whole other discussion for us to have
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.880]  here it is governor jerry brown signed a bill friday that lowers
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.320]  from a felony to misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.440]  with hiv without disclosing the infection the measure also
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.600]  applies to those who give blow without telling
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.920]  the blood bank that they are hiv positive that's la times
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.360]  wow looks like i'm going to be donating blood to
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:05.360]  keep for myself just in case that's that's pretty
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.240]  you know you've got to come back to get more into eyes wide shut here in the
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:11.120]  future but just was there was there i mean like you get killed in the movie

[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:19.440]  uh no and um i remember talking to todd field about this
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.880]  todd and i both agreed that we didn't you know
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.080]  in the film it says basically that i had an od
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.000]  but todd and i both agreed i was killed and so was he never got back home to his
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  family after playing that keyboard so yeah um but no i mean i
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.680]  obviously tom and nickle were privy to the entire script but
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:43.840]  i was just a little minion at the time so i was not privy to that information i

[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.280]  talk to roger stone here in a minute you know i called him up this morning and i
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.000]  said you gotta come on because it isn't about corker
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.680]  saying he's not gonna run again it's a it's not about this loser it's about the
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:47.360]  anatomy of media deception because i know the whole
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.160]  back story of corker not just from roger stone but from others
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:54.480]  i mean what a nasty dirty creature and the fact that you have this big judge
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:34:00.400]  roger more win in alabama and corker running for the hills and then cnn
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.560]  puts out a story that oh trump claimed that corker begs for endorsement as
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:10.960]  false sources say they just turn everything upside down
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:14.720]  so it's just it's not about corker it's about illustrating
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.520]  with this example how they manipulate every story they engage in
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.040]  we'll talk to roger stone here in a moment uh first off

[01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:21.760]  now let me say this everyone knows it's been watching for a long time
[01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.640]  that my pull star my north star is the truth
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:30.400]  it's more important than myself my children anything else
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:34.880]  because if there's not truth they have no future anyways the truth is number one
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.600]  so when we're in trouble i'll tell you we're in trouble
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.640]  when we're winning i'm going to tell you we're winning okay
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:45.360]  trump's manifestation of the awakening but the economy's up 3.1 percent growth
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:48.320]  rate hundreds of billions of dollars new jobs
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:54.400]  the globalists are panicking uh the democratic party is a mentally ill
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.240]  elite party that no one listens to the republican party is getting rounded in
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:01.520]  every special election state and local of the
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.360]  democrats have lost every election in the last nine months since the election
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.880]  of trump i mean this is a ultra dominant domination
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.560]  that said we've got to maintain to intrude to our cause
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:20.240]  but also understand their insanity is intensifying to take every fact and
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:23.280]  invert it so you basically take anything they do turn
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.320]  upside down you're getting a clear picture so that that's kind of the
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.360]  decoder wheel here we're engaged in but again
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.000]  corker is a loser corker is resigning because of corruption
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.600]  investigations that we're going to break here that's not about for a year
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.800]  before trump even got elected i got it from other sources i asked stone about
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.560]  it six months ago he said yeah stone has the whole nine yards of
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:49.280]  corkers literal beyond brown nosing i mean we're talking
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.840]  supplication to trump and and it was just illustrates how pathetic they are
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.480]  that they even take these losers that are failing
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:00.720]  who are having to resign and step down because they know the big sweeps coming
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.520]  you got eric prance who is a patriot folks
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.160]  anti-globalist patriot uh they get ready to run out and you know
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.680]  out west so joining us is roger stone this segment the next
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:15.920]  to break it all down but again corker isn't worth this discussion
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:23.040]  it's cnn saying corker spurned trump trump's a loser no corker gave up corkers
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.280]  running around with his tail behind his legs
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:30.000]  corker is a joke corker is gone it just shows the inversion of reality
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.200]  they engage in roger stone well alex uh you're absolutely right
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:39.920]  all the guys mainstream media seek to now deify as some kind of
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.560]  truth teller uh robert corker i mean you may recall
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:49.680]  that corker uh appeared at trump tower during the time
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:54.480]  that donald trump was openly looking uh at running
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:39:00.640]  and uh you know chris christy their gingrich mike pence and so on of course
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.960]  corker told the media that he'd been summoned to trump tower like it was an
[01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.200]  audition when in fact corker invited himself had reached out to the
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:12.480]  presumptive nominee and asked to meet with him
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.040]  at the end of the meeting which was really inconclusive it had no point
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:20.640]  trump said now bob if you want to go downstairs and
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.760]  tell him that you're under consideration i understand of course you
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.400]  understand you're not of course corker went down and hinted that he was on the
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.600]  shortlist many people think this was an effort
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.320]  alex to stave off the fbi who were looking into a
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.760]  a re uh a uh re based uh what you know a real estate
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.240]  investor trust based in corkers uh corker's home town in chattanooga
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.640]  where there have been unusual billing practices and dozens of dozens of lucris
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.600]  factories sure it's well known the democrats want
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:54.400]  weak republicans that are compromised they let them be corrupt just like
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.240]  millers corrupt if they play along and corker is another
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:01.360]  literal turd about to be flushed out of the toilet bowl
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.440]  well he and senator mark warner had been making a fortune in a
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:09.840]  hedge fund where they were essentially shorting the housing market
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:13.920]  uh using privileged information that they could obtain as a senator
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.680]  uh it's extraordinary uh and there are many many other uh
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:24.400]  avenues here while fargo pickbacks and uh and other
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.440]  matters this guy here exactly right he retreated uh under investigation under
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:32.960]  heavy pressure and then the cnn recycles him like
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.800]  he were above trump he's a loser not running again
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:42.880]  destroyed by the breitbart info wars trump revolution and then they again
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.680]  their viewers are reading this like oh look corker doesn't like trump
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:49.280]  what do you think a blackwater founder prince weighing senate run
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.680]  uh right now but i tell you losing a crook like robert
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:57.120]  corker a man who likes lbj and the senate look honest
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.600]  for a man of the integrity and quality of eric prince would be like day and night
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:07.200]  i mean he is a patriot a guy who puts his money where his mouth is a central
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:14.560]  player uh in the uh in the trump upset uh falsely accused of uh
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:17.840]  you know of colluding with the russia completely false
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.480]  focus just like all the other false that can he win it while i'm against that
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:24.880]  neocon he's gonna get ready to run against i mean
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:31.200]  that guy's like a democrat out there uh it you know it's a small state uh and it
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.760]  will be uphill but eric prince is not a man who is afraid of a challenge uh
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:39.680]  right now you see uh in or the roe more victory it leaves
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.520]  it over the swamp creature with their strange
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.680]  uh that you know it doesn't matter the money doesn't matter i mean
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:53.920]  strange spent 10 million of michael connell's money 10 million dollars
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:57.680]  to lose roe more spent less than two million i thought it was like 30 million
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:02.400]  the media said well if you include all the super PACs and so on
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:07.440]  uh he says there's the big boys all the special interests the NRA everybody
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.160]  was weighing in now the idea that is that
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:14.320]  gun owners in alabama knew that lucid strange as attorney general been a
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.000]  pretty much a gun grabber sure so here's the facts we all have the internet
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.120]  now we're checking into candidates that's the end of these guys claiming

[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:46.880]  pathetic i mean i'm serious he's got a power over me he's so weak
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:51.920]  going trumps horrible throwing people packages of paper towels trumps just
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.840]  having fun and saying yes and they just sit there and all act like oh
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:48:58.800]  we're powerful when they have no viewers and they're a joke it's like
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:02.240]  they're only there to be disruptive why am i even covering them that's why i
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:05.280]  haven't even covered yet five nights a week they got a show called the
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:08.880]  opposition where they claim they're me and sell this crap
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.920]  it's like they are done folks they're still disrupted they're still dangerous
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:17.120]  they still could go fund some guy they'll kill people that you know in
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.280]  los vegas but i don't think they have any more power but what will their death
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:26.000]  rattle their death rows be like roger stone
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:32.240]  his phone just dropped you gotta love cell phones
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:37.680]  he couldn't make a skyport tonight which is a congenital issue with roger skype
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:40.800]  but we'll get his take on that as soon as he can
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:46.800]  but seriously i mean the globalist want you
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:50.560]  to have hiv in the blood if you have a car wreck they want
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:55.840]  to have sex with you and give you hiv because that then you are now in the
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:59.120]  same club it's like we're miserable we're gonna make you miserable it's like
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.240]  what and and they always just attach well it's for the
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.000]  children roger stone what do you make of all this what
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.120]  do you make of the suicide of the democratic party the suicide of the
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:12.000]  republican party and just their desperate attempt
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.320]  like their rearguard action is Humpty Dumpty brian stelter
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:21.600]  who is the most saddening comedy you've ever seen trying to act powerful male
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.920]  and authoritative i mean is this cnn's idea of a joke
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:30.160]  well look it is politically correct uh and you have
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.160]  what is getting to be near hysteria on the intellectual
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.160]  of media left about their inability to destabilize
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:41.920]  and dislodge down the more he does the better he
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:46.160]  does the more they hate it uh there's no compromise in the
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.920]  fact that they're egging robert newler on to a
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:56.720]  upcoming newler deep state coup uh you saw james clapper out yesterday saying
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:00.720]  that if bantafort testifies trump will have to resign this
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:04.800]  i'm sorry i forgot i should have you on about this this is the biggest news sorry
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:09.120]  ken star you talked about it for last week five days ago
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:12.560]  ken star says the indictments are coming so that's a big news
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:17.840]  they're going to try indictments of who what does this signify
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:22.000]  uh there's there's no question that they've weaponized the justice department
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.160]  our own justice department ironically and what i'm convinced is a coming
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:31.440]  coup we predicted here at info wars now for months and we will be proven out
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.600]  this is not paranoia and my fear of course is that the generals will
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:39.360]  walk our president our king to the gallows
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:42.960]  i mean i because they're a bunch of sellouts you know i agree and
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:47.520]  we have to understand folks we've gotten here because america breeds cowards now
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.760]  and people that go with msm if you believe in msm it's a tiny
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:56.000]  small group of viewers it's it's not reality but there's these mental patients
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.240]  that want to be somebody and they keep buying into it trump somebody
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:04.400]  because he's not part of it you're somebody i'm somebody roger somebody
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:06.880]  matt drudge is somebody because we built our own thing
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.320]  like america and it's just like good god
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:14.480]  good god do you not see the traitorous garbage we're dealing with
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:20.080]  well and uh and just the torrent of hate of hate uh that is tossed our way uh
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:24.000]  when we simply try to express our own first amendment it only encourages me
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.080]  roger well i'm i'm undaunted look i'm right now
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:32.640]  alex i am rolling down that i've had south have dinner with our fellow
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:37.520]  revolutionary milo so we can uh begin plotting the next
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:43.600]  move against the global so sweet name was a ship the americana dauntless
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:47.600]  well i don't know that i uh deserve the name of a ship although my favorite
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:51.680]  name of the ship is the uss ronald ragan which right now seems to be
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.080]  moving into place very near north korea and for what i think is
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:00.560]  the support well that's my next issue
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.440]  that's my next issue what do you think trump's
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:07.680]  comment about the calm before the storm is with the us attack force is moving
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:10.800]  into place that's exactly what i think it is i
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:14.400]  think the rocket man has exhausted the big man's patience
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:18.240]  i think the orange man is about to take the rocket man out and that's why the
[01:53:18.240 --> 01:53:20.640]  democrats are crapping their pants because they want to
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.640]  supplicate before communism they want to worship it they wanted to give the nukes
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:28.800]  give the missiles to it and then shut it up and then think america capitulate
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:32.880]  in its face as a chess piece for china didn't happen
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:36.800]  well and here i think it's already a little secret is that trump has very
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:40.800]  skillfully closed the chinese off from their north korea
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:44.160]  communist brothers i think they're working with us not with them
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:47.440]  they're going to stand aside while we take out the little rocket man that's
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:51.440]  trump diplomacy something barack obama could never accomplish
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:54.640]  in eight years of trying to get their assistance while so you're saying the
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:58.000]  word is the calm before the storm trump is getting ready to hit north korea
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.960]  after they threaten to nuke the u.s because i have all these leftist
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.960]  friends and ron paul's a great guy i know you helped his campaign
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:07.840]  and i got ron paul and i'm like look i don't want war and i didn't agree with
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.240]  all these other wars but north korea's threatening to nuke us
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:13.440]  and they aren't doing all this stuff and you know we gave them the weapons and
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:16.000]  it's very provocative to shoot missiles over japan
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.360]  he's like oh you're in neocon you want war they don't have nukes
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:24.640]  yes they do have nukes well look i think ron paul is a patriot and i generally
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:27.760]  agree with him that a strong national defense is
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:31.920]  greatly superior to this neocon wandering around the globe looking for
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:36.400]  expensive and deadly trouble with none of our business he's not wrong but
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:40.320]  he does also have to recognize the difference between being a libertarian
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:44.320]  and not pacifist there are some very bad people out there who don't
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:50.400]  wish us well isis is a leftover thread from neocon disasters
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:54.640]  exactly and will be i mean iran says they'll principally attack us now
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:57.840]  but my point is just because our government has problems doesn't mean
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:02.320]  every other government's an angel it's like this narcissistic or borderline
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.240]  personality thing where either america's good or they're bad no
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:09.760]  how about north korea is a blood-sucking evil communist country
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:13.920]  i don't want war with them but the guy is so belligerent what is his problem
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:16.640]  roger but he's the one that keeps starting the new
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:22.400]  cost not the other way around i mean uh a heat this is he's a provocateur here
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:25.680]  i understand why we don't belong in afghanistan i understand why we don't
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.840]  belong in iraq because we were there were no real exactly but just because
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:35.440]  america has problems doesn't mean north so so you're saying from your intel
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:38.640]  i mean trump's already said it calm before the storm that that that we are
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:44.240]  getting ready to hit north korea uh that's my very best intelligence
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:48.160]  coming out of both my uh my military industrial sources some of my
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:53.120]  white house sources uh that's why uh i think the president was
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:57.040]  bruskin putting down rex tellers didn't in the tweet
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:01.120]  now everybody's talking about the coming rex it that's coming because i think
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.040]  he's gone by december presidents lost confidence and started with
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.360]  charlton so when he wouldn't back up the commander in chief in an effort to
[01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:14.000]  kowtow and brown knows the mainstream media and that's why they're saying now
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.480]  this rex is addled and seen all things is cnn and still has viewers
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:21.840]  but it's just where these old people they i'm not it's old folks in general but
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.120]  old folks that still think mainstream media is king when it's so uncool
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:28.000]  he has really bad mouth the president he's done a lot so now they're telling
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.720]  rex killers and resign shouldn't trump fire him before that
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:37.600]  well uh you know the problem is that when the president exercises that authority
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.240]  the mainstream media then used it to show a lack of stability uh
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.480]  in what is a very tumultuous court i mean to be honest with you alex i kind of
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:49.360]  view the president at this point like the good king
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:53.520]  locked in the tower by a group of bad knights who claim to be loyal but in
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:58.160]  fact are undermining it our obligation is to free the good king so he
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:01.920]  pursues policies for the people now that's right roger let's talk soon roger
