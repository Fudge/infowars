[03:25.720 --> 03:29.320]  these power trips this has been the narrative behind the scenes for years
[03:29.320 --> 03:36.000]  building towards the pretext to roll out TSA federal security gun forces on the
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.320]  streets of America you notice they've been beta testing it now it's all coming

[08:33.280 --> 08:37.560]  talking to reporters we're gonna be in place in the mountain village in
[08:37.560 --> 08:44.040]  Switzerland we're gonna have Jim Tucker over there American Free Press net also
[08:44.040 --> 08:50.720]  for RT the one the only Luke Radowski founder of we are change is already in
[08:50.720 --> 08:55.560]  Europe in Barcelona preparing to make his way into Switzerland out of Spain and
[08:55.560 --> 09:00.560]  we're gonna be talking to other reporters as well like Charlie Skelton and
[09:00.560 --> 09:04.720]  we've got the Watson brothers in England who will continually be in contact
[09:04.720 --> 09:10.320]  with the reporters in Switzerland and we have Aaron Dykes Rob do Rob Jacobson
[09:10.320 --> 09:15.160]  Kurt Nemo and the rest of the team that are going to be working very closely with
[09:15.160 --> 09:19.160]  all of our sources that are going to be at Bilderberg and some of our sources
[09:19.160 --> 09:24.880]  that have sources within Bilderberg now why is that so important well two years
[09:24.880 --> 09:29.920]  before they imploded the subprime mortgage market inside Bilderberg sources
[09:29.920 --> 09:34.280]  said that was the plan in 2008 we were able to call it with total precision in
[09:34.280 --> 09:38.520]  the film in game out one year before the implosion that they claimed came out
[09:38.520 --> 09:42.440]  of nowhere Jim Tucker was able to predict a full year before the fall the
[09:42.440 --> 09:46.680]  Berlin wall that the wall was going to fall and the deals had already been made
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.120]  and between the Russian government through the East German government
[09:52.120 --> 09:56.240]  because they can no longer control their population and their own stasi we're
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.040]  starting to rebel against them because when a corrupt system loses the support
[10:01.040 --> 10:05.880]  of the general population it cannot stand if they resist and then it did fall
[10:05.880 --> 10:10.160]  Tucker got laughed at for that six months before Margaret Thatcher was
[10:10.160 --> 10:16.600]  basically run out even though she had high approval ratings Tucker broke down
[10:16.600 --> 10:19.240]  that that was going to happen and then interviewed her after the fact and she
[10:19.240 --> 10:24.120]  said yes it was Bilderberg that drove her out you saw three and a half years
[10:24.120 --> 10:32.360]  ago 2007 now almost four years ago I guess the fact that Governor Rick Perry
[10:32.360 --> 10:36.400]  out of the blue went to Bilderberg and the media ignored the fact that he was
[10:36.400 --> 10:39.680]  there until we forced the issue and then the Dallas Morning News and others did
[10:39.680 --> 10:43.120]  have to report to the Bilderberg group and of course we said then look for him
[10:43.120 --> 10:48.320]  to run for president and now that he's gearing up for that also three months
[10:48.320 --> 10:53.960]  before George Bush totally changed directions in 2008 saying that he
[10:53.960 --> 10:58.880]  believed in global warming and wanted carbon taxes Tucker said from Greece that
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.520]  that was the intel from his Bilderberg sources he has three maybe I'm not even
[11:04.520 --> 11:10.360]  supposed to say that much he has three and he's told me off the record the type
[11:10.360 --> 11:13.840]  of sources they are I'm just gonna leave it at that and he's proven he's got the
[11:13.840 --> 11:20.280]  sources he's got the real sources inside we're gonna be there well via
[11:20.280 --> 11:25.400]  telephone talking to him and via video Skype connections interviewing Mr. Tucker
[11:25.400 --> 11:29.400]  so we're gonna be there through Tucker and through Luke Radowski was also gonna
[11:29.400 --> 11:35.120]  have video Skype there on the ground in Switzerland so very very exciting we're
[11:35.120 --> 11:39.240]  gonna have great folks working with info wars there on site and Jim Tucker is
[11:39.240 --> 11:44.080]  joining us coming up here in about 20 minutes from now Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[11:44.080 --> 11:49.640]  dealing with his breakdown analysis how the Empire will prevail will Washington
[11:49.640 --> 11:54.200]  foment war between China and India we have that report he's gonna be joining
[11:54.200 --> 11:58.800]  us and then Mike Adams forensic evidence emerges that European a coalized
[11:58.800 --> 12:04.120]  superbug was bioengineered to produce human fatalities now I said that last
[12:04.120 --> 12:10.280]  Friday and it emerged over the weekend that it is a superbug probably
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.960]  engineered British Intel's responses to claim that Al Qaeda made it have you
[12:14.960 --> 12:20.560]  believe that I got a bridge I'm ready to sell you now the big news the economic
[12:20.560 --> 12:25.960]  news is huge the China news is huge the Kissinger Builderburg group news is
[12:25.960 --> 12:30.920]  huge prominent Swiss politician the equivalent of a congressperson calls
[12:30.920 --> 12:36.880]  for a rest of Kissinger at Builderburg we've got it all here but the biggest
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.000]  news and I've been telling you I've seen this in the cards we've gotten this
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.520]  from our FBI federal Marshall state police Intel sources you know we have
[12:46.520 --> 12:50.760]  those Intel sources in fact the Intel pours in so fast from confirmed sources
[12:50.760 --> 12:56.720]  I can't even cover it I can't even my head spinning I can't even call back all
[12:56.720 --> 12:59.880]  the prominent famous people that are calling me who want to come on the
[12:59.880 --> 13:05.560]  show I can't even there's a huge awakening happening 16 years ago when I
[13:05.560 --> 13:10.120]  got on air we were drinking knowledge out of a pixie straw you know the type
[13:10.120 --> 13:14.440]  that you stir your coffee with you suck as hard as you can you barely get in the
[13:14.440 --> 13:18.760]  info now I'm trying to drink out of a fire hose and I know you are as well a
[13:18.760 --> 13:23.720]  fire hose turned up on high and now a hundred more fire hoses are being shoved
[13:23.720 --> 13:28.400]  up in my face and your face and the amount of information it's just all out
[13:28.400 --> 13:32.360]  in the open the globalists are moving at warp speed there are times in history
[13:32.360 --> 13:36.120]  when more happens in a year than happened in the previous hundred
[13:36.120 --> 13:42.920]  Lenin said that many other corrupt globalist politicians dictators
[13:42.920 --> 13:47.040]  philosophers have pointed that out that we're in a liquid state right now the
[13:47.040 --> 13:52.840]  globalist have unfrozen societal cultural spiritual geopolitical economic
[13:52.840 --> 13:58.360]  systems that they'd already built and the old order is dying and the new order
[13:58.360 --> 14:03.000]  is being born I was reading the forward that Newt Yenrich wrote for Alvin and
[14:03.000 --> 14:10.040]  Heidi Toffler's third wave book last week and I meant to bring it in it's
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.000]  sitting there in my office at home I meant to bring it Thursday Friday and
[14:14.000 --> 14:18.680]  Sunday and didn't and I'd actually read some of their books years ago and and
[14:18.680 --> 14:21.720]  read some of the writings of Gennrich that's how I knew Gennrich was bad back
[14:21.720 --> 14:25.760]  in the mid 90s it was meant to lead Republicans into destruction so that we
[14:25.760 --> 14:29.320]  wouldn't get a real constitutional movement through that group and then
[14:29.320 --> 14:33.280]  everybody knows he's for carbon taxes and for global government and the rest of
[14:33.280 --> 14:37.320]  it or at least you should know that but I was reading what Gennrich wrote and
[14:37.320 --> 14:41.880]  what that book calls for how the old order has served the global elite well
[14:41.880 --> 14:46.120]  now it must be destroyed national sovereignty must be destroyed I mean
[14:46.120 --> 14:53.880]  this they write books Gennrich writes these things that's why he was chosen
[14:53.880 --> 14:58.080]  as a professor to then become a prominent member of Congress he's horrible
[14:58.080 --> 15:03.120]  and I have to hear mainline Republican talk show host endorsing him and talking
[15:03.120 --> 15:09.240]  about how great he is this is like saying Joseph Stalin was conservative I
[15:09.240 --> 15:14.400]  mean literally he he openly says destroy national sovereignty just like
[15:14.400 --> 15:18.040]  Strom Talbot who was the editor at Time Magazine before he went to work for
[15:18.040 --> 15:21.520]  Clinton or was it Newsweek saying we're gonna get rid of national sovereignty
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.760]  incrementally and you've got this new Obama appointee openly saying yeah the
[15:27.760 --> 15:33.400]  the cap and trade is a secret carbon tax well of course it is and I mean that's
[15:33.400 --> 15:40.480]  what's frustrating is this stuff is all out in the open and I mainly just
[15:40.480 --> 15:48.320]  marvel now that it's so naked I use those terms a lot naked brazen open
[15:48.320 --> 15:53.920]  uncloped in your face and a lot of people are waking up but there more
[15:53.920 --> 16:00.840]  should be waking up I mean every day I see articles where banks take homes they
[16:00.840 --> 16:05.000]  have no deed for that they never owned and never had a mortgage on and courts
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.320]  just take the houses and give it to them I mean that's criminal folks that's
[16:10.320 --> 16:15.720]  these these people are are unleashed they run almost every state government they
[16:15.720 --> 16:20.720]  run the federal government they run all the regulators they can do whatever they
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.800]  want and I've got that news today the good news is finally in Florida and
[16:26.800 --> 16:30.160]  they're gonna come after that judge but the answer is if other judges do the
[16:30.160 --> 16:34.000]  right thing together you have you have if other prominent people do the right
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.920]  thing Hollywood people government folks talk show host liberal conservative
[16:38.920 --> 16:42.080]  it's time to break your conditioning and get out of this controlled fake
[16:42.080 --> 16:46.280]  political spectrum we've been in and and for all of us to start telling the
[16:46.280 --> 16:51.640]  truth fully and going all the way or we don't have any future but this judge in
[16:51.640 --> 16:55.240]  Florida said yep you had five months you didn't have a deed to the house they
[16:55.240 --> 16:59.640]  paid cash you had no connection to it you took their house Bank of America you
[16:59.640 --> 17:02.680]  didn't pay them the hundreds of thousands of dollars back we're seizing
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.400]  your branch bank and sent the deputies in the constables in to take the cash out
[17:07.400 --> 17:12.320]  of the cat out of the till that's what they do to you when they come take your
[17:12.320 --> 17:17.920]  house and come take your belongings and and and Bank of America is how do you do
[17:17.920 --> 17:23.000]  this to us we're God we own part of the Federal Reserve we own you and the
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.200]  judges like no you don't they should all be clapping irons immediately they've
[17:27.200 --> 17:31.760]  all committed crimes openly this could end if we just wake up from the trance
[17:31.760 --> 17:37.800]  and then police people are gonna bring you coffee again and pie again I mean I've
[17:37.800 --> 17:41.720]  talked to my family I've talked people lived all over the country 30 40 50 years
[17:41.720 --> 17:45.280]  ago the average cops weren't corrupt cops and we're in the local neighborhood
[17:45.280 --> 17:49.160]  everybody knew them they were friends and cops were in to going after criminals
[17:49.160 --> 17:53.600]  there were still some corrupt areas in Chicago and New York and Dallas get in
[17:53.600 --> 17:59.440]  special squads who over time got bought off but but that corruption is tame
[17:59.440 --> 18:03.480]  compared to all over the country I see reports every week now Texas Tennessee
[18:03.480 --> 18:10.040]  New York Michigan California Florida New Mexico where cops just pull you over
[18:10.040 --> 18:14.440]  including old ladies people that have no criminal record and the old ladies got
[18:14.440 --> 18:18.920]  $2,000 in their purse the cops searches it without a warrant and takes it and
[18:18.920 --> 18:25.440]  says prove it's not drug money I remember 15 16 years ago watching 60
[18:25.440 --> 18:31.000]  minutes where a guy was flying from South Carolina to Houston every year and
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.840]  he paid a down payment and cash and the rest by check later once the 18 wheelers
[18:36.840 --> 18:43.600]  showed up with all of his crepe myrtle trees grown in Texas and he paid and
[18:43.600 --> 18:46.600]  cash for the ticket and it turned out the ticket clerks make more money a lot
[18:46.600 --> 18:52.080]  of times off off tattletale fees then they make off their yearly
[18:52.080 --> 18:55.960]  salary and it turned out the one woman that did it to this guy made over a
[18:55.960 --> 19:00.680]  hundred grand a year from air marshals and they just took took the guy's money
[19:00.680 --> 19:06.880]  was something like $20,000 that's been going on forever I mean you can't do
[19:06.880 --> 19:12.240]  that you can't behave like that's tyranny alright I'm ranting because I
[19:12.240 --> 19:14.720]  you know I talk about how I'm overwhelmed I mean that's just opening up my
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.280]  mind and all the things I'm looking at upset about I'll go back to last year
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.920]  Bloomberg and AP I keep repeating this because it's got no attention

[19:30.640 --> 19:36.760]  death benefits from World War two vets through to today they take money out of
[19:36.760 --> 19:40.760]  your check in the military put it in an insurance fund and now when your husband

[24:30.920 --> 24:34.360]  got Jim Tucker coming up at the start of the next hour I'm gonna get into this
[24:34.360 --> 24:46.400]  top story in a lot more detailed but it is so chilling to know that police
[24:46.400 --> 24:53.400]  according to emergency managers FBI federal marshals state police and since
[24:53.400 --> 24:57.520]  then since we were sent secret information years ago not just my act and
[24:57.520 --> 25:00.000]  Homeland Security reports and others dealing with the fact that the whole
[25:00.000 --> 25:06.720]  system is for gun owners libertarians landowners patriots in the Fedders Ron
[25:06.720 --> 25:12.480]  you know a constitutionalist that the entire system is for the American
[25:12.480 --> 25:18.560]  people not for the boogeyman al-CIA now it's admitted bin Laden was CIA and he
[25:18.560 --> 25:23.360]  always was and still is up until his death from kidney failure back in to
[25:23.360 --> 25:31.920]  2001 and notice Adam Godin grandson of the former head of the ADL I mean you
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.560]  really believe al-Qaeda is following a overweight Jewish kid from from San
[25:37.560 --> 25:44.400]  Diego who uploads videos with the al-Qaeda logo in the same layer as the
[25:44.400 --> 25:50.520]  Intel Center see this propaganda is all tailored at a mindless level for just the
[25:50.520 --> 25:53.360]  general public to kind of in the background while they're cooking dinner
[25:53.360 --> 25:57.880]  here al-Qaeda is planning to strike and all of our law enforcement sources
[25:57.880 --> 26:02.720]  before it later leaked out in the news showing my sources were accurate said
[26:02.720 --> 26:08.360]  we're being trained that gun owning militias are going to attack with al-Qaeda
[26:08.360 --> 26:13.160]  at shopping malls and kill everybody and we saw the beta test in Mumbai a few
[26:13.160 --> 26:19.400]  years ago came out in the time in India their enemies with Pakistan that it was
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.680]  not Pakistan that did it but that it was US and Israeli intelligence I mean
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.040]  that was in the times of India the head of Indian intelligence went public and
[26:28.040 --> 26:34.000]  then got killed right after he talked about it this is dangerous stuff and so
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.840]  they want to target shopping malls and other public places so they can then
[26:38.840 --> 26:43.720]  roll out TSA on the streets of America now what's frightening is suddenly
[26:43.720 --> 26:49.000]  there's a full court press we're going to cover this more in the next hour saying
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.280]  that al-Qaeda is going to hit the shopping malls they're going to hit the
[26:53.280 --> 26:57.000]  grocery stores and so see now right after the government announces they want
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.640]  naked-body scanners at all the shopping malls magically al-Qaeda comes out in
[27:00.640 --> 27:10.280]  agrees and says hi I'm Adam Gadan formerly Adam Perlman and I I'm the
[27:10.280 --> 27:15.960]  grandson of the ADL head and al-Qaeda follows me oh yes I mean al-Qaeda
[27:15.960 --> 27:19.960]  supposedly hates Israel trust nothing Israel does it wants to destroy Israel
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.440]  but oh their leader is Jewish the leader of al-Qaeda is Jewish they're now
[27:25.440 --> 27:29.520]  debating whether Gadan's number one or whether it's and we're all a lucky oh
[27:29.520 --> 27:32.560]  wait he's hanging out secretly with the secretary of the army at the Pentagon
[27:32.560 --> 27:37.560]  Fox News AP oh wait they run the underwear bomber on Christmas day oh
[27:37.560 --> 27:41.360]  God on the airplane by the US government undersecretary of state had to admit it
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.240]  months after we broke it with Kurt Haskell eyewitness I mean but again that's
[27:46.240 --> 27:51.080]  all tailored for the general public kind of cooking dinner making sloppy joes or
[27:51.080 --> 27:54.560]  whatever while the kids are playing video games and mama's got the TV on in
[27:54.560 --> 27:58.560]  the kitchen and oh my gosh there's that mean al-Qaeda guy he says he's you know
[27:58.560 --> 28:04.240]  al-Qaeda use the gun shows Americans are stupid they have gun shows and you can
[28:04.240 --> 28:08.520]  go right in and get guns and then go kill everyone and the meanwhile Obama's
[28:08.520 --> 28:12.800]  like see I told you we got to shut down those gun shows and ban semi-automatic
[28:12.800 --> 28:16.560]  rifles because al-Qaeda says they're gonna use it and ABC News says al-Qaeda
[28:16.560 --> 28:21.320]  found a weak spot our lacks gun laws they're gonna hit us and well I love the
[28:21.320 --> 28:26.720]  second amendment but al-Qaeda fighting al-Qaeda comes first turn my guns in I
[28:26.720 --> 28:32.160]  mean direct democratic talking point right as Obama gets ready to unveil his
[28:32.160 --> 28:36.080]  anti-gun agenda this month it's been announced weeks ago he would announce it
[28:36.080 --> 28:41.280]  in June quote under the radar that's what the memo says and here they are and
[28:41.280 --> 28:45.400]  al-Qaeda comes right out and al-Qaeda says thank you for releasing our fighters
[28:45.400 --> 28:49.280]  from Guantanamo Bay you make it so easy for us to attack you right as they're
[28:49.280 --> 28:53.240]  trying to set the precedent in courts to never give people trials including us
[28:53.240 --> 28:57.640]  citizens Gadan comes out and says thank you for releasing al-Qaeda that really
[28:57.640 --> 29:03.600]  helps us so they can say see al-Qaeda loves the fact that trials are being
[29:03.600 --> 29:07.440]  demanded and al-Qaeda says thanks for the second amendment we better get rid of
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.520]  trials and do process and the second amendment because Adam Gadan the Israeli
[29:12.520 --> 29:20.440]  operative says so in your face 100% and now he says attack attack and TSA says
[29:20.440 --> 29:24.080]  don't worry we're gonna protect you now now now coming up we're also gonna get
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.160]  into the incredible shootings on the border with Syria and Israel in the
[29:28.160 --> 29:33.160]  captured Golan area and the way our media is saying well that's Israel to the
[29:33.160 --> 29:37.280]  right thing well did Qaddafi you the right thing shooting protesters which
[29:37.280 --> 29:42.400]  turns out isn't even true see I mean it's hypocrisy either way you slice it

[34:16.880 --> 34:21.200]  American Union meeting in 2006 WikiLeaks has now released that confirming
[34:21.200 --> 34:24.840]  well the documents we got through judicial watch that they plan the secret
[34:24.840 --> 34:31.840]  merger of the North American Union already in place with the EU and Jim is
[34:31.840 --> 34:36.920]  just an amazing individual he was a news and sports writer back in the 50s and
[34:36.920 --> 34:43.320]  60s by the 70s he began to investigate Bilderberg group and for decades he was
[34:43.320 --> 34:47.720]  called a lunatic by the media they said it didn't exist that he was delusional
[34:47.720 --> 34:51.080]  just three years ago New York Times said that they said Jones was at the
[34:51.080 --> 34:58.640]  Marriott in Virginia believing that there were elites there when there weren't
[34:58.640 --> 35:02.360]  so they still try that some as well thinking their readers are abject
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.920]  morons now the reason this is so important is Jim Tucker has gotten
[35:07.920 --> 35:14.960]  scores more than 20 that I can list pieces of intel years before it becomes
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.480]  mainstream news of exactly what the globalist are going to do the fall of
[35:18.480 --> 35:22.440]  Berlin Wall the ouster of Margaret Thatcher Bush to endorse carbon taxes and
[35:22.440 --> 35:27.000]  then he did it and people were shocked on and on and on and on and he has Intel
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.680]  the only person who actually has Intel directly in Bilderberg American free
[35:31.680 --> 35:35.000]  press net is where he can read his reportage and you can also subscribe
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.640]  there Jim thank you so much for joining us what new Intel do you have I know you
[35:39.640 --> 35:43.760]  usually get a lot about their agenda before you go what is the latest Intel
[35:43.760 --> 35:50.240]  Jim Tucker still pretty much unchanged for our last conversation they are of
[35:50.240 --> 35:59.800]  course determined to keep the recession going through the year 2012 or whatever
[35:59.800 --> 36:04.880]  reason that serves their purposes and it's by the fact that old price going down
[36:04.880 --> 36:09.880]  they're trying hard to force them back up they won't America's place so the
[36:09.880 --> 36:14.400]  dollars a gallon for gasoline they've never quite gotten that far but they're
[36:14.400 --> 36:23.640]  working at it and more good news from our patriots have been told since our
[36:23.640 --> 36:27.920]  last conversation Bilderberg and Satter who's been very reliable for more than
[36:27.920 --> 36:35.120]  20 years that they're growling and complaining about these dirty curries
[36:35.120 --> 36:41.400]  you me and all the patriots around the country who object to the Bilderberg
[36:41.400 --> 36:55.880]  playing playing God they're simply outraged so and they're telling us to
[36:55.880 --> 37:05.360]  that there that Obama is their good friend and he had to disregard the war
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.760]  power fact so we could keep the poor going in Libya which they want to as you
[37:09.760 --> 37:17.880]  know want to use a spark bug to light up the entire Middle East so they
[37:17.880 --> 37:25.120]  forgive him for that understand why he has to do it now specifically Jim let's
[37:25.120 --> 37:30.000]  go back to 2007 and I went and looked it up it wasn't just Lindsey Williams that
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.120]  said he had sources and now we know Ken from was one of them since he deceased
[37:34.120 --> 37:37.920]  the former head of Atlantic Richfield that they wanted to break our back
[37:37.920 --> 37:43.600]  financially by raising oil to 150 you got that out of Bilderberg a year later
[37:43.600 --> 37:49.000]  it happened then in 2008 you said folks aren't consuming like they thought they
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.360]  would they're gonna lower it again and it that indeed happened what are you
[37:54.360 --> 37:58.560]  getting on the energy front about what they're planning to do with the
[37:58.560 --> 38:09.320]  devaluation of the dollar oh they're they've been a cheerleaders far nuclear
[38:09.320 --> 38:15.880]  power plants since the late 1990s they discovered that's a great source of
[38:15.880 --> 38:21.680]  it of wealth farther but you build nuclear plants you're giving contracts to
[38:21.680 --> 38:28.440]  big companies throughout the world of which they own great portion and they
[38:28.440 --> 38:34.000]  make great profits so they're very discouraged that their host state of
[38:34.000 --> 38:38.320]  Switzerland has decided it's going to get out of the nuclear power business I
[38:38.320 --> 38:46.400]  think Finland said it would too and also they're very concerned about the
[38:46.400 --> 38:53.920]  euro going down and maybe the they're even afraid the euro will simply
[38:53.920 --> 39:02.640]  disappear because what do you get countries like Switzerland a peaceful
[39:02.640 --> 39:08.960]  country where you require their own a gun opposed they're getting out of the
[39:08.960 --> 39:13.320]  nuclear power business along with the two or three other countries it's very
[39:13.320 --> 39:19.560]  unpopular in Germany and in fact the Prime Minister Merkel I think it's a
[39:19.560 --> 39:25.440]  while going wobbly on nuclear power which he's strongly advocated and that's
[39:25.440 --> 39:33.800]  very distressed to them but the more they grieve the more we we enjoy it Jim
[39:33.800 --> 39:38.200]  going back to your source you have multiple of course but one the inside
[39:38.200 --> 39:44.640]  Bilderberg particularly high up more detailed because from what I'm getting
[39:44.640 --> 39:49.360]  but I want to put words in your mouth are they panicked are they routed are
[39:49.360 --> 39:54.760]  they in trouble you say they're upset about the anti-globalist movement
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.600]  yourself myself did they say that specifically flesh out as much as you
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.600]  can for us now the state of their new world order because from what you've
[40:03.600 --> 40:06.720]  just said it sounds like things aren't going too well for them
[40:06.720 --> 40:10.960]  that's true things have been going badly for the last several years and for
[40:10.960 --> 40:17.040]  the last several years we've had been quoting them as saying that those
[40:17.040 --> 40:21.920]  dirty dirties on the sidewalks those primitives well they use a lot of
[40:21.920 --> 40:25.680]  expertise that you could not use in polite society but they're simply
[40:25.680 --> 40:30.360]  outraged to find that they have protesters outside they've always
[40:30.360 --> 40:36.000]  wanted their meetings to be secret with no knowledge of them whatsoever now all
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.880]  these years they've had to see people outside screaming at them and protesting
[40:39.880 --> 40:46.320]  their their meeting so that's got them very outraged in fact they're reading
[40:46.320 --> 40:51.440]  about it in the European press even now Americans are reading about American
[40:51.440 --> 40:57.320]  pre-pressive hearing about it from you in Europe a lot of major newspapers the
[40:57.320 --> 41:02.320]  Guardian of London and others have jumped into the ballpark and are telling
[41:02.320 --> 41:08.320]  their readers put in wear on Bilderberg and raise the same kind of questions we
[41:08.320 --> 41:14.120]  did so so their hoax of saying it didn't exist in your 35 years of coverage
[41:14.120 --> 41:18.200]  what was it six seven years ago that the dam started to break and we started to
[41:18.200 --> 41:22.120]  see big mainline press coverage like we're seeing now in the Guardian and
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.160]  other big papers of what they're doing in secret when did the dam really start
[41:26.160 --> 41:32.800]  to break on their on their cover-up let me stretch down here and pull out a
[41:32.800 --> 41:41.480]  note or two it goes back I'm sure to the 90s first time we saw protesters out by
[41:41.480 --> 41:53.880]  the gates he is getting his notes again Jim is a battle-hardened true journalist
[41:53.880 --> 42:07.280]  with the straw straw hat go go ahead Jim back up on it it goes back to actually
[42:07.280 --> 42:16.120]  to Portugal 88 in Austria where a few of the newspaper men came out and that was
[42:16.120 --> 42:28.040]  the 1988 in Austria and that was when the readers did so fashion all about long
[42:28.040 --> 42:33.520]  ago but that year we had the story of where and when so early as in something
[42:33.520 --> 42:39.120]  like November our readers across the sea in Europe they have to pay a tremendous
[42:39.120 --> 42:47.120]  price because the postage cost all that stuff but they had they do put it where
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.280]  on billaberg so readers with 200 miles or conference college said should we
[42:52.280 --> 42:57.800]  alert the local press should we tell our newspapers and broadcasts I said yes
[42:57.800 --> 43:03.880]  yes yes now we sit out a letter as you know every year urging readers within
[43:03.880 --> 43:07.920]  the area to do exactly that I should have thought about it much earlier than
[43:07.920 --> 43:13.040]  that but well Jim I understand the dam broke in the late 80s because of your
[43:13.040 --> 43:18.440]  decades of work in Europe but but even even seven eight years ago our media
[43:18.440 --> 43:22.920]  here in the US was still saying it didn't exist isn't that why one of the
[43:22.920 --> 43:27.960]  reasons the mainstream media is so discredited now well yes we start off with
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.720]  the control of so much of it for the Washington Post as you and I'm sure most
[43:32.720 --> 43:38.040]  of your listeners are aware it's controlled by billaberg they've attended
[43:38.040 --> 43:42.160]  the publishers attended every meeting since they first board met under the
[43:42.160 --> 43:49.440]  name billaberg in 1954 I mean they died the success of the grand family have
[43:49.440 --> 43:53.640]  always attended billaberg meetings along with publishers New York Times and
[43:53.640 --> 43:58.200]  Los Angeles Times now the Washington Post owns a hundred and seventy news
[43:58.200 --> 44:04.920]  papers wash most company big and small now they can not directly order all of
[44:04.920 --> 44:08.000]  their hundred seventy newspapers throughout the country to never use
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.440]  word billaberg no coverage whatsoever and they better follow orders they don't
[44:11.440 --> 44:16.040]  get they don't get fired well Jim here's an example at 2008 you and I were there
[44:16.040 --> 44:20.440]  we knew Obama and Hillary were inside the media the number one story in the
[44:20.440 --> 44:26.520]  country is where is Hillary and Obama hiding we called ABC CBS CNN Fox local
[44:26.520 --> 44:32.360]  papers none of them would come not even the local Virginia paper but the epoch
[44:32.360 --> 44:37.240]  times came and covered it so that shows the control that they're claiming they
[44:37.240 --> 44:41.080]  don't know where Obama and Hillary are the mystery meeting we're there we know
[44:41.080 --> 44:44.720]  they're there the Secret Service goes in the motorcades we're telling them and
[44:44.720 --> 44:50.480]  the media had such control that's how controlled us media is European is not
[44:50.480 --> 44:54.520]  that controlled now now Jim in our precious time with you other intel if
[44:54.520 --> 44:58.000]  they're upset about the alternative media you've talked about their moves to
[44:58.000 --> 45:02.200]  try to censor the press earlier we've seen the UN a month ago two weeks ago
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.400]  our own media calling to start censoring the internet to start internet
[45:06.400 --> 45:11.360]  taxes regulation do you have any intel on how they're planning to counter the
[45:11.360 --> 45:16.000]  internet and alternative press that's kicking their hind in
[45:17.000 --> 45:22.440]  well there has been some conversation about how to call up some of the
[45:22.440 --> 45:29.480]  newspapers that they don't control and oh that guy who bought up all those
[45:29.480 --> 45:33.960]  newspapers got in trouble owns most of the newspapers in the world they said
[45:33.960 --> 45:37.360]  he's still our good friend he's not allowed to burn beating anymore Zoros
[45:37.360 --> 45:42.680]  among them he's still our good friend though although for a political reason
[45:42.680 --> 45:48.560]  being a convicted T-line he cannot attend any more Zoros isn't allowed to
[45:48.560 --> 45:55.120]  attend no they're very precious they're very one of their founders lucky guy
[45:55.120 --> 45:58.880]  was about the founders billiards not be able to attend but he's still their good
[45:58.880 --> 46:03.480]  friend because the Lockheed scandal was back in the 1950s that was with Prince
[46:03.480 --> 46:07.280]  Bernhardt yeah for Prince Bernhardt right I was trying to remember okay now
[46:07.280 --> 46:10.560]  let's shift gears again in the time we've got we appreciate you Jim join us
[46:10.560 --> 46:15.800]  for American Free Press.net we're gonna have links here reported throughout the
[46:15.800 --> 46:19.960]  week at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com Jim specifically you talked
[46:19.960 --> 46:24.320]  about the spark plug Libya to ignite the Middle East it's now admitted that US
[46:24.320 --> 46:27.480]  and British troops are there been there the whole time they always meant to have
[46:27.480 --> 46:30.800]  a ground war of course they lied it's now admitted that they overthrew their
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.560]  old dictator Mubarak what is the larger strategy the stratagem the deceptive
[46:35.560 --> 46:40.800]  strategy why why what's the larger geopolitical reason to destabilize the
[46:40.800 --> 46:44.440]  Middle East and the central and southern Asia in Pakistan why are they
[46:44.440 --> 46:50.200]  wanting to do that what's the larger plan I'm still trying to hash that one out
[46:50.200 --> 46:56.080]  with these turkeys but we do know that they fit their interest well war
[46:56.080 --> 47:00.840]  profiteering is one of the obvious ones when you go to war you make big bucks and
[47:00.840 --> 47:09.520]  they're in the heavily invested in heavy industry they all are so that's why
[47:09.520 --> 47:14.800]  they were star wars that's why they star wars good thing really but they are
[47:14.800 --> 47:21.600]  their motivation with profit when you go to war you've got you make a lot of blood
[47:21.600 --> 47:30.480]  money so a big war in the Middle East which would be the rationale for
[47:30.480 --> 47:39.880]  fighting in the Iran on behalf of Israel it will be a huge profit and they're
[47:39.880 --> 47:47.440]  concerned now they won't they won't be a war to expand and the big and it
[47:47.440 --> 47:52.760]  claims the Middle East and it looks like that's gonna be tough with part of
[47:52.760 --> 47:58.200]  cause NATO is counting them so hard and yet NATO is one of their tools for
[47:58.200 --> 48:03.800]  food okay I want to briefly get into you the the euro their receivership arm and
[48:03.800 --> 48:07.080]  so much trouble and and and this worldwide awakening to the private
[48:07.080 --> 48:10.720]  banking cartel but your article in American Free Press Texas Governor Perry
[48:10.720 --> 48:19.240]  Boulderburg ace in the hole we talked to you in Greece at the time in 2008 and
[48:19.240 --> 48:25.320]  2007 and you said this looks like Perry is definitely going to be running for
[48:25.320 --> 48:28.760]  president soon just like Bill Clinton went there when he was unknown basically
[48:28.760 --> 48:33.120]  low-level member of parliament Tony Blair a few years before what does it
[48:33.120 --> 48:41.520]  signify having Rick Perry attend Builderburg well it makes him build a
[48:41.520 --> 48:45.440]  property as you know when you tend to build a bird beneath you take that
[48:45.440 --> 48:49.760]  note that you'll reveal nothing and you're supposed to follow orders like
[48:49.760 --> 48:57.280]  good boy and they all do we seem to back demonstration present George HW Bush
[48:57.280 --> 49:02.600]  campaign promising no new taxes read my lips he said he's in favor of the tax
[49:02.600 --> 49:07.160]  group Bill of Rights which had been first proposed by Liberty Lobby earlier
[49:07.160 --> 49:16.160]  and within the first year the White House he reversed himself and increased
[49:16.160 --> 49:24.800]  taxes and lost the election to Bill Clinton who of course intended Bill
[49:24.800 --> 49:30.720]  Berger a year one year before so there's a great price to pay if you
[49:30.720 --> 49:38.400]  disobey orders in HW disobeyed orders and paid the price of the White House so
[49:38.400 --> 49:41.840]  did Margaret Thatcher and you were able to report that before she was forced
[49:41.840 --> 49:47.120]  out we talked about hiding Hillary we had a lot of fun a few years ago that
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.560]  he was Lakeland near Georgia and the staff down there told us that Hillary
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.440]  Clinton is there they've seen her she's there for more than a day and she'd be
[49:57.440 --> 50:03.200]  there until Sunday morning or something so she was positively identified by
[50:03.200 --> 50:09.880]  several of their own staff members just excited about the first lady and get back
[50:09.880 --> 50:17.040]  to Washington I called the White House my first lady's press office and first
[50:17.040 --> 50:23.560]  ladies have their own big fat press staff and they said oh no she didn't attend
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.880]  such a meeting I said no no they said we don't know where she's being I said yes
[50:28.880 --> 50:33.760]  you do you know cap every moment of her day I said I'm prepared no shoes there
[50:33.760 --> 50:38.560]  I'm prepared to write positive shoes there but her staff did not know we'll call
[50:38.560 --> 50:42.080]  you right back I said you called me back in 15 minutes that's what I wrote which
[50:42.080 --> 50:48.040]  was not true but I have to file my story in 15 minutes as is or we can fix it they
[50:48.040 --> 50:52.600]  called back and officially acknowledged that Hillary had it as first lady had
[50:52.600 --> 50:58.160]  attended the Bilderberg meeting but they sure didn't like to acknowledge it Jim
[50:58.160 --> 51:03.440]  would you say that Bilderberg is beginning to run scared or is panicking or
[51:03.440 --> 51:08.000]  feels the world waking up to him as Brzezinski told the CFR last year that
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.920]  the world is waking up to the true elite and not their puppet front people like
[51:12.920 --> 51:18.520]  Obama and Bush I mean how would you quantify the state of this global
[51:18.520 --> 51:23.240]  imperium right now I would say there is all this nervous with this trumpet in
[51:23.240 --> 51:31.560]  church now Jim we've only got a few minutes left with you do you have any
[51:31.560 --> 51:37.800]  intel on some of the minions governors members of parliament members of the
[51:37.800 --> 51:42.440]  Senate that are going to be there under Bilderberg examination you know in the
[51:42.440 --> 51:46.760]  past it was Bill Clinton it was you know other people that became president
[51:46.760 --> 51:52.920]  any word on the agenda of some of the things that that they're going to be
[51:52.920 --> 51:57.600]  focusing on any other areas you haven't covered
[51:57.600 --> 52:09.480]  I'll tell you my mind is a little bit bone-causing stupid cab driver that they all fit the wrong spot I've been here early and rested with over my nose I've been sweating like a
[52:09.480 --> 52:15.680]  Negro election day in Mississippi in breakfast from where the cab recovered where
[52:15.680 --> 52:21.840]  the cab dropped me off at the wrong place like this punch in Washington of course
[52:21.840 --> 52:25.560]  folks wouldn't know that old Georgian saying get back when the racist would go
[52:25.560 --> 52:30.160]  after black folks for trying to trying to vote and would try to try to keep
[52:30.160 --> 52:34.280]  them from their voting rights now the system just has their electronic voting
[52:34.280 --> 52:39.600]  machines well Jim I understand that you are a bit winded but you're gonna be
[52:39.600 --> 52:44.840]  getting in I guess Wednesday morning or so into Switzerland tell us about this
[52:44.840 --> 52:50.080]  location have they ever met there before no they've met in I think four
[52:50.080 --> 52:54.760]  times before but never in the same place twice and rarely do they meet in the
[52:54.760 --> 53:01.400]  same place twice at least 20 years ago by the same rich rich is a resort
[53:01.400 --> 53:08.640]  community not not very big to get there I find a Zurich take a three-hour train
[53:08.640 --> 53:15.880]  ride from Zurich Sweden to Mauritsa Switzerland now the intel I've gotten is
[53:15.880 --> 53:19.680]  there they're going to this remote area where it's also very expensive
[53:19.680 --> 53:22.040]  Switzerland the most expensive place in the world for those that don't know
[53:22.040 --> 53:26.240]  other than maybe Tokyo but the country itself are expensive because they're
[53:26.240 --> 53:30.480]  very angry you said a few years ago a quote was the we've got to implode the
[53:30.480 --> 53:36.200]  economy so folks are so poor they don't have money to travel and protest us yes
[53:36.200 --> 53:42.840]  that's their broad program is to bring up to level the world economically that
[53:42.840 --> 53:50.160]  is not raising the backward countries up to our level but bringing us down to
[53:50.160 --> 53:59.200]  their level so the entire world is in a poverty level type of economy the more
[53:59.200 --> 54:06.960]  easy to control and of course the billberg kids themselves will never run
[54:06.960 --> 54:14.880]  out of ice cream they'll live the same luxurious life they've already always
[54:14.880 --> 54:23.040]  lived but part you and me and the general population they they won't the
[54:23.040 --> 54:29.200]  American Center of living to go down so that that's part of the $7 Gala gas
[54:29.200 --> 54:36.160]  being Gala gas being told that they said it helped that along and these food
[54:36.160 --> 54:41.120]  shortages of course will help that along Jim just two final questions in one
[54:41.120 --> 54:46.800]  point a after you get a chance to take a break because I know you got dropped off
[54:46.800 --> 54:51.680]  far away from the newspaper and had to hike it but please stand by for Aaron
[54:51.680 --> 54:55.000]  Dykes who's going to be on the phone obviously working with you and
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.640]  conferring with you when you're in Switzerland he'd like to talk to you
[54:58.640 --> 55:02.240]  about some of those interviews we're doing later in the week to line those

[55:24.160 --> 55:28.160]  do appreciate you spending time with us and how many years has it been is it
[55:28.160 --> 55:38.760]  35 now or 36 that you've been covering build a bar 35 or 36 we go back to 1939
[55:38.760 --> 55:43.040]  where I should start traveling something like that but directing the coverage
[55:43.040 --> 55:51.000]  by the reporters since 1975 well in closing and I'll let you go folksy to
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.200]  talk to you Jim you brought up their concern about the collapse of the Euro
[55:55.200 --> 55:58.920]  have they been too good at what they're doing because it has their own documents
[55:58.920 --> 56:02.280]  World Bank IMF show they are getting everybody in debt creating derivatives
[56:02.280 --> 56:06.520]  by design so they can take over the world but have they gotten too good at
[56:06.520 --> 56:12.000]  destroying economies to consolidate them you know this plan destruction command
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.040]  destruction because now you talk about Europe that they meant to continue to
[56:16.040 --> 56:21.840]  expand and merge with other unions as their UN plan states now it is
[56:21.840 --> 56:27.280]  tottering and and the dollar that they control is tottering and more and more
[56:27.280 --> 56:33.720]  experts are saying Europe the Euro may collapse so specifically any more
[56:33.720 --> 56:38.240]  details deliver kids themselves last few years it talks about how they're
[56:38.240 --> 56:43.520]  afraid to the euro of course they want to preserve the euro and introduced as
[56:43.520 --> 56:49.080]  you pointed out the North American Union or the American Union and the
[56:49.080 --> 56:56.040]  dollarization of our of the Western hemisphere they've been freezing over
[56:56.040 --> 57:01.680]  their overreach on the economy which is dangerous the euro which they want to
[57:01.680 --> 57:08.480]  preserve what is the prognosis from your source inside I mean are they
[57:08.480 --> 57:12.840]  thinking it's gonna collapse are they trying to prop it up right now they're
[57:12.840 --> 57:17.960]  afraid that it will collapse there they won't take some action to avoid it but
[57:17.960 --> 57:21.760]  they're afraid of the collapse the euro are simply too many countries pulling
[57:21.760 --> 57:28.440]  out they've never used the euro we have countries if I've mentioned before like
[57:28.440 --> 57:35.400]  Switzerland said they're not use the euro several other countries in Europe
[57:35.400 --> 57:40.560]  refused to use the euro use their own well Switzerland I'll be bringing
[57:40.560 --> 57:48.240]  darkness to Switzerland and Sweden does not use the euro cause I've got some
[57:48.240 --> 57:55.360]  of the kind of currency in case I need it my brief layover in Sweden so they
[57:55.360 --> 58:04.240]  always refused it and that is bill berg knickers in a knot so bottom line how's
[58:04.240 --> 58:08.840]  it in closing how's David Rockefeller doing he's still quite frail in the
[58:08.840 --> 58:16.320]  way wheelchair at 96 years old he's a I don't think he has been in bill berg
[58:16.320 --> 58:21.480]  beneath left well you've got about 20 left in you how many how many of these

[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.960]  want to spend some time and we come back from break here this little short
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.160]  segment why we do this little five-minute segment but some stations
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:08.040]  don't want to carry the news and so years ago now 14 years ago on Genesis 14
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:13.520]  years ago wow time flies when I got on Genesis we decided to do this first
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.320]  five minutes in law stations to carry it but also then like to be careful when I
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.160]  come back at the next segment when everybody's listening you know to get
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:30.800]  into the most important information so we're gonna be getting into the 25 63
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.600]  no unsure incredible footage of crowds of peaceful demonstrators being mowed
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.080]  down and regardless of which side of the fence you're on or even if you're
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.640]  neutral with this whole tribal warfare situation between the Israelis and the
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:50.440]  Palestinians these were peaceful crowds and it is Syrian territory that was
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:55.240]  taken and to watch them being mowed down and then to watch our media you know
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:59.560]  act like it's the protesters fault while meanwhile saying we've got to invade
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:03.720]  all these countries and overthrow Egypt and overthrow Gaddafi and it's not a
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.680]  ground war but it is because Gaddafi might have shot some protesters it's
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.440]  it's incredible I mean you know the Chinese are bad for killing people at
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:20.480]  Tiananmen Square but Israel's good doing this it it you can't be a sane person I
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.440]  mean if you embrace what Israel's done you've got to embrace China run over
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.200]  people with tanks and shoot them in Tiananmen Square you've got to embrace
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.680]  Gaddafi what he's been accused of you've got to embrace Saddam Hussein I mean in
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.960]  every society mowing down peaceful people I mean they could have shot them
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:40.800]  with water cannons they could have arrested them no they just shot them can
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.000]  you imagine if the illegal aliens coming across the border many of which
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.360]  have guns and an are violent were mowed down like that what the media would do I
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:53.280]  mean I'm not for open borders and I'm against you know the horde of illegal
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:01.640]  aliens pouring in and waving Mexican flags but I would decry and try to
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.800]  go protect them if our troops were just shooting them I mean including
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.800]  teenagers and people just mowing them down and I've heard our media going
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.120]  good kill them they're Arabs I mean we've dehumanized these Arabs in this
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.600]  country and it's wrong and I you know I try to stay out of the whole Israel thing
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.840]  because it's a big tar baby it's never gonna stop it just goes on and on and
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.800]  on and I know that all cultures have corruption problems you know it's not
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.320]  that I'm anti-Israel or that I'm anti-Germany or anti-China or anti-Russia
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.280]  anti-America corrupt governments run all these countries and Israel does
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:44.880]  horrible evil things but I don't have like some you know hatred it's more
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:50.320]  just scientific looking at it and in Israel's a tyranny and Israel's involved
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:54.080]  in our internal politics and I don't like it and so I'm gonna break it down on
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.280]  the other side just you cold hard facts straight ahead we'll get into Adam

[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:45.080]  George Washington said we shouldn't be involved in foreign entanglements well
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:49.480]  I'm an American taxpayer and at least three billion dollars a year of my
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.000]  money goes to Israel three billion goes to Egypt billions here billions there
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.360]  and then there's all the military aid on top of it and I'm tired of it my
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:05.520]  government isn't my government it's run by the Bilderberg group 125 of the
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:11.960]  owners and CEOs and leaders of the fortune 100 and we get their minutes we
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.440]  get their documents here and there they want tyranny they want a police state
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:21.160]  they want a world government and Israel is basically a Western outpost to
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:28.480]  project power into the region you know I don't have a fetish for bashing Israel
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.240]  and I've noticed that people that go after Israel a lot of them tend to be
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:39.680]  very vitriolic themselves and make up a lot of stuff and be very vicious and
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:50.000]  not be reasonable and to be part of their own hate cult see people are trained
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.920]  to think either you're for this group or you're against this group or you're
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.320]  either for the Republicans or against the Republicans or either for the
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:00.520]  Democrats or against the Democrats no I don't want any of it it's all basically
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:08.160]  going in the same direction and I think because in the last 16 years I was
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.480]  somewhat ignorant about all the details of Israel 16 years ago and I had more of
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.080]  a pro-Israel stance at that time just because I was brought up a conservative
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.080]  brought up you know mainline Christian and you're taught Israel's ganged up on
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.160]  they're the little guy you've got to you know support them I mean that was just
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:31.800]  not even so much for my parents though they were never anti-Israel but just the
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:37.920]  culture I grew up in in Dallas and you are a product of where you come from and
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:43.920]  then over the years I've been attacked by people who've lied about me and done
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.720]  stalker stuff and made stuff up I'd say about 99% of its false you know claiming
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:53.440]  I work for Israel and things like that and those people a lot of them I think
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.160]  are government operatives and it's been proven a lot of them are like Hal Turner
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.920]  and others but others are just mentally ill and they're so mentally ill that when
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:06.040]  I say that they put out articles saying Alex Jones says if you don't worship
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:14.680]  Israel you're mentally ill no I said if you say I work for Israel that you are
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.560]  mentally ill they go see he said you're mentally ill if you don't worship
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:25.880]  Israel that's not what I said so the system almost tries to force you into a
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:34.120]  position you either strap on a Nazi armband wear a Palestinian headdress or
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:43.760]  you join Israel and see I don't want to join Israel and I don't want to join the
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.440]  groups that literally save you fall on a banana peel that Israel did it I mean
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.200]  there are folks out there saying that Israel blew up Fukushima or when
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.680]  there's an earthquake Israel did it I mean you know my issue is governments
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.400]  are corrupt China's corrupt the US government the German government the
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.880]  Russian government that's the nature that's history that's what the founders
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:11.160]  taught it's what philosophy shows it's what Plato wrote about the Greeks were
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.200]  corrupt so were their enemies the Persians I'm not for the Persians I'm
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.720]  not for the Greeks I understand human nature and so people want to make things
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:30.640]  so simplistic but looking at Israel studying what Israel does because Israel
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:36.360]  has been given so much unconditional support it's like a you know a teenager
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.720]  you let do whatever they want here have the house have the car have all the
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.840]  money do whatever you want I mean those kids generally are gonna go to hell in
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.560]  a handbasket so so looking at Israel from that perspective Israel has been
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:55.560]  given such a long leash that Israel does whatever it wants whenever it wants and
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:03.840]  more and more I get angry at Israel because I want to be left alone I want
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.280]  to be an American I want my sovereignty and I see the Israeli lobby in this
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.920]  country always at the forefront of trying to push open borders and in
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:18.720]  globalism always at the forefront of the ADL and others demonizing anybody that
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:23.000]  doesn't want the banks to take over called banker bailout I see the Israeli
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.920]  lobby I mean they have meetings here in Austin every month the ADL pushing to
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.560]  restrict the Second Amendment and in the ADL in Middle East it basically
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:35.720]  Israeli intelligence look I don't like Russian spies in America I don't like
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:39.200]  British spies in America I don't like Israeli spies in America but let me tell
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.720]  you the Russians and the British and others can't get away with stuff like
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:49.800]  this my grandfather's both of them you know signed up for World War two my
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:54.440]  dad's dad flew B-17s over Europe and barely survived never even talked about
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.680]  it's life he was dead we got it all out of his trunk all the metals and the
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.320]  rest of it and then this guilt for what for Nazi Germany has somehow been
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.440]  placed on America where if you don't do whatever Israel says or does you committed
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.280]  the Holocaust if you're for the Second Amendment or you want to abolish the
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.560]  Federal Reserve you hate Jews well and and it's always injected in there I
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:24.240]  just want my freedom I just want my Second Amendment and you look at the
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.680]  Israeli lobby Chuck E. Schumer and and and Rahm Emanuel whose daddy was you
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:34.800]  know eargun and and and and he's part of the Israeli Defense Forces here in
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.280]  America coming and saying they want to take my guns away and have a no-gun
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:46.920]  by list if they put me on a list that that Israel is advising TSA on how to
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.920]  set up domestic checkpoints and police departments it's all over the news I
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:57.720]  mean get out of my life get get off my back stop pushing stop doing what
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:06.920]  you're doing and and then it's shameful to to see this footage and we'll play
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.600]  some of the prison planet TV viewers in the background while I'm talking about
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.440]  it of hundreds of peaceful protesters with their Syrian flags on what was
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:32.480]  Syria being mowed down being shot and they're being killed and it's it's
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.800]  happening in front of everyone and as I said on prison planet TV in the
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:44.840]  background we'll roll some of that video not the audio but I don't like the
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.280]  communist Chinese leadership and I remember back under Clinton if you
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.240]  criticize the communist Chinese and their spies and our government and the
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.880]  missile secrets CNN would say people don't like what China is doing because
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:01.440]  they're anti-Asian oh you don't like Obama's health care your anti health
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:07.760]  care or your anti-black what does that have to do with it it's dishonest it's
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.800]  a label so I don't like Tiananmen Square and tanks running over people and
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.080]  people being shot I don't like watching the Mexican government a few years ago
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.960]  shoot peaceful protesters and I got angry about it not because I hate Mexicans
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:26.480]  because I hate their government and it's the same thing with Israel I don't have
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:32.280]  some beef with Jewish people I know Jewish people are diverse I don't like
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:37.200]  the Nazis and people you know that say Jews are inherently evil or groups that
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:42.880]  say black groups that say whites are inherently evil but at the same time
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:50.440]  then by setting Israel up as infallible and can do no wrong we allow Israel to
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:55.320]  engage in espionage inside the United States to manipulate our politics and
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:00.720]  to now get to the point of peaceful protesters coming across and not water
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:07.640]  canning them not arresting them but shooting them killing upwards of 63
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:14.360]  and injuring hundreds and even as they left Israel continued to shoot them it's
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:20.640]  being reported I mean this is Tiananmen Square this is Israel said they didn't
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.680]  shoot people when they came down on board the flotilla but the evidence showed
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.600]  they did well what do you think's going on right here I mean this is in plain
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:34.120]  broad daylight people say well it's an Assyrian stunt whatever it used to be
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:41.280]  Syrian land those people have a lot of courage to march up unarmed and then to
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:48.080]  be shot I want the Syrians to live in peace I want the Israelis to live in
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:54.560]  peace but it's a political football of tribal warfare that is a big money sink
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.280]  that is never going to go away the Israelis aren't gonna go anywhere they
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:04.640]  got 400 nicks the Arabs aren't gonna go anywhere and this whole thing is going
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:11.920]  like a freight train towards World War 3 and I don't want World War 3 also the
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:24.600]  West is involved in the Arab Spring overthrowing think about this overthrowing
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:30.200]  a 31-year dictator who tortured people for Israel and the US who did anything he
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.880]  was told Hussein Mubarak and then they say oh my gosh they shot at some
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:40.040]  protesters stepped down Mubarak you shot and killed two protesters that was the
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.680]  first event two people Israel shoots and kills 63 and we're told this is
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.680]  wonderful the protesters asked for it State Department says protesters show
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.080]  restraint headlines violence on the border not massacre oh there's violence
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:19:01.040]  the it's it's the Syrians fault I can't live lies I can't see the Israeli lobby
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.720]  teamed up with the British European lobby in the US pushing for this war in
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.760]  Libya that they said wasn't a war and isn't a ground war and that would last
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.520]  two days not three months now they're saying it's gonna go into next year
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.800]  lies lies lies I can't watch Israel sit there and mow down hundreds of people
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:26.960]  killing 63 of them in cold blood and then see Hussein Mubarak their own
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.840]  minion who they betrayed that's what I mean there's no honor here even with
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.440]  their own dictators and then they tell you oh we got to go into Libya because he
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.360]  may have shot some protesters and it turns out that's not even true and he
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:43.640]  had rape gangs with Viagra that wasn't true but he went to Venezuela that was
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:49.920]  it true it's just total 1984 up is down down is up black as white ministry of

[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:08.160]  guaranteed here's the point I'm trying to get it dealing with Israel we are
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.000]  tribal creatures there's many go back thousands of
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.180]  years ago your tribe did stand for you and you had to protect yourselves of the
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:18.860]  other tribe would come and take your land kill your men and take your women
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:23.400]  and children as slaves if they wanted them that's been the universal rule of
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:30.720]  of human society. We just do it on more of a modern format today. And so my
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:37.560]  issue is, I don't apologize for criticizing Israel. I try to clarify
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.640]  because if you just hate Israel, that then feeds into this global
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.520]  Balkanization and division and dehumanizes the people in Israel, just
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:54.400]  like our media seeks to dehumanize the Palestinians. Okay? And so what I'm
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.680]  getting at here is that I don't like any of these governments. They're all
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:04.560]  corrupt. They're all evil. They're all grabbing for whatever power they can get.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.440]  You understand that? It's Israel's corrupt. The US government's corrupt. They're
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:15.720]  all corrupt. They're all lying. They all have powerful financial interests who
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:19.360]  are completely ruthless and competing with each other to set up a world
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.600]  government and to decide who's going to run that world government. But as a
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:30.280]  moral person, when you see an outrage like this, you must speak out against it.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:35.680]  When you see these people being mowed down, and this will only inflame more
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.200]  tensions. This will only, I mean, Israel's not stupid. They gave those
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:46.120]  soldiers those orders. That's admitted to mow those people down. It's just like
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:49.880]  the Jefferson Memorial with the police body slamming and choking people for
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:54.480]  silently dancing. That made 20 times more people show up this weekend. Now
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.440]  those parked police that body slammed them may lose their job. The Washington
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:05.560]  Post is reporting. So why would Israel mow down peaceful people, civilians? Why
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.440]  would they do something that they know will turn world attention against
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:17.720]  Israel? Well, if you look, the Israeli lobby is lockstep with MI6, European
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.680]  intelligence and US intelligence, fomenting rebellions all over the
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.480]  Middle East. Because the globalist want a powder keg in the Middle East. You
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.320]  heard Jim Tucker from his Bilderberg source. He doesn't know why the source
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.640]  didn't tell him why they want the Middle East to blow up. I'll tell you why,
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:40.240]  because they want to start what could lead to a giant regional conflict in
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.120]  gulfing Pakistan, India and China. They caught CIA people trying to sell and
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:50.480]  give uranium to al-Qaeda groups they control to then blame it on Pakistan
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:55.200]  to invade that country. The bankers have created a global meltdown. They need a
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.360]  new giant diversion, a new war, so big as Rand Corporation said two years ago.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:07.200]  And Paul Watson wrote about it. So big that everybody forgets about losing
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.480]  their house. People forget about the gas prices. People forget about the
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.080]  imploding economy and they rally around primitively around the government and
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.720]  then they can get through their carbon tax. They can get through their TSA on
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:26.200]  the streets. They can get through this entire system. And so I have to look out
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.760]  for my interest as an American. And the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, protects
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:36.520]  me as a hedge against tyranny. When you get rid of those checks and balances on
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.520]  government and corporations in every case in history, you get overrun and
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:46.160]  enslaved. And those checks and balances are being removed right now. And we've
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:52.840]  got Reuters articles here where the World Bank openly calls for a global tax
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:28:00.760]  to be paid to them on all carbon activities. World Bank to suggest CO2
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:05.320]  levy on jet shipping fuel. Then it goes on. You can read the full New World Bank
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.720]  report. They've been put down similar reports for more than 20 years, calling
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:17.200]  for total control paid to the private banks. The ones doing all of this. And I
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:23.000]  don't care if you're German, Jewish, Chinese, Mexican. You better get it
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.880]  through your head. 99.9% of us are gonna be hurt by this. The globalists are
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:34.320]  waging war against the real free market, against prosperity. They openly say in
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.040]  every one of their major reports they want a post-industrial world. They
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:42.480]  already own the world through fraud. They don't want you to be able to compete.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:45.360]  That's what the government health care is about. That's what the carbon tax is
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.640]  about. Giving waivers to insiders. Letting insiders build coal plants you
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:55.720]  can't. Letting insiders drill for oil but you can't. It's a managed economy going
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:00.280]  back to royalty where you had to get a letter, a license, an
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:04.440]  authorization. And by the way, first they give you licenses and give them to
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:08.720]  everybody. Then over time in every culture they phase out the licenses like in
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.160]  New York where they started licensing what 50 plus years ago for guns.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:17.840]  Everybody got one for a few bucks. Then they stop giving the licenses unless you
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.080]  paid off the politicians 30 grand. Unless you jumped through the hoops so all
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.480]  the mobsters can pay off the cops. They got guns but you don't. And it's the same
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.400]  thing. It's a global licensure. Now we come back under Paul Craig Roberts is
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:38.280]  coming up then because now I'm gotten behind. We'll get into Adam Gadan and the
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.720]  fact that they say Al Qaeda is gonna start shooting people everywhere so the
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.200]  government needs to go ahead and take your guns. This coinciding with Obama
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.840]  getting ready to announce his new gun control measure Al Qaeda comes in to
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:55.560]  agree with him and help. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:03.520]  and the GCN radio network. You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.200]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:11.040]  silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.320]  lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.480]  anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.800]  the silver lungs generator. Not only does the silver lung system produce endless
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:27.920]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:32.400]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:39.640]  key target areas. This includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:43.880]  and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new seven minute
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:50.200]  video tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:54.840]  about how the silver lung system works. As well we are always ready to answer
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:31:01.200]  any questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com. This is Alex Jones
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:04.520]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:08.760]  Number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.080]  bill. Number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:17.040]  electric company allows you to have. It's true total government control of
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:21.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three in
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:25.740]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:29.520]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:37.320]  families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five a solar
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:41.400]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.120]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:50.120]  Science. One of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:09.320]  place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens you'll be
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:16.600]  glad you were wearing diamond gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee where
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:25.920]  they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch guarantee you

[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:41.000]  need it most. Blue diamond gussets got it. Others don't. We turn jeans inside out.

[01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:03.240]  Others don't.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:21.800]  Well Dr. Webster Griffin Tarpley, General Hameen Gull, former head of
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:25.480]  Pakistani intelligence and countless others have broken down the geopolitical
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:29.520]  facts. There's an attempt to claim that the Pakistani government is working
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.440]  with Al Qaeda. CIA officer was trying to give him chemical, biological,
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:38.440]  radiological weapons over a month ago. That there's a move to try to
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:42.200]  destabilize that region and basically start World War III. The Iran
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.760]  Corporation close to three years ago, two and a half years ago, called for
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:52.160]  something even bigger than the Iran or Iraq war or the Afghan situation. Something
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:59.880]  bigger than just a single war to be able to smoke screen the global banking
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:05.080]  implosion that the IMF and World Bank openly hope to transform into this new
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.960]  bank of the world. You got the Euro plunging. All this is happening. That's
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.800]  when governments start wars. Well Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the former number two
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:18.080]  man, head of policy at the Department of Treasury, has got a new report out today.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:22.480]  How the Empire will prevail. The Washington Foment War between China and
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:28.120]  India. We'll be talking to him in one moment up on drudgerport.com on the
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:33.040]  right hand column. Prominent Swiss politician calls for arrest of Kissinger
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.520]  at Bilderberg Summit. That's the great reportage of Paul Joseph Watson at
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:44.080]  prisonplanet.com and we are going to be covering Bilderberg throughout this
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.760]  week. You also heard Jim Tucker earlier from his Bilderberg source. Bilderbergs
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:54.400]  are desperately struggling Bilderberg group meeting to try to save the Euro.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:35:00.920]  I know Watson's going to do another blurb on that very newsworthy information as
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.080]  some of the top most wealthy people in the world meet. Before we go to Dr.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.120]  Roberts, I also want to remind listeners that if you want to expose the
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.160]  private fellow-deserved banking cartel and its private shareholders, the new
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.640]  animated film, The American Dream, is available at infowars.com. It is your
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:23.200]  purchase of the books, the videos, the new Discover the Spirit of 1776 t-shirt
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:26.840]  that's my favorite. It is your purchase of the books, the videos, the materials
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.840]  that funds this operation. It is your support of the sponsors. But plus, and
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:36.440]  more importantly, it's double plus good to use an Orwellian term, all of the
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:39.800]  books, the films, the t-shirts, what do they do? They get the word out to the
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:44.480]  public. The public is ready to hear the truth now. The fact that I'm on the cover
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.600]  of Talkers Magazine that this weekend I am the keynote speaker in front of a
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:54.120]  thousand program directors, CEOs, and Limbaugh's been their keynote speaker.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.960]  Hannity's gonna be there. Why would I be the keynote speaker? Because a lot of
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.200]  people figured out there's no room for them in this new world order. They
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.840]  realize the stuff we talk about here is real, that our predictions are accurate,
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.400]  that we know what we're talking about. Truth is an idea whose time has come,
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:15.760]  okay? Okay, it's here, it's on. So Pete, the fields of minds are fertile to be
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:20.160]  awakened and unshackled. Infolwars.com to check out the online video, apparel

[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:49.600]  write to us, PO Box, 19-549, Austin, Texas, 787-60. So much is happening. I want to
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.600]  get into the geopolitical move to get a war started in Central and Southern
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.520]  Asia and the subcontinent. I want to get in with Dr. Roberts, Israel mowing down
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:03.240]  and killing, reportedly, 63 people in American TVs, like, good, they deserve it.
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.440]  But then we've got to attack Gaddafi because he might have killed a couple
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:09.560]  people and we got to overthrow Mubarak because he might have killed a couple. I
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.200]  mean, look, look, if you worship Israel, whatever, I've never tried to stay out
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:19.640]  of this tar baby because I just want my bill of rights, my constitution, my
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:24.440]  second, then my property rights. But give me a break, folks. I mean, Israel,
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.680]  all right, kill them Arabs, blow them away, they're peaceful, shoot them, kill
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:32.480]  them, shoot them when they run. Man, that's a manly, they're unarmed, trying to
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:38.040]  get their own property back, Southern Syria. But then, well, let's go to Dr.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:41.480]  Roberts, we'll get his take on that, as well. But we got to get that Gaddafi, he
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.080]  might have shot somebody. It isn't a ground war, they're just troops on the
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:49.600]  ground. I mean, we're entering 1984. Dr. Roberts, great to have you here with us
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.840]  today, sir, via video Skype. Thanks, Alex. Well, you just heard me ranting there.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:00.720]  I mean, I feel like I've woken up in 1984 squared, but your big article today,
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:06.200]  it's up on Prison Planet Info Wars and other great sites everywhere. What's
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:12.320]  your take on the attempt to start World War Three? Well, Alex, my column that's
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:18.320]  up today is speculative. I did it to get people thinking and watching the
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:24.720]  situation. And because the real unresolved problem for Washington is
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:31.720]  China. They don't really know what to do about China because it has risen very
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:42.040]  fast economically, and it's also rising fast militarily. But it also has the
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:47.600]  diplomatic advantage over the United States. It doesn't threaten people and
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:54.400]  bully them. It offers them cooperation, economic development,
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:01.200]  soft power. It's the soft power that we used to emphasize before the brown
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:10.600]  shirted Neoconservatives took over Washington. So the question is what
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:19.880]  will Washington do about China? The anxiety has worsened since Strascon,
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:25.160]  the former director of the IMF, issued the report recently that within five
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:31.200]  years, China would be the number one economic power in the world. And five
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:38.320]  years is not very long to plan for what to do about a rising power. And so
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:45.400]  I noticed certain things have been happening. One, we've been thawing all
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.920]  over India. We now we've had massive arms sales to them. We have these
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:58.040]  military corporation agreements and joint military exercises. And you have
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:06.000]  to wonder about that. You know, why is India related to America's strategic
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:15.280]  military interests? And we've seen recently, because of the alleged
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:19.520]  commando raid that killed bin Laden, that the United States has been
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:24.880]  increasing its pressure on Pakistan, threatening it. And we've seen the
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:31.920]  various reports that American military leaders believe we cannot prevail in
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:37.880]  Afghanistan unless we widen the war into Pakistan, because the Taliban have
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:43.400]  sanctuaries there and so on and so on. And lo and behold what happened, Pakistan
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:48.000]  has got the message and they ran off to China. And the Pakistani prime minister
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.720]  said that China was their best and most trusted friend. And the Chinese,
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:59.600]  according to the Indian press, it's all over the Indian press, called
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.760]  Washington and told Washington to leave Pakistan alone to respect its
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:10.360]  sovereignty and that China would regard any US military attack on Pakistan
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:17.160]  as an attack on China. Well, that is an amazing kind of ultimatum, not the
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:21.880]  kind we haven't seen since World War One or World War Two. And it shows a
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:27.840]  commitment of China to Pakistan. Well, this has to really upset the
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:34.760]  Indians to find that Pakistan they have differences with is now under the
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:40.960]  protection of China. And so I would expect that the Washington now sees a
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.400]  way to deal with China and that's to involve it in a war with India. And
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:50.400]  since they're both nuclear powers, there's a good chance that it would
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:57.360]  go nuclear. So most likely what Washington would do in this type of
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:04.560]  situation is to remove itself from contention with Pakistan and China and
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:13.160]  substitute India. And Washington seems to be very good at getting other
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:17.640]  people to do its dirty work, you know, witness Britain and France today in
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:22.600]  Libya. Yes, surrogates, kamikaze states. That's right. And NATO and
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:31.000]  Afghanistan. And so the ability of the Americans to purchase leaders and other
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.320]  governments or to manipulate them to lead them into doing Americans
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:41.920]  Washington's, I don't want to say America's Washington's will is proven.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:47.520]  And so I just drew a speculative conclusion. I don't know that this
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:53.360]  would happen. But well, sir, it's very clear the decision was made really in
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.880]  the last 10, 15 years consciously to shift from a free society to an
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:03.280]  authoritarian one. So these global interests that use America as its
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:08.560]  juggernaut are domestically clamping down as well. And I think the point you
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.760]  made that it's Washington, not America, America is drug kicking and
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:21.600]  streaming of the adult sitcom watching Prozac public, but also the 30, 40,
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.640]  50 million conservatively that really are awake, that are libertarian, that are
[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:29.520]  constitutionalist. The anti-war movement's been publicly taken over by the
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:36.120]  Ford Foundation. We are a captured state. And looking at that, that's why the U.S.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.100]  controllers are so arrogant, is we have the nuclear weapons, Israel has the
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:46.400]  nukes, Europe has nukes, England has nukes, but they are emboldened by
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:51.920]  feeding on defenseless third world states, kind of like Hitler attacking the
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:58.080]  old world Poland with their horse-drawn artillery. It was a joke, but at a
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.720]  certain point they do run into China. They do run into Russia, who I'm not
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:06.720]  saying are great guys and I've got a, you know, love affair with them, but you
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.360]  can't say China's bad mowing down people at Tiananmen Square of Israel's good
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.080]  mowing them down. I mean, I mean, at the end of the day, I'm just coldly as a
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:22.960]  political atheist looking, you know, at the lay of the land, or political real
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.680]  this is a better term, and it's clear in every case in history when the West
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:32.840]  begins to collapse, it starts a giant war, normally with itself. And you say
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:36.960]  you're speculating Dr. Tarpley, General Hamid Ghul, countless others who I
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:40.240]  really respect in my own analysis. I mean, they're clearly in there and
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:47.200]  they're selling the PR and the whole bin Laden fable to attack Pakistan. So it's,
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:54.480]  I guess, in a pincer with India in Kashmir and the US through Afghanistan
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:00.160]  and then out of the Gulf into there. I mean, any way you slice it, we know the
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:03.760]  West is foaming many of these rebellions that were already ready to go, but
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:09.680]  they triggered it in the Middle East. It's on. I mean, I clearly they're moving
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:15.920]  in to a very dangerous phase of geopolitical destabilization, I guess,
[01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:19.440]  is a political smoke screen for the collapsing economies.
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:27.160]  Well, it could be, but that assumes that they know that they're collapsing.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:34.960]  And that's not clear that they know that. Or it could, it could be a combination
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:40.120]  of things. I think probably one of the most important is the, is Washington's
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:48.000]  drive for hegemony over the world and the, and the neo-conservative drive for
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.520]  American hegemony. You know, it's like we said some years ago when this first
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:59.320]  appeared, the neo-conservatives or the new Jacobins, you know, the Jacobins of
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:03.320]  the French Revolution that wanted to spread the French Revolution to all of
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:08.440]  Europe. And so we had all the decades of the Napoleonic Wars and so on.
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:14.240]  So there are many reasons and they all could come together to support war.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:21.360]  But I think you're correct that war is on the agenda and it's where things
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.800]  were headed. In fact, it may be so much on the agenda that's out of control and
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:32.640]  it may be almost impossible, even if Washington wanted to, to pull back on it.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:38.680]  You see, the whole Libyan thing is about ejecting China from its oil
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:45.200]  investments in eastern Libya. The Syrian thing is about ejecting Russia from its
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:53.480]  Syrian naval base. Well, so it's gone already from beating up on Iraq and,
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:47:02.240]  and Yemen and, and, and Pakistan to confrontations, even if indirect under
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:06.840]  the cover of the Arab Spring, but there, there are confrontations between
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:12.200]  Washington and China and Washington and Russia and they affect both China and
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:18.360]  Russia's strategic interest. Sir, you just hit on something, obviously, being a
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:22.360]  big history buff because those that know history are not doomed to repeat it. If
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:27.480]  you look at Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his magic flute, that really made folks
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:32.680]  mad. He died pretty quick thereafter. But if you read about the Jacobins, they
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:38.640]  wanted what a nine-day work week. They wanted to change and get rid of the
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:46.240]  family. They wanted to abolish technology. They wanted to, to be, be God. And that
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:52.560]  was the Illuminati who was the precursor of that 1776 Ingolstadt University. And,
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.400]  and you tell the general public this, they just don't understand it. But you
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:59.080]  look at the communists that then came out of that, there's a direct historical
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:04.520]  mainline connection to that. You see the Trotskyites founding the neocons after
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:10.360]  Trotsky was run into Mexico and then killed. And then the founder of the
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:15.920]  neocons, you know, being the, you know, the deputy Trotskyite. And then you've
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.680]  got all those guys entering the winehouse. That's why they want to re, and
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.720]  you've got Gennrich writing books about ending American sovereignty and writing
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:28.480]  the intro to Alvin and Heidi Toffler's, you know, World Government book. So you
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:32.880]  just brought that up. I mean, they want order out of chaos, as Bush said. And
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.360]  that's their stratagem. And has come in really what it is, is nothing but a light
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:43.520]  nomenclature to encapsulate their insanity. These people are the great,
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.960]  great, great grandchildren of the Illuminati. And you just said it.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:53.640]  Well, they've got more, they've got more chaos than order. Yeah. But you just
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:54.880]  said it. They are the Illuminati.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.880]  Well, I don't know how they think of themselves and the parallel you draw
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:09.080]  may be accurate. But the issues before us are, are, are not historical to the
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:15.560]  present day and the future. And the question is, how do you pull back from
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:22.600]  these confrontations? We won't China out of Africa because it has all
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:29.960]  investments in three countries. Angola, Nigeria, and Libya. And so we want
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:36.560]  them out because it's a way of hurting their economy by making their oil
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:42.840]  supplies less certain. Of course, they can buy oil in the markets as long as
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:50.160]  it's available to them. But the backup investments they had were was like
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.600]  insurance. And so we're depriving them of the insurance. That'll make them a
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:50:00.920]  bit more nervous. They won't like it. They'll, their hostility toward the
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:05.600]  United States will rise. And the same with Russia. We have Russia rang with
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:09.360]  military bases. And now it has a naval base in the Mediterranean that
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:15.520]  Washington thinks of as its sea. And Washington doesn't want Russia to have
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:23.640]  a naval base there. And so the turmoil has been stirred up in Syria. And I'm
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:30.480]  sure a lot of that turmoil is indigenous and right. But this there's the CIA's
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.160]  hand there. The courts are clear that we've been supporting opposition
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:40.000]  groups there with money and apparently now the weapons stay there. Dr. Roberts,
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.240]  I want to get your take on where you see this going on the massacre that our
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:52.120]  media is applauding against the Syrians. How can they attack Gaddafi claiming he
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:56.920]  did something like this with no proof? But then pray is open mass murder in
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:00.680]  front of every one of the peaceful protesters. This is the opposite of our
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:05.240]  Republic. GCN listeners, why have you been hearing so much about Dermatol, the

[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:11.320]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:14.760]  than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:18.520]  before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our

[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:13.280]  Alright, final segment with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. Coming up at the bottom of the
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:17.640]  next hour we have Mike Adams. Food Wars, how European health authorities are
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:22.000]  using the E. Coli scare to wage economic warfare against vegetable farmers. Big
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.280]  Agra always uses this stuff when generally they're the cause to then go after the
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:30.400]  small producers. The same thing's happening in Europe and evidence shows
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:35.520]  it's genetically engineered. That is coming up. A lot of other important news.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:40.040]  Dr. Roberts, we've only got about four minutes left with you. What's your view
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:46.960]  of Israel mowing down, reportedly killing MSNBC says, 63 peaceful people
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:50.480]  walking on to Syrian land. They were behind barbed wire. They could have just
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:55.280]  arrested them. Instead, just shoot them in front of the Israelis actually
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.800]  released footage of it. But then we've got to invade Libya because he might have
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:05.160]  shot a couple protesters. And so we've got to have a new war. But it's not a
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:11.600]  ground war, but it is. I mean, this hypocrisy has reached new heights. Yes,
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:17.520]  of course. But you see, the Palestinians are demonized, aren't they? They're all
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:24.480]  terrorists. They all run around with bombs on their bodies. And so no one
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:28.960]  cares what happens to the Palestinians. They're demonized, like the
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:34.680]  Senate Edwards is now being prosecuted for a non-crime by the Department of
[01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:41.000]  Justice. And of course, as we've already discussed, Libya, the whole reason is to
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:48.320]  check China has nothing to do with anything that Qadashi did except let
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:55.920]  China into Libyan oil investments. So you do a very good job, Alex, on your show
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:02.480]  of making it clear that literally everything that is told to us by the
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:11.760]  media is a lie, serving some more powerful interests. And so that's just what we
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:20.480]  see, everything. And you expose it over and over, such as this problem with a
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:27.560]  ledge problem with German vegetables. It's everything is a lie to serve a
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:33.640]  powerful interest. And so Qadashi, we've never heard a word about him being
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:38.640]  oppressive or anything of the sort. And all of a sudden we have to get him out
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:42.000]  because he's oppressive. We're getting him out because of China's oil investments.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.080]  In closing, the Standard and Poor's a few months ago said we may lose the credit
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:50.400]  rating and then that would make the deficit exponentially larger. And now
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:55.120]  Moody's is coming out saying something similar. Are things accelerating towards
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:01.440]  ahead? No, what they're saying, they're giving the Republicans pressure to put
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:07.040]  on Obama to cut Medicare and Social Security. That's what that's about. Do
[01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:12.880]  you really think Moody's could get away with reducing the US credit rating? They
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:16.640]  would be arrested, they would be waterboarded, they would be
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:22.240]  said to be terrorists, hurting the war on terror, trying to bring America down.
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:28.400]  There's no chance of any of these punk rating agencies. They all answer to
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:32.080]  Wall Street. Wall Street's their pay master. I totally agree. It's right when
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:36.040]  they want to pass new gun control. Adam Dodon comes out and says Al Qaeda wants
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.000]  to buy guns at gun shows. Right when they're trying to do the austerity to
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.920]  give the bankers more of our money, they have the rating just like
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:49.840]  Paulson terrorized people in October of 2008 saying give us money or we'll plunge
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:55.320]  the economy. Right, so no they're not going to downgrade. It's all propaganda
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:59.480]  to help the Republicans cut Social Security and Medicare. That's what it's
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:02.880]  all about and Wall Street wants those cut because it wants them privatized
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:05.960]  because they can make more hundreds of billions of dollars if they can
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:10.960]  privatize Social Security, they can privatize Medicare. That's money for
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:16.520]  Wall Street and so that's what it's about. His book is available in
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:20.800]  bookstores everywhere in an Amazon. How the economy was lost, the war of the
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:25.120]  worlds. We have that link to the bottom of his latest article. How the Empire
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:29.000]  will prevail, will Washington foment war between China and India. Dr. Paul Craig
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.080]  Roberts, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, former head of policy
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.880]  Department of Treasury. Thank you so much for spending time with us Doc.

[01:59:51.920 --> 02:00:00.880]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:12.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:21.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:23.480]  Jones.
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:35.120]  Well, DrudgeReport.com. I tell you, Drudge has a lot of courage. He also knows
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:39.880]  where the people's minds are. That's why he's the number one news outfit online in
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:43.160]  the world, dwarfing everything else. Major studies, even the New York Times has
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.200]  had to admit, show that he's the number one news driver out there. Well, you guys
[02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:53.440]  are losing subscribers, losing readers, losing viewers. I'm not probably the best
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:56.520]  radio host in the world. I mean, I've got historical knowledge. I can be
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:06.160]  entertaining. I'm okay, but why do I have 24 million? In fact, will you print me
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:09.720]  again or get the IT guy to print me the Shotcast statistics? You go to
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:16.720]  shotcast.com and click on statistics and it's a 24 million people. 24 million
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:19.880]  seven hundred something thousand. I'll print up the actual numbers here in a
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:23.080]  minute. You can go to shotcast.com and, you know, we're number one there and you
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:25.960]  can click on statistics. We've been number one for four or five years and
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:32.000]  talk radio for internet streaming, but now we're number one period against 24
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:46.840]  hour Chinese music stations, German, US, 24 million, almost 25 million people tuned
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:51.560]  in just over that platform. That's only one way we stream. Then we've got the
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:56.760]  free podcast. You just go to the listen tab at info wars.com to get that. We're
[02:01:56.760 --> 02:01:59.600]  about to update it. It's like four or five years old. It's the old-fashioned
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:02.320]  where you copy the text and put it in your computer. We're going to try to get a
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:06.880]  WordPress feed to make it a little bit more high-tech. We tend to set things up
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:09.960]  and move forward and we've got a lot of other ways we're streamed. A lot of
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:14.360]  radio stations stream the show. Genesis GCM live streams the show. That's not
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:21.600]  counting all the other ways we stream. One way we stream 24 million and memory
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:29.520]  serves 700,000. In fact, I can even go to Shotcast right here. Shotcast.com hit
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:37.800]  enter and it will take me there. Now I'm on Shotcast. I got a bunch of news
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:43.640]  coming up after the break, but I'll get to that in a minute. I go there and then
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:53.200]  I'm looking for the statistics. Top 10 list. Mail. AOL owns this. Well, there's
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:57.440]  Alex Jones at the top. Just one of our streams live right now. There's a whole
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:02.680]  bunch of them in there. 15,143. But if you had them all together listening
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:07.600]  at any one time, it's more than 30,000. I'm trying to find the statistics
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:12.440]  tab. I'll find the IT guy there in the break and find it because he used to be
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:15.320]  right up there at the top.
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:23.600]  Let me see. Broadcasting tools, partners, blog, radio players. I don't know. I'll
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:26.880]  have to find that during the break. I thought it was there a lot easier to
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:32.920]  find. Point is it's 24 million and change and I sent that over to Watson
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:36.160]  last night, but he's been so busy writing other articles. He didn't do a blurb on
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:42.760]  it, but the illustration here is that people are hungry for the truth. And how
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:45.560]  did I get into this discussion? Oh, yeah, the Drudge Report. There's a reason the
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:50.440]  Drudge Report for now more than 15 years has been number one and is getting even
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:55.320]  bigger. The reason it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:59.880]  bigger and bigger is because Drudge knows what you want to see. The full
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:07.920]  spectrum of news. What is interesting? What is hidden? And more and more, Drudge
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:13.020]  is carrying PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com articles. And that just
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:17.680]  shows that this information, this idea of liberty and freedom and understanding
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:27.120]  the real geopolitical systems, is an idea whose time has come. And that we've
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:33.000]  got a fighting chance against this globalist system. If we now use the
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:37.360]  massive base of people we have that are awake, if they reach out and wake up
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:41.560]  others, and then they reach out and wake up others, and if they reach out and
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:45.760]  wake up others. But in a month, the month of May, the numbers just came out. 24
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:50.640]  million plus. I actually had the printout last night and I'll find that
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:54.520]  during the break. But then I've got all the other news. The whole Adam Gadan
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:05:00.480]  situation. I mean, hidden in plain view, Adam Gadan, Adam Perlman.
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:04.840]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:10.520]  tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:15.400]  says that the state is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one
[02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:20.080]  of the most oppressive police states on earth. This film conclusively proves the
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:24.400]  existence of a secret network of FEMA cares, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:28.360]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:32.440]  established an all-powerful shadow state. Police State 4 chronicles the
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:36.800]  sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secret
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:42.000]  of world of emergency dictatorship. Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.720]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of the
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:52.360]  new world order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure

[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:03.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:07.760]  solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double
[02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:12.120]  or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:16.400]  much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:20.760]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number
[02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:24.840]  three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:29.400]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:33.520]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year thousands of
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:37.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:41.320]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks I
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:44.000]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:08.040]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:14.040]  Incredible news. I said that's where I thought it would be going last Friday.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:18.680]  Food wars, how European health authorities are using E. coli scared to
[02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:22.800]  wage economic warfare against vegetable farmers. Coming up at the bottom of the
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:27.920]  hour the head of natural news Mike Adams joins us. Forensic evidence emerges that
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:32.920]  European E. coli superbug was bioengineered to produce human fatalities
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:37.920]  and they've got all the documentation on that and we're gonna break down similar
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:42.520]  food scares that were done here to try to pass the Food Safety Act written by
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:48.520]  Big Agra openly to shut down small farms and ranches who in almost every case
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:52.840]  are not involved in the food chain breakdown. It's Big Agra that's doing
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.280]  it and we're gonna talk about some of the things that have caused mutations in
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:02.440]  the past. They spray a liquid vaccine on the food crops and you could just type
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:06.120]  in six years ago it'll come up that we'll do it right now or we'll do it after
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:14.240]  cover some other news. FDA approves virus spray for meat and it goes in and
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:22.080]  and and and and and the virus is then inject into the E. coli and kill them but
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:26.080]  it's a it's a live vaccine and so it's had big mutation problems. Well they
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:29.680]  don't care. I mean if it kills you it doesn't matter because they'll just use
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.280]  that to pass laws to shut down local law and it should have nothing to do with it.
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:38.520]  Or make you get a $10 tag for a $5 chicken but then Tyson's exempt. You
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:42.760]  got 20 chickens here's your tag. Tyson and other big companies causing the
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:46.960]  problems they're exempt. They wrote the law just like McDonald's is exempt from
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:50.320]  having to get health insurance along with 2,000 plus other companies that give
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:55.320]  to Obama. Just like General Electric's exempt from having to clean up their cold
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:59.120]  plants and they can build new ones but every other major company can. That's how
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:03.520]  the global mafia operates. By the way I found that if you go to shotcast.com
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:08.080]  where we're number one not just for talk radio but number one period. If you go
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:16.680]  there 24,753,204 or almost 25 million number one above music talk and
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:23.320]  that's only one way we stream one format. One format. We have eight different
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:29.080]  YouTube channels. One of them has 114 million views and is exponentially
[02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:34.240]  growing. Again that's the power of the truth. The Obama deception see more than
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:40.120]  30 million times on Google and YouTube alone. One version 9 million views. That's
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:45.640]  the power of the alternative media. That's the power of you blocking the
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:49.600]  troll attacks against info wars.com and prison planet.com blocking the troll
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:55.080]  attacks dealing exposing them with the truth on our YouTube channels dealing
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:11:00.200]  with all their co-intel pro. We are winning and the ideas and understanding
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:04.000]  is spreading. They can't just whack Alex Jones because there's so many countless
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.160]  other people becoming more and more prominent telling the truth. Liberty is
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:13.520]  rising. It's so exciting. So you just go to shotcast.com click on help and then
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:18.760]  the first link is stats. You can see that number one. Number one ladies and
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:22.360]  gentlemen. Number one in more and more avenues more and more places. So many
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:27.560]  shows say we're number one. I've never really sat here and explained we've been
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:32.640]  number one for a long time and becoming even more number one. Of course then
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:36.880]  again drudgerport.com is number one period for news sites in the world.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:42.760]  That's number one up there. So very exciting and other media just can't
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:47.240]  tell the truth. Can't talk about real issues and that's why no one reads you.
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:51.800]  No one listens to you. No one talks about you. Oh a lot of it's hidden in
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:55.440]  plain view. It's in Reuters AP that world government's being set up by private
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:12:00.320]  banks but it's a little footnote and no talk show host cover it. CNN doesn't
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:06.360]  cover it. Oh but drudge links to it. Reuters yesterday. World Bank wants
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:13.200]  global CO2 taxes on human activity. He did. We did. Oh it's there. So what are
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:17.120]  these companies in government want? They want to stop the aggregator sites. The
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:21.680]  sites that take a collection of news linked to it and pointed out. But see we
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:25.600]  don't even need to do that. We consider with the articles and cover and have
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:29.800]  commentary on them. It's the analysis people want and the truth is once you
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:33.560]  figure out how the world really works things stop not making sense and now
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:37.640]  make perfect sense. Once you start reading UN documents, World Bank documents,
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:42.520]  they're whole blueprints right there. You don't even have to know. They've been so
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.560]  arrogant and think you're not reading what they're saying. They're out in the
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:48.800]  open. People say Alex how do you predict this? How do you predict that? How
[02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:51.560]  did you know this was going to happen? How did you know they're going to say
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:54.400]  that Al Qaeda is going to start attacking shopping malls? Because I had police
[02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:57.840]  telling me and got documents years ago that they're hyping this fear up and
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:00.800]  saying it's not a question of it but when so they can roll TSA out on the
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:04.640]  streets and clamp down and have martial law in America. All this has been
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.600]  martial law training. Now let me get to the next news. Let's just play a clip
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:16.520]  here from national TV hyping up the fear and hyping up that oh my gosh we
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:20.680]  don't have enough gun laws. Al Qaeda is going to get us and Adam Gadan, Adam
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:24.680]  Perlman, the grandson of the former head of the ADL who got arrested beating up
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:29.320]  Muslims. He hated them so much in Southern California. He magically uploaded
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:34.800]  the same Intel Center video layer as the Al Qaeda logo. Wired magazine three years
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:40.680]  ago. This guy comes out right as Obama gets ready and Kurt Nimmels article
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.760]  writes about this today. Right as they're about to launch this month their new
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:47.320]  gun control initiative. He comes out and says guns are so easy to get in America.
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:52.120]  Let's exploit the fact that they have gun shows. You can buy guns, private seller.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:55.720]  You can sell your neighbor a gun. You can go to a gun show and sell one but you
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:59.200]  can't if you're a federal firearms dealer and officially won. They want to
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:03.280]  register all guns. They want to ban all semi-auto. So he comes out and says oh the
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:08.320]  dumb Americans they have guns. I mean the ADL has always been anti-gun. Now
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:14.360]  here's this this minion. Again use your common sense. Get a passport. Fly out of
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:19.240]  the exploded plane. Not be damaged and be found on 9-11 of the chief hijacker.
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:24.920]  Government says that happened. Does Al Qaeda if it's real this anti-Israel
[02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:29.160]  anti-Semitic hate-filled group which was admittedly set up by the CIA. That's on
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:34.960]  record. Magically the head. They're now saying he may be in the top five. Maybe
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.680]  number one. He's in the top five. Four of the top five from America and we're all
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:44.080]  a lock. He hanging out the Pentagon. Don't forget all that. The head of Al Qaeda is
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:49.600]  a fat Jewish kid from California whose videos get uploaded in a Pentagon front
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:54.600]  group website in the same video logo. The Al Qaeda logo is in the same as the
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:15:00.200]  Intel Center logo. Now if you believe that ladies and gentlemen. I mean ladies
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:04.160]  and gentlemen I could grow a big beard and put a turban on and upload videos and
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:09.640]  say you Americans I'm going to get you. You know we good. You got guns over there
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:14.360]  so we're gonna get them and kill you. Right as the gun. Look Obama got caught. We
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:18.400]  told you this six years ago. We told you this a year and a half ago that the
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:24.920]  Justice Department was gonna use American guns in Mexico to get our guns. Now you
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:28.760]  hear them. Press conferences. We've got to ban semi-auto and ban multiple sale
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:32.400]  and shut down gun shows because the stuff in Mexico is happening because of
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:35.560]  American guns. Turns out that isn't true. Most of them are sold by the military.
[02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:39.620]  They're fully auto. Grenade launchers hand grenades. But it turns out over 10,000
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:44.600]  guns ATF agents nationwide are ordered to let them be shipped into Mexico and to
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:49.560]  help so they can trace them back. That's a false flag right there. So you got to
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.520]  decide. You love the fetish of fearing Muslims all day and these fake. Look look
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:16:00.920]  you want AP. You want UPI. Type in Israel founded Hamas AP UPI. I'm not saying
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:04.280]  there aren't real people that attack Israel. The point is Israel has fake
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:07.840]  groups. I showed you yesterday. WikiLeaks 2008 released in the Army
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:12.320]  admitted army document how to stage false flag attacks. The army teaches its
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:17.800]  captains in special ops how to stage attacks. Okay. I mean there's an army
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:27.000]  manuals. Grow up. Wake up. This is real. Adam Goodon. Adam Goodon called for gun
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.280]  violence merges with Obama under the radar. Remember I told you that when they
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:36.880]  try to pass the cyber security actor to be a big hack attack. It happened. Now
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.600]  China saying the U.S. is doing it to itself. ABC News to pass the cyber
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:44.600]  security takeover. Right as they want to raise the debt ceiling. They start
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:49.360]  threatening to implode the economy just like in 2008. The banks do. Right as they
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:53.280]  roll out the new anti-gun control legislation. Al Qaeda pops up and says
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:56.800]  yes because your gun laws are lax. We're going to attack your shopping malls
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:01.000]  and they and the globalists may do it and that's how they're going to roll TSA
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.200]  out nationwide. Folks this is how the globalists take over. They stage the
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.760]  events. That's how tyranny wins. Here is the Adam Goodon clip. Listen to this
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:14.840]  place to play an important and decisive part in the jihad against the Zionist
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:20.360]  and crusaders is this the new face of Al Qaeda a threatening new video
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:25.880]  surfacing on the web. The so-called American Taliban in it a chilling
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:30.280]  call to arms for would be terrorist. He urges Al Qaeda sympathizers already in
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:34.920]  the U.S. to exploit weaknesses in U.S. gun laws and background checks to get
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:40.760]  weapons and go on a rampage. America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:46.400]  firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:51.360]  away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:55.560]  likely without having to show an identification card. He's encouraging
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:18:00.320]  lone wolf attacks similar to but less sophisticated than that's enough. Terrorist
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:04.600]  Faisal Shazad. Yeah and then they go over the fact that the people that have struck
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:08.000]  the U.S. who were admittedly under U.S. government control in Patsy's and allowed
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.440]  to do it and commanded by people they thought were Al Qaeda but were FBI.
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen that is directly violence policy center Brady Center ADL
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.440]  anti-gun. I mean they call you anti-Semitic if you're pro-gun. I mean
[02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:28.120]  these people are nuts. Openly you've got the Jewish head of Al Qaeda. I mean it
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:33.240]  doesn't get any more ridiculous than this. In our face with pure anti-gun lobby
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:38.200]  you can buy fully automatic. He even puts on the fake foreign accent. I mean it's
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:42.640]  ridiculous. Get down to the gun shows and they're like everybody's like we better
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:46.160]  pass laws right as Obama and it was announced weeks ago. In the month of
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:49.480]  June we'll announce he wants to ban the gun show loophole that's private sale.
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:52.720]  Selling your neighbor a gun, giving your grandson a gun, giving your son a gun,
[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:56.600]  your wife a gun, your wife giving your husband a gun. I bought my wife a gun.
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:01.840]  She's bought me guns. Oh my gosh. Ban that. Ban semi-auto total and there he is
[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:05.520]  lying saying you can buy full auto to scare people. Direct White House
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:10.640]  propaganda out of Al Qaeda. What is it gonna take for you to wake up? You know
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:12.880]  how they're gonna put TSA on the streets that they've been beta testing
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:16.920]  getting ready for? I told you for years. Shootings at shopping malls claiming
[02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:20.360]  American Taliban Al Qaeda and in these reports they put out they claim the
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:26.520]  militias. The militias secretly work for Al Qaeda. Folks the militias after
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:30.880]  9-11 got mad at me because they are we're so patriotic they bought the
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:35.840]  propaganda that this was all real and we're selling Muslim hunting licenses
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:41.040]  on their websites. The good old boys with Johnny Rev flags hanging up in their
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:50.720]  basements are working for Al Qaeda. I mean there's only there's only one. Oh but
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:57.160]  yeah the American Taliban the White Al Qaeda led by the Jewish guy is gonna
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:01.520]  attack us. I mean does anybody buy this? All right on time. Do you want to learn
[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:04.880]  more about preparing for the hard times ahead? Have you ever thought about

[02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:03.760]  Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:07.480]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know
[02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:11.320]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:14.680]  gold? It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:18.480]  country and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:22.200]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:27.400]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:31.160]  nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These
[02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:34.840]  seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:38.880]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:44.040]  survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at

[02:22:54.800 --> 02:22:59.160]  seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:03.160]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about a product the drug companies
[02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:07.840]  don't want you to know about. It's called osteocay. Osteocay is an osteoporosis
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:12.240]  supplement shown to decrease fractures 87% without any of the dangerous side
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:16.200]  effects of medications. Calcium and vitamin D only decrease fractures by
[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:22.200]  16%. Osteocay decreases fractures an astounding 87%. Friends osteoporosis is
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:26.120]  a deadly disease. Research shows the most effective approach for protecting your
[02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:30.760]  bones is not a drug at all. It's osteocay. Manufactured entirely in America.
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:34.640]  Osteocay is available without a prescription and comes with unconditional
[02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:37.840]  money-back guarantee. Don't wait until it's too late because if you have
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:42.160]  osteoporosis and fracture a hip you have a 20% chance of dying within a year. I
[02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:45.880]  urge you to take charge of your health today. I cannot recommend this breakthrough
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:54.600]  product enough. Go to www.nbihelth.com or call 800-624-1416 right now.
[02:23:54.600 --> 02:24:00.840]  That's 800-624-1416. Start taking Osteocay.
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:11.080]  I'm gonna talk more towards the end of the hour after Adams joins us about this
[02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:15.680]  whole situation that Al Qaeda is set to strike. They're gonna shoot and kill
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.240]  everybody any minute. Give your guns up and they'll go stage a few CIA run
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:24.440]  Mumbai attacks and that's even come out Chicago Tribune that reportedly a top
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:28.720]  CIA guy ran that. That's what the Indians said at the time and they will come
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:32.160]  for your guns and good old boys will say I guess I'm gonna turn mine in or
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:38.480]  register it. I'm not with Al Qaeda. I mean it's ridiculous and that's how they're
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:41.360]  gonna turn the TSA loose on you and how long did I tell you that they were
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:44.320]  getting ready for this and when they started hyping it get ready for it to
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:50.160]  happen. They think you're stupid. Okay America hadn't run by America anymore.
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:53.400]  Here's some of the financial news. Grease to start austerity drive as
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:57.920]  nation sees. They don't even owe most of the debt over 90% in theirs. All of it
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:03.000]  has to be paid to foreign bankers. Continuing state local layoffs to hit
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:07.480]  record levels. Land off local government. Being replaced though with federal jobs.
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:12.440]  Feds are federalizing everything. Oh cops they told you right more tickets they
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:16.040]  wouldn't lay off. Sorry they lied to you. That money goes right to the bankers.
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:22.160]  Bankrupt claim highlights Spanish debt fears. Financial times. Dominique Strauss
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:27.440]  Kahn expected to claim he was given irregularities in the way he was
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:32.840]  arrested and I've got a bunch of other really key news. China has divested 97%
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:41.080]  of its holdings in US Treasury bills. Unbelievable report. Continuing here with
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:45.720]  some of the financial news. The London independence reporting that the housing
[02:25:45.720 --> 02:25:52.400]  slump is bigger than the Great Depression. All of that is happening but but I
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:56.120]  want to get into gold and silver. Let's put on screen for presentplanet.tv
[02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:01.120]  viewers. For radio listeners just search 11 year gold graph. They're the same
[02:26:01.120 --> 02:26:10.000]  everywhere. And you look at it back in what 2000 and well the year 2000 and
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:17.080]  2001 $200 $260 and then you see it a month or so month and a half ago
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:25.760]  dropping from 1570 something down to 1490 or so. It's now gone back up to
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:30.160]  almost where it was. Now look at that tiny dip there at the very end. That was
[02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:34.080]  the end of the gold run. The implosion. You idiots that bought gold or fools.
[02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:38.760]  They do that every time it dips but every time it dips it then only goes
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:45.960]  back up. And this is how they fool people. So I want to bring Ted Anderson up.
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:49.640]  Same thing with silver. Silver starting to go back up but not like gold. Gold's
[02:26:49.640 --> 02:26:53.600]  moved even faster though the summer is usually the doldrums. Ted Anderson
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:59.440]  explain what's going on here. Well here we are Alex in June. Gold is 1.5% from
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:06.120]  its market high right now at $15.5480. It's only seen $1560 an ounce so far.
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:11.320]  There's been plenty of attempts by the elite to try to draw this price down or
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:16.400]  knock it down and it just isn't happening. I mean like CNBC's you know
[02:27:16.400 --> 02:27:20.840]  one of their headlines that just says whore for US economy is data falls off
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:27.520]  the cliff. Gold you know has just been climbing like crazy. Silver also very
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:32.760]  goodbye. You know once we've seen silver drop down to that 33 level and then start
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:36.720]  climbing back up to 40. I mean people that hadn't got on the bandwagon at that
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:41.320]  time made a big mistake. We are in the summer but we are seeing one of the
[02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:47.400]  strongest summers we've seen in a long time and besides that Alex for $125 to
[02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:53.080]  be able to get your videos that talk about this this Bilderberg thing that's
[02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.880]  coming up here. People need to know this stuff. There's no question about it and
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:01.720]  all they need to do is for $125 they're gonna get three silver dollars and you
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:05.840]  to get the Obama deception. You're gonna get endgame. You're gonna get fall of
[02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:12.440]  the Republic and it's all focusing on what these crazy lunatics are gonna be
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:17.400]  doing in Switzerland. Getting the word out now is and also I can say it
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.040]  supports the network but you shall basically at cost so it doesn't really
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:24.600]  support much but it's your lost leader to get folks into gold and silver. It's a
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:29.560]  you know great move you're doing Ted but to explain to people where is gold
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:33.040]  right now. I mean I know it went down a little but it's gone right back up. Well
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:39.120]  gold currently right now is trading at $15.4560. Seen a high today of $15.5480.
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:45.560]  Silver right now $36.95. Seen a high today of $37.41. Pretty darn strong Alex.
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:49.440]  And that's during the dead summer. Now is the time to get into gold and silver in my
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:53.720]  humble opinion because of dollar devaluation worldwide other concerted
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:59.000]  currencies being driven down. Oh in the long term historically commodities will
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.040]  only go up because the commodities aren't going up. The currencies are going
[02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:09.480]  down. It's called inflation and every time they do this every year they drive it
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:13.080]  down a little bit but it always goes back up more than it did previously. They're
[02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:17.440]  trying to fool people. When folks call you to ask for the three video three
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:21.400]  silver dollar special you pay cost for the three silver dollars and you get
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:24.720]  three of my films free on top of it with free shipping. They've got a lot of
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:32.440]  specials on gold and silver. Ask for the radio specials 800-686-2237. It's gone
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:36.400]  down a little but it's gone back up now but not as much as it had. Now is the
[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:45.680]  time to buy in my opinion. 800-686-2237-800-686-2237. Ted stay there.
[02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:48.000]  We're gonna come back for one minute on the other side. I want you to tell people
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:55.480]  about some of the specials. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex

[02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:11.560]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:15.160]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:20.200]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[02:32:20.200 --> 02:32:25.560]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall
[02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:30.440]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:34.840]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:38.600]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more
[02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:42.520]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems
[02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:48.080]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:54.120]  the Republic. Get your copy of Fall the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or

[02:33:29.720 --> 02:33:34.160]  with Ted Anderson on the markets. Ted tell folks because obviously when gold
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:36.840]  dipped that's why you've been so successful and silver dipped. You
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:40.720]  understand they always just run it back up in the last 11 years as they
[02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:45.880]  continue to devalue the currency. So then when silver and gold went down you
[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:49.600]  went in and bought big. Now you can offer it and pass on savings to people
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:53.840]  that it's gone back up. Tell folks about the radio specials that you've got for
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:58.480]  them. Sure. You can get a Frank $338. Get a full year subscription to the

[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:08.920]  British sovereigns at 424. I mean the walking liberties right now are 1802.
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:13.000]  Obviously they're gonna go up with silver prices rising like that had. There's a
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.920]  lot of things that are going on. What about US Eagles right now at 1654? I mean
[02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:22.240]  that everything Alex you got to realize that yeah you can get in right now and
[02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:25.640]  you can actually get some supply because it's summer because less people are
[02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:29.400]  looking at gold but by gosh that's the time to do it. People that are not
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:33.080]  positioned by August are really gonna find that they're gonna have to pay a
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:37.240]  lot more. In addition to this that's when you have when you have news like
[02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:41.920]  CNN coming out of talking about whore for the US economy and the dollar falls
[02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:46.120]  off the cliff. It actually makes an impact you know because people are so
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:51.040]  concerned. You know right now Alex you can save yourself by buying silver and
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:55.780]  gold but by God you can save this entire nation if you buy these silver
[02:34:55.780 --> 02:34:59.480]  dollars in your videos and watch them and pass them out to your friends and
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:03.760]  family members that actually care. You know that's what we need to do. We need
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:07.600]  to save this nation. We're watching this thing go right off a cliff and it's up
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:12.280]  to us to turn it around and we need to be politically active and that's how you
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:16.920]  get involved. You got to have to have a general understanding as to what this
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:22.120]  elite group is doing, what the Fed is up to, and why our dollar is falling like
[02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:25.480]  it is and the only way you're gonna understand that is by getting your
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:29.440]  videos and actually watching these things. You're absolutely right Ted. It's a
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:36.720]  smoking good deal. 800-686-237-800-686-237. I hope folks will check it out
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:41.360]  today. Thank you so much Ted Anderson. Yeah you got it Alex. All right going now
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:46.720]  to Mike Adams. Going back to last week I've seen this so many times. Right
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:49.600]  when Europe's trying to pass laws like our food safety bill, they've already
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:53.800]  passed Codex Alimentarius to ban most vitamins and minerals, they have a big
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:58.840]  outbreak. They have other outbreaks here in the US always by Big Agra in every
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:03.360]  big case, some big giant factory, and then they Big Agra gave $17 million in
[02:36:03.360 --> 02:36:09.160]  one week in November to try to pass the Food Safety Act like the Patriot Act
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:12.600]  where all these names, nothing to do with that, to openly put regulations on
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:18.480]  farms, ranches, and everybody else. Just incredible, absolutely incredible
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:23.440]  developments just off the charts, but it failed thanks to Ron Paul and listeners
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:27.600]  and folks understood what was happening. And the SWAT teaming of the Amish, all of
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:33.600]  this is about shutting this stuff down. It's about creating monopolies. That's
[02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:39.120]  what big mega business and big agra business does. And so I saw this and I
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:42.120]  went, wait what do I know about E. Coli? I know it's one of the first bacteria
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:46.040]  ever engineered. I know in the mid 60s or early 60s you just pull up
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:50.920]  manufacturing process of aspartame, the military engineered one that would eat
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:54.520]  toxic waste. They've worked on a lot of bacteria that'll do that, like the oil
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:37:00.120]  eating bacteria, but this is different. And I remember the report and you pull it
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:06.720]  up where they took it and then what it excretes, it's waste. Bacteria, you know,
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:12.080]  use the bathroom as well. Their excretia is this highly toxic, addictive sweet
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:16.280]  substance. Like antifreeze is sweet. Everything sweet isn't good. And they
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:21.680]  couldn't get it approved until 1981 when Rumsfeld got it approved. Now, then I
[02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:29.520]  remember the virus sprays that they spray on meats they approved six years
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:35.160]  ago on E. Coli. Live viruses that eat them, that destroy them. And so I know that
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:39.360]  that E. Coli is one of the most engineered bacteria out there. And they've
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:43.440]  engineered it into plants and all sorts of stuff. And so I said, you know, look
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:46.800]  for this to be some big agra disaster or something that got out of the lab
[02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:50.040]  because they were reporting by Friday that it appeared to be genetically
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:53.680]  engineered. Well, Mike Adams, great researcher over at naturalnews.com,
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:57.880]  joining us via video Skype. Forensic evidence emerges that European E. Coli
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:38:02.480]  Superbug was bioengineered to produce human fatalities. That's the newest
[02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:08.000]  article today, yesterday. Today he's got food wars, how European health authorities
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:12.280]  are using E. Coli's scare to wage economic warfare against vegetable farmers. He
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:17.200]  joins us now. Mike, right as they try to pass the Cyber Security Act and this
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:20.560]  big global UN Act to restrict free speech and take over the web and put in
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.000]  snooping hubs, hack attacks happen. China says it's the West doing it. Right as
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:29.280]  they try to pass these laws, these outbreaks always happen. I mean, this
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:33.800]  is getting pretty darn obvious. Well, you're exactly right, Alex. You've laid it
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:40.080]  out. It's classic problem reaction solution. They're using it in every
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:43.400]  area, but especially in agriculture. Every time they want to pass more food
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:48.680]  regulations, they engineer another disaster and they create a fear campaign.
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:54.480]  And there's so many agendas that they can then pursue with this fear. It's not
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:39:00.360]  just to enable them to enact new food regulations and tyrannical legislation
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:04.040]  and crackdown on small farms and, you know, raid the Amish at gunpoint and
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:09.040]  things like that. It's also the fact that they can retaliate against Spain.
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:14.560]  Because remember, Spain stood up against the GMO agenda. Spain said we don't want
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:19.080]  GMOs in our country, even as, and this came out of WikiLeaks, by the way, even as
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:25.200]  the US was working on a plan to force European nations to accept GMOs. This is
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:30.480]  now retaliation. In a matter of less than a week, they have destroyed much of
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:35.400]  Spain's agricultural economy. At least those farmers engaged in fresh vegetable
[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:40.120]  farming. So this is an act of economic warfare on that front. It's an act of
[02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:45.240]  biological warfare against the innocent victims who are now being harmed by this
[02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:49.280]  bacteria strain, which is clearly, it has clearly been bioengineered and we
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:52.440]  could probably get into more of that. Well, two and a half years ago we broke
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:56.000]  down that the flu was engineered and they, because we had documents previous
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:01.320]  when they engineered the H1N1, hiding in plain view the London Telegraph article
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:10.360]  where 30 homeless people in one place, given the shot, died. The live bird flu
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:15.960]  virus that killed the ferrets in the vaccines in 12 countries where they did
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:21.480]  the test. I mean, we have this long history and you have thousands of biotech
[02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:27.280]  companies splicing bacteria with animal, insect, top experts saying it can give
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:31.720]  rise to mutations. And then immediately when we see some, and the media is
[02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:36.720]  saying it appears to be genetically engineered, it's been altered. They try
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:41.160]  to blame farmers for it and then it always comes out later it's either a
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:45.720]  something that got loose or was manufactured or it's something that
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:50.920]  mutated. I mean, I know you've written about the virus spray. They spray on meat
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.400]  that attacks the E. Coli. Yeah, well it's incredible what they're doing here. We
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:41:00.400]  were watching a circus, a circus of fear mongering. They screamed cucumbers and
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:04.280]  everybody stopped buying cucumbers. Then they screamed tomatoes. Then they
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:09.760]  screamed lettuce. And it's like we're watching a circus of health regulator
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:15.240]  lunatics who are running around destroying food industries, destroying the
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:20.200]  the economics of farmers one by one. It's like I wrote, it's like a Godzilla
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:25.080]  marching through the city stomping on farmers tents at the farmers markets.
[02:41:25.080 --> 02:41:28.320]  They're just destroying this industry with no credibility. And they're saying
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:31.720]  we've got to have government inspectors. You've got to have a license to grow
[02:41:31.720 --> 02:41:36.000]  anything because your tomato might kill somebody. But in every case I see it's
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.960]  never little farms that do it. It's always big mega agra. That's right. And
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:44.040]  today Wall Street Journal broke this article which we just wrote about also
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:48.760]  that says it's not the sprouts. Just until this morning they were blaming the
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:53.600]  organic sprouts from northern Germany. Well they ran tests on that and the tests
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:57.280]  all came up negative. So it's not the sprouts. That's the key. They keep blaming
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:04.400]  a string of organic industry. They do. And the media in the UK was printing
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:08.680]  quotes from people based on this fear who were saying oh I'm never eating
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:13.200]  organic again. Well that's the reaction they want you to have because they want
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:17.000]  you to be afraid of vegetables. They want you to be afraid of small farms. They
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.080]  want you to be afraid of fresh food because then you'll buy processed
[02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:25.960]  dead foods that keep you sick and keep you a customer of the pharmaceutical
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:30.160]  industry. Well notice, notice 50 years ago they went and harassed normal milk out
[02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:33.600]  of existence because they wanted to be able to boil it and sell bad milk to
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:36.840]  people before you got fresh milk delivered to your door. Who wants that
[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:42.280]  service? Statistically it's much safer than the garbage they sell. I mean it's
[02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:46.840]  the same on every front. Problem reaction solution. It's the one trick these
[02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:51.440]  guys do over and over again. You and you go over the evidence of this. I mean this
[02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:57.280]  stuff it has resistance to everything. Go over your articles. Well you're right.
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:43:01.360]  There's something called a genetic analysis of the E. coli strain and
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:06.080]  genetic analysis is actually quite advanced from a technical point of
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:12.200]  view. You can determine what the strain was exposed to in its history to create
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:16.840]  the current strain and when you look at this and that was done by the Robert
[02:43:16.840 --> 02:43:20.520]  Koch Institute in Germany. Their scientists broke down the genetics of
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:25.640]  this E. coli strain. It's called O-104 and if you look at it you can read the
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:30.760]  history and the history doesn't lie. This strain was exposed repeatedly to all
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:35.560]  the eight major classes of antibiotics that are sold by the drug companies
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:41.600]  today. This practically guarantees that this is going to cause acute kidney
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:45.080]  failure. That it's going to cause fatalities in the hospitals and in
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:48.360]  fact this particular strain was engineered with a couple of extra genes
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:53.680]  that give it even more power. It's like a super powerful deadly super bug and the
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:58.440]  fact is Alex this could not have been created randomly in nature with some
[02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:03.400]  kind of random mutation. Impossible. It had to have been engineered and then
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:08.040]  introduced into the food supply in some way. I don't know where it was
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:11.160]  introduced. We don't know that yet. The story is still developing. I know you're
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:15.480]  covering it. Well it's like the anthrax. Years later it comes out. Super U.S.
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:19.760]  government weaponized. Three different pasties they tried to blame. The last
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:23.160]  guy they killed in custody and then that wasn't even a news item. It was buried
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:27.600]  that he died in custody. Oh he did it and it turned out it was U.S. government. It
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:31.240]  took hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment to even miniaturize it and
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:36.080]  they blamed it on Al Qaeda. I mean it never ends. I mean it's simple. We have
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:39.800]  a big criminal structure and anytime they want to shut an industry down or
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:43.680]  consolidate something they stage an event. I mean it wasn't hard to predict
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:47.360]  there'd be massive hack attacks against governments and industry right as they
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:52.160]  try to pass the total internet kill switch media takeover with government
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:56.240]  messages over your email and cell phone and magically it happens right as Obama
[02:44:56.240 --> 02:45:02.000]  is set to announce his assault weapons ban and gun show shut down legislation.
[02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:07.000]  The head of Al Qaeda pops out and says yes you have too many guns. Muslims get
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.120]  the guns and kill people go to the gun shows. I mean it's it's so ridiculously
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:18.160]  predictable. Well also because it's so effective the public who isn't aware of
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:21.160]  all this they don't understand the dynamics they don't know about problem
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:26.400]  reaction solution. They are so easily hoodwinked that this tactic works for the
[02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:30.040]  global elite. So of course they use it over and over again every time they want
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:34.240]  to pass a new regulation or clamp down on another freedom or convince people to
[02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:38.280]  be afraid of something they can simply engineer it and now the evidence of this
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:42.640]  engineering is in the genetic code of the E. Coli itself. You can't argue with
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:47.080]  that it's written in the DNA. Now why isn't the mainstream media reporting
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:51.560]  this? Well once again because they're on the side of the global elite who are
[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:55.600]  trying to fool people into thinking that fresh vegetables are harmful to you
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:59.280]  and that we need more food safety regulations and we need more clamping
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:03.720]  down on small organic farmers. That's the opposite of what we need. We need more
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:09.960]  local food, small organic farms and less processed mechanized factory made
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:15.440]  foods. And let's be clear why they get radiation radiating in the food past. Why
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:19.240]  the six years ago they got it passed to spray live viruses that quote eat the
[02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:23.680]  bacteria. They admit it so they can feed you rotten meat but radiate it so the
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:29.760]  bacteria aren't live but you still get the toxins they've excreted. They come
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:36.000]  out with the vaccines that they live vaccines of a virus bath and the name
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:41.280]  of the virus in Latin is translated as bacteria eating virus. The flanges they
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:45.600]  they spray those on there and if you're a new listener folks I'm not joking just
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:51.480]  search. FDA approves bacteria eating viruses to be sprayed on meat and then
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:56.160]  that gives rise to mutations just like antibiotics overuse makes the bacteria
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:00.120]  get more and more hearty but this one's had a bunch of stuff added to it out of
[02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:04.240]  the clear blue with the media then blaming all the organic farmers notice
[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:09.960]  no big agribusiness. It has all the telltale signs of the frame up and they
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:14.760]  just continue to do this Mike. It's horrible. Well a lot of people don't
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:19.160]  realize this has been going on for such a long time. For example you can't buy raw
[02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:22.880]  almonds grown in America anymore. I know you covered this Alex but some of your
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:27.480]  listeners may not be aware of it. The FDA and the California State Almond Board
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:32.680]  came in and said you have to fumigate or irradiate the almonds to effectively
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:37.640]  kill them before you can sell them to American consumers and why do they do
[02:47:37.640 --> 02:47:42.380]  that because raw almonds are a type of superfood. In fact they contain an
[02:47:42.380 --> 02:47:46.480]  anti-cancer element that's part of an anti-cancer formula used in Chinese
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:51.080]  medicine. So one by one they're going after the foods that can keep people
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:54.720]  healthy. They're banning the herbs in the EU and that's already a done deal
[02:47:54.720 --> 02:47:58.440]  banning the vitamins the supplements. By the way folks never believed us when we
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:02.920]  told them about Codex Alimentarius that was in the bill the food safety act last
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:06.240]  year. I mean people go well they wouldn't ban hundreds of over-the-counter
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:11.720]  vitamins and herbs. Yes they did. It's happening. Wake up folks. It is happening.
[02:48:11.720 --> 02:48:17.520]  It's week by week. We find another example of some outrageous accusation
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:22.120]  against supplements or herbs or organic foods. I mean the fact that this whole
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:27.600]  thing was blamed on Germany's organic sprout growers and that now that's
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:31.400]  completely false but the damage is done Alex. You know they can't retract that.
[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:35.200]  People all over Germany have stopped buying sprouts all over the UK. I mean
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:39.600]  this has affected ten nations in Europe and the authorities can just shout out
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:44.040]  a vegetable and everybody will stop buying it. Carrots. Oh all of a sudden no
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:48.640]  one's buying carrots anymore. Lettuce. No more lettuce. Spinach. No more spinach.
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:53.240]  I mean this this is economic warfare against the vegetables. And they know
[02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:57.200]  what they're doing. They just randomly move. They could go test in minutes and
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:01.320]  see if it's that E. Coli strain. They don't care. They know only every day
[02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:05.200]  throughout a new thing to scare everybody but don't worry. We've got GMO
[02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:08.280]  that's safe. We've got irradiated produce which they're now starting to do.
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:13.680]  Oh we've gassed all your produce with sodium fluoride gas. Everything's okay
[02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:17.880]  now. We've killed all the food so it's safe. We've taken that raw milk. We're
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:22.240]  taking that cheese from raw milk. We're taking all those vitamins and minerals
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:25.520]  from you and we're going to give you McDonald's food that doesn't even
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:30.640]  decompose when left on a plate for six months. Well and it's amazing too if they
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:34.520]  had not taken away raw milk people could drink the raw milk and get the
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.880]  probiotics from the raw milk which populate your intestinal flora which
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:43.080]  crowd out these dangerous E. Coli strains so raw milk can actually help
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:46.560]  protect you against these outbreaks. That's right. People eating all the studies show
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:50.360]  you're mentioning the bubble boy. You know he couldn't handle stuff from the
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:54.120]  outside. Well it's the opposite. People that have a dog or another animal it
[02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:58.520]  shows you get more buffer flora and are much healthier. It's the kids
[02:49:58.520 --> 02:50:01.440]  that play in the dirt that are healthier throughout life. That's right. All these
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:05.720]  people eating dead foods have dead stomachs and are wide open to invading
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:10.320]  bacteria. They're living more and more in a sterile environment. Even parents
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:13.600]  are afraid to have their kids go outside and touch the dirt. You know oh the
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:17.800]  evil dirt how terrible. Well other science shows that if you're in the dirt
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:21.640]  and you actually inhale some of the dirt microbes they increase your
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:25.360]  cognitive function. They make you smarter and they also boost your immune
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:30.040]  function. We need more probiotics. We need more living foods but instead the
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:34.160]  global elite they're just taking them away one by one destroying the markets.
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:38.280]  Do they know why breathing in dirt? As I saw that new scientists reported on that
[02:50:38.280 --> 02:50:44.080]  last year why breathing microbes in dirt makes you smarter. It triggers
[02:50:44.080 --> 02:50:48.600]  some enzyme reaction or the olfactory is excited by it and it causes neural
[02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:52.040]  connections to open. I know they're not they don't know why. I'm speculating Mike
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:56.560]  Adams naturalnews.com stay with us final segment straight ahead right here on the
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:51:03.080]  GCN Radio Network. A ton of key news at GCNLive.com. Will I have garlic breath
[02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:07.080]  after I take LEC? We get that question all the time about the world's best
[02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:12.680]  garlic extract LEC and the answer is LEC contains stabilized allicin, nature's
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:16.480]  antimicrobial agent and the active ingredient in crushed garlic but will
[02:51:16.480 --> 02:51:19.960]  not give you garlic breath. Scientifically proven in double-blind studies
[02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:24.160]  using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number severity and duration
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:28.600]  of common colds. Our powerful LEC contains 300 milligrams of stabilized
[02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:33.600]  allicin. Just one tablet of LEC is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves. It's
[02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:37.640]  effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal and viral infections and
[02:51:37.640 --> 02:51:41.480]  helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Plus it's a natural
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:45.000]  mosquito repellent. Boosts resistance to infection with nature's best garlic
[02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:52.080]  extract LEC. For more information then to order LEC call 877-888-7126 or go to

[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:15.120]  I want to remind new listeners that over 4,000 American foster children
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:22.560]  in the 1940s, 50s and 60s were radiated to death knowingly in radiation tests by
[02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:27.040]  the U.S. government. Europe did the same thing. Israel did the
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:29.520]  same thing. Israel, you know, to their children as
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:32.640]  well. You think Israel didn't care about
[02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:35.920]  mowing down Palestinians. They don't care about frying their own kids. Same
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:39.280]  thing with our government. You know about the syphilis and the
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:42.480]  black men shooting them up with it. Now you know about it in Latin America
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:46.960]  shooting the kids up. The U.N. constantly caught giving people polio
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:51.040]  claiming it's a vaccine. So of course they would release a
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:56.400]  weaponized a coli. In fact it even came out that back what was in 2001 or 2000
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:00.000]  the British government had done a drill and was the source of the weaponized
[02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:04.880]  foot and mouth. That was used to target and knock out
[02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:09.360]  so many of the farmers there. So yes these are ruthless killers
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:13.040]  who want a scientific dictatorship. There's very small numbers of them at the
[02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:17.680]  top who use the bureaucracy to carry this out.
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:21.360]  Remember Rick Perry trying to force Gardasil that they knew was killing
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:26.640]  girls in trials on the children of Texas. Folks we're
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:28.800]  not just here saying oh the government did this.
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:32.240]  We've learned to watch them. We've learned to study them. We've learned to see who
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:36.000]  they target. This is a hundred percent stage Mike Adams. Mike how
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:39.760]  long will they go on with the deaths in Germany and the deaths in Europe and
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:44.640]  the hyping government takeover of everything? Well they will try to milk
[02:55:44.640 --> 02:55:49.040]  this for as much play as they can get. They want to spread as much fear as
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:52.000]  possible so that they can come in with the reaction
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.760]  solution and have people call for more food regulations and of course
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:58.640]  they're going to crack down on the organic farms and the vegetable
[02:55:58.640 --> 02:56:02.800]  producers. And if this doesn't do what they want they'll just stage another one
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:08.000]  Alex. You know look if you get back to the genetic code of this strain of E. coli
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:11.840]  you have to ask who has the technical ability to create this
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:15.040]  because that will point you to who's doing it and it's really only the drug
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:18.160]  companies or the government infectious disease
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:22.240]  organizations such as the CDC in the United States.
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:25.600]  Similar organizations across Europe have that capacity.
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:29.680]  Maybe a university has the capacity but this is really more of an expert
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:33.360]  creation of a bioengineered strain of E. coli.
[02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:37.200]  Now if they do trace it back to a food something like lettuce let's say
[02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:40.560]  then you have to ask well how did it get in the lettuce? Well that's a simple
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:44.240]  matter. They could have taken dried E. coli powder
[02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:48.240]  and dropped it into a shipment of lettuce or dropped it into a shipment of
[02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:52.160]  seeds going to the sprouting company. They could have injected it into the
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:55.680]  food supply at any point so that they can target a specific
[02:56:55.680 --> 02:57:00.320]  food to blame for the outbreak. By the way British intelligence is
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:04.560]  saying Al Qaeda might be involved. No proof but maybe Adam
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:09.520]  Gadon will pop up and tell us he did it. Maybe Ben
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:12.720]  Laden did it Alex. Swam back out of the ocean and
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:15.840]  dropped some E. coli on the Germans. I mean who knows what they're going to come
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:18.960]  up with next. They could come up with anything and
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:22.160]  people would believe it. That's the thing. People are believing this in the
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:25.360]  mainstream but of course fortunately more and more people are
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:29.440]  waking up in the alternative media and realizing that that story doesn't make
[02:57:29.440 --> 02:57:31.360]  sense. The real story is the story that we're
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:35.040]  explaining here. This has been engineered. Well what's the tipping point though
[02:57:35.040 --> 02:57:38.800]  when the alternative becomes the mainstream? I see that beginning to
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:42.720]  happen and that's why the ruling establishment the social engineers are
[02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:46.160]  bum rushing society on every front. That's why old
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:50.000]  Hades is starting to break loose. They're attempting to create enough chaos
[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:53.520]  to pose as saviors to keep themselves in place.
[02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:56.480]  Yeah the tipping point is coming. More and more people are waking up and those
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:58:00.880]  who aren't are frankly dying from things like E. coli or from things like
[02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:03.600]  vaccines. I had a guy tell me recently hey he
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:08.480]  thinks vaccines are a global IQ test and those who fail the IQ test end up
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:11.920]  with infertility from vaccines or GMOs or fluoride.
[02:58:11.920 --> 02:58:16.160]  I mean that's that's one way to look at it. Not not my favorite way to look at it
[02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:20.800]  but they're testing people. Hey I was I was out this weekend in public
[02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:24.240]  and I was with my children at a restaurant it was packed
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:28.000]  and I was looking at children it was seven eight nine years old and they
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:31.840]  all talked like they were retarded and acted like they were retarded all
[02:58:31.840 --> 02:58:34.480]  mildly autistic and I was looking at everybody they
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:38.400]  were like hit by a mutation ray. Folks this is scary. Mike Adams thank you
[02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:43.600]  so much. Retransmission starts now. PrisonBlood.tv.
