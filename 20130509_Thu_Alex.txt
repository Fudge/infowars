[00:00.000 --> 00:12.120]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.120 --> 00:29.920]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.920 --> 00:36.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is yet another live worldwide transmission. I am your host, Alex
[00:36.380 --> 00:45.680]  Jones. It is Thursday, the ninth day of May, 2013. We've got Lord Christopher Monckton
[00:45.680 --> 00:54.220]  on Benghazi Gate, on the new pushes to get carbon taxes in place worldwide, UKIP's Ron
[00:54.220 --> 01:03.760]  Paul level victories over in the UK and Europe. Cody Wilson, all over the news, obviously,
[01:03.760 --> 01:10.640]  with the 22-caliber printable total gun, complete gun, multiple states moving to ban it right
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.640]  now.
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.780]  California, New York, and criminal command base, the Floating Fortress of Evil, District
[01:16.780 --> 01:22.320]  of Criminals. He's gonna be popping in as well. Godfrey Bloom, the head of UKIP, or
[01:22.320 --> 01:25.920]  one of the heads of UKIP, is gonna be coming on to talk about their victories against the
[01:25.920 --> 01:31.640]  globalists. He's gonna pop in, and then Dr. Steve Pachanik to get his take on Benghazi.
[01:31.640 --> 01:40.540]  At the end of the third hour today, the imperial furor, Obama, is scheduled to come into Austin
[01:40.540 --> 01:45.960]  today and shut down large parts of the city while he flies around above us in his Blackhawk
[01:45.960 --> 01:53.040]  helicopter. He's down here, reportedly, according to the Dallas Morning News, to expose the
[01:53.040 --> 01:58.880]  extremism of the Republican Party by connecting Texas to it.
[01:58.880 --> 02:05.240]  I'm not kidding. Senator Ted Cruz, who he's calling extreme, because Ted Cruz just calmly
[02:05.240 --> 02:10.480]  covers the Bill of Rights and Constitution, calmly calls them on their lies. Harry Reid
[02:10.480 --> 02:17.680]  is calling him a schoolyard bully. No, blaming all gun owners for 20 dead kids when crime
[02:17.680 --> 02:20.960]  rates dropped 49% violent crime.
[02:20.960 --> 02:27.080]  Gun woundings, 69%. And that's the new Justice Department numbers. Crime dropped even more
[02:27.080 --> 02:30.900]  than I had said crunching the numbers here at our office. I said 49. That was just one
[02:30.900 --> 02:36.800]  number. Crime with guns even more. And again, I just fall back on that because it just shows
[02:36.800 --> 02:39.380]  what frauds these people are.
[02:39.380 --> 02:48.560]  And then obviously the big, gigantic, massive enchilada, Benghazi game. You've got two different
[02:48.560 --> 02:52.880]  confirmed stand downs with State Department officials saying it's on record, releasing
[02:52.880 --> 02:59.380]  the classified emails. They don't dare arrest them because it's not a violation of national
[02:59.380 --> 03:02.840]  security to expose treason in government.
[03:02.840 --> 03:06.440]  And now it's coming out, they ordered the complete stand down. The ambassador had begged
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.280]  for security for weeks, intensified it in the days, knew they were being cased, saw
[03:11.280 --> 03:17.120]  most of the security leave. People that tried to get out early were carjacked and then weren't
[03:17.120 --> 03:18.200]  given support.
[03:18.200 --> 03:22.280]  The order was stand down, get these people out of the way. And again, people are like,
[03:22.280 --> 03:27.720]  this is such revelations. It's only revelations because it's government people admitting what
[03:27.720 --> 03:33.780]  was in the news in the first few weeks, all of this. And I tell you, the gigantic smoking
[03:33.780 --> 03:40.240]  gun is that the group that did this that was the protesters, imagine going and attacking
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.600]  the state capitol, hypothetically where you live, with 400 people, 200 at first, 400 then
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.920]  maybe 500, they're not sure, with artillery, grenade launchers, and heavy machine guns.
[03:51.920 --> 03:58.520]  And just say, hey, we're protesting. And then you just attack it with grenade launchers.
[03:58.520 --> 04:04.720]  I'm not saying do that, I'm saying this is the same thing. I mean, call it a protest.
[04:04.720 --> 04:08.960]  And they announced they're gonna call out the army on, you just say, what, it's a protest.
[04:08.960 --> 04:13.520]  Attacking Libya and overthrowing Gaddafi was called a protest. Two plus years of attacks
[04:13.520 --> 04:21.520]  going on now in Syria, car bombings, mass murder, our government openly running Al-Qaeda.
[04:21.520 --> 04:29.200]  That is now called protesting. I mean, I guess you could chop your wife up, cut her head
[04:29.200 --> 04:34.280]  off, throw her off a roof, blow up a local church and just say, hey, I'm protesting.
[04:34.280 --> 04:44.400]  And be like, they're protesting. Don't complain, Syria, don't complain, they're protesting.
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.800]  And so the over the topness of government corruption, hiding in plain view, has now
[04:48.800 --> 04:54.120]  reached bizarro squared. Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us. We'll be right back on the other
[04:54.120 --> 05:00.240]  side of this break. This could melt down the globalist.

[07:04.200 --> 07:09.320]  I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working. My body was literally starving
[07:09.320 --> 07:14.040]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that, I
[07:14.040 --> 07:19.440]  immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.280]  hundreds of great products at info-warstein.com but I want to point out the three that have

[08:02.640 --> 08:08.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:08.680 --> 08:21.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:21.920 --> 08:27.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you for joining us on this live Thursday edition.
[08:27.240 --> 08:33.200]  We'll be here for the next three hours. Lord willing, Lord Monckton, speaking of Lord willing,
[08:33.200 --> 08:38.800]  will be joining us to cover a host of issues dealing with globalism, Benghazi, the carbon
[08:38.800 --> 08:44.160]  taxes, big new initiatives by the global government and the fight against it. With Lord Monckton,
[08:44.160 --> 08:49.960]  Cody Wilson, the inventor now of the 3D printable.22 caliber handgun is going to be joining
[08:49.960 --> 08:55.740]  us. Fellow Austinite. And then at Godfrey Bloom, the head of UKIP, their big giant victory
[08:55.740 --> 09:00.920]  showing the best in the elections in the UK. It's parliamentary, so it's incremental. It's
[09:00.920 --> 09:04.120]  got the system absolutely scared to death.
[09:04.120 --> 09:09.200]  And the establishment now apologizing to UKIP trying to co-op them. That's when you know
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.480]  you've won is when they really start groveling. And then Dr. Steve Pacinek, I wanna get his
[09:14.480 --> 09:23.320]  take on Benghazi. I had Pacinek on the week of Benghazi last year. I had Colonel Anthony
[09:23.320 --> 09:29.240]  Shafer on, and we played some clips of this last night. And we laid out exactly what it
[09:29.240 --> 09:33.360]  was. We knew then it was an ordered stand down.
[09:33.360 --> 09:37.680]  And in the months after that it came out, it was a stand down. Of course, Obama wasn't
[09:37.680 --> 09:42.920]  asleep. Of course, Hillary knew. She says, well, what difference does it make why they're
[09:42.920 --> 09:49.440]  dead? Try that if you kill your wife or you kill your husband and you call the cops and
[09:49.440 --> 09:52.640]  they show up and they go, why is your wife stabbed to death in the bed?
[09:52.640 --> 09:59.440]  Did you do this? What difference does it make? What difference does it make? And this is
[09:59.440 --> 10:04.040]  about government being above the law. The district attorney of Travis County caught
[10:04.040 --> 10:09.760]  driving at three times the legal blood alcohol level on the wrong side of a highway almost
[10:09.760 --> 10:11.640]  killing people.
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.960]  She almost had a bunch of head on collisions. People called the cops. Right over there on
[10:16.960 --> 10:23.080]  the highway, right off of 620 right by Steiner Ranch. She's totally drunk on the footage
[10:23.080 --> 10:27.440]  and the Democrats are all saying, hey, let her stay in office. This is no big deal. Even
[10:27.440 --> 10:35.240]  though there's a law that a district attorney cannot ever be arrested for public intoxication.
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.440]  There's a law because people drink and there were issues with district attorneys strutting
[10:39.440 --> 10:43.320]  around drunk, threatening people in Texas history.
[10:43.320 --> 10:49.320]  You can look it up. Now she will do whatever she wants. And it's the same thing now with
[10:49.320 --> 10:53.840]  Benghazi. They will do what they want on this. They're saying Hillary's not gonna resign.
[10:53.840 --> 11:02.800]  Rice isn't gonna resign. They are caught red handed in two stand down orders that they
[11:02.800 --> 11:09.360]  then lied about. And five days after this happened, they had Rice in front of the UN
[11:09.360 --> 11:16.160]  and on all the news shows saying, remember this, saying there, ladies and gentlemen,
[11:16.160 --> 11:24.000]  there has not been one single piece of evidence this was a terror attack.
[11:24.000 --> 11:32.880]  And they said that over and over and over and over and over again. And you can pull
[11:32.880 --> 11:40.240]  up the headlines. They even said that it was a conspiracy theory that people were saying
[11:40.240 --> 11:45.700]  it was a terror attack. And they used some YouTube video that had been out for months
[11:45.700 --> 11:50.320]  that was strangely enough produced by a neo con FBI connected individual who they set
[11:50.320 --> 11:53.940]  up sent to prison so much for free speech in America.
[11:53.940 --> 11:58.480]  And then they hyped that trying to create riots in the Middle East to be the political
[11:58.480 --> 12:04.060]  distraction. A false flag just like Fast and Furious to be blamed on the Second Amendment
[12:04.060 --> 12:10.520]  and even though they got caught, CBS News caught, they still don't care. They're now
[12:10.520 --> 12:12.900]  blaming the Second Amendment with it.
[12:12.900 --> 12:24.720]  So we are here witnessing the unprecedented in modern history, open, naked, hand in the
[12:24.720 --> 12:30.760]  cookie jar staged event. And again, people are like, this is so incredible. We have all
[12:30.760 --> 12:38.160]  the breaking news, I say that in quotes, up on infowars.com, up on prisonplanet.com. We
[12:38.160 --> 12:39.400]  have it all up there.
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.960]  But if you go back to when this happened last year, how long it was Benghazi, eight months
[12:43.960 --> 12:54.640]  ago? Yeah, September 11th, 2012. So almost eight months ago.
[12:54.640 --> 12:59.620]  And now it's all breaking. No, it's not breaking. Every bit of this was actually even in mainstream
[12:59.620 --> 13:06.840]  news that the people that attacked, the mob that were called protesters. The protesters
[13:06.840 --> 13:14.280]  with the rocket launchers and artillery and anti aircraft guns and missiles that attacked
[13:14.280 --> 13:21.040]  knew all the internal procedures and highly classified information that only specialized
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.100]  State Department security groups are aware of.
[13:26.100 --> 13:32.540]  And that all came out because they were sent to kill everybody in that building. Because
[13:32.540 --> 13:38.760]  right behind that building was a giant warehouse full of, you can pull this up, the guys can
[13:38.760 --> 13:47.440]  pull it up for TV viewers. Type in jihadist or rebels, Libyan and Syrian rebels show off
[13:47.440 --> 13:57.720]  heat seeking missiles they got in Libya. Shoulder fired, point and shoot, heat seeking missiles.
[13:57.720 --> 14:01.680]  For somebody with about 20 minutes of training, just like a video game in an arcade at Dave
[14:01.680 --> 14:02.680]  and Busters.
[14:02.680 --> 14:08.320]  And they got games where you can fire heat seeking missiles, shoulder fired. It's the
[14:08.320 --> 14:13.520]  same thing, you turn it on, you aim through the reticle, it lights up. It says it's got
[14:13.520 --> 14:17.400]  a lock on the heat signature that you wanna aim at, cuz there might be a smokestack, you
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.240]  know, mile over here.
[14:19.240 --> 14:23.280]  You don't wanna aim at that and click and have it ready. And you don't want it to be
[14:23.280 --> 14:28.300]  on, let's say your own helicopter that's flying around. You want it to be on that passenger
[14:28.300 --> 14:32.800]  jet taking off. So the passenger jet takes off, it's at about 3,000, 4,000 feet, it's
[14:32.800 --> 14:33.800]  coming over you.
[14:33.800 --> 14:41.560]  You look at it, you lock on, right on its engine and you squeeze the trigger. You don't
[14:41.560 --> 14:50.280]  even have to aim. Missile goes right up, hits the engine, blows the wing off. Heat seeking
[14:50.280 --> 14:56.720]  missiles are missing from Libyan arms stockpile. What is that out of? New York Times.
[14:56.720 --> 15:06.040]  Yeah, show them the BBC headline though, the loving headline about Libyan rebels, Syrian
[15:06.040 --> 15:17.360]  rebels show off heat seeking missiles. That too is the New York Times. It's the New York
[15:17.360 --> 15:24.040]  Times being reposted to the Seattle Times. So ladies and gentlemen, this is what we're
[15:24.040 --> 15:25.480]  talking about here.
[15:25.480 --> 15:30.680]  And I have reporters call me up and they go, so you claim that the government put al-Qaeda
[15:30.680 --> 15:35.400]  in charge in Libya and Syria and gave them heat seeking missiles. No, I don't claim anything.
[15:35.400 --> 15:39.240]  I don't claim they've come out in the New York Times and said, the overhaul for your
[15:39.240 --> 15:41.880]  rights, we're gonna spy on you without warrants now.
[15:41.880 --> 15:46.480]  And by the way, we've been recording everything you say for a decade, everything, everything
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.840]  is recorded. And then they laugh at you on CNN and in the New York Times and say it's
[15:51.840 --> 15:57.440]  a good thing because they think you're broken back. They think there's nothing that you
[15:57.440 --> 16:03.720]  won't put up with. They think that it is basically over, but it's actually more than that. We
[16:03.720 --> 16:11.560]  are at the critical jump point crossroads right now in human civilization in society
[16:11.560 --> 16:17.040]  where there is a burgeoning giant real alternative media, bigger in the aggregate than the dying
[16:17.040 --> 16:24.480]  dinosaur corporatist, globalist, kleptocracy, crony capitalist, anti-free market, joker
[16:24.480 --> 16:33.800]  media, the sycophant media, the teleprompter reading media, the buggy whip media, the horse
[16:33.800 --> 16:38.680]  whip media, trying to contend with the Model T, it ain't happening.
[16:38.680 --> 16:43.080]  All the king's horses, all the king's men are not gonna put your fraud together again.
[16:43.080 --> 16:48.860]  No amount of Internet kill switches, no amount of setting nukes off and saying foreign enemies
[16:48.860 --> 16:56.920]  did it and trying to resurrect a new dark age. Nothing you do, nothing, nothing you
[16:56.920 --> 17:02.400]  pull, nothing you try, nothing you push, nothing will put the genie back in the bottle. Train
[17:02.400 --> 17:07.880]  left the station, horse left the barn, donkey ain't coming back.
[17:07.880 --> 17:11.960]  And the only question is, what are you gonna do about it? Well, they're gonna try to bring
[17:11.960 --> 17:18.640]  in a police state and shut down the alternative media and use spam filters to block alternative
[17:18.640 --> 17:26.760]  media and it's not gonna work. The people now know, the people now know. And that's
[17:26.760 --> 17:31.760]  why we're in so much danger is because the establishment is used to being in power.
[17:31.760 --> 17:37.400]  They're accustomed to getting away with anything and they are not gonna give up power. They
[17:37.400 --> 17:44.040]  are going to continue to go for it all. They are not going to give up easily and they are
[17:44.040 --> 17:53.800]  cornered rats. And that is why they are launching on every single front out there, a full scale
[17:53.800 --> 17:55.920]  desperate Battle of the Bulge event.
[17:55.920 --> 18:01.600]  You got the United States and Allied Forces coming in out of France, out of Normandy.
[18:01.600 --> 18:09.200]  They've now gotten up to the edge of the German border and you have an all out desperate Axis
[18:09.200 --> 18:18.400]  Nazi offensive with everything they had throwing it at the Allies. But they had untrained people
[18:18.400 --> 18:22.760]  in the tanks and in the weapons systems, even the weapons systems were better.
[18:22.760 --> 18:27.480]  And they didn't have the moral high ground. And they had the Russians on their other flank
[18:27.480 --> 18:35.800]  and they failed. And you had people like Zeb Dietrich and others leading SS Panzer groups
[18:35.800 --> 18:44.040]  drunk off their hind end, busy lining hookers up, lining up the local townswomen.
[18:44.040 --> 18:49.480]  And it was just an arrogance. Once an elite gets an arrogance, even if they have courage,
[18:49.480 --> 18:54.360]  they can't win. And it's all over. I mean, I don't know how bad it's gonna get, but it's
[18:54.360 --> 18:59.960]  all over for the new world order. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. But it's
[18:59.960 --> 19:02.400]  gonna get very, very nasty, it's gonna get very, very bad.
[19:02.400 --> 19:08.200]  I can also tell you, I talked to high powered reporters almost every day. I talked to government
[19:08.200 --> 19:13.400]  people, I talked to military brass, I talked to top generals retired. I talked to people
[19:13.400 --> 19:19.640]  and they apologized to me every day. And they say, wow, you really were right about all
[19:19.640 --> 19:20.640]  this.
[19:20.640 --> 19:26.000]  It's worse than you say, I can't believe it. And you see, once people are no longer naive,
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.880]  once people don't have their own cognitive dissonance, once people realize they've been
[19:29.880 --> 19:35.180]  wrong. Once people know how much trouble we're in, they're going to then see it all for themselves.
[19:35.180 --> 19:41.400]  It's not like people are tuning into Alex Jones's vision of the world.
[19:41.400 --> 19:50.080]  The White House on record ordered the stand down in Libya and pulled the security and
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.640]  then covered it up and lying about it. So they could transfer heat seeking missiles
[19:54.640 --> 20:02.500]  to Al Qaeda, who they hired as the head of security in Libya, period.
[20:02.500 --> 20:07.240]  Ceramic body armor is rated to stop six hits. But what about the seventh? Unlike ceramic
[20:07.240 --> 20:12.440]  or Kevlar, Infidel body armor is proven to take hit after hit and it just won't quit.

[20:30.400 --> 20:34.440]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[20:34.440 --> 20:38.660]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having a lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[20:38.660 --> 20:42.800]  to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[20:42.800 --> 20:46.320]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[20:46.320 --> 20:47.320]  army?

[24:06.500 --> 24:11.540]  punch up my screen, I'll show TV viewers what I'm looking at out of the Express newspaper
[24:11.540 --> 24:20.540]  in the UK. Age of consent should be lowered to 13. To stop persecution of old men's his
[24:20.540 --> 24:26.300]  top lawyer, top barrister. A top female barrister has sparked outrage after claiming the age
[24:26.300 --> 24:30.940]  of consent in Britain should be lowered to 13 in order to stop the persecution of old
[24:30.940 --> 24:38.000]  men in the wake of the Seville sex abuse scandal. By the way, Seville on record now with foster
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.800]  children, very small children under the age of 10, raping the daylights out of them in
[24:42.800 --> 24:47.600]  devil worship ceremonies. And in Florida, they're trying to change the law right now
[24:47.600 --> 24:53.800]  so they can. And the state is moving to let your 11 year olds have abortions. Some states
[24:53.800 --> 24:59.120]  have done that and also give them inoculations. In Texas, they want 14. I mean, it's a perverts
[24:59.120 --> 25:06.900]  world man. It is a perverts world. And this guy, of course, was top advisor to the Queen
[25:06.900 --> 25:14.380]  and Prince Charles and brag that he brought them special things. Yes, special things.
[25:14.380 --> 25:18.460]  Now it's just coming out the unbelievable feeding on children. That's what national
[25:18.460 --> 25:24.100]  security has always been used for. In every culture, there's maybe one tenth of 1% of
[25:24.100 --> 25:28.700]  the public that you could be described as vampires. They love to hurt children. They
[25:28.700 --> 25:33.980]  love to torture people. They love darkness. They always seek to get power to be above
[25:33.980 --> 25:38.740]  the law so that they can be protected from the town folks who would get the pitchforks
[25:38.740 --> 25:41.500]  and come to the castle and burn it down.
[25:41.500 --> 25:46.500]  And they call it lore. But if you study history, they would routinely burn down the castle
[25:46.500 --> 25:51.740]  in France or Transylvania or England, for that matter, saying the local lord had grabbed
[25:51.740 --> 25:58.660]  their children and eaten them or raped them. And you look at the Aztecs, the Mayans, the
[25:58.660 --> 26:08.020]  Babylonians, the the the Druids, every culture. Every culture sacrificed children in mass
[26:08.020 --> 26:14.220]  because these psycho groups, they want control, so they end up getting in control of government.
[26:14.220 --> 26:21.260]  And then within a few generations, it's always temples with children being cut up and raped
[26:21.260 --> 26:28.780]  in public and or a lot of cultures like to get fires going. The Northern Europeans did
[26:28.780 --> 26:35.540]  this. The Druids did this all over Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Northern Europe.
[26:35.540 --> 26:40.940]  What is England today, UK? By the way, you can look this up if you're a new listener.
[26:40.940 --> 26:45.700]  They liked having big altars and burning small babies on them. Well, their favorite was also
[26:45.700 --> 26:50.140]  five, six, seven, because they believe the gods like the begging and the screaming. So
[26:50.140 --> 26:53.540]  they would tell you to oppose to and burn you. That's why the Middle Ages witch burning
[26:53.540 --> 26:58.980]  was just a continuation of something they like to do.
[26:58.980 --> 27:02.420]  And just for new reasons now, if you practiced alternative medicine, they would call you
[27:02.420 --> 27:06.800]  a witch and burn you. Turned out it was satanic cults actually posing a lot of times as people
[27:06.800 --> 27:12.580]  in the church that were getting their kicks via that and also raping and torturing whoever
[27:12.580 --> 27:14.120]  they wanted to see.
[27:14.120 --> 27:20.140]  It's not really a destination. It's a journey. The destination is the journey. It's getting
[27:20.140 --> 27:25.780]  there. That's fun. This is the adventure. And it's about one half of one percent that
[27:25.780 --> 27:33.640]  I would call flaming children of Satan who like torturing small children. And, you know,
[27:33.640 --> 27:37.700]  they need a national security arm. They need a homeland security. How many homeland security
[27:37.700 --> 27:41.800]  people have been busted by their own colleagues?
[27:41.800 --> 27:46.820]  It's got to be over 100 now. I see a new one every week or so at the highest and then even
[27:46.820 --> 27:56.260]  lowest levels with small children in devil worship cults raping people. This is what
[27:56.260 --> 28:01.980]  they do. This is what they do. This is what they're into. You know, it came out with Bill
[28:01.980 --> 28:06.180]  Clinton that I guess, you know, he's not as dark as some.
[28:06.180 --> 28:13.220]  He likes to get his thing as hot blondes. Good looking bombshell blondes, voluptuous
[28:13.220 --> 28:17.820]  blondes. If this came out, they settled court cases on this and he likes to get them in
[28:17.820 --> 28:23.540]  a room. And he'll slap them on their ear, on the side of their head so there's not a
[28:23.540 --> 28:24.540]  mark.
[28:24.540 --> 28:30.420]  He'll slap him upside the head and then grab them by the throat. Please come in my office,
[28:30.420 --> 28:36.940]  please. And he slaps him upside the head and then grabs him on the throat. And he says,
[28:36.940 --> 28:41.220]  take your pants off. And if they whimper anyway, he goes, listen, it's okay, I'm gonna kiss
[28:41.220 --> 28:42.220]  you.
[28:42.220 --> 28:48.160]  And he bites them on the lip, kind of like a badger. And until they bleed, snarling
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.900]  with spit coming out of his mouth while he rapes them. And he pins them down biting them.
[28:52.900 --> 29:06.420]  Someone's like a ring in a bull's nose. He's a loving person. See, he doesn't like having
[29:06.420 --> 29:14.200]  the sex, he likes the raping. And so they wanna rape you, they wanna rape your bank
[29:14.200 --> 29:16.000]  account, they wanna rape your future.
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.380]  They are raping your health with GMO, the vaccines, all of it. And you see they're doing
[29:20.380 --> 29:29.460]  it cuz they like it. And all of you that are naive are letting these people, these pedophile
[29:29.460 --> 29:35.500]  armies get away with what they're doing. Pedophile armies with nuclear weapons. The media makes
[29:35.500 --> 29:37.380]  a joke out of that, that's not a joke.
[29:37.380 --> 29:42.900]  The UN everywhere, you don't get in the UN army, this has come out in court hearings,
[29:42.900 --> 29:47.500]  in an officer position unless you're a pedophile. I mean, that's who they are. It is an army
[29:47.500 --> 29:49.980]  of devil worshiping pedophiles, we'll be right back.
[29:49.980 --> 29:56.980]  There on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.980 --> 30:01.660]  Thank you.

[31:06.160 --> 31:11.500]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[31:11.500 --> 31:15.740]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[31:15.740 --> 31:20.940]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.

[33:27.980 --> 33:38.980]  I knew too much. I just knew too much. Does that make me crazy? Does that make me crazy?
[33:38.980 --> 33:51.980]  Does that make you crazy? Does that make us crazy? Possibly. Because when you're in a
[33:51.980 --> 34:01.820]  culture of people that have been incrementally trained to accept incredible tyranny, people
[34:01.820 --> 34:06.940]  that are awake and aware are the bad guys. In a world of universal deceit, telling the
[34:06.940 --> 34:14.500]  truth is a revolutionary act. Eric Blair, aka George Arwell. And you know, I read mainstream
[34:14.500 --> 34:19.640]  British newspapers going, hey, you know, we've got this issue with these secret guilds of
[34:19.640 --> 34:23.900]  old men with little kids. Let's just legalize it.
[34:23.900 --> 34:30.700]  Hey, why not let your 10 year old sign contracts to sell out their future? Why not let them
[34:30.700 --> 34:35.580]  have abortions without telling you? Why not let them take vaccines? You're doing all that.
[34:35.580 --> 34:44.900]  And who's doing it? The dirtbag state saying the kids belong to them. That's why I just
[34:44.900 --> 34:50.260]  saw that article up on Infowars.com. And I linked through to the newspaper and it's just
[34:50.260 --> 34:52.620]  so upsetting.
[34:52.620 --> 34:59.940]  To know that we're right about this, that historically history is repeating itself.
[34:59.940 --> 35:09.220]  And to know that it's these guilds of crooks that are infiltrating every institution. And
[35:09.220 --> 35:23.820]  that our naivete and our passiveness is the ether in which they swim. I'm going to get
[35:23.820 --> 35:30.040]  into Benghazi. I'm going to try to really crystallize Benghazi here. And then I want
[35:30.040 --> 35:33.540]  to get into what's happening economically.
[35:33.540 --> 35:36.980]  I want to really try to get into some of the other Second Amendment news I've got here
[35:36.980 --> 35:41.820]  in front of me. And then we have a loaded raft of guests. But I also want to give folks
[35:41.820 --> 35:54.420]  a chance. Listeners, I want to hear from you. What do you think about Benghazi? 800-259-9231.
[35:54.420 --> 36:02.860]  And we will get you up and on the air here today. 800-259-9231. Do you think that this
[36:02.860 --> 36:08.420]  will bring down the system or at least bring down the Obominoids and at least create some
[36:08.420 --> 36:12.220]  fear in criminals and government that lying could get them caught?
[36:12.220 --> 36:16.120]  Stuff like this is very healthy what's happening. Or will it just be something Republicans score
[36:16.120 --> 36:22.340]  points with, but don't actually restore liberty with? Let me tell you, the crooks in Washington,
[36:22.340 --> 36:26.700]  they're not all crooks, but most of them are. And the higher you get, the more the percentage
[36:26.700 --> 36:34.100]  is, they do not want to open the real can of worms.
[36:34.100 --> 36:38.700]  Because if Obama and his people start going down, they're gonna start releasing all the
[36:38.700 --> 36:44.880]  info they know. What do you think the NSA is for? What do you think all these spy grids
[36:44.880 --> 36:50.340]  are for? It's so that they've got data mines they can go into every recording, every phone
[36:50.340 --> 36:53.940]  call, everything. They've been going on for decades. They now admit the last ten years
[36:53.940 --> 36:56.620]  or so.
[36:56.620 --> 37:01.100]  Everything you've done the last 20 years is recorded by these criminals. Every time they
[37:01.100 --> 37:06.400]  did it, it was a felony. And again, it wasn't to keep you safe from Al-Qaeda. These criminals
[37:06.400 --> 37:12.020]  run Al-Qaeda. You're saying the firefighters on 9-11 did it? No, that's what you said,
[37:12.020 --> 37:21.780]  Hearst Publishing. The Global Crime Syndicate inside our government did that. That's what
[37:21.780 --> 37:29.460]  tyrants do. 800-259-931, but I wanna talk about the human revolt against tyranny and
[37:29.460 --> 37:31.600]  then I'm gonna get into Benghazi and your phone calls.
[37:31.600 --> 37:38.420]  But first off, this is a news piece slash produced promo ad. It's part ad, part, I guess
[37:38.420 --> 37:43.480]  you call it infomercial. But it really is something near and dear to my heart. I wanna
[37:43.480 --> 37:49.120]  have a rebellion against Monsanto. A rebellion against them trying, Europe right now is trying
[37:49.120 --> 37:52.720]  to ban non-hybrid heirloom seeds.
[37:52.720 --> 37:56.900]  That's mainstream news. I mean, this is Twilight Zone. And you think, well, Europe's where
[37:56.900 --> 38:03.220]  they're fighting GMO. No, they're doing an end run around it, saying, well, you can't
[38:03.220 --> 38:08.460]  sell these because it can't be taxed. They want a farming tax, just like a property tax
[38:08.460 --> 38:11.220]  is a feudal tax. All of this is about control.
[38:11.220 --> 38:15.800]  Cuz if the globalists don't keep you down, you'll build your own systems, and then they
[38:15.800 --> 38:22.360]  won't be in control anymore. They're threatened by Renaissance enlightenment. They are the
[38:22.360 --> 38:28.160]  old staid dark age trying to reassert itself. The New World Order is the old world order.
[38:28.160 --> 38:35.220]  We are Renaissance. You are Renaissance. We must live the Renaissance. We must struggle
[38:35.220 --> 38:40.360]  against the guilds. We must struggle against centralization. We must create real local
[38:40.360 --> 38:45.220]  communities and real sustainability to counter their false sustainability.
[38:45.220 --> 38:49.440]  People say, why are you always going interviewing sustainable farmers and sustainable horticulture
[38:49.440 --> 38:55.380]  and sustainable aquaponics? And why are you always going and interviewing co-ops? That's
[38:55.380 --> 39:01.860]  communism. No, it's not. Having millions of people forced off their land into giant slave
[39:01.860 --> 39:08.780]  camps is communism. Co-ops are humans working together. Everything good they've made counterfeits
[39:08.780 --> 39:18.420]  and stuff. Another big piece tonight about co-ops and horticulture and just everything.
[39:18.420 --> 39:22.380]  There it is, European Commission to criminalize nearly all seeds and plants not registered
[39:22.380 --> 39:27.160]  with government. And then the registering is so expensive, all these thousands of old
[39:27.160 --> 39:33.440]  varieties of things that no one can even get it certified. So then it's outlawed. Unbelievable,
[39:33.440 --> 39:34.760]  that's natural news.
[39:34.760 --> 39:41.800]  But let's first go to this piece. This operation. Johnny Appleseed, let's go to this piece,
[39:41.800 --> 39:47.100]  then I'm going to get to some really exciting news, something that is the key to victory
[39:47.100 --> 39:52.480]  against tyrants. But here's that piece. Many anthropologists and archaeologists believe
[39:52.480 --> 39:59.120]  that before man even discovered the power to harness and use fire, we were involved
[39:59.120 --> 40:05.180]  in agrarian activities. That is taking the seeds of plants and then replanting them to
[40:05.180 --> 40:11.620]  produce more. The very foundation of our modern civilization and human culture is centered
[40:11.620 --> 40:18.820]  around the planting and cultivation of edible plants, fruits, vegetables, nuts, you name
[40:18.820 --> 40:23.060]  it. And the globalist have been going after gardening. They've been harassing people that
[40:23.060 --> 40:27.200]  have gardens in their front yards or their backyards. They've called for licenses for
[40:27.200 --> 40:32.580]  people to have gardens because you can't trust prisoners in the police state America to be
[40:32.580 --> 40:34.480]  able to grow their own food.
[40:34.480 --> 40:38.680]  That's why I've come to the realization that we need to become self-sufficient. You need
[40:38.680 --> 40:41.840]  to be informed. You need to have the Second Amendment to protect yourself. You need to
[40:41.840 --> 40:47.080]  be politically active to wake up others. You need to filter your water, but you also need
[40:47.080 --> 40:50.760]  to plant a garden. Even if you live in an apartment, you can do this. If you live in
[40:50.760 --> 40:56.080]  the countryside, obviously you can do it on a grand scale. There are so many green belts
[40:56.080 --> 41:02.240]  and areas that humans don't even visit nearby cities and in suburbs where people are now
[41:02.240 --> 41:08.800]  more and more planting their own little private gardens and meadows and off the side of the
[41:08.800 --> 41:09.800]  road.
[41:09.800 --> 41:15.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a revolutionary act to unplug from the television, to unplug
[41:15.200 --> 41:19.880]  from the computer and all the globalist propaganda and to go out in your backyard or your front
[41:19.880 --> 41:24.640]  yard or planners at your apartment or on the roof of the building where you live and to
[41:24.640 --> 41:26.200]  plant a garden.
[41:54.640 --> 42:00.800]  Longevity, a deluxe emergency seed bank combines three of emergency seed banks top sellers,
[42:00.800 --> 42:06.160]  the family survival emergency seed bank, the medicinal herb seeds pack and the culinary
[42:06.160 --> 42:12.320]  herb seeds pack. We also have starter varieties of the deluxe seed packages for fruit, salad,

[43:06.080 --> 43:11.680]  Incidentally I held back a little more than 1000 of the May magazine. It sold out faster
[43:11.680 --> 43:16.840]  than any other magazine we've put out. Next time I'm going to print like 160, 70,000 instead
[43:16.840 --> 43:23.400]  of 120,000. So we've held back. Now there's like less than 1000 left. They have the three
[43:23.400 --> 43:27.400]  free bumper stickers in them to help get the word out and wake up others. So get the May
[43:27.400 --> 43:34.080]  false flag Boston bombing special double cover issue at Infowarsstore.com as well and get
[43:34.080 --> 43:39.640]  the pro pure water filter 10% off promo code water as well at Infowarsstore.com. And also
[43:39.640 --> 43:44.040]  be sure and support our local AM&FM affiliates by supporting their local sponsors and spreading
[43:44.040 --> 43:48.240]  the word about their broadcast or becoming sponsors as well.
[43:48.240 --> 43:52.640]  Now I'm going to go to people's calls on the Benghazi front here in a moment. But first
[43:52.640 --> 43:59.480]  I wanted to get into the spirit of resistance against hypocrisy and corruption. Here is
[43:59.480 --> 44:03.160]  an article. I'm going to talk about this with Lord Moncton when he joins us later in the
[44:03.160 --> 44:10.280]  next hour. Prince Charles attacks global warming skeptics. Prince uses speech at St. James
[44:10.280 --> 44:17.200]  palace palace to single out confirmed skeptics like it's dirty, like like he sets the rules
[44:17.200 --> 44:19.800]  and environmentally unfriendly businesses.
[44:19.800 --> 44:24.360]  That means things not owned by him. This is a guy that has his own private train, more
[44:24.360 --> 44:31.080]  than 20 aircraft and more than 30 palaces himself or something like 400 royal palaces
[44:31.080 --> 44:36.920]  in England, Wales and Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some of the palaces have more than
[44:36.920 --> 44:42.440]  a. Guys, pull up the biggest palace. How many rooms? I want to say a thousand, but I'm going
[44:42.440 --> 44:46.740]  from memory on that. Some so-called palaces are up to 100 square miles.
[44:46.740 --> 44:51.480]  That is the land around them. So they're their own self-contained cities with generational
[44:51.480 --> 44:56.200]  families that live there as minions disconnected from reality under these people. You can pull
[44:56.200 --> 45:03.880]  up an article. Prince Charles says the old should not take hot baths. And pensioners
[45:03.880 --> 45:08.880]  should have their their natural gas allotment cut, but then they use government pension
[45:08.880 --> 45:09.880]  funds.
[45:09.880 --> 45:15.520]  You can look all this up to to heat the palaces. There were articles about old people last
[45:15.520 --> 45:21.240]  year in England with their gas allotment cut off, driving around in buses with a bus ticket
[45:21.240 --> 45:27.380]  through the night so they wouldn't freeze to death. This is a guy who's a eugenicist
[45:27.380 --> 45:32.020]  who thinks you shouldn't have a standard of living, but he can live in palaces everywhere.
[45:32.020 --> 45:35.080]  So here's the article, Prince Charles. We're gonna talk about that with Lord Monckton.
[45:35.080 --> 45:41.240]  I'm gonna pull those articles up. If you're a new listener, I'm not joking. They've said
[45:41.240 --> 45:47.880]  Britons including old people should not take hot showers or baths, okay? I mean, this is
[45:47.880 --> 45:48.880]  total hypocrisy.
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.220]  Look at this article on the London Guardian as well. Chinese officials sacked after citizen
[45:53.220 --> 46:00.220]  journalist exposes extravagant banquet. He bust in on a cop banquet in a city with starving
[46:00.220 --> 46:06.400]  people. They have thousands of riots a month now in China, conservatively thousands. The
[46:06.400 --> 46:11.680]  people are fighting back and he bust in to show them with the most expensive wine and
[46:11.680 --> 46:14.400]  rare cuz the elite always likes to eat rare things.
[46:14.400 --> 46:21.080]  Rare eel, endangered species, you name it. The police in there in lavish party banquets,
[46:21.080 --> 46:26.580]  and guess what? They have now fired them. Now I wanna go to this next piece to show
[46:26.580 --> 46:36.040]  you what people can do exposing the hypocrisy. This has made big news with the little boy
[46:36.040 --> 46:45.160]  out in Las Vegas, Nevada who saw the cop drive on the sidewalk to go and get a soft drink.
[46:45.160 --> 46:48.000]  I'm gonna play that report and then comment on it after.
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.140]  But calling out hypocrisy and letting, quotes, government servants, officials know that they're
[46:54.140 --> 47:00.880]  not God is what is going to get the bad ones out so there's only good ones in there. And
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.280]  so this is the attitude in China and here in America and other places of exposing the
[47:05.280 --> 47:06.500]  hypocrisy.
[47:06.500 --> 47:13.000]  This is what will bring them down. Let's go to this clip. A 12 year old boy in Las Vegas,
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.480]  Nevada did what all American adults need to be doing to keep our out of control government
[47:19.480 --> 47:25.280]  in check. He saw a police officer pull up on the sidewalk, go into a store to get a
[47:25.280 --> 47:28.320]  soft drink, and then waddle out.
[47:28.320 --> 47:32.600]  If a citizen would have done that, the cop would have written him a ticket or maybe even
[47:32.600 --> 47:38.160]  arrested them. We've seen many cases of people parking on the sidewalk and being arrested.
[47:38.160 --> 47:44.760]  And he says to the police officer, the public servant, are you responding to an emergency?
[47:44.760 --> 47:50.760]  Because you just pulled up here on the sidewalk and the cop says, what are you a lawyer? Let
[47:50.760 --> 47:56.880]  me see your ID. He turns it around and that's what government does. It makes us all suspects
[47:56.880 --> 48:01.760]  under Homeland Security, under the fake war on terror and the fake war on drugs.
[48:01.760 --> 48:06.940]  And we never look at who the real suspect for corruption and tyranny is in history that
[48:06.940 --> 48:12.200]  our founding fathers warned us of, government and government servants. Because throughout
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.840]  history and in modern times, it is government that gets out of control and begins to dominate
[48:17.840 --> 48:19.200]  the population.
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.680]  So we wanted to show you this video. The young man shot the video sideways, so we're flipping
[48:23.680 --> 48:30.600]  it right side up so you can see it and follow along with it. But it's just an incredible
[48:30.600 --> 48:36.760]  illustration of how out of touch our government servants are that he would try to intimidate
[48:36.760 --> 48:41.720]  the boy, claim that he was loitering, claim that he'd done something wrong, claim that
[48:41.720 --> 48:48.280]  he needed to prove who he was and wouldn't give the young man his badge number, which
[48:48.280 --> 48:52.520]  by the way is the state law there in Nevada and most other states that are supposed to
[48:52.520 --> 48:53.520]  do that.
[48:53.520 --> 48:58.880]  So you have a cop breaking the law on multiple fronts for his convenience and then trying
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.840]  to treat the boy like he was some type of surfer slave. But within this is the essence
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.980]  of how we're gonna save our society. Because most adults I know don't understand that cops
[49:08.980 --> 49:12.240]  can't do that unless there's an emergency.
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.960]  Most people don't understand that they have no responsibility to ID themselves to a police
[49:16.960 --> 49:21.680]  officer even though they claim that you have a responsibility to and have a lot of fake
[49:21.680 --> 49:28.040]  laws that have been overturned still on the books. So I wanna salute this young man and
[49:28.040 --> 49:34.800]  I wanna challenge adults out there to do what he's done and stand up to this type of tyranny.
[49:34.800 --> 49:48.520]  Um, hello. Is there a reason for you to park on the sidewalk? Is it like an emergency or
[49:48.520 --> 49:49.520]  anything?
[49:49.520 --> 49:50.520]  Because I can.
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.560]  Oh. Can I see your badge number?
[49:52.560 --> 49:53.560]  Why?
[49:53.560 --> 49:56.200]  Uh, because I have the right to.
[49:56.200 --> 49:58.200]  You do, huh?
[49:58.200 --> 49:59.200]  Yeah.
[49:59.200 --> 50:01.200]  Are you a junior lawyer?
[50:01.200 --> 50:14.560]  No, I just wanna see your badge number. Can I please see your badge number?
[50:14.560 --> 50:15.560]  No.
[50:15.560 --> 50:16.560]  Really?
[50:16.560 --> 50:36.560]  Huh? No, I'm, I'm, uh, minor. I'm Jeremy Drew. I'm Jeremy. I don't know. I don't know, but
[50:36.560 --> 50:45.560]  is it an emergency why you can park a motorized vehicle on the sidewalk?
[50:45.560 --> 50:52.560]  Um, because I don't think it's necessary to park your motorized vehicle on the sidewalk.
[50:52.560 --> 50:54.560]  No, I'm actually mailing this.
[50:54.560 --> 50:55.560]  Huh?
[50:55.560 --> 50:56.560]  I'm filming.
[50:56.560 --> 50:57.560]  Yeah.
[50:57.560 --> 51:15.640]  All right. Well, can I see your badge number? No? All right.
[51:15.640 --> 51:23.000]  So we salute you, Jeremy Drew. May you a 12 year old man. You are a man. Encourage other
[51:23.000 --> 51:30.320]  men who have abdicated over their responsibility to stand up for the liberties and rights that
[51:30.320 --> 51:36.360]  our forebears fought so hard to secure. And in closing, as a news man, as a talk show
[51:36.360 --> 51:41.080]  host who travels the country and talks to a lot of people and focuses on the news, I'm
[51:41.080 --> 51:46.180]  here to tell you America and the world itself is waking up to government arrogance and red
[51:46.180 --> 51:48.800]  carpet hypocrisy.
[51:48.800 --> 51:52.920]  And the people aren't going to put up with the tyranny much longer. Look at Benghazi,
[51:52.920 --> 51:57.080]  look at fast and furious. Look at so many other examples, the billions of bullets they've
[51:57.080 --> 52:01.160]  been caught buying on the armored vehicles and the training to take on the American people
[52:01.160 --> 52:09.000]  in a civil war. We don't just buy your denials and lies anymore. The sleeping giant has awoken
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.280]  now back to info wars, nightly news and Rob do.
[52:13.280 --> 52:20.600]  Okay, that was commentary I did last night on info wars, nightly news. And that's the
[52:20.600 --> 52:23.960]  type of stuff we cover every night at seven o'clock central. I skipped this network break
[52:23.960 --> 52:29.960]  so I can get to your calls on the Benghazi situation. It's just that whether it's in
[52:29.960 --> 52:35.000]  China or the United States or England, where they actually pulled it up.
[52:35.000 --> 52:44.780]  There are some British palaces with over 2000 rooms. So when I said 1000 rooms, it was more
[52:44.780 --> 52:50.120]  than that. And the communist Chinese former royal palace there in the Forbidden City has
[52:50.120 --> 52:58.320]  more than 9000 rooms, just in one part of it. So the elites can have their 9000 rooms
[52:58.320 --> 53:01.880]  and they're walled off cities filled with basically sex slaves they grab out of the
[53:01.880 --> 53:06.880]  towns outside, but you can't have a hot shower.
[53:06.880 --> 53:11.360]  There it is Daily Mail, one must take shorter showers says Prince Charles. Prince Arches
[53:11.360 --> 53:17.720]  British families to snub the bathtub, not take hot showers. See anything I say you can
[53:17.720 --> 53:22.040]  pull up. Literally it's incredible all the stuff they do. Queen of England, it turned
[53:22.040 --> 53:25.200]  out was getting billions of pounds in the last decade.
[53:25.200 --> 53:31.240]  This came out like five years ago to heat her palaces and they were taking the gas allowance
[53:31.240 --> 53:35.480]  for poor people and England gets cold folks. They didn't have money for poor people to
[53:35.480 --> 53:44.720]  have gas. They had it though for the queen to heat palaces no one was in.
[53:44.720 --> 53:51.360]  But he says you shouldn't take a hot bath. When England has more water than probably
[53:51.360 --> 53:55.800]  any other country in Europe. I mean, they're not trying to charge for water there. Not
[53:55.800 --> 53:59.060]  for the service, the water itself when they have water coming out their ears. That's the
[53:59.060 --> 54:04.840]  type of stuff I'm talking about here. And then now with Benghazi.
[54:04.840 --> 54:10.080]  Now with Benghazi, again, I'm not tooting my horn, but I don't even really want to cover
[54:10.080 --> 54:15.500]  it because I mean, what's the point? There it is the queen pleads poverty, Royal AIDS
[54:15.500 --> 54:21.320]  asked ministers for help with palace heating bill.
[54:21.320 --> 54:25.440]  That was just 15 million pounds for one palace. You can actually find the multi billion dollar
[54:25.440 --> 54:31.680]  or billion pound, excuse me, article. That was Daily Mail as well. Now, expanding on
[54:31.680 --> 54:38.560]  all of this, but you need to go with less. Obama says, you're making $125,000 a year,
[54:38.560 --> 54:43.080]  you're rich, you need to pay more taxes. But he pays 18% tax, the average middle class
[54:43.080 --> 54:49.640]  person pays over 40 federal tax, we count social security on top of it, FICA.
[54:49.640 --> 54:52.400]  And then the big money guys, the billionaires are basically all exempt because they write
[54:52.400 --> 54:59.400]  the laws, but that's okay, cuz Obama spends 100 million per vacation. Biden, it's something
[54:59.400 --> 55:06.280]  like 50 million, you can pull it up. $100 million so that teleprompter reading Harvard
[55:06.280 --> 55:15.200]  whore lawyer can have the trendies all lust after him.
[55:15.200 --> 55:22.040]  I'm telling you if GQ magazine told their readers it was trendy to shoot themselves
[55:22.040 --> 55:28.040]  in the head, they'd do it. I mean, hell, they got Gloria Steinem saying it's sexy to kill
[55:28.040 --> 55:32.920]  your kid. I had an abortion and women are wearing them going, it's fun, it's my right.
[55:32.920 --> 55:41.160]  And they get into it like, yeah, damn it, it's smart. And it's the same culture. These
[55:41.160 --> 55:45.400]  are nothing but decadent slime bags begging for society to collapse. Criminals want things
[55:45.400 --> 55:46.400]  to collapse.
[55:46.400 --> 55:49.960]  They wanna be caught at a subconscious level. Okay, I'm gonna go to your phone calls. The
[55:49.960 --> 55:54.440]  question is, will Republicans just say it's a screw up, resign Hillary? Like, may they
[55:54.440 --> 56:01.200]  get tough and call for resignation? How about her arrest? Something like this could bring
[56:01.200 --> 56:03.680]  down the whole national security fraud system.
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.780]  Hey, they go or we all go. They go or your pension funds are gone. They're gonna take
[56:08.780 --> 56:16.600]  everything because they like to do it. It's their nature. Don't get in a pit with 15 cobras,
[56:16.600 --> 56:23.880]  you're gonna get bit. We either deal with them. It's us or them. I mean, I talk to reporters
[56:23.880 --> 56:26.560]  now and I just go, I'm not gonna try to convince you a jack squat.
[56:26.560 --> 56:29.720]  What planet are you living on to not know we're in deep trouble? They're all over the
[56:29.720 --> 56:34.900]  news saying they've recorded everything we've said and done for ten years illegally. And
[56:34.900 --> 56:43.420]  they're smiling in our face. Every major vaccine has been found to have cancer virus, nanotech
[56:43.420 --> 56:52.040]  packets in it. I call it nanotech. They're engineered, long term, frozen, packed RNA
[56:52.040 --> 56:57.640]  into DNA fragments to be activated by hormonal fluctuations in the body.
[56:57.640 --> 57:02.440]  They're implanting us with soft kill bio weapons. And I'm supposed to sit here and back off
[57:02.440 --> 57:06.040]  what I'm saying. I'm supposed to sit here and mince words. I'm supposed to sit here
[57:06.040 --> 57:15.520]  and play patty cake with everyone. Alex in San Diego on Benghazi, go ahead.
[57:15.520 --> 57:19.760]  I'm all right, sir. I took my shots this morning, go ahead.
[57:19.760 --> 57:27.040]  Alex, I was just calling to actually bring up something real quick. I was too late to
[57:27.040 --> 57:30.240]  bring up that, I'm so sorry, I'm so nervous right now.
[57:30.240 --> 57:33.600]  Just drink some fluoride, man, come on.
[57:33.600 --> 57:39.360]  Alex, I was gonna mention the Republican logo, actually, real quick, and the stars-
[57:39.360 --> 57:42.360]  Yeah, it used to be the stars were up, now the stars are upside down, yeah.
[57:42.360 --> 57:46.400]  Yeah, I mean, that is something I think you should tackle. I mean, ask Ron Paul how he
[57:46.400 --> 57:51.040]  feels about that and other Republicans. I mean, everything on flags and logos have meaning.
[57:51.040 --> 57:55.280]  Yeah, no, I wouldn't, well, it doesn't mean he's part of it cuz the RNC flipped it five
[57:55.280 --> 57:59.600]  years ago or six years ago. I mean, it's just all part of they think. They're saying we
[57:59.600 --> 58:05.480]  get negative power out of flipping. The star is the human body, the head, the arms, the
[58:05.480 --> 58:08.520]  legs, it's just a symbol of empowering humanity.
[58:08.520 --> 58:12.680]  It's an ancient symbol, a symbol of the stars, saying we came from the stars. That's the
[58:12.680 --> 58:21.920]  5,000-year-old Egyptian equation of 666 sundial, okay? Now, they flip it upside down and say,
[58:21.920 --> 58:27.360]  we have dark power. That's all it is, is a bunch of wimps calling on satanic power, calling
[58:27.360 --> 58:33.120]  to be absolutely crushed, calling for Stargate of Hell to open and swallow their soul into
[58:33.120 --> 58:43.320]  the ninth dimension. All right, ladies and gentlemen, checkin' out, we're comin' up.

[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:56.120]  He said it was a hit on the ambassadors. He didn't want to give missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.920]  We'll see what Puchenik, former head of Black Ops for the State Department, on with us briefly.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.720]  Let's go to Paul in New Jersey, then Tom, Jacob, Ship, and James and others. You're
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.720]  on the air, Paul. Welcome.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:14.320]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex. You talk about the new world order. It's been here for hundreds
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:20.160]  of years. We've been taking over since 1935. We haven't had a president for United States.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.960]  Well, yeah, no, the War Powers Act in 33 put us under an emergency reorganization. It's
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.440]  a public document. They set up the state police that are really federal police. It's the second
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:35.000]  reconstruction and it's all admitted. But the average state police guy out there is
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.700]  just like the public. They don't even know which end is up. So how are you going to talk
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:38.700]  to them?
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:44.520]  Well, what I wanted to say is Al-Qaeda is a terrorist organization for the UN. The Federal
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:51.480]  Reserve does it all. And ARIS is a terrorist collection agency for the UN.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.960]  Absolutely a fact. They set up the same year as the Federal Reserve. It's all in the charter.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.960]  It's all official.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.600]  And the income tax is unlawful as it pertains to you and me. Did you know that? It was only
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600]  for corporations.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.680]  Yes, sir, that's right. And it wasn't given to the general public until 51. They put it
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.680]  on the poor troops.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:10.680]  I run the UCC.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.680]  Yeah.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680]  Universal Commercial Code.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.360]  And once you raise that, let me say something. How the mafia would work, the Italian mafia,
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.840]  famously in New Jersey, New York, Illinois, they would come to you. This is famous. It's
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.860]  on record. They'd say, listen, I'm not going to burn down your clothing or your grocery
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:26.780]  store or your bookstore.
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:31.380]  But if you don't pay me insurance money and hire my cousin, somebody is going to burn
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.960]  it down and then your daughter is going to get raped. So you better pay me. And then
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.120]  if you didn't, it would happen. Now they just say, give me all your rights or Al-Qaeda is
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:45.180]  going to blow you up. So instead of it being Cousin Luigi, it's Cousin Habib. And it's
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.680]  like, you're going to give me all your rights or Habib is going to come in here and blow
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.680]  your butt off.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.320]  Hey, another thing I wanted to say, I was in jail and one thing happened and I was in
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:01.080]  jail with the Gotti guys. And the reason Gotti was put in jail was he was going to go into
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.640]  the drug trade. So that would cut in on the face.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.520]  Yeah, no, no. The Italians got too big for their britches against the wasp, the Irish,
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.200]  the Jewish mafia. That's always been the biggest mafia in this country. I mean, remember there
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:18.480]  wasn't even an Italian mafia in the news till the 50s. They wouldn't even admit organized
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.480]  crime existed.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:26.280]  They said there was lone gangsters. What a joke. No, no. The government, the big banks
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:31.120]  run the CIA and ship the drugs in. That's public. And yes, that's why they shut down
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.800]  John Gotti is he wanted to, well, from what I read, he wanted to ship smack in. Correct?
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800]  And they didn't like that.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800]  Right.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.800]  So you were in jail with them. What'd they say?
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:48.000]  Oh, that's what they said. We wouldn't have been here if Gotti didn't say he was going
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.800]  into the drug business.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.880]  What were you in jail in New Jersey for, Paul?
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.240]  Well, I went in for the income tax, but I found out later they were trying to come after
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:05.760]  me again after I got out. And when I was in jail, when I come back, I was on parole and
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.440]  they took me before the judge again. And I had a pocket constitution. I'm like, Hey,
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.440]  judge, here's the constitution.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.640]  Hey, why were they telling you all this stuff? Were you a, are you a fellow Paisano?
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:23.160]  No, no, no, no. But the judge said, don't bring the constitution to my court. And you
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:30.360]  know what I said to him? I said, judge, you're a treasonous traitor. And he didn't like that.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.680]  And he got all upset and he tore a prosecutor, sent him for mental evaluation.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.680]  Oh yeah. They took that big music star who criticized the government. They, they that's
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.880]  up on him for us. They sent her for re-education. What's her name?
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.040]  Down to North Carolina.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:48.480]  Yeah. Yeah. Macy gray. All right, brother. I got to go. Thank you, Paul. Tom. Good to
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:56.920]  hear from you, brother. Tom Jacobs, ship James. We'll get to all of you. 800-25-99231. Folks,

[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.680]  Thank you for joining us on this Thursday edition, this May 9th transmission. We're
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:36.800]  into the second hour now. Judge orders conspiracy reeducation for Lauryn Hill. Singer told to
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:42.680]  undergo counseling over conspiracy theory that music industry strangles real talent.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.320]  That's an actual quote and they're now coming out in places like Psychology Today saying
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.480]  that I'm insane for believing in a new world order. They also have been saying now for
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:59.040]  eight months that Benghazi being prior knowledge and a stand down is a conspiracy theory.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.800]  And you can pull up articles where in the British press, they're calling for the arrest
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:08.420]  of climate deniers. First, it was global warming was happening. Now, the Earth has stopped
[01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:13.280]  heating and cooling. They're just saying if you deny anything they say, even if it changes
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.120]  day to day, you're mentally ill and have to disappear off into a gulag.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.700]  We're gonna get into Benghazi gate. We now confirmed what we already knew eight months
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.900]  ago here on the air with our guest. Dr. Steve Pechenik, formerly of the State Department
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:32.120]  Psychological Warfare Head, will join us the last 30 minutes of the transmission. He said
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:38.720]  his intel was the ambassador who was an Arabist, as a Christian, trained generationally for
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.640]  200 years to go into the Muslim world and proselytize.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.320]  That's who they hired at the State Department. He came from a long line of Arabist and he
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.720]  was in there and he did not wanna transfer missiles to Al-Qaeda to be used against Syria.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.100]  Heat seeking missiles. Now, there was a double stand down. That's why they fired like ten
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:59.520]  members of CENTCOM, including the head of CENTCOM, made him stand down. Because they
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:05.400]  were so angry, they followed orders and sat there for, first it was two hours and six,
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:10.360]  some estimates eight hours they stood down, days before they begged for support.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:19.040]  And now it's all out. It's all out. And we're gonna go to Tom, Jacob, Chip, James, Mark.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.640]  We'll get to all of you on your calls on Benghazi in about 30 minutes when Lord Moncton leaves
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.880]  us. Then for five minutes, we've got a guest popping in who invented the 3D printable gun
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.640]  that they're trying to ban all over the country. Talk about revolutionary. Technology cuts
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:38.000]  both ways, against the establishment and for it.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.080]  I know that the good guys can become the establishment. And we've gotta get used to winning. My dad
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:51.120]  who's been a successful person in science and in business and in so many other things
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:56.880]  always told me, he said, son, anybody can be successful if you've got decent intelligence
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.660]  and are willing to work hard.
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.800]  You can be successful at basically anything you wanna be successful at, but you can't
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.000]  be successful at everything. You gotta pick the things you really have a passion for and
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.640]  you can be successful in it. And he said something else, he goes, losers would rather steal a
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.000]  dollar from you than make a million dollars with you, cuz they get off on it.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.420]  They think that's winning. And the only thing in this world that has any value is your word
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:23.940]  and that you be an honorable person. And he went on to say, so many people he'd seen with
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:29.920]  high IQs, as soon as they started having real success, self-destructed themselves.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:36.380]  And I have watched that so many times. People see it as shelling out. If we, libertarian
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:42.360]  constitutionalist, 1776 worldwide, as I call it, the idea is the Magna Carta, through the
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:48.480]  Bill of Rights and Constitution. If we breathe life into that, we're going to have victory.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:53.280]  And then as we have victory, people have to believe we can have more success. UKIP, that's
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.680]  why Lord Monckton joins us, but we'll get into the latest carbon taxes, Benghazi, Gate,
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.800]  all of it with him.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.320]  Lord Monckton, of course, served with Margaret Thatcher, who of course passed recently. People
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.400]  can bash her, say she was a globalist all day. I've talked to the Jim Tucker who just
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:14.020]  died who knew her. She helped shoot down Bilderberg, totally taking over UK sovereignty and holding
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:16.080]  up the New World Order 30 years.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:19.720]  And they hated her and did dirty tricks. I'm not saying she's perfect, but people that
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:24.760]  I really respected said she was the real deal. It's like Reagan, he wasn't perfect. He got
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.840]  steered some wrong directions, but he said the nine most scary words around from the
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.480]  government, I'm here to help you.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.260]  Look at Reagan compared to Obama. Look at how far they've taken us. Look at what they
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:38.280]  get away with now. As he can talk about her passing, he was good friends with her and
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:43.920]  her top advisor in science and technology and the press. And of course, his father was
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:53.400]  the Lord of Monckton and Brenchley, and they've now basically turned the House of Lords into
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.280]  a debating club.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.200]  People say, well, aren't you for that? Well, I'm for separation of powers. I don't like
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.580]  the fact that they're spying on the Parliament and that bureaucracy's stealing all the power
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:09.720]  and transferring it to the euro. But I tend to digress. The point is, Lord Monckton joins
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:15.120]  us to talk about all of this. And UKIP just had devastating victories in the elections
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.400]  in the UK, the local elections.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:23.040]  They're having victories, and their idea of sovereignty is having huge victories in the
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.960]  EU Parliament. Even though it's ceremonial, the bully pulpit is bringing the bureaucrats
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.900]  who are exempt from taxes to their knees. So that's basically, for stations that just
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:37.500]  joined us, why I wanna get Monckton on to hurriedly go over all these topics.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:43.160]  But the fact that UKIP, coming from nowhere, founded by Lord Monckton, and Mr. Bloom is
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:49.120]  coming out at the start of the next hour, Godfrey Bloom, and Nigel Farage, in a pub years
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:57.440]  ago, as just businessmen that didn't wanna be EU slaves, and now has Labour and the Tories
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:02.100]  apologizing and shaking in fear after demonizing UKIP.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:06.420]  This is the example and the blueprint of worldwide victory that Lord Monckton has talked about
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:11.080]  so much. So I salute UKIP's victory, sir, and I've been ranting the last five minutes
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:16.640]  on a host of a flotilla of subjects. What would you like to tackle first, Lord Monckton?
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:21.760]  Well, let's begin with that extraordinary victory in the local authority elections here
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:27.920]  in England and Wales, where the United Kingdom Independence Party, which had polled 3% of
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:35.000]  the national vote at the last general election, polled 25% of the national vote this time.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.200]  An astonishing increase in just a few years. And I think the reason for this, really, is
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:46.080]  that people are now waking up to the fact that all the points you've just mentioned,
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.880]  they've been talking nonsense about the climate for years, they've been centralizing
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.360]  power in the hands of unelected people in the European dictatorship for years, and the
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.560]  people are no longer willing to stand for any more of this. The euro, the Mickey Mouse
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:07.840]  monopoly money currency of the European dictatorship has collapsed and collapsed again. The European
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.680]  emissions trading scheme has collapsed now for the sixth or seventh time. I've lost
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:18.280]  count of how many times it's collapsed just this last week. The price of the right to
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:23.200]  emit a ton of carbon dioxide for the big businesses that have to pay it is now only one or two
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.880]  dollars a ton. And the commissars have now realized that they are not going to be allowed
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.560]  to rig that particular market any more to try and force the price artificially up. And
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.840]  that effectively means that the global warming scare is now over as well. And the reason
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.240]  why people have been turning to the United Kingdom independence party in such very large
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.440]  numbers, Alex, is simply that we have been right on all these things all along, you and
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:56.400]  I and UKIP, and we have said that people won't stand for having their democracy taken away,
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.840]  they won't stand for having Magna Carta in this side of the Atlantic and the Constitution
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:06.480]  at your side of it torn up, they won't stand for the national bankruptcy which is being
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.920]  caused by massive overborrowing both in the United States and in the United Kingdom and
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.960]  in many countries of Europe. They won't stand for any more of this climate nonsense.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.240]  We now want to get our governing class either to face reality or go and be replaced by a
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:27.360]  new governing class consisting of people who actually know what they're doing.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.520]  What would Margaret Thatcher if she was still in her prime be doing right now, if she was
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:37.920]  seeing all this open authoritarianism going on, Benghazi gate, Obama has Democrats all
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:44.520]  over the news saying your children belong to the state. It has reached a ultra theater
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520]  of the absurd.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:51.800]  And that I think is what is so useful. Margaret Thatcher would have left the European Union
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:58.440]  in the 1990s if she had still been prime minister. She was already working on that when she left
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:04.360]  office in 1990. And she would have been very determined to see the back of the European
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:10.040]  Union because it isn't democratic and because it takes away national sovereignty and doesn't
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.080]  transfer it to elected hands elsewhere but to unelected hands elsewhere. She was very
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:22.120]  conscious of the problem that as you transfer wealth and power from elected hands in those
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.520]  countries still lucky enough to have them, which doesn't include Britain unfortunately,
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:33.160]  to foreign institutions, whether they be supranational like the EU or global like the UN, then you're
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:40.600]  always transferring powers to unelected organizations. So power passes from elected to unelected
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:47.160]  hands. Now this, she always realized, was a danger to the very idea of democracy, which
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:52.520]  we acquired after a thousand painful years of constitutional history and which you took
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:18:00.120]  for yourselves in a few glorious years in the 1770s. And so she saw this threat and
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:04.960]  she would have opposed it. She also, of course, was paying back the national debt. We were
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.640]  running by the end of her term of office a very substantial national surplus. In fact,
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:17.920]  we paid off half of the entire 250-year accumulated national debt of the United Kingdom when she
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.860]  left office. And the very next Prime Minister that came in threw that precious financial
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:31.680]  advantage away. And so she would have been exercising tight fiscal and monetary discipline.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.640]  She would be making sure we were not printing money. Did you know that Obama is now printing
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:43.080]  via the Fed a trillion dollars without any backing at all every year? That's the latest
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:49.560]  figure I've just had. It's called QE3. And the inflation, no matter what they say in
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:54.880]  the press, is devastating. The prices are just exploding everywhere. Well, and they're
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.440]  bound to because, of course, if you've got five beans and five dollars, then one dollar
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.600]  is one bean. But if you've got five beans and ten dollars, then each bean is going to
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:09.360]  be two dollars. That's inflation. It's not funny. And that's what they're creating. And
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:14.160]  I think now creating it deliberately. It's not just a matter of buying time in the hope
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.600]  that some cheap fix will be found. I think they're doing it deliberately to destroy the
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.560]  U.S. economy. And we've seen this all before. It's happened time and time again in U.S.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.560]  history, actually, with this.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.560]  No, that's Cloward and Piven. That's Cloward and Piven. We'll talk about that when we come
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.560]  back. They're on record saying we will bankrupt you. We will shut your industry down and we
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:37.880]  will make you go on welfare and make you love the government. This is the collectivization.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:43.440]  I want to talk about the Benghazi gate with you and get your take on that, because I know
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.840]  you've been following it closely. I want to get the latest carbon taxes. Prince Charles
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:53.240]  saying we're not paying enough. All of it with Lord Monckton. And we'll give you his
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:59.720]  website, the Science and Public Policy site as well. U.R.L. when we come back. Lord Christopher
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.840]  Monckton is our guest.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:05.800]  What's more amazing than a Swiss Army knife? A survival business card. It's 11 functions
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.660]  rolled into one pocket-sized tool, including a sharp knife, a saw, a bottle opener, a can

[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:36.800]  right now could take away your right to keep and bear arms. If Obama has his way, all guns
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:41.500]  will be either banned, restricted or confiscated, possibly by executive order. The best way
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:46.520]  to keep your guns is to hide them. When Obama can't find, Obama can't take away. You can

[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:13.000]  the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:22.360]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They sew pride

[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:43.600]  correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.000]  the liberties of the people than a standing army. Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver

[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.240]  scientific documentation and well written articles. And you've got Mark Moreno with

[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.600]  Lord Monckton, this is your short segment. We've got the next segment. I'll let you get
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.400]  out of here because I know you're busy. But I wanted to, you're a historian as well as
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.600]  an inventor and a scientist. I wanted to ask you this. There are periods in history, as
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:11.080]  you know, where more happens in a year than happened in the previous 20. And there are
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:15.240]  some periods in history in these trends where more happens in a year than happens in the
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:21.160]  last 100 in real developments. Now with technology advancing, the singularity down the road,
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.240]  all of this, things are obviously accelerated.
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:29.560]  But we now have a spectacle of government corruption and corporate corruption and collectivist
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:37.120]  cronyism and crony capitalism naked. But they're just more brazen, more arrogant, operating
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:45.120]  criminally now in plain view, militarizing against us and then getting caught. I've talked
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:50.440]  to top people. They killed the ambassador cuz he didn't wanna give missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:55.240]  What is going on with collectivist? What is going on with Obama? What is going on with
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:01.280]  the staged Arab Spring? Why put radical Muslims in everywhere? Why do all this? Cuz I know
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.960]  what you keep, you study this.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.400]  What is happening historically? Because stuff has gotten so absurdist, I don't even know
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.840]  what to say anymore. Is it that the ruling class is smoking their own dope and has lost
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.320]  total control?
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:21.360]  They have lost control. The ruling class is no longer a ruling class, properly speaking,
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:27.280]  at all. And they've lost control for two main reasons. One is that they've run out of other
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:34.640]  people's money. And the other is that they think like a hive mind. So once the party
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:40.360]  line is dictated to them, they will accept that and parrot it. They've been doing this
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:46.760]  on the EU here in the UK for the last 30 years. Now people are just kicking against it and
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.200]  not buying it anymore. But for 30 years, they got away with it. They've been doing the
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:55.840]  same on climate change. They're doing the same on what we need is more international
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:01.240]  socialism, more power for the UN, etc., etc., less power for individual nation states. And
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:08.200]  in particular, there is a very vicious anti-Western hatred in the thinking of the hard left, which
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:15.360]  forms this terrible hive mind, this dangerous consensus, as they like to call it, this party
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:22.040]  line, which they trot out. And the problem now is that the left have got control of the
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.840]  media. They've got control of, of course, Congress at the moment. They've got control
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:35.280]  of the White House. And this means that they can now, they think, do more or less anything.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:42.080]  The problem is this, that the money has run out, and they are really, really scared, because
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:50.440]  they know that the state can only function if it can pay its way. And okay, you can pay
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:56.260]  your way by earning it, you can pay your way for a time by borrowing it. But what happens
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:01.640]  when people realise that they're never going to get paid back? And that's where the US
[01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:10.040]  economy now is. You see, you've got debts, as of the last count, of $17 trillion. I think
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:17.200]  it was $4 trillion under George Bush. It's $17 trillion now, and rising at a rate of
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.200]  a million dollars.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:24.000]  Obama has spent more money than George W. Bush, all the way back to George Washington
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.120]  in four years.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.960]  That's right. And it's getting worse, because they're now in that terrible inflationary
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.880]  spiral where, because they've borrowed so much in the past and they're borrowing so
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:41.440]  much more on top, the interest payments are now so large that whatever else you do, you've
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:46.120]  got to pay those or nobody will lend you any more money. And so they're having to start
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.520]  thinking about making cuts. And of course, the socialists don't like to make cuts.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:54.240]  They don't like to count how many beans make five. And now they're faced with the
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:29:00.080]  reality of having to do this. They're realizing that this is really electorally very unpopular.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.280]  Obama's strategy during the first four years was he reckoned he could just about get away
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:09.200]  with it by going on printing and borrowing, which he did. Now, he can't go on getting
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.720]  away with it for very much longer. The Chinese, who are the lenders of last resort at the
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:18.520]  moment, are beginning to worry about whether they'll ever get paid back. And they will
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.600]  eventually decide, look, you know, we can afford to cut our losses on the state by not
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.320]  lending them any more money because the Chinese are not worried actually about seeing the
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.640]  United States survive because they're a major customer. They're worried about the United
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.920]  States competing with the natural resources. That's what matters to the Chinese. Then you
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:41.360]  look at the Arab world where, as you say, very strange things went on. There was this
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:45.720]  hint of the Arab Spring. Stay there, sir. Stay there. Short break, long segment coming
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.280]  up with Lord Moncton. Stay with us. I want to get your take on Benghazi.

[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:23.220]  states on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:28.580]  camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of

[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:08.560]  the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:13.560]  the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:18.000]  in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so

[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:16.920]  is made out of mud. A poor man's made out of muscle and blood. Muscle and blood and
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:24.320]  skin and bones. A mind that's weak and a back that's strong. You load 16 tons. What are
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.320]  you getting? Another day older and deeper in depth. St. Peter don't you call me cause
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:36.920]  I can't go. I owe my soul to the company store. That's right. The government wants you to
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:44.560]  owe your soul to it. And all the miscreant nobodies that build their own empires in the
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.600]  government and red carpets and all the rest of the garbage. It's just, it's amazing. The
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:55.680]  more society's in decline, the more the government worships itself with big aircraft and, you
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:02.080]  know, Royal uniforms and for stewing themselves with red carpets. But then it's been hundreds
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:06.320]  of years since these politicians actually went on the front lines to lead a war. They
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:10.800]  send our boys off to do it. Final segment with Lord Monckton. Lord Monckton, what concerns
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.880]  you in the future? I know during the break you were telling me about a new article you've
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:20.240]  written at science and public policy.org. We need to post it at infoawards.com. What
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:26.360]  are the dangers, but what are also the silver linings? What is the course out of, because
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:30.760]  I said what you just said last segment in the first hour. Government and corrupt elements
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:34.680]  of it have never been more exposed, but that makes them more dangerous than ever because
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:39.800]  they are on the edge of losing power. They are on the edge of a major sea change, a new
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:44.040]  renaissance in my summation. Correct me if you think I'm historically wrong, but that
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:50.740]  is the great crossroad that we're now at. So what are the main threats and then what
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:55.360]  are the main avenues out of this impending dark age they want to bring us into?
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:35:01.200]  Right. The first thing is the main threat immediately to the United States is that you're
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:06.440]  running out of money. The government is broke and not just broke. It's in negative territory
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:12.820]  at a very serious degree. This is now a serious problem, but the dollar is already beginning
[01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:19.240]  to lose its status as the world's reserve currency. Now that matters a lot because while
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:23.960]  it served as a reserve currency, it meant that foreign countries had large holdings
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.320]  of dollars, which effectively meant that you could print money against their holdings and
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:34.660]  pay yourselves more money even if you hadn't earned it. But that is now about to stop and
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:41.980]  already secret meetings are being held between other major countries such as China, France,
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:49.200]  the United Kingdom, Germany, and various others about replacing the dollar with a different
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.520]  currency. The International Monetary Fund, which nobody elects, is proposing that its
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.700]  own currency, what's called the special drawing right, should become the new reserve
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:03.020]  currency. Of course, that would be no better than the dollar, frankly, because that too
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:08.960]  is in negative territory. But it's clear that the reign of the dollar as the mighty
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:13.560]  dollar which everybody uses for their financial transactions is already over. I'm going
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:20.100]  to give you one tiny indication of this, and that is that between China and Korea, there
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:26.060]  is now an agreement that they will no longer use the dollar to denominate international
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:30.220]  contracts between the two countries. Instead, they will use either the Chinese yuan, which
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:36.020]  is the foreign version of their currency, or they will use the Korean won. And this
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:41.660]  is the first of many such bilateral and eventually multilateral deals that are now in prospect
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:47.740]  and being done to dethrone the dollar, not because everybody hates the dollar, but because
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:52.580]  they fear that it's not worth anything anymore, because there's too much of it being printed,
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:57.740]  not enough being done to back it up, no work being done, government hugely overspending,
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:04.660]  no attempt by Obama to rein in the spending. Everything is out of control. And the fear
[01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:10.540]  is that very suddenly, this can happen very suddenly, once the dollar loses its status
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:16.500]  as the global reserve currency, then you will get inflation like you've never seen. And
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.500]  it will happen more or less overnight. And so what I'm saying to people now is buy
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:24.780]  silver coins and buy them quick and keep them hidden, because you're going to need them
[01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:28.260]  when there isn't any longer a paper currency. And that's why they're in a war against
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:31.780]  gold and silver, because it exposes that. You hit something last segment I want you
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:34.300]  to elaborate on. I don't want to hit some of the latest climate news and let you go
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:41.700]  because you're busy. You talked about in the so-called left who are really just authoritarians,
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:44.500]  because again, I'm not even a right winger. I'm just a constitutionalist who wants common
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:49.300]  sense freedom. You can call it whatever you want. On many issues, I'd be called a liberal
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:53.740]  200 years ago. So these terms don't really mean much. They call themselves liberals.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:58.260]  That's really a political cover. But you talked about their hate of the West, their hate of
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:05.100]  masculinity, even though they're mainly men, their hatred of anything pure because it threatens
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:10.760]  their criminal instinct. And that's from my study, and here's my question, is so key.
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:16.660]  Because you're absolutely right, obviously. Sure, you could say Obama's really CIA and
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:21.200]  he's playing the part of the left and they're going to organize things and they wouldn't
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:25.360]  kill the dollar. They wouldn't do this to America. But the truth is, they have such
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:32.560]  a core hatred of this republic that they do want to see it burn, kind of like a criminal
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.700]  wants to be caught.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:38.680]  And this is something we see in psychology and criminology. These are self-destructive
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:44.020]  lunatics. Even though they're in control, they hate those of us that live in the West
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:47.140]  so much, they want to burn it down. Lord Moncton.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:55.140]  Well, there is, I'm afraid, an element of very strong hatred of the West and of Christianity
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:39:02.180]  and of freedom and democracy and prosperity and capitalism and free markets, stock markets.
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:08.580]  They hate all of that because it was successful. And these losers don't like to see anybody
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.660]  else succeeding. So they want everybody to be losers too. That's their solution to
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:18.980]  things. And you see this even in literal ways. For instance, for a time, as you know, because
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:24.140]  I did this on a previous show with you, our appalling Prime Minister, David Cameron, who
[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:28.580]  is going to go down as one of the worst prime ministers in British history and also one
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:35.060]  of the shortest lived, I think. He tried to ban the wearing of Christian symbols such
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:42.140]  as crucifixes in public places. And of course, you know, I went out and I was given by one
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:45.900]  of the people who came to my talks in San Diego, a very nice and Benedict cross, which
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:51.260]  I've been wearing. And I wore it around London in Club London. The eyebrows were going up
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:54.860]  all over the place. What's he doing wearing a crucifix? And I would tell them, I'd say
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:58.500]  it's because Cameron's trying to ban. And this is, and by the way, this is a global
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:04.740]  initiative. And so I stopped him doing it. And there's not only I, but others stopped
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:09.320]  him doing it. But you see, there is this hatred of Christianity. He wasn't going to ban wearing
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:16.340]  of a Sikh turban or a Muslim burka. No, no, no. Only the Christian symbols. Only the symbols
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:21.140]  of a national religion of these islands. That's what he was going to attack. And there's
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:26.740]  this extraordinary self-destructiveness that goes right through our political class. And
[01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:33.200]  they hate the West. And they feel guilty about the time of colonial expansion. They feel
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.160]  guilty about the British Empire. They feel guilty about capitalism being successful.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.200]  They feel guilty that we are not poor and other countries are. And they then manufacture
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.500]  this guilt about the climate as well to try and say we've got to beat our breast and
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.820]  shut down our industry to save the planet. The planet was triumphantly saved 2,000 years
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:56.540]  ago. It doesn't need saving again. But that's their slogan. We want to shut everything down.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:00.900]  We want to shut the West down. And Obama is doing it in the simplest and most straightforward
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:06.660]  way possible, which is to borrow beyond all capacity of the United States to repay, to
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:11.300]  topple the dollar from its perch as the world's reserve currency. It used to be the British
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:18.220]  pound. We made the same mistake with hardline Moscow socialists in 1967, when eventually
[01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:22.300]  they had to devalue the pound. And that meant that the pound immediately ceased to be the
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:27.800]  world's reserve currency. The dollar replaced it. The dollar is now going down by two policies
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:34.620]  exactly the same as the policies that our Communist Labour Party followed over here.
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:39.780]  And he is doing it quite deliberately, I think. He's doing it knowing the destruction he's
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:46.460]  going to cause. He doesn't care. He absolutely hates not just Britain, where he removed Churchill's
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:51.900]  bust from the White House as his first public act. He hates America, too. And one should
[01:41:51.900 --> 01:42:00.580]  never misunderstand that. He loathes America, and he will destroy it if he can. And unfortunately,
[01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:01.940]  the electorate has given him a second chance.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:07.280]  And by the way, that's because any group trying to conquer wants to overthrow whatever the
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:13.740]  old power structure was. And I certainly don't romanticize older segments of the power structure
[01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:19.140]  in England or the US. But compared to these people, they were angels. And these people
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:24.180]  see anyone who's independent as a threat to their monopoly, like Kim Jong-un of North
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.180]  Korea.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:30.240]  And it's that criminal instinct that drives them. And did you know they're telling Christians
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:37.180]  they can't talk about Christ or wear a Christian symbol if they're in the military? They are
[01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:41.580]  taking degrees from valedictorians in their own commencement speeches. If they say they
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:46.380]  owe things to God when there's no law, the First Amendment says the government can't
[01:42:46.380 --> 01:42:47.820]  block you from religion.
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:52.620]  Not that you can't, in your own speech, say you give the glory to Jesus Christ. I mean,
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:58.920]  why in closing, and then we're gonna let you go, Lord Monckton, why are they so diametrically
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:03.580]  opposed to Christianity across the board? I mean, they came out recently and taught
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:10.420]  the Pentagon, this is Fox News, that all Catholics are, quote, extremists next to Al-Qaeda.
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:15.580]  Show the Fox News headline, guys. And that all evangelicals, I mean, what is this? This
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:21.020]  is so absurdist. They're obviously the bad guys. They're obviously communists.
[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:27.860]  I'll tell you exactly what it is. If you subscribe either to the Catholic Church or to any of
[01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:34.300]  the evangelical churches that are similar, they not only give you a body of belief which
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:40.700]  is independent of any socialist or communist or fascist group, but they also give you a
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:46.300]  personal relationship with Almighty God. And that means that you think independently for
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:51.380]  yourself. And that's the one thing they cannot, the hive mind cannot stand that. It
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:56.620]  cannot stand the thought that there are people who have independent thoughts who say, we
[01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:00.720]  want to be Christians. We don't want to belong to the European Union. We don't want
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.700]  to have any of this climate nonsense rammed down our throats. We want to be free, democratic,
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:09.860]  prosperous people. They don't want people thinking for themselves. That's what it's
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:15.020]  really about. It's about total control. But totalitarian, this is the word that describes
[01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:19.980]  them, the Chinese in the early imperial Chinese called them legalists. These are the people
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:25.720]  who we would call them now control freaks. They want to control everything and everybody
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:31.180]  down to the last miserable, flicking, flickering, poison filled light bulb that you can or can't
[01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:35.340]  have in your house, whether you want to turn it on or not is another matter. They want
[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:41.920]  to control every aspect of our lives. They will not allow us to just get on with it ourselves.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:47.780]  We have to be regulated and taxed to death. That is their sole shoddy ambition. It's
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:54.220]  an extraordinary nihilistic, destructive ambition. These are people who cannot create anything
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:59.980]  themselves. All they want to do is destroy what others have created. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:06.100]  Haring things down. That's their main motive. Absolute destruction. They'll do it from within
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:11.060]  by subversion. They'll do it by commanding the government and the media. The media looks
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:15.680]  the other way. While Obama trashes the US economy, the greatest economy the world has
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:22.020]  ever seen is now being brought low by one man in the White House who is not being held
[01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:26.060]  to account by the media, except for people like you, Alex, and it weren't for people
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:29.100]  like you. Then it would have been all over by now.
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:33.620]  Well, you too, Lord Moncken. Some voices, while you're still allowed to broadcast.
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:37.820]  Absolutely. People better appreciate. People better appreciate science and public policy.org.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:41.880]  They better know about Cloward and Piven's strategy to bring us down. They better appreciate
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:46.500]  DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com. They better appreciate WorldNetDaily. They better appreciate
[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:51.360]  the few groups out there because we're having a great effect and others need to join us
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:56.380]  and what shocks me, Lord Moncken, in closing, is you're saying all this stuff and it's all
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:57.380]  true.
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:02.020]  I mean, they say they want a post-industrial world. They say they hate fathers. Every show
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:08.700]  on TV pulls down fathers. This is a group of deviant scum and I declare that I am free
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:14.380]  of them and everyone else, we need to perform a mass exorcism on the West over the New World
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:18.620]  Order. These people are pit of hell demons. Lord Moncken, we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:21.860]  Congratulations on sweeping to victory in the UK.
[01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:27.180]  Well, God bless you, Alex, and what we're going to need to do now is to form our own
[01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:32.340]  international party of freedom to make sure that we fight back against this before it's
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:33.340]  too late.
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:36.180]  Let's get you on the next month because I want to plan, and you've talked about this
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:39.300]  for years, it's starting to happen. It's time for Ron Paul to get involved and help lead
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:43.940]  it with you guys. It is time to put out our global manifesto against tyranny as a clear
[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:47.340]  choice and get on the offense. Thank you, Lord Moncken.
[01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:48.700]  Thank you, God bless America.
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:52.420]  All right, there he goes, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, look, we either get on the march or
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:56.220]  it's over, okay? We either take action or it's over. Let's get Cody Wilson. I know I'm
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:01.780]  about six minutes late getting him on. He's very busy. He's got another interview to break
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.020]  down what's going on.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:07.540]  But Lord Moncken, newspaper editor, inventor, classical architect, trained orator, and high
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:14.420]  priest of climate skepticism. So he was just with us. Cody Wilson, an American law student
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:19.100]  and self-proclaimed crypto anarchist and free market anarchist, he's gonna be joining us
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:20.220]  if we can get him on the line here.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:26.100]  He's all over the news, BBC, AP, Reuters. They've got three states, New York, California,
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:34.260]  it's not a state, DC, the criminal command center, trying to ban 3D printable guns right
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:39.820]  now. And it came out last week, he now has a little 22 single shot. And this is just
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:44.040]  what he's doing in his little laboratory with a couple of friends helping him here
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.780]  in Austin, Texas.
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:51.980]  And Cody Wilson, thank you for joining us from Defense Distributed. And I'm reading
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:48:01.380]  here 100,000 of the 22 plastic gun has been downloaded by people. So that's got to be
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:06.620]  panicking the control freaks. They'll have to put on fancier costumes to impress us,
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:07.620]  Cody.
[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:14.940]  Well, first I'll say that the gun is actually chambered in 380, a little bit more of a pack
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:15.940]  punch than a 22.
[01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:19.020]  Oh, I'm sorry. It looked like a 22. I saw you shooting it. Yeah.
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:23.540]  No, it's fine. You know, it's tiny. It's a good instinct. But in fact, the people with
[01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:28.620]  the shinier badges have come down as of 20 minutes ago, the Secretary of State and Department
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:34.260]  of Defense trade controls have demanded I take down the files from defcat.org as they
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:38.100]  assert information control and arms export control.
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.020]  Is that breaking? Is that breaking right now?
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:46.900]  That's breaking news. That's breaking news. Defcat is going dark now at the request of
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:50.540]  the United States government, Secretary of State and Department of Defense trade control.
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:55.300]  Okay, guys, get a Don Salazar on that right now to break that. Did you get this via email
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:57.300]  or a call, Cody?
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:00.500]  Got it by email, unclassified email.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:03.500]  Can you read us what it says, Placer?
[01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.500]  Yeah, let me open up the whole thing.
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:09.900]  Sure. Well, yeah, start reading. Thank you so much. I want to break this right here on
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:10.900]  air.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:19.060]  I reply to the DTCC case 13, blah, blah, blah. Dear Mr. Wilson, the Department of State,
[01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:23.380]  Bureau of Political and Military Affairs, Office of Defense trade controls compliance
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:27.840]  enforcement division is responsible for compliance with civil enforcement of the Arms Export
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.480]  Control Act and the Arms Export Control Act implementing regulations, the International
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:40.480]  Traffic and Arms Regulations and the USML. The AECA and ITAR impose certain requirements
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.960]  and restrictions on the transfer of or access to controlled defense articles and related
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:51.100]  technical data designated by the United States Munitions List. DTCC is conducting a review
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:55.080]  of technical data made publicly available by defense distributed through its 3D printing
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:00.060]  website defcat.org, the majority of which appears to be related to items in category
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:04.680]  one of the United States Munitions List. Defense distributed may have released ITAR controlled
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:09.460]  technical data without the required prior authorization from the director of defense
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:15.220]  trade controls, a violation of the ITAR. Technical data regulated under the ITAR refers to information

[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:04.580]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book Cancer Step Outside the
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:10.900]  Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:15.020]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the
[01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:20.580]  President could obtain this world class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:25.100]  used around the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved
[01:52:25.100 --> 01:52:30.820]  ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:36.020]  to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,
[01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:40.240]  now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:50.260]  that don't belong in your body. Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:58.740]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com. Protect your immune system.
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:52:59.740]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:05.860]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:10.580]  and floods raged across the US, costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:14.980]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:19.460]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.
[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:24.380]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:29.260]  Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:33.700]  of your food supply with eFoods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense
[01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:38.540]  food you can store for up to 25 years. You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:42.420]  you. Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from

[01:54:01.580 --> 01:54:15.180]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:20.540]  Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed was already scheduled on this show. This is breaking here
[01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:25.340]  right now. Cody, finishing up the email, but repeating what you told me during the break,
[01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:29.120]  you're saying obviously that there's criminal penalties in those codes they're threatening
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:33.380]  you with, and you were saying that's why you're complying right now and going dark. You're
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:36.780]  obviously been testing this. You've got the floor. Tell people what you want them to know
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:37.780]  out there.
[01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:45.180]  I want them to know that the Department of Defense Trade Controls believes Defense Distributed
[01:54:45.180 --> 01:54:50.900]  has not established the jurisdiction to publish our information. The United States believes
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:54.620]  that certain information is controlled according to the Department of Defense Trade Controls,
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:55:02.500]  that they can assert information control over data or pictures, images related to anything
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:07.220]  on the United States Munitions List. The Department has demanded that I take down immediately
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:13.940]  for download the Liberator Pistol, our.22 files, our Muzzle Brake files, our slide assemblies,
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:19.740]  our moderators, our adapters, inserts, sites. Anything at DEFCAD will be going down because
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:24.580]  the Department of Defense Trade Controls believes it has authority to grant permission or license
[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:33.140]  to put that data into the internet. I have to comply with this.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:39.540]  And how incredible is it that they can claim via import-export now that the web is worldwide,
[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:44.620]  that means they can censor anything on the web in the U.S. claiming they have total jurisdiction
[01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:49.180]  over anything and everything in the world. That is in essence total tyranny.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:54.900]  That's exactly right. This is the claim of ultimate jurisdiction in the age of the internet,
[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:58.340]  in the age of when I can design anything on my computer and send it to you anywhere in
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:02.740]  the world. They can say that my creation is in fact not wholly my creation, that they
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:07.820]  have some ownership of that property. And even then, it's not even property, it's just
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:12.540]  information, which they have a partial stake and claim of ownership in as well. This is
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:17.080]  the logical end of authoritarianism.
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.740]  And again, I was setting you up on the show just so you could talk about the fact that
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:26.060]  hundreds of thousands were downloading the 380 Liberator pistol. They were downloading
[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:31.740]  the 22, they were downloading the 223, they were downloading all these designs. And all
[01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:39.140]  I can say is too late. I mean, this is so amazing that they're saying you can't print
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:42.980]  a gun, but they can have nuclear weapons that we paid for.
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:48.260]  Oh, believe me, I mean, you're not gonna find me disagreeing with you. I think it's interesting
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:52.980]  that the domestic politicians are interested in regulating your printer and the feds are
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:57.620]  interested in regulating your internet and information. I mean, you know, leave them
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:02.500]  all to their devices. Believe me, you're not gonna be printing guns anytime soon.
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:09.160]  Amazing, amazing. How are they gonna keep the genie in the bottle though? I mean, there's
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:13.060]  no way they're gonna stop this revolution from taking over.
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:15.740]  I don't know, but they're gonna try their best, which we should have predicted that
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:20.500]  they would. I'm interested in having this conversation though. Is information able to
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:25.860]  be controlled in this way? I mean, I think they'll try their best and perhaps also for
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:27.580]  some incredible consequences.
[01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:33.380]  But I think that 100,000 Liberators were downloaded. A lot of this digital information, those are
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:39.420]  all infinitely copyable. And the Pirate Bay, the world's largest file sharing site, maintains
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:44.220]  many copies of the pistol there already. I'm here to tell you that after DefCab goes down,
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:48.180]  that will be the place you need to go to get the pistol. And many people the world over
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:50.860]  will probably hear about the fact that it went down.
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:56.340]  Now, are you gonna shut down DefCab? Are you gonna shut the site completely down? Or are
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:58.060]  you just gonna take the files off?
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:03.180]  I just have to remove the files from public access according to the request in the letter.
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:07.060]  Is it a request or an order? Is it a request or an order? How is it worded?
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:11.860]  It is a request, but we know how requests from the federal government work. I mean,
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:14.860]  it's a request.
[01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:18.140]  Well you're a law student, but you probably need to talk to a lawyer about this. I don't
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:22.700]  even know if you have to comply, but you've already been pretty bold. You're bolder than
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:23.700]  I would be on this.
[01:58:23.700 --> 01:58:28.140]  Yeah, well actually, the reason I'm complying is that not only did they ask that I take
[01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:33.020]  it down, but they asked that I immediately submit a commodity jurisdiction request to
[01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:37.460]  see if they... Basically, I have to ask them if they have authority over my information
[01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:38.940]  one piece at a time. I go, hey...
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:42.040]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.940]  They want him to opt into their jurisdiction. That's what's happening, total fraud. We'll
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:51.580]  be right back, third hour, straight ahead. Cody Wilson.
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:57.180]  With health threats on the rise, such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:59:01.780]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support

[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:12.740]  clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver,

[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:31.340]  All right, folks, this is breaking right now here on Infowars Radio and Infowars TV. We'll
[02:00:31.340 --> 02:00:36.780]  have more tonight, 7 o'clock, Infowars Nightly News. Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed,
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:45.000]  one of the main inventor of the 3D printable magazines and then a 3D printable 380 and
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.900]  other things, has now been, again, that's how they do it. Here is your directive. Here's
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:55.340]  the US code with our criminal jurisdiction, but we request you then take this down and
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:01:00.980]  then come to us and file to see if you're allowed to do this.
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:06.220]  So they're opting to get you into their jurisdiction, which I have to say a little bit of international
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:10.800]  law and I read a lot of lawyers on this subject. I do not believe they have this jurisdiction.
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.940]  And if we comply and set the precedent, it'll say anything we do on the Internet is under
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:20.100]  the import-export controls, which is what the government does with other governments
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:24.340]  and is separate. It's basically admiralty law. But Cody, I wanna give you the floor
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:27.300]  for the rest of this segment. What else do you wanna get across to people?
[02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:33.060]  Yeah, this could be really significant. I would encourage everyone to communicate with
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:36.420]  that department, the Department of Defense State Controls and the Secretary of State.
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:39.660]  Send them an email saying that they don't have control over the Internet because this
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:45.740]  could serve as a presidential case where any information you further put on the Internet,
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:50.020]  especially related to firearms, comes through, let's say, a new bureaucratic channel that
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:54.220]  they'll set up here in the next few months to deal with exactly what we're doing. They're
[02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:59.580]  going to try to assert control over this unless people demand that they don't. And, ladies
[02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:03.540]  and gentlemen, I'm not going to stop developing and doing the kinds of things that we're
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:07.740]  doing. So if you're happy to let the United States become a social prison, that's fine.
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:11.340]  It's going to happen. We'll leave and go somewhere else if we can, but they're not
[02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:13.420]  going to stop unless you make them.
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:19.660]  Well, you're right. And they always use these import-export groups to say, you gave
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:22.940]  money to somebody that gave money to somebody that gave money to a terrorist. We're gonna
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:27.980]  take all your bank accounts in your house without due process. This admiralty law is
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:29.700]  out of control.
[02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:35.700]  Yeah, we're probably gonna claim a public domain exemption from the United States, well,
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:40.820]  from the ITAR registry or the ITAR classifications. But it's interesting that the law is so
[02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:46.260]  old, apparently, that public domain, for purposes of export, still doesn't include the internet.
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:50.820]  I can release something to you publicly on the internet, and it doesn't count as that
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:56.300]  kind of release. For public domain purposes, I could only release something at a bookstore
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:03:00.700]  or a newsstand or a conference. These things count as public domain. The law hasn't been
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:05.300]  updated to reflect that the internet exists. And so they're going to use that letter
[02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:09.820]  to regulate the future.
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:16.220]  This is unprecedented. And, you know, the governments have published mousepox that kills
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:21.260]  over 90% of the humans that come in contact with it, how to build it, how to make it.
[02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:27.340]  But they're saying you can't put out a file for people to get a 380 single shot to protect
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:28.340]  themselves.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:35.460]  Out of plastic, mind you. Made on a technology most people don't have access to. I mean,
[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:42.980]  this is a direct attempt to assert some regulatory control over the future itself.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:47.320]  And they're using this arms import-export group. I've got the official letter. Thank
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:52.180]  you for sending it to us. We're gonna get it up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[02:03:52.180 --> 02:03:56.540]  right now. You've got several sites. What's the most important site to follow all the
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:04:00.060]  videos and news as this unfolds, Cody?
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:03.420]  I would go to DefCAD and see that. Look at all the things that you're not allowed to
[02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:09.100]  have. I would send donations to Defense Distributed. We'll likely need them. I'll probably be talking
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:13.740]  to a few lawyers for a few months. And I would also remind people that DefCAD and Defense
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:18.060]  Distributed files will likely not be available for download for a very long time.
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.060]  When is it going dark?
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:20.060]  If you know where they are.
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:21.060]  When is it going dark?
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:24.660]  It's going dark right now. It's in the process right now. Haroon is one by one taking all
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:30.220]  the download files. I believe it's likely already achieved. This site has gone down.
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:35.860]  All right. There you go. Memory hold. Big brother. The new dark age trying to suppress
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:43.540]  the Renaissance. There is the letter on screen. Cody Wilson, obviously stand by. I want the
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:46.820]  crew to talk to you. I'd like you to come in for the nightly news if you can do it.
[02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:51.060]  I know you've got other media, but if you want to come in for the nightly news anytime
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:55.020]  up to seven tonight, they could go live. You're welcome. Let me say bye to you during the
[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:59.380]  break. Godfrey Bloom, one of the founders of UKIP is coming up and Dr. Steve Pacinek

[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:10.040]  food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion in lost
[02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:15.040]  crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You

[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:34.360]  of Defense Distributed, one of the biggest news stories off and on the last year. We
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:39.400]  were the first to interview him. Don Salazar here in Austin, Texas, when he had done a
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:48.560]  3D printable M4 or AR 15 slash M16 223 magazine, then he made the lower receiver.
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:57.720]  Now he made a plastic composite with a 3D printer 380. He also made a 22. And now the
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:02.040]  Defense Department through import export control. Let's put the letter up on screen if we can
[02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:06.200]  before we go to our guest. Put this up and I was reading a letter during the break. This
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:10.480]  just came to him about 30 minutes ago. We're breaking it here. It's under basically you
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:17.040]  in treaty. This is this this import export is basically complying with the UN treaty
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:23.540]  saying you can't traffic in any small arm anywhere in the world, including in plans
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:25.240]  over the Internet.
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:29.240]  So this is the type of garbage and this ties into the UN treaty. So I'm gonna have a don
[02:09:29.240 --> 02:09:34.760]  put this letter on the web. We're breaking it. I'm gonna have a don put the basic blurb
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:39.480]  up at info wars.com. This is big breaking news. I'm gonna have an ad to it. But this
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:43.580]  is exactly the type of stuff that is in the UN treaty.
[02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:47.840]  And they have no jurisdiction, but they're claiming it and they wanna codify it to actually
[02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:56.120]  make it law cuz this isn't a law yet. They wanna get the Senate to ratify the UN treaty
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:00.580]  because what they're claiming here is what is in the UN treaty. You can't ship ammo around
[02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:06.000]  the world without their express authorization. The UN and your nation's import export control
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:11.200]  and Obama's saying he's gonna use executive orders to stop American companies selling
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:16.320]  guns that gets into citizens hands anywhere in the world to protect themselves.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:20.640]  And they're gonna stop guns and ammo from around the world coming in. This is all public.
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:26.660]  So I'm gonna have that added to a Don Salazar's article that's going up. The basic blurb and
[02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:31.480]  info in the next ten minutes. It'll be red linked at infoawards.com with the letters
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:34.960]  so you can read it, but I have now read it. And they're basically threatening criminal
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:40.080]  penalties under US code if he doesn't take it down, which they've now taken the files,
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.640]  to the printable guns off the web.
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:47.560]  And then now he has to file and submit to their jurisdiction to see if he'll be given
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:52.100]  authorization. So he's filing in, waiving his rights if he does that. He's a law student.
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:55.600]  He's getting lawyers. He obviously knows not to do that. But he knew he was creating a
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:59.360]  legal challenge in all of this. It's like black folks going and sitting at lunch counters
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:00.360]  in the 50s and 60s.
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:04.480]  Well, hey, you're gonna get arrested, dummy. They know that. They're pointing out they're
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:10.240]  creating a case. They're pushing it. They're showing it's wrong. It's the same thing with
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.560]  having an armed march on DC. You can argue and say it's a bad idea. But the Supreme Court's
[02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:19.200]  ruled you can't keep guns out of DC for law abiding citizens.
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:24.320]  So they're challenging the city violating the Supreme Court ruling and the Constitution.
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.480]  Now I'm not saying take your family, go to this. I don't like the idea because I don't
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:34.040]  wanna get a shootout going. But I know they have the right to do it. And it's provocative.
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:39.320]  I like the idea of 3D printable guns because criminals are going to get guns regardless.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:43.240]  Now joining us, ladies and gentlemen, from the United Kingdom is a guy I've wanted to
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:49.260]  get on for a long time. He's one of the founders of UKIP, with Nigel Farage, the rock star of
[02:11:49.260 --> 02:11:51.040]  Liberty Now in Europe and England.
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:54.400]  And of course, Lord Christopher Monckton. He's a member of the European Parliament for
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:12:00.120]  Yorkshire and Humber for the United Kingdom Independence Party. He was first elected in
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:06.080]  2004 and reelected in 09. Before becoming MEP, Bloom worked as a financial economist.
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:10.840]  Godfrey Bloom is the president of the European Alliance for Freedom, a Eurosceptic pan European
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:17.900]  political party. Godfrey Bloom, MEP.co.uk. And he is just an amazing, this is a founding
[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:22.260]  father level guy, folks. The people that gave us Magna Carta, the people that gave us Bill
[02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:24.780]  of Rights and Constitution, due process.
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:28.720]  The people that paid with their blood, these guys are paying with their time and their
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:32.320]  energy. And I salute God. I think he might have been on once before about five years
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:39.220]  ago. But the point is, he's on with us now. And UKIP has just had huge victories in England.
[02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:45.120]  They're having victories in the EU. Liberty is really getting popular. This is history
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:49.200]  happening. So Mr. Bloom, thanks for giving us a report from the UK on what's happening.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:52.680]  Great pleasure. Great pleasure to be on the show again. You're right. It was about five
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:53.680]  years ago. Very enjoyable.
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:57.000]  That's right. I was saying maiden voyage on the show and I went, wait a minute. I've had
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.600]  this gone before because I've seen you in parliament doing, you know, debating these
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:04.080]  people. What is the state of the world right now? You're in the middle of the EU tyranny.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:09.180]  What's happening with the EU? What's happening with UKIP? What's happening with Nigel Farage,
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:13.520]  popular worldwide. Ron Paul, popular worldwide. You're popular worldwide. Again, we're not
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.800]  bragging like narcissist egomaniacs. It's like a sonar ping. The fact that Liberty is
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:24.080]  so popular and that personalities promoting Liberty are so popular. What does that say
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:25.480]  to the plutocrats?
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:32.000]  Well, it's interesting. An interesting development now is of course that the political class
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:39.600]  who are classed apart, who behave and have many of the characteristics that the old landed
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:46.440]  aristocracy of the 18th century, they are the new aristocracy and they ride roughshod
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:54.040]  over everybody. And the divide between the political class and the ordinary people has
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:58.840]  now got to the stage that there's almost, we're getting into a sort of an electoral
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:04.360]  rebellion, which is what we've been working for for quite a long time. And we broke through,
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:10.880]  the major breakthrough was last week in our local government elections where we shot up
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:16.640]  to 25% of the vote. And that's taken an awful lot of hard work, but of course people
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:24.280]  now are beginning to say in times of recession, nobody goes to the barricades of course, when
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:29.120]  they've got a full tummy and two cars in the garage, but times are economically very
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:34.440]  hard now for ordinary people. And they're now looking very much more closely at how
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:38.880]  they are governed. They haven't done this for some time. And now they're looking at
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:43.960]  this, they're going to think, just a minute, we are being misgoverned by basically by Crooks
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:49.320]  and charlatans and they don't like it.
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:54.480]  Well very well said. So Mezzie, what I'm getting from you is that there is a global awakening
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:15:00.800]  happening and you're really seeing an even start in England. What does it mean that UKIP
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:05.400]  has had such a huge victory in the local elections nationwide?
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:16.000]  Well, this really is being looked at by everybody. It's a phenomenon and it's based on people
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.760]  having the feeling that they want to reject the political class. And of course this has
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:26.760]  also happened in Italy where they did it a different way. They elected a professional
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:34.400]  comedian which was very much their way of rejecting the political class as well. And
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:39.680]  of course we're seeing the breakdown of the Euro, the single currency, which of course
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:47.880]  was inevitable, which Nigel Farage and I have been calling now, well I was calling it at
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:53.600]  Cambridge University in the mid-1990s before it even started. It was deeply flawed, it
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:59.560]  was a political currency, it was a way of trying to jam down the throats of the people
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:11.440]  a super state of Europe, which is based broadly on a fascist style of government. And I don't
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:17.960]  use that term as a pejorative term, which is often used as just a statement of fact
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:22.440]  that there are two differences. Fascism is controlling the means of production and communism
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:27.320]  is owning the means of production. And now we've gone into a fascist state which controls
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:32.020]  the means of production. They're controlled by rules and regulations of which we have
[02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:40.200]  2,000 a year coming out of Brussels. 75% of the laws now of the United Kingdom are made
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:46.720]  in Brussels by unelected bureaucrats. That is illegal under our own constitution, it's
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:54.280]  illegal under our Bill of Rights of 1688, and it's also in breach of Her Majesty's
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:59.920]  Coronation Oath. So this whole thing has been illegal from the start and it's now beginning
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:04.720]  to show. But one of the problems that we've had, and I know you have this problem in America
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:11.240]  because I visit America quite a lot, and I have a lot of American friends, is that we
[02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:18.840]  have had a failed education system for the last two generations where young people aren't
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:25.800]  taught what their rights and what their liberties are. So for example, if you stand in front
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:30.280]  of a class in the United Kingdom, and I bet it's the same in America, and if you talk
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:38.000]  about the concept of the presumption of innocence, habeas corpus, the fundamental pillars of
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.960]  the English system of law, they will stare at you, they don't know what you're talking
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:48.840]  about. And of course, that makes it very easy, doesn't it, to take liberties away from people
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:51.480]  if they don't know that they had them to start with.
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:52.480]  That's right.
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:54.480]  Of course, it's what's been happening.
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:59.280]  A member of European Union Parliament, Mr Bloom, joins us right now, Godfrey Bloom,
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:02.200]  only got one more little short segment, he's got to go at the bottom of the hour, about
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:06.000]  to go to break, but I want to get this in here right now. What is happening, because
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:12.280]  you're inside the EU, watching it from the inside, how bad is the meltdown? What's going
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:17.840]  on with the open tyranny of the bureaucrats being tax-exempt, the Frenchies being caught,
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:20.720]  the socialists not paying their taxes, but everybody else has to?
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:25.080]  I mean, how long can this craziness go on? What's going to happen with Europe?
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:39.640]  It's already breaking down as we speak. It's already failing. It's failing, but of course,
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:49.640]  they're in denial. The parliament is in denial, and they're just pretending it's not happening.
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:55.600]  It's a bit like Hitler's bunker, they're moving imaginary armies around the Elbe, and I don't
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:58.480]  think it can last like this very much longer.
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:01.880]  Wow, I agree with you. I actually use that analogy quite a bit. I don't have anybody
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:08.480]  else use it. It's true, they're moving imaginary armies around on the bunker, and it's not
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:14.720]  real anymore, but they are still in control. So when we come back, I want to ask you where
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:18.320]  you expect it to go, how big a deal it is, because people are like, well, why do we care
[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:24.880]  of UKIP? It's like Ron Paul, folks, it's libertarian, pro-sovereignty, pro-family, anti-tyranny,
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:29.040]  pro-due process, and the media over there goes, they're fascist, they're fascist.
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:33.240]  But now the Brits and people in the UK are listening, and the people in Europe are listening
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:39.560]  and now mimicking it and going, no, no, they're real liberals. They're classical freedom people.
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:43.940]  They're Thomas Jefferson. They're William Wallace. We'll be back with a final segment
[02:19:43.940 --> 02:19:50.940]  with Godfrey Bloom, member of the European Union Parliament.
[02:20:13.940 --> 02:20:20.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:20.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:20.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:20.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:20.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:25:13.940 --> 02:25:21.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:26:13.940 --> 02:26:20.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:26:43.940 --> 02:26:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:20.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:20.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:50.940]  Thank you, Godfrey.
[02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:19.940]  I'm hoping that one country, whether it's your country or my country, will lead the
[02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:24.940]  way. We need to lead the way so people across the world can see that we can get away from
[02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:30.940]  this mercantilism. We can get out of the clutches of central banks, fraudulent and cheating
[02:29:30.940 --> 02:29:35.940]  politicians, and self-serving bureaucrats. We can do it. How it's going to actually pan
[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:39.940]  out, I don't know, but it must happen. It's got to happen.
[02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:42.940]  Absolutely. All right, Godfrey Bloom, let me say bye to you during the break. We'll
[02:29:42.940 --> 02:29:46.940]  be back with your calls and then Dr. Steve Pacinik on the Benghazi Gate situation. Stay
[02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:49.940]  with us. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:49.940 --> 02:30:00.940]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.940 --> 02:30:06.940]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[02:30:06.940 --> 02:30:11.940]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support

[02:31:00.940 --> 02:31:05.940]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:09.940]  a good-sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:14.940]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[02:31:14.940 --> 02:31:19.940]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[02:31:19.940 --> 02:31:24.940]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and
[02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:30.940]  be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:35.940]  Younggeviti. The Younggeviti products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:39.940]  need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've
[02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:46.940]  lost 37 pounds in two months, simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need. Check it

[02:33:22.940 --> 02:33:29.940]  That's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:37.940]  All right, here's what I want to do. Jam in a bunch of these calls I've been holding to
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:43.940]  comment on Benghazi, then bring Dr. Steve Pachinik on to get his take on it. And then
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:50.940]  I've got all this other news, but the globalist can be brought down. When you stop acting
[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:57.940]  like a slave, you'll start being a free person. When you stop acting like a slave, you'll
[02:33:57.940 --> 02:33:58.940]  start being a free person.
[02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:02.940]  I know our audience gets that, but you've all got to get really aggressive in your own
[02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:08.940]  area and really call bureaucrats, government people out, not just cops. Cops get all the
[02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:13.940]  heat, because they're where the rubber meets the road. Most cops are actually awake compared
[02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:18.940]  to people above them. It's time to start engaging the city council scum, the county commissioners,
[02:34:18.940 --> 02:34:22.940]  the state reps, the feds, and getting good people in there.
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:27.940]  Because we're being robbed a thousand different angles right now. Also, I get so busy on air
[02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:32.940]  I skip breaks, I don't plug products, any of that. We are funded by viewers like you.
[02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:36.940]  And also the materials we sell, all of it is stuff we believe in. The ProPeer water
[02:34:36.940 --> 02:34:42.940]  filter's discounted, 10% off promo code water. The big seed center, the best quality non-GMO,
[02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:49.940]  open pollinated, seeds at lowest prices, infowarsstore.com. The new magazine sold out, so I held back
[02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:52.940]  a little over 1,000, it's almost sold out.
[02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:55.940]  So we're selling them as individual magazines so everybody can get one, and we're holding
[02:34:55.940 --> 02:34:59.940]  back 500 for extra subscriptions. We've mailed out all the subscriptions for May, but we
[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:03.940]  held back some for new subscriptions, but that's all that's available. Get a subscription
[02:35:03.940 --> 02:35:11.940]  or buy them individually, or give a gift subscription, 888-25-33139, 888-25-33139.

[02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:38.940]  What's happening here is historical, and infowars.com is now a worldwide fulcrum of resistance.
[02:35:38.940 --> 02:35:44.940]  And we're trying to build other fulcrums of resistance. We are a factory of attack ships
[02:35:44.940 --> 02:35:54.940]  to help foster and expand other people's capabilities in swarm operations against the enemy. And
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:58.940]  we are certainly having devastating victories, devastating.
[02:35:58.940 --> 02:36:03.940]  We're in a race against time, we are actually kicking the enemy's butt right now, but they're
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:09.940]  still in control of the command system. We have got to restore freedom worldwide. So
[02:36:09.940 --> 02:36:14.940]  infowarsstore.com, please support us if you believe in this information. Let's talk to
[02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:17.940]  Jacob in Wisconsin, thanks for holding, Jacob, you're a trooper.
[02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:24.940]  Hey, Alex, huge fan. I spoke to you before about John McCain delivering the rape pills
[02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:27.940]  to Gaddafi people, like a couple years back.
[02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:31.940]  Well, I mean, they made up that Gaddafi's people were raping people like babies out
[02:36:31.940 --> 02:36:36.940]  of incubators so they could actually go and slaughter everyone in en masse. But John McCain
[02:36:36.940 --> 02:36:38.940]  is a piece of work.
[02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:44.940]  Yeah, but the reason I'm calling on Benghazi, it's kind of like a topic type call, but I
[02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:50.940]  just look at that and it's like, could any of that kind of be responsible for what we've
[02:36:50.940 --> 02:36:56.940]  seen unfolding in this and all the ambassador's death and everything? Had we not set up the
[02:36:56.940 --> 02:37:03.940]  no fly zone and been involved in all that spark of revolution? Do you think maybe that
[02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:06.940]  would not have happened to the ambassador?
[02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:12.940]  Well, they ordered security to stand down. They lied about the stand downs. They wanted
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:18.940]  him dead to cover up the weapons transfers. I appreciate your call. I mean, I just don't
[02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:26.940]  understand. I mean, maybe I'm thick-skulled or something. But yes, the West went over
[02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:30.940]  there. I get your point about McCain. They brought the Al Qaeda people into Benghazi
[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:34.940]  to launch the larger war. That was the head of the rebellion.
[02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:40.940]  Then after Gaddafi's killed, then there's a big weapons cache there of missiles. They've
[02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:44.940]  been ordering the jihadis to bring them all there and put them there so they could hand
[02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:48.940]  them out to who they wanted. And the jihadis, the head of security group for the entire
[02:37:48.940 --> 02:37:54.940]  city went and killed him. And that was all known then. This is not all breaking now.
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:59.940]  We're right again. And it wasn't hard. It was all in the international press. It's like,
[02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:04.940]  man, Alex, you were right again. I don't want people to say, you're so smart. I wanna stop
[02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:09.940]  all this. But again, it shows they're not invincible. Some people are like, this has
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:14.940]  gotta be another setup cuz there's no way this would all be coming out.
[02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:19.940]  These people are just people like us. They're a bunch of arrogant crooks that think they're
[02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:23.940]  never gonna get caught. James in Michigan, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:30.940]  Hello, I wanted to talk about that treason in Benghazi there. Our forefathers had warned
[02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:35.940]  us of those entanglements. I don't believe anything's really gonna happen other than
[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:41.940]  the dog and pony show. I believe Hillary is their baby. All these unlawful regulations
[02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:46.940]  from presidents past, including executive orders, all of them are in place for, I believe
[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:50.940]  personally, Hillary to run in 016 is first woman.
[02:38:50.940 --> 02:38:55.940]  Yeah, I mean, Hillary is a deep witch CIA since college with Clinton over in England.
[02:38:55.940 --> 02:39:02.940]  That's all been declassified. A total witch, she was under Cord Meyer. And the Republicans
[02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:06.940]  are acting like they dropped the ball. They didn't drop the ball. The Republicans are
[02:39:06.940 --> 02:39:10.940]  supporting Al Qaeda attacking Libya and Syria as well.
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:15.940]  Exactly. And what's going on here? I totally agree with Martin. These people, they want
[02:39:15.940 --> 02:39:20.940]  to be the intercessory between God and man. They don't want us to have a personal relationship.
[02:39:20.940 --> 02:39:25.940]  One other thing before the next info warrior, I'd like to plug our video. It's on YouTube
[02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:30.940]  called a dream revered. Look for it and God bless.
[02:39:30.940 --> 02:39:34.940]  God bless you. Yeah, we've closed out the contest, but if you haven't heard us post
[02:39:34.940 --> 02:39:38.940]  your video or talk about it, be sure and get it to us in email again. We've had over 400
[02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:39.940]  videos come in.
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:44.940]  One of them deals with a home invasion. It's a pro second amendment video, very powerful
[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:49.940]  that you should send anti gun people. That's up on my Twitter account, real Alex Jones,
[02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:56.940]  but extremely, extremely important information. Okay, let's go to Mark in New Jersey. You're
[02:39:56.940 --> 02:39:58.940]  on the air, Mark.
[02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:06.940]  Yeah, Alex. Yes, sir. You're on the air. Okay. Um, I got a couple of things to say. One of
[02:40:06.940 --> 02:40:13.940]  them is that definitely this Benghazi, I see this as an open door where we can get our
[02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:21.940]  foot. If we can get our politicians, representatives, whoever to push to get this, I mean, to, to
[02:40:21.940 --> 02:40:25.940]  really get this out in the open. This poor guy, Gregory Hicks, he looks, I mean, just
[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:30.940]  watching them. They are shooken up, but this is their friends that they're trying to back
[02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:32.940]  and they know that they're next.
[02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:37.940]  Oh yeah. They were ordered to stand down over those six to eight hours so they could all
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:43.940]  be killed to cover up the weapons transfer. And now it's mainstream news today that our
[02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:51.940]  government and NATO is open. The main force now in command in Syria is Al Qaeda. Here's
[02:40:51.940 --> 02:40:57.940]  the headline. Al Qaeda now in control of CIA's covert war in Syria and they have heat seeking
[02:40:57.940 --> 02:41:05.940]  missiles. And here's the deal. When they shoot down our aircraft with those missiles, we'll
[02:41:05.940 --> 02:41:09.940]  be called conspiracy theorists for pointing out our government transferred it to them.
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:13.940]  Good points. I appreciate your call. Yeah, no, this could bring them down. I mean, Nixon
[02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:20.940]  was an angel compared to this. He went to jail for, you know, breaking into some places.
[02:41:20.940 --> 02:41:25.940]  This is amazing. And I want to go to Dr. Steve Pechenik because, you know, he was the head
[02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:30.940]  of psychological warfare and hostage negotiations. He helped do the Camp David Accords, one of
[02:41:30.940 --> 02:41:34.940]  the most famous negotiations ever, the only successful real Middle East peace until the
[02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:36.940]  assassination of the leader of Egypt.
[02:41:36.940 --> 02:41:40.940]  And of course, he was one of the founders of Delta Force with General Boykin and been
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:45.940]  involved in a lot of black ops and been involved overthrowing governments. If you're a new
[02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:55.940]  person, he is here now with us, Dr. Steve Pechenik. And I want to get because back when
[02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:59.940]  all this happened, you know, he said basically they took him out. It was a stand down, same
[02:41:59.940 --> 02:42:00.940]  deal.
[02:42:00.940 --> 02:42:04.940]  Let's move on. That's what Colonel Schaefer said. That's what all my other sources have
[02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:10.940]  said. Now it's all been confirmed. A, what really happened in Benghazi in hindsight?
[02:42:10.940 --> 02:42:16.940]  B, where is this going? How big is it? And his Cheney running defense for Obama saying,
[02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:19.940]  oh, they dropped the ball. They're idiots. They should get in trouble. It didn't look
[02:42:19.940 --> 02:42:25.940]  like to me they dropped the ball. Or was it a false flag against the White House by another
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:26.940]  internal group?
[02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:30.940]  But then the White House couldn't have done that because they were in control. I mean,
[02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:33.940]  they weren't all just sleeping. So Dr. Pechenik, what do you think really happened?
[02:42:33.940 --> 02:42:38.940]  Well, it's what I said a long time ago. It's a pleasure always to be on. It's basically
[02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:43.940]  a palace coup. This was an attempt by John Brandon who illegally used what was called
[02:42:43.940 --> 02:42:49.940]  a paramilitary SOCOM command, that's Southern Command, soldiers that were offline. Offline
[02:42:49.940 --> 02:42:54.940]  meaning that it was not authorized through the BCI, Directed Central Intelligence Agency,
[02:42:54.940 --> 02:42:59.940]  but with General Petraeus. It was an attempt to get General Petraeus out when we said to
[02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:03.940]  you, and I said a long time ago to your audience, there is a war going on between the civilian
[02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:08.940]  CIA and the military intelligence General Petraeus was put in. In order to control the
[02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:13.940]  civilian CIA, he could not do that. They want to get rid of him. General Petraeus had wanted
[02:43:13.940 --> 02:43:20.940]  to arm the Syrian guards. However, he did not know about this entirely illegal organization
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:25.940]  that was authorized directly by the President of the United States to run an illegal covert
[02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:32.940]  operation. In other words, that put Obama in line of impeachment through John Brandon
[02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:37.940]  who was not an authorized elected official, but an appointed one who had worked for Bush
[02:43:37.940 --> 02:43:43.940]  Jr. who ran an illegal SOCOM unit in a unit that was called the Embassy but was not, where
[02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:48.940]  they tortured Al Paytas prisoners and used it as a transfer point for the armaments.
[02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:53.940]  And I said it a long time ago. And at that point, there was a stand-down issue. There
[02:43:53.940 --> 02:43:59.940]  were military generals, AFRICOM, General Hamm, who wanted to go in. He was told to stand
[02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:04.940]  down. He stood down. A Rear Admiral who I told you the 7th Fleet was told to stand down.
[02:44:04.940 --> 02:44:13.940]  He stood down. And then 14 other Navy officers were decommissioned. And the DCM of the Embassy
[02:44:13.940 --> 02:44:17.940]  who correctly said this is the first time Foreign Service officers had more balls than
[02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:24.940]  the military. I am ashamed of what the military did not do. This was an illegal act. The President
[02:44:24.940 --> 02:44:28.940]  should have been impeached. This is not just a small cover-up. This has nothing to do with
[02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:34.940]  Republicans, Democrats, or security operatives. I happen to know all the individuals exceedingly
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:37.940]  well. Let's go through the board that oversaw.
[02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:40.940]  By the way, let me just stop you briefly for people to understand.
[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:48.940]  And Tom has had an impeccable reputation, but he's a company man. And he lied. On that
[02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:53.940]  board, he lied. He knew very well this was an illegal operation. This was an operation
[02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:59.940]  to cover Obama. And Hillary Clinton was directly responsible for what went on, because that
[02:44:59.940 --> 02:45:05.940]  consular officer had nothing to do but keep the consulate intact. It had nothing to do
[02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:10.940]  with regional security officers. And in fact, the regional security officer who testified
[02:45:10.940 --> 02:45:15.940]  in front of the Senate was correct. This is not about more regional security officers.
[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:21.940]  This is about better capability. And the CIA destroyed Petraeus. Petraeus was furious.
[02:45:21.940 --> 02:45:26.940]  And at the same time, our friend, again, Mueller, who illegally leaked out a lot of this information,
[02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:32.940]  got rid of Petraeus. And the military really did not come forth. General Dempsey used to
[02:45:32.940 --> 02:45:39.940]  be condemned for this, because he had to authorize the stand-down from President Obama, who now
[02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:45.940]  is guilty of being a very inappropriate, incompetent military commander-in-chief. Listen to what
[02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:51.940]  I said before. I said before he was an incompetent president who was not qualified to run as
[02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:55.940]  president. Now I am accusing him of being an incompetent military command-in-chief.
[02:45:55.940 --> 02:46:01.940]  According to the laws of military law and order, he can be qualified for military tribunal
[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:06.940]  and impeachment for having done what he did, for allowing our men to die in the field of
[02:46:06.940 --> 02:46:12.940]  battle. Now, I happen to know the head of the NSA. I know for a fact that Keith Alexander
[02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:18.940]  ran two UAVs all the time so they knew exactly what was going on. However, if you look back
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:23.940]  into the history, General Dempsey lied in the beginning with the Susan Roos, a rice
[02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:28.940]  story, saying that, in fact, there was this video that went viral and it was General Dempsey
[02:46:28.940 --> 02:46:33.940]  who first said it. He should have been indicted from the moment. I kept saying that for years.
[02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:37.940]  He should have been indicted. So who was on the committee? On the committee to evaluate
[02:46:37.940 --> 02:46:44.940]  this was Admiral Mullen, again another incompetent admiral and military officer who gave us the
[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:50.940]  false flag and both the nonsense about Field Team 6 killing Osama bin Laden. And I told
[02:46:50.940 --> 02:46:56.940]  you I knew his father who had worked for William Morris. So you have incompetent generals who
[02:46:56.940 --> 02:47:02.940]  are self-aggrandizing, no longer perform, and have nothing to do with our national security.
[02:47:02.940 --> 02:47:07.940]  The Board of Overseers indicted specifically, Hillary Clinton must be indicted and a guy
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:12.940]  named Patrick Kennedy. Patrick Kennedy worked for me as an assistant administrator under
[02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:17.940]  Eagle Burger, under Carter, under Reagan, under Bush. He's a very competent, he was
[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:23.940]  a nice guy, but he is lethal because the Under Secretary for Management, as it was brought
[02:47:23.940 --> 02:47:29.940]  up by the DCM in the Senate hearings, was absolutely correct. Patrick Kennedy controls
[02:47:29.940 --> 02:47:36.940]  both the allocation of resources and controls everything in terms of disposition. Because
[02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:42.940]  when I had to go overseas and I had to take out Noriega, and I had to come back to Patrick
[02:47:42.940 --> 02:47:47.940]  Kennedy and give my administrative numbers, and I said I don't have any receipts, and
[02:47:47.940 --> 02:47:51.940]  he said well what happened? He said I was being chased, and you know my life was in
[02:47:51.940 --> 02:47:54.940]  line. He said well you got to pay me back in the government. That was Patrick Kennedy.
[02:47:54.940 --> 02:48:00.940]  The Uriah heap of the State Department. He has to be investigated. Dick Green has to
[02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:05.940]  be investigated. Hillary Clinton. Now the key element here is Eric Boswell, who was
[02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:10.940]  the Secretary of, the Assistant Secretary of Diplomatic Security. I've known him
[02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:15.940]  since the day of the Eagle Burger. This is a very straightforward, honorable man who
[02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:21.940]  took the sword for Hillary Clinton and Patrick Kennedy. They go back 30 years, and in turn
[02:48:21.940 --> 02:48:27.940]  two took the lies on behalf of Tom Pickering. You have a Foreign Service that did not act
[02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:33.940]  appropriately with regards to the DCM who was on the ground, with regards to an Ambassador
[02:48:33.940 --> 02:48:37.940]  who was an outstanding Ambassador and had nothing to do with the excellent regional
[02:48:37.940 --> 02:48:43.940]  security officers. What this was, was a coup attempt to take out Petraeus, to take out
[02:48:43.940 --> 02:48:48.940]  the military from running the CIA and covert operatives that no one knew about and were
[02:48:48.940 --> 02:48:56.940]  not even on the books authorized by President Obama, by Biden, Donlan, and all of the
[02:48:56.940 --> 02:49:02.940]  So it's about covering up a CIA secret army with jihadis and Al Qaeda. It's about
[02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:04.940]  covering up a secret Al Qaeda army.
[02:49:04.940 --> 02:49:09.940]  Because the DCI knew about the Al Qaeda. He was running that unit. This was even beyond
[02:49:09.940 --> 02:49:15.940]  that, if you can believe, double secret probation challenge. This was the unit that was created
[02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:20.940]  way beyond anything to do under the jurisdiction of Petraeus. This was a unit that we call
[02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:27.940]  way offline that had to do with special officers, special forces on contract, which was really
[02:49:27.940 --> 02:49:32.940]  off the books. It's so illegal, I can't even tell you. I worked off the books. Once
[02:49:32.940 --> 02:49:36.940]  you work offline, you don't get paid, you don't have anything. I've never been paid.
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:42.940]  But if you're captured, you have no official cover. John Brennan was authorized to do that
[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:44.940]  by the President of the United States.
[02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:49.940]  Was Blackwater involved? Was Blackwater involved? Because I know they were heavily in that area.
[02:49:49.940 --> 02:49:51.940]  I'm sorry?
[02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:55.940]  Did you pick, you came on two weeks after it happened and said all this. Same thing
[02:49:55.940 --> 02:49:56.940]  you're saying now.
[02:49:56.940 --> 02:50:00.940]  I did a little bit. Nobody believed me. But the one who did believe me, besides you, was
[02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:06.940]  Rupert Murdoch and the New York Post and Fox. And I'll tell you why. Rupert Murdoch ordered
[02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:11.940]  a book called Benghazi dispatch. And in that dispatch, in a book done by William Morrow,
[02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:16.940]  he described it to the detail. So there were those who picked it up very quickly, like
[02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:22.940]  yourself. And you got to give the Fox News the credit as well as you to keep on the story
[02:50:22.940 --> 02:50:26.940]  because they wouldn't let it go. And they were correct. This is not just the cover up.
[02:50:26.940 --> 02:50:30.940]  This makes Watergate look like baby stuff. This makes Clinton impeachment looks like
[02:50:30.940 --> 02:50:31.940]  nothing.
[02:50:31.940 --> 02:50:32.940]  All right, I want you to talk to me like I'm five.
[02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:37.940]  Criminal offense committed by the President of the United States, Hillary Clinton and
[02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:40.940]  John Brennan and General Dempsey.
[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:46.940]  Doc, I got to go to break. I got to go to break. I want to come back. I want you to
[02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:50.940]  talk to me like I'm five years old. I mean, I want you to break down the whole story,
[02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:55.940]  why they did it, where you think it's going, because they've been caught. How big is this?
[02:50:55.940 --> 02:51:00.940]  I mean, this is incredible. A double secret al Qaeda army given a missiles.
[02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:04.940]  Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids have to be delivered to your body
[02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:08.940]  in the shape that nature gave them. If they are to be used to create new proteins in your
[02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:13.940]  body, just like a bricklayer cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a brick wall.
[02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:17.940]  So, too, your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.
[02:51:17.940 --> 02:51:22.940]  Given your body and undamaged amino acid food can make a huge difference in your health.
[02:51:22.940 --> 02:51:26.940]  One world way is an undamaged amino acid food unlike any other.
[02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:31.940]  You see, heating bends and twists amino acids and all whey protein powders we've investigated
[02:51:31.940 --> 02:51:36.940]  and most proteins you consume are heated with our true cool process.
[02:51:36.940 --> 02:51:38.940]  You now have a choice with One World Whey.
[02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:44.940]  My name is Daniel. I'm 34 years old. When I started using One World Whey, I weighed 228 pounds.
[02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:49.940]  Now, after two and a half months, I weigh 182 pounds. This is my ideal weight.
[02:51:49.940 --> 02:51:54.940]  I've noticed an increase in stamina, rate of recovery from workouts, and an increase in my potency.
[02:51:54.940 --> 02:51:59.940]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[02:51:59.940 --> 02:52:03.940]  Are you one of the millions of Americans worried about change?
[02:52:03.940 --> 02:52:07.940]  Do you lose sleep over what could happen to your assets and hard-earned money?
[02:52:07.940 --> 02:52:11.940]  Are you looking for a better way of life with more freedom, security, and asset protection?
[02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:16.940]  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you should consider investing in the country of Belize.
[02:52:16.940 --> 02:52:23.940]  Belize is an independent English-speaking country only hours from the U.S. with strong banking and asset protection laws.
[02:52:23.940 --> 02:52:27.940]  In fact, Belize is one of the last tax havens left in the world today.
[02:52:27.940 --> 02:52:31.940]  Belize also has a very low cost of living, tropical climate,
[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:34.940]  and is home to some of the best real estate opportunities in the world.
[02:52:34.940 --> 02:52:40.940]  To find out more, call 800-793-2600 or go to BuyBelize.com.
[02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:47.940]  So if you're frustrated, nervous, and worried about change, go to BuyBelize.com to invest and secure your future.
[02:52:47.940 --> 02:52:59.940]  Don't wait, or it may be too late. Call 800-793-2600. That's 800-793-2600. Again, 800-793-2600.
[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:05.940]  Hey there. My name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[02:53:05.940 --> 02:53:11.940]  Some people think the answer is gold. Others think it's a gun. But the correct answer will shock you.
[02:53:11.940 --> 02:53:19.940]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:25.940]  Ninety-seven percent of Americans don't have this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[02:53:25.940 --> 02:53:33.940]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:38.940]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[02:53:38.940 --> 02:53:45.940]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked.
[02:53:45.940 --> 02:53:50.940]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:53:50.940 --> 02:53:59.940]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[02:54:20.940 --> 02:54:30.940]  Again, I want to be clear. I'm not up here saying, oh, we were so right. Aren't we great?
[02:54:30.940 --> 02:54:37.940]  This all came out with our guests, Pacenik especially, but Colonel Shaffer and others.
[02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:43.940]  And it was clear. I mean, the Al Qaeda forces knew right where to hit. It was the group they hired for security.
[02:54:43.940 --> 02:54:49.940]  Of course, it wasn't a video that did it. And so explain to me slowly, because I know you did it back when it happened.
[02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:54.940]  But now with all the new info, why do something this crazy?
[02:54:54.940 --> 02:55:01.940]  How do they think they blame Petraeus, who you predicted they'd go after before they did a couple of years ago here on the show?
[02:55:01.940 --> 02:55:08.940]  You said there was a fight between the civilian CIA and the Pentagon. And then now where does this go?
[02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:19.940]  But explain it to people in just boiled down, layman terms, what this compartmentalized group did and why they wanted the ambassador dead.
[02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:21.940]  And again, where this goes now.
[02:55:21.940 --> 02:55:29.940]  The real issue is very simple, really. You've got to think of two elements of the government fighting each other that are covert.
[02:55:29.940 --> 02:55:37.940]  The government is never unified. It never has been unified. For over 30 to 40 years, there's always been a conflict between the CIA and the military.
[02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:46.940]  And the CIA and the FBI. You just saw that conflict of the CIA and the FBI in the Boston Massacre, where there was no sharing of information.
[02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:55.940]  The CIA has been running for the past 50 years by civilians who have been out of control. Eisenhower warned us about it and called Legacy of Ashes.
[02:55:55.940 --> 02:56:04.940]  He told Allen Dulles, you've got to shut down this CIA. It's creating a disaster. Jimmy Carter tried to get rid of 4,000.
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:12.940]  Reagan brought them back in. These are guys who were really not trained very well in either human or paramilitary units.
[02:56:12.940 --> 02:56:20.940]  But what they did was, under Panetta, under John Brennan, who was not really an operative but came out of the investigative report,
[02:56:20.940 --> 02:56:28.940]  they started to create paramilitary units that infringed on the military. In other words, they started to do drone warfare, which was illegal.
[02:56:28.940 --> 02:56:36.940]  And Obama was brought up on that charge. They started to kill thousands of people that were illegal, both in Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan.
[02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:44.940]  They started to create a civil war in Pakistan between the Pakistani Army, ISI, and the CIA, but they didn't say anything.
[02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:52.940]  And our legislators allowed this to happen. In the meantime, Hillary Clinton went around the world in 168 countries, had nothing to do,
[02:56:52.940 --> 02:57:00.940]  was totally incompetent, and really was allowing all of this to be run between John Brennan and the White House, who was only appointed.
[02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:09.940]  He was not elected. And John Brennan has been there since Bush Jr., since Clinton. So it goes all the way back to Clinton, back to Hillary Clinton.
[02:57:09.940 --> 02:57:19.940]  And John Brennan ordered a very secret unit that was never even registered or on the books, which is called Offline Off the Books, as Hicks said, the DCM.
[02:57:19.940 --> 02:57:33.940]  And basically, that unit was used to create another counterforce against Petraeus and the CIA and his al-Qaeda units, which were legally charged with creating armed shipment into Syria.
[02:57:33.940 --> 02:57:41.940]  In other words, the legal covert arm that Petraeus was doing was being undermined by a unit that he knew nothing about.
[02:57:41.940 --> 02:57:51.940]  He was blindsided purposely by John Brennan, the president of the United States, Obama, and including his vice president, Biden, and all the people in the White House,
[02:57:51.940 --> 02:57:57.940]  in order to get rid of Petraeus and the military overseeing of the CIA.
[02:57:57.940 --> 02:58:08.940]  And what happened is, at the same time that the Benghazi occurred, which was really not even an embassy, it was a counselor unit where they tortured people and terrorists, so-called terrorists,
[02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:17.940]  and were shipping guns at the same time. The ambassador happened to be a target of opportunity. He was not really the actual target intended.
[02:58:17.940 --> 02:58:23.940]  He was killed on a sideline, as was the DCM, who said it very clearly. This was a terrorist attack.
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:28.940]  All right, Doc, stay there. We got to go to break. I'm going to go into overdrive for at least 20 minutes here with Dr. Steve Pacinek.
[02:58:28.940 --> 02:58:36.940]  And then after that, your phone calls for folks that have been patient. But this has all come out. This is no longer Pacinek's seven months ago saying this.
[02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:39.940]  It's all confirmed, folks. It's incredible.
[02:59:06.940 --> 02:59:11.940]  We've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfowarsShop.com.
[02:59:11.940 --> 02:59:15.940]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

[02:59:20.940 --> 02:59:25.940]  The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:59:25.940 --> 02:59:28.940]  Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.

[02:59:51.940 --> 02:59:54.940]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:54.940 --> 03:00:04.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:04.940 --> 03:00:09.940]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[03:00:09.940 --> 03:00:12.940]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[03:00:12.940 --> 03:00:16.940]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:16.940 --> 03:00:37.940]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:40.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into the fourth hour of overdrive.
[03:00:40.940 --> 03:00:46.940]  Dr. Steve Pacinek's our guest, and he was breaking down what really happened in Benghazi.
[03:00:46.940 --> 03:00:48.940]  And now, it's all out in the open.
[03:00:48.940 --> 03:00:50.940]  Finish up what you were getting into about what happened there.
[03:00:50.940 --> 03:00:57.940]  In the next long segment, I want to get into what the political ramifications of this means.
[03:00:57.940 --> 03:01:01.940]  Because they're now on the news saying, we listen to everything you do.
[03:01:01.940 --> 03:01:04.940]  And we've been recording everything for ten years.
[03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:05.940]  That's just admitting felonies.
[03:01:05.940 --> 03:01:08.940]  And they're back on the news going, we do torture, and it's okay.
[03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:11.940]  And we're taking $85 billion a month from you.
[03:01:11.940 --> 03:01:15.940]  And it's like when criminals, I've studied psychopaths, I know you're a psychiatrist.
[03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:19.940]  After they've gotten away with like 20 murders, they start getting real reckless.
[03:01:19.940 --> 03:01:22.940]  I guess at a subconscious level, they want to be caught.
[03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:26.940]  I'll let you, the psychiatrist, explain it to us in the next segment, or tell me if you disagree.
[03:01:26.940 --> 03:01:29.940]  But it does seem like they've gone completely insane.
[03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:32.940]  And Hillary throwing fits going, what difference does it make?
[03:01:32.940 --> 03:01:35.940]  I mean, these people would be a joke if they weren't so dangerous.
[03:01:35.940 --> 03:01:38.940]  You're correct, Alex.
[03:01:38.940 --> 03:01:43.940]  The real issue is, and I've said it for years, Hillary Clinton is a very dangerous individual.
[03:01:43.940 --> 03:01:45.940]  To say she's a sociopath is undermining.
[03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:47.940]  She's really bored of you.
[03:01:47.940 --> 03:01:51.940]  I mean, she has evil personification as well as Clinton.
[03:01:51.940 --> 03:01:53.940]  This is a very dangerous individual.
[03:01:53.940 --> 03:01:56.940]  The fact that she happens to be a woman is irrelevant.
[03:01:56.940 --> 03:02:01.940]  The deaths that she has from foster on or otherwise outward is really irrelevant.
[03:02:01.940 --> 03:02:04.940]  She should have been indicted and put in prison a long time ago.
[03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:06.940]  She was culpable.
[03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:09.940]  She is directly culpable because she knew exactly what happened.
[03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:15.940]  In order to cover up this callous coup against Petraeus, they used the State Department,
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:17.940]  and they used the very people whom I knew.
[03:02:17.940 --> 03:02:21.940]  In particular, they used a guy by the name of Patrick Kennedy who worked for me.
[03:02:21.940 --> 03:02:24.940]  He's now the Undersecretary for Management.
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:31.940]  Now, to say an Undersecretary of Management at State is talking about an individual who can manipulate all the funds,
[03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:34.940]  all the positions, and all the careers that's involved.
[03:02:34.940 --> 03:02:40.940]  So the DCM in Libya was absolutely correct when he said everything that nobody really questioned him.
[03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:46.940]  They tried to keep him quiet, and Patrick Kennedy really tried to threaten him.
[03:02:46.940 --> 03:02:48.940]  Patrick, I've known since he was a kid.
[03:02:48.940 --> 03:02:49.940]  He worked for me.
[03:02:49.940 --> 03:02:52.940]  But he's very much of the Uriah Heep and very Maggie Elliot.
[03:02:52.940 --> 03:02:56.940]  You don't get to the top after 30 years unless you really play the system.
[03:02:56.940 --> 03:03:05.940]  In turn, his boss was really Tom Pickering, who was asked to be on a committee to oversee this entire lie
[03:03:05.940 --> 03:03:11.940]  where Brennan was trying to take out Petraeus, where, in fact, politically we were getting into very serious problems
[03:03:11.940 --> 03:03:18.940]  of arms shipment in Syria, which Petraeus had wanted, I was against, Hillary Clinton wanted, I was against.
[03:03:18.940 --> 03:03:24.940]  But Brennan undercut everybody at the same time, not because it was for political reasons, it was for personal reasons.
[03:03:24.940 --> 03:03:33.940]  So for two reasons at the same time, both an illegal shipment of arms and an illegal undercutting of our own DCI.
[03:03:33.940 --> 03:03:36.940]  Sure, how does doing that undermine Petraeus?
[03:03:36.940 --> 03:03:39.940]  We know they got rid of him after that, the FBI was illegally spying on him.
[03:03:39.940 --> 03:03:41.940]  So now we get Mueller in here.
[03:03:41.940 --> 03:03:46.940]  Now, don't forget, Bob Mueller has also been implicated in the Boston massacre.
[03:03:46.940 --> 03:03:51.940]  Remember what I said, he was the assistant attorney general in Massachusetts for counterterrorism.
[03:03:51.940 --> 03:03:56.940]  He knew all about the governor, who was one of his law partners.
[03:03:56.940 --> 03:03:59.940]  He was in charge of counterterrorism in Massachusetts.
[03:03:59.940 --> 03:04:02.940]  He knew exactly where the CIA had come in.
[03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:07.940]  He knew exactly that the Russians had asked the CIA repeatedly as to where it is.
[03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:14.940]  So Mueller, once again, is involved in undercutting one of our operatives, in other words, the director of the FBI.
[03:04:14.940 --> 03:04:19.940]  So again, you have these criminals who are continuously overseeing so-called national security.
[03:04:19.940 --> 03:04:25.940]  That's Obama, Biden, Brennan, Mueller, Hillary working in concert.
[03:04:25.940 --> 03:04:32.940]  But this time they bring in a Tom Pickering who had all the accoutrements of a great ambassador, and I personally liked him.
[03:04:32.940 --> 03:04:38.940]  I wrote a nice blog about him, but I was totally disappointed because he besmirched his reputation as integrity.
[03:04:38.940 --> 03:04:39.940]  Incredible, incredible.
[03:04:39.940 --> 03:04:44.940]  And he lied because he said this was just a problem of regional security offices.
[03:04:44.940 --> 03:04:46.940]  Sure, sure, and they've been caught lying everywhere.
[03:04:46.940 --> 03:04:49.940]  We've got to go to break. We're going to come right back.
[03:04:49.940 --> 03:04:53.940]  You'll have the floor to break down where this goes now.
[03:04:53.940 --> 03:04:55.940]  And this is incredible, folks.
[03:04:55.940 --> 03:04:58.940]  This is a meltdown of biblical proportions.
[03:04:58.940 --> 03:05:20.940]  This is real what you're saying.

[03:05:45.940 --> 03:05:51.940]  the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[03:07:06.940 --> 03:07:13.940]  Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars.
[03:07:13.940 --> 03:07:16.940]  Fool the bad guys with a new, improved fake TV.
[03:07:16.940 --> 03:07:23.940]  You asked for it, we listened, and we made our new fake TV three times brighter than our previous model.
[03:07:23.940 --> 03:07:27.940]  The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent to a 40-inch TV.
[03:07:27.940 --> 03:07:32.940]  It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from home.
[03:07:32.940 --> 03:07:39.940]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.
[03:07:39.940 --> 03:07:44.940]  The new, brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and includes free shipping.

[03:07:56.940 --> 03:07:59.940]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[03:07:59.940 --> 03:08:08.940]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:09.940 --> 03:08:15.940]  Well, on that last three-minute break, Dr. Steve Pechenik, former head of psychological warfare operations at the State Department,
[03:08:15.940 --> 03:08:21.940]  trained and knows many of the people that are involved today, what he laid out.
[03:08:21.940 --> 03:08:28.940]  And I study it every day, I've got all the pieces, he's dead on, but he doesn't just see it like I do from the outside, he knows it.
[03:08:28.940 --> 03:08:33.940]  And everything he told us back seven months ago, a few weeks after this happened, has now been proven.
[03:08:33.940 --> 03:08:35.940]  How will the system survive?
[03:08:35.940 --> 03:08:41.940]  I mean, I don't think the Republicans can just try to score political points here and say, oh, they screwed up.
[03:08:41.940 --> 03:08:46.940]  This is something that makes what Nixon did pale in significance.
[03:08:46.940 --> 03:08:53.940]  Dr. Pechenik, can you repeat what you said during the break about what this signifies, where it's going, what needs to be done?
[03:08:53.940 --> 03:08:56.940]  And I said, maybe they're going to stage a new false flag.
[03:08:56.940 --> 03:08:59.940]  You said another Boston Massacre won't do it.
[03:08:59.940 --> 03:09:02.940]  So get into all of it right now, Dr. Steve Pechenik.
[03:09:02.940 --> 03:09:06.940]  All right, this is far more serious than a Watergate.
[03:09:06.940 --> 03:09:09.940]  This is the Watergate on steroids for Obama.
[03:09:09.940 --> 03:09:11.940]  Obama must be stopped and impeached.
[03:09:11.940 --> 03:09:19.940]  There has to be a special prosecutor assigned to investigate Obama's involvement in both this, Osama bin Laden,
[03:09:19.940 --> 03:09:28.940]  Benghazi affair, the legalities that were involved, as well as John Brennan, Dempsey, and Pickering and Hillary Clinton.
[03:09:28.940 --> 03:09:30.940]  It has to be an independent prosecutor.
[03:09:30.940 --> 03:09:32.940]  It cannot be a legislator.
[03:09:32.940 --> 03:09:37.940]  The legislators were co-opted, in particular Diane Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, and others.
[03:09:37.940 --> 03:09:42.940]  I questioned E.S.I. as well, because many had to know what was happening on.
[03:09:42.940 --> 03:09:47.940]  Secondly, they have to release the secret documents that were done on the investigation.
[03:09:47.940 --> 03:09:48.940]  They're not secret.
[03:09:48.940 --> 03:09:50.940]  They cannot affect the national security.
[03:09:50.940 --> 03:09:59.940]  Thirdly, Dempsey has to be evaluated by a court of military justice for illegal activities committed against his own men and for the stand-down.
[03:09:59.940 --> 03:10:06.940]  Every general who stood down and every neighbor admiral who stood down has to be investigated under military tribunal law,
[03:10:06.940 --> 03:10:13.940]  as well as every special forces unit that was used illegally by military law and prosecutors.
[03:10:13.940 --> 03:10:21.940]  Everyone below the level of the general at the colonel and major level can and refuse any command from the commander-in-chief.
[03:10:21.940 --> 03:10:27.940]  What I'm saying, in effect, is you can now disobey the commander-in-chief because he has committed a crime,
[03:10:27.940 --> 03:10:30.940]  and a crime against his own soldiers and American people.
[03:10:30.940 --> 03:10:35.940]  The last point is that all of these people have to be indicted, have to go to prison.
[03:10:35.940 --> 03:10:38.940]  Otherwise, our system will break apart.
[03:10:38.940 --> 03:10:45.940]  What is happening politically on the geopolitical level is that, once again, the CIA, Petraeus, unfortunately, and Hillary,
[03:10:45.940 --> 03:10:51.940]  and now William Burns of the State Department have decided to arm the Syrian opposition,
[03:10:51.940 --> 03:10:59.940]  which is really nothing more than Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia, from the Saudi princes who are totally corrupt and inefficient,
[03:10:59.940 --> 03:11:04.940]  who have been propped up by the CIA for over 30 years to take down Bashar Assad.
[03:11:04.940 --> 03:11:06.940]  They will not take down Bashar Assad.
[03:11:06.940 --> 03:11:07.940]  The Russians will help them.
[03:11:07.940 --> 03:11:08.940]  The Iranians will help them.
[03:11:08.940 --> 03:11:10.940]  The Chinese will help them.
[03:11:10.940 --> 03:11:11.940]  The war will continue.
[03:11:11.940 --> 03:11:14.940]  This was initiated by the CIA.
[03:11:14.940 --> 03:11:19.940]  This was initiated by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and King of Jordan.
[03:11:19.940 --> 03:11:26.940]  Israel attacked as it needed to attack, but really doesn't have a stake in the game other than to keep out of this
[03:11:26.940 --> 03:11:28.940]  and make sure that Israel doesn't take armament.
[03:11:28.940 --> 03:11:35.940]  So we're heading into a potential third world war thanks to all of the disaster of an incompetent criminal president,
[03:11:35.940 --> 03:11:41.940]  an incompetent criminal vice president, an incompetent John Brennan, now as the CIA director,
[03:11:41.940 --> 03:11:47.940]  an incompetent chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, an incompetent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
[03:11:47.940 --> 03:11:49.940]  and questionable competency of John Kerry.
[03:11:49.940 --> 03:11:55.940]  And that means that the American public now has to say, we had enough, and either we have an election,
[03:11:55.940 --> 03:12:01.940]  an immediate election, and a recall, and a massive impeachment request for the special prosecutor.
[03:12:01.940 --> 03:12:03.940]  This is way beyond Watergate.
[03:12:03.940 --> 03:12:07.940]  This is way beyond anything that Bill Clinton did, as much as I despise him.
[03:12:07.940 --> 03:12:12.940]  But this does indict the Secretary of State, the president of the United States, the vice president,
[03:12:12.940 --> 03:12:19.940]  the director of the CIA now, John Brennan, and all of the men involved in the special forces unit that was an illegal unit,
[03:12:19.940 --> 03:12:23.940]  as well as all the military generals who stood down in the rear admirals,
[03:12:23.940 --> 03:12:29.940]  must be evaluated by the commanding officers or officers below them in a military court of tribunal
[03:12:29.940 --> 03:12:33.940]  and tried for disregard of military arms procedure.
[03:12:33.940 --> 03:12:41.940]  And the State Department has to be stripped of Pat Kennedy, of the Secretary of State.
[03:12:41.940 --> 03:12:45.940]  Kerry has to be questioned. He's totally incompetent. Pat Kennedy must be thrown out.
[03:12:45.940 --> 03:12:51.940]  Eric Boswell must be questioned because he was in charge of the regional security officer.
[03:12:51.940 --> 03:12:53.940]  And there must be a release of a secret.
[03:12:53.940 --> 03:12:55.940]  And that's starting, that's starting.
[03:12:55.940 --> 03:12:59.940]  Dr. Perchenik, that's starting. They're dragging them all in, as you know.
[03:12:59.940 --> 03:13:01.940]  Let me ask you this question, because you know all these people.
[03:13:01.940 --> 03:13:08.940]  You run the State Department, ran major sections, ran the operations at Camp David.
[03:13:08.940 --> 03:13:11.940]  So let me ask you this question.
[03:13:11.940 --> 03:13:14.940]  If they were trying to embarrass Petraeus, it all blew back on them.
[03:13:14.940 --> 03:13:17.940]  They got Petraeus. That's all come out spying on him.
[03:13:17.940 --> 03:13:22.940]  There's this internal war over the power that the founders counted on to keep total tyranny from coming in,
[03:13:22.940 --> 03:13:25.940]  the separation of powers. It's saving us again.
[03:13:25.940 --> 03:13:30.940]  What do you expect to get done? I hear you saying what needs to be done. I agree with you.
[03:13:30.940 --> 03:13:36.940]  What do you expect them to do? Because they're not going to be able to put this back in the bottle of this genie.
[03:13:36.940 --> 03:13:39.940]  I believe they will stage false flags.
[03:13:39.940 --> 03:13:45.940]  Well, they will keep stalling it and focus on totally irrelevant issues like more security.
[03:13:45.940 --> 03:13:48.940]  And you hear these legislators talk absolute nonsense.
[03:13:48.940 --> 03:13:52.940]  What has to happen is the United â€“ the public, your public and the public in general,
[03:13:52.940 --> 03:13:56.940]  Murdoch, the New York Times and others have been very helpful in the Huffington Post
[03:13:56.940 --> 03:14:01.940]  to ask for immediate recall of the legislators, including the President of the United States,
[03:14:01.940 --> 03:14:04.940]  like we did a recall of the Governor, recall of the Vice President.
[03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:10.940]  This is the beginning of a new democracy, and this is a redefinition of what it means to be in the 21st century
[03:14:10.940 --> 03:14:15.940]  when our military cannot reform adequately, when they no longer serve our national security,
[03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:19.940]  and when the CIA is destructive to our own national security.
[03:14:19.940 --> 03:14:23.940]  I know you've been a senior guy on the CFR. You say it's a debating club now.
[03:14:23.940 --> 03:14:27.940]  But in the Pentagon, in the CFR, in the different sectors of power,
[03:14:27.940 --> 03:14:33.940]  is the sense that this is the end of not just Obama but this entire group?
[03:14:33.940 --> 03:14:37.940]  Because there is a desperation throughout the system that I've talked to people behind the scenes.
[03:14:37.940 --> 03:14:39.940]  They're all freaked out too.
[03:14:39.940 --> 03:14:45.940]  That's correct, Alice. In a way, what you're seeing is the more intelligent units that concentrate on geopolitical,
[03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:52.940]  like Stratford and others, are really moving towards your area, Austin, Texas, and further south where I'm located.
[03:14:52.940 --> 03:14:54.940]  The Northeast is no longer relevant.
[03:14:54.940 --> 03:14:59.940]  What you have is these think tanks with a lot of liberals and non-liberals, Rich Williamson.
[03:14:59.940 --> 03:15:01.940]  You have a whole bunch of guys who represented Mitt Romney.
[03:15:01.940 --> 03:15:03.940]  They didn't know what they were talking about.
[03:15:03.940 --> 03:15:08.940]  The Brookings Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation.
[03:15:08.940 --> 03:15:10.940]  They're nothing but welfare institutions.
[03:15:10.940 --> 03:15:16.940]  They're nothing but institutions which allow people to live their life without having produced anything.
[03:15:16.940 --> 03:15:17.940]  The money has to be stopped.
[03:15:17.940 --> 03:15:23.940]  So you've got a bunch of spoiled brats pretending to be James Bond on power trips.
[03:15:23.940 --> 03:15:26.940]  Well, it's not only that. There is no James Bond.
[03:15:26.940 --> 03:15:30.940]  The CIA has never been effective in really taking out anybody.
[03:15:30.940 --> 03:15:31.940]  That's why I went out on my own.
[03:15:31.940 --> 03:15:34.940]  I never used CIA. I was never part of the CIA.
[03:15:34.940 --> 03:15:38.940]  But often the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, backed me up.
[03:15:38.940 --> 03:15:42.940]  The CIA is a very incompetent organization replete, unfortunately,
[03:15:42.940 --> 03:15:49.940]  with Irish Catholic individuals who follow a hierarchical system who, instead of following the Holy Father,
[03:15:49.940 --> 03:15:53.940]  follows the Holy President or whatever system tells them to do what they do.
[03:15:53.940 --> 03:15:54.940]  It's not an accident.
[03:15:54.940 --> 03:15:58.940]  They're Donlin, they're Brennan, they're Biden.
[03:15:58.940 --> 03:16:01.940]  They're all Irish things, McDermott, Rhodes.
[03:16:01.940 --> 03:16:07.940]  I mean, you really have a system that really attracts a certain type of individual that needs a hierarchy,
[03:16:07.940 --> 03:16:13.940]  that claims that they're serving national security, when in fact they're destructive of national security.
[03:16:13.940 --> 03:16:19.940]  Our national security is really quite safe as long as we get rid of those who destroy it, which is the CIA.
[03:16:19.940 --> 03:16:21.940]  Our military has been very destructive.
[03:16:21.940 --> 03:16:26.940]  The military-industrial complex, including Halliburton, SAIC, L3 communication,
[03:16:26.940 --> 03:16:31.940]  Northrop Grumman, Bell helicopters, all useless. We don't need any of that now.
[03:16:31.940 --> 03:16:36.940]  We're getting into cyber war and cyber terror, which is probably the most important issue,
[03:16:36.940 --> 03:16:40.940]  but I don't need all these soldiers who are having sex scandals and can't fight
[03:16:40.940 --> 03:16:43.940]  and no longer are able to fight any enemies.
[03:16:43.940 --> 03:16:45.940]  We're creating the very enemies we don't need.
[03:16:45.940 --> 03:16:49.940]  Yeah, let's explain what you say about the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of.
[03:16:49.940 --> 03:16:54.940]  They go start wars and fund al-Qaeda so they then have something to fight later,
[03:16:54.940 --> 03:17:01.940]  and it helps their interest, but they're destroying the entire tree they're sitting in, the United States.
[03:17:01.940 --> 03:17:05.940]  Correct. In the meantime, however, the good news is we have construction companies,
[03:17:05.940 --> 03:17:11.940]  we have individuals who understand that this is totally, totally inappropriate American society.
[03:17:11.940 --> 03:17:15.940]  In the 21st century, we're doing exactly what our founding fathers did,
[03:17:15.940 --> 03:17:19.940]  which is to have a revolution and a peaceful way through the Internet
[03:17:19.940 --> 03:17:22.940]  with people who I don't know about, anonymous people.
[03:17:22.940 --> 03:17:25.940]  Sure, sure. People that agree with each other working in different ways.
[03:17:25.940 --> 03:17:29.940]  What's going to happen? From the insiders right now, where is all this going?
[03:17:29.940 --> 03:17:31.940]  How much trouble is Obama in?
[03:17:31.940 --> 03:17:33.940]  The insiders have no idea what they're doing.
[03:17:33.940 --> 03:17:35.940]  Basically, they're the gang who couldn't shoot straight.
[03:17:35.940 --> 03:17:39.940]  You know, we always assume that the FBI knows what they're doing. They don't.
[03:17:39.940 --> 03:17:45.940]  For 30 years, I couldn't get the FBI to repel off the helicopters and do anything really in hostage negotiation,
[03:17:45.940 --> 03:17:48.940]  yet they portray themselves in movies as if they know what they're doing.
[03:17:48.940 --> 03:17:52.940]  I told you Mueller was a disaster. He was brought in on 9-11.
[03:17:52.940 --> 03:17:56.940]  He had been compromised before that. He had been compromised after that.
[03:17:56.940 --> 03:17:59.940]  Osama bin Laden is now compromised in Gaza.
[03:17:59.940 --> 03:18:03.940]  I told you Hillary Clinton has been a disaster and a corrupt.
[03:18:03.940 --> 03:18:07.940]  She has to be taken out. She can no longer serve in our country.
[03:18:07.940 --> 03:18:11.940]  She can no longer be available. She is a criminal, as is Obama.
[03:18:11.940 --> 03:18:14.940]  And she's using the blackmail, right? That's why she's so powerful.
[03:18:14.940 --> 03:18:17.940]  Doesn't she have the biggest files?
[03:18:17.940 --> 03:18:21.940]  Well, she has the biggest files, but the bottom line is, if you look at the Obama administration,
[03:18:21.940 --> 03:18:28.940]  they're nothing more than retread Clinton people who were disasters than they were retread Carter individuals.
[03:18:28.940 --> 03:18:31.940]  None of these guys are originals who came out of anywhere.
[03:18:31.940 --> 03:18:33.940]  We do have very talented individuals.
[03:18:33.940 --> 03:18:40.940]  I would say I would do what Eisenhower, George Marshall did, and John George Marshall did,
[03:18:40.940 --> 03:18:45.940]  and I would fire the first 600 generals, admirals, and Air Force generals because they're totally useless.
[03:18:45.940 --> 03:18:52.940]  We don't have a war, and I would start to promote our captains and majors and force them to say,
[03:18:52.940 --> 03:18:56.940]  okay, enough is enough. Either you stay in the military or you get rid of your superior.
[03:18:56.940 --> 03:18:59.940]  By the way, what you mentioned is true. They've never done this.
[03:18:59.940 --> 03:19:02.940]  600 generals and all of these in competence.
[03:19:02.940 --> 03:19:05.940]  Easily we could get rid of Panetta, who should have been indicted.
[03:19:05.940 --> 03:19:10.940]  Easily we could have gotten rid of Hillary Clinton, and we could have gotten out.
[03:19:10.940 --> 03:19:14.940]  Tom Pickering has to be evaluated. Pat Kennedy should be fired.
[03:19:14.940 --> 03:19:16.940]  Bob Boswell should be investigated.
[03:19:16.940 --> 03:19:23.940]  Every one of the so-called securitizer information that was classified has to be opened up by an independent committee.
[03:19:23.940 --> 03:19:28.940]  I do not trust Feinstein. I do not trust Pelosi. I do not trust any of them.
[03:19:28.940 --> 03:19:30.940]  It has to be an independent process.
[03:19:30.940 --> 03:19:33.940]  All right, let me ask you a question as a psychiatrist, and not just a quack one,
[03:19:33.940 --> 03:19:36.940]  but somebody that's done famous negotiations, co-written books with Tom Clancy.
[03:19:36.940 --> 03:19:40.940]  I just throw that out, not for any narcissism for you, but for listeners who know who was on the air,
[03:19:40.940 --> 03:19:42.940]  if they just tuned in, StevePachinic.com.
[03:19:42.940 --> 03:19:45.940]  Again, I'm Alex Jones of InfoWars.com if you just tuned in.
[03:19:45.940 --> 03:19:48.940]  Everything you're saying I know to be true from deep research of it.
[03:19:48.940 --> 03:19:56.940]  The general public is working too hard to have all the details here, but here's my question for you.
[03:19:56.940 --> 03:20:05.940]  When I look at Pelosi, and I look at Hillary, and I look at the FBI and CIA people they've had follow me and at Bilderberg,
[03:20:05.940 --> 03:20:08.940]  they are like little kids talking into their suit jacket.
[03:20:08.940 --> 03:20:13.940]  You could see a little kid in a Batman outfit, they're imagining they're superheroes.
[03:20:13.940 --> 03:20:20.940]  I go to movies and see bureaucrats and cops watching Olympus is Fallen, total fantasy, watching Iron Man.
[03:20:20.940 --> 03:20:25.940]  The cops and people in the audience think it's real. It's like a nation of children.
[03:20:25.940 --> 03:20:28.940]  Where does this go with this Hollywood delusion?
[03:20:28.940 --> 03:20:36.940]  Like you said, FBI that can't repel off helicopters, and they're buying billions of rounds of ammo,
[03:20:36.940 --> 03:20:40.940]  armored vehicles, openly training for war with the American people.
[03:20:40.940 --> 03:20:48.940]  They can't even hold Baghdad, they can't control Afghanistan, but they really think they're going to start a civil war.
[03:20:48.940 --> 03:20:53.940]  I talk to good FBI people, federal marshals, I get the training manuals, we're the ones that break them.
[03:20:53.940 --> 03:20:57.940]  And it says all the Christians are terrorists, all the veterans are evil.
[03:20:57.940 --> 03:21:03.940]  I mean it's like cartoonish, like something Dr. Evil in a comedy would be talking like.
[03:21:03.940 --> 03:21:08.940]  You've got the military saying people can't pray, you know, to Jesus.
[03:21:08.940 --> 03:21:12.940]  I mean it's like we've become the Soviet Union, but they haven't taken over.
[03:21:12.940 --> 03:21:15.940]  They're just self-destructing, running around like lunatics.
[03:21:15.940 --> 03:21:20.940]  So as a psychiatrist, here's my rant, as a psychiatrist, have they gone insane like Nero?
[03:21:20.940 --> 03:21:25.940]  Because I know they're competent and they're evil, but I mean how crazy are they?
[03:21:25.940 --> 03:21:30.940]  It's not relevant to me, as a psychiatrist you have to remember two things.
[03:21:30.940 --> 03:21:33.940]  One, I did assassination.
[03:21:33.940 --> 03:21:37.940]  Two, I incarcerated those who were the criminally insane.
[03:21:37.940 --> 03:21:40.940]  So either way it doesn't matter to me whether they're evil or not.
[03:21:40.940 --> 03:21:47.940]  Once they've committed the act of terror or criminal, they either go to prison or they're executed.
[03:21:47.940 --> 03:21:49.940]  I really, it's quite simple.
[03:21:49.940 --> 03:21:56.940]  What you need is a leader who understands that, is not afraid, works within that constitution because they have been criminally indicted.
[03:21:56.940 --> 03:22:03.940]  As long as you have lawyers and legislators, you're going to have nothing but babble and psychobabble.
[03:22:03.940 --> 03:22:06.940]  The issue now as a psychiatrist is very simple.
[03:22:06.940 --> 03:22:11.940]  From my point of view, I've been used in five administrations to take out leaders,
[03:22:11.940 --> 03:22:17.940]  to take out systems without having to do as much as the military does because they're ineffective,
[03:22:17.940 --> 03:22:20.940]  without using the CIA, but you can take them out.
[03:22:20.940 --> 03:22:25.940]  If the people want somebody like me to lead them and I go forth, I mean they pick somebody,
[03:22:25.940 --> 03:22:28.940]  but they have to have somebody who's not beholden to anyone.
[03:22:28.940 --> 03:22:33.940]  They have to have somebody who understands the system, is willing to take it down very rapidly,
[03:22:33.940 --> 03:22:37.940]  and start to fire people the way Marshall did, the way Eisenhower did,
[03:22:37.940 --> 03:22:42.940]  and they have to pick people who understand that this is not an issue of whether they're sick or not sick.
[03:22:42.940 --> 03:22:44.940]  It's irrelevant to us now.
[03:22:44.940 --> 03:22:47.940]  We have a revolution. The revolution is clear.
[03:22:47.940 --> 03:22:50.940]  You have people who are totally incompetent, they're totally criminal.
[03:22:50.940 --> 03:22:56.940]  Either we do something about it, they get indicted, or they get executed.
[03:22:56.940 --> 03:22:58.940]  It's not very much to say more than that
[03:22:58.940 --> 03:23:01.940]  because otherwise we're going to see them commit another act
[03:23:01.940 --> 03:23:07.940]  and continuously commit what we call systemic acts until you said correctly they get caught.
[03:23:07.940 --> 03:23:10.940]  The only way to stop them is to literally stop them.
[03:23:10.940 --> 03:23:14.940]  That's what I believe, that's what I've done in five administrations,
[03:23:14.940 --> 03:23:18.940]  and that's why I don't belong to any one of these parties or any one of the affiliations.
[03:23:18.940 --> 03:23:23.940]  I fired, and I indicted, and I imprisoned, and I did what I had to do.
[03:23:23.940 --> 03:23:26.940]  That's what America has to do now. It's very simple.
[03:23:26.940 --> 03:23:30.940]  Sure, I want to understand their mindset on average so that I can understand,
[03:23:30.940 --> 03:23:31.940]  but I understand it's a collection of different groups.
[03:23:31.940 --> 03:23:34.940]  Their mindset, I can throw them criminally and sociopath.
[03:23:34.940 --> 03:23:37.940]  It doesn't really matter. They don't really care. They just continue on.
[03:23:37.940 --> 03:23:42.940]  I mean, Eastside started by breaking into cars and built up a security company, SI,
[03:23:42.940 --> 03:23:44.940]  and now he's an investigator.
[03:23:44.940 --> 03:23:46.940]  I mean, a criminal now investigates criminals.
[03:23:46.940 --> 03:23:50.940]  I mean, where they began and where they started is not relevant to me.
[03:23:50.940 --> 03:23:52.940]  It's the actions that they've committed.
[03:23:52.940 --> 03:23:55.940]  You and I know for since the beginning of time in Osama bin Laden,
[03:23:55.940 --> 03:23:58.940]  Bush Jr. has never been punished.
[03:23:58.940 --> 03:24:01.940]  Never been punished. His father goes out and explains it,
[03:24:01.940 --> 03:24:03.940]  and finally his mother says, no more Bush.
[03:24:03.940 --> 03:24:06.940]  Well, that's not enough. Bush has to be held accountable, Cheney,
[03:24:06.940 --> 03:24:09.940]  more than just the story, more than allowing them to get on TV.
[03:24:09.940 --> 03:24:13.940]  Either he goes on to prosecution, criminal, or...
[03:24:13.940 --> 03:24:17.940]  All right, we don't need to go there. Listen, here's my issue.
[03:24:17.940 --> 03:24:20.940]  I talk to active duty military people, as you do,
[03:24:20.940 --> 03:24:24.940]  and they tell me half the people, a couple of years ago it was like 35%,
[03:24:24.940 --> 03:24:27.940]  now half the people in the military are totally awake.
[03:24:27.940 --> 03:24:29.940]  They're listening to this show. I don't say that.
[03:24:29.940 --> 03:24:31.940]  It actually, I don't like that.
[03:24:31.940 --> 03:24:34.940]  It's kind of scary that nobody else has stood up
[03:24:34.940 --> 03:24:36.940]  and that we're one of the biggest oppositions to this.
[03:24:36.940 --> 03:24:39.940]  I just want common sense in the future for my children.
[03:24:39.940 --> 03:24:43.940]  But let's take Alex Jones and Steve Pacinik out of the equation.
[03:24:43.940 --> 03:24:48.940]  Okay, what do you expect things to do, places...
[03:24:48.940 --> 03:24:52.940]  What do you expect to unfold now is what I'm trying to get at,
[03:24:52.940 --> 03:24:55.940]  because I don't think they're probably going to do anything to Obama,
[03:24:55.940 --> 03:24:58.940]  even though he's been caught with his pants completely down.
[03:24:58.940 --> 03:25:01.940]  But then all that does is reaffirm the loss of confidence,
[03:25:01.940 --> 03:25:07.940]  and then I expect them to stage an even bigger grouping of Boston bombings
[03:25:07.940 --> 03:25:10.940]  to then try to put martial law in.
[03:25:10.940 --> 03:25:12.940]  They won't call it martial law,
[03:25:12.940 --> 03:25:16.940]  and I think that will even make them lose even more credibility.
[03:25:16.940 --> 03:25:18.940]  Well, let me be very blunt.
[03:25:18.940 --> 03:25:20.940]  I mean, you know, I've been warned of this repeatedly.
[03:25:20.940 --> 03:25:23.940]  There's not an accident that while Obama's been in the presidency,
[03:25:23.940 --> 03:25:27.940]  he's lauded and people have lauded the story of Abraham Lincoln,
[03:25:27.940 --> 03:25:29.940]  another tyrant from my point of view,
[03:25:29.940 --> 03:25:32.940]  who of course had gotten rid of habeas corpus
[03:25:32.940 --> 03:25:35.940]  and had indicted many of his own people
[03:25:35.940 --> 03:25:37.940]  and then had an aggression against the South
[03:25:37.940 --> 03:25:40.940]  for reasons that he claimed were the freedom of slavery,
[03:25:40.940 --> 03:25:41.940]  but that wasn't the case.
[03:25:41.940 --> 03:25:43.940]  It was to retain the republic.
[03:25:43.940 --> 03:25:48.940]  You either indict Obama, he goes to prison, or you execute him.
[03:25:48.940 --> 03:25:49.940]  There are not many alternatives.
[03:25:49.940 --> 03:25:53.940]  Now, either our military will stand up as a military or it won't.
[03:25:53.940 --> 03:25:56.940]  Most of the time I'm very unimpressed by our generals, our colonels,
[03:25:56.940 --> 03:25:58.940]  and those who've come to the top.
[03:25:58.940 --> 03:26:01.940]  Now I'm asking the majors, the captains, and the lieutenants,
[03:26:01.940 --> 03:26:03.940]  if you stay in the military,
[03:26:03.940 --> 03:26:06.940]  you're going to decide what you're going to have to do in the military.
[03:26:06.940 --> 03:26:07.940]  That means a junta,
[03:26:07.940 --> 03:26:10.940]  and that means you're going to have to do it in an effective way.
[03:26:10.940 --> 03:26:13.940]  I am asking for treason, treason in the time of period.
[03:26:13.940 --> 03:26:15.940]  Yeah, I want to be specific.
[03:26:15.940 --> 03:26:17.940]  Hold on, I didn't know you were going to go there.
[03:26:17.940 --> 03:26:18.940]  Isn't Obama just a puppet?
[03:26:18.940 --> 03:26:20.940]  I wish no harm upon him.
[03:26:20.940 --> 03:26:21.940]  He's not just a puppet.
[03:26:21.940 --> 03:26:23.940]  Puppets are as dangerous as anybody else.
[03:26:23.940 --> 03:26:27.940]  The puppet talks while the master, whether it's Brennan
[03:26:27.940 --> 03:26:30.940]  or the military industrial complex, is not relevant.
[03:26:30.940 --> 03:26:34.940]  If there's to be a military and there's to follow the command and control
[03:26:34.940 --> 03:26:37.940]  and their allegiance to the country, then they have to act accordingly.
[03:26:37.940 --> 03:26:38.940]  Dempsey did not.
[03:26:38.940 --> 03:26:39.940]  Mullen did not.
[03:26:39.940 --> 03:26:40.940]  Breyer did not.
[03:26:40.940 --> 03:26:41.940]  Jones did not.
[03:26:41.940 --> 03:26:44.940]  I mean, I can go through every Marine Corps commandment.
[03:26:44.940 --> 03:26:47.940]  Every one of these generals were brought into the military
[03:26:47.940 --> 03:26:49.940]  when they were born in the 70s.
[03:26:49.940 --> 03:26:52.940]  None of them really saw combat other than the ones that they had created.
[03:26:52.940 --> 03:26:56.940]  So you have a military that's dysfunctional, bloated, and ineffective.
[03:26:56.940 --> 03:26:59.940]  You have a CIA dysfunctional, bloated, and ineffective.
[03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:00.940]  Yeah, well, let me say this.
[03:27:00.940 --> 03:27:04.940]  The last thing I want is anything to happen to Obama outside of courts
[03:27:04.940 --> 03:27:06.940]  because that'll turn him into some type of hero.
[03:27:06.940 --> 03:27:09.940]  And what's incredible is you're who you say you are.
[03:27:09.940 --> 03:27:12.940]  Co-write books with Tom Clancy, ran black ops all over the world.
[03:27:12.940 --> 03:27:15.940]  You know, mainstream news says you, you know, assassinated world leaders.
[03:27:15.940 --> 03:27:18.940]  And you're on my show saying this.
[03:27:18.940 --> 03:27:22.940]  And, I mean, are you ready for the Secret Service to come after you?
[03:27:22.940 --> 03:27:25.940]  Secret Service has been after me for a long time.
[03:27:25.940 --> 03:27:28.940]  The Secret Service is the most dysfunctional unit I've ever seen.
[03:27:28.940 --> 03:27:32.940]  All they do is protect one man, and they protect the other presidents.
[03:27:32.940 --> 03:27:35.940]  They have no service whatsoever to the United States people.
[03:27:35.940 --> 03:27:37.940]  They do not protect them.
[03:27:37.940 --> 03:27:39.940]  They may believe that they have their money.
[03:27:39.940 --> 03:27:41.940]  No, I know, but you've talked about this stuff before on air.
[03:27:41.940 --> 03:27:44.940]  Why aren't you, why aren't they coming after you?
[03:27:44.940 --> 03:27:45.940]  Millions of dollars.
[03:27:45.940 --> 03:27:46.940]  What, what?
[03:27:46.940 --> 03:27:49.940]  Nothing needed to protect one man who's incompetent.
[03:27:49.940 --> 03:27:51.940]  And the Secret Service, quite frankly, is collusive.
[03:27:51.940 --> 03:27:54.940]  There's no reason for a major Secret Service.
[03:27:54.940 --> 03:27:56.940]  When you had Truman leaving, he left.
[03:27:56.940 --> 03:27:59.940]  When you had Eisenhower leaving, he didn't have an entourage.
[03:27:59.940 --> 03:28:05.940]  This was an absolute creation of their own dimension and their own narcissism.
[03:28:05.940 --> 03:28:06.940]  Sure.
[03:28:06.940 --> 03:28:09.940]  It's like turning the Chinese emperors into slaves with all the pomp and circumstance.
[03:28:09.940 --> 03:28:11.940]  More of the legal stuff.
[03:28:11.940 --> 03:28:15.940]  But, look, I'm trying to understand this because, because, I mean, I'm not saying, don't you
[03:28:15.940 --> 03:28:18.940]  want to clarify what you said or walk that back?
[03:28:18.940 --> 03:28:19.940]  Because, I mean-
[03:28:19.940 --> 03:28:20.940]  No, I don't want to clarify.
[03:28:20.940 --> 03:28:21.940]  It's very simple.
[03:28:21.940 --> 03:28:25.940]  If I am asked to do what I was asked to do in five administrations to take out Aldo
[03:28:25.940 --> 03:28:31.440]  Moro, to take out Noriega, to take out others, why would I not want also to take out the
[03:28:31.440 --> 03:28:33.940]  very people who've committed the crimes against our own government?
[03:28:33.940 --> 03:28:37.940]  That's not an act of treason when you have tyranny and they've been proven.
[03:28:37.940 --> 03:28:38.940]  No, I hear you.
[03:28:38.940 --> 03:28:39.940]  This is just completely over the top.
[03:28:39.940 --> 03:28:41.940]  If I go to jail, I'll go to jail.
[03:28:41.940 --> 03:28:44.940]  But if I'm the one to go to jail, then who else will join me?
[03:28:44.940 --> 03:28:46.940]  This is a cry for freedom.
[03:28:46.940 --> 03:28:48.940]  This is not some right wing nut.
[03:28:48.940 --> 03:28:50.940]  I said this about Osama bin Laden.
[03:28:50.940 --> 03:28:51.940]  I said it about 9-11.
[03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:53.940]  I said it about Joe Bush Jr.
[03:28:53.940 --> 03:28:54.940]  I said it about Cheney.
[03:28:54.940 --> 03:28:56.940]  How many times can I repeat it?
[03:28:56.940 --> 03:29:00.940]  You don't take a sociopath and you don't let him go.
[03:29:00.940 --> 03:29:04.940]  You just incarcerate him, incite him, or execute him.
[03:29:04.940 --> 03:29:07.940]  It's not complicated, but you don't listen to his words.
[03:29:07.940 --> 03:29:09.940]  And we have a bunch of sociopaths.
[03:29:09.940 --> 03:29:14.940]  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Bush Jr., you have Obama, you have Biden.
[03:29:14.940 --> 03:29:19.940]  These are all sociopaths who are rewarded by us and they're enforced by their own
[03:29:19.940 --> 03:29:23.940]  little group called the Secret Service and a whole group of other sociopaths who are
[03:29:23.940 --> 03:29:26.940]  criminals called the CIA who are total disasters.
[03:29:26.940 --> 03:29:31.940]  You have generals who have allegiance to their pension and not to their country.
[03:29:31.940 --> 03:29:33.940]  And they create wars that they can't even win.
[03:29:33.940 --> 03:29:37.940]  Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Somalia.
[03:29:37.940 --> 03:29:39.940]  This is an insane time to be alive and I just wish...
[03:29:39.940 --> 03:29:40.940]  It's not insane.
[03:29:40.940 --> 03:29:41.940]  It's really...
[03:29:41.940 --> 03:29:43.940]  No, it's what Thomas Jefferson said, my friend.
[03:29:43.940 --> 03:29:44.940]  No, no, I hear you.
[03:29:44.940 --> 03:29:45.940]  You got a lot of cojones.
[03:29:45.940 --> 03:29:47.940]  Every generation must fight for its own democracy.
[03:29:47.940 --> 03:29:48.940]  That's what we're doing.
[03:29:48.940 --> 03:29:49.940]  All right.
[03:29:49.940 --> 03:29:51.940]  I hope for a peaceful solution.
[03:29:51.940 --> 03:29:52.940]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.940 --> 03:29:53.940]  I want to peacefully fix everything.
[03:29:53.940 --> 03:30:22.940]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:23.940 --> 03:30:52.940]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:30:52.940 --> 03:30:53.940]  Thank you.
[03:30:53.940 --> 03:30:54.940]  Thank you.
[03:30:54.940 --> 03:31:23.940]  Thank you.
[03:31:23.940 --> 03:31:41.940]  Thank you.
[03:31:41.940 --> 03:32:01.940]  Thank you.
[03:32:01.940 --> 03:32:25.940]  Thank you.
[03:32:25.940 --> 03:32:45.940]  Thank you.
[03:32:45.940 --> 03:33:05.940]  Thank you.
[03:33:05.940 --> 03:33:20.940]  Thank you.
[03:33:20.940 --> 03:33:22.940]  Well, I have been completely blindsided today.
[03:33:22.940 --> 03:33:25.940]  Dr. Steve Picinich has produced major Hollywood movies.
[03:33:25.940 --> 03:33:28.940]  He's co-written books with Tom Clancy, written his own bestsellers.
[03:33:28.940 --> 03:33:33.940]  He was the main psychiatrist negotiator for the Camp David Accords.
[03:33:33.940 --> 03:33:37.940]  He has been involved in black ops all over the world, one of the founders of Delta Force,
[03:33:37.940 --> 03:33:41.940]  and he's on my show, you know, talking about all this.
[03:33:41.940 --> 03:33:48.940]  And look, it's not that I'm afraid of repercussions because I'm a guy that's always calling for
[03:33:48.940 --> 03:33:56.940]  nonviolence because I believe that ideas and exposing their lies will make them lose credibility.
[03:33:56.940 --> 03:33:57.940]  We're going to go back to Dr. Picinich.
[03:33:57.940 --> 03:34:01.940]  Let me have the last word on this, but I'll tell you where I stand.
[03:34:01.940 --> 03:34:03.940]  The American people have let corruption take over.
[03:34:03.940 --> 03:34:05.940]  We have been too passive.
[03:34:05.940 --> 03:34:07.940]  We have worshiped bureaucracy.
[03:34:07.940 --> 03:34:10.940]  We have worshiped the red carpets of all these people.
[03:34:10.940 --> 03:34:15.940]  The top generals, it's been widely reported, are on beautiful jets with secretaries sex
[03:34:15.940 --> 03:34:22.940]  servicing them with, you know, walnut and maple wood paneling and champagne.
[03:34:22.940 --> 03:34:28.940]  And then the troops are on C-130s with fleas and flies and ticks defecating in buckets
[03:34:28.940 --> 03:34:31.940]  with stuff running down the hallways.
[03:34:31.940 --> 03:34:35.940]  And I've talked to family that's in the military, and they're still gung-ho, but they're like,
[03:34:35.940 --> 03:34:37.940]  oh, yeah, everything's collapsing, but we can do it.
[03:34:37.940 --> 03:34:39.940]  Five, six, seven tours.
[03:34:39.940 --> 03:34:41.940]  You never made somebody serve over one tour.
[03:34:41.940 --> 03:34:43.940]  I mean, just why are they committing suicide?
[03:34:43.940 --> 03:34:47.940]  You're using them like, you know, 500,000 miles on a pair of tires that are supposed
[03:34:47.940 --> 03:34:48.940]  to go 100,000.
[03:34:48.940 --> 03:34:50.940]  They know what they're doing.
[03:34:50.940 --> 03:34:53.940]  There is a crazy disconnect going on.
[03:34:53.940 --> 03:34:56.940]  And the globalists want a civil war in this country.
[03:34:56.940 --> 03:34:59.940]  They want to get one started because they can't win the Velvet Revolution.
[03:34:59.940 --> 03:35:04.940]  You know, look, I know that Adam Kokesh isn't a globalist operative, but he wants armed
[03:35:04.940 --> 03:35:05.940]  marches on D.C.
[03:35:05.940 --> 03:35:08.940]  He has a right to do it, to educate about the Second Amendment.
[03:35:08.940 --> 03:35:10.940]  The Supreme Court's ruled they can do it.
[03:35:10.940 --> 03:35:13.940]  But the police chief says they can't, D.C.
[03:35:13.940 --> 03:35:14.940]  Heller.
[03:35:14.940 --> 03:35:16.940]  I understand he has a right.
[03:35:16.940 --> 03:35:17.940]  I don't think he's a bad guy.
[03:35:17.940 --> 03:35:18.940]  I admire his courage.
[03:35:18.940 --> 03:35:20.940]  But my gut says it's bad.
[03:35:20.940 --> 03:35:24.940]  And as for Pacinek, Dr. Steve Pacinek here with us, I get him on about Benghazi because
[03:35:24.940 --> 03:35:29.940]  he accurately said what happened seven months ago, a few weeks after it happened.
[03:35:29.940 --> 03:35:36.940]  And then he goes off into this whole other area that, you know, Doc, I got to say something.
[03:35:36.940 --> 03:35:40.940]  You know, I mean, I know you've been a member of the Council of Foreign Relations, the whole
[03:35:40.940 --> 03:35:44.940]  nine yards, and I would have to think that you believe you're protected by something
[03:35:44.940 --> 03:35:46.940]  to be able to talk like that on air.
[03:35:46.940 --> 03:35:50.940]  But even if I believe what you're saying, you know, obviously I wouldn't say it, but
[03:35:50.940 --> 03:35:52.940]  I don't believe what you're saying.
[03:35:52.940 --> 03:35:58.940]  I do not believe I do not believe a military coup in this country is the way to go, because
[03:35:58.940 --> 03:36:01.940]  because the bureaucracy is still all there.
[03:36:01.940 --> 03:36:04.940]  I mean, I mean, what are you saying on the airwaves here?
[03:36:04.940 --> 03:36:12.940]  What I'm saying is basically you already had a military coup when every one of the congressmen
[03:36:12.940 --> 03:36:17.940]  and senators, he just saw Portman, Senator Portman, the so great spokesman for Mitt Romney
[03:36:17.940 --> 03:36:23.940]  and others who's a Republican fiscal say, oh, no, I need M1 Abrams tanks, when in fact
[03:36:23.940 --> 03:36:25.940]  the Army said we don't need it.
[03:36:25.940 --> 03:36:26.940]  And he said, no, he lied.
[03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:28.940]  We need it for national security.
[03:36:28.940 --> 03:36:29.940]  And the Army said, no.
[03:36:29.940 --> 03:36:36.940]  What's happening is every legislator, every senator has been undertaken, costaged by the
[03:36:36.940 --> 03:36:43.940]  military industrial complex that means the tank, the factories.
[03:36:43.940 --> 03:36:49.940]  What has happened is they are already under a military industrial coup already.
[03:36:49.940 --> 03:36:52.940]  What I'm saying is our military is dysfunctional.
[03:36:52.940 --> 03:36:54.940]  They are no longer functional.
[03:36:54.940 --> 03:36:59.940]  Our generals have no longer been in an area of combat for national security.
[03:36:59.940 --> 03:37:01.940]  They've created the wars they've created.
[03:37:01.940 --> 03:37:06.940]  It's time for them to be judged, indicted and executed.
[03:37:06.940 --> 03:37:07.940]  OK, no more of that.
[03:37:07.940 --> 03:37:08.940]  Listen, listen.
[03:37:08.940 --> 03:37:09.940]  Now, I ran.
[03:37:09.940 --> 03:37:10.940]  Listen, wait a minute.
[03:37:10.940 --> 03:37:12.940]  It's not something that I'm just out of right field.
[03:37:12.940 --> 03:37:14.940]  I ran the criminally insane ward.
[03:37:14.940 --> 03:37:19.940]  I had the same type of generals there who were indicted for mass murders.
[03:37:19.940 --> 03:37:24.940]  I had the same types of legislators who were indicted for all kinds of criminal activities.
[03:37:24.940 --> 03:37:25.940]  This is not unique.
[03:37:25.940 --> 03:37:32.940]  A physician has two obligations, to heal and to execute if necessary if a patient is moribund
[03:37:32.940 --> 03:37:34.940]  or you have cancer.
[03:37:34.940 --> 03:37:36.940]  What we have now is the cancer in the system.
[03:37:36.940 --> 03:37:41.940]  The cancer in the system is growing to such an extent that words are not doing anything.
[03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:46.940]  So you have somebody like the DCM who comes out and blows the whistle.
[03:37:46.940 --> 03:37:47.940]  And I admire him.
[03:37:47.940 --> 03:37:50.940]  You have an original security officer who admires them.
[03:37:50.940 --> 03:37:54.940]  Then I have somebody like Issei saying, oh, that's very nice.
[03:37:54.940 --> 03:37:57.940]  And a lot of legislators, you just have to elaborate.
[03:37:57.940 --> 03:38:02.940]  Unless you indict your president and then I see you indict him and have an investigation.
[03:38:02.940 --> 03:38:05.940]  It doesn't have to be with wars and weapons.
[03:38:05.940 --> 03:38:06.940]  No, no, no, I get it.
[03:38:06.940 --> 03:38:10.940]  We need to have we need to have a special prosecutor.
[03:38:10.940 --> 03:38:12.940]  A Clinton for a fellatio.
[03:38:12.940 --> 03:38:19.940]  You certainly can indict Obama for military miscreant behavior, for inappropriate in command
[03:38:19.940 --> 03:38:23.940]  and control, for criminal activities against the United States.
[03:38:23.940 --> 03:38:25.940]  And you can do that for Biden.
[03:38:25.940 --> 03:38:27.940]  You can do that for the White House.
[03:38:27.940 --> 03:38:28.940]  You can do that for everyone.
[03:38:28.940 --> 03:38:29.940]  But how do you.
[03:38:29.940 --> 03:38:30.940]  Sure, sure, sure.
[03:38:30.940 --> 03:38:32.940]  Let me stop you for a minute.
[03:38:32.940 --> 03:38:33.940]  There you go.
[03:38:33.940 --> 03:38:34.940]  I mean, we do what we did with Nixon.
[03:38:34.940 --> 03:38:35.940]  That's the way this needs to go.
[03:38:35.940 --> 03:38:40.940]  My question to you is they are creating a secret army, the billions of bullets, the
[03:38:40.940 --> 03:38:43.940]  armored vehicles, the training for war with us.
[03:38:43.940 --> 03:38:47.940]  So I'm trying to stop all this before it goes to that.
[03:38:47.940 --> 03:38:52.940]  Well, it's not going to be that because, number one, this army didn't even function well in
[03:38:52.940 --> 03:38:56.940]  Iraq and the wars they created, they didn't function well in Afghanistan.
[03:38:56.940 --> 03:38:58.940]  What is happening now?
[03:38:58.940 --> 03:39:01.940]  The real burden goes to those below the generals.
[03:39:01.940 --> 03:39:06.940]  That's why you address the captains and the lieutenants who say, do you want to remain
[03:39:06.940 --> 03:39:11.940]  in the army, clean out your army, clean out your navy, clean out your air force.
[03:39:11.940 --> 03:39:17.940]  The veterans, one million, 40 percent who have PTSD and 40 percent who have suicide
[03:39:17.940 --> 03:39:20.940]  rates, if you want to do something with it, then you're going to have to deal with the
[03:39:20.940 --> 03:39:21.940]  VA.
[03:39:21.940 --> 03:39:22.940]  That's ineffectual.
[03:39:22.940 --> 03:39:27.940]  General Shinseki, who I've asked for the retirement repeatedly and for the fact that you
[03:39:27.940 --> 03:39:28.940]  will not get the treatment.
[03:39:28.940 --> 03:39:31.940]  You have one million veterans who have to do something.
[03:39:31.940 --> 03:39:37.940]  In 1927, a million veterans walked in Washington and it was General McArthur who had to stop
[03:39:37.940 --> 03:39:38.940]  it.
[03:39:38.940 --> 03:39:43.940]  But unless you go to the streets, unless you go to the internet, unless anonymous people
[03:39:43.940 --> 03:39:50.940]  do what they have to do, this system will not break down just by little spurts of discussion
[03:39:50.940 --> 03:39:53.940]  and a little spurt of questioning.
[03:39:53.940 --> 03:39:55.940]  It has to be exactly what I do.
[03:39:55.940 --> 03:40:01.940]  A physician examines, cures, or decides he terminates.
[03:40:01.940 --> 03:40:02.940]  That's exactly what we do.
[03:40:02.940 --> 03:40:04.940]  We apportion health care.
[03:40:04.940 --> 03:40:09.940]  Whether it sounds obscene or a mangler, that's not even relevant.
[03:40:09.940 --> 03:40:11.940]  We do that all the time.
[03:40:11.940 --> 03:40:13.940]  Ask any physician in the emergency room.
[03:40:13.940 --> 03:40:15.940]  He will evaluate what's out there.
[03:40:15.940 --> 03:40:17.940]  The people he can treat, he can treat.
[03:40:17.940 --> 03:40:21.940]  Those he can't will have to wait and those who have committed the crimes or whatever
[03:40:21.940 --> 03:40:23.940]  will rarely get treated.
[03:40:23.940 --> 03:40:28.940]  Now we've come into a system that is so sick that unless you prosecute them, indict
[03:40:28.940 --> 03:40:33.940]  them, with an investigator that's totally independent of the system, that doesn't
[03:40:33.940 --> 03:40:38.940]  get a bonus, doesn't get paid, is not part of the military like Dempsey, is not part
[03:40:38.940 --> 03:40:44.940]  Pickering who belongs to Boeing and to various other organizations of the Council of Foreign
[03:40:44.940 --> 03:40:49.940]  Relations, or Pat Kennedy who's paid by the State Department, or Eric Boswell who's
[03:40:49.940 --> 03:40:53.940]  being paid by the State Department, or Dempsey who has his pension in double dip.
[03:40:53.940 --> 03:40:55.940]  Do you understand what I'm getting at?
[03:40:55.940 --> 03:41:00.940]  Unless you get to the core of the money and take away their money and then strip them
[03:41:00.940 --> 03:41:03.940]  down into an investigative procedure, nothing will happen.
[03:41:03.940 --> 03:41:08.940]  If nothing then happens, then the American public deserves what it's called for.
[03:41:08.940 --> 03:41:09.940]  What I say is revolution.
[03:41:09.940 --> 03:41:15.940]  Revolution, I said it 11 years ago when 9-11 happened, revolution in any way you want,
[03:41:15.940 --> 03:41:20.940]  the form that you take, but Thomas Jefferson said it, Adams said it, George Washington
[03:41:20.940 --> 03:41:21.940]  said it.
[03:41:21.940 --> 03:41:26.940]  He warned us repeatedly of people like Obama, Clinton, Bush Jr.
[03:41:26.940 --> 03:41:29.940]  They are constant sociopaths who will self-aggrandize.
[03:41:29.940 --> 03:41:33.940]  Whatever they are as a psychiatrist is not relevant to me.
[03:41:33.940 --> 03:41:39.940]  What they do and damage to our veterans, to our people who have no job, to the wars and
[03:41:39.940 --> 03:41:47.940]  killing of 380,000 innocent Iraqi, Afghani, Pakistanis, and create civil wars in Iraq
[03:41:47.940 --> 03:41:53.940]  and shift it to the Shiite with Iran and then create another war where they go gung ho in
[03:41:53.940 --> 03:41:54.940]  the CIA.
[03:41:54.940 --> 03:41:55.940]  That is criminal activity.
[03:41:55.940 --> 03:41:57.940]  You have to pay for that.
[03:41:57.940 --> 03:41:59.940]  It really is criminal activity.
[03:41:59.940 --> 03:42:01.940]  Well, the reason I bring up this- Sure.
[03:42:01.940 --> 03:42:02.940]  Sure.
[03:42:02.940 --> 03:42:05.940]  The reason I bring up the psychology- Sure.
[03:42:05.940 --> 03:42:07.940]  Doc, can you hear me?
[03:42:07.940 --> 03:42:11.940]  I mean, my point is they are going crazy.
[03:42:11.940 --> 03:42:15.940]  I mean, they're publicly funding Al-Qaeda while saying give our rights up because of
[03:42:15.940 --> 03:42:16.940]  Al-Qaeda.
[03:42:16.940 --> 03:42:21.940]  What will happen if the American people don't have a restoration of the republic and try
[03:42:21.940 --> 03:42:22.940]  to turn things around?
[03:42:22.940 --> 03:42:23.940]  What will happen?
[03:42:23.940 --> 03:42:26.940]  They will just steal everything until everything collapses.
[03:42:26.940 --> 03:42:28.940]  They're devaluing the dollar.
[03:42:28.940 --> 03:42:29.940]  They are insane.
[03:42:29.940 --> 03:42:30.940]  I understand you're desperate.
[03:42:30.940 --> 03:42:34.940]  I understand you're putting yourself out on a limb saying this.
[03:42:34.940 --> 03:42:40.940]  I know you're a real guy who's done a lot of things and basically has a lot of will.
[03:42:40.940 --> 03:42:45.940]  My only issue is I think we're winning in the info war and I think if things just go
[03:42:45.940 --> 03:42:49.940]  a little bit further down the line without having a shooting war, we're going to win
[03:42:49.940 --> 03:42:50.940]  this thing.
[03:42:50.940 --> 03:42:52.940]  Now, if a shooting war starts- I understand what you're saying.
[03:42:52.940 --> 03:42:54.940]  I'm not saying necessarily a shooting war.
[03:42:54.940 --> 03:42:56.940]  I'm just saying a war of action.
[03:42:56.940 --> 03:42:58.940]  A war of action doesn't have to be a shooting war.
[03:42:58.940 --> 03:43:02.940]  For example, Murdoch and Fox News did a great job.
[03:43:02.940 --> 03:43:03.940]  Benghazi.
[03:43:03.940 --> 03:43:04.940]  The New York Times.
[03:43:04.940 --> 03:43:07.940]  Jill Abramson did a very great job on Sandy Hook.
[03:43:07.940 --> 03:43:10.940]  Huffington Post did a great job on revealing very others.
[03:43:10.940 --> 03:43:12.940]  You've done a phenomenal job.
[03:43:12.940 --> 03:43:14.940]  It's got to keep going on.
[03:43:14.940 --> 03:43:20.940]  The issue here is that you don't have a body of legislative individuals who can be trusted.
[03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:22.940]  Feinstein cannot be trusted.
[03:43:22.940 --> 03:43:23.940]  Pelosi cannot be trusted.
[03:43:23.940 --> 03:43:24.940]  Max Baucus.
[03:43:24.940 --> 03:43:28.940]  You can't trust the people who are overseeing the criminals.
[03:43:28.940 --> 03:43:29.940]  Well, they're weird.
[03:43:29.940 --> 03:43:30.940]  They're weird people.
[03:43:30.940 --> 03:43:36.940]  That has to have immediate action, whether you incarcerate them or you assign a special
[03:43:36.940 --> 03:43:39.940]  prosecutor designated by the people or the governors.
[03:43:39.940 --> 03:43:40.940]  That's fine by me.
[03:43:40.940 --> 03:43:46.940]  But the question is, the system has to change much more rapidly than our going on the radio
[03:43:46.940 --> 03:43:48.940]  for 11 years and warning people.
[03:43:48.940 --> 03:43:50.940]  This has been going on repeatedly.
[03:43:50.940 --> 03:43:52.940]  It's clearly getting worse.
[03:43:52.940 --> 03:43:53.940]  All right.
[03:43:53.940 --> 03:43:56.940]  I'm not worried about what happens to me.
[03:43:56.940 --> 03:43:58.940]  I'm not desperate at all.
[03:43:58.940 --> 03:44:03.940]  I'm as calm and cool collected as I was the day when I said to you 9-11 was a standout.
[03:44:03.940 --> 03:44:08.940]  It was Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Burroughs, Steve Hadley, Sandy Berger on rendition.
[03:44:08.940 --> 03:44:09.940]  I know them all.
[03:44:09.940 --> 03:44:11.940]  This is not something that I was totally surprised.
[03:44:11.940 --> 03:44:14.940]  This was not something, but nothing was done.
[03:44:14.940 --> 03:44:16.940]  Then they all got frightened that I might take them out.
[03:44:16.940 --> 03:44:18.940]  No, I haven't taken them out.
[03:44:18.940 --> 03:44:19.940]  Can I take them out?
[03:44:19.940 --> 03:44:20.940]  Yes.
[03:44:20.940 --> 03:44:23.940]  Does the intelligence community know I can take them out?
[03:44:23.940 --> 03:44:24.940]  Yes.
[03:44:24.940 --> 03:44:25.940]  Are they afraid of me?
[03:44:25.940 --> 03:44:26.940]  Yes.
[03:44:26.940 --> 03:44:27.940]  Am I afraid of them?
[03:44:27.940 --> 03:44:28.940]  No.
[03:44:28.940 --> 03:44:29.940]  Is this a stand down?
[03:44:29.940 --> 03:44:30.940]  Yes.
[03:44:30.940 --> 03:44:32.940]  Am I the only American who can say this?
[03:44:32.940 --> 03:44:33.940]  No.
[03:44:33.940 --> 03:44:36.940]  But every American is afraid to say, this is what I am.
[03:44:36.940 --> 03:44:39.940]  I'm an American citizen and I'm sick of what's going on.
[03:44:39.940 --> 03:44:41.940]  That's all they have to say.
[03:44:41.940 --> 03:44:43.940]  The governors are powerful.
[03:44:43.940 --> 03:44:45.940]  You've got southern governors like Rick Perry.
[03:44:45.940 --> 03:44:47.940]  You've got Scott Perry.
[03:44:47.940 --> 03:44:48.940]  You've got in Florida.
[03:44:48.940 --> 03:44:50.940]  You've got Rick Scott in Florida.
[03:44:50.940 --> 03:44:52.940]  You've got South Carolina.
[03:44:52.940 --> 03:44:53.940]  You've got North Carolina.
[03:44:53.940 --> 03:44:54.940]  You've got Georgia.
[03:44:54.940 --> 03:45:00.940]  The power has shifted geopolitically from the north, and I say the think tanks and the
[03:45:00.940 --> 03:45:02.940]  counts on Fox, they're all dead.
[03:45:02.940 --> 03:45:04.940]  They're the dead.
[03:45:04.940 --> 03:45:10.940]  They're the basically demented individuals who have nothing else to say and they still
[03:45:10.940 --> 03:45:11.940]  want to stay alive.
[03:45:11.940 --> 03:45:14.940]  They're being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[03:45:14.940 --> 03:45:18.940]  You have Strove Taub running the Brookings Institute, who is the former deputy secretary
[03:45:18.940 --> 03:45:23.940]  of state and the roommate of Clinton, and he's running an institute totally useless.
[03:45:23.940 --> 03:45:25.940]  Well, no, they hate America.
[03:45:25.940 --> 03:45:26.940]  They hate free market.
[03:45:26.940 --> 03:45:27.940]  He's a committed communist.
[03:45:27.940 --> 03:45:29.940]  By the US government.
[03:45:29.940 --> 03:45:32.940]  You've got L3 communications, totally useless.
[03:45:32.940 --> 03:45:33.940]  You've got Boeing.
[03:45:33.940 --> 03:45:40.940]  You've got Northrop Grumman, all of whom immediately went from a dysfunctional system into cybersecurity
[03:45:40.940 --> 03:45:46.940]  and got paid for nonsensical work and pieces of work that I look at and I say are not even
[03:45:46.940 --> 03:45:47.940]  worthy.
[03:45:47.940 --> 03:45:51.940]  So unless the people stand forth and they want to do it through the legal process, let's
[03:45:51.940 --> 03:45:53.940]  let you know.
[03:45:53.940 --> 03:45:54.940]  I hear you.
[03:45:54.940 --> 03:45:55.940]  It's a disaster.
[03:45:55.940 --> 03:45:56.940]  We're out of time.
[03:45:56.940 --> 03:45:57.940]  We're out of time.
[03:45:57.940 --> 03:46:02.940]  Listen, I want to thank you for coming on and we'll we'll hopefully try to talk to you
[03:46:02.940 --> 03:46:06.940]  again soon and see what happens with these statements you've made on air.
[03:46:06.940 --> 03:46:10.140]  Alice, it'll blow out more.
[03:46:10.140 --> 03:46:11.940]  So just expect everything to get even crazier.
[03:46:11.940 --> 03:46:12.940]  All right, Dr. Pachinik.
[03:46:12.940 --> 03:46:13.940]  Thank you very much.
[03:46:13.940 --> 03:46:15.140]  I've got some closing comments on this.
[03:46:15.140 --> 03:46:17.340]  I've been on air three hours and forty six minutes.
[03:46:17.340 --> 03:46:21.220]  I got a little bit tired towards the end of the show and I get hit by something like this.
[03:46:21.220 --> 03:46:22.660]  But I'm ready for a nap.
[03:46:22.660 --> 03:46:25.100]  I mean, I wanted to talk about Benghazi.
[03:46:25.100 --> 03:46:30.060]  I want to bring these people down with their crimes and Pachinik, it's just my life is
[03:46:30.060 --> 03:46:31.060]  too bizarre.
[03:46:31.060 --> 03:46:32.900]  I mean, I'm just going to be honest with you right now.
[03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:37.500]  This is way over my head, but it's way over everybody else's head.
[03:46:37.500 --> 03:46:38.940]  We're all just humans.
[03:46:38.940 --> 03:46:41.540]  And this is crazy land.
[03:46:41.540 --> 03:46:44.300]  The globalists are crazy.
[03:46:44.300 --> 03:46:46.740]  And the only way to respond to crazy is crazy.
[03:46:46.740 --> 03:46:51.580]  I mean, I get that, but I just can't handle it anymore.
[03:46:51.580 --> 03:46:52.580]  By the way, I'm not on air tomorrow.
[03:46:52.580 --> 03:46:53.940]  I'll be calling in on the show.
[03:46:53.940 --> 03:46:56.340]  I'm going to spend some time with family.
[03:46:56.340 --> 03:46:59.860]  We've got Holland van den Neuenhof coming in, he always does a great job.
[03:46:59.860 --> 03:47:03.140]  And we're going to have Ja'Carri Jackson and David Knight in here with them.
[03:47:03.140 --> 03:47:04.540]  And I'll be calling in at noon on the show.
[03:47:04.540 --> 03:47:08.740]  I'm just spending some time with my parents for Mother's Day and my kids.
[03:47:08.740 --> 03:47:12.540]  Only way I can spend time with my kids because I end up working 18 hours a day is to take
[03:47:12.540 --> 03:47:13.540]  off a day here and there.
[03:47:13.540 --> 03:47:18.540]  We'll be back Sunday live, 4 to 6 o'clock, there's Infowars nightly news tonight.

[03:47:23.220 --> 03:47:28.580]  It's just what they put out to create the illusion that they haven't been arming them
[03:47:28.580 --> 03:47:29.580]  all along.
[03:47:29.580 --> 03:47:32.340]  That's just designed to get to a public that doesn't pay attention.
[03:47:32.340 --> 03:47:35.060]  Will you guys punch up Infowars.com for me?
[03:47:35.060 --> 03:47:36.060]  Thanks.
[03:47:36.060 --> 03:47:40.060]  Breaking 3D printable gun ordered shut down by the government.
[03:47:40.060 --> 03:47:42.220]  That is big breaking news.

[03:47:46.980 --> 03:47:52.940]  Clinton Rice presented awards for public service on the same day as Benghazi hearing.
[03:47:52.940 --> 03:47:55.500]  There's no end to these nuts when they love awards.
[03:47:55.500 --> 03:48:00.580]  It's like a total, what do you call it, narcissism world.
[03:48:00.580 --> 03:48:02.860]  Boston top cop warns against police state.

[03:48:22.460 --> 03:48:26.740]  They're going across the border and they got field hospitals set up, taking care of Al
[03:48:26.740 --> 03:48:27.740]  Qaeda.
[03:48:27.740 --> 03:48:30.660]  I mean, we have entered the ninth dimension here.
[03:48:30.660 --> 03:48:31.740]  It just goes on and on.
[03:48:31.740 --> 03:48:38.940]  That's just some of the news up at Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.

[03:48:45.860 --> 03:48:48.660]  They're scared of Cruz being a libertarian Ron Paul type.
[03:48:48.660 --> 03:48:54.940]  So they act like they're not scared and go, better not be like that or we'll beat you.
[03:48:54.940 --> 03:48:59.220]  Dems long to turn Lone Star State blue.

[03:49:02.140 --> 03:49:04.260]  Al Pacinek was saying all that stuff.
[03:49:04.260 --> 03:49:08.700]  I mean, this is just complete bizarro world.
[03:49:08.700 --> 03:49:10.500]  Good second trip to Texas in two weeks.

[03:49:32.180 --> 03:49:33.540]  So that's part of that.
[03:49:33.540 --> 03:49:34.740]  All hat, no cattle.
[03:49:34.740 --> 03:49:35.740]  There's Obama.
[03:49:35.740 --> 03:49:36.740]  Absolutely.
[03:49:36.740 --> 03:49:38.180]  That's a good saying.
[03:49:38.180 --> 03:49:39.180]  Big sis.
[03:49:39.180 --> 03:49:45.460]  Bill gives big sis virtually unlimited, sole, unreviewable.
[03:49:45.460 --> 03:49:50.420]  That's what they're doing with Obamacare, all this transfer of power, discretion to

[03:50:07.540 --> 03:50:08.540]  fire.
[03:50:08.540 --> 03:50:09.540]  Oh, really?
[03:50:09.540 --> 03:50:10.540]  Why do you think?
[03:50:10.540 --> 03:50:11.540]  Said they didn't know him.
[03:50:11.540 --> 03:50:12.540]  Of course they knew him.
[03:50:12.540 --> 03:50:13.820]  And it just goes on and on.
