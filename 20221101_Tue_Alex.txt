[00:00.000 --> 00:11.660]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.660 --> 00:18.460]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.460 --> 00:34.460]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34.460 --> 00:41.260]  Life? What knife? Are you suggesting this is a knife I have in my hand? Have you gone
[00:41.260 --> 00:46.260]  mad, my sane husband? There was a knife, but I lost it.
[00:46.260 --> 00:51.580]  Remember what the FBI did last week? They said crime has gone down in the last year
[00:51.580 --> 00:57.060]  and a half by 2%. Of course, crime on average is about 50% around the country. Some areas
[00:57.060 --> 01:01.260]  is up fourfold, some of the blue cities. Everybody knows that. There's a crime wave.
[01:01.260 --> 01:09.380]  In fact, in July, transit crime was up nearly 57% compared to July of last year.
[01:09.380 --> 01:17.740]  The FBI just doesn't count crime in America's largest 50-plus cities. So they don't process
[01:17.740 --> 01:29.100]  the crime numbers from Chicago, or LA, or New York, or Miami, or Houston, or Dallas,
[01:29.100 --> 01:36.340]  or Detroit, or San Antonio, or Oakland, or Seattle, or Portland. They just say right
[01:36.340 --> 01:42.100]  there, oh, big headline, crime's actually down since Biden got in. Then you go read
[01:42.100 --> 01:48.060]  the fine print, they go, we no longer process statistics out of the largest cities, which
[01:48.060 --> 01:52.300]  is where the majority of people live, and where the majority of the crime's happening.
[01:52.300 --> 01:57.060]  That's as big a gaslighting as Daryl Brooks saying, I'm not Daryl Brooks.
[01:57.060 --> 02:02.340]  Right, Mr. Brooks, you are well aware that the reasons documents are being-
[02:02.340 --> 02:06.620]  Billions in taxpayer money in America alone, exact same program was run in Europe, and
[02:06.620 --> 02:11.220]  the UK and Australia and Canada and New Zealand, all the same coordinated U.N. control, having
[02:11.220 --> 02:16.460]  big tech censor, anybody that government big pharma said censor, from talk show host
[02:16.460 --> 02:20.580]  to medical doctors to mothers and fathers that lost their children or loved ones from
[02:20.580 --> 02:22.260]  the shots, must be silenced.
[02:22.260 --> 02:30.140]  This is a time for science and solidarity. Yet the global mis-infodemic is spreading.
[02:30.140 --> 02:35.460]  Harmful health advice and snake oil solutions are proliferating. False woods are filling
[02:35.460 --> 02:42.100]  the airwaves. Wild conspiracy theories are infecting the internet. HATRED is going viral,
[02:42.100 --> 02:50.060]  stigmatizing and vilifying people and groups. The world must unite against this disease too.
[02:50.060 --> 02:51.620]  And the vaccine is trust.
[02:51.620 --> 02:57.740]  Now remember, last year, a college athlete in great health had microcarditis and a heart
[02:57.740 --> 03:00.340]  attack and had to have heart ablation. It almost died.
[03:00.340 --> 03:08.020]  I am in the hospital right now with heart complications from the COVID-19 vaccine. And I want to inform
[03:08.020 --> 03:12.540]  as many people as I can about the risks from taking the vaccine that I wish someone would
[03:12.540 --> 03:14.060]  have told me.
[03:14.060 --> 03:18.220]  And the doctor at the hospital said the shot caused it. The Pfizer shot caused it. And
[03:18.220 --> 03:21.580]  they censored him and took him off Instagram when his video had 5 million views. And then
[03:21.580 --> 03:26.500]  the U.N. was quoted in Yahoo News. And they said, well, we're the U.N., we're an advisory
[03:26.500 --> 03:30.180]  panel and we told them to take his channel down. Even though what the young man said
[03:30.180 --> 03:34.060]  is true and his doctor told the truth, so the U.N. is in control.
[03:34.060 --> 03:40.020]  Biden's health and human services of CDC paid screenwriters and comedians to mock unvaccinated
[03:40.020 --> 03:43.780]  and to call for violence against them. Remember all that? How we're murderers, how we're
[03:43.780 --> 03:49.580]  killers, how we should be denied medical care, how we should be put in jail, how we should
[03:49.580 --> 03:54.220]  be put in camps. This was their big authoritarian rollout, their big attempt to take over and
[03:54.220 --> 03:58.540]  people woke up and backed them off. Now they hope you just forget and go away and don't
[03:58.540 --> 04:01.020]  call for their prosecution and don't sue them.
[04:01.020 --> 04:06.620]  For most Americans, one COVID shot each year will be all they need. And if you get it,
[04:06.620 --> 04:11.980]  you're protected. And if you don't, you're putting yourself and other people on necessary
[04:11.980 --> 04:18.860]  risk. Get the shot. Five, ten, twenty dollars off your drugstore grocery purchase or grocery
[04:18.860 --> 04:22.060]  purchase next time at the same time you get the shot.
[04:22.060 --> 04:25.860]  You're not going away. None of us are going away. And you won't silence us with intimidation.
[04:25.860 --> 04:31.340]  You'll only intensify our efforts. You murdering criminals that have tried to gag us and silence
[04:31.340 --> 04:38.380]  us while we expose what you and the Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, U.N. run depopulation operation
[04:38.380 --> 04:39.580]  have launched against us.
[04:39.580 --> 04:42.580]  But you don't have a choice. People act like you have a choice.
[04:42.580 --> 04:47.340]  I am honored to be public enemy number one. I am honored to globalist hate my guts. I
[04:47.340 --> 04:52.300]  am honored to be going at them 110 percent because we're defending the lives of ourselves
[04:52.300 --> 05:01.260]  and our families and every human on earth.
[05:01.260 --> 05:08.140]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy. I am blessed
[05:08.140 --> 05:14.380]  to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed
[05:14.380 --> 05:20.220]  with silencing us. They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed. It's
[05:20.220 --> 05:26.140]  came over. And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[05:26.140 --> 05:31.620]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech. That's why when
[05:31.620 --> 05:37.100]  you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com, it changes
[05:37.100 --> 05:41.500]  the world. And that's why when you go to infowarstore.com and get amazing products that

[05:56.980 --> 06:24.300]  you all for your support.
[06:26.980 --> 06:41.580]  It is Tuesday, November 1st, 2022, seven days from the incredibly important historic
[06:41.580 --> 06:49.460]  midterm. All right, I am not doing this for dramatic effect, but I'm going to air a special
[06:49.460 --> 06:58.940]  report right now so that I can call myself and really try to come up with proper statements
[06:58.940 --> 07:04.420]  that will address the true magnitude of this. I've been on air 28 years and we've broken
[07:04.420 --> 07:09.260]  thousands of major stories and the story that's now broke, we know it's true. We first broke
[07:09.260 --> 07:20.100]  it along with zero hedge six years ago and of course, other pieces of it before that.
[07:20.100 --> 07:29.820]  But this news proves a governmental corporate big tech coup is in control of the United States
[07:29.820 --> 07:35.180]  and works directly with the European Union and is absolutely completely criminal and
[07:35.180 --> 07:40.500]  illegal at every level and will be the enforcement for the social credit score that is the mark
[07:40.500 --> 07:49.180]  of the beast system. So I'm going to air this special report on the Pelosi October surprise
[07:49.180 --> 07:58.020]  and then I'm going to go right to headline for the live show because I was just here
[07:58.020 --> 08:01.980]  last night and this morning and I'm for the show reading more of these documents that
[08:01.980 --> 08:10.020]  have come out via four year request and lawsuits and it's just the holy grail of evil and we
[08:10.020 --> 08:14.340]  knew this when you hear me lay all this out you'll go well Alex we've heard this a hundred
[08:14.340 --> 08:21.020]  times a thousand times but this is all confirming exactly how they do it. We already reverse
[08:21.020 --> 08:31.460]  engineered it and it's exactly what we said except it's worse and it is Obama and the
[08:31.460 --> 08:36.500]  CIA and the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller foundations running the whole damn thing.
[08:36.500 --> 08:40.380]  So here's a special report we're going to come back and I'm going to hit the biggest
[08:40.380 --> 08:49.540]  news ever stay with us.
[08:49.540 --> 08:56.500]  In the wake of breaking news with little details it was only a matter of hours before the Democrats
[08:56.500 --> 09:02.900]  mockingbird media had begun to politicize and twist the narrative of the attack regarding
[09:02.900 --> 09:04.380]  Paul Pelosi.
[09:04.380 --> 09:08.540]  Stories that I knew warning from law enforcement of a heightened threat to the midterm elections
[09:08.540 --> 09:11.020]  and the safety of elected leaders.
[09:11.020 --> 09:15.380]  Investigators say DePappy had planned to tie up Paul Pelosi and wait for the speaker to
[09:15.380 --> 09:20.940]  return home. Mr. Pelosi was taken to the hospital. Representative Pelosi's office tells us he
[09:20.940 --> 09:26.860]  underwent a successful surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his
[09:26.860 --> 09:29.460]  right arm and hands.
[09:29.460 --> 09:33.460]  Tonight's bulletin from the FBI warns of a heightened threat fueled by a rise in domestic
[09:33.460 --> 09:39.540]  violence extremism driven by ideological grievances. Potential targets include candidates running
[09:39.540 --> 09:44.900]  for public office, elected officials, election workers and others. The FBI warns the threat
[09:44.900 --> 09:56.140]  will continue even after election day.
[09:56.140 --> 10:02.140]  We have to understand that you know this attack was most likely done because of that rhetoric
[10:02.140 --> 10:06.140]  being being spread like that's my prediction is that we're going to find out that this
[10:06.140 --> 10:11.060]  was someone with with very far right motivations and someone who follows people like Tucker
[10:11.060 --> 10:16.140]  Carlson like Ben Shapiro like Matt Walsh. That's my prediction here and Tucker Carlson
[10:16.140 --> 10:20.820]  has one of the largest platforms in this country that spreads his white nationalist
[10:20.820 --> 10:25.100]  message to millions and millions of impressionable viewers every day. You know the right wing
[10:25.100 --> 10:29.180]  wants you to believe that public schools are an indoctrination center for communist
[10:29.180 --> 10:35.140]  theory. I wish they were but actually people are not learning such things in school as
[10:35.140 --> 10:41.300]  the clock runs out on the 2022 election, an outcome which could not only bring a response
[10:41.300 --> 10:47.820]  to the corpocratic neo-Marxist cancer festering in the American body politic but also result
[10:47.820 --> 10:53.460]  in prosecution for a host of Democrats that had avoided scrutiny including the president
[10:53.460 --> 10:57.780]  of the United States. The October surprise was imminent.
[10:57.780 --> 11:04.860]  It's reported that the same chant was used by this guy they have in custody that was used
[11:04.860 --> 11:16.580]  on January 6th. The chant was where's Nancy? Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy? This is despicable.
[11:16.580 --> 11:25.260]  There's no place in America. There's too much violence, political violence, too much hatred,
[11:25.260 --> 11:36.260]  too much vitriol. And what makes us think that one party can talk about stolen elections,
[11:36.260 --> 11:44.220]  COVID being a hoax, there's all a bunch of lies and it not affect people who may not
[11:44.220 --> 11:53.260]  be so well balanced. What makes us think that it's not going to corrode the political climate?
[11:53.260 --> 11:59.340]  The alleged attacker, David DePappi, a Canadian illegal immigrant, had spent his time in Berkeley,
[11:59.340 --> 12:06.020]  California making hemp jewelry and contributing to Bay Area nudist activism at a residence
[12:06.020 --> 12:12.500]  replete with a rainbow flag and a Black Lives Matter sign. However, they dared to deny
[12:12.500 --> 12:18.900]  the implausible narrative of 9-11, not exactly the far-right extremist Nazis they would have
[12:18.900 --> 12:26.780]  us believe DePappi was a product of. According to KTVU, DePappi had supposedly had with him
[12:26.780 --> 12:33.380]  a manifesto that contained anti-government COVID beliefs and a list of other politicians
[12:33.380 --> 12:39.260]  he planned to target. Additionally, the media had immediately derided DePappi's online
[12:39.260 --> 12:45.060]  writings detailing COVID vaccine danger, the great reset, and the epidemic of pedophile
[12:45.060 --> 12:51.060]  normalization as crazed conspiracy nonsense just buzzwords to be feared.
[12:51.060 --> 12:55.700]  The problem is people keep egging these people on. There are people on the television across
[12:55.700 --> 12:59.620]  the street from us that egg these people on to talk about cabals and stuff and people
[12:59.620 --> 13:05.860]  secretly run in the world and it's kind of like women either. So that's happening right
[13:05.860 --> 13:09.580]  now and then on top of it you have political figures. You have the previous president I
[13:09.580 --> 13:15.820]  would say it's posting about QAnon on his social media platforms which is just about
[13:15.820 --> 13:20.300]  this same cabal that the guy is talking about. So look, it doesn't really matter at the
[13:20.300 --> 13:27.420]  end of the day because right now there are people advocating for these conspiracy theories
[13:27.420 --> 13:34.500]  out there so of course people who don't know this is a game to these politicians are going
[13:34.500 --> 13:35.660]  to take it out on real people.
[13:35.660 --> 13:41.820]  Oddly, DePappi hadn't posted anything online for 15 years until reappearing in August of
[13:41.820 --> 13:47.260]  2022, just months before a forthcoming October surprise.
[13:47.260 --> 13:53.220]  But the real questions, per usual, open up gaping holes in the Pelosi-DePappi narrative.
[13:53.220 --> 13:58.940]  For instance, how and why does a man wearing underwear carry a manifesto with him? And what
[13:58.940 --> 14:05.620]  about the possible depravity of Pelosi's alcoholic husband? Was DePappi there for another reason
[14:05.620 --> 14:11.220]  – why did Pelosi tell dispatchers DePappi was a friend?
[14:11.220 --> 14:26.140]  Questions that come to mind after others in the California Democratic Party within the
[14:26.140 --> 14:51.140]  circles of the Pelosi's have revealed their true colors.
[14:51.140 --> 15:03.060]  Anyone would assume that at the very least Nancy Pelosi's multi-million dollar home
[15:03.060 --> 15:08.860]  in crime-riddled San Francisco would be outfitted with an equally expensive government-funded
[15:08.860 --> 15:14.900]  security system to protect the third in line to the presidency and her expensive ice cream
[15:14.900 --> 15:20.380]  freezer. And why would police allow DePappi to continue assaulting Paul Pelosi after they
[15:20.380 --> 15:26.820]  arrived on scene? Furthermore, why was DePappi injured? Details that could certainly clear
[15:26.820 --> 15:32.860]  some things up but continue to remain a mystery. Of course, we have been here a thousand times
[15:32.860 --> 15:38.760]  before the left despises questions because the truth is lurking and there is nothing
[15:38.760 --> 15:55.660]  more frightening for those invested in lies than the emergence of the truth. John Bowne

[19:34.000 --> 19:38.640]  forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those
[19:38.640 --> 19:47.320]  myself, it's unsustainable, so please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com where you
[19:47.320 --> 19:52.640]  can make straight donations, five, ten, fifty-hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue
[19:52.640 --> 19:56.880]  to persevere, I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out, thank you for
[19:56.880 --> 20:01.240]  your support, wouldn't be without you, saveinfowars.com.
[20:01.240 --> 20:10.920]  Pleading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:10.920 --> 20:13.880]  This is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[20:13.880 --> 20:17.840]  Right now I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[20:17.840 --> 20:21.840]  The chair is against the wall, John has a long mustache.
[20:21.840 --> 20:25.160]  This is the heart of 1776.
[20:25.160 --> 20:29.320]  It's twelve o'clock Americans, another day closer to victory, and for all of you out there
[20:29.320 --> 20:36.320]  on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[20:36.320 --> 20:57.600]  For all intents and purposes, America is dead, republic is gone, but unlike a human, when
[20:57.600 --> 21:04.120]  they die they're dead, an idea or a system can be rebooted or resurrected from the dead.
[21:04.120 --> 21:10.080]  But if you don't admit the country is gone, and what's left of it being sacked and looted
[21:10.080 --> 21:13.720]  in a hostile globalist world government takeover, you're a fool.
[21:13.720 --> 21:19.080]  And if you don't recognize that, as above so below, the attacks you see on the wide
[21:19.080 --> 21:24.840]  scale against our infrastructure, our culture, our families, our very lives, is directed
[21:24.840 --> 21:28.240]  directly at you and I on the bottom.
[21:28.240 --> 21:35.440]  Alright, this is undoubtedly the biggest news since the founding of the country in 1776,
[21:35.440 --> 21:42.640]  and the plan they're running here in America is being duplicated across the world, except
[21:42.640 --> 21:47.120]  for communist China that's even further ahead than us, and our controllers are duplicating
[21:47.120 --> 21:50.160]  what China's done.
[21:50.160 --> 21:55.520]  Now we have congressional documents, we have leak documents, we have four-year documents
[21:55.520 --> 22:03.800]  that have all come out in lawsuits and in other ways confirming that under Obama, big
[22:03.800 --> 22:13.800]  tech, big banks, big media with foundations right now in the grassroots have set up spy
[22:13.800 --> 22:28.000]  networks in churches, in businesses, in universities, in charity organizations so that they have
[22:28.000 --> 22:35.040]  access and placement, placement and access in every facet of life.
[22:35.040 --> 22:39.440]  They're motivated, they believe they're on a winning team, that's why you see the coming
[22:39.440 --> 22:45.400]  out of the pedophilia, the coming out of all of the incredible tyranny is because they
[22:45.400 --> 22:52.680]  have gone operational, they are at war with everybody.
[22:52.680 --> 22:58.360]  And so if you go back to this broadcast 25 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, they
[22:58.360 --> 23:03.040]  were just putting footage on screen from 15 years ago, where we showed you documents and
[23:03.040 --> 23:07.040]  reports where the federal government had infiltrated secretly and taken over most churches and
[23:07.040 --> 23:13.400]  they give them the scripts of what to say, both Catholic and Protestant, that it's not
[23:13.400 --> 23:16.360]  our government, it's the criminals that are in charge of our government and they're training
[23:16.360 --> 23:22.560]  them the constitutionalist, gun owners, Christians, veterans or the enemy unless they adopt the
[23:22.560 --> 23:24.800]  anti-human culture of the left.
[23:24.800 --> 23:31.680]  So this is a cult.
[23:31.680 --> 23:36.840]  And so the big news here is more documents have been made public, which federal government
[23:36.840 --> 23:43.320]  admits are real, that going back the first week of Biden being put into office two years
[23:43.320 --> 23:50.960]  ago or 22 months ago, within a week of him in office they had press conferences declaring
[23:50.960 --> 23:54.360]  war on the American people and gun owners and veterans and people that question elections
[23:54.360 --> 23:59.200]  and forced inoculations and the rest of it.
[23:59.200 --> 24:05.600]  But they then set up through a federal office, a secret office of disinformation governance
[24:05.600 --> 24:10.640]  board that still had money in it from when Obama left and put it into the Defense Authorization
[24:10.640 --> 24:17.440]  Act and the Countering Disinformation and Foreign Propaganda Act, but pointed at the
[24:17.440 --> 24:25.760]  American people, the Disinformation Governance Board.
[24:25.760 --> 24:33.480]  Now in these documents that are also transcripts of the communiques and battle plans, remember
[24:33.480 --> 24:37.320]  they go way further than even this and this is complete felony, absolutely criminal,
[24:37.320 --> 24:40.960]  they shall be arrested now, but they do even more on the ground because we've been the
[24:40.960 --> 24:41.960]  victim of it.
[24:41.960 --> 24:45.720]  We've learned a lot of intelligence dealing with their operatives on the ground, which
[24:45.720 --> 24:51.200]  again every weapon they turn against us, every weapon they use against us shall not prosper.
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.040]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper if we just stay focused and don't quit with
[24:55.040 --> 24:56.040]  God's help.
[24:56.040 --> 25:02.480]  But this is such a huge issue because this is an authoritarian spy grid takeover and
[25:02.480 --> 25:09.000]  in the documents they coordinate the federal government homeland security with big tech,
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.240]  with banks, with universities, with philanthropic organizations, with everybody and they give
[25:16.240 --> 25:24.320]  battle plan orders that so the public doesn't know it's the government or Biden or Obama
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.160]  running this that actually says this, we're going to put you in charge with our case
[25:29.160 --> 25:37.800]  officers that are at the ADL, actually says it, Southern Primary Law Center and our agents
[25:37.800 --> 25:41.800]  in the military, their agents in our military, they know they're like Specter, this is like
[25:41.800 --> 25:48.040]  a James Bond movie and even local police, that's why they're purging the police to get
[25:48.040 --> 25:50.680]  the good ones out and put in their people.
[25:50.680 --> 25:55.600]  So this is a total criminal takeover.
[25:55.600 --> 26:01.800]  Now I'm not at liberty to get into all this right now but I will at a later date and I've
[26:01.800 --> 26:09.200]  foreshadowed this before but we've dealt with at least three waves of attempted infiltrations
[26:09.200 --> 26:15.360]  and everybody that works here gets contacted by the national media and by these tank tanks
[26:15.360 --> 26:16.800]  and they get offered money.
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.640]  A lot of the crews sitting there in the control room has been called by them, they've told
[26:21.640 --> 26:22.640]  me.
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.160]  They start digging into your past, they're trying to threaten you but you can't be intimidated
[26:26.160 --> 26:32.640]  by this because this is an organized criminal group and if they win it's all over for everybody.
[26:32.640 --> 26:39.480]  It's a cult and where are the Republican leadership on this, they know all about this, if I knew
[26:39.480 --> 26:44.040]  about this 20 years ago they know about it, if I made films about it 15 years ago they
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.400]  know about it.
[26:47.400 --> 26:53.520]  Police State 4, my last police state film is just about this and so it's been going on
[26:53.520 --> 27:01.240]  a long time and at first they built the network saying oh it's to stop violent Muslim extremists,
[27:01.240 --> 27:04.480]  that's why I want everybody to be spies in the infrastructure.
[27:04.480 --> 27:08.160]  But just like Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark where he's putting the sand
[27:08.160 --> 27:15.520]  where the idol is, they took Islam off the lever and they've now moved the American people
[27:15.520 --> 27:19.240]  onto it as the bag of sand.
[27:19.240 --> 27:28.520]  Where the target, the training dummy for the attack dog was the Muslims but now as I warned
[27:28.520 --> 27:34.760]  you 20 plus years ago the real target was always red, white and blue, hardcore Americans
[27:34.760 --> 27:38.920]  that wouldn't roll over to this criminal takeover.
[27:38.920 --> 27:45.880]  So they're removing bin Laden off of the pedestal and putting us on it as the new target and
[27:45.880 --> 27:49.640]  of course the left going along with this, they'll be the next target as well.
[27:49.640 --> 27:52.520]  First they came for Alex Jones, then they came for everybody else.
[27:52.520 --> 27:55.640]  This is a tried and true formulae.
[27:55.640 --> 28:02.760]  I remember under Obama they hired Marcus Wolf, the former head of the East German Stasi to
[28:02.760 --> 28:07.720]  come and work with big tech and the federal government to shut up the embryonic system
[28:07.720 --> 28:09.080]  of what we're now witnessing.
[28:09.080 --> 28:12.320]  That was in the Washington Post, like it was a good thing.
[28:12.320 --> 28:19.160]  Google in Germany moved into the former headquarters of the Stasi, can't make this up.
[28:19.160 --> 28:21.640]  They do all this on purpose.
[28:21.640 --> 28:25.160]  So when you listen to this broadcast, you need to understand, I'm not Gonzo journalist
[28:25.160 --> 28:30.000]  writing myself into it, I'm their number one enemy because I'd been understanding them.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.160]  When I would have conversations with Trump and he was telling me, oh you're a great guy,
[28:33.160 --> 28:37.600]  pat me on the head like politics and say listen sir, there's a stay behind network.
[28:37.600 --> 28:43.000]  There's $3 billion in this fund, they've got infiltrators in the White House, here's their
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.240]  names and here's the people inside running this disinformation operation that's really
[28:47.240 --> 28:49.000]  there to remove you from office.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.200]  You'd say very interesting that all hell broke loose because that gave those reports
[28:53.200 --> 28:54.200]  to the president.
[28:54.200 --> 29:00.200]  We'll be right back.
[29:00.200 --> 29:02.000]  It's our best seller.
[29:02.000 --> 29:05.840]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[29:05.840 --> 29:10.560]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and
[29:10.560 --> 29:15.120]  how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller and it's been
[29:15.120 --> 29:17.800]  sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[29:17.800 --> 29:23.240]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system but it helps every cellular
[29:23.240 --> 29:24.240]  function of the body.
[29:24.240 --> 29:29.040]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[29:29.040 --> 29:31.600]  need to live and be healthy.
[29:31.600 --> 29:36.160]  All means without these things you die and so much of the food is debased, there's so
[29:36.160 --> 29:41.280]  many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product
[29:41.280 --> 29:42.280]  like this.
[29:42.280 --> 29:45.400]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there but this is amongst the
[29:45.400 --> 29:48.920]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[29:48.920 --> 29:53.040]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally
[29:53.040 --> 29:56.840]  back in stock at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[29:56.840 --> 29:59.920]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock infowarstore.com.
[29:59.920 --> 30:05.840]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[30:05.840 --> 30:11.200]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[30:11.200 --> 30:15.040]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[30:15.040 --> 30:16.040]  to speak freely.
[30:16.040 --> 30:19.280]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or
[30:19.280 --> 30:20.720]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[30:20.720 --> 30:25.040]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and I knew they were planning all
[30:25.040 --> 30:29.200]  of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[30:29.200 --> 30:30.200]  your support.
[30:30.200 --> 30:33.320]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[30:33.320 --> 30:37.800]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[30:37.800 --> 30:41.440]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[30:41.440 --> 30:43.120]  because of your past support.

[33:00.880 --> 33:10.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:10.480 --> 33:13.760]  Let's go ahead and play the clergy response team clip.
[33:13.760 --> 33:20.400]  Now remember, before this became national news, we got the secret documents from pastors
[33:20.400 --> 33:25.320]  who have been recruited by FEMA, we posted the secret documents with FEMA phone numbers,
[33:25.320 --> 33:29.280]  train your flocks to turn their guns in, train your flocks to go to FEMA camps, train your
[33:29.280 --> 33:32.000]  flocks to take force inoculations.
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.080]  People didn't believe us, just like they didn't believe the MYAC report.
[33:35.080 --> 33:38.800]  Then suddenly local news began reporting it but like it was a good thing.
[33:38.800 --> 33:41.560]  Listen, will martial law ever be a reality?
[33:41.560 --> 33:45.600]  And the preachers are there being paid by the government, faith-based initiative now
[33:45.600 --> 33:50.200]  continuing under Obama to tell their flocks to do what they're told by the authorities
[33:50.200 --> 33:53.560]  and the government's biggest threat is the American people.
[33:53.560 --> 33:55.640]  That's a quote.
[33:55.640 --> 34:00.640]  So this is specifically the pastors getting ready for us to go to FEMA camps and there's
[34:00.640 --> 34:04.200]  thousands of pieces of evidence like this and Glenn Beck saying it doesn't exist.
[34:04.200 --> 34:09.160]  Law ever become a reality in America?
[34:09.160 --> 34:15.160]  Some fear any nuclear, biological, or chemical attack on U.S. territory might trigger just
[34:15.160 --> 34:16.160]  that.
[34:16.160 --> 34:20.040]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered, the clergy would help the government with
[34:20.040 --> 34:23.200]  potentially their biggest problem, us.
[34:23.200 --> 34:26.400]  From my cold, dead hands.
[34:26.400 --> 34:32.480]  Charlton Heston's famous declaration captures a truly American value, the overarching desire
[34:32.480 --> 34:34.440]  to protect our freedoms.
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.480]  But gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane
[34:39.480 --> 34:41.000]  Katrina in New Orleans.
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  U.S. troops also arrived, something far easier to do even now thanks to last year's elimination
[34:47.000 --> 34:55.800]  of the 1878 Posse-Kamitana Act that forbid U.S. troops from policing on American soil.
[34:55.800 --> 35:00.280]  If martial law weren't acted here at home, like depicted in the movie The Siege, easing
[35:00.280 --> 35:03.520]  public fears and quelling dissent would be critical.
[35:03.520 --> 35:08.040]  And that's exactly what the clergy response team, as it's called, helped accomplish in
[35:08.040 --> 35:09.040]  New Orleans.
[35:09.040 --> 35:12.400]  Jeff, the primary thing that we say to anybody is let's cooperate and get this thing over
[35:12.400 --> 35:16.040]  with and then we'll settle the differences once the crisis is over.
[35:16.040 --> 35:20.720]  Such clergy response teams would walk a tightrope between the needs of the government versus
[35:20.720 --> 35:22.360]  the wishes of the public.
[35:22.360 --> 35:27.040]  In a lot of cases, these clergy would already be known in the neighborhoods in which they're
[35:27.040 --> 35:29.520]  helping to diffuse that situation.
[35:29.520 --> 35:33.680]  For the clergy, one of the biggest tools that they will have in helping calm the public
[35:33.680 --> 35:40.920]  down or obey the law is the Bible itself, specifically Romans, Romans 13.
[35:40.920 --> 35:44.640]  Because the government's established by the law, you know, and that's what we believe
[35:44.640 --> 35:45.640]  in the Christian faith.
[35:45.640 --> 35:47.320]  That's what's stated in the scripture.
[35:47.320 --> 35:52.400]  Civil rights advocates believe the amount of public cooperation may depend largely on how
[35:52.400 --> 36:00.920]  long they expect a suspension of their rights might last.
[36:00.920 --> 36:03.160]  So they've been beta testing this for a long time.
[36:03.160 --> 36:06.200]  They've got most of the big preachers.
[36:06.200 --> 36:09.000]  They've got almost all the heads of universities.
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.640]  They've got almost all the police chiefs.
[36:10.640 --> 36:12.120]  They've got the Justice Department, the FBI.
[36:12.120 --> 36:18.120]  They've got almost the complete control of Big Tech and the big telecoms that a purge
[36:18.120 --> 36:25.520]  the military and police to put their people in, and they are infiltrating every facet
[36:25.520 --> 36:33.520]  of society with actual seminars and spy training, starting with Antifa.
[36:33.520 --> 36:38.760]  Now, the Antifa you see on the streets is just the cutouts they pay $20 an hour to be
[36:38.760 --> 36:39.760]  there and carry out violence.
[36:39.760 --> 36:44.400]  But there are professors above them and the government operatives and the FBI above them
[36:44.400 --> 36:50.120]  came out this year that the FBI was coordinating the summer of rage and coordinating Antifa
[36:50.120 --> 36:52.000]  and the murders around the country.
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.440]  So yes, the government's completely taken over at the top.
[36:56.440 --> 37:00.800]  The few Republicans that aren't completely sold out are scared and isolated and are being
[37:00.800 --> 37:05.160]  physically attacked and people are coming to their baseball games.
[37:05.160 --> 37:09.160]  Shooting them, they are coming after everybody.
[37:09.160 --> 37:13.200]  And they already had their lockdowns, they're planning new lockdowns, they had new announcements
[37:13.200 --> 37:17.480]  today in Australia and in Canada and in the US that they're looking to bring back new
[37:17.480 --> 37:18.480]  lockdowns.
[37:18.480 --> 37:19.480]  We have those clips.
[37:19.480 --> 37:26.040]  But the ultramassive news is that the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center are listed in these
[37:26.040 --> 37:31.320]  government documents, DHS, as the bosses.
[37:31.320 --> 37:37.200]  The Homeland Security through an infraguard system signs up executives in the private
[37:37.200 --> 37:44.240]  sector but also in government to have their own little police identification, federal
[37:44.240 --> 37:48.880]  disinformation board badges, they've got other badges, started with infrastructure protection,
[37:48.880 --> 37:52.480]  infraguard, and they talk about all that in here, it's in my film, Police State 3 and
[37:52.480 --> 37:55.880]  Police State 4, it's in those films.
[37:55.880 --> 38:01.480]  And they describe in there how they're then going to have martial law.
[38:01.480 --> 38:04.280]  And you just saw that on local news telling you how great it is.
[38:04.280 --> 38:10.320]  Now it's of the Lord, and quoting Romans 13 out of context, Hitler's favorite Bible
[38:10.320 --> 38:18.040]  verse, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, the things that are God's, was a
[38:18.040 --> 38:21.960]  Pharisees were trying to set Christ up and saying, hey, you don't want to pay your taxes
[38:21.960 --> 38:22.960]  to the Roman governor?
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.760]  And he said, no, that's his system, that's his coin, it's got his face on it, correct?
[38:27.760 --> 38:34.280]  Here to Caesar what's his, and to God's what's God's, and don't bring Caesar's money into
[38:34.280 --> 38:39.760]  the temple, separation of church and state, Congress shall make no law respecting the
[38:39.760 --> 38:44.600]  establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, let's put the first
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.120]  woman on screen, or the freedom of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble
[38:49.120 --> 38:59.320]  for a redress of grievances, first woman that comes out of Jesus' mouth will read that
[38:59.320 --> 39:09.760]  chapter in the Bible, in the New Testament, it's in three gospels, it's important, Congress
[39:09.760 --> 39:13.960]  shall make no law respecting and establish from religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[39:13.960 --> 39:18.800]  thereof, or abridging the freedoms of speech, or the press, or the right of the people to
[39:18.800 --> 39:25.280]  peaceably assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances.
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.600]  That's the first amendment, number one, the most important, after itself defense, because
[39:29.600 --> 39:33.200]  the founders knew the pens mighter than the sword, but if they take the pen away, well,
[39:33.200 --> 39:37.120]  you got to draw your sword.
[39:37.120 --> 39:40.880]  I know I'm on the right side of history, I can be an honorable man in the eyes of my
[39:40.880 --> 39:46.440]  ancestors and my peers, but I know why most people roll over to this, because they're
[39:46.440 --> 39:52.000]  up against organized government, offshore, mega corporation crime, and they go scoop
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.960]  up in the universities with the psychological test and programs, these people that aren't
[39:57.960 --> 40:06.400]  going to get jobs in the private sector, they're going to get jobs running our lives, as our
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.320]  homazars, as political officers over us.
[40:10.320 --> 40:13.840]  When you read these documents, I'm going to start covering that segment, they're bone
[40:13.840 --> 40:20.680]  chilling, the government says, so they don't figure out we're illegally doing this, and
[40:20.680 --> 40:24.040]  controlling big tech and the universities and the schools and the media and running
[40:24.040 --> 40:30.760]  all this, Democrat hijacked government, we will give the directives to our officers and
[40:30.760 --> 40:37.520]  our agents in NGOs, and the NGOs are, as I've told you, the ADL, so they're probably law
[40:37.520 --> 40:42.240]  center and the list goes on and on, Black Lives Matter, you name it.
[40:42.240 --> 40:48.320]  So they all wear multiple hats, but your antifa leaders, your Black Lives Matter leaders,
[40:48.320 --> 40:56.880]  they're all government agents of a hijacked rogue government state, and they've been promised
[40:56.880 --> 41:02.960]  power and control once this takeover is complete, and they're all around us, they're everywhere,
[41:02.960 --> 41:04.920]  and it's a real problem.
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.920]  But they don't have the moral high ground we do, they're the criminals, not us.
[41:09.920 --> 41:16.360]  Great documents outline DHS plans to police disinformation.
[41:16.360 --> 41:26.000]  The intercept broke the big story, a secret disinformation governance board.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.520]  Set up for the war on terror, but always for the American people.
[41:31.520 --> 41:35.640]  Chilling conversations uncovered, it tells DHS collusion with big tech to censor speech,
[41:35.640 --> 41:36.640]  town hall.
[41:36.640 --> 41:42.680]  You see the corruption on the surface, but it's the tip of the iceberg, that I've been
[41:42.680 --> 41:47.600]  fighting these people for decades, I've been down here in a submarine, and I've seen it
[41:47.600 --> 41:48.720]  and it's bad.
[41:48.720 --> 41:51.040]  So horrible, it's hard to even admit to myself.
[41:51.040 --> 41:55.840]  Docs show Facebook and Twitter closely collaborating with the Department of Homeland Security FBI
[41:55.840 --> 42:03.280]  to quote police disinfo plans to expand censorship on topics like withdrawal from Afghanistan,
[42:03.280 --> 42:09.520]  origins of COVID, info that undermines trust in financial institutions.
[42:09.520 --> 42:13.320]  Tim Poole says this may be the biggest story of our lives, it is, it is our lives, they've
[42:13.320 --> 42:14.320]  taken them over.
[42:14.320 --> 42:19.520]  The direct violation of law and the Constitution on a scale designed to subvert our elections
[42:19.520 --> 42:22.400]  and control the populations.
[42:22.400 --> 42:29.480]  Here's the actual CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee that has a secret bureau called the
[42:29.480 --> 42:31.360]  Disinformation Governance Board.
[42:31.360 --> 42:43.760]  You might want to go read this massive document for yourself.
[42:43.760 --> 42:47.160]  It's a lot worse when we come back, I'll show you directly in the document where they say
[42:47.160 --> 42:55.200]  the ADO is in full command, full command, watching you, listening to you, tracking you, and
[42:55.200 --> 43:00.280]  preparing to take your bank account and put you in a death camp, we'll be right back.
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.760]  This is our best seller, we first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate
[43:04.760 --> 43:05.760]  seller.
[43:05.760 --> 43:10.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[43:10.440 --> 43:15.040]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller and it's
[43:15.040 --> 43:17.800]  been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[43:17.800 --> 43:23.240]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system but it helps every cellular
[43:23.240 --> 43:28.240]  function of the body, it has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential
[43:28.240 --> 43:31.640]  vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[43:31.640 --> 43:36.080]  Essential means without these things you die and so much of the food is debased, there's
[43:36.080 --> 43:40.920]  so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with
[43:40.920 --> 43:41.920]  a product like this.
[43:41.920 --> 43:45.440]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there but this is amongst the
[43:45.440 --> 43:49.960]  very best and it's a low price and it funds the infill war so the only way you lose is
[43:49.960 --> 43:55.400]  not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at infillwarstore.com

[44:00.120 --> 44:04.780]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the global stone documents from their own
[44:04.780 --> 44:06.840]  admissions is now happening.
[44:06.840 --> 44:11.120]  Infill war is credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's because of
[44:11.120 --> 44:16.200]  your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the
[44:16.200 --> 44:22.400]  boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air but now we're reaching the most critical
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.520]  juncture in the fight together.
[44:25.520 --> 44:29.960]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[44:29.960 --> 44:33.880]  In my decades on air I've never asked for personal donations but I'm being forced by
[44:33.880 --> 44:39.400]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[44:39.400 --> 44:40.400]  It's unsustainable.
[44:40.400 --> 44:48.840]  So please visit saveinfillwars.com, saveinfillwars.com where you can make straight donations, $5,
[44:48.840 --> 44:52.960]  $500, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.

[45:00.080 --> 45:04.880]  Think about a world without infillwars.

[45:09.200 --> 45:14.480]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is infillwars.
[45:14.480 --> 45:19.600]  Think about how infillwars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and
[45:19.600 --> 45:27.080]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[45:27.080 --> 45:30.600]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[45:30.600 --> 45:36.360]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[45:36.360 --> 45:40.840]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[45:40.840 --> 45:46.880]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit and now infillwars is facing its darkest hours
[45:46.880 --> 45:50.600]  it isn't going to give up, without your support we can be shut down.

[47:00.640 --> 47:06.720]  Meeting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[30:43.580 --> 47:59.840]  so in the year 2022 it is out in the open.
[47:59.840 --> 48:10.920]  That a consortium of leftist think tanks that are really CIA FBI on record are directing
[48:10.920 --> 48:18.800]  the banks, the universities, big tech, the military, most of the police departments,
[48:18.800 --> 48:26.560]  Thoros has put in thousands of DA's and county attorneys, he's got 22 state attorney generals
[48:26.560 --> 48:32.840]  under his control, we talk about death camps, they're building emergency COVID centers all
[48:32.840 --> 48:38.800]  over the world under UN auspices all of the same specifications, they already sent tens
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.520]  of thousands of old people in New York alone to their deaths on ventilators under orders
[48:43.520 --> 48:53.720]  to kill them, this is all a test for total power and total control.
[48:53.720 --> 49:01.240]  State documents outline DHS plan to police disinformation with a secret disinformation
[49:01.240 --> 49:09.040]  governance board and remember what they just announced two months ago that was already
[49:09.040 --> 49:15.440]  set up it turned out, a ministry of truth, a ministry of countering disinformation in
[49:15.440 --> 49:29.520]  the federal government, Joe Biden's ministry of truth, there's the hills headline.
[49:29.520 --> 49:34.360]  This is it, we're in an authoritarian high tech dictatorship that's just mopping up
[49:34.360 --> 49:38.600]  what's left of the country, cutting off the pipeline, shutting down the oil drilling,
[49:38.600 --> 49:43.560]  shutting off the diesel, shutting us down with the lockdowns to break the economy was
[49:43.560 --> 49:53.400]  just the start, they're at total war with you.
[49:53.400 --> 49:59.720]  And I'm really sad to have to report this to you my friends, but I have personally experienced
[49:59.720 --> 50:04.920]  democratic party and think tanks and the intelligence agencies rigging trials against me, finding
[50:04.920 --> 50:11.480]  me guilty with judges, not letting us put on evidence, then announcing trillions in money
[50:11.480 --> 50:14.680]  they want because it's all meant to break our will, it's not going to break our will
[50:14.680 --> 50:27.600]  because we know how bad it's going to get if we don't turn this around and quickly.
[50:27.600 --> 50:32.120]  So here's more of the subsections, the documents that folks are pouring through.
[50:32.120 --> 50:37.000]  Jim Poole's writes the biggest story of our lives, direct violation of the constitution,
[50:37.000 --> 50:42.760]  or law, state law on a scale designed to subvert our elections and control the population.
[50:42.760 --> 50:48.960]  And that's really out of all this, the biggest issue they admit it's to subvert the 2020
[50:48.960 --> 50:49.960]  election.
[50:49.960 --> 50:55.800]  These are documents, most of these documents are before Biden got in and then there's more
[50:55.800 --> 51:00.720]  after where they were working the federal government that Trump didn't get control of
[51:00.720 --> 51:09.120]  because it's their people, they're just ignoring, he didn't know how bad it was, and the same
[51:09.120 --> 51:12.760]  ones gave him bad medical advice, did everything else, that's what these people are doing,
[51:12.760 --> 51:17.720]  they are ruthless criminals and they've stolen an election even if they didn't physically
[51:17.720 --> 51:21.960]  steal it with mail-in ballots which we know they did, they stole it by suppressing and
[51:21.960 --> 51:23.200]  censoring the internet.
[51:23.200 --> 51:29.560]  Remember the FBI Zuckerberg said, called them up and said don't allow this Hunter Biden
[51:29.560 --> 51:33.760]  story, it's Russian disinfo even though it wasn't, and he said oh they told us all the
[51:33.760 --> 51:38.960]  time what to do, he was covering his ass because he knows all this is coming out.
[51:38.960 --> 51:44.480]  The other big question is where's Senator Paul Josh Hawley, I mean we've seen Ted Cruz
[51:44.480 --> 51:47.680]  that goes along with most of this but acts like he's against it, he's been out speaking
[51:47.680 --> 51:48.680]  out.
[51:48.680 --> 51:52.800]  This is the number one issue with seven days of the midterms, that's what these people
[51:52.800 --> 51:53.800]  are doing.
[51:53.800 --> 52:02.440]  And here's the document, one of the documents, the CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee,
[52:02.440 --> 52:06.040]  Judge Joe Brown's power went out yesterday, that's why it couldn't come on, he is coming
[52:06.040 --> 52:16.920]  on today, may have some other big guests as well but I'll be asking him about this, FBI
[52:16.920 --> 52:21.560]  agents, it lists their names for communication directly with Facebook every day telling them
[52:21.560 --> 52:25.280]  what to take down and what to do and what to suppress, it's the documents where they
[52:25.280 --> 52:30.800]  were giving the orders, but they go on to say but don't take your order from me, we're
[52:30.800 --> 52:36.200]  going to have the ADL and other groups send you the order so they don't know it's us,
[52:36.200 --> 52:43.200]  actually says it.
[52:43.200 --> 52:50.640]  The emails, document, show close collaboration with the DHS and private sector, and the head
[52:50.640 --> 53:01.760]  of Twitter, vagina gobbler, vagina gobbler, vagina g'day, met monthly with DHS to discuss
[53:01.760 --> 53:07.800]  censorship plans, Microsoft execs tested DHS platforms have got to get comfortable with
[53:07.800 --> 53:20.600]  the government and their secret disinfo governance board, but none of a secret we see where the
[53:20.600 --> 53:29.480]  rubber meets the road, pre-discussional, deliberative, unclassified for official use only, you can
[53:29.480 --> 53:34.000]  read all their plans to shut you down, all their plans to censor you, all their plans
[53:34.000 --> 53:43.320]  to illegally surveil you, subcommittee members return to the recommendation for the CISA
[53:43.320 --> 53:48.220]  to amplify trusted information and discuss designated a point of contact as clearing
[53:48.220 --> 53:53.960]  house for trusted information such as Mr. Hell suggested designating the ISAC as the
[53:53.960 --> 53:59.320]  clearing house for information to avoid appearance of government propaganda, they go on to say
[53:59.320 --> 54:09.280]  to then use third party NGOs like the ADL and others to avoid it being known the government
[54:09.280 --> 54:13.960]  was illegally running it, representatives from JP Morgan Chase attended virtually all
[54:13.960 --> 54:19.480]  DHS meetings about federal government efforts to censor disinformation on social media,
[54:19.480 --> 54:25.080]  are they laying the groundwork for debanking to become an even more mainstream strategy,
[54:25.080 --> 54:30.760]  I think so, just in behind closed doors US government has reportedly used its power to
[54:30.760 --> 54:36.280]  shape online discourse DHS to expand censorship on topics like origins of covid, efficacy
[54:36.280 --> 54:45.880]  of vaccines, racial justice, Afghanistan withdrawal and more, and it goes on and on and on and
[54:45.880 --> 55:00.400]  on and on, we'll talk to Judge Joe Brown about this coming up, it's just I mean, Nixon thought
[55:00.400 --> 55:07.360]  about using the FBI against his political enemies and that he was called the greatest
[55:07.360 --> 55:14.080]  criminal ever, but they're actually doing it on a scale never before done, I mean this
[55:14.080 --> 55:20.120]  is as bad as communist China and it's just going on out in the open, they should all
[55:20.120 --> 55:28.560]  go to prison, it's an illegitimate government, they stole the election, they meddled in everything,
[55:28.560 --> 55:34.360]  they suppressed you, I'm an air special report in the short next segment, long segment coming

[59:45.520 --> 1:00:05.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:11.520]  The official president of the United States has warned the world they will face Armageddon
[1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:15.600]  if Russia uses tactical nukes in Ukraine.
[1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:20.880]  And when the Russian president said that the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is senseless,
[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:27.440]  the Biden administration reversed the no first use and sole purpose policies regarding nuclear
[1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:35.280]  warfare, meaning that the U.S. will now consider first strike nuclear attacks against non-nuclear
[1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:37.280]  threats.
[1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:43.280]  In a surprising break from projection and gaslight, U.S. Congressman Jamie Raskin recently
[1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:47.720]  explained the truth behind the current U.S. policy with Russia.
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:53.680]  Russia is an Orthodox Christian country with traditional social values, and for that reason
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:58.760]  it must be destroyed no matter what the cost to us.
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:03.240]  So this is not a conventional war, this is a jihad.
[1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:07.520]  Jamie Raskin said that out loud, but many in Washington agree with him.
[1:01:07.520 --> 1:01:12.040]  In both parties, they would like to see World War Trans immediately.
[1:01:12.040 --> 1:01:16.640]  On the surface, that's what this is, World War Trans.
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:18.960]  That is what the United States has become.
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:24.960]  To the rest of the world, America has become the land of abortions, castrations, death
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:26.360]  and lies.
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:32.000]  Meanwhile, our diesel fuel is set to run out before the winner, and our leadership could
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  care less.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:37.920]  What are we doing to increase the supply of diesel, given that the Energy Information
[1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:43.440]  Administration said as of October 14th, the U.S. only had about a 25-day supply.
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:48.640]  You have the Northeast and New York already rationing home heating oil.
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:52.720]  What are we doing to prepare for the winter and to ramp up supply of diesel?
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:56.520]  I'll take the question on the diesel, because I just don't have the data on that in front
[1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:57.520]  of me.
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:00.080]  So let me take that, and we'll get back to you on that.
[1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:05.360]  At large, the President has been working very, very hard to make sure that we're – that
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:10.040]  not only are we ready for fluctuations that could come, and of course the prices are going
[1:02:10.040 --> 1:02:16.280]  down, and we think that's important, but that we are also doing what we can to help
[1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:20.200]  our European friends and partners, who are also going to be facing a long cold winter.
[1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:24.840]  We have doubled our commitment, the commitment you made in March for natural gas exports
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:25.840]  to Europe.
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:26.960]  We've doubled that commitment.
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:33.600]  The President has cut off our fuel and given away our emergency reserves.
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:39.160]  Without diesel fuel, the entire nation comes to a halt, and at this point, nothing is being
[1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:40.440]  done to stop it.
[1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:44.160]  The problem is, at this point, there may not be an answer, because there may not be a way
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:46.280]  to avoid a disaster.
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:49.960]  Diesel fuel is not just low in this country, it's low in every Western nation that has
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:52.840]  aligned itself with Ukraine.
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:57.040]  All these nations preparing for World War Trans are running out of diesel fuel.
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:02.520]  While millions may be scratching their heads over World War Trans, too afraid to speak
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:08.200]  against it, Russian President Vladimir Putin recently explained what it's all about and
[1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:10.680]  how Russia has already been there.
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:17.760]  He said, after the 1917 Revolution, the Bolsheviks also said that they would change existing
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:24.280]  ways and customs, and not just political and economic ones, but the very notion of human
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:28.200]  morality and the foundations of a healthy society.
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:35.160]  The destruction of age-old values, religion and relations between people, up to and including
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:37.680]  the total rejection of family.
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:43.640]  All this was proclaimed progress, widely supported around the world back then, and was quite
[1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:46.720]  fashionable, same as today.
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:52.200]  Parent number one, and parent number two, birthing parent, instead of mother.
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:57.600]  I repeat, this is nothing new, and they made such a mess, it still makes one shudder at
[1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:59.600]  times.
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:04.320]  President Putin says America should do what they want, but leave Russia out of it, they've
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:06.000]  already been there.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:11.200]  And seeing as how Americans have become nothing but submissive spectators, it seems as if
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:16.680]  the United States will be going there as well, starting this winter.
[1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:34.920]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:41.600]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:04:41.600 --> 1:05:00.320]  the Infowar.
[1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:05.640]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:06.640]  you.
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.880]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence Infowars, because they rightly see
[1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:16.000]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance, alerting the people, not as of America, but
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:20.160]  the world, for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:26.400]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for Infowars.com,
[1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:30.600]  and to also financially support Infowars.com at the most critical time on our fight by

[1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:46.720]  I am in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now, you have my commitment to never
[1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:50.080]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:24.200]  sites, Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowars.
[1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:27.960]  We're now on hour number two on this live Tuesday, November 1st, a worldwide broadcast,
[1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:33.600]  seven days out for the midterms, and we already had Judge Joe Brown set up to talk about the
[1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:38.880]  election and the censorship and all the tyranny, but it's a perfect day to have him on.
[1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:45.720]  We also have Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us next hour to discuss, look at the headline
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:51.560]  of our show today, Deep State Coo Alert, a secret disinformation governance board is
[1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:57.200]  actively surveilling, censoring Americans in coordination with big tech banks and leftist
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:58.200]  NGOs.
[1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:02.960]  And the documents state, and they admit these documents are real, that the NGOs are really
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:11.640]  secret CIA FBI cutouts run by Democrats, surveilling even your private messages spying on you and
[1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:15.280]  planning to de-platform the average conservative even out of banking.
[1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:21.040]  It's a secret disinformation governance board set up under Obama, state in effect, dearing
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:25.180]  Trump, he didn't know about it, that's what worked against him inside the whole government.
[1:07:25.180 --> 1:07:28.200]  This is literally a coup.
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:33.960]  And then they admit that they manipulated the election and suppressed what the American
[1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:36.240]  people could see and do for Biden.
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:42.720]  It's all in the documents, the CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee.
[1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:49.320]  This is a bureaucratic, big tech, cybersecurity, homeland security coup.
[1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:53.240]  Just like you see in most third world countries where the military takes over, well this is
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.760]  the bureaucracy taking over.
[1:07:55.760 --> 1:08:00.280]  It is unbelievable, I just covered all the documents in the last hour.
[1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:04.160]  Judge Joe Brown, I'm sure you've already been seeing this, and we've already seen a lot
[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:07.680]  of this before, now it's out in the open.
[1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:12.520]  We know they use military propaganda in the COVID fear, I've got all those articles.
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:18.280]  We have where Obama put this into law, last week he was in office in December of, in early
[1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:25.200]  January of 2017, the countering foreign propaganda disinformation act, but it's actually pointed
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:32.120]  at the American people, Judge Joe Brown, with your history as a judge and a journalist and
[1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:37.720]  a commentator, the JudgeJoeBrownShow.com, on Twitter at JudgeJoeBrownTV, I mean this
[1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:42.600]  makes Nixon look like an angel compared to these people.
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:46.600]  This is so illegal, doesn't just violate the First Amendment, you've got government, not
[1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:51.280]  just coordinating censorship that came out in the last year, but actually secretly running
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:55.280]  it and saying in the documents, we can't let the public know we're in charge, so you take
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:59.960]  orders from the ADL and the Southern Property Law Center and Black Lives Matter, it actually
[1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:08.520]  lists more than 100 NGOs that are trained and run by a coup, a breakaway gang, a cabal,
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:11.880]  a putch, inside the federal government.
[1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:18.320]  I mean this is just beyond anything Americans have ever seen, this is beyond 1984, your views
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:19.680]  on this, sir.
[1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:27.120]  Well, I experienced this back in the 60s, let's just say I was an activist back then
[1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:35.920]  when I was in college, but the technology has gotten so profoundly different since then
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:39.960]  that it's frightening what they can do now.
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:50.560]  Back then, you didn't go along with the approved methods or the approved party line, well,
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:57.280]  they invaded your mail, they tapped your phones, they followed you, they had people taking
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:03.040]  shorthand notes then so they could find out what you were saying.
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:08.000]  Now they don't even have to have anybody nearby and I've been looking at it up close
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.680]  and personal for the last week because I announced that I was running for mayor of Memphis, Tennessee
[1:10:13.680 --> 1:10:17.120]  in 2023, that's October.
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:22.360]  And we still have an election coming up in a little while this midterm and they're focusing
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:32.280]  on that so they were the media around here trying to pick two free nobodies and avoid
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:33.280]  me.
[1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:42.400]  So the last several days I've had what looked to be government vehicles parked out in front
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:51.440]  of my house while binoculars are being used to see what I'm up to inside and that's all
[1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:56.880]  because I said we have to bring this country back to the people, we have to bring the
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:03.400]  city back, we have to have manhood in the hood and in the hallway so that we get what
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:04.400]  we need.
[1:11:04.400 --> 1:11:08.560]  And let's be clear, you know this, they're there to let you know they're watching you,
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:10.160]  they're trying to intimidate you.
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:14.160]  Yes, but it doesn't work with me.
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:24.400]  So this thing is going on and I find it interesting in that 14 years ago the Department of Justice
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:29.800]  under the Obama administration put up the money to replace every single voting machine
[1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:35.480]  that we have in this county because it was air finding that the things are hacked and
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:40.960]  the elections are controlled so we have selection not election.
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:47.920]  And for 14 years that money has not been used to replace those machines until right now
[1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:55.680]  for the first time in 14 years after multiple elections, it's claimed that these machines
[1:11:55.680 --> 1:12:02.640]  will be used for the early voting and the voting on the day of the election for the
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:03.760]  first time.
[1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:08.480]  So and I'm glad you raised that the main push in this is election meddling.
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:14.000]  They admit that the government still under the control of the Democrat Party under the
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.160]  presidency of Trump was not just trying to impeach him, not just saying he worked for
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:23.200]  the Russians, but literally manipulating the elections like they do foreign elections illegally,
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:24.840]  like they just did in Brazil.
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:25.840]  This is outrageous.
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:29.240]  What should be what can we do about this?
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:39.320]  We can make it very difficult for those people that we supposedly elect to represent us who
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:41.240]  allow this to happen.
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:44.360]  We need representation in Washington.
[1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:50.800]  We need representation in the state capitals and in the city halls and we don't need someone
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:53.800]  in there who is a surrogate or somebody else.
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:13:00.000]  We need somebody in there who is a representative of the people who has the people's interest
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.160]  at heart who can do something about it.
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:03.160]  Exactly.
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:08.080]  So how do we stop the W.E.F. from getting state and federal level control and then these
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:10.480]  FBI CIA groups getting local control?
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:11.480]  You just said it.
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:14.280]  They're putting their surrogates in everywhere.
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:15.280]  That's right.
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:21.120]  It's like, in fact, the latest little fear that came up is because I was asked at a young
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:27.760]  Democrat function that I crashed just to be heard and they wanted to know, since there
[1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:34.240]  was a black woman that might be running, why wouldn't I withdraw in her favor and I don't
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:36.160]  even know who that person is.
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:38.480]  So what are you supposed to be?
[1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:39.480]  That's misogyny.
[1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:42.760]  The only thing that's posing in their fake lexicon is, oh, I gotta do what the black
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:46.480]  people do, but really it's the liberals controlling it, claiming they own blacks.
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:49.040]  Like Biden said, if you're not, vote for me, you're not black.
[1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:51.000]  So now they trump you with a black woman.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.760]  You can't run because maybe a black woman's going to run.
[1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:55.720]  Think about the sickness of that.
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:14:01.680]  Yeah, it's misogynistic, misogynistic, it's racist and it's sexist.
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:08.520]  Like a woman came running a straight up election where the voters get to decide, you're supposed
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:14.960]  to stack the deck by withdrawing so she can get in and it also had been talking about
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:23.000]  the next mayor of Memphis needs to be someone who can be hands on, face to face, up close
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:28.360]  and personal with the problem and not just throw money at some kind of program sitting
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:29.600]  at a desk.
[1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.360]  So I did that when I was a judge.
[1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:41.120]  I got down in the hood to deal with violence that was going on and has resurfaced again.
[1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:49.320]  We had 15 shooting, six murders and a lot of nasty assaults that went on just over two
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:55.400]  days in his last past weekend here and somebody needs to be able to go down and talk to all
[1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:57.960]  of the people that he's supposed to represent.
[1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:06.000]  So I suggested with an answer that a 19 year old young lady had given me and some of them
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:13.760]  seemed to have been very offended by pointing out that there are men who don't mind protecting
[1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:20.320]  women and trying to make it safe in this world and in this city and this country.
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:24.480]  Well you just said it, they don't want classic warriors, no matter what color they are, men
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:27.560]  standing up and creating civilization.
[1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:34.520]  And one of them who was the chairwoman for the young Democrats actually said, we don't
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:36.160]  need protection.
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:42.280]  How dare him say he would protect us and that kind of thing.
[1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:45.280]  Well that's what got them in trouble down there where they're trying to feel out.
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:48.440]  Well we got to get you in there and it's a perfect microcosm so let's come back and
[1:15:48.440 --> 1:15:51.720]  talk about all this and more with the one thing only, Judge Joe Brown.
[1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:58.720]  Wow stay with us.
[1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:04.840]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:10.520]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:14.160]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.560]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over and
[1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:23.720]  now all over the planet humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:28.880]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:34.120]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com

[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:04.600]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[1:18:04.600 --> 1:18:09.920]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[1:18:09.920 --> 1:18:13.800]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:14.800]  to speak freely.
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:18.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:19.480]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[1:18:19.480 --> 1:18:23.600]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but on air 28 years and I knew they were planning
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:27.920]  all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere but I couldn't have done it without
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:31.320]  your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population of the
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:36.520]  planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:40.160]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:41.880]  because of your past support.

[1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:58.520]  your support.
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:03.680]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's
[1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:08.200]  on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to
[1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:10.920]  their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:14.520]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:19.240]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:23.200]  don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:25.280]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:31.680]  I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from infowarsstore.com,
[1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:35.000]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:40.120]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible and despite the
[1:19:40.120 --> 1:19:46.440]  fact that selling out X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:49.080]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:50.320]  We're not selling it for that.
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:53.800]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[1:19:53.800 --> 1:19:59.520]  At X3 today, 50% off at infowarsstore.com, all supplies last.
[1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:11.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:23.360]  Being a shamelessness, Kathy Hochold is one on Al Sharpton's show to claim that the crime
[1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:27.640]  wave, the one that you're watching, the one that may have hurt you or killed one of your
[1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:30.200]  neighbors, it's all fake.
[1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:33.800]  In a statement that is crazier than anything Alex Jones has ever thought.
[1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:39.280]  They have the accuracy going all across America to try and convince people that in democratic
[1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:40.680]  states they're not as safe.
[1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:42.040]  Well, guess what?
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:45.640]  They're also not only election deniers, they're data deniers.
[1:20:45.640 --> 1:20:51.600]  The data shows that shootings and murders are down in our state by 15%, even in New
[1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:57.680]  York City, down 20% on Long Island where Lee Zeldin comes from.
[1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:00.040]  So that's just a lie, actually.
[1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:02.040]  New York is so dangerous that people are leaving.
[1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:06.560]  Rents haven't gone down because foreign investors are buying up a lot of the buildings, but
[1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:10.160]  people are leaving New York in droves, of course.
[1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:13.680]  But according to Kathy Hochold, in a claim that is truly crazier than anything Alex Jones
[1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:19.760]  has ever even thought, in the shower to himself, Kathy Hochold is telling you that the data
[1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:21.680]  are fake.
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:27.920]  So here you have a city in which, New York City, subway ridership has dropped by 40%
[1:21:27.920 --> 1:21:29.800]  over the last two years.
[1:21:29.800 --> 1:21:32.400]  Now according to Kathy Hochold, it's not because subway riders are being pushed in
[1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:36.480]  front of trains, people being attacked by mentally a whole homeless, no.
[1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:40.120]  It's because apparently millions of New Yorkers are watching Fox News and they've been fooled
[1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:44.920]  by right wing propaganda into thinking the subway is dangerous.
[1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:46.960]  That's what she's suggesting.
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:47.960]  This is too stupid.
[1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:49.640]  This is a lie.
[1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:51.320]  Voters know it's a lie.
[1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:56.320]  And when Democrats get crushed in next week's midterms, it'll be in part because people
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:02.040]  who live in cities and states run by liberals understand that what happened to Paul Pelosi
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:04.640]  could very well happen to them.
[1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:06.720]  And no one would care.
[1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:08.840]  Morning Joe had pretended it never happened.
[1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:13.040]  And of course, Hogel's telling the truth based on a lie.
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:17.480]  Last week the FBI put out crime statistics for last year, they're always a year behind.
[1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:22.600]  And they didn't count America's 100 plus biggest cities that have had the crime explosion.
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:24.960]  So then they said crime went down.
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:26.360]  That is idiotic.
[1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:30.960]  Everybody I know has been robbed, their car broke into, muggings, I mean, it's exploding
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:33.600]  off the charts as bad as it was in the 1980s.
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:35.680]  Judge Joe Brown, what's really going on here?
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:40.680]  Why did the left think defunding the police and setting criminals loose would be a good
[1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:41.680]  idea?
[1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:42.680]  What's their problem?
[1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:49.360]  Well, they want to deny the truth, because if the truth is out, it's a condemnation
[1:22:49.360 --> 1:22:54.320]  of their failed policies and what they have set in place in the major cities of this country
[1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:57.160]  over the last half century.
[1:22:57.160 --> 1:23:03.760]  We've taken manhood out of the equation, womanhood has been attacked, childhood as being trying
[1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:08.280]  to convert, they're trying to convert that into a recruitment ground.
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:10.320]  The schools don't teach character.
[1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:14.640]  They can't put God in the schools, but you can put something else in there where people
[1:23:14.640 --> 1:23:17.760]  just become indecent.
[1:23:17.760 --> 1:23:22.800]  We have to return back to the ways of strong people.
[1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:26.920]  And what we're seeing right now is bad.
[1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:32.040]  Right here, Memphis, we're becoming the minor murder capital of the United States.
[1:23:32.040 --> 1:23:36.360]  And one candidate in here is talking about the most important thing is to improve the
[1:23:36.360 --> 1:23:43.640]  downtown skyline and another wants to send three quarters of a billion dollars into changing
[1:23:43.640 --> 1:23:48.600]  a football arena into a soccer arena.
[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:56.280]  So and Brad's about, he took Nathan Bedford Forest statue out and got rid of it and Jeff
[1:23:56.280 --> 1:24:04.040]  Davis's statue out and meanwhile, crime sores and everybody I know including self has been
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:05.440]  victimized this year.
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:11.200]  Hell, I had one window in my car broken out and love compartment, Jimmy, because it is
[1:24:11.200 --> 1:24:17.760]  staying to have with put your pistol somewhere else other than taking it in with you to a
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:18.760]  restaurant.
[1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:25.360]  So they just go around, jump out and the chief of police even got a gun stolen from her,
[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:28.400]  which is just absolutely ridiculous.
[1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:33.000]  But you know, mine wasn't in the glove compartment.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.520]  We've got a constitutional carry state and this bunch doesn't like it.
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:43.840]  They want to de-firm the police, get rid of reasonable bonds and what are you predicting
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:46.200]  for the midterms?
[1:24:46.200 --> 1:24:49.600]  I think it's going to be a bloodletting.
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:51.680]  I'm seeing some really bad things.
[1:24:51.680 --> 1:25:00.920]  I know that even CBS did a poll and it's showing that 84% was 64% of the independence are now
[1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:03.480]  going to vote Republican.
[1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:11.720]  It's got an astonishingly high proportion of people 70, well, eight out of every 10 Americans
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:16.680]  is saying that the country is going way wrong right now.
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:22.360]  So that is that's right, 80% said the country is out of control and almost 70% blame the
[1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:23.360]  Democrats.
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:26.280]  Yeah, and that's a bad report card.
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:27.280]  Let's face it.
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:34.760]  This administration had its chance and all they've done is fail again and again and again
[1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:41.200]  and they have this clown show up in DC, the January 6th thing, which is just a showpiece
[1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:47.600]  trial and you look at it and you say, okay, what are they talking about?
[1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:49.560]  How did this thing get out?
[1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:50.560]  Where it is?
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:56.960]  And see, I was the judge on a mock trial that Fox put on and it's streaming now went
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:01.560]  on for a week and we were looking into under Biden's laptop.
[1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:09.440]  We had the individual that he left three of them with not one, but three.
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:15.960]  And the question was, is there probable cause to believe that this should be investigated
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:25.280]  for a far of violation, F-A-R-A foreign agents registration act and the jury, which was selected
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:35.120]  randomly, we had four women, two of them were black, two of them are white, two men black
[1:26:35.120 --> 1:26:39.640]  and their decision was there's probable cause.
[1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:46.720]  Somebody should look into this and it does indeed reveal a lot of criminality that the
[1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:49.560]  American public would be astonished by.
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:55.200]  But typically when somebody's trying to run a game on you, you can find a lot of hypocrisy
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:00.600]  in other words, what I do and say is okay, but what you do and say we have to suppress
[1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:09.440]  in the most important thing as a people that we have is free speech.
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:16.480]  And when you try to clamp down on free speech, you are going toward the national socialist
[1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:22.000]  workers party angle and the acronym for that was Nazi.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.160]  That's fascism, that's un-American and it's unacceptable.
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:32.720]  And in my lifetime, I've never seen anything like this, even back in the 60s when there
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:35.960]  was this great uproar over the Vietnam War.
[1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:42.760]  But right now, your freedom and liberty are at high jeopardy because there are some people
[1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:45.840]  who want to put you behind the eight balls.
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:50.840]  So you go along like sheep, it's how would you describe a judge with a little minute
[1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:51.840]  to break?
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:55.720]  I mean, this is a classical authoritarian takeover with a high tech overlay.
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:27:59.400]  Yeah, it's Orwell's Animal Farm.
[1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:04.000]  All animals are equal, but the pigs are more equal than others.
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:09.840]  And if you categorize yourself in that category of pigs, then you're supposed to be more
[1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:10.840]  equal.
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:16.480]  So if you are on that far left, we'll save you from yourself by keeping you in a crib
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:23.880]  all your life instead of letting you grow up, then while we whoopee, we have the solution
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:24.880]  for you.
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:25.880]  Wow.
[1:28:25.880 --> 1:28:27.240]  Judge Joe Brown's our guest.
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:32.560]  I've got so many questions, but what do you want to hit when we come back?
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:33.880]  Anything you want, sir.
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:36.520]  Well, I want to talk about the war on our children.
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:38.120]  I want to talk about the war in Ukraine.
[1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:43.520]  I want to talk about just what's going to happen with Biden and just everything else.
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:46.760]  I've got so many comments and then I just can't get over the admission.
[1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:51.400]  These documents, yeah, the federal government's illegally working with think tanks and private
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:53.640]  groups to spy and surveil and debank people.
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:59.160]  I mean, they're a gang of criminals.
[1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:04.400]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:05.800]  you.
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:09.720]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see
[1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:14.800]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:19.000]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[1:33:06.440 --> 1:33:16.480]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, Judge Joe Brown's our guest.
[1:33:16.480 --> 1:33:20.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:26.720]  Live from Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:32.720]  So, Judge Joe Brown said he'll go wherever I want, but let me bring this up then.
[1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:37.200]  We'll show you the background of this, Countering Foreign Propaganda Disinformation Act, Obama
[1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:43.880]  signed a law right before he left office six years ago and then here's examples of it,
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:48.520]  not just here but around the world, Canadian military saw COVID pandemic as a unique opportunity
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:54.000]  to deploy propaganda on their own population, then it shows the U.S. doing it, Germany doing
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:59.880]  it, France doing it, the biggest psychological experiment in history is running now.
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:05.000]  They admit they did it, that they worked with military side-offs.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:11.160]  Well now they come out with documents and they say, well, Homeland Security, even when
[1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:15.560]  Trump was in office, was working against him, with censorship, and then even worse since
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:22.440]  he got removed from office, and it's just such a big deal that they list.
[1:34:22.440 --> 1:34:24.720]  Don't question the Afghanistan withdrawal.
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:28.800]  Federal government involves suppressing Americans and censoring them without them knowing illegally.
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:32.280]  Or don't question these shots or lockdowns or crime or open borders.
[1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:37.560]  They list it all right here and then Democrat Party connected and funded think tanks are
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:39.560]  given surveillance power over people.
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:43.480]  This is so criminal in my view.
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:48.360]  They can claim Big Tech has a right to censor their own platform, but violate Section 230.
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:54.080]  But what is it, Judge, when you've got government and intelligence agencies secretly working
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:35:00.600]  with think tanks and NGOs and corporations and banks and others to surveil and censor
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:03.760]  and bully the American people and even take their bank accounts away?
[1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:09.200]  I mean, that sounds like what Hitler did pre-death camp to the Jews.
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:11.960]  That's exactly what happened.
[1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:18.960]  We have, you know, my comparison of this January 6th committee is what happened after the Reichstag
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:30.520]  got burned down in 1932 in Germany, and it became an excuse to put in draconian restrictions
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:37.160]  on the German people, which allowed the takeover to occur, and it backfired on everybody.
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:39.960]  We have to be vigilant against that.
[1:35:39.960 --> 1:35:46.160]  I may not agree with what you say, what you want to say, but I will defend to the end
[1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:52.600]  your right to say it, because your right to say it is also my right to say something
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:53.600]  to the contrary.
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:36:03.680]  And when you put opposing ideas against each other and you get into them deeply, the better
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:07.600]  ideas will prevail in the end.
[1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:10.400]  We call it also, by the way, consensus.
[1:36:10.400 --> 1:36:17.000]  But right now we have people with an agenda who wanted imposed at all costs, and they
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:23.600]  should be very careful with what they do, because when you do that, it's a two-edged
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:24.600]  sword.
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:25.600]  It swings both ways.
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:32.280]  One of the things I'm just absolutely tickled about is seeing what's going to happen after
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:39.520]  this election, and the midterms revealed the bloodletting that's going to get a reversal
[1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:46.920]  so we will get red rather than blue in charge, and they set the precedent by going after
[1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:53.360]  President Trump the second time with impeachment proceedings after he was no longer in office.
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:37:04.440]  Well, from what I saw on that laptop, laptops, those laptops, there would be ample precedent,
[1:37:04.440 --> 1:37:09.000]  well not ample, it's already there, but it's going to be a disaster if they decide to go
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:16.120]  after Biden for what he was up to when he was vice president.
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:28.120]  So the three grounds for impeachment and conviction are bribery, treason, and crimes in office.
[1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:32.760]  And treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution that's very strict.
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:38.520]  It dictates how many witnesses, what they have to speak to, and what the evidence has
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:39.520]  to be.
[1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:44.360]  But bribery, that's in those laptops.
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:48.040]  The crimes, certainly so.
[1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:51.080]  And what's crazy about the laptops, and I know you professionally reviewed them for
[1:37:51.080 --> 1:37:55.040]  Fox News and it's a big important point everybody should see, they're at Fox Nation and other
[1:37:55.040 --> 1:38:00.360]  places, I've seen it, but I mean, he's in there saying, I take money, I give this percent
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:04.000]  to my dad, and then we do this for the, and then I'm under the control of the Chinese
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.120]  head of intelligence, I mean, it's ridiculous that he was so arrogant he didn't even hide
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:09.120]  any of it.
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:13.400]  Well, see, there's another thing too, Fox was responsible enough.
[1:38:13.400 --> 1:38:19.160]  We were responsible enough not to even get into certain things that compromises the security,
[1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:24.880]  that compromise the security of the United States of America.
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:30.640]  Some of that, I'm not talking about Hunter Biden's porn activities that are all through
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:36.720]  there, but I'm talking about the emails and exchanges and there are even some White House
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:40.960]  tapes and how a crackhead gets his hands on White House tapes.
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:48.680]  But I don't know, but there are some really frightful things in there and listen, I started
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:54.000]  looking at it back during the election, six years ago, I guess it came out a few years
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:59.360]  before 2020, and I couldn't look at it, I told my crew, we shouldn't even look at this,
[1:38:59.360 --> 1:39:02.720]  because it's so criminal, I felt dirty even looking at it.
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:11.800]  Well, it's bad, and it's very bad, so it can come back to Biden, but...
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:15.040]  How much other did you look at, because there's so much?
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:26.400]  Where's a lot, but we didn't cover a lot, because we just focused on foreign agents registration
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:31.840]  act and whether there was any likely violation of that, but some of the other stuff came
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:38.520]  up, so we looked into it, but I don't even want to go there, because it's just not proper.
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:43.160]  I was about to say, I mean, I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:50.080]  Yeah, some drug, drug, he doesn't need to, even if he messed up, we don't need to take
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:57.880]  an opportunity to mess ourselves up any further by getting into some of what's in there, that's
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:39:59.360]  just...
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:05.120]  They need to look at that, and I think it's absolutely criminal that no one has.
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:10.840]  There should be a special prosecutor appointed on behalf of the United States outside of
[1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:16.840]  the Justice Department who gets into that seriously and does something to protect the
[1:40:16.840 --> 1:40:19.480]  interests of this country.
[1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:28.840]  We are not being protected now, we were being, and are being paid forcefully, a 1984 type
[1:40:28.840 --> 1:40:32.960]  thing that is very, very bad for the country.
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:41.140]  We are conditioning a generation of Americans to think it's all right to oppress free speech.
[1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:47.480]  We are raising a generation of Americans to think it's all right to suppress the free
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:52.120]  exchange of ideas because somebody's feelings are hurt.
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:41:00.320]  We are raising a generation that is being taught that shame is bad and guilt is bad.
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:06.800]  Shame and guilt control inappropriate human behavior, and they are good things.
[1:41:06.800 --> 1:41:10.440]  We don't want them overloaded, but we don't want them wiped out.
[1:41:10.440 --> 1:41:16.880]  We don't want someone being able to use this kind of censorship and oppression to stack
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:20.520]  the debt, and that's what people are doing.
[1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:23.840]  We're doing it down here in Memphis right now.
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:28.120]  This is like I've never seen it all the 50 years I've been in Memphis.
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:33.840]  You're talking about the mayor's election, which is more than a year away, and you still
[1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:38.840]  have an election it isn't over with right now.
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:39.840]  Give me a break.
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:41.000]  Well, they're scared of you.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:45.120]  I mean, you'd make a great, not just make a great mayor, you'd make a great governor
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:46.120]  or president.
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:48.480]  All right, thank you for that.
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:55.600]  I'm getting a little old for it, but I've got to go out with a little bit of head of
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:58.120]  trying to be righteous.
[1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:06.280]  In fact, one of our senior officials who was a woman who's always been about decency was
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:11.480]  in her 90s and still holding office and dealing with what she had to do for the interest of
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:12.480]  the people.
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:18.440]  She recruited me and set up an exploratory committee and was on my campaign committee
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:24.080]  until things happened there a couple of months ago, and she passed a couple of weeks.
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:35.000]  That's a Mrs. Barbara Cooper who has always been a strong woman who has been about advancing
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.500]  the interest of the people.
[1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:37.500]  That's what worries me.
[1:42:37.500 --> 1:42:40.720]  We're going to break your final segment, but I don't want to always just say older generations
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:42.800]  are better, but they work compared to us.
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:46.880]  So many iconic people quietly have held society together and they're dying, and that's a big
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:50.880]  problem because I'm really worried about the young people, including myself compared to
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:53.040]  a lot of my ancestors that were so good.
[1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:55.000]  We'll be right back with Judge Joe Brown.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:58.440]  Stay with us.
[1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:02.680]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny, but when you fight tyranny,
[1:43:02.680 --> 1:43:04.720]  the new world order comes after you.

[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:16.880]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people of you and

[1:43:59.240 --> 1:44:06.760]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist, I have come from nowhere to the
[1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:10.720]  very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:16.240]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:17.240]  deserve the credit.
[1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:22.160]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:24.720]  reason you've had the success.
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:29.520]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new world order we've
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:30.520]  ever had.
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:36.520]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:40.680]  important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight, and to continue
[1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:43.360]  in the efforts you've been carrying out, and to intensify them.
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:49.360]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:53.200]  now, because we are over the target and history is happening.
[1:44:53.200 --> 1:44:58.160]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:03.260]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the globalist documents, from their own admissions
[1:45:03.260 --> 1:45:04.880]  is now happening.
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:09.320]  Info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher, and it's because of your
[1:45:09.320 --> 1:45:15.400]  backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and
[1:45:15.400 --> 1:45:17.960]  the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air.
[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:24.360]  And now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together, so I want to ask all
[1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:27.960]  of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:31.800]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced
[1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:37.400]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.

[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:33.240]  There's a takeover happening in America by multinational Ruthless corporations, but
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:37.360]  if we're aware of their operations and they're surrogate operatives at every level, not
[1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:42.480]  just the WEF, but the stay behind networks that the global has set up, we can beat them.
[1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:45.600]  They've got to have the public on board or they'll fail, that's what they're trying to

[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:41.920]  Joe Brown, I'm bringing myself now into the discussion, because I wanted to get you on
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:46.880]  a few weeks ago about this, get your taken, now you're here, but there's obviously bigger
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:52.960]  issues than me, except this is their beta test, you've now seen the Texas trial.
[1:48:52.960 --> 1:49:01.680]  You are a big, let me tell you what just happened to you, previously the largest judgment ever
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:08.160]  taken in American legal history was against Exxon Valdez, that said oil tanker up in the
[1:49:08.160 --> 1:49:15.480]  Alaska, that got set aside because of some technical matter, so that didn't stand.
[1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:24.080]  The next biggest one, which until your situation was the largest judgment taken in American
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:34.160]  history was obtained by a friend of mine, Willie Gary, down in Boca Raton, Florida.
[1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:45.840]  And that was affirmed on appeal in 1984, wow, interesting year, but yours is now the biggest
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:52.320]  judgment taken against anyone in the history of the United States, and the basis for that
[1:49:52.320 --> 1:49:58.560]  is you hurt someone's feelings.
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:05.680]  And it sounds extraordinary in terms of all of the actual wrong that has been done over
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:17.200]  the years, physical harm, death, endangerment of the public, and ideas now become the most
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:18.200]  damaging thing.
[1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:24.760]  Well, OxyCotton paid, OxyCotton killed hundreds of thousands, they paid $6 billion in change,
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:30.600]  and now the plaintiff's lawyers are asking in this unfair trade practices deal for $2.75
[1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:36.400]  trillion, $2,750 billion, judge, I don't have $2 billion.
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:43.600]  Oh, I understand, it's, say there's frustration involved here and they want to punish someone,
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:54.600]  this administration and its preceding cousins in power have turned this country into an
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:51:00.000]  unsafe place, and I'm not talking about guns out on the street, it's character.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:04.640]  I mean, myself and some other individuals, I know who've been taking martial arts for
[1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:09.560]  a half century, we can kill most people with our bare hands without a weapon, so what do
[1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:10.560]  you do?
[1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:12.560]  You're going to register us?
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:13.560]  No such thing.
[1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:17.920]  So why do you think they did this, because they defaulted me lying, I gave them all the
[1:51:17.920 --> 1:51:22.080]  discovery, they showed all the discovery, twisted it, we couldn't put on defense, the
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:25.920]  judge said yes, no, I don't know answers, they had a five-week memorial service for
[1:51:25.920 --> 1:51:31.640]  the children and told the jury I was guilty, I mean, this is a lot bigger than me obviously,
[1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:35.480]  now the Democrats say they're going to do default judgments everywhere and shut everybody
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:38.920]  down, they admit this is now their authoritarian-totalitarian plan.
[1:51:38.920 --> 1:51:44.400]  Well, yes, it is, it's the same thing they did to Dr. Bill Cosby, I said, and in fact
[1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:50.160]  I told you way back when I said this isn't going to stand unappealed, somebody just
[1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:52.160]  crouched all over the Constitution.
[1:51:52.160 --> 1:51:57.080]  You did say that, you did say it, and it was a fraud, the media lied, the whole thing
[1:51:57.080 --> 1:51:59.080]  was a fraud.
[1:51:59.080 --> 1:52:07.160]  Yeah, well, I think, personally, I think you're going to have a pretty good chance on appeal
[1:52:07.160 --> 1:52:13.880]  if they apply the law and one of the things is that somebody on some of these appellate
[1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:21.440]  benches gets the idea that there is a bigger picture which is the interest of all of us
[1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:28.280]  when it comes down to being able to avail ourselves of free speech, well, this country
[1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:40.400]  can keep on its journey of something else to a beacon of democracy.
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:47.840]  Well, just like you said, surrogates, just like DHS is running the big tech, the media,
[1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:52.400]  they are now, I know, with Soros involved with these judges and involved with the exact
[1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:57.120]  same program, this is weaponization of the judiciary, how could they get judges to default
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:01.280]  me when I gave them all the evidence, there was no evidence, and then let them put the
[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:06.000]  evidence on, twist it, but not let me put on defense, they admit that.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:13.120]  Well, that's why we have appellate for somebody's looking over somebody's shoulder.
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:20.080]  One of the things that I do not like today is this thing of son, that's a year in the
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:25.120]  ninth grade, yes, I want to be a judge just like you, well, do you know what that means?
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:26.600]  What do you know about life?
[1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:28.840]  What do you know about the law?
[1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:30.160]  Are you good at it?
[1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:37.760]  Wise and experienced in the ways of the law and learned and wise and what's going on
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:38.760]  with people?
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:40.520]  Do you know anything about that?
[1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:46.720]  They don't know, don't care, and we select people for particularly some of these new
[1:53:46.720 --> 1:53:50.800]  openings on appellate benches who have never dealt with people law.
[1:53:50.800 --> 1:53:55.480]  They haven't had a client on the other side of their desk, it's a real live person and
[1:53:55.480 --> 1:54:03.400]  not representing a mega corporation or they have been confined throughout their careers
[1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:10.480]  to academia where they don't deal with reality and they don't get it, but there are still
[1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:18.960]  a few remaining and I'll say this during the last administration, fortunately, some
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:23.880]  judges got appointed to understand the bill of rights.
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:31.280]  You see, the bill of rights is what got this leftist bunch in a position to be able to
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:38.760]  speak out and be heard and now that they have been able to take advantage of that situation,
[1:54:38.760 --> 1:54:40.960]  they want to shut it down.
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:42.960]  They're pulling the ladder up.
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:50.320]  Yeah, it's all the other way, but that is a dangerous type of thing because that leads
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:51.320]  other places.
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:58.240]  Now, I had a professor back in the 60s, I was a teaching assistant for the lady, and
[1:54:58.240 --> 1:55:06.120]  she said America is in grave danger of becoming a fascist country, not for many jackboot wearing
[1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:15.640]  goof stepping uniform fascist political thugs, but as she put it from some pink panty wearing
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:25.920]  long haired beatniks who will impose the methods of fascism on the country with clean hearts
[1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:30.040]  because they think they will be protecting the country from itself.
[1:55:30.040 --> 1:55:33.000]  And that's kind of what we've got here.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:34.080]  It's not good.
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:41.160]  We are adults, we need to be raised to become effective adults, not pampered and protected
[1:55:41.160 --> 1:55:48.320]  so we never grow up and remain children the rest of our lives with somebody, big brother
[1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:56.400]  somewhere playing the parent role, frankly, their parenting stinks anyway.
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:55:59.920]  So judge Joe Brown, thank you so much for the time.
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:03.800]  I want to invite you back anytime you want to come on, sir, we love you.
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:06.440]  Judge Joe Brown TV on Twitter, judge Joe Brown show.com.
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:08.440]  Check out his amazing hot sauce.
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:11.320]  I've already had about 10 bottles of it since it came out.
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:13.720]  Find that at judge joe brown show.com.
[1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:15.640]  Judge thank you so much for the time, sir.
[1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:17.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:19.240]  Good luck on that case.
[1:56:19.240 --> 1:56:20.880]  Well, it's kind of a joke.
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:24.960]  I mean, anything above like a couple million, like I have a couple gallons of blood in me.
[1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:27.360]  So they say we want a trillion gallons or billion gallons.
[1:56:27.360 --> 1:56:28.360]  It's just kind of a joke.
[1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:33.440]  I mean, it actually, I mean, it actually turned him when they requested though 2.75 trillion
[1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:35.640]  almost everybody I know turned against him at that point.
[1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:37.880]  I mean, they actually requested that.
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:46.800]  The plaintiff's lawyers now want that you're not the United States government.
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:56.160]  The United States government would be a little hard pressed to pay that for anyone thing.
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:05.760]  So, you know, I'm really sorry for what happened to their families, but there are bigger issues.
[1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:12.560]  A lot of us have parents, a lot of us put ourselves in or our parents, our relatives
[1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:20.200]  or our ancestors or the people of this country put themselves in peril of death, mutilation
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:30.880]  and worse to get the right to have free speech or maintain it or in advance it.
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:40.120]  And some happily say, okay, let's throw it away because our things are absolutely and
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:41.720]  they misrepresent what I said.
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:42.720]  Joe Brown, thank you so much.
[1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:43.720]  Have a great week.
[1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:44.720]  We'll be right back.
[1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:45.720]  Stay with us.
[1:57:45.720 --> 1:57:54.360]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy.
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:58:00.040]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:03.680]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:07.200]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:08.200]  It's came over.
[1:58:08.200 --> 1:58:13.200]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:18.440]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:58:18.440 --> 1:58:23.760]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com,
[1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:24.760]  it changes the world.
[1:58:24.760 --> 1:58:29.680]  And that's why when you go to infowarsstore.com and get amazing products that empower you
[1:58:29.680 --> 1:58:34.360]  and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the
[1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.920]  tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[1:58:36.920 --> 1:58:43.120]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowarsstore.com.
[1:58:43.120 --> 1:58:48.400]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:54.280]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[1:58:54.280 --> 1:58:59.640]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[1:58:59.640 --> 1:59:01.720]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[1:59:01.720 --> 1:59:03.080]  That's what they want to take away.
[1:59:03.080 --> 1:59:04.560]  Your ability to speak freely.
[1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:06.280]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[1:59:06.280 --> 1:59:09.160]  Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:13.320]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[1:59:13.320 --> 1:59:14.320]  all of this.
[1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:17.640]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[1:59:17.640 --> 1:59:18.640]  your support.
[1:59:18.640 --> 1:59:21.720]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:26.240]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[1:59:26.240 --> 1:59:29.880]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[1:59:29.880 --> 1:59:31.560]  because of your past support.
[1:59:31.560 --> 1:59:35.400]  So I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you now, to critical juncture of the battle,
[1:59:35.400 --> 1:59:40.120]  free double your efforts by visiting infowarsstore.com and getting amazing products to keep us on
[1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:41.120]  air.
[1:59:41.120 --> 1:59:46.280]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is infowarsstore.com, and I thank you all for
[1:59:46.280 --> 1:59:49.760]  your support.
[1:59:49.760 --> 1:59:59.960]  Making a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:59.960 --> 2:00:07.040]  We are drugged out, we are following other people's opinions, we are controlled by the
[2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:08.040]  media.
[2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:10.160]  Today, it all changes.
[2:00:10.160 --> 2:00:15.040]  This reality has been forced upon us, it is a choice, just like what I said, slavery
[2:00:15.040 --> 2:00:16.040]  is a choice.
[2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:20.680]  This time says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[2:00:20.680 --> 2:00:24.200]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, how are we going
[2:00:24.200 --> 2:00:26.200]  to get a different result out of hate?
[2:00:26.200 --> 2:00:28.200]  Why don't we just try love?
[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:30.240]  Why don't we just try love?
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:33.960]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:38.200]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[2:00:38.200 --> 2:00:41.040]  Steve Jobs crazy, now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[2:00:41.040 --> 2:00:45.520]  They say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love.
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:51.240]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:54.840]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[2:00:54.840 --> 2:00:57.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:03.600]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, US resistance against
[2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:08.360]  a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:11.320]  that set up Communist China in 1949.
[2:01:11.320 --> 2:01:15.640]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of US telecommunications infrastructure.
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:17.800]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:20.200]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[2:01:20.200 --> 2:01:21.200]  This is all confirmed.
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:22.400]  This is not a drill.
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:26.280]  Big Tech and Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:28.160]  They've officially become state run.
[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:29.160]  Apple 100%.
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:35.120]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:39.360]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones
[2:01:39.360 --> 2:01:40.360]  to do that.
[2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:41.360]  This is happening.
[2:01:41.360 --> 2:01:44.960]  This is not like the other probes before that we're meant to get you used to probes and
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:49.560]  censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it now.
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:54.520]  This attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous
[2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:55.520]  attacks.
[2:01:55.520 --> 2:02:01.080]  This is a tight-trained dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:03.360]  subversion paradigm manipulation.
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:08.080]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:11.600]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:17.480]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:22.160]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:26.240]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control
[2:02:26.240 --> 2:02:27.240]  system.
[2:02:27.240 --> 2:02:32.400]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traders
[2:02:32.400 --> 2:02:37.160]  inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program and attempting
[2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:42.160]  to stop us from removing the tentacles of the chai-coms-slash-big-tech-making-combine-emergency
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:43.160]  situation.
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:46.480]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:49.360]  battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:54.600]  They want to double-use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[2:02:54.600 --> 2:02:58.120]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:02.680]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw
[2:03:02.680 --> 2:03:03.680]  man.
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:07.080]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:08.080]  me a herder of children.
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:12.680]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually
[2:03:12.680 --> 2:03:16.080]  censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:21.960]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:23.840]  by being the main distraction.
[2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:28.480]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being
[2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:29.480]  used against you.
[2:03:29.480 --> 2:03:34.080]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[2:03:34.080 --> 2:03:36.080]  I have given you the transmission.
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:38.080]  You can now break free.
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:48.080]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[2:03:48.080 --> 2:03:50.080]  the mind of man.
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:04:02.440]  Thomas Jefferson, if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:10.440]  The year is 1995 and Infowars launches the last of America's counterglobalist probes.
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:16.880]  In a freak mishap, Infowars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an
[2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:25.200]  orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:30.040]  Transdimensionally over the space time continuum is a full space where people are extremely
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:33.240]  lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:37.960]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now real.

[2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:14.600]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:21.880]  Well I've been wanting to get Judge Andrew Napolitano on in the last week and I'm glad
[2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:26.720]  that today's the day you can come on because it broke yesterday and so much of this has
[2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:32.480]  already come out but now we've got not just the skeleton but the full body and the full
[2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:34.880]  blueprint of this.
[2:06:34.880 --> 2:06:39.160]  Going back under George W. Bush they set up Homeland Security and InfraGuard and Infrastructure
[2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:43.200]  Protection putting spies in all the industry to look for radical Muslims under the Patriot
[2:06:43.200 --> 2:06:48.920]  Act and we always said and Judge Andrew Napolitano at the time on Fox News 22 years ago said
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:53.840]  mark my words, I know I put him in my documentaries, he said this will be used against the American
[2:06:53.840 --> 2:06:55.800]  people.
[2:06:55.800 --> 2:07:02.040]  Well yesterday the Intercept released all these documents that are confirmed to be real
[2:07:02.040 --> 2:07:06.560]  where during Trump's administration there were stay-behind groups set up by Obama which
[2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:11.800]  we have articles from six years ago where he set them up but now we know the details.
[2:07:11.800 --> 2:07:14.560]  Coordinating to undermine Trump and remove him from office and then they manipulated
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:19.880]  the 2020 election to not criticize anything that was going on.
[2:07:19.880 --> 2:07:25.920]  Not just calling up Facebook and saying don't have the Hunter Biden laptop as on Joe Rogan
[2:07:25.920 --> 2:07:31.280]  show over a month ago, Mark Zuckerberg admitted but controlling, questioning lockdowns, open
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:33.960]  borders, election fraud, all of it.
[2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:37.120]  So this isn't just big tech censoring, this is Homeland Security doing it and Homeland
[2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:41.000]  Security I'll show you the documents of Judge Napolitano in a moment.
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:47.400]  They say because the government isn't supposed to be involved in censorship and propaganda
[2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:53.280]  we're going to use trusted leftist NGOs, ADL, Southern Primary Law Center that will give
[2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:59.080]  orders to that are our agents, this is an intelligence operation, to then go in with
[2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:04.040]  big tech and interface and also dinosaur media, they say respected trusted media, New
[2:08:04.040 --> 2:08:05.560]  York Times, Washington Post.
[2:08:05.560 --> 2:08:10.560]  So they're not just censoring you and ordering who censored, they're spying on you including
[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:12.200]  your private messages.
[2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:17.600]  It's the CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee.
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:22.680]  It's all over the news today, they're trying to desperately spin it and here they are in
[2:08:22.680 --> 2:08:26.720]  the documents talking about we have to have a clearinghouse that's a fence so there's
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:30.240]  no appearance of government involvement or propaganda.
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:34.960]  This is the Rosetta Stone of what they've done, Tim Poole says this may be the biggest
[2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:35.960]  story of our lives.
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:39.960]  Oh, this makes Richard Nixon thinking about spying look like an angel.
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:48.080]  They've got battle points, everything, this is unbelievable, it's a secret agency, disinformation
[2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:55.120]  governance board with billions of dollars put in place by Obama before he left office.
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:08:56.960]  This is incredible.
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:03.400]  I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a famous judge, I just study these things and this looks completely
[2:09:03.400 --> 2:09:10.640]  like the Godzilla of tyranny and totally illegal, Judge Andrew DePaulitano, what in the world?
[2:09:10.640 --> 2:09:14.640]  I mean, we're learning more and more every day, this is insane.
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:21.960]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be with you, you've been on my mind with all you've been going
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:24.680]  through in the past couple of weeks.
[2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:30.320]  I have talked about you on my podcast, I wrote a piece called Alex Jones and the Freedom
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:37.160]  of Speech, which thanks be to God, got tremendous coverage and made a very plain and basic free
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:40.720]  speech argument before you in your behalf.
[2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:45.720]  I guess we can talk about your own situation at a later time because the issue that you
[2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:50.920]  raise now doesn't affect just Alex Jones, where the state of Connecticut changed its
[2:09:50.920 --> 2:09:55.000]  laws retroactively to censor and punish you.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.200]  Oh yes, sir, I wanted to get you on about my case that affects everybody as well.
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:05.560]  And I just, this is breaking and it's perfect timing, I mean, am I overestimating how bad
[2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:06.560]  this is?
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:11.040]  No, no, you're not because this is a government trick.
[2:10:11.040 --> 2:10:16.040]  Now this goes back to George W. Bush, who of course brought us to the Department of
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:25.640]  Homeland Security, which is basically 60,000 federal cops, there are only 8,000 FBI agents,
[2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:32.320]  but we have 60,000 federal cops in the Department of Homeland Security, they don't direct
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:38.240]  traffic, you don't really see them, they do the types of things that you are quite properly
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:42.880]  and quite courageously warning your audience and the American people about.
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:48.960]  So when the Department of Homeland Security or any government engages a private entity
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:55.320]  to do the government's bidding, so it looks like it's the private entity, it looks like
[2:10:55.320 --> 2:11:01.280]  Facebook is censoring you, but they're really doing it because the government hates you,
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:07.480]  then the private entity is engaged in what the courts call state action, which basically
[2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:12.640]  means the private entity and the government, I'm putting my fingers together, become so
[2:11:12.640 --> 2:11:20.400]  intertwined with each other that the limitations that the Bill of Rights imposes on the government
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:27.280]  will be imposed on the private entity, stated differently, if Facebook or Google or Twitter
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:34.000]  or any of them are censoring as a favor to the federal government, then the Bill of Rights
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:42.240]  will be applied to Facebook or Google or Twitter and they won't be able to do this on the basis
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:48.040]  of content and they can be sued for doing it just as the federal government could be
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:52.600]  sued if it's censored you or me on the basis of content.
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:59.280]  So they were a little too cute, they thought, the feds that is, they could hide behind Facebook,
[2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:04.560]  but because these documents have been revealed, it is now obvious what they were doing, it
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:11.400]  is clear what the law is and Facebook and Google and Twitter and whoever else is doing
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:19.120]  this will be exposed to mammoth liability by becoming spies and censors in behalf of
[2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:22.120]  the feds.
[2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:26.720]  And not just in US history, but in history, where are the parallels, because this technology
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:31.880]  didn't exist before, I mean, this is, you said mammoth, it's gargantuan, it's just total
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:38.920]  admission, you're the expert, you're the lawyer, you're the judge, how illegal is this?
[2:12:38.920 --> 2:12:46.060]  Well it is profoundly illegal, A, because it has a private entity standing in the place
[2:12:46.060 --> 2:12:49.640]  of the government and the Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from doing this.
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:58.080]  So when Edward Snowden, for example, revealed that the NSA was spying on everyone, he revealed
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:06.160]  what was up to that time the most massive federal violation of constitutional liberties
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:13.120]  in the post-Civil War era, again instituted by George W. Bush, which was capturing every
[2:13:13.120 --> 2:13:18.120]  keystroke on every desktop and every mobile device in the United States.
[2:13:18.120 --> 2:13:22.080]  The total information awareness network that you first exposed.
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:23.080]  Correct.
[2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:28.040]  And when you and I talked about this, we were ridiculed, we were ridiculed by the mainstream
[2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:34.240]  media, we were ridiculed by my colleagues at Fox, we were ridiculed by the government,
[2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:38.440]  we were ridiculed by a lot of people who said we were extremists, we were alarmists, we
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:43.280]  weren't, we were stating the facts and it has taken 22 years for the American public
[2:13:43.280 --> 2:13:48.720]  to come around to an understanding of the fact that our warnings were correct.
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:55.040]  All of this started with the give Bush whatever he wants attitude that occurred right after
[2:13:55.040 --> 2:14:00.120]  9-11, when they enacted the Patriot Act with 15 minutes of debate on the floor of the House
[2:14:00.120 --> 2:14:06.440]  of Representatives and next to no debate on the floor of the Senate and it eviscerated
[2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:12.520]  the Fourth Amendment by allowing one FBI agent to give another FBI agent a search warrant.
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:17.680]  Even though the Constitution says only judges can do that on the basis of a probable cause.
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:25.960]  All of that led in varying steps to the Department of Homeland Security, to more massive spying,
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:30.560]  to a doubling and troubling of the amount of agents that work for the NSA.
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:38.760]  So there's now, it's the same number as the DHS, 60,000 American spies, this is not the
[2:14:38.760 --> 2:14:46.080]  same 60,000 that work for DHS, this is another 60,000 who work for NSA and all they do is
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:47.320]  spy on America.
[2:14:47.320 --> 2:14:50.920]  So this is getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[2:14:50.920 --> 2:14:59.240]  But what was revealed yesterday was far more duplicitous than what even Bush was doing.
[2:14:59.240 --> 2:15:06.080]  Bush was having and Obama before this was having the government directly interfere with
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:08.560]  your constitutional liberties.
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:15.080]  What is we would now know has happened under Obama and Biden is the federal government
[2:15:15.080 --> 2:15:24.560]  hiding behind big tech and pretending it is big tech that is censoring us when in reality
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:28.400]  it is big tech doing what the federal government wants.
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:32.440]  Now why would big tech do this for the federal government?
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:39.200]  Great question, easy answer because there's a statute that immunizes big tech from being
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:42.880]  sued for the consequences of what big tech posts.
[2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:45.680]  So the statute says, Facebook is a bull.
[2:15:45.680 --> 2:15:50.000]  Oh, stay there and explain this but it's simple, they're indemnified, now the federal government
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:59.960]  gets indemnified from surveillance, unbelievable racketeering, we'll be right back.

[2:19:58.480 --> 2:20:24.880]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:24.880 --> 2:20:31.320]  Remember James Clapper, now about seven, eight years ago, former head of the NSA saying,
[2:20:31.320 --> 2:20:39.920]  we've never spied on a single American citizen, total lie came out their spine on everybody.
[2:20:39.920 --> 2:20:48.560]  But imagine the controversy now with DHS, with NSA like powers through big tech and
[2:20:48.560 --> 2:20:56.480]  the banks and the universities and NGOs farming out government orders on who they want censored,
[2:20:56.480 --> 2:20:57.480]  who they shut down.
[2:20:57.480 --> 2:21:00.040]  That's why Zuckerberg a month ago on Joe Rogan is getting ahead of this.
[2:21:00.040 --> 2:21:01.040]  He knows it's coming out.
[2:21:01.040 --> 2:21:04.600]  He's like, yeah, the FBI told me don't cover Hunter Biden.
[2:21:04.600 --> 2:21:08.440]  It was rushing this info and you read this, it's total election meddling.
[2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:11.400]  They admit it's about the elections.
[2:21:11.400 --> 2:21:15.520]  So Trump got in for four years, but he wasn't really in because these bureaucracies were
[2:21:15.520 --> 2:21:16.600]  still operating.
[2:21:16.600 --> 2:21:20.560]  So it was really bad under Obama, Trump gets in, they're still operating under cover and
[2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:21.560]  they're now under Biden.
[2:21:21.560 --> 2:21:23.560]  It just spikes.
[2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:27.600]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, one of the top brains when it comes to constitutions here, you should
[2:21:27.600 --> 2:21:33.160]  definitely check him out on Twitter at JudgeNap and on the website JudgeNap.com and his amazing
[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:36.800]  podcast and shows that I watch on a routine basis at least twice a week.
[2:21:36.800 --> 2:21:41.800]  And I did see your big defense of me in laying out the law, which we'll do later in the hour.
[2:21:41.800 --> 2:21:46.360]  But obviously this is even bigger than the weaponization of the judiciary.
[2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:50.680]  You got cut off by the break judge, Napolitano, when you were getting into why the federal
[2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:53.800]  government wanted to use these cutouts of private industry.
[2:21:53.800 --> 2:21:59.560]  Well, the real question is why would private industry cooperate with the federal government?
[2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:04.560]  Because the feds have enacted a statute that declares that big tech is really a bulletin
[2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:05.560]  board.
[2:22:05.560 --> 2:22:11.920]  So the view Facebook as a bulletin board, some crazy person could post some harmful information
[2:22:11.920 --> 2:22:17.160]  there or some private information and an innocent individual harmed by it.
[2:22:17.160 --> 2:22:19.840]  That innocent individual cannot sue Facebook.
[2:22:19.840 --> 2:22:24.800]  It can only sue the person who posted it who may not be somebody you can find or may not
[2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:26.160]  be somebody with any assets.
[2:22:26.160 --> 2:22:28.440]  So that's section 230.
[2:22:28.440 --> 2:22:29.720]  Correct.
[2:22:29.720 --> 2:22:35.800]  So section 230 of the Federal Communications Act, which regulates this stuff, gives Facebook
[2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:43.640]  and the others absolute immunity for the consequences of what's posted there.
[2:22:43.640 --> 2:22:48.800]  So probably during these negotiations, the feds have said, you like that immunity, right?
[2:22:48.800 --> 2:22:49.800]  Sure.
[2:22:49.800 --> 2:22:50.800]  Of course we do.
[2:22:50.800 --> 2:22:51.800]  It saves us a fortune.
[2:22:51.800 --> 2:22:52.800]  Okay.
[2:22:52.800 --> 2:22:53.800]  You want to keep that immunity?
[2:22:53.800 --> 2:22:55.480]  You're now working for us.
[2:22:55.480 --> 2:23:00.720]  And if you don't work for us, there's a lot of Republicans and even many Democrats who
[2:23:00.720 --> 2:23:03.000]  want to get rid of that immunity.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:09.200]  That will force you to buy very expensive liability insurance, which will force you to start charging
[2:23:09.200 --> 2:23:14.000]  people for using Facebook and Twitter and Google and all the others.
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:15.920]  I'm not particularly picking on Facebook.
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:17.760]  I'm just using it as an example.
[2:23:17.760 --> 2:23:24.080]  There are many of high-tech businesses that we use and take for granted that we don't
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:30.000]  pay directly for using that are protected by this section of the federal law.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.760]  Do I know that this threat occurred?
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:33.760]  Of course not.
[2:23:33.760 --> 2:23:35.320]  I wasn't in on those conversations.
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:36.800]  You and I are not the type of people.
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:41.720]  Now that we saw the Democrats on air saying, if you don't censor more, we'll strip 230.
[2:23:41.720 --> 2:23:43.200]  They said that.
[2:23:43.200 --> 2:23:44.200]  Correct.
[2:23:44.200 --> 2:23:45.200]  Correct.
[2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:48.080]  So the Democrats are on the other side of this.
[2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:54.480]  The Democrats are threatening to strip the immunity that's granted to big tech.
[2:23:54.480 --> 2:24:02.200]  If big tech fails to censor, the Biden administration is saying to them, we're censoring, but we're
[2:24:02.200 --> 2:24:04.920]  going to pretend it's you.
[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:09.600]  And if you don't go along with this pretense, we will strip this immunity.
[2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:12.800]  So you have pressure coming from both sides.
[2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:18.120]  Republicans hate big tech because they believe that there should be some censorship and they
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:21.680]  don't like that Trump was censored and others weren't.
[2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:24.640]  So you have massive pressure from the federal government.
[2:24:24.640 --> 2:24:25.640]  You said the key.
[2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:29.880]  That's going to allow this all is the Republican establishment, including who I like.
[2:24:29.880 --> 2:24:34.400]  He's bad on this, Clarence Thomas, they see the horrible excesses of media and say, OK,
[2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:37.240]  let's do some censorship, but it's going to be selective.
[2:24:37.240 --> 2:24:42.360]  Well, you know, it's it's wrong.
[2:24:42.360 --> 2:24:44.480]  I'm holding up my iPhone.
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:45.960]  What's in here?
[2:24:45.960 --> 2:24:53.960]  Financial, medical, legal, personal, professional banking, almost everything you can think of
[2:24:53.960 --> 2:25:01.480]  when when Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh, and he asked me what I thought he said he
[2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:02.760]  doesn't believe in the Fourth Amendment.
[2:25:02.760 --> 2:25:03.760]  So what are you talking about?
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:07.800]  I said, well, here's this opinion, Mr. President, if you want to have one of your people read
[2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:14.760]  it in Kavanaugh's opinion, you don't need a warrant to get into an iPhone.
[2:25:14.760 --> 2:25:16.520]  The government can just go in there.
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:21.720]  Even though it's the most personal papers there are, it is literally like a colonoscopy.
[2:25:21.720 --> 2:25:24.960]  I mean, correct, correct.
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:31.920]  So you have so called conservative Republicans on the court appointed by conservative Republicans
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:37.640]  agreeing with liberal Democrats appointed by liberal Democrats that the Fourth Amendment
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:46.600]  is meaningless when the federal government claims its favorite claim, national security.
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:52.040]  Yesterday, when the Supreme Court oral argument over affirmative action, one of the justices
[2:25:52.040 --> 2:25:57.200]  said, well, why does West Point get to use racial quotas and Harvard can't?
[2:25:57.200 --> 2:26:00.840]  And the lawyer for the federal government said national security in the court left
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:03.120]  and has nothing to do with national security.
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:08.240]  But the government will always claim its national security and in their minds and regrettably
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:14.240]  even in the court's minds that Trump's the personal right to privacy, which is supposed
[2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:16.540]  to be protected by the Fourth Amendment.
[2:26:16.540 --> 2:26:24.400]  So the bottom line here is the government is spying on us, but it's hiding behind Big
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:30.480]  Tech so that we won't know it because Big Tech is a private entity that can censor whoever
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:31.480]  it wants.
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:36.160]  But when Big Tech does the government's bidding, then the Fourth Amendment is applied to Big
[2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:41.360]  Tech and they can be sued for what they do and exposed for what they've done.
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:46.200]  So is this not election meddling, illegal spying, government closure of private corporations,
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:48.200]  the mother of all civil rights violations?
[2:26:48.200 --> 2:26:49.200]  How bad is this?
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:50.760]  Is this not the worst thing I've ever seen?
[2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:52.360]  And where should we go from here?
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:59.040]  Well, it is probably worse than what Snowden revealed because it's all being done behind
[2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:02.200]  the shield of private enterprise.
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:07.160]  I mean, this is the worst form of, I'm going to use a word you're not supposed to use,
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:09.720]  fascism that the United States has seen.
[2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:14.440]  So the definition of fascism is private ownership, but government control.
[2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:15.440]  Exactly.
[2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:20.280]  Which is exactly what we have, I mean, Facebook is owned by its shareholders, but the government
[2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:22.240]  uses fascists, but Judge, you're right.
[2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:24.960]  This is the definition of fascism.
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:25.960]  Yes.
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:28.480]  Yes, it literally is.
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:32.280]  Facebook is owned by its shareholders, but the government is controlling it.
[2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:39.280]  And the same with any other Big Tech that the government is using to hide behind.
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:45.280]  So this began under Bush, was done below the radar under Trump because he never would
[2:27:45.280 --> 2:27:52.720]  have gone along with it, but it happened on his watch, sorry, began under Bush, exacerbated
[2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:58.680]  under Obama, below the radar under Trump, exacerbated now, again, under Biden.
[2:27:58.680 --> 2:28:02.840]  This stuff that came out yesterday, these are Biden-era documents.
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:10.560]  So they're less than 18 months old, are simply reprehensible and they are a nightmare and
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:15.600]  they are what you and I and our colleagues predicted 22 years ago.
[2:28:15.600 --> 2:28:19.160]  Well you are completely vindicated because I learned much of this from you watching you
[2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:23.240]  and you said all this, you said it'll be used against citizens, you watch, you said in a
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:29.040]  few years and now here we are when we come back, let's shift gears into my show trial.
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:30.040]  You're an expert.
[2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:31.040]  I'd love to hear your view on it.
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:36.080]  I know you've been propounding on it and then I want to get into midterms, the war, whatever
[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:39.840]  Judge Andrew Napolitano wants to cover and folks, if you don't watch this podcast, you're
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:46.600]  crazy, find all the details on his website right now and on Twitter at Judge Nap and

[2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:18.600]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[2:32:31.040 --> 2:32:37.480]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important
[2:32:37.480 --> 2:32:41.440]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:44.280]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[2:32:44.280 --> 2:32:45.280]  God bless you all.
[2:32:45.280 --> 2:32:46.280]  I salute you.
[2:32:46.280 --> 2:32:47.280]  I thank you.
[2:32:47.280 --> 2:32:52.280]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[2:32:52.280 --> 2:32:56.440]  streak is happening, the fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight.
[2:32:56.440 --> 2:32:59.280]  God bless you all.
[2:32:59.280 --> 2:33:26.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:26.280 --> 2:33:33.840]  We are bringing the evil, the authoritarianism out in the open and Judge Andrew Napolitano
[2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:34.840]  is our guest.
[2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:41.720]  So, Judge, I could ask a thousand questions about the midterms, my show trials, where
[2:33:41.720 --> 2:33:50.200]  this country is going, the situation in Ukraine, just all of it, the red wavley sea.
[2:33:50.200 --> 2:33:55.600]  What do you think is the most important front and center that I haven't talked about?
[2:33:55.600 --> 2:34:02.560]  I think the efforts to silence you and others is the most important thing.
[2:34:02.560 --> 2:34:09.520]  I mean, this judicial demonization of you, this Orwellian declaration that your opinions
[2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:16.000]  on matters of public interest were non-opinions because they didn't like what the opinion
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:17.000]  was.
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  Okay, so I'm going to shut up.
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:20.960]  I'm going to shut up because I watched your show and you did a good 20 minutes on this
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:21.960]  later on.
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:23.680]  So I'm going to try to be quiet until the break.
[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:29.880]  So you got the floor, as a judge, as a famous commentator, as a respected legal analyst,
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:32.360]  what did you make of these trials?
[2:34:32.360 --> 2:34:39.400]  Well, the trials that occurred in Connecticut were at the hand, you were at the hands of
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:46.080]  a judiciary which hated you and hated your message and was determined to find a way to
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:47.080]  silence you.
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:52.760]  The judges and justices in Connecticut are popularly elected and so there was obviously
[2:34:52.760 --> 2:35:01.480]  a wave of sympathy amongst the public for the parents of the victims of Sandy Hook and
[2:35:01.480 --> 2:35:06.520]  because you resisted that, you became public enemy number one.
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:12.320]  But in reality, all you were doing was expressing your opinion on a matter of public interest.
[2:35:12.320 --> 2:35:19.640]  The matter of public interest was the killing of children in a school by another young person
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:24.320]  who took a rifle that was lawfully owned by his parents, so you have the right to keep
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:30.200]  them bare arms, you have school safety, you have mental health, you have freedom of speech.
[2:35:30.200 --> 2:35:33.960]  These are all matters of material public interest.
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:37.800]  In matters of material public interest, now you're not expressing an opinion on the color
[2:35:37.800 --> 2:35:43.480]  of my shirt, that's not a public interest, you're expressing an opinion on the most critical
[2:35:43.480 --> 2:35:50.280]  ideas of our day, public safety, freedom of speech, right to keep them bare arms.
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:56.400]  You can express any opinion you want as long as you give any reasons for the opinion.
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:01.360]  Your reasons can be wrong, your reasons can be bizarre, your opinion can be bizarre.
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:06.640]  But because it's an opinion and because it's on matters of public interest, it's absolutely
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:09.160]  protected by the Supreme Court.
[2:36:09.160 --> 2:36:14.920]  You had a great lawyer whom I interviewed at length and who pointed me to the documents
[2:36:14.920 --> 2:36:19.560]  in the case, which of course I read before I wrote my piece, Alex Jones and the Freedom
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:20.560]  of Speech.
[2:36:20.560 --> 2:36:28.720]  Norm Pattis is absolutely and utterly fearless and totally and completely devoted to the protection
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:36.120]  of our civil liberties, but he was not permitted to make the arguments that needed to be made
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:43.880]  because the judge simply decided, just like George Orwell in 1984 predicted that Alex
[2:36:43.880 --> 2:36:48.480]  Jones's opinions were really non-opinions and because they were non-opinions, they're
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:49.960]  not protected.
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:55.360]  So the Supreme Court has said this in a unanimous opinion in 1969, you know this case, Norm
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:37:01.760]  Pattis knows the case, the judge in Connecticut avoided the case, called Brandenburg versus
[2:37:01.760 --> 2:37:02.760]  Ohio.
[2:37:02.760 --> 2:37:11.160]  In Brandenburg versus Ohio, Mr. Brandenburg, a Ku Klux Klan leader, suggested that Jews
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:16.960]  and blacks, and he used derogatory terms to refer to them, had taken over Washington
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:19.440]  and should be taken out.
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:24.560]  And we should march from Hamilton County, Ohio to Washington, D.C. to take them out.
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:32.160]  He was convicted of criminal syndicalism, basically encouraging people to commit a crime
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:33.720]  in public.
[2:37:33.720 --> 2:37:39.320]  That conviction was upheld by an Ohio appellate court, upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court, reversed
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:47.120]  unanimously by the U.S. Supreme Court saying the speech is protected, and the rule is this,
[2:37:47.120 --> 2:37:54.800]  all innocuous speech is absolutely protected, and all speech is innocuous when there is
[2:37:54.800 --> 2:37:59.080]  time or more speech to challenge it.
[2:37:59.080 --> 2:38:06.000]  So if the parents of these children did not like what you said, they had the opportunity,
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:12.920]  and they took that opportunity to go on television and challenge you, that's the remedy for speech
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:15.040]  that they find offensive.
[2:38:15.040 --> 2:38:19.400]  There is no right in America not to be offended.
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:21.280]  You're an American, you have free speech.
[2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:24.080]  With free speech comes offense when you hear it.
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:28.040]  You don't like what people say, put your hands over your ears.
[2:38:28.040 --> 2:38:30.360]  There's no right not to be offended.
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:34.680]  But there's a right to say whatever you want about matters of public interest, and there's
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:39.760]  a right to challenge what people say about matters of public interest.
[2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:45.760]  There is no right for a judge to deny you, Alex Jones, and I'm not saying this because
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:47.480]  you're my friend.
[2:38:47.480 --> 2:38:49.360]  I'm saying it because you're a human being.
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:51.840]  These rights are personal to your humanity.
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:54.280]  To deny you your right in court.
[2:38:54.280 --> 2:39:01.760]  The public needs to know there was never a trial on whether or not you defamed anyone.
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:09.240]  The courts denied you that right because a judge decided that your opinions in her mind
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:15.080]  were so off the wall that they were non-opinions, and there's no basis for the courts to do
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:16.080]  that.
[2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:20.280]  And then the Connecticut Supreme Court, by a vote of seven to nothing and a very, very
[2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:26.120]  short opinion, which was just conclusory, it wasn't analytical, upheld what this judge
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:27.120]  did.
[2:39:27.120 --> 2:39:33.600]  I believe, and your very fine lawyer, Norm Patis, believes that the Supreme Court of
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:40.040]  the United States will reverse what happened to you in Austin and what happened to you
[2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:41.040]  in Connecticut.
[2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:47.120]  For all of the faults of this present Supreme Court, the John Robert Supreme Court has been
[2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:53.160]  superb on free speech, and once this case gets there, and it's got a bunch of steps
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:59.560]  to go before it gets there, Alex, but once it gets there, you will be vindicated, and
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:05.760]  the Alex Jones case, which now stands for suppressing free speech, will be one of the
[2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:12.080]  great cases of all time that law students will study, and lawyers and judges will rely
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:16.320]  on as the great protection of free speech.
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:20.760]  Unless the authoritarians are able to set as a precedent and erase our entire country,
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:25.320]  and I was going to be clear, they took stuff out of context, barely ever covered it, misrepresented
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:30.920]  it, said I was the first to say it, all of this had PR firms involved, but look at the
[2:40:30.920 --> 2:40:38.040]  Westboro Baptist Church, horribly disgusting people, that's my view, that's my right, going
[2:40:38.040 --> 2:40:43.120]  out to military funerals and screaming at people, because gay people exist, it's their
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:45.640]  fault that their son or daughter died.
[2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:50.480]  I hate that, I disagree with it, but the Supreme Court said they have a right to do it, as
[2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:54.440]  long as they're not on the property in their face, so as long as they're not trespassing,
[2:40:54.440 --> 2:40:59.280]  so that's the Supreme Court saying you can do that, well then how can I then not question
[2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:03.880]  something, because the internet was questioning it, it's just insane, and people say, will
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:07.120]  you please stop covering it, I barely ever covered it, the Democrats looked at my whole
[2:41:07.120 --> 2:41:14.960]  history, chose that, blew it up, and then made me the Sandy Hook man, and I'm just flabbergasted,
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:21.120]  now their demands of $2.75 trillion, $2,750 billion.
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:32.400]  Wow, look Alex, you are, you have the biggest megaphone in the world, bigger megaphone than
[2:41:32.400 --> 2:41:40.080]  the networks, you are the government's most effective and articulate and fearless critic,
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:46.720]  and they did their best to silence you now, they won't succeed in silencing you, A, because
[2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:52.160]  even if this case is not overturned, you are inside of the legal protections, which will
[2:41:52.160 --> 2:41:59.240]  allow you to continue to express the freedom of speech, but B, this case will be overturned,
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:04.000]  because it is profoundly un-American, and it was written by judges and justices who
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:08.640]  were pandering to the public because it's an elected system, and they were afraid of
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:13.080]  their own shadows, the federal system, hard to believe you and I have been such critics
[2:42:13.080 --> 2:42:19.280]  of federal government, but the federal system where the judges are life-tenured will vindicate
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:25.840]  your natural human right to speak freely, which is utterly and totally protected by the First
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:30.720]  Amendment when it comes to matters of public interest, again, we're not talking about private
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:36.320]  matters, we're talking about matters of public interest, when you're right to speak, and
[2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:39.200]  that's the federal system, it doesn't mean we're only for the federal government, it
[2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:42.240]  means there's a division of power, someone to get out of control, and I've experienced
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:46.600]  that state courts on average are worse than the feds, if you can believe that, that will
[2:42:46.600 --> 2:42:54.000]  elaborate on that, when we come back with Judge Andrew DePaulitano, please say what
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:43:01.880]  it's our best seller, we first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate
[2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:06.920]  seller, but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made it
[2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:11.440]  feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller,
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:15.640]  and it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock, vitamin mineral fusion

[2:43:25.760 --> 2:43:31.160]  that you need to live and be healthy, essential means without these things you die, and so
[2:43:31.160 --> 2:43:35.760]  much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:40.160]  to bolster our bodies defenses with a product like this, now there are other great vitamin
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:44.800]  mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it

[2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:09.800]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:09.800 --> 2:47:37.320]  I always tell people what I really think, I've been right, I'd say 95% off, but I always
[2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:40.600]  tell people what I really think, I've been right, I'd say 95% of the time, I've been
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:44.640]  wrong 5% of the time, or they take some out of context and twist it, and you know, all
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:50.320]  sphere and love and war, but I want listeners to know, as negative as the things we are
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:55.800]  that we cover, we're winning, humanity's waking up, we're seeing evidence everywhere
[2:47:55.800 --> 2:48:01.080]  and it only gets worse if we lay down, so why not stand up and speak up and not submit,
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:04.640]  and I use the example of having a cracked tooth, your body's telling you there's pain,
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:06.680]  not because you're giving up, it's telling you to do something, so you go to the dentist
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:10.040]  and get it fixed, or in the old days you'd pull it out or whatever, have a witch doctor
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:15.000]  do it, but the point is, is that things don't get better rolling over and denying these
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:19.120]  problems, and the good news is we see a huge red wave coming in, we see big awakenings
[2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:24.480]  happening, the power structure is scared, and that's why they're coming in with billion
[2:48:24.480 --> 2:48:30.120]  dollar verdicts, and 2.75 trillion request is to intimidate people like the Wizard of
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:35.600]  Oz behind the curtain, that's how I see it, so I'm actually optimistic in many ways but
[2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:40.640]  also very negative in other ways, but people shouldn't see covering negativity as being
[2:48:40.640 --> 2:48:46.160]  negative, it's believing in you and betting on humanity that if we know there's a problem,
[2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:48.920]  we're going to deal with it, that's why there's the internet saying that's so popular, I
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:55.160]  quote every day, if the situation was hopeless, the propaganda would not be necessary, if
[2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:58.240]  the situation was hopeless, they wouldn't be trying to censor us, it's because we do
[2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:03.920]  have power, can you speak, Judge Andrew de Paul, just to your overall gravitas and worldview
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:06.160]  about where humanity is today?
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:11.280]  Well, sure, Alex, to follow up on your saying, if you weren't effective, they wouldn't have
[2:49:11.280 --> 2:49:19.560]  come after you, and if they can do this to you, who has the largest audience in the country,
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:23.920]  bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country, then they can do
[2:49:23.920 --> 2:49:31.320]  this to anybody, that's why the demonization of Alex Jones, the destruction of your due
[2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:37.360]  process rights as well as your First Amendment liberties, should be a profound interest to
[2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:40.000]  everybody all across the board, even progressives.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  I think Norm Patis might be a progressive, I don't know, even progressives should agree
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:52.800]  with this, the left should agree with this, only totalitarians will rejoice in the demonization
[2:49:52.800 --> 2:49:57.600]  of somebody with whose speech they disagree.
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:02.640]  If they weren't fearful of you, they wouldn't be coming after you, you know, Thomas Jefferson
[2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:06.920]  once said, when the people fear the government, there is tyranny, but when the government
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:14.600]  fears the people, there is liberty, the government fears Alex Jones, and people who speak like
[2:50:14.600 --> 2:50:20.240]  him, and they will go after those people, because the thing, the government fears more
[2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:22.160]  than anything else is losing its power.
[2:50:22.160 --> 2:50:25.860]  Well, let's try to judge, let's bring you into this, because I know some of the inside
[2:50:25.860 --> 2:50:29.480]  baseball that all of it came out of the news, you were targeted for over a decade for removal
[2:50:29.480 --> 2:50:34.240]  at Fox, all sorts of threats behind the scenes, they also want Tucker now, so people need
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:39.600]  to know, folks that tell the truth, even on Fox, are paying a high price.
[2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:45.760]  Yes, yes, I'm gone from Fox, I miss those days, and I wish Tucker well, he has a huge
[2:50:45.760 --> 2:50:49.760]  audience like you do, it's not as big as yours, but he has the biggest audience, I don't know,
[2:50:49.760 --> 2:50:50.760]  it's pretty big.
[2:50:50.760 --> 2:50:51.760]  All right, well, that's what he says.
[2:50:51.760 --> 2:50:55.080]  I'll say I'm up there with Joe Rogan and Tucker, thanks to the audience, but yeah, we're kind
[2:50:55.080 --> 2:50:58.360]  of the three headed dragon.
[2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:04.240]  But the big audience gives you a cushion, because the audience pays the bills, and Fox
[2:51:04.240 --> 2:51:10.880]  is not dumb, they know that, but Tucker is as fearless as you, as you and I are, I hope
[2:51:10.880 --> 2:51:14.760]  to be back in the media soon, I have my own podcast as you know, Judging Freedom, when
[2:51:14.760 --> 2:51:18.840]  you're on it, the numbers go through the roof, or Colonel Doug McGregor or Scott Ritter
[2:51:18.840 --> 2:51:24.000]  are on it, or Ron Paul is on it, the numbers go through the roof, and I'm deeply grateful
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.120]  for all my YouTube followers.
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:29.880]  Well, you seem better than ever with your podcast, I mean, I literally watch it at least
[2:51:29.880 --> 2:51:30.880]  twice a week.
[2:51:30.880 --> 2:51:34.920]  Well, that's, that's very gratifying, and I know that's, it's gratifying for you to
[2:51:34.920 --> 2:51:38.720]  say that to your huge audience, and I hope they, they watch it as well.
[2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:44.640]  I try to inform as best I can, a little bit of breaking news as we're speaking, the Supreme
[2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:50.160]  Court of the United States has just denied the petition of Senator Lindsey Graham to
[2:51:50.160 --> 2:51:54.520]  be relieved from the obligation to testify before a grand jury in Atlanta.
[2:51:54.520 --> 2:52:00.400]  So the criminal investigation of whatever Trump's people attempted to do in Atlanta moves forward,
[2:52:00.400 --> 2:52:04.840]  and Senator Graham is now a reluctant and involuntary witness.
[2:52:04.840 --> 2:52:09.160]  This is not a big deal, but in the Supreme Court world, it's a big deal.
[2:52:09.160 --> 2:52:10.160]  No, no, it is a big deal.
[2:52:10.160 --> 2:52:11.760]  That was my next question.
[2:52:11.760 --> 2:52:12.840]  I'm not wedded to Trump.
[2:52:12.840 --> 2:52:16.400]  I think he means well, I know you've been very close to him, but also at issues.
[2:52:16.400 --> 2:52:20.760]  The shot issue of, I mean, even to Sanis has gotten away from the shot as his Surgeon
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:25.120]  General has, everybody's hurting against it, even Ben Shapiro has come out against it.
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:26.920]  Trump is still up there pushing it.
[2:52:26.920 --> 2:52:31.000]  That, what, what, why is he doing that?
[2:52:31.000 --> 2:52:36.720]  Trump hasn't, listen, I say this is somebody that's known for 35 years, and who he had
[2:52:36.720 --> 2:52:40.520]  been with him many times alone, even while he was president.
[2:52:40.520 --> 2:52:44.720]  He has an enormous ego and is determined to wrestle the way it has back.
[2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:46.920]  I think he's going to be indicted.
[2:52:46.920 --> 2:52:52.280]  I also think if the Republicans nominate him, they're crazy because then the issue becomes
[2:52:52.280 --> 2:52:54.560]  his personality and his character.
[2:52:54.560 --> 2:52:56.760]  He also, he energizes Democrats.
[2:52:56.760 --> 2:52:58.360]  He energizes the Democrats.
[2:52:58.360 --> 2:53:00.160]  Yes, he does.
[2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:07.440]  The issue in 2024 should be the blatant utter total incompetence of the Biden administration.
[2:53:07.440 --> 2:53:12.040]  If Trump is the Republican nominee, it doesn't matter who the Democrats nominate.
[2:53:12.040 --> 2:53:18.280]  The issue will be Trump himself and his personal behavior is quite frankly, indefensible.
[2:53:18.280 --> 2:53:23.000]  If half of what the federal government has on him is provable, it's criminal and he should
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:24.000]  be indicted.
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:25.200]  Well, let's give some inside baseball.
[2:53:25.200 --> 2:53:26.200]  I'm loyal to people.
[2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:30.200]  I think Trump means, well, I like Trump, but let's just get down to brass tacks.
[2:53:30.200 --> 2:53:34.680]  Even Tucker at a certain point broke with Trump because of the, they were talking every day.
[2:53:34.680 --> 2:53:39.320]  You at some point broke with Trump and there's, there's this people, Drudge broke with him
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:42.720]  and I don't like the direction Drudge went, he went to the other extreme, which is a shame
[2:53:42.720 --> 2:53:46.720]  on him in my view, but, but we were all staunch supporters of him.
[2:53:46.720 --> 2:53:52.680]  When I revealed that the Obama administration used the British spies to spy on his campaign,
[2:53:52.680 --> 2:53:54.440]  I was excoriated.
[2:53:54.440 --> 2:53:57.640]  I took tremendous, you almost lost your job for that.
[2:53:57.640 --> 2:53:58.640]  You were right.
[2:53:58.640 --> 2:53:59.640]  It was true.
[2:53:59.640 --> 2:54:00.640]  Correct.
[2:54:00.640 --> 2:54:01.720]  I believed in him.
[2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:06.240]  And then four British spies went to the five, went to the Guardian of London and said that
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:09.960]  a judge in New York that everybody's ripping apart, the one that's defending Trump.
[2:54:09.960 --> 2:54:10.960]  He's right.
[2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:12.760]  We were involved in it.
[2:54:12.760 --> 2:54:18.360]  So the point is, I have come from a staunch defender of him to a person who believes he
[2:54:18.360 --> 2:54:25.000]  is by character and intellect, not appropriate to be a public official.
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:26.320]  Let him run his company.
[2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:27.720]  Let him make all the money he wants.
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:32.160]  Let him build all the skyscrapers he wants, but keep the levers of government power away
[2:54:32.160 --> 2:54:33.160]  from him.
[2:54:33.160 --> 2:54:37.000]  What do you think of DeSantis?
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:39.320]  I think DeSantis is Trump without the baggage, Alex.
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:43.640]  I mean, I don't agree with him on anything, but I think he can rally Republicans and
[2:54:43.640 --> 2:54:49.840]  independents behind him to an effective degree and defeat whoever they are.
[2:54:49.840 --> 2:54:50.840]  What are your problems with it?
[2:54:50.840 --> 2:54:55.000]  The sculling bones thing or what are you concerned about with DeSantis?
[2:54:55.000 --> 2:55:01.880]  You know, I don't agree with what DeSantis has done to suppress LGBTQ rights.
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:07.560]  I don't agree with what DeSantis did with respect to shipping immigrants who were here
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:11.160]  legally from Texas to Martha's Vineyard.
[2:55:11.160 --> 2:55:17.160]  Aside from that, and those are not huge issues to me, DeSantis could very well save the Republican
[2:55:17.160 --> 2:55:20.680]  Party and save us from Trump.
[2:55:20.680 --> 2:55:24.840]  Well, I know this with my listeners, and I don't do what my listeners tell me, but
[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:26.920]  I listen to them and I have the same feelings.
[2:55:26.920 --> 2:55:30.920]  They're just getting madder and madder about him not coming out against the shot when they
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:32.120]  admit it doesn't work.
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:34.680]  I mean, even the Democrats are in the news.
[2:55:34.680 --> 2:55:39.560]  The Atlantic is the voice of the Democrats says, you know, oh, let's have an amnesty.
[2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:40.560]  Let's forget COVID.
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:43.800]  No, we're not going to forget the lockdowns and the attempted forced shots and all the
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:45.800]  rest of it.
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:52.040]  Listen, Gretchen Wilmer, the governor of Michigan is in the run for her life because of her
[2:55:52.040 --> 2:55:57.080]  draconian lockdowns and she may very well lose.
[2:55:57.080 --> 2:56:01.600]  That governor whose picture we see now did not impose any lockdowns.
[2:56:01.600 --> 2:56:06.040]  The governor of New Jersey won by the skin of his teeth in a state that the Democrats
[2:56:06.040 --> 2:56:09.120]  never lose because of these lockdowns.
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:14.040]  We all know that the vaccination does not prevent you from getting sick and it does
[2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:17.080]  not prevent you from transmitting the sickness.
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:23.280]  It may and some people temper the force of the sickness, but it doesn't prevent transmission.
[2:56:23.280 --> 2:56:25.600]  There was no reason to force this upon people.
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:27.680]  There was no reason to close the schools.
[2:56:27.680 --> 2:56:29.600]  There was no reason to close businesses.
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:35.040]  There was no reason to fire cops and firemen and EMS workers who declined to take it.
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:37.080]  It's about time Trump acknowledged that.
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:41.440]  All right, you got to join us more often, not just every few months.
[2:56:41.440 --> 2:56:44.400]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, I'd love for you to host the fourth hour some days if you'd
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:45.400]  like to.
[2:56:45.400 --> 2:56:47.400]  God bless you, my friend.
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:48.400]  I'd be thrilled to do it.
[2:56:48.400 --> 2:56:52.680]  Alex, I'm going to be in Austin for a wedding in January.
[2:56:52.680 --> 2:56:55.720]  I hope I can come into your studio when I'm there.
[2:56:55.720 --> 2:56:58.160]  You better come in the studio for all the shows.
[2:56:58.160 --> 2:57:01.040]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, thank you so much.
[2:57:01.040 --> 2:57:02.320]  All the best, my man.
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:03.320]  Thank you.
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:06.400]  All right, we got some breaking news with Saudi Arabia and Iran and more all hit before
[2:57:06.400 --> 2:57:08.400]  Royce White takes over.
[2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:10.120]  And again, folks, I like Trump.
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:11.520]  I like him getting Republicans elected.
[2:57:11.520 --> 2:57:15.560]  I like what he's doing and I don't want to see him destroyed and maybe his persecution
[2:57:15.560 --> 2:57:16.560]  is wrong.
[2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:20.920]  But when it comes to these shots, folks, it is a it is the children come first.
[2:57:20.920 --> 2:57:29.840]  I mean, God, the children, my family, the country, and then good leaders.
[2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:32.120]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[2:57:32.120 --> 2:57:39.000]  Children Trump Trump big time in my in my deck of cards and that that's where I met when
[2:57:39.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  it comes to these shots.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:42.080]  I'll continue to support him on the good stuff he does.
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:47.080]  I'll continue to go after him on the shots.
[2:57:47.080 --> 2:57:53.240]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy.
[2:57:53.240 --> 2:57:58.920]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[2:57:58.920 --> 2:58:02.520]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[2:58:02.520 --> 2:58:06.080]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:12.080]  It's came over and all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:17.280]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[2:58:17.280 --> 2:58:22.640]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com,
[2:58:22.640 --> 2:58:23.640]  it changes the world.
[2:58:23.640 --> 2:58:28.560]  And that's why when you go to infowars.com and get amazing products that empower you
[2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:33.240]  and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the
[2:58:33.240 --> 2:58:35.800]  tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[2:58:35.800 --> 2:58:42.040]  The fight starts at infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowars.com.
[2:58:42.040 --> 2:58:47.280]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[2:58:47.280 --> 2:58:53.160]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[2:58:53.160 --> 2:58:58.520]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[2:58:58.520 --> 2:59:00.600]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[2:59:00.600 --> 2:59:03.400]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[2:59:03.400 --> 2:59:06.600]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or
[2:59:06.600 --> 2:59:08.040]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[2:59:08.040 --> 2:59:12.160]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on their 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[2:59:12.160 --> 2:59:16.480]  all of this and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[2:59:16.480 --> 2:59:17.480]  your support.
[2:59:17.480 --> 2:59:20.600]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[2:59:20.600 --> 2:59:25.080]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[2:59:25.080 --> 2:59:29.040]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful infowars has been because
[2:59:29.040 --> 2:59:30.040]  of your past support.
[2:59:30.040 --> 2:59:34.240]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,

[2:59:38.680 --> 2:59:39.680]  on air.
[2:59:39.680 --> 2:59:41.680]  1776 is the promo code.
[2:59:41.680 --> 2:59:49.040]  The destination is infowarsstore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[2:59:49.040 --> 3:00:15.040]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:19.040 --> 3:00:25.400]  All right, Roy Swine always kicking ass to be taken over, but I got some big news we're
[3:00:25.400 --> 3:00:30.200]  about to hit in a moment here ahead of the war room in one hour with Owen Schreuer.
[3:00:30.200 --> 3:00:33.840]  Look, we've already covered this, but now there's more statements for the pit on the
[3:00:33.840 --> 3:00:35.120]  Washington Post.
[3:00:35.120 --> 3:00:41.640]  Last week, last Friday, the Pentagon said we may use Nukes first on Russia for non-nuclear
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:48.240]  confrontations against non-nuclear forces, just gigantic escalation, and now we've got
[3:00:48.240 --> 3:00:50.080]  the Washington Post today.
[3:00:50.080 --> 3:00:54.000]  The official who spoke in addition to have an enemy to provide a military update would
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:01:00.280]  not say where the inspections are taking place or how close the battlefields the US troops
[3:01:00.280 --> 3:01:01.280]  are getting.
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:04.640]  The officials of the US personnel can't do inspections close to the front lines, but
[3:01:04.640 --> 3:01:08.360]  they aren't going where security conditions allow.
[3:01:08.360 --> 3:01:11.840]  So they admit US troops, which we already knew, are on the ground.
[3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:16.800]  They've been there since before February, battling and fighting Russians.
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:21.200]  US military now doing on-site weapons inspections.
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:22.640]  That means training.
[3:01:22.640 --> 3:01:28.520]  That means advisors like we got in the Vietnam War in 1960 that didn't really officially
[3:01:28.520 --> 3:01:31.120]  announce it until the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964.
[3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:36.960]  So they're just letting you know now we're at full war with Russia.
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:43.720]  Continuing here, Saudi Arabia, US on high alert after warning of imminent Iranian attack.
[3:01:43.720 --> 3:01:48.560]  Saudi Arabia assured intelligence with US warning of an imminent attack from Iran on
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:51.840]  targets in the kingdom, putting the American military and others in the Middle East on
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:52.840]  elevated alert.
[3:01:52.840 --> 3:01:56.240]  Saudi officials have said in response to a warning, Saudi Arabia said the US and several
[3:01:56.240 --> 3:02:00.320]  other neighboring states have raised a level of alert for their military forces.
[3:02:00.320 --> 3:02:07.640]  The officials said they didn't provide any details of Saudi intelligence.
[3:02:07.640 --> 3:02:14.760]  Saudi Arabia living in totally, absolutely dangerous times and it's only going to get
[3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:17.080]  more insane from this point on.
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:22.040]  Now let me hit some of the COVID stack I didn't get to earlier because this is important.
[3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:25.200]  I mentioned this, but let's drill back into it.
[3:02:25.200 --> 3:02:33.040]  You murderous hypocrites, outrage ensues after the Atlantic suggests amnesty for pandemic
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:39.640]  authoritarians, the mouthpiece owned by the widow of Steve Jobs, who basically lived at
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:45.800]  Epstein Island, is give us amnesty, leave us alone.
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:46.800]  Sure we lied to you.
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:50.480]  Sure we gave you a poison shot, but that's okay.
[3:02:50.480 --> 3:02:54.280]  It's for your own good.
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:03:00.720]  And everybody marbles at a clip from myself in 2002 predicting an authoritarian global
[3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:04.000]  government UN regime with forced inoculations and lockdowns.
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:07.600]  There's countless other clips of me in the last 20 plus years laying all that out from
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:08.600]  their own documents.
[3:03:08.600 --> 3:03:13.400]  But there's a clip going viral that will air on the other side of the spray before Royce
[3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:18.800]  White takes over of David Ike in 1997.
[3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:21.640]  We're going to play this clip when we come back and then hand the baton to Royce White.
[3:03:21.640 --> 3:03:22.840]  Let me just throw this out there.
[3:03:22.840 --> 3:03:24.160]  We're going to stay on air indefinitely.
[3:03:24.160 --> 3:03:27.240]  We got two years of appeals against these ridiculous judgments.
[3:03:27.240 --> 3:03:31.680]  You heard Andrew Napolitano and you heard Judge Joe Brown say they will be overturned
[3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:32.680]  or the country's gone.
[3:03:32.680 --> 3:03:33.680]  They're totally legal.
[3:03:33.680 --> 3:03:34.680]  They're frauds.
[3:03:34.680 --> 3:03:38.520]  So as long as you fund us and we have attorney's fees to pay and appeals fees, we will stay
[3:03:38.520 --> 3:03:39.520]  on air.
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:42.840]  Plus we get great, incredible products you need.
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:50.280]  And today is the last day to get 60% off on DNA Force Plus, X3, Bita Mineral Fusion,
[3:03:50.280 --> 3:03:57.520]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, Ultimate Fish Oil, Ultimate Crill Oil, they're all incredible.
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:05.040]  At infowarstore.com we're promo code at checkout 1776.
[3:04:05.040 --> 3:04:11.800]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139 and then I personally am almost out of money.
[3:04:11.800 --> 3:04:13.480]  I got to pay 40% of legal bills.
[3:04:13.480 --> 3:04:15.920]  The bankruptcy court said fine.
[3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:17.720]  Thanks for your support.
[3:04:17.720 --> 3:04:18.720]  Go to saveinfowars.com.
[3:04:18.720 --> 3:04:22.680]  Make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, whatever you can, $1,000.
[3:04:22.680 --> 3:04:23.680]  I love you.
[3:04:23.680 --> 3:04:24.880]  I appreciate you.
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:25.880]  You know who you are.
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:27.600]  Want to thank those that haven't made donations.
[3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:33.480]  Want to encourage those that haven't to go to saveinfowars.com.
[3:04:33.480 --> 3:04:34.480]  Saveinfowars.com.
[3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:35.480]  Make a donation.
[3:04:35.480 --> 3:04:36.480]  Keep us on air.
[3:04:36.480 --> 3:04:39.560]  We're barely in the black, barely almost in the red.
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:43.240]  I humbly ask you for myself and your future and all of us together.
[3:04:43.240 --> 3:04:44.400]  Who's fighting this hard?
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:45.400]  Nobody.
[3:04:45.400 --> 3:04:46.520]  We're up against the new world order.
[3:04:46.520 --> 3:04:50.000]  They're coming directly at us with intelligence agencies, but we'll win with your support.
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:04:53.600]  Your prayers, your word of mouth, your financial support, saveinfowars.com.
[3:04:53.600 --> 3:05:00.080]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:06.400]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge in the tip
[3:05:06.400 --> 3:05:07.400]  of the spear.
[3:05:07.400 --> 3:05:11.200]  And when we talk about the products at infowarsstore.com, they all blow you away.
[3:05:11.200 --> 3:05:15.240]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be, we'll be customers.
[3:05:15.240 --> 3:05:20.120]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back in stock, it's X3.
[3:05:20.120 --> 3:05:26.920]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,
[3:05:26.920 --> 3:05:30.760]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[3:05:30.760 --> 3:05:37.200]  So X3, despite the fact that it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right
[3:05:37.200 --> 3:05:43.000]  now at infowarsstore.com, and it funds the Infowar, which is a 360 win.
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:47.120]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, takes two weeks to kick out on average, you've
[3:05:47.120 --> 3:06:02.520]  got to go to infowarsstore.com and get X3, 50% off, X3, 50% off, infowarsstore.com.
[3:06:02.520 --> 3:06:08.120]  It's Tuesday now, it refers to 2022, about to hand the baton to the great Roy Swine.
[3:06:08.120 --> 3:06:13.640]  But I wanted to get to these clips before I ejected from the transmission.
[3:06:13.640 --> 3:06:20.840]  Most give me a lot of credit, but if you go back to David Eich, he was laying out exactly
[3:06:20.840 --> 3:06:24.560]  what was coming in many cases, even before I did, and quite frankly, I wasn't following
[3:06:24.560 --> 3:06:25.560]  David Eich very closely.
[3:06:25.560 --> 3:06:26.560]  Then I had him on sometimes.
[3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:31.160]  He separately was looking at the same research I was, coming to the exact same conclusion
[3:06:31.160 --> 3:06:33.240]  with incredible precision.
[3:06:33.240 --> 3:06:37.360]  And the reason I raised the point is not to say I don't follow David Eich or listen to
[3:06:37.360 --> 3:06:38.360]  David Eich, I do.
[3:06:38.360 --> 3:06:42.400]  The point is, is that we're separately studying coming to the same conclusion, just like you
[3:06:42.400 --> 3:06:44.240]  will once the blinders are off.
[3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:49.920]  Here he is talking about the coming medical tyranny, because we see Kyrie Irving and others
[3:06:49.920 --> 3:06:51.880]  putting on a clip where I predicted it all.
[3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:52.880]  That was in 2002.
[3:06:52.880 --> 3:06:56.280]  Here's David Eich five years before.
[3:06:56.280 --> 3:07:03.560]  They were going to create new viruses in laboratories that were resistant to drugs, that they were
[3:07:03.560 --> 3:07:09.600]  going to use that to cull the population, that they were going to use vaccinations to cull
[3:07:09.600 --> 3:07:16.920]  the population, and also that they were going to change the way that healthcare treated
[3:07:16.920 --> 3:07:24.400]  old people so that more and more old people died and didn't go long into life because
[3:07:24.400 --> 3:07:30.960]  from their extraordinarily sick perspective, old people are useless to them.
[3:07:30.960 --> 3:07:38.080]  And what we're looking at now very clearly is this attempt to play that card of mass
[3:07:38.080 --> 3:07:47.640]  global immunization with a excuse of this manufactured virus to get access to the bodies,
[3:07:47.640 --> 3:07:52.840]  the body computer systems, as I would say, of almost everyone on the planet.
[3:07:52.840 --> 3:07:56.680]  And they're not doing that because they want to protect people from anything, crikey.
[3:07:56.680 --> 3:08:01.120]  The force that's saying be vaccinated is the force that created the virus, which they're
[3:08:01.120 --> 3:08:03.920]  saying be vaccinated against.
[3:08:03.920 --> 3:08:10.040]  They're doing this to get access to the global population for very, very malevolent reasons.
[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:18.200]  And what people need to realize is that these families do not come from the same perspective
[3:08:18.200 --> 3:08:20.720]  of life and respect that we do.
[3:08:20.720 --> 3:08:26.640]  They see humans like cattle, nothing more than cattle, most humans see cattle.
[3:08:26.640 --> 3:08:32.400]  They therefore have no empathy with the consequences for the human population of their actions.
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:38.640]  So if people say, they'd never do that, mate, no, no, you'd never do that.
[3:08:38.640 --> 3:08:40.960]  They do it all the time.
[3:08:40.960 --> 3:08:43.240]  And 25 years later, exactly what he said happened.
[3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:48.560]  Here's a little bit of me a few years later laying it out.
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:53.040]  Facts and common sense are in, yes, there have been corrupt empires, yes, they manipulate,
[3:08:53.040 --> 3:08:57.400]  yes, there are secret societies, yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history,
[3:08:57.400 --> 3:09:04.320]  and yes, today in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:12.560]  Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and
[3:09:12.560 --> 3:09:18.400]  complete tyranny, where human beings are absolutely worthless.
[3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:23.240]  There's six and a quarter plus billion of us and the globalists have said it many times,
[3:09:23.240 --> 3:09:28.200]  there's too many of us, we're causing a problem, we need to be called at the tune of 80%.
[3:09:28.200 --> 3:09:33.080]  It's amazing to talk about that, but it's the globalists, the UN, their own public statements
[3:09:33.080 --> 3:09:39.320]  and they've convinced a lot of liberals and elitist conservatives and others that by going
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:43.800]  along with this, we're intelligent members of society.
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:47.120]  It's the ultimate mouthless world view.
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:58.320]  This is this radical, virulent form of social Darwinism, it's the excuse of tyrants.
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:02.840]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies
[3:10:02.840 --> 3:10:09.400]  that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing healthcare, the state becomes
[3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:14.720]  God, basically, when it comes to your health, and then by releasing diseases and viruses
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:20.880]  and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[3:10:20.880 --> 3:10:21.880]  And become slaves.
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:26.200]  We're about to go to our guest host who is loaded for bear, but I want to play one more
[3:10:26.200 --> 3:10:27.200]  clip.
[3:10:27.200 --> 3:10:34.500]  This is yesterday in the Australian government, a senator, Senator Malcolm Roberts, pointing
[3:10:34.500 --> 3:10:38.400]  out that the House of Cards has collapsed, and then when we come back, Roy Swight will
[3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:40.880]  take over.
[3:10:40.880 --> 3:10:46.960]  The only thing about our death rate in 2020 that was unusual was that it was at a seven
[3:10:46.960 --> 3:10:48.460]  year low.
[3:10:48.460 --> 3:10:49.600]  These are facts.
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:53.480]  This makes a joke of provisional approval granted for injections out of urgency.
[3:10:53.480 --> 3:10:55.920]  There was no urgency.
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:10:59.760]  Once the injection rollout started, there was a spike in deaths.
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:02.240]  It must be noted correlation is not causation.
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:06.680]  The link between the cause, vaccines, and the effect death, injury, and suffering must
[3:11:06.680 --> 3:11:07.680]  be proven.
[3:11:07.680 --> 3:11:11.960]  Well, it has now been proven beyond the shadow of a doubt.
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:17.400]  At my second COVID under question inquiry in August, many highly qualified medical professionals
[3:11:17.400 --> 3:11:22.000]  from around the world established that link, providing evidence the injections were responsible
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:25.200]  for many more deaths than the health technocrats admit.
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:30.560]  And then late last month, the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Immunology published an article
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:35.240]  entitled COVID-19 Vaccines and Australian Review.
[3:11:35.240 --> 3:11:40.120]  Others are Connie Turney and Astrid Leffringhausen from the University of Queensland published
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:41.760]  journal article.
[3:11:41.760 --> 3:11:45.820]  This article details the medical science behind the wide range of medical harms being inflicted
[3:11:45.820 --> 3:11:51.680]  on Australians as a result of the hubris, the criminal negligence of health technocrats.
[3:11:51.680 --> 3:11:54.840]  I promise to hound you people down.
[3:11:54.840 --> 3:11:56.680]  And now science has done that for me.
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:00.520]  The issue of vaccine harm must be referred to a Royal Commission today.
[3:12:00.520 --> 3:12:03.500]  These criminals must be brought to justice.
[3:12:03.500 --> 3:12:08.200]  This report is reproduced on my website, and anyone who reads this report and still
[3:12:08.200 --> 3:12:12.680]  defends the fake vaccines is as guilty as the companies that made it.
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:18.280]  It's no surprise that COVID has spiked in correlation with the rollout of the fake vaccines.
[3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:24.960]  ABS data is not yet available for 2022, although Australian actuarial data is.
[3:12:24.960 --> 3:12:29.960]  In the first four months of 2022, death from all respiratory diseases, the flu, pneumonia
[3:12:29.960 --> 3:12:33.120]  and COVID taken together, are still at normal levels.
[3:12:33.120 --> 3:12:39.040]  Yet deaths from cardiac and pulmonary events are up 11% and unexplained deaths are up 13%.
[3:12:39.040 --> 3:12:46.640]  At this rate, an extra 10,000 Australians will die in 2022, 10,000 extra.
[3:12:46.640 --> 3:12:59.240]  Anyone reading the journal article I just referred will know exactly why this is happening.
[3:12:59.240 --> 3:13:00.240]  Welcome.
[3:13:00.240 --> 3:13:05.240]  I'm your guest host for the rest of the hour, Royce White here from Minneapolis, live from
[3:13:05.240 --> 3:13:10.240]  Minneapolis, the belly of the beast, the belly of the beast, one of the one of the outposts
[3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:14.120]  of globalism.
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:18.880]  Thank you to Alex Jones for allowing me to host again in such a legendary time on such
[3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:21.480]  an iconic platform.
[3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:27.080]  Long time viewer of Alex Jones and Info Wars, and I say that apologetically and unabashedly.
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:33.080]  Also want to thank the Info Wars team for always thinking of me to be able to come and
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:35.440]  help Alex out and guest host when I can.
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:37.880]  It really is an honor and a privilege.
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:40.160]  A lot of things to discuss today.
[3:13:40.160 --> 3:13:41.800]  So much going on.
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:44.120]  You know, we got the election in Brazil.
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:48.600]  We got old face, old faithful politics and sports.
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:52.800]  I always say never, never say that you want to keep your politics and your sports separate
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:54.640]  because they're never separate.
[3:13:54.640 --> 3:13:58.680]  It's our sports and sports, our politics and the politics are never off.
[3:13:58.680 --> 3:14:05.360]  And we haven't seen a political hit job in my lifetime, like the one that's being done
[3:14:05.360 --> 3:14:06.480]  against Kyrie Irving.
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:12.640]  I mean, week after week, wave after wave, the mainstream media establishment is trying
[3:14:12.640 --> 3:14:17.480]  to crack Kyrie Irving and back them into a corner and pressure them into saying something
[3:14:17.480 --> 3:14:24.320]  that they can then justify, probably suspend them without pay and, you know, and then eventually
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:27.760]  just getting them out of the league and then they'll say, hey, he's too old, he's not good
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:28.760]  enough anymore.
[3:14:28.760 --> 3:14:31.960]  There's some other young guards that are better than better than him.
[3:14:31.960 --> 3:14:35.880]  And there's so many people at home that don't even watch sports close enough or don't even
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:40.920]  care enough about injustice that Kyrie would would fade into the background.
[3:14:40.920 --> 3:14:46.800]  Although I do believe that Kyrie has the spirit and the intuition and the desire to stay
[3:14:46.800 --> 3:14:52.200]  in the fight for truth, it would use all the resources at his disposal to continue to wage
[3:14:52.200 --> 3:14:55.080]  war back against these people.
[3:14:55.080 --> 3:15:02.520]  And then you got, you know, the ripples of the Kanye West incident that are still lingering
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:03.520]  around.
[3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:07.480]  So we're going to talk about that much more over the course of the segment.
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:10.560]  Nothing more important than what's, you know, and I said it one of the first times I was
[3:15:10.560 --> 3:15:13.840]  on Alex Jones, race isn't the biggest issue.
[3:15:13.840 --> 3:15:17.760]  But if you can't talk about a people and their culture, if you can't talk about a society
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:22.520]  and its culture, then you can't talk about a society, so we have to be able to say black
[3:15:22.520 --> 3:15:23.560]  people.
[3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:25.960]  We have to be able to say Asian people.
[3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:28.440]  We have to be able to say Latinos and Hispanics.
[3:15:28.440 --> 3:15:33.360]  We have to be able to say white people, although I'm murky on what the white definition is
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:36.800]  and we can talk some about that over the course of the segment, but we have to be able to
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:39.640]  say Jews, the Jewish community.
[3:15:39.640 --> 3:15:43.400]  We have to be able to talk about people and their culture and their traditions in order
[3:15:43.400 --> 3:15:46.880]  to be able to talk about where we are in society today.
[3:15:46.880 --> 3:15:49.480]  And we're going to do that live from here in Minneapolis.
[3:15:49.480 --> 3:15:51.640]  Stay over to the other side of the break.
[3:15:51.640 --> 3:15:53.440]  I'm your guest, host Royce White.
[3:15:53.440 --> 3:15:54.440]  Thank you.
[3:15:54.440 --> 3:16:02.520]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support, Info Wars continues
[3:16:02.520 --> 3:16:07.480]  to persevere against the attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent
[3:16:07.480 --> 3:16:08.480]  media.
[3:16:08.480 --> 3:16:09.480]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[3:16:09.480 --> 3:16:11.800]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:16.240]  You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept Info Wars and free speech on the
[3:16:16.240 --> 3:16:17.240]  air.
[3:16:17.240 --> 3:16:21.320]  And I thank you, but now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't
[3:16:21.320 --> 3:16:22.320]  pay them.
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:23.320]  Now I need your support.
[3:16:23.320 --> 3:16:27.720]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:32.720]  against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com.
[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:39.160]  And saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL that gives him go for direct Alex Jones legal defense
[3:16:39.160 --> 3:16:40.160]  fund.
[3:16:40.160 --> 3:16:44.280]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making is almost over.
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:48.520]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[3:16:48.520 --> 3:16:52.160]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[3:16:52.160 --> 3:16:56.600]  and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[3:16:56.600 --> 3:17:01.840]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[3:17:01.840 --> 3:17:02.840]  you.
[3:17:02.840 --> 3:17:07.160]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence Info Wars because they rightly see
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:12.280]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[3:17:12.280 --> 3:17:16.480]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[3:17:16.480 --> 3:17:22.600]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from infowars.com
[3:17:22.600 --> 3:17:26.840]  and to also financially support infowars.com at the most critical time on our fight by
[3:17:26.840 --> 3:17:32.080]  using promo code 1776 at checkout, so you get additional 10% off.
[3:17:32.080 --> 3:17:34.160]  These people are coming for your birthright.
[3:17:34.160 --> 3:17:35.680]  They're coming for your First Amendment.
[3:17:35.680 --> 3:17:38.960]  They admit once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:42.960]  I am in your hands and I'm asking of your support now, you have my commitment to never
[3:17:42.960 --> 3:17:46.320]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[3:17:46.320 --> 3:17:49.760]  Thank you for all your past support and I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts
[3:17:49.760 --> 3:17:55.840]  at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776 for additional 10% off on the already big sales
[3:17:55.840 --> 3:17:57.120]  and huge discounts.
[3:17:57.120 --> 3:18:03.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[3:18:03.000 --> 3:18:08.360]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[3:18:08.360 --> 3:18:12.240]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[3:18:12.240 --> 3:18:13.240]  to speak freely.
[3:18:13.240 --> 3:18:16.200]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or are they going to go for Steve Bannon,
[3:18:16.200 --> 3:18:17.920]  or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[3:18:17.920 --> 3:18:22.040]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:23.040]  all of this.
[3:18:23.040 --> 3:18:26.360]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:27.360]  your support.
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:30.480]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:34.960]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[3:18:34.960 --> 3:18:38.640]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[3:18:38.640 --> 3:18:40.320]  because of your past support.
[3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:44.120]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[3:18:44.120 --> 3:18:48.520]  free double your efforts by visiting infowarstore.com and getting amazing products that keep us
[3:18:48.520 --> 3:18:49.520]  on air.

[3:18:56.800 --> 3:19:02.960]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:08.680]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:12.280]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:16.720]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over, and
[3:19:16.720 --> 3:19:22.720]  all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back, and our main
[3:19:22.720 --> 3:19:27.000]  tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:32.400]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video, or infowars.com, or newswars.com,
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:33.400]  it changes the world.

[3:19:38.280 --> 3:19:42.960]  and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the

[3:19:51.760 --> 3:19:58.160]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[3:19:58.160 --> 3:20:04.160]  Meeting of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:03:41.100 --> 3:20:35.160]  the power of the Lord comes down.
[3:20:35.160 --> 3:20:42.160]  Every hour, every minute, every second, every second, oh.
[3:20:42.160 --> 3:20:49.160]  We need you, we need you, we need you.
[3:20:49.160 --> 3:20:59.160]  What is white is white.
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:05.160]  What you're watching right there is the real reason why they went after Kanye West.
[3:21:05.160 --> 3:21:06.160]  They can't fool me.
[3:21:06.160 --> 3:21:09.380]  They can't fool me and make it be about Donald Trump.
[3:21:09.380 --> 3:21:14.800]  They can't fool me and make it be about fashion or Balenciaga or Kim Kardashian or any of
[3:21:14.800 --> 3:21:19.040]  these other little side stories, side shows
[3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:20.760]  that they wanna make it be about.
[3:21:20.760 --> 3:21:22.240]  I know the truth.
[3:21:22.240 --> 3:21:23.080]  I know the truth.
[3:21:23.080 --> 3:21:24.360]  I came from the black community.
[3:21:24.360 --> 3:21:27.120]  I grew up in a black community, a real black neighborhood
[3:21:27.120 --> 3:21:29.360]  where you had all of the things
[3:21:29.360 --> 3:21:32.080]  that a black neighborhood comes with.
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:34.160]  You had people who were hardworking.
[3:21:34.160 --> 3:21:35.660]  You had people who were not working.
[3:21:35.660 --> 3:21:36.860]  You had people who were homeless.
[3:21:36.860 --> 3:21:38.160]  You had people who were on drugs.
[3:21:38.160 --> 3:21:40.000]  You had people in gangs.
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:42.000]  You had people who shot each other.
[3:21:42.000 --> 3:21:43.920]  You had people who loved each other.
[3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:45.960]  You had the influence of hip hop.
[3:21:45.960 --> 3:21:47.600]  You had the influence of the church.
[3:21:47.600 --> 3:21:50.240]  All of it right there in one small,
[3:21:50.240 --> 3:21:54.200]  one tightly cramped up community.
[3:21:54.200 --> 3:21:57.800]  And Kanye West is one of the few individuals
[3:21:57.800 --> 3:22:01.760]  in our society and maybe in history
[3:22:01.760 --> 3:22:05.280]  that can take black musical talent
[3:22:05.280 --> 3:22:07.760]  and black culture and convert it
[3:22:07.760 --> 3:22:09.720]  into a ministry and gospel.
[3:22:09.720 --> 3:22:10.880]  And what you saw right there
[3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:14.560]  with the Sunday service choir was an example
[3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:18.000]  of just how good Kanye West can be at that
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:19.440]  and how powerful is that?
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:23.000]  I mean, you know, people wanna make it be political.
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:24.080]  It's not political.
[3:22:24.080 --> 3:22:25.400]  It's spiritual.
[3:22:25.400 --> 3:22:28.400]  The political is downstream from the spiritual.
[3:22:28.400 --> 3:22:33.400]  And how powerful is what was that clip?
[3:22:33.800 --> 3:22:35.680]  You know, I knew right away
[3:22:35.680 --> 3:22:40.680]  when Kanye West decided to make a career shift
[3:22:42.400 --> 3:22:45.120]  or brand shift to Jesus Christ
[3:22:45.120 --> 3:22:47.440]  that he was gonna have a big issue.
[3:22:47.440 --> 3:22:51.560]  And here, you know, I wanna piggyback off
[3:22:51.560 --> 3:22:52.840]  of where I left last time
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:56.000]  in talking about this question of Jew versus anti-Jew
[3:22:56.000 --> 3:22:57.200]  because this is, you know,
[3:22:57.200 --> 3:23:00.960]  that obviously outside of what's going to nuclear war,
[3:23:00.960 --> 3:23:05.960]  an election, and I don't know who scares the inflation.
[3:23:08.440 --> 3:23:11.360]  I guess the conversation about who's Jewish
[3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:14.440]  and who's not is the topic of the hour.
[3:23:14.440 --> 3:23:16.960]  And it's not, it's actually not in material.
[3:23:16.960 --> 3:23:19.880]  It's more significant than people give it credit for.
[3:23:19.880 --> 3:23:22.880]  And the last time I was on, I said that
[3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:27.880]  what's really being done to undermine the Jewish identity
[3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:31.120]  is to suspend the Jewish identity
[3:23:31.120 --> 3:23:35.040]  in a World War II and Holocaust context.
[3:23:35.040 --> 3:23:38.760]  And by doing that, you delegitimize or invalidate
[3:23:38.760 --> 3:23:41.200]  one of the single greatest historical records
[3:23:41.200 --> 3:23:44.200]  that we have of the covenant between God and Abraham.
[3:23:44.200 --> 3:23:48.960]  And the Jews were the stewards of that covenant,
[3:23:48.960 --> 3:23:53.120]  which is why they made great effort
[3:23:53.120 --> 3:23:56.320]  and they take very serious describing of the Torah.
[3:23:56.320 --> 3:24:00.120]  The young Jews who grew up observant of the faith
[3:24:00.120 --> 3:24:02.240]  and learned Yiddish and learned Hebrew
[3:24:02.240 --> 3:24:04.520]  actually scrived the Torah by hand.
[3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:07.800]  And that's a cultural tradition that goes right back
[3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:10.280]  to the Hierobinical Court of Moses himself.
[3:24:10.280 --> 3:24:13.120]  And it can't be, you know, anything that is upheld
[3:24:13.120 --> 3:24:17.720]  over 5,000 years must be respected for the commitment,
[3:24:17.720 --> 3:24:20.080]  just the basic commitment that that takes.
[3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:26.080]  So, I knew that Kanye West
[3:24:26.080 --> 3:24:27.040]  was gonna have a problem.
[3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:29.760]  And look, when you can't talk about people
[3:24:29.760 --> 3:24:31.160]  and their culture and their traditions,
[3:24:31.160 --> 3:24:32.320]  you can't talk about people.
[3:24:32.320 --> 3:24:34.120]  I said it at the top of the hour
[3:24:34.120 --> 3:24:35.680]  and I wanna reiterate it here
[3:24:36.760 --> 3:24:41.760]  because there is obviously a concerted effort
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:46.760]  by a group of people who call themselves Jews
[3:24:46.760 --> 3:24:49.720]  to take Kanye West off of a platform
[3:24:49.720 --> 3:24:54.720]  that they can undoubtedly be said
[3:24:54.720 --> 3:24:56.960]  was given to him by them.
[3:24:58.160 --> 3:24:59.920]  And that is the case.
[3:24:59.920 --> 3:25:03.880]  It is the case that there are a group of secular elite
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:07.200]  anti-Jews that run the music business.
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:10.360]  And they run basketball and pro sports to an extent too
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:14.840]  and they also run Hollywood.
[3:25:14.840 --> 3:25:18.040]  But the music business, especially the hip hop music
[3:25:18.040 --> 3:25:25.040]  business specifically is certainly run by these anti-Jews.
[3:25:25.040 --> 3:25:26.720]  And why is that important?
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:31.560]  What is the implication of making the distinction
[3:25:31.560 --> 3:25:34.760]  between who is Jewish and who is anti-Jewish?
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:36.880]  And I think it's important because,
[3:25:36.880 --> 3:25:39.960]  and I really think it's important for black people
[3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:41.760]  to stand up and articulate.
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:42.920]  Why?
[3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:47.360]  Because the post World War II Holocaust narrative
[3:25:47.360 --> 3:25:51.520]  around the Jews is one that is very similar
[3:25:51.520 --> 3:25:54.400]  to the post slavery narrative that is used for black people.
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:57.440]  And both of them are used to first justify
[3:25:57.440 --> 3:26:00.600]  and rope off and protect people from within
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:05.600]  our own communities that mean to exploit their own identity.
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:09.880]  And that is what the anti-Jews have done.
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:13.880]  The anti-Jews have used the Jewish identity
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:17.840]  as a cover and a shield for their corrupt practices,
[3:26:17.840 --> 3:26:20.400]  both in politics and in business.
[3:26:20.400 --> 3:26:21.880]  And they say, well, we're Jews.
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:24.720]  And my claim is, no, you're not.
[3:26:24.720 --> 3:26:26.640]  If you don't believe in God, if you reject God,
[3:26:26.640 --> 3:26:29.840]  if you reject everything that is Judaism, you're not a Jew.
[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:31.840]  And as a matter of fact, if you say you're a Jew
[3:26:31.840 --> 3:26:34.800]  but you reject all the fundamental tenets of being a Jew,
[3:26:34.800 --> 3:26:36.640]  that makes you an anti-Jew.
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:38.120]  Like if I'm a Christian and I say
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:39.720]  I don't believe in the existence of God,
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:41.280]  that would make me an anti-Christian.
[3:26:41.280 --> 3:26:44.080]  Now there are many Christians who say they believe in God
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:45.720]  but don't act as though they believe in God
[3:26:45.720 --> 3:26:46.720]  and that's something different.
[3:26:46.720 --> 3:26:49.560]  That would make you a Christian in name only.
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:51.240]  And that's an important distinction to make.
[3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:54.040]  The same thing could be said of the Muslims.
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:56.640]  There are many Muslims who are not observant
[3:26:56.640 --> 3:26:59.800]  of the Muslim faith or don't behave as though they believe
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:00.920]  in the Muslim faith.
[3:27:00.920 --> 3:27:03.600]  And you can look right at the Saudis if you need an example.
[3:27:03.600 --> 3:27:05.480]  And I think the Saudis are the best example.
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:06.920]  They are the globalist Muslims.
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:08.640]  They are the Muslims in name only.
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:10.920]  And there are others as well.
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:12.320]  And there are others across culture.
[3:27:12.320 --> 3:27:14.600]  There are all kinds of people who say they're one thing
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:16.320]  but their actions don't align with that.
[3:27:16.320 --> 3:27:18.080]  That's not what we're talking about.
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:20.120]  What we're talking about and what Kanye West
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:24.760]  has tried to allude to is who are these people
[3:27:24.760 --> 3:27:27.600]  in these positions of power in this industry
[3:27:27.600 --> 3:27:29.280]  who I can't even say by name.
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:32.080]  And we're gonna talk a little,
[3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:35.000]  we're gonna go even deeper into this in the next segment
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:37.480]  because I wanna unpack this even further
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:41.840]  in the info war that has been played on the broad swath
[3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:43.920]  of American people who just read headlines
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:47.440]  and are given their narratives with their morning coffee
[3:27:47.440 --> 3:27:49.200]  and their cereal and whatnot.
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:54.200]  And why it's so strange to look out and see people shill
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:27:57.000]  or that mainstream narrative.
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:02.000]  And there's very subtle, very, very distinct tricks
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:05.640]  that were played in the historical narrative
[3:28:05.640 --> 3:28:07.920]  to throw people completely off.
[3:28:07.920 --> 3:28:09.120]  But all Kanye West is saying,
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:11.400]  who are these people that I can't name?
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:13.480]  We're perfectly fine talking about black people
[3:28:13.480 --> 3:28:14.520]  as a community.
[3:28:14.520 --> 3:28:17.240]  We talk about white people with impunity,
[3:28:17.240 --> 3:28:19.160]  even though I don't know what people really mean
[3:28:19.160 --> 3:28:20.880]  when they say white, to be honest.
[3:28:20.880 --> 3:28:23.360]  And we'll get to that later as well.
[3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:24.800]  We're okay talking about Asians.
[3:28:24.800 --> 3:28:26.800]  We're okay talking about Muslims.
[3:28:26.800 --> 3:28:29.000]  We're okay talking about Arabs and Middle Easterns
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:32.560]  or Hispanics and Latinos or anybody else,
[3:28:32.560 --> 3:28:34.280]  but you can't even say the word Jew.
[3:28:34.280 --> 3:28:37.120]  And that's something that we can't allow
[3:28:37.120 --> 3:28:39.080]  to have an honest and open dialogue
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:41.920]  about where we are in society today.
[3:28:41.920 --> 3:28:44.440]  And when we come across on the other side,
[3:28:44.440 --> 3:28:45.840]  I wanna go a little bit deeper
[3:28:45.840 --> 3:28:50.300]  and talk about the roots of communism.
[3:28:51.280 --> 3:28:54.180]  Let's just go right back to the beginning.
[3:28:54.180 --> 3:28:55.020]  Stay tuned.

[3:30:12.280 --> 3:30:14.920]  but the world for the threat of the globalist

[3:30:57.160 --> 3:31:00.400]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member
[3:31:00.400 --> 3:31:03.840]  or a friend or a coworker that's on drugs or alcohol
[3:31:03.840 --> 3:31:06.360]  and is in a bad place and they need family and friends
[3:31:06.360 --> 3:31:08.480]  to come to their aid and talk to them
[3:31:08.480 --> 3:31:09.920]  and get them into rehab.
[3:31:09.920 --> 3:31:11.760]  Well, it's the same thing for America
[3:31:11.760 --> 3:31:13.160]  and the rest of the world.
[3:31:13.160 --> 3:31:15.560]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals
[3:31:15.560 --> 3:31:18.920]  that your body must have to live and people don't listen
[3:31:18.920 --> 3:31:21.960]  and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[3:31:21.960 --> 3:31:24.040]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[3:31:24.040 --> 3:31:27.840]  I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products
[3:31:27.840 --> 3:31:30.440]  like X3 from infowarstore.com,
[3:31:30.440 --> 3:31:33.680]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.

[3:31:36.160 --> 3:31:38.320]  the immune system boost is incredible.

[3:31:47.760 --> 3:31:49.000]  We're not selling it for that.

[3:31:57.520 --> 3:31:59.400]  It's our best seller.
[3:31:59.400 --> 3:32:01.320]  We first came out with it five years ago
[3:32:01.320 --> 3:32:03.160]  and it was a moderate seller.
[3:32:03.160 --> 3:32:05.280]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion
[3:32:05.280 --> 3:32:07.800]  and experienced the way it made it feel
[3:32:07.800 --> 3:32:09.120]  and how healthy it made them,
[3:32:09.120 --> 3:32:12.200]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[3:32:12.200 --> 3:32:13.280]  And it's been sold out for a while,
[3:32:13.280 --> 3:32:14.720]  but it's finally back in stock.
[3:32:14.720 --> 3:32:17.640]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge
[3:32:17.640 --> 3:32:18.760]  your immune system,
[3:32:18.760 --> 3:32:21.480]  but it helps every cellular function of the body
[3:32:21.480 --> 3:32:24.240]  and has all the minerals, all the key amino acids,
[3:32:24.240 --> 3:32:26.080]  all of the essential vitamins
[3:32:26.080 --> 3:32:28.520]  that you need to live and be healthy.
[3:32:28.520 --> 3:32:31.120]  Essential means without these things you die.
[3:32:31.120 --> 3:32:33.280]  And so much the food is debased.
[3:32:33.280 --> 3:32:35.080]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[3:32:35.080 --> 3:32:38.120]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[3:32:38.120 --> 3:32:39.280]  with a product like this.
[3:32:39.280 --> 3:32:42.000]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there,
[3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:43.800]  but this is amongst the very best
[3:32:43.800 --> 3:32:46.160]  and it's a low price and it funds the info war.
[3:32:46.160 --> 3:32:48.680]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today,
[3:32:48.680 --> 3:32:51.320]  getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock

[3:32:57.680 --> 3:33:00.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:33:00.520 --> 3:33:04.120]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:08.240 --> 3:33:10.800]  It requires a change in outlook,
[3:33:10.800 --> 3:33:14.360]  a change in tactics, a change in missions
[3:33:14.360 --> 3:33:16.920]  by the government, by the people,
[3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:19.480]  by every businessman or labor leader,
[3:33:19.480 --> 3:33:21.560]  and by every newspaper.
[3:33:21.560 --> 3:33:24.280]  For we are opposed around the world
[3:33:24.280 --> 3:33:27.800]  by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
[3:33:27.800 --> 3:33:31.080]  that relies primarily on covet means
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:33.760]  for expanding its sphere of influence,
[3:33:33.760 --> 3:33:37.160]  on infiltration instead of invasion,
[3:33:37.160 --> 3:33:40.320]  on subversion instead of elections,
[3:33:40.320 --> 3:33:43.840]  on intimidation instead of free choice,
[3:33:43.840 --> 3:33:48.200]  on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.
[3:33:48.200 --> 3:33:51.160]  It is a system which has conscripted
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:54.160]  vast human and material resources
[3:33:54.160 --> 3:33:56.520]  into the building of a tightly knit,
[3:33:56.520 --> 3:34:00.560]  highly efficient machine that combines military,
[3:34:00.560 --> 3:34:05.000]  diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific,
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:07.120]  and political operations.
[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:10.560]  Its preparations are concealed, not published.
[3:34:10.560 --> 3:34:13.840]  Its mistakes are buried, not headlined.
[3:34:13.840 --> 3:34:17.360]  Its dissenters are silenced, not praised.
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:21.080]  No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed,
[3:34:21.080 --> 3:34:22.560]  no secret is revealed.
[3:34:27.880 --> 3:34:31.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, entity himself.
[3:34:31.680 --> 3:34:35.560]  So, you know, when you see this narrative
[3:34:35.560 --> 3:34:38.080]  that all of these people who have started to speak out
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:40.160]  against this establishment across,
[3:34:40.160 --> 3:34:43.120]  you know, this globalist establishment,
[3:34:44.880 --> 3:34:47.240]  one common thread, they're all crazy.
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:34:48.640]  They're all conspiracy theorists.
[3:34:48.640 --> 3:34:51.120]  Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:34:53.040]  Steve Bannon is a conspiracy theorist.
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:55.800]  The minister Louis Farrakhan is a conspiracy theorist.
[3:34:55.800 --> 3:34:58.200]  Now Kanye West is a conspiracy theorist.
[3:34:58.200 --> 3:35:02.080]  Kyrie Irving is, and the list goes on and on and on and on.
[3:35:02.080 --> 3:35:04.520]  And you know, these people mean to mock you.
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:07.560]  You gotta understand that it's not enough for Satan
[3:35:07.560 --> 3:35:12.240]  to be able to pull you in to evil and wickedness.
[3:35:12.240 --> 3:35:15.040]  The ability to be able to mock you as he does it
[3:35:15.040 --> 3:35:17.880]  is just as valuable, just as satisfying.
[3:35:17.880 --> 3:35:19.080]  And that's what they've set up.
[3:35:19.080 --> 3:35:21.920]  They've set up a society where people are so worried
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:25.640]  or concerned or busyed with their own physical lusts
[3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:28.960]  and passion with jerking off and getting high.
[3:35:28.960 --> 3:35:30.480]  Let's just be honest.
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:34.000]  That they can mock you as they lie to you.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:39.040]  They actually have people believing that all of these ideas
[3:35:39.040 --> 3:35:41.000]  are conspiracy theories.
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:43.680]  Well, here's JFK, somebody who they actually idolize
[3:35:43.680 --> 3:35:45.520]  or who they say they idolize in any way.
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:48.640]  They treat him as he's an iconic political figure.
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:35:49.560]  And he comes right on and say,
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:52.400]  there's a ruthless and monolithic conspiracy.
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:55.960]  Now, if you accept that there's a ruthless
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:35:58.240]  and monolithic conspiracy, where do we go from there?
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:02.800]  Well, okay, it's widely accepted that JFK in that speech
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:05.640]  was talking about the threat of communism.
[3:36:05.640 --> 3:36:07.600]  And I tend to agree with that,
[3:36:07.600 --> 3:36:10.080]  although you can make the case that he may have
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:12.360]  actually been talking about New World Order
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:16.720]  and the prominence of a communist sort of ethos
[3:36:16.720 --> 3:36:20.800]  or spirit that is driving the New World Order.
[3:36:21.600 --> 3:36:22.960]  But in the same speech,
[3:36:22.960 --> 3:36:26.360]  he also made reference to the military industrial complex.
[3:36:26.360 --> 3:36:30.280]  And he warned that in trying to fight the communist threat,
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:32.240]  we would be unwise.
[3:36:32.240 --> 3:36:35.000]  We would be idiots to give up our freedom
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:38.240]  to a surveillance state in order to combat
[3:36:38.240 --> 3:36:39.240]  that communist threat.
[3:36:39.240 --> 3:36:42.560]  So he was very, very aware, very conscious
[3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:45.080]  and very unabashed and outspoken
[3:36:45.080 --> 3:36:47.560]  about his fear of the military industrial complex
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:49.320]  on our own side of the world,
[3:36:49.320 --> 3:36:53.640]  basically swallowing up the whole fish
[3:36:53.640 --> 3:36:56.360]  in any effort to throw communism.
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:37:01.080]  And let's take communism and go back a second
[3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:04.920]  because we know we live in a society
[3:37:04.920 --> 3:37:06.920]  where communism is at our door,
[3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:11.080]  despite what the neoliberal mainstream media
[3:37:11.080 --> 3:37:13.440]  establishment machine tries to tell us.
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:16.680]  We know that the ideals of communism are right
[3:37:16.680 --> 3:37:17.520]  at our doorstep.
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:19.080]  In fact, they're not at our doorstep.
[3:37:19.080 --> 3:37:22.560]  They're in our homes and the policies are in our homes.
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:26.360]  And we don't have, look, there's the tacit,
[3:37:26.360 --> 3:37:30.480]  there's the tacit truth that we aspire to be China.
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:35.040]  That we see nothing wrong with this sort of communist,
[3:37:35.040 --> 3:37:40.040]  totalitarian government style of organization.
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:43.000]  I mean, all of many of our political leaders,
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:44.920]  they openly gawk over China
[3:37:44.920 --> 3:37:46.520]  and what they've been able to accomplish
[3:37:46.520 --> 3:37:49.080]  through communist authoritarian means.
[3:37:49.080 --> 3:37:50.720]  But let's go a layer deeper.
[3:37:52.200 --> 3:37:56.240]  70% of our college professors identify as Marxists.
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:37:58.840]  And when you talk about communism
[3:37:58.840 --> 3:38:02.360]  or when people talk about communism or socialism,
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:04.560]  many times they leave out that communism
[3:38:04.560 --> 3:38:06.600]  derived directly from Marx.
[3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:08.560]  And they make the argument that people lived
[3:38:08.560 --> 3:38:12.320]  in a commune way before Marx
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:14.200]  in other places around the world.
[3:38:14.200 --> 3:38:16.560]  But that's dishonest to begin with,
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:19.520]  because the communism that was bred and derived
[3:38:19.520 --> 3:38:22.720]  from Karl Marx is the communism that is responsible
[3:38:22.720 --> 3:38:24.560]  for hundreds of millions of deaths
[3:38:24.560 --> 3:38:26.840]  in multiple places around the world.
[3:38:26.840 --> 3:38:29.760]  And so why is it that people fail
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:34.760]  to identify Karl Marx with communism?
[3:38:34.880 --> 3:38:37.000]  And to take it a level deeper,
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:39.200]  to circle back to the last segment,
[3:38:39.200 --> 3:38:42.760]  why is it that we can't talk about the fact
[3:38:42.760 --> 3:38:44.600]  that Karl Marx was a Jew?
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:48.720]  And again, Karl Marx wasn't a Jew, he's an anti-Jew,
[3:38:48.720 --> 3:38:53.400]  but that's a distinction that I'm making in the here and now.
[3:38:53.400 --> 3:38:58.160]  Karl Marx is somebody who historically was born into
[3:38:58.160 --> 3:39:00.720]  a patril lineage of rabbis,
[3:39:00.720 --> 3:39:02.960]  and his father converted to Christianity
[3:39:02.960 --> 3:39:04.440]  to assimilate in the times,
[3:39:04.440 --> 3:39:06.760]  and then he completely rejected God.
[3:39:06.760 --> 3:39:08.200]  And like I said on the last time,
[3:39:08.200 --> 3:39:10.240]  I was able to get guest hosts,
[3:39:10.240 --> 3:39:13.520]  liberalism, communism, and globalism all have the same aim,
[3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:15.640]  the removal of God from the organization of man.
[3:39:15.640 --> 3:39:16.560]  And when you do that,
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:18.840]  the government becomes the highest rule.
[3:39:18.840 --> 3:39:19.680]  And you can see that,
[3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:21.720]  you can see that with their efforts.
[3:39:21.720 --> 3:39:25.440]  And there are people out there who want you to believe
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:29.480]  that any inference that liberalism, communism,
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:31.800]  and globalism are working in accordance
[3:39:31.800 --> 3:39:34.720]  across our society is completely crazy.
[3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:36.600]  But look at the evidence.
[3:39:36.600 --> 3:39:39.160]  Look at the neoliberal machine that was erected
[3:39:39.160 --> 3:39:42.920]  in the post-higher learning education system
[3:39:42.920 --> 3:39:47.000]  that came to be infiltrated with Marxist professors,
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:50.600]  and look at the dragon in the east
[3:39:50.600 --> 3:39:52.280]  that both have come to serve.
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:57.280]  Or you could say that the crown in Europe
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:39:59.320]  that we still serve,
[3:39:59.320 --> 3:40:02.600]  and let's circle back to Zionism.
[3:40:03.600 --> 3:40:06.520]  And of course this might get me de-platformed,
[3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:07.600]  a band or whatever.
[3:40:07.600 --> 3:40:09.160]  Okay, I mean, we're at that point now.
[3:40:09.160 --> 3:40:11.720]  We just gotta stop pulling punches.
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:14.160]  Okay, nobody's saying round up the Jews.
[3:40:14.160 --> 3:40:15.760]  Nobody's saying round up anybody.
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:17.960]  If anything, I'm gonna call for a truth commission
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:20.440]  so we can figure out what actually happened here.
[3:40:20.440 --> 3:40:22.240]  How did we get to this place?
[3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:24.040]  Because most of what we're having to do
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:28.320]  is piece together information with huge gaps in it.
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:29.160]  Why?
[3:40:29.160 --> 3:40:30.680]  Because like Kennedy said,
[3:40:30.680 --> 3:40:34.880]  these initiatives were done in secret.
[3:40:34.880 --> 3:40:37.920]  It's monolithic and ruthless conspiracy.
[3:40:37.920 --> 3:40:41.000]  But let's go to the Zionism question.
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:43.080]  Many of the black hats in Israel,
[3:40:43.080 --> 3:40:44.880]  and many of the black hats around the world,
[3:40:44.880 --> 3:40:47.840]  the observant, faithful Jews, the real Jews,
[3:40:47.840 --> 3:40:49.880]  the Jews that I call Ken,
[3:40:49.880 --> 3:40:53.800]  these people are openly,
[3:40:53.800 --> 3:40:55.920]  openly in admittance,
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:40:59.760]  openly admit that Zionism itself is a rejection of God.
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:03.840]  Now, I believe in the preservation of Israel.
[3:41:03.840 --> 3:41:07.760]  I don't think that what's happened there since 1949
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:11.400]  is okay.
[3:41:11.400 --> 3:41:12.760]  And you can make the argument
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:14.760]  that the inception of Israel itself
[3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:18.400]  was illegitimate on a geopolitical basis.
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:20.360]  But Israel should stay,
[3:41:20.360 --> 3:41:21.720]  because it's been there for 60 years.
[3:41:21.720 --> 3:41:24.280]  We have to deal with things where they are.
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:28.000]  But let's be honest, Zionism is a rejection of God.
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:32.280]  Zionism is a rejection of the Jewish identity,
[3:41:32.280 --> 3:41:34.600]  the Jewish ethno-religious identity
[3:41:34.600 --> 3:41:38.680]  that they cling to in a post-World War II context.
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:40.280]  And if we talk about Zionism,
[3:41:40.280 --> 3:41:42.080]  and if we talk about the Jewish identity
[3:41:42.080 --> 3:41:44.200]  or the anti-Jew identity,
[3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:46.480]  let's go back to the Sinequanon.
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:48.680]  Let's go back to the banking and the Rothschilds
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:51.760]  and the crown.
[3:41:51.760 --> 3:41:53.360]  Nobody wants you to be able to talk about it.
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:54.640]  You can't talk about that.
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:41:56.320]  They treat it as though the Rothschilds
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:41:59.640]  are a mythological beast,
[3:41:59.640 --> 3:42:02.400]  like they're a unicorn or a sash-wash.
[3:42:02.400 --> 3:42:03.240]  They're not.
[3:42:03.240 --> 3:42:04.840]  There's a Rothschild that's alive today.
[3:42:04.840 --> 3:42:05.680]  You know what I mean?
[3:42:05.680 --> 3:42:07.720]  Dave Rothschild is still living to this day.
[3:42:07.720 --> 3:42:09.200]  And he's still in the same spot
[3:42:09.200 --> 3:42:11.200]  of the financial institution that he's always been in
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:13.120]  and that his family has always been in.
[3:42:13.120 --> 3:42:15.920]  And their wealth is unquantifiable.
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:17.800]  And they've sat in service to the crown,
[3:42:17.800 --> 3:42:20.440]  which they were initially instituted to be in service of,
[3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:22.800]  or the monarchy, the European monarchies.
[3:42:22.800 --> 3:42:25.560]  And yeah, and who was,
[3:42:25.560 --> 3:42:28.160]  and who, we talk about the crown,
[3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:30.520]  the Freemasons, another conspiracy theory.
[3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:31.560]  Really?
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:33.640]  Really, go look at the Grand United Lodge right now.
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:36.080]  Who's the grandmaster of the Grand United Lodge?
[3:42:36.080 --> 3:42:37.280]  Prince Edward of Kent.
[3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:41.000]  It's not by accident that the Freemasonry
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:44.400]  and the international Zionist conspiracy
[3:42:44.400 --> 3:42:47.680]  is regarded as a conspiracy theory from the outset.
[3:42:47.680 --> 3:42:48.800]  We're gonna talk more about this
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:50.800]  on the other side of the break,
[3:42:50.800 --> 3:42:53.840]  but have to get to this.
[3:42:53.840 --> 3:42:54.680]  Thank you.
[3:42:56.800 --> 3:42:59.280]  Don't let the globalist monsters
[3:42:59.280 --> 3:43:01.440]  and their mercenary minions be successful
[3:43:01.440 --> 3:43:03.560]  at silencing you.
[3:43:03.560 --> 3:43:05.040]  And the globalist number one mission
[3:43:05.040 --> 3:43:06.640]  is to silence info wars,
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:09.320]  because they rightly cease as one of the main beacons
[3:43:09.320 --> 3:43:11.400]  of resistance alerting the people,
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:13.400]  not as of America, but the world,
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:15.040]  to the threat of the globalist
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:17.240]  and their censorship and tyranny.
[3:43:17.240 --> 3:43:19.960]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever,
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:22.760]  to share links from info wars.com
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:25.480]  and to also financially support info wars.com

[3:43:44.560 --> 3:43:46.360]  but I could give out without your support.

[3:44:17.480 --> 3:44:18.440]  and I thank you.
[3:44:18.440 --> 3:44:20.720]  But now, I have my own legal bills
[3:44:20.720 --> 3:44:22.920]  that have reached the point that I can't pay them,

[3:45:03.320 --> 3:45:07.440]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[3:45:07.440 --> 3:45:12.440]  that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[3:45:12.520 --> 3:45:15.000]  They know the truth about their globalist operations
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:16.920]  is exposed, it's came over.
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:20.400]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:22.640]  and peacefully fighting back.

[3:45:59.880 --> 3:46:02.440]  It's the bad halogen to the same family
[3:46:02.440 --> 3:46:05.360]  as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[3:46:05.360 --> 3:46:07.040]  What's the good halogen?
[3:46:07.040 --> 3:46:09.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[3:46:57.640 --> 3:47:00.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:47:00.480 --> 3:47:04.080]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:07.560 --> 3:47:12.560]  Okay, while we're on the topic of promotion,
[3:47:17.080 --> 3:47:19.960]  why did you decide to promote something
[3:47:19.960 --> 3:47:21.480]  that Alex Jones said?
[3:47:23.080 --> 3:47:24.720]  That was a few weeks ago.
[3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:29.720]  I do not stand with Alex Jones position, narrative,
[3:47:29.720 --> 3:47:32.120]  court case that he had with Sandy Hook
[3:47:32.120 --> 3:47:36.120]  or any of the kids that felt like they had to relive trauma
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:38.320]  or parents that had to relive trauma
[3:47:38.320 --> 3:47:40.000]  or to be dismissive to all the lives
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:43.240]  that were lost during that tragic event.
[3:47:44.200 --> 3:47:47.040]  My post was a post from Alex Jones that he did
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:49.680]  in the early 90s or late 90s about secret societies
[3:47:49.680 --> 3:47:53.440]  in America of occult and it's true.
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:56.440]  So I wasn't identifying with anything
[3:47:56.440 --> 3:47:59.800]  of being a campaignist for Alex Jones or anything,
[3:47:59.800 --> 3:48:01.520]  which is there to post.
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:03.920]  And it's funny, and it's actually hilarious
[3:48:03.920 --> 3:48:05.360]  because out of all the things I posted that day,
[3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:09.000]  that was the most post that everyone chose to see.
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:12.040]  It just goes back to the way our world is and works.
[3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:14.680]  I'm not here to complain about it, I just exist.
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:17.440]  And to follow up on the promotion
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:20.000]  of the movie and the book.
[3:48:20.000 --> 3:48:21.880]  Can you please stop calling her a promotion?
[3:48:21.880 --> 3:48:22.880]  What am I promoting?
[3:48:23.960 --> 3:48:25.320]  Put it out on your platform.
[3:48:25.320 --> 3:48:26.520]  But I'm promoting it?
[3:48:26.520 --> 3:48:29.040]  Do you see me doing, do you see it in front of the title?
[3:48:29.040 --> 3:48:30.600]  People are gonna say that you are promoting it.
[3:48:30.600 --> 3:48:31.600]  Yeah, put it out there, just like you
[3:48:31.600 --> 3:48:32.800]  put things out there, right?
[3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:33.640]  Yeah, but I, it's not.
[3:48:33.640 --> 3:48:35.680]  Okay, you put things out there for a living, right?
[3:48:35.680 --> 3:48:39.600]  Right, but my stuff is not filled with anti-Semitic stuff.
[3:48:39.600 --> 3:48:41.840]  Let's move on, don't dehumanize me up here.
[3:48:41.840 --> 3:48:45.040]  I'm not doing that, you're free to post whatever I want.
[3:48:45.040 --> 3:48:47.920]  So say that and shut it down and move on to the next question.
[3:48:47.920 --> 3:48:49.360]  But Kyrie, you have to understand that
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:51.360]  I don't have to understand anything from you.
[3:48:51.360 --> 3:48:52.200]  It's not me.
[3:48:52.200 --> 3:48:54.200]  Nothing, it's no people that you're making up, bro.
[3:48:54.200 --> 3:48:55.040]  Move on.
[3:48:55.040 --> 3:48:56.040]  So I posted what you did.
[3:48:56.040 --> 3:48:56.880]  Move on, next question.
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:48:59.600]  Anybody who's gonna look at it, and they're gonna say.
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:00.920]  You guys have any more questions?
[3:49:00.920 --> 3:49:01.960]  Because this is gonna be a clip.
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:04.120]  This is gonna be a clip that he's gonna marvel at.
[3:49:04.120 --> 3:49:05.320]  Is this any more questions?
[3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:07.080]  But you're not answering the question.
[3:49:07.080 --> 3:49:08.280]  There's another answering your question.
[3:49:08.280 --> 3:49:10.120]  Oh my God, let's make another Instagram clip
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:11.600]  so we could be famous again.
[3:49:11.600 --> 3:49:12.440]  Next question.
[3:49:12.440 --> 3:49:13.960]  Kyrie, basketball reliever.
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:18.800]  That's awesome.
[3:49:18.800 --> 3:49:21.360]  Kyrie Irving, what a hero.
[3:49:21.360 --> 3:49:22.520]  I mean, you know,
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:26.400]  it's incredible.
[3:49:26.400 --> 3:49:30.320]  It's incredible that he has the courage.
[3:49:30.320 --> 3:49:31.960]  And maybe I shouldn't say it's incredible.
[3:49:31.960 --> 3:49:33.480]  Maybe it's just rare,
[3:49:33.480 --> 3:49:36.480]  because the times make the warrior.
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:38.920]  But it's certainly impressive
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:40.760]  that he had the courage to just stand up there
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:42.640]  under that line of questioning and say,
[3:49:42.640 --> 3:49:45.960]  yeah, I was referencing the Alex Jones video from 2002
[3:49:45.960 --> 3:49:48.360]  about secret societies and occults.
[3:49:48.360 --> 3:49:50.440]  And it's true.
[3:49:50.440 --> 3:49:54.280]  And, you know, I know Kyrie personally a little bit
[3:49:54.280 --> 3:49:57.360]  and he's somebody who is definitely trying to see
[3:49:57.360 --> 3:50:01.080]  beyond the veil and is willing to speak out on these issues
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:02.520]  and has continued to show that he's willing
[3:50:02.520 --> 3:50:04.000]  to speak out on these issues.
[3:50:05.240 --> 3:50:09.040]  Now, I hope for and I hope to be able to facilitate
[3:50:09.040 --> 3:50:11.160]  him getting to know Alex Jones a little bit better
[3:50:11.160 --> 3:50:12.640]  or meeting Alex Jones at some point,
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:15.440]  maybe coming on the show or something of that sort
[3:50:15.440 --> 3:50:17.000]  so that he could understand
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:20.600]  who Alex Jones really is in totality.
[3:50:20.600 --> 3:50:23.120]  What Alex Jones has come to represent
[3:50:23.120 --> 3:50:26.640]  in the world of information in the most broadest sense,
[3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:29.240]  not just around that one particular video,
[3:50:29.240 --> 3:50:31.560]  because that one particular video,
[3:50:31.560 --> 3:50:33.760]  obviously for all of us who are a part
[3:50:33.760 --> 3:50:36.680]  of the Info Wars audience and the Info War family
[3:50:36.680 --> 3:50:39.320]  knows that that's what Alex Jones has represented
[3:50:40.680 --> 3:50:43.920]  or the vast majority of his time on the air.
[3:50:43.920 --> 3:50:45.920]  And yeah, they wanna take the few mistakes
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:47.320]  that you make and use that to hang,
[3:50:47.320 --> 3:50:50.560]  string you up on a cross, that's biblical,
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:50:52.640]  but we know the truth.
[3:50:52.640 --> 3:50:54.600]  And I'm glad that Kyrie's speaking out on it,
[3:50:54.600 --> 3:50:58.120]  but right there towards the end,
[3:50:58.120 --> 3:51:00.920]  you heard them pop it off, that's anti-Semitic.
[3:51:00.920 --> 3:51:02.800]  And obviously he was referencing from,
[3:51:02.800 --> 3:51:04.680]  I think it was from, what's it from,
[3:51:04.680 --> 3:51:07.520]  Hebrews to slaves, from slaves to Hebrews
[3:51:07.520 --> 3:51:10.000]  or something like some black Israelite documentary
[3:51:10.000 --> 3:51:14.440]  that I didn't watch it really,
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:16.320]  because it just wasn't that good to me,
[3:51:16.320 --> 3:51:20.560]  but the point is, is why can't he have the conversation?
[3:51:20.560 --> 3:51:23.760]  Why can't he pose the question?
[3:51:23.760 --> 3:51:27.360]  Who gets to say what we can and can't talk about?
[3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:28.800]  This is America.
[3:51:28.800 --> 3:51:31.120]  This is a country based upon free speech.
[3:51:31.120 --> 3:51:36.120]  This is a country based upon the convincing of people
[3:51:38.120 --> 3:51:42.320]  with the convincing of others of our ideas
[3:51:42.320 --> 3:51:45.240]  with oratory composition, right?
[3:51:45.240 --> 3:51:49.240]  A dialectical progression of thought.
[3:51:49.240 --> 3:51:52.840]  Who are these people who say that we can't ask
[3:51:52.840 --> 3:51:55.960]  certain questions or we can't say certain words
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:51:58.600]  or we can't mention certain parts of history?
[3:51:59.640 --> 3:52:03.920]  And now, again, why is this conversation
[3:52:03.920 --> 3:52:07.800]  about Jew versus anti-Jew so important?
[3:52:07.800 --> 3:52:12.440]  Is it because the Jews are the only people behind
[3:52:12.440 --> 3:52:16.320]  this entire global circumstance?
[3:52:16.320 --> 3:52:19.800]  Of course not, but nobody reasonable with saying that.
[3:52:19.800 --> 3:52:24.280]  And the attempt to make it seem like anybody who mentions
[3:52:24.280 --> 3:52:26.880]  any conversation about the Jewish elite,
[3:52:26.880 --> 3:52:30.560]  the anti-Jewish secular elite in pro sports
[3:52:30.560 --> 3:52:34.120]  or in America or in Hollywood or in banking,
[3:52:34.120 --> 3:52:36.160]  they're just showing themselves to be shields
[3:52:36.160 --> 3:52:38.800]  for the very movement that they're trying to rope off.
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:41.280]  And they make it worse because the immediate question
[3:52:41.280 --> 3:52:44.640]  that any reasonable saying American citizens gonna have
[3:52:44.640 --> 3:52:48.440]  is why can't I ask this question, right?
[3:52:48.440 --> 3:52:51.760]  And like I said before, and like Kyrie is alluding to,
[3:52:51.760 --> 3:52:54.480]  he said, don't dehumanize me up here.
[3:52:54.480 --> 3:52:57.560]  Why is it that you think that you can just cut me off
[3:52:57.560 --> 3:53:00.000]  and not even allow me the chance to answer the question
[3:53:00.000 --> 3:53:02.280]  that you've asked, you know?
[3:53:02.280 --> 3:53:06.680]  And these white liberals and the people who have come up
[3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:08.760]  under this white liberalism, you know,
[3:53:08.760 --> 3:53:11.200]  they show that sort of grandiosity,
[3:53:11.200 --> 3:53:15.840]  that sort of superiority complex when they're in these
[3:53:15.840 --> 3:53:19.280]  conversations about political ideas or political issues.
[3:53:19.280 --> 3:53:21.960]  And that's exactly what he tried to do to Kyrie Irving
[3:53:21.960 --> 3:53:22.960]  in that instance.
[3:53:22.960 --> 3:53:26.480]  And Kyrie just, you know, he just basically deboned them
[3:53:26.480 --> 3:53:28.240]  and said, hey, hey, next question.
[3:53:28.240 --> 3:53:30.520]  I got the microphone, I'm in control up here.
[3:53:30.520 --> 3:53:32.480]  I'm Kyrie Irving, who are you?
[3:53:32.480 --> 3:53:34.000]  And I love that, I love that.
[3:53:34.000 --> 3:53:36.000]  I think more people need to stand up like that
[3:53:36.000 --> 3:53:40.120]  and stop letting these mainstream media shields bully them.
[3:53:40.120 --> 3:53:44.120]  But to go back to this, so I went to go,
[3:53:44.120 --> 3:53:47.800]  I went to got to thinking and I'm sitting at home
[3:53:47.800 --> 3:53:51.680]  and I'm going, if we're talking about masonry, right,
[3:53:51.680 --> 3:53:54.640]  which is the oldest secret society on record now,
[3:53:54.640 --> 3:53:56.240]  this isn't a conspiracy theory.
[3:53:56.240 --> 3:54:01.240]  They're the oldest secret society that we know of today
[3:54:02.200 --> 3:54:03.680]  that's in public existence.
[3:54:04.840 --> 3:54:06.400]  So I started thinking about Freemasonry
[3:54:06.400 --> 3:54:08.280]  and this whole conversation about conspiracy
[3:54:08.280 --> 3:54:10.680]  and it dawned on me that Solomon's temple
[3:54:10.680 --> 3:54:14.960]  or the admiration of the great pyramid of Giza
[3:54:15.800 --> 3:54:20.800]  is not an admiration of master building or craft.
[3:54:21.880 --> 3:54:24.960]  It's an admiration of slavery.
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:26.400]  And then right away, you'll hear people say,
[3:54:26.400 --> 3:54:29.800]  oh, the pyramids weren't built by slaves,
[3:54:29.800 --> 3:54:31.320]  that's been debunked.
[3:54:31.320 --> 3:54:34.240]  The pyramids were built by 44 farmers
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:35.480]  who couldn't farm their land.
[3:54:35.480 --> 3:54:39.320]  So they had the time to be independently contracted
[3:54:39.320 --> 3:54:43.240]  to build the pyramids, another anti-Jew story,
[3:54:43.240 --> 3:54:46.160]  another way to invalidate the exodus from Egypt,
[3:54:46.160 --> 3:54:49.960]  which is really the central motif in the Torah.
[3:54:49.960 --> 3:54:52.160]  It's really the central idea of the Jewish faith
[3:54:52.160 --> 3:54:55.240]  that God's people had favor and a promise from the days
[3:54:55.240 --> 3:54:58.480]  of the covenant with Abraham and that it was fulfilled
[3:54:58.480 --> 3:55:03.480]  when Moses rose up and came from within the elite
[3:55:04.040 --> 3:55:07.640]  and stood with his people out there in the slums
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:11.440]  and liberated his people from a tyrannical Egypt.
[3:55:11.440 --> 3:55:14.920]  But nowadays, even these secular anti-Jews go off,
[3:55:14.920 --> 3:55:17.280]  no, the pyramids weren't built by Jews slaves,
[3:55:17.280 --> 3:55:19.800]  that's a lie, that's not historically true.
[3:55:19.800 --> 3:55:22.400]  And you got black people who shield for the same argument
[3:55:22.400 --> 3:55:25.040]  and you got these white LGBTQ phenocles
[3:55:25.040 --> 3:55:26.400]  who shield for the same argument
[3:55:26.400 --> 3:55:29.040]  and radical feminists who don't even,
[3:55:29.040 --> 3:55:31.240]  who've never read anything in their life,
[3:55:31.240 --> 3:55:33.800]  much less anything substantive or historical.
[3:55:33.800 --> 3:55:36.600]  They might read about the latest relationship gossip
[3:55:36.600 --> 3:55:39.040]  between Kanye and Kim K,
[3:55:39.040 --> 3:55:42.640]  but they're not reading anything in historical,
[3:55:42.640 --> 3:55:44.280]  definitely not outside of the bastion
[3:55:44.280 --> 3:55:46.520]  of Marxist college material.
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:49.060]  They're all saying that this isn't even true.
[3:55:49.060 --> 3:55:49.900]  What are they doing?
[3:55:49.900 --> 3:55:54.900]  They're delegitimizing one of the central pieces
[3:55:55.880 --> 3:55:58.920]  of cultural identity that the real Jews
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:01.500]  have carried across 5,000 years.
[3:56:01.500 --> 3:56:03.160]  That's anti-Semitic.
[3:56:03.160 --> 3:56:06.000]  I mean, to take what a people have written
[3:56:06.000 --> 3:56:10.560]  and passed down for 5,000 years and go, that's a lie,
[3:56:10.560 --> 3:56:12.640]  that's just garbage.
[3:56:12.640 --> 3:56:14.880]  I mean, doesn't get any more anti-Semitic than that.
[3:56:14.880 --> 3:56:17.520]  I mean, there are people who take real criticism
[3:56:17.520 --> 3:56:22.280]  or even questioning, you know, let's say the music
[3:56:22.280 --> 3:56:24.760]  from black rappers and they go and people will say,
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:27.680]  hey, you don't get to question that, that's there are.
[3:56:28.680 --> 3:56:31.640]  Are you anti-black or are you racist?
[3:56:31.640 --> 3:56:32.920]  But you can take the Torah
[3:56:32.920 --> 3:56:35.840]  and completely erase it from history at will.
[3:56:35.840 --> 3:56:38.920]  Okay, why are we even talking about this?
[3:56:38.920 --> 3:56:41.720]  Because there are no people who we can't
[3:56:41.720 --> 3:56:43.680]  or shouldn't be able to talk about
[3:56:43.680 --> 3:56:45.640]  in a cultural and political context
[3:56:45.640 --> 3:56:49.360]  to diagnose where we are here in society now.
[3:56:49.360 --> 3:56:52.840]  And we are in a crisis and it is a monolithic
[3:56:52.840 --> 3:56:55.960]  and ruthless conspiracy that we do need to diagnose
[3:56:55.960 --> 3:56:57.840]  and we need every tool possible
[3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:01.520]  to be able to uncover the secrets that lie therein.
[3:57:01.520 --> 3:57:04.840]  And it's not just the Jews, the anti-Jews.
[3:57:04.840 --> 3:57:07.480]  I have just as many questions about the crown
[3:57:07.480 --> 3:57:08.800]  and about the masons.
[3:57:08.800 --> 3:57:10.060]  And I have just as many questions
[3:57:10.060 --> 3:57:12.320]  about their relationship with China
[3:57:12.320 --> 3:57:14.180]  or their acceptance of China
[3:57:14.180 --> 3:57:16.280]  or maybe a war in secret
[3:57:16.280 --> 3:57:19.920]  that we don't quite see going on between them in China
[3:57:19.920 --> 3:57:23.040]  which is one of the oldest wars, the opium war.
[3:57:23.040 --> 3:57:24.880]  All of these things have come into question.
[3:57:24.880 --> 3:57:27.320]  All of these things need to continue to be questioned.
[3:57:27.320 --> 3:57:30.560]  Thank you to Alex Jones and the M4 Wars team
[3:57:30.560 --> 3:57:32.560]  and family for allowing me to host.

[3:58:44.440 --> 3:58:49.440]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[3:58:49.440 --> 3:58:53.440]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[3:58:53.440 --> 3:58:55.840]  not just in America, but the world.
[3:58:55.840 --> 3:58:59.320]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range
[3:58:59.320 --> 3:59:02.720]  in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[3:59:02.720 --> 3:59:05.720]  Yes, I've personally been in the globalist
[3:59:05.720 --> 3:59:07.440]  but yes, I've persevered.
[3:59:07.440 --> 3:59:10.360]  But the listeners and viewers who support M4Wars
[3:59:10.360 --> 3:59:13.160]  are the real reason you've had the success.
[3:59:13.160 --> 3:59:15.400]  We're having now the greatest victories
[3:59:15.400 --> 3:59:18.560]  in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[3:59:18.560 --> 3:59:22.880]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[3:59:22.880 --> 3:59:25.960]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[3:59:25.960 --> 3:59:28.160]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[3:59:28.160 --> 3:59:30.760]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out
[3:59:30.760 --> 3:59:32.120]  and to intensify them.
[3:59:32.120 --> 3:59:33.440]  God bless you all.
[3:59:33.440 --> 3:59:34.480]  I salute you.
[3:59:34.480 --> 3:59:35.520]  I thank you.
[3:59:35.520 --> 3:59:38.520]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[3:59:38.520 --> 3:59:41.680]  because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[3:59:41.680 --> 3:59:42.960]  The fight is my fight.
[3:59:42.960 --> 3:59:43.800]  It's your fight.
[3:59:43.800 --> 3:59:44.640]  It's our fight.
