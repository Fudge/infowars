[00:00.000 --> 00:16.860]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:16.860 --> 00:25.980]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:25.980 --> 00:36.660]  training wheels are coming off going out of beta into operational and so you can
[00:36.660 --> 00:40.320]  just wait and see if I'm right again this time or you can go read what they're
[00:40.320 --> 00:44.720]  doing and what they're saying look at this headline from zero hedge and it
[00:44.720 --> 00:49.960]  directly links to a Pentagon paper that is official US government policy and
[00:49.960 --> 00:56.700]  also official NATO policy this has been adopted as a sixth sphere of warfare
[00:56.700 --> 01:01.740]  hacking your brain is what they call it and they call it full-spectrum dominance
[01:01.740 --> 01:09.180]  they also call it propaganda and mind control on a mass scale cognitive
[01:09.180 --> 01:15.060]  warfare a battle for the brain this is an actual government document this is all
[01:15.060 --> 01:19.540]  being externalized now because this is 25 30 years old this has been
[01:19.540 --> 01:25.060]  implemented a long time ago under George Herbert Walker Bush and then the
[01:25.060 --> 01:30.820]  Clintons and now it's fully operational right now they're out of beta the brain
[01:30.820 --> 01:34.620]  will be the battle filled the 21st century talk about war on for your mind
[01:34.620 --> 01:39.860]  battles are increasingly being fought without bullets but instead ideas wars
[01:39.860 --> 01:46.260]  now entering a new frontier the mind cognitive warfare is a new type of
[01:46.260 --> 01:50.940]  warfare defined as the weaponization of public opinion by an external entity
[01:50.940 --> 01:56.980]  for the purpose of influencing and or destabilizing a nation we can visualize
[01:56.980 --> 02:01.900]  these attacks as a matrix spanning the few in the many and influencing thought
[02:01.900 --> 02:06.180]  in action the targets of cognitive warfare attacks may range from whole
[02:06.180 --> 02:12.060]  populations to individual leaders across communities and organizations these
[02:12.060 --> 02:16.220]  attacks seek to change or reinforce thoughts influencing or confirming how
[02:16.220 --> 02:20.500]  people think and then affect real-world action as we've seen attacks on the
[02:20.500 --> 02:24.580]  mind instigate physical conflict and impact elections we all know what
[02:24.580 --> 02:29.700]  physical security is it's protecting ourselves physically cognitive security
[02:29.700 --> 02:34.260]  is how do you actually protect our minds so cognitive insecurity is basically
[02:34.260 --> 02:38.580]  when there are flaws in our own cognitive security so it's it typically
[02:38.580 --> 02:42.500]  exists due to carelessness just not even caring could be also that someone's
[02:42.500 --> 02:47.900]  naive their innocent could be that they have a target identity weakness which
[02:47.900 --> 02:52.820]  basically means that they're so they're so loyal to one identity that they become
[02:52.820 --> 02:58.300]  blind to the flaws information warfare is not new military deception
[02:58.300 --> 03:05.540]  psychological operations generate the the non-kinetic effects that generate an
[03:05.540 --> 03:10.100]  influence have been around since since biblical times what's new of course is
[03:10.100 --> 03:16.420]  the conduct of these activities in cyberspace and because of our increasing
[03:16.420 --> 03:21.820]  interconnectedness our increasing reliance on digital information and
[03:21.820 --> 03:28.220]  electronic devices in our everyday lives let alone for for commerce and and
[03:28.220 --> 03:34.380]  for security we are all active players now in the information environment and
[03:34.380 --> 03:37.740]  that's why people should be interested in information there's no there's no real
[03:37.740 --> 03:43.140]  deterrence from a defensive posture the deterrence comes from the ability to
[03:43.140 --> 03:49.260]  reach out and touch an adversary at a time and place of you choosing military
[03:49.260 --> 03:53.340]  leaders saw pandemic as unique opportunity to test propaganda techniques
[03:53.340 --> 03:59.100]  on Canadians forces report says and they gave a press conference how they
[03:59.100 --> 04:04.100]  scared you for your own good you don't have to listen to vice or listen to me
[04:04.100 --> 04:09.980]  you could go read the NATO and Pentagon and Canadian and and all the reports it's
[04:09.980 --> 04:15.820]  all the exact same stuff dividing you making you feel alone dividing people
[04:15.820 --> 04:21.140]  according to sexual lines and and and skin pigment all really nasty evil stuff
[04:21.140 --> 04:24.420]  and that's what this is have us all fight with each other and just hit us with
[04:24.420 --> 04:28.620]  the most poisonous propaganda about how we're all bad except Apple that owns the
[04:28.620 --> 04:31.980]  slave factories and suicide nets around them they're good because they they love
[04:31.980 --> 04:34.940]  black lives matter and have black spokespersons doesn't matter if they're
[04:34.940 --> 04:37.940]  running slave colonies around the world as long as they've got a black spokesperson
[04:37.940 --> 04:41.980]  it's okay you know Gigi pink and have death camps to I mean he's Asian so he
[04:41.980 --> 04:46.220]  can do no wrong because the bad people are the white people this is pure
[04:46.220 --> 04:50.260]  nightmare authoritarianism and and it's not just run by the Psiop people to
[04:50.260 --> 04:56.940]  Pentagon they're just legitimizing it through that I mean this is just insane
[04:56.940 --> 05:05.220]  Alex Jones here I am taping this update on the morning of Friday October 22nd
[05:05.220 --> 05:10.820]  2021 listeners who've already tried and really seen the powerful effects of
[05:10.820 --> 05:15.900]  Rainforest Ultra should be excited to know that we've got a limited supply of
[05:15.900 --> 05:20.140]  it in stock but it'll be sold out at current sales rates by Monday morning
[05:20.140 --> 05:25.340]  despite that fact we're still offering a major discount of 25% off it is an
[05:25.340 --> 05:29.300]  amazing new tropic I went to one of the top labs the country and I said I want
[05:29.300 --> 05:34.700]  very powerful quick acting extremely clean new tropic that wears off quick
[05:34.700 --> 05:37.780]  because I want to be able to take it if I've got to work till 10 at night take
[05:37.780 --> 05:42.780]  it at 7 and for it to wear off by 10 and that's exactly what they did with
[05:42.780 --> 05:46.860]  Rainforest Ultra now we have other great products like turbo force that last for
[05:46.860 --> 05:50.300]  10 hours it's a different formula it's over the top powerful so strong I can't
[05:50.300 --> 05:53.820]  even take it by the way it's sold out right now the Rainforest Ultra is really
[05:53.820 --> 05:58.260]  something special it's 25% off limited supply we'll sell out early next week
[05:58.260 --> 06:01.940]  info or store.com
[06:01.940 --> 06:28.740]  it is Tuesday October 26th 2021 I am your host Alex Jones and the quickening is
[06:28.740 --> 06:35.780]  upon us the quickening of the quickening I have a ton of governmental
[06:35.780 --> 06:41.140]  announcements and mainline studies and scientific reports that have just come
[06:41.140 --> 06:47.660]  together and what I would call a political cultural military economic
[06:47.660 --> 06:57.660]  biomechanical biomedical alignment and we have Dr. Richard Fleming who in the
[06:57.660 --> 07:02.820]  last few months went out he's a PhD MD and also a lawyer he holds a bunch of
[07:02.820 --> 07:07.940]  patents with different types of resonance machines so he's the top of his
[07:07.940 --> 07:16.540]  field he went out and hired some top lab doctors when the FDA would not answer
[07:16.540 --> 07:22.500]  his questions or give him any other raw data and they went and got Pfizer
[07:22.500 --> 07:29.940]  vaccines so-called vaccine for COVID-19 and they tested it themselves and
[07:29.940 --> 07:37.140]  they're gonna premiere the findings here today you did a 32 minute report
[07:37.140 --> 07:41.100]  yesterday that just went live today at mandat video because he's been censored
[07:41.100 --> 07:44.980]  so many places he decided to premiere it here because he has courage and so do
[07:44.980 --> 07:50.700]  we some birds with feather fly together I'll be joining us in the third hour but
[07:50.700 --> 07:54.820]  when you look at it that this is all under microscopes and under electron
[07:54.820 --> 08:00.420]  microscopes and then this is all done in professional official certified labs in
[08:00.420 --> 08:07.620]  vitro but we know what happens the average person is gonna have crystals
[08:07.620 --> 08:12.420]  slowly growing them and it's slowly gonna die a pry on type diseases and blood
[08:12.420 --> 08:17.740]  clots and 64% of people in test in Europe Canada in the US and Australia all
[08:17.740 --> 08:23.780]  at about 64% summer 62 summer 66 but the average is about 64% just type that in
[08:23.780 --> 08:29.700]  64% of those that take Pfizer shot get blood clots the D dimer test and they
[08:29.700 --> 08:34.420]  now had medical clinics around the world do the test and it's always above 62%
[08:34.420 --> 08:40.260]  very precise and within just a few points the D dimer shows you know they
[08:40.260 --> 08:45.020]  take they do a D dimer and they don't have blood clots they do a D dimer and
[08:45.020 --> 08:50.820]  within a few days 60 plus percent have blood clots so we know what's going on
[08:50.820 --> 08:55.580]  here ladies and gentlemen this is absolutely insane so they did these
[08:55.580 --> 08:59.340]  tests a bunch of them and they found a bunch of just like the Japanese
[08:59.340 --> 09:04.140]  government did metal particulates and other things in it the Japanese found
[09:04.140 --> 09:08.500]  it in the Moderna but he found it the Pfizer's it's in both others have found
[09:08.500 --> 09:12.300]  it Pfizer's as well but that wasn't the big issue that was bad enough that's
[09:12.300 --> 09:18.780]  enough to recall it it created a chain reaction within minutes that even other
[09:18.780 --> 09:25.260]  chemicals and things they tested didn't do saline solutions other things but when
[09:25.260 --> 09:30.700]  you pay put the Pfizer liquid from the mRNA Franken shot into a petri dish with
[09:30.700 --> 09:34.900]  fresh blood been drawn out of somebody's arm and put in it has a chain
[09:34.900 --> 09:38.620]  reaction in minutes turning it from bright red oxidated blood is red
[09:38.620 --> 09:45.100]  unoxygenated is blue into brown brick brown now what does that mean ladies and
[09:45.100 --> 09:52.740]  gentlemen that means that it is clotting living cells clotting quickly and
[09:52.740 --> 09:57.460]  you can put all sorts other chemicals in blood it doesn't do that this stuff is
[09:57.460 --> 10:03.340]  designed to do it now that's why when they give these in particularly long
[10:03.340 --> 10:06.700]  needles for a normal vaccine and they're putting it in deep and normally in the
[10:06.700 --> 10:10.060]  old days until about two years ago they would pull back to make sure they hadn't
[10:10.060 --> 10:14.620]  hit an artery or a vein or a larger capillary because if you injected any
[10:14.620 --> 10:18.460]  even regular vaccines into a vein or artery it could kill somebody to have a
[10:18.460 --> 10:21.820]  really bad reaction they don't do that now they just plunge it in and inject it
[10:21.820 --> 10:25.380]  that's on record that's how the UN orders you to do it and so if you're
[10:25.380 --> 10:30.380]  unlucky enough for it to go into a larger vessel one of the sub vessels of
[10:30.380 --> 10:34.820]  an artery or a vein and then it gets directly in it gets it hits your brain
[10:34.820 --> 10:38.780]  you're gonna have a big fat blood clot in minutes in your brain you're gonna be
[10:38.780 --> 10:43.500]  hitting the ground and the body's at the ground and the body's at the ground
[10:43.500 --> 10:47.620]  that's what's going on there that's what medical doctors and nurses have said
[10:47.620 --> 10:50.580]  they've learned to this because sometimes people collapse you know the blood
[10:50.580 --> 10:56.340]  just starts coming right out of the arm as well so this is incredible bio weapon
[10:56.340 --> 11:02.900]  and it's really biomechanical because it's a it's a nanoparticle so we're
[11:02.900 --> 11:06.820]  gonna be laying that out with him in the third hour today it's full 30 minute
[11:06.820 --> 11:11.780]  breakdown is at man dot video free world news dot TV the system obviously will
[11:11.780 --> 11:15.260]  come after us for putting this out but that's okay that's our job and I really
[11:15.260 --> 11:18.420]  want to ask you for yourself and your children's future and everybody's future
[11:18.420 --> 11:23.420]  that you get this information and share it because the globalist wouldn't be
[11:23.420 --> 11:28.700]  censoring us if that resistance was futile resistance is not futile so as
[11:28.700 --> 11:34.580]  I say the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was unwinnable
[11:34.580 --> 11:39.900]  now I don't want to just cover that the third hour I thought I'd give you a large
[11:39.900 --> 11:44.180]  stack of news this week from governments and others admitting stopping the
[11:44.180 --> 11:49.460]  shots Pfizer Moderna you name it first it was AstraZeneca and J&J but now
[11:49.460 --> 11:53.300]  they're stopping the Moderna the Pfizer around the world from massive increases
[11:53.300 --> 11:59.460]  in heart attacks blood clots and so much more and then we actually have the
[11:59.460 --> 12:04.180]  slide presentation of Dr. Fleming right here for you as well we're gonna be
[12:04.180 --> 12:08.060]  going over that before he joins us and then the really huge news about the
[12:08.060 --> 12:11.500]  official rollout of the vaccine passport here and how they plan to implement it
[12:11.500 --> 12:14.740]  forcibly on all of us in the near future incrementally we've got that he
[12:14.740 --> 12:20.900]  stacked and then this really important stack about Bolsonaro who is a big
[12:20.900 --> 12:23.660]  friend of the show and a great patriot and boy I wish Trump was as hardcore as
[12:23.660 --> 12:28.180]  him he gave an interview and warned that this is a manufactured virus with the
[12:28.180 --> 12:33.620]  HIV delivery system and that it turns off a large portion of your killer tees
[12:33.620 --> 12:37.780]  now that's Pfizer spokesperson's admitting that and scientists admitting
[12:37.780 --> 12:40.540]  that going back a year and they're just normalizing it like it's no big deal
[12:40.540 --> 12:44.580]  and that your immune system is lowered after you take the shots both Moderna
[12:44.580 --> 12:50.020]  or Pfizer and that basically it's devastating and in fact a lot of
[12:50.020 --> 12:56.060]  scientists have likened it to HIV but HIV kills T lymphocytes this just
[12:56.060 --> 13:03.060]  deactivates killer tees T lymphocytes are the super generals that program the
[13:03.060 --> 13:06.700]  captains and then the soldiers of the killer tees so this turns off killer
[13:06.700 --> 13:12.260]  tees HIV kills T lymphocytes that train the killer tees and he gave a well
[13:12.260 --> 13:15.940]  reason to interview but he's a president of a major country even was wrong you
[13:15.940 --> 13:21.260]  know that's for you to judge but he was dead on so Facebook Instagram and all of
[13:21.260 --> 13:25.860]  them including YouTube worked in unison to ban him and to take not just that
[13:25.860 --> 13:29.660]  video but other videos down of him speaking to punish him for doing a
[13:29.660 --> 13:36.780]  newspaper interview see that and I mean I think Bolsonaro's just arrest the
[13:36.780 --> 13:40.620]  executives of those companies in his country for espionage and for
[13:40.620 --> 13:44.540]  censorship of the head of state and this is just insane suppression of
[13:44.540 --> 13:47.860]  information but I've got a whole stack I'm gonna show you of them admitting
[13:47.860 --> 13:52.340]  everything Bolsonaro said mainstream news see his crime is just being a good
[13:52.340 --> 13:57.420]  man and telling the truth so we're gonna fact check that for you as well by the
[13:57.420 --> 14:01.620]  way I printed off articles backing Bolsonaro up in about a minute I just
[14:01.620 --> 14:07.780]  typed in HIV delivery system COVID-19 COVID-19 vaccine pulled because of false
[14:07.780 --> 14:12.860]  HIV positives COVID-19 vaccines linked to lower immunity and it just just
[14:12.860 --> 14:17.020]  thousands of articles I mean most of it from the enemy but they bury it to
[14:17.020 --> 14:22.020]  cover their ass they don't put it up in the front headline so it has HIV
[14:22.020 --> 14:26.420]  insertions that came out 20 months ago on info wars and it also came out on
[14:26.420 --> 14:30.900]  zero hedge there is in February and we had all the guests and experts on it's
[14:30.900 --> 14:37.540]  just all true it's all known so there's that stack and then it gets into the
[14:37.540 --> 14:41.780]  inflation and how the globalists are shutting the country down and how
[14:41.780 --> 14:46.820]  they're stoking race war and new huge developments on the listing parents that
[14:46.820 --> 14:51.860]  protest critical race theory or tranny time or drag Queen pedophile time at the
[14:51.860 --> 14:55.860]  schools the FBI is actually going to those houses now just pure red terror
[14:55.860 --> 14:59.740]  fear mongering just to see if we'll all just stand down and coward because I
[14:59.740 --> 15:03.100]  think we're a bunch of cowards no we've been asleep and we've been lazy
[15:03.100 --> 15:08.260]  globalists and so it's gonna backfire on the globalist we're gonna be looking at
[15:08.260 --> 15:13.620]  all that plus I know for a fact now that they've got people testifying to the
[15:13.620 --> 15:22.540]  January 6th Democrat witch hunt trial targeting me and really trying to
[15:22.540 --> 15:26.940]  develop some type of operation where then Congress demands I've been indicted
[15:26.940 --> 15:32.380]  they've already done that to Steve Bannon and so we've got a big stack of
[15:32.380 --> 15:38.180]  news on that front and just so much more here today but we are now in the thick
[15:38.180 --> 15:42.060]  of the battle against the globalist and all I can tell you is please support
[15:42.060 --> 15:45.860]  those local AM and FM stations those local TV stations and use the internet
[15:45.860 --> 15:51.140]  now while you still can to send out the link info wars dot com forward slash show
[15:51.140 --> 15:58.500]  band died video free world news dot TV because the truth lives at info wars if
[15:58.500 --> 16:02.860]  you're concerned about the power Alex Jones here on the morning of Friday
[16:02.860 --> 16:08.780]  October 22nd 2021 with a very important update for supporters of info wars

[17:10.580 --> 17:19.540]  defeat humanity then our God will reward us with eternal life that's
[17:19.540 --> 17:25.980]  basically the ethos of the globalists they must first play God they must first
[17:25.980 --> 17:32.580]  prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system and in a way
[17:32.580 --> 17:37.580]  they're right if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us destroy
[17:37.580 --> 17:41.020]  our children's futures the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open we
[17:41.020 --> 17:47.900]  really deserve what's happened to us so I asked you now are you going to step up
[17:47.900 --> 17:53.460]  and expose the new order even more I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble
[17:53.460 --> 18:01.100]  my efforts the front lines the fight is info wars.com I have the greatest sense
[18:01.100 --> 18:06.380]  of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul I've ever had in my 47 years on this
[18:06.380 --> 18:13.780]  planet I've had a lot of loss everybody else has and it's because it's a loss of
[18:13.780 --> 18:23.620]  ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for and
[18:23.620 --> 18:29.420]  now we're just throwing it all away and I see the general public in a medically
[18:29.420 --> 18:33.900]  induced scientifically induced behavioral psychologically controlled
[18:33.900 --> 18:39.420]  tranquy and I know we're being fed into this globalist be grounded it's so
[18:39.420 --> 18:46.740]  incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling
[18:46.740 --> 18:51.420]  apart and then degenerating collapsing and then coming back to life again it's
[18:51.420 --> 18:55.300]  just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control this process of
[18:55.300 --> 19:00.420]  decadence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[19:00.700 --> 19:06.300]  Your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet or

[19:10.420 --> 19:14.700]  unpopular they know you're angry and now to get around big tech it's more

[20:34.700 --> 20:44.540]  the info war. I am your host Alexander Emerick Jones of Texas the house of
[20:44.540 --> 20:53.340]  Texas. Alright ladies and gentlemen here we are let me go ahead and just start
[20:53.340 --> 21:02.380]  digging right into it for you. The world is waking up to Fauci and what a demon
[21:02.380 --> 21:07.140]  he is and I've talked about this on air but I almost feel like I haven't done a
[21:07.140 --> 21:12.020]  good job because I knew all this in fact we covered this on the air over the
[21:12.020 --> 21:20.340]  years when I probably interviewed let's not exaggerate 50 people early on 50
[21:20.340 --> 21:24.860]  scientists and others at least 50 probably no probably about 75 or something
[21:24.860 --> 21:29.260]  I think about it when I was first on air the first 10 years and then I have a
[21:29.260 --> 21:33.900]  tendency when I've covered something 50 60 70 a hundred times like the Federal
[21:33.900 --> 21:40.580]  Reserve being private or 9-11 being an inside job or giant government finders
[21:40.580 --> 21:44.980]  case CIA child kidnapping snuff film rings by the way that came out in the
[21:44.980 --> 21:50.140]  newspapers in the late 80s snuff films CIA DC a whole warehouse full of kids I
[21:50.140 --> 21:54.740]  mean they caught him doing it once I've covered something let's say a hundred
[21:54.740 --> 22:00.700]  times I tend to just go okay I'm done move on but this morning I had the great
[22:00.700 --> 22:06.380]  boom operator over there John say hey you need to cover Fauci it's coming out
[22:06.380 --> 22:12.980]  about how he tested experimental HIV drugs on orphans and as soon as he said
[22:12.980 --> 22:18.860]  that I remembered interviewing a bunch of medical doctors about it back in the
[22:18.860 --> 22:25.620]  late 90s early 2000s and it just hit me like a whole data dump oh yeah and I'm
[22:25.620 --> 22:29.540]  like oh I had the hemophiliac society on from Canada and I had the doctor on from
[22:29.540 --> 22:36.700]  from Little Rock and I had and so it all starts popping in my head about people
[22:36.700 --> 22:41.980]  being fire bombed that exposed it people being kidnapped people I had on
[22:41.980 --> 22:47.780]  ended up being murdered and found tortured to death see now you know why I
[22:47.780 --> 22:51.060]  tend to after I've already covered something I just go okay I'm done with
[22:51.060 --> 22:56.420]  that now and I wall it off purposely because I can't handle it you talk about
[22:56.420 --> 22:59.860]  Narls Barkley you know song about does that make me crazy because I didn't know
[22:59.860 --> 23:05.540]  enough I knew too much and so yeah this is good for the public though to be
[23:05.540 --> 23:10.780]  waking up to this that that you think Fauci just paid millions of dollars to
[23:10.780 --> 23:14.900]  have it dogs have their vocal cords removed and then had their heads put
[23:14.900 --> 23:20.860]  inside an enclosure with flesh-eating maggot laying bugs I mean do you think
[23:20.860 --> 23:26.260]  you just did that no no no they in America on black children hell this
[23:26.260 --> 23:33.460]  was a huge story in the 90s yeah there it is a bipartisan legislators demand
[23:33.460 --> 23:38.900]  answers from Fauci on cruel puppy experiments and then now I remember in
[23:38.900 --> 23:44.500]  the 90s and the 2000s it came out tens of thousands of black children because
[23:44.500 --> 23:48.060]  that's what Fauci wanted to test on like Joseph Mengele wanted to test on certain
[23:48.060 --> 23:52.780]  types of children and there were all those articles about the NIH and CDC
[23:52.780 --> 23:59.020]  testing experimental HIV drugs that they knew were killing people on children
[23:59.020 --> 24:07.180]  that had been born with HIV age drugs tested on foster children by Fauci CBS
[24:07.180 --> 24:14.580]  News and that's 2005 yeah that's about the last time see how good my memory is
[24:14.580 --> 24:21.100]  I said the late 1990s and the early 2000s you never saw it again ladies and
[24:21.100 --> 24:25.860]  gentlemen and this isn't about how much I know I'm telling you people think I
[24:25.860 --> 24:28.940]  like make stuff up because it sounds so horrible ladies and gentlemen I don't
[24:28.940 --> 24:32.980]  tell you 1% because I can't even deal with it in fact when I just opened my
[24:32.980 --> 24:35.500]  mind up and the crew we didn't script this and they're just typing them
[24:35.500 --> 24:40.740]  whatever I'm saying it's coming up whenever I start thinking about this I
[24:40.740 --> 24:46.460]  just remembered hundreds of projects Fauci ran specifically himself that where
[24:46.460 --> 24:51.420]  he didn't just test deadly HIV drugs on children they they tested a bunch of
[24:51.420 --> 24:55.260]  other illegal drugs and a bunch of experimental garbage and they got caught
[24:55.260 --> 25:01.820]  giving foster children diseases I mean you don't think they just stopped with
[25:01.820 --> 25:07.020]  injecting black people with syphilis now when you turn on the TV and you see
[25:07.020 --> 25:10.260]  every spokesperson for drug companies being a black man or woman or black
[25:10.260 --> 25:15.900]  child they tell you whites you're guilty and evil you've been mean to blacks now
[25:15.900 --> 25:20.540]  the blacks are spokespersons and then the very grip they're attacking and
[25:20.540 --> 25:25.500]  murdering and killing they use as a shield to cover up what they're doing I
[25:25.500 --> 25:28.980]  mean that's basic camouflage isn't it what did German soldiers do in World
[25:28.980 --> 25:33.740]  War two during D-Day with their Battle of the Bulls they tried to send in
[25:33.740 --> 25:37.580]  thousands of trained Germans that could speak good English some of which have
[25:37.580 --> 25:42.380]  been raised in the US to try to get through the US lines but pretty soon they
[25:42.380 --> 25:46.740]  would ask them hey who won the World Series last year or oh really what town
[25:46.740 --> 25:51.220]  are you from tell me and then boom they would catch them and it's the same thing
[25:51.220 --> 25:58.220]  here yep that's all this is ladies and gentlemen is the equivalent of Germans
[25:58.220 --> 26:05.300]  in World War two putting on US Army uniforms it's pure crap they can hire
[26:05.300 --> 26:10.100]  run DMC all day to say fight the racist whites do what you do their eugenics
[26:10.100 --> 26:14.420]  won't work cuz you take the shot yes he says that and they show a eugenics tree
[26:14.420 --> 26:18.540]  from my film in game that I exposed actually show documents that we went to
[26:18.540 --> 26:22.140]  the library and got that nobody else had put out in decades and that's the
[26:22.140 --> 26:26.820]  directly countering in game is run DMC so they can murder black people I mean
[26:26.820 --> 26:30.980]  you can't make that up but he got some good cash for that must feel good work
[26:30.980 --> 26:39.420]  for the devil so so that's how this is ladies and gentlemen Bill Gates is down
[26:39.420 --> 26:43.500]  the number one cause of polio worldwide source Reuters they tried to fact check
[26:43.500 --> 26:48.660]  Joe Rogan when I was on last October or not they had to retract the
[26:48.660 --> 26:52.980]  retraction because it was true that Reuters headline Bill Gates's sponsored
[26:52.980 --> 26:59.220]  vaccine number one cause of polio worldwide can we put an image up of the
[26:59.220 --> 27:02.100]  Tuskegee doctors injecting black people with cephalus and not letting them know
[27:02.100 --> 27:05.700]  they were gonna die over it in horrible pain over 40 years we got gates doing the
[27:05.700 --> 27:12.260]  same thing right next door with polio want to be paralyzed oh liberal oh but
[27:12.260 --> 27:17.940]  it's so liberal and then Noam Chomsky I mean if anything's close to Hitler in
[27:17.940 --> 27:24.900]  America it's Noam Chomsky little baby Hitler Noam Chomsky is now trying to I
[27:24.900 --> 27:30.060]  guess due to America what happened under Hitler to some of his ancestors in
[27:30.060 --> 27:36.240]  Ukraine Noam Chomsky says lock people up in ghettos lock people up in their
[27:36.240 --> 27:40.380]  homes and he says he doesn't worry about them getting food he says that okay I
[27:40.380 --> 27:44.700]  don't not worry do they get food just lock them up in their houses yes put us
[27:44.700 --> 27:49.900]  in a Warsaw ghetto like Poland put us in a ghetto like in Germany put us in a
[27:49.900 --> 27:54.900]  ghetto like Hungary Romania yes yes put those dirty Americans in there right
[27:54.900 --> 28:02.660]  now you creepy evil garden Noam garden Noam Kami Chomsky we're gonna be playing
[28:02.660 --> 28:09.500]  that clip coming up but it's just unbelievable but yes it's coming out
[28:09.500 --> 28:13.780]  that Fauci had dogs chained inside special cages so their heads to be
[28:13.780 --> 28:18.180]  eaten off by flesh-eating bugs while they beg for their lives and I told you
[28:18.180 --> 28:22.180]  the globalists call that sweet music they don't just do it to dogs they do
[28:22.180 --> 28:26.100]  it to the children the record is called maggotting where they chain you down and
[28:26.100 --> 28:31.060]  let screw screw flies go up your nose and lay eggs in your brain and then
[28:31.060 --> 28:34.940]  then they that's a that's a ritual they conduct by the way I'm on record years
[28:34.940 --> 28:38.620]  ago telling you that I'm record I'm record I know what the Satan's did hey
[28:38.620 --> 28:44.340]  sorry in fact they do stuff even far beyond maggotting but they love to hear
[28:44.340 --> 28:47.900]  you beg and they love to hear the pain of children starving to death begging for
[28:47.900 --> 28:52.060]  mommy okay we're gonna come back and tell you more about all this on the other

[29:57.220 --> 30:03.940]  support infowarsstore.com I want to explain something that is absolutely
[30:03.940 --> 30:07.060]  seed understanding our world it's very very simple but the most people don't
[30:07.060 --> 30:13.180]  know the privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating
[30:13.180 --> 30:18.540]  thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them to
[30:18.540 --> 30:25.060]  buy up infrastructure intellectual property energy they're using it to buy
[30:25.060 --> 30:30.140]  people to buy influence and in the past they created thousands of trillions so
[30:30.140 --> 30:33.660]  that they could leverage that manipulate markets but they never allowed that
[30:33.660 --> 30:37.380]  money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive
[30:37.380 --> 30:41.740]  inflation now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every
[30:41.740 --> 30:45.860]  sector of the world economy buying up everything not to have the companies
[30:45.860 --> 30:49.940]  operate but to actually shut them down and force the collapse of
[30:49.940 --> 30:54.260]  civilization making the companies they do find the only things left standing
[30:54.260 --> 30:58.100]  this is the great reset this is what's happening now warn everyone is the only
[30:58.100 --> 31:03.420]  way to stop it it was almost 15 years ago that I released my seminal film in
[31:03.420 --> 31:07.940]  game blueprint for global enslavement then that documentary I predicted the
[31:07.940 --> 31:12.940]  globalist would establish world government by releasing a virus demanding
[31:12.940 --> 31:16.500]  that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a collapse of our
[31:16.500 --> 31:20.900]  industrial society and now they've done it how did I know they would do it
[31:20.900 --> 31:25.460]  because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and
[31:25.460 --> 31:29.540]  internal meetings were leaked you see then I was tracking the Bilderberg group
[31:29.540 --> 31:33.540]  whose head at the time was Klaus Schwab and our sources inside were
[31:33.540 --> 31:37.820]  confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch this great reset well
[31:37.820 --> 31:41.260]  we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the third world and the
[31:41.260 --> 31:45.620]  first world on its ass is a tyrannical corporate world government the total
[31:45.620 --> 31:50.980]  censorship no due process destruction of the family and then incrementally more
[31:50.980 --> 31:55.500]  and more deadly injections of poison mass-creating as vaccines to poison
[31:55.500 --> 31:58.980]  us in the populace this is what info wars is fighting we're fighting for the
[31:58.980 --> 32:12.380]  future
[32:12.380 --> 32:22.380]  safe but the injection is not ready and so I need all of you to stay indoors for
[32:22.380 --> 32:31.500]  the next 15 days I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop
[32:31.500 --> 32:39.060]  at mega corporations that way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the
[32:39.060 --> 32:46.420]  world economy leaving companies that only I own profitable you will then be my
[32:46.420 --> 33:06.860]  slaves you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:16.420 --> 33:22.340]  ladies and gentlemen you are receiving this transmission you are the
[33:22.340 --> 33:30.820]  resistance live from Austin, Texas you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[33:31.340 --> 33:36.580]  ladies and gentlemen Fauci is getting exposed right now I'm about to really
[33:36.580 --> 33:42.860]  get into it and then all of this other really earth-shaking news but I was
[33:42.860 --> 33:47.500]  talking last segment about how it's coming out that Fauci did secret medical
[33:47.500 --> 33:51.380]  experiments is on on black children and other poor children with mainly black
[33:51.380 --> 33:58.700]  children over 90% and they would even go and pay mothers to sign over one of
[33:58.700 --> 34:02.740]  their six seven eight nine ten year olds this is in the news at the time when it
[34:02.740 --> 34:07.300]  came out and the mother wouldn't want to do it they'd say listen we're gonna take
[34:07.300 --> 34:11.620]  that two-year-old and do medical experiments is on them if you don't let
[34:11.620 --> 34:18.540]  us have the nine-year-old so that's who Fauci is and so when you see the
[34:18.540 --> 34:23.020]  Democrats out there worshiping him and oh my god we've got to do whatever he
[34:23.020 --> 34:29.580]  says and so what if they chained up dogs with their head inside a hole to
[34:29.580 --> 34:35.820]  another enclosure full of sand flies burrowing in and eating them alive and
[34:35.820 --> 34:40.180]  then laying eggs inside their flesh I mean so what that's a kind of a nice
[34:40.180 --> 34:44.740]  liberal thing to do he's Fauci you're not allowed to question Fauci oh you
[34:44.740 --> 34:49.660]  question Fauci on ivermectin your band oh you question Fauci on gain a function
[34:49.660 --> 34:54.540]  your band oh you question Fauci on natural immunity but being better than
[34:54.540 --> 34:59.540]  the vaccine oh Rand Paul your speech is banned do it again you'll be taking off
[34:59.540 --> 35:06.540]  YouTube permanently but Donald Trump didn't have a dog at the White House so
[35:06.540 --> 35:10.540]  he's bad because he didn't have a dog now I'll say that is kind of a strike
[35:10.540 --> 35:17.100]  against him but I get it he grew up in Manhattan not a good place for a dog but
[35:17.100 --> 35:21.100]  I'm sarcastic about that Fauci's torturing dogs to death and I said the
[35:21.100 --> 35:25.700]  shesh that said but nobody cares about the children the thousands of which they
[35:25.700 --> 35:30.180]  did studies on in the last year with the Pfizer Moderna shots and a bunch of
[35:30.180 --> 35:34.540]  deaths and illnesses and heart attacks that is in the news today because they're
[35:34.540 --> 35:38.780]  going public and a bunch of lawsuits are getting filed as we speak in places
[35:38.780 --> 35:42.460]  like Texas don't know about that by next week that's when the big one gets
[35:42.460 --> 35:48.820]  filed I'm told so this is just a massive massive time to be alive and people can
[35:48.820 --> 35:54.220]  get upset about dogs so maybe the world will be saved by puppies because we don't
[35:54.220 --> 35:57.500]  care about black kids or white kids we don't care about children being tested
[35:57.500 --> 36:02.180]  on with their parents signing them on for experiments maybe we care about
[36:02.180 --> 36:08.380]  puppies but I remember reading about the VA in the last 20 plus years where they
[36:08.380 --> 36:13.500]  would not take care of veterans to a point and things were so dirty that they
[36:13.500 --> 36:17.780]  would even restrain veterans and especially old ones and that screw flies
[36:17.780 --> 36:23.020]  would go up their nose and lay eggs in their sinus and within eat their brain
[36:23.020 --> 36:29.180]  and then we learned about cases where that's one thing that psychopaths and
[36:29.180 --> 36:32.060]  occultists have been known to do and you hear that you know that can't be real
[36:32.060 --> 36:36.020]  it is real and I was just mentioning that last segment you can try to search it
[36:36.020 --> 36:39.420]  and find it but it's last time I saw that was probably 15 years ago in the
[36:39.420 --> 36:45.340]  news but good old John Harmon our great crew member who's been here 18 years
[36:45.340 --> 36:50.380]  been a producer affiliate relations director he remembers that so I caught
[36:50.380 --> 36:54.860]  him in the break room getting a donut he was getting a donut and I was lusting
[36:54.860 --> 36:59.700]  over the donuts but didn't eat one is already ate one earlier and I said you
[36:59.700 --> 37:02.500]  remember me talking about the maggots and all that he goes yeah I'm
[37:02.500 --> 37:07.140]  nagging so again I'm not making this up he goes yeah I remember Rothkopf too you
[37:07.140 --> 37:10.660]  talked about a few weeks ago Rothkopf so I said why don't you repeat that and
[37:10.660 --> 37:14.580]  then he goes yeah I'll talk about Thomas Barnett too so I drug him in here real
[37:14.580 --> 37:18.060]  quick tell people that I'm not bs-ing you're not bs-ing you talked about
[37:18.060 --> 37:22.700]  maggoting and all this stuff for how many years I mean longtime listeners can
[37:22.700 --> 37:27.740]  attest to that too I mean all this stuff that you laid out that's why Thomas
[37:27.740 --> 37:32.020]  Barnett or not Barnett Rothkopf when you got him on as a guest during the break
[37:32.020 --> 37:37.020]  he legit recruited Alex Jones and we're both kind of like whoa did that just
[37:37.020 --> 37:41.860]  happen just because he was explaining how you assess things and how you can
[37:41.860 --> 37:46.020]  kind of see through the fog of things most people can't do that most people
[37:46.020 --> 37:50.460]  don't get it and that's why when you talk about like tomorrow's news
[37:50.460 --> 37:55.460]  today and how you kind of Alex Jones connects the dots that most people don't
[37:55.460 --> 38:00.500]  really grasp or understand you kind of cut through that fog it's I mean that's
[38:00.500 --> 38:04.620]  why Rothkopf was like hey you should just join up with us he's like come to
[38:04.620 --> 38:09.660]  New York next week we'll sign you on yeah absolutely and I just remember that
[38:09.660 --> 38:12.260]  moment I was like whoa did that just happen we should have been recording
[38:12.260 --> 38:16.220]  this during the break but and he went on he said you know there's only 6,000
[38:16.220 --> 38:19.980]  superclass you can be the leader of the American Populous Group which was a smart
[38:19.980 --> 38:22.940]  thing for him to be trying to recruit me my point is he's the only one that ever
[38:22.940 --> 38:26.260]  did it in front of somebody and didn't say it was off record yeah I mean this is
[38:26.260 --> 38:28.980]  the guy that hangs out with Kissinger and all these guys the head of the
[38:28.980 --> 38:34.300]  Kissinger group he's like Kissinger's minion so is so is Klaus Schwab so yeah
[38:34.300 --> 38:37.460]  I mean that's kind of a big deal so when you mentioned that I'm always like yeah
[38:37.460 --> 38:41.180]  I actually remember that that's actually true and a lot of people I mean they they
[38:41.180 --> 38:45.620]  hear what inforce puts out there and Alex Jones puts out and they it's hard to
[38:45.620 --> 38:50.940]  believe but I mean I've I mean it's just kind of mind-blowing how and then you
[38:50.940 --> 38:54.900]  remember the Thomas Barnett thing I'm sorry it was mind-blowing yeah Thomas
[38:54.900 --> 39:00.460]  Barnett I mean all those interviews I mean I remember after the show these
[39:00.460 --> 39:06.180]  guys would call me up on my extension in my office and just say hey you know I'm
[39:06.180 --> 39:10.580]  a listener at Alex Jones I'm he would mention his name and I would like
[39:10.580 --> 39:14.540]  Google and after the phone call go whoa this guy this guy's like a fortune 500
[39:14.540 --> 39:19.460]  you know major CEO of a company he would say that you know out in Hollywood
[39:19.460 --> 39:23.660]  everyone's just talking about Alex Jones at dinner parties and stuff did you
[39:23.660 --> 39:27.100]  remember did you remember when we got called by the head of harp oh yeah I
[39:27.100 --> 39:31.620]  remember that they invited us up there to up to check out the facility and they
[39:31.620 --> 39:34.940]  put an art they put an Air Force Colonel on the line though when the guy
[39:34.940 --> 39:37.140]  talked about how they could ignite the atmosphere they said that's it this
[39:37.140 --> 39:41.540]  interview is over they interrupted they jumped in that was crazy yeah you know
[39:41.540 --> 39:45.660]  that was probably 16 years ago we've got to find that archive it's somewhere
[39:45.660 --> 39:50.940]  maybe the old network has it or maybe good or West has it somewhere stashed
[39:50.940 --> 39:56.380]  but yeah these things really happen it's it's kind of what I'll put a thousand
[39:56.380 --> 40:01.140]  dollar bounty on anybody finds that head of harp interviewed on info wars because
[40:01.140 --> 40:05.220]  they contacted you and then we checked it out and indeed like oh Alex we're not
[40:05.220 --> 40:09.540]  bad just back then folks they were trying to get me recruited before we got big
[40:09.540 --> 40:15.420]  these guys are smart that was crazy yeah I mean I can understand why people
[40:15.420 --> 40:20.140]  think this stuff is like you know Alex Jones just watched too many ex files but
[40:20.140 --> 40:24.300]  I mean once you get into this it usually takes like one little topic that you
[40:24.300 --> 40:28.900]  kind of see past the BS and it kind of you know awakes you or unlocks your
[40:28.900 --> 40:32.460]  mind and then that's why people watching for us because they're just like wow I
[40:32.460 --> 40:35.660]  get it's like me saying yeah you know Chris Carter's a big listener and we
[40:35.660 --> 40:39.860]  talk some and and then years later he gives an interview I love Alex Jones
[40:39.860 --> 40:43.580]  he's not a racist he's a good guy my new ex files is based on Alex Jones we were
[40:43.580 --> 40:47.580]  like whoa you weren't lying yeah folks we've been big for a long time and it's
[40:47.580 --> 40:51.420]  not about bragging about how big we are it's the fact that you changed the world
[40:51.420 --> 40:55.660]  by supporting us we all did this together every man woman and child that
[40:55.660 --> 40:59.820]  listens to the show and supports it you especially people that did it 25 28 years
[40:59.820 --> 41:03.980]  ago folks you changed the world and you just don't know how important you are
[41:03.980 --> 41:07.540]  yeah even Dean Haglin the one of the characters on the lone government from
[41:07.540 --> 41:12.100]  the ex files he showed up at your doorstep I was like whoa Alex the CIA
[41:12.100 --> 41:16.980]  actually puts story they give us stories to put in our episode so people think
[41:16.980 --> 41:21.420]  it's just like science fiction stuff so they kind of poo poo it but I mean
[41:21.420 --> 41:25.540]  remember that that was crazy and now they're putting shots of Ben Livingston
[41:25.540 --> 41:29.260]  the father of weather weapons that was in World War two with the weather weapons
[41:29.260 --> 41:33.260]  I don't even it's like 92 years old at this time still running a major weather
[41:33.260 --> 41:37.540]  control company this incredible yeah weather month and that was because they
[41:37.540 --> 41:41.980]  just declassified thousands of pages from the 60s when he was leading squadrons
[41:41.980 --> 41:45.540]  into Vietnam to flood the Ho Chi Minh trail so I called him and got him flown
[41:45.540 --> 41:49.740]  from Lubbock to Austin the next day but then he got called by national security
[41:49.740 --> 41:52.460]  groups and wouldn't come back on after that so again that's how we used to
[41:52.460 --> 41:55.180]  operate like look this just got declassified the leader of was Ben
[41:55.180 --> 41:58.660]  Livingston says he lives in Lubbock call Lubbock and then boom he's on the show
[41:58.660 --> 42:03.660]  yeah that was so awesome being just a board opposite the audio guy 18 19 years
[42:03.660 --> 42:08.980]  ago just hearing all these conversations calling up all these guys you
[42:08.980 --> 42:13.020]  know as guests or whatever and hearing the conversations behind the scenes and
[42:13.020 --> 42:18.060]  a lot of the stuff off here that was crazy like the DC madam that supposed
[42:18.060 --> 42:21.220]  we hung herself she was always you know you're like not gonna kill yourself she's
[42:21.220 --> 42:25.460]  like no I'm not gonna kill myself and exposing all these things and then she
[42:25.460 --> 42:28.860]  kills herself she hangs herself like a month and then remember Thomas Barnett
[42:28.860 --> 42:32.500]  one of the top war college guys was like he's like you'll never you'll never
[42:32.500 --> 42:35.900]  defeat us the new order you'll never defeat America he goes we will remember
[42:35.900 --> 42:39.700]  that yep yep and they bailed on the interview oh yeah yeah that was like
[42:39.700 --> 42:43.580]  during the break you'll never stop our new world order literally like that
[42:43.580 --> 42:46.540]  all right John I just thought we'd tell a little bit of those stories it's just
[42:46.540 --> 42:49.740]  behind the scene stuff we're gonna come back with Noam Chomsky you want to be
[42:49.740 --> 42:54.020]  locked in your home and have no food he's loving liberal so it's okay we're
[42:54.020 --> 42:59.500]  talking about this monster showing his real stripes we come back I'm sitting
[42:59.500 --> 43:05.700]  here I am taping this update on the morning of Friday October 22nd 2021
[43:05.700 --> 43:09.860]  listeners who've already tried and really seen the powerful effects of
[43:09.860 --> 43:15.180]  Rainforest Ultra should be excited to know that we've got a limited supply of
[43:15.180 --> 43:19.420]  it in stock but it'll be sold out at current sales rates by Monday morning
[43:19.420 --> 43:24.620]  despite that fact we're still offering a major discount of 25% off it is an
[43:24.620 --> 43:28.580]  amazing new tropic I went to one of the top labs the country and I said I want
[43:28.580 --> 43:33.980]  very powerful quick acting extremely clean new tropic that wears off quick
[43:33.980 --> 43:37.140]  because I want to be able to take it if I've got to work till 10 at night take it
[43:37.140 --> 43:42.020]  at 7 and for it to wear off by 10 and that's exactly what they did with

[43:46.100 --> 43:49.540]  10 hours it's a different formula it's over the top powerful so strong I can't

[43:57.500 --> 44:03.140]  infoorstore.com the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is
[44:03.140 --> 44:08.140]  plenty to be afraid of today half the population has lined up for an untested
[44:08.140 --> 44:12.220]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be
[44:12.220 --> 44:16.580]  afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this
[44:16.580 --> 44:21.260]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an
[44:21.260 --> 44:26.300]  artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who
[44:26.300 --> 44:29.820]  have awoken from the spell we know this is all really happening and it's
[44:29.820 --> 44:35.220]  unbelievably unsettling to see but there is only two things to do we continue
[44:35.220 --> 44:38.860]  sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people awaken
[44:38.860 --> 44:43.940]  from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the
[44:43.940 --> 44:48.780]  days of convenience are soon coming to an end and so we must prepare get up to a

[46:17.140 --> 46:21.620]  fear that so much so that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that

[46:28.460 --> 46:34.180]  be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and
[46:34.180 --> 46:39.260]  all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they
[46:39.260 --> 46:43.500]  know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this
[46:43.500 --> 46:47.500]  world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep in

[46:51.700 --> 46:56.260]  the globalist are manifesting and setting up is safe and we are opposing the

[47:00.860 --> 47:24.300]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:24.300 --> 47:29.980]  welcome back the Alex Jones show here on this Tuesday October 26 transmission we
[47:29.980 --> 47:33.340]  have just done a lot we've gone through a lot together and we couldn't have done
[47:33.340 --> 47:36.820]  any of it without you the listeners and viewers who are not spectators the fact
[47:36.820 --> 47:39.700]  that you spread the word that you pray for us and that you buy products at
[47:39.700 --> 47:43.860]  infowarstore.com has changed the world and now the globalists who've known how
[47:43.860 --> 47:48.100]  effective info wars is for over a decade we were kind of under the radar
[47:48.100 --> 47:54.460]  before that are just in a complete and absolute firestorm in an attempt to get
[47:54.460 --> 47:59.420]  us off the air so please pray for us and please continue spread the word I did a
[47:59.420 --> 48:05.340]  lot of preparation for today's show and I've absolutely got to cover the
[48:05.340 --> 48:10.860]  attempted race war news the over-the-top important COVID-19 development news the
[48:10.860 --> 48:17.140]  latest Bill Gates implantable microchip news there's just so massive all of the
[48:17.140 --> 48:22.620]  information coming out about Fauci who they've raised to the level of a deity in
[48:22.620 --> 48:27.380]  the corporate media and just how horrible and evil this true Joseph Mengele is I
[48:27.380 --> 48:31.700]  mean if telling black mothers we're gonna take your nine-year-old for medical
[48:31.700 --> 48:35.620]  experiments and shine the papers or we'll take your two-year-old I mean that
[48:35.620 --> 48:40.740]  came out in court that was confirmed they had to settle then what else will
[48:40.740 --> 48:46.020]  they do I mean who is like that who acts like that well Joseph Mengele did
[48:46.020 --> 48:50.460]  stuff like that the angel of death so there is a certain percentage of research
[48:50.460 --> 48:55.660]  scientists that are psychopaths and we know that historically I mean how many
[48:55.660 --> 49:00.780]  Marvel comic plots are on that how many fiction movies have a mad scientist you
[49:00.780 --> 49:04.020]  know doing stuff at the secret lab that's because that stuff really happens
[49:04.020 --> 49:09.060]  that stuff really goes on how many doctors and nurses do they catch killing
[49:09.060 --> 49:14.820]  babies or killing patients I had Dr. Bartlett on a few months ago and he
[49:14.820 --> 49:17.540]  said yeah the best people I've met have been doctors and the worst people have
[49:17.540 --> 49:22.620]  been doctors a certain percent are psychopaths that went and got that job
[49:22.620 --> 49:25.740]  because they wanted to be able to kill people and hurt people and get away with
[49:25.740 --> 49:30.740]  it just like 95% of people in the military are in there because of their
[49:30.740 --> 49:37.100]  family or a job or they want to serve but about 5% are because they want to
[49:37.100 --> 49:42.740]  kill people and and they get off directly on it so that's that's what's
[49:42.740 --> 49:48.100]  going on here ladies and gentlemen and that's who's attacking us and that's
[49:48.100 --> 49:53.000]  just carrying this out so the guy running the whole global UN Wuhan lab covered
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.980]  19 operation the guy that cooked it up the guy that lied to Congress the guy
[49:55.980 --> 50:00.420]  that runs the big media that runs big tech that's censoring us is the guy
[50:00.420 --> 50:05.140]  chaining dogs up so flesh-eating bugs can eat them and injecting kidnapped
[50:05.140 --> 50:11.940]  black kids with deadly drugs I mean he makes Ed Buck look like a saint so this
[50:11.940 --> 50:16.700]  isn't silence of the lambs where you'll cook your liver and habit with a fine
[50:16.700 --> 50:22.940]  Q&A this isn't fictional Baron Harkin and tearing people's hearts out or blowing
[50:22.940 --> 50:29.500]  up desert planets this is the real world this isn't true crime with Woody
[50:29.500 --> 50:35.180]  Harrelson and you know other actors like Matthew McConaughey finding devil
[50:35.180 --> 50:42.580]  worshippers in Louisiana this is the real world and of course it wasn't just
[50:42.580 --> 50:47.420]  monkeys like I said it wasn't just beagles it was all sorts of other animals
[50:47.420 --> 50:51.620]  that they were testing all manner of torture on because it's their religion
[50:51.620 --> 50:58.180]  they're not doing it for a reason they like it I told the story of my dad at
[50:58.180 --> 51:03.380]  15 years old one summer being sent to MD Anderson Cancer Research Institute
[51:03.380 --> 51:08.700]  because he signed up he thought with NASA the federal government and you know
[51:08.700 --> 51:11.940]  oh you're in UT and oh you're gonna go to this laboratory and you're gonna do
[51:11.940 --> 51:16.740]  this this isn't NASA and of course he was being prepped to be like a Fauci
[51:16.740 --> 51:23.340]  type as he had the best test course in the state of Texas at that time and it
[51:23.340 --> 51:27.300]  was the same thing my dad my dad told me well most doctors are nice but some are
[51:27.300 --> 51:32.380]  really crazy and I said well what he said well this is what went on at MD
[51:32.380 --> 51:37.060]  Anderson this is what I saw on the cancer ward I saw medical doctor
[51:37.060 --> 51:41.980]  scientist research scientist injecting people with lethal stuff and like sexually
[51:41.980 --> 51:45.980]  getting excited about it remember my dad I was a kid describing the other than
[51:45.980 --> 51:49.540]  them injecting rats mice and then later humans he saw with stuff that people
[51:49.540 --> 51:53.140]  signed on to by the way to basically for medical science knowing they're about
[51:53.140 --> 51:56.700]  to die in a month or whatever to do it that's the type of stuff goes on in
[51:56.700 --> 52:01.860]  secret research things but my point is that's what we're dealing with that's
[52:01.860 --> 52:08.300]  who we're under the control of and then it makes a lot more sense doesn't and so
[52:08.300 --> 52:11.380]  to have a debate with everybody about whether this exists or not is
[52:11.380 --> 52:16.460]  ridiculous it's all out in the open and I've had them try to hire me at least
[52:16.460 --> 52:21.220]  six or seven times off record and once on record and so I know how real the New
[52:21.220 --> 52:26.500]  World Order ish okay because most other men just sell out because they want to
[52:26.500 --> 52:29.540]  fly around in private jets and helicopters and you know be part of the
[52:29.540 --> 52:32.580]  establishment and most people don't even get an offer to be in the
[52:32.580 --> 52:36.620]  establishment but to me it's not like oh aren't I cool it's like being offered to
[52:36.620 --> 52:40.820]  you know jump down a black hole into hell but it's just time to wake up and to
[52:40.820 --> 52:48.580]  realize that and to face it yep there it is what I saw and what they did to the
[52:48.580 --> 52:52.180]  children yep they are killing kids just get it off the screen I can't even look
[52:52.180 --> 53:00.380]  at this crap and who haunch showed it who ran the show who sees you with his a
[53:00.380 --> 53:05.780]  little value as a lab rat or as a guinea pig Anthony our Lord and Savior
[53:05.780 --> 53:11.340]  Fauci so I'm gonna hit that but first I want to get into Noam Chomsky and then
[53:11.340 --> 53:18.580]  we've got Dr. Fleming who's an MD PhD and a lawyer very very respected he went
[53:18.580 --> 53:24.180]  hired some top scientists laboratory scientist to do the test on live blood
[53:24.180 --> 53:29.740]  whole human blood in vitro and the findings are exactly what you thought
[53:29.740 --> 53:33.860]  it would be but even more shocking yeah wonder why it's causing blood clots why
[53:33.860 --> 53:38.140]  it's causing I mean a cobra can't bite you and make your blood clot as good as
[53:38.140 --> 53:42.060]  this I mean this is some deadly stuff for the tiny amount you get put in your
[53:42.060 --> 53:48.220]  body it causes a chain reaction of blood clotting in the body and if it gets
[53:48.220 --> 53:52.700]  into a capillary or a vein and or an artery it's picked up by capillary put
[53:52.700 --> 53:57.940]  back into a larger artery or vein and it hits your brain you are going to be
[53:57.940 --> 54:03.540]  convulsing and probably dying that day but they're not meant to kill you right
[54:03.540 --> 54:06.700]  away it's just sometimes they hit a vein or something so but to kill you in a
[54:06.700 --> 54:13.220]  couple years slowly but they'll suck the money out first so that's coming up but
[54:13.220 --> 54:16.940]  yeah we're breaking this year because he's already tweeted about it started to
[54:16.940 --> 54:19.540]  talk about it but Joe told me he was getting ready to go after you know
[54:19.540 --> 54:23.820]  Fauci on the dog stuff days ago so now there's an article out on an info wars
[54:23.820 --> 54:28.100]  Rogan set to take on Fauci over puppy torches for sparking new class with
[54:28.100 --> 54:32.620]  mainstream media you heard it here first so that's coming up next segment I'm
[54:32.620 --> 54:39.580]  gonna back up some of the background on that for you as well but watch them come
[54:39.580 --> 54:45.740]  in and defend Fauci and torturing dogs to death and then of course Joe can then
[54:45.740 --> 54:52.340]  hit him with oh what about inner city kids with deadly experimental unauthorized
[54:52.340 --> 54:57.220]  by the FDA HIV drugs that killed them that turned off their immune system and
[54:57.220 --> 55:01.100]  shriveled them up and made them die basically like chemotherapy well that's
[55:01.100 --> 55:06.380]  how you love the black people as you kill them so see how the left and all the
[55:06.380 --> 55:10.180]  Twitter supporters and Instagram supporters see who you are you're very
[55:10.180 --> 55:13.740]  proud of yourselves now because you're on the winning team you think just like
[55:13.740 --> 55:19.140]  the Nazis thought that all right two big announcements here I have not launched
[55:19.140 --> 55:22.620]  the new specials today because I've been too busy with all this breaking news
[55:22.620 --> 55:25.940]  until 10 o'clock last night to come up with new specials plus so much of our
[55:25.940 --> 55:28.740]  best selling products are sold out so they're really I don't know what to have

[56:01.780 --> 56:06.060]  super fast-acting super smooth and also dissipates very very quickly at least

[1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:47.940]  demon eyes and lied about broadcast the Alex Jones show okay let's talk about
[1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:55.140]  Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky is a celebrated FOP he is a fake he is a
[1:00:55.140 --> 1:01:04.700]  fraud he is a scammer he is a empty hollow bag he is a nobody he has been
[1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:09.060]  funded by the establishment and by the big tax-free foundations his entire
[1:01:09.060 --> 1:01:17.100]  academic life he is a man that has made gargantuan amounts of money but just
[1:01:17.100 --> 1:01:22.380]  like Bernie Sanders and others he doesn't want you to have any money he
[1:01:22.380 --> 1:01:27.420]  claims he's fighting the establishment but he's almost always aligned with the
[1:01:27.420 --> 1:01:34.780]  establishment and so now he's come out and said in a bunch of different
[1:01:34.780 --> 1:01:39.660]  interviews I've seen at least three of them myself yesterday and said lock
[1:01:39.660 --> 1:01:46.220]  people up in their homes and he doesn't care how they get food now was it wrong
[1:01:46.220 --> 1:01:54.340]  to lock Jews up in their homes in the Warsaw ghetto in Poland or where his
[1:01:54.340 --> 1:02:02.060]  ancestors were in Ukraine and the answer is no so why do Americans deserve that
[1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:10.460]  at your hands why are you doing or trying to do to us what Hitler did to the
[1:02:10.460 --> 1:02:13.740]  Jews because Hitler said the Jews have got to be locked up they're dirty and
[1:02:13.740 --> 1:02:20.660]  they're diseased that's actually what Hitler said it was all about hygiene
[1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:24.300]  that that's how the Nazis got started one of their main planks and the first
[1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:28.380]  people they were killing were mentally retarded children and others something
[1:02:28.380 --> 1:02:31.620]  the left says they want to get rid of today hell I got national TV in the
[1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:36.380]  Netherlands on their PBS their public television you know literally telling a
[1:02:36.380 --> 1:02:42.300]  down syndrome man that you cause society three times more you should just die so
[1:02:42.300 --> 1:02:47.900]  so the left want to ration care they want control because the brain bugs the
[1:02:47.900 --> 1:02:58.700]  priest class up at the top of it like gnomes communist Chomsky want to play
[1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:04.460]  God that's it so he's a disgusting creature he should go live in North
[1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:10.620]  Korea and he's come out and said that oh because you're endangering people because
[1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:13.740]  you're gonna make them sick oh funny let's just say this was a perfect
[1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:17.420]  vaccine it was a vaccine it actually worked this is even a vaccine it's an
[1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:21.300]  mRNA technology it's got all these serious problems it skipped all the
[1:03:21.300 --> 1:03:26.180]  actual testing the biggest most corrupt corporations with the worst history are
[1:03:26.180 --> 1:03:32.980]  behind it Fauci is has a history of testing deadly experimental HIV drugs
[1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:37.700]  on foster children that they forcibly took from their mothers under threat of
[1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:41.660]  taking their other children to do medical experiments on them I mean this is
[1:03:41.660 --> 1:03:47.060]  Joseph Mingle all over again and there's no Chomsky cheerleading for Fauci like
[1:03:47.060 --> 1:03:53.820]  he's a God and no Chomsky is an academic he knows all this he understands all
[1:03:53.820 --> 1:03:58.820]  this and he shows who he really is an America hating parasite that came here
[1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:05.980]  to conquer us and enslave us and destroy us he is cancer at 90 plus years of age
[1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:10.700]  and he's taken the mask off and is showing the world who he is no Chomsky
[1:04:10.700 --> 1:04:15.100]  lock vaccine skeptics in their homes and deprive them of food full videos on
[1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:19.420]  info wars.com and that dub tells what John Oliver attacks cops for vaccine
[1:04:19.420 --> 1:04:25.100]  mandates says fire them let them quit reimposing COVID restrictions in the UK
[1:04:25.100 --> 1:04:33.460]  they're moving forward and it goes on and on and on and on and on we're gonna
[1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:41.900]  come back and we're gonna hit all of this on the other side I'm just I'm just

[1:06:45.660 --> 1:06:50.500]  Bandod video and his trademark copyright free get it share it cut it up do
[1:06:50.500 --> 1:06:55.620]  whatever you do with it put your bugs on it we don't care just get it out to
[1:06:55.620 --> 1:07:02.780]  everybody he'll be joining us coming up in this third hour respect and research
[1:07:02.780 --> 1:07:07.740]  scientists who tested Pfizer's covered Vax has made multiple nightmare
[1:07:07.740 --> 1:07:12.300]  discoveries that is coming up in the next hour and I'll hit some of it this hour
[1:07:12.300 --> 1:07:22.820]  as well but what's the big picture here we have what is the big picture here we
[1:07:22.820 --> 1:07:30.140]  have all the major fortune 500 companies we have almost every major world leader
[1:07:30.140 --> 1:07:34.540]  we have big tech unified the big banks unified Hollywood unified the whole
[1:07:34.540 --> 1:07:41.820]  global entertainment system unified saying Western populations in New Zealand
[1:07:41.820 --> 1:07:51.380]  Australia Canada the UK Europe and the United States must take the unapproved
[1:07:51.380 --> 1:07:56.820]  experimental injections that are not even approved until the year 2026 but
[1:07:56.820 --> 1:08:01.860]  they did approve it the year 2026 they play a game saying it's approved it's
[1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:06.380]  like saying you know zoners have approved the Mars base and so there is a
[1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:10.580]  Mars base well no nobody's on Mars they haven't built the base yet but you can
[1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:15.660]  say that they've approved the building of the base so that's how they're
[1:08:15.660 --> 1:08:19.660]  engaging in this manipulation and so now we have the numbers coming out of
[1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:24.140]  massive heart attacks and my car died as heart swelling and and blood clots and
[1:08:24.140 --> 1:08:32.620]  all of this death and we've got Hillary Clinton and we've got all these other
[1:08:32.620 --> 1:08:38.820]  people on TV saying we must have the vaccine mandates of LA and New York and
[1:08:38.820 --> 1:08:46.100]  Seattle and of areas of Europe and areas of Australia must come to every
[1:08:46.100 --> 1:08:50.060]  town and every city across the world we must have vaccine passports tied to
[1:08:50.060 --> 1:08:54.700]  carbon passports tied to a social credit score they even say that now it's out in
[1:08:54.700 --> 1:08:59.780]  the open they both group the UN all announced it two weeks ago and so now
[1:08:59.780 --> 1:09:05.260]  they've gone from beta to operational and then outcomes John Oliver and Stephen
[1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:09.740]  Colbert and every one of these so-called comics who get away with lying to people
[1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:15.460]  by claiming it's all just comedy fake news a fake news man engaged in fake
[1:09:15.460 --> 1:09:19.580]  news calling for who needs to be censored and who needs to be bullied and
[1:09:19.580 --> 1:09:27.020]  who needs to be silenced and then crawling out of his hold is academic
[1:09:27.020 --> 1:09:32.340]  Noam Chomsky funded his whole life by universities funded by big corporations
[1:09:32.340 --> 1:09:38.860]  now in complete alignment with Pfizer and Moderna and AstraZeneca and all the
[1:09:38.860 --> 1:09:43.180]  most powerful corporations on earth that want to go into our bodily autonomy and
[1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:48.380]  put something into us that doesn't even work the way they say it does but it
[1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:53.260]  works great in creating prion disease and permanent chronic blood clots if
[1:09:53.260 --> 1:09:58.940]  you're lucky and don't die but a lot of debilitating issues and so he comes out
[1:09:58.940 --> 1:10:01.940]  I'm gonna play the clip in a moment and says you need to be locked in your house
[1:10:01.940 --> 1:10:07.300]  and he doesn't even care how you get food well you know the left calls people
[1:10:07.300 --> 1:10:11.180]  that support America or even having borders or the country even existing as
[1:10:11.180 --> 1:10:16.460]  Nazis but the closest thing I see the Nazis in this country with a censorship
[1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:20.100]  and the forced medical tyranny and saying lock us in our homes as Kathleen
[1:10:20.100 --> 1:10:24.820]  Samillius former head of Health and Human Services said I mean they've all
[1:10:24.820 --> 1:10:29.140]  been saying it the fact that they're doing all this and saying fine just be
[1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:32.900]  fired go home and live in your house then you'll be homeless and then the head
[1:10:32.900 --> 1:10:35.700]  of the CDC said over the weekend go ahead and maybe just put people in
[1:10:35.700 --> 1:10:39.180]  government dormitories and they're building these emergency centers all
[1:10:39.180 --> 1:10:44.140]  over the world to not just put the sick or the unvaccinated but the healthy
[1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:48.940]  people they called it shielding so this is all the state rolling out martial law
[1:10:48.940 --> 1:10:53.700]  the state rolling out medical oppression the end of bodily autonomy it's all the
[1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:57.980]  the Washington Post announcing this is the end of parental rights we've got to
[1:10:57.980 --> 1:11:01.220]  get rid of those and inject children without their consent and now all over
[1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:05.540]  the world including the US ice cream trucks pull up and inject children as
[1:11:05.540 --> 1:11:10.380]  young as six years old and then as those children get sick and die the parents
[1:11:10.380 --> 1:11:14.180]  are gonna fight back and they're being called terrorist since June that's the
[1:11:14.180 --> 1:11:17.340]  official policy US government questioning elections questioning open
[1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:21.380]  borders questioning the vaccines that aren't vaccines questioning new
[1:11:21.380 --> 1:11:25.540]  lockdowns is an act of terror hell go into your school board meeting and not
[1:11:25.540 --> 1:11:29.140]  wanting a convicted pedophile to visit your children or not wanting a man a
[1:11:29.140 --> 1:11:35.140]  skirt to rape your daughter that's all gonna get you an FBI visit well good
[1:11:35.140 --> 1:11:42.340]  come visit us then we're already being raped by the system and now they say oh
[1:11:42.340 --> 1:11:46.540]  we're gonna anybody with over $700 ever in the bank we're gonna watch you okay
[1:11:46.540 --> 1:11:51.260]  it's up to 10,000 well everybody it's got $10,000 welfare recipients are getting
[1:11:51.260 --> 1:11:58.100]  20 grand a year minimum wage is 16,000 a year 40,000 per pay period or per week
[1:11:58.100 --> 1:12:03.060]  40 hours not 40,000 per week 40 hours per week comes out to you do the math
[1:12:03.060 --> 1:12:07.540]  less than 16,000 so everybody's gonna be surveilled everybody's gonna be
[1:12:07.540 --> 1:12:10.980]  controlled everybody's gonna be watched in live time what you can and can't do
[1:12:10.980 --> 1:12:14.500]  social credit score and it's all being announced it's all being rolled out
[1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:18.780]  globally they're laughing about it and then Noam Chomsky crawls out from under
[1:12:18.780 --> 1:12:24.260]  a rock at 90 plus years of age he's anti-gun he's anti-family he is a
[1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:30.700]  status through and through and he says lock Americans up like Jews were locked
[1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:36.980]  up in the ghettos of Germany and the ghettos of Poland and the ghettos of
[1:12:36.980 --> 1:12:42.020]  Hungary and Romania and places like Ukraine including his ancestors he
[1:12:42.020 --> 1:12:48.300]  claims so the closest thing to Hitler is these big corporations and people like
[1:12:48.300 --> 1:12:54.020]  Fauci and all of his secret testing on foster children with HIV drugs and the
[1:12:54.020 --> 1:12:59.140]  and the murder of dogs with flesh-eating insects and all of the other
[1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:03.700]  experimental garbage going on with these shots and now here he comes brutally
[1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:07.380]  with a needle in his hand saying put you in your house he didn't care where you
[1:13:07.380 --> 1:13:14.340]  get food starve your ass to death because you didn't commune with them and
[1:13:14.340 --> 1:13:18.780]  take this poison shot I mean this guy's making a real physical run and
[1:13:18.780 --> 1:13:26.020]  everybody because he's always been a terrorist here it is if people decide I
[1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:33.860]  am willing to be a danger to the community by refusing a vaccine they
[1:13:33.860 --> 1:13:40.420]  should then say well I also have the decency to isolate myself when you talk
[1:13:40.420 --> 1:13:45.380]  about folks having the freedom to you know separate if they don't want to
[1:13:45.380 --> 1:13:48.940]  abide by these vaccine mandates you know how do you think this would
[1:13:48.940 --> 1:13:54.060]  practically play out they should have the decency to remove themselves from
[1:13:54.060 --> 1:14:00.460]  the community if they refuse to do that then measures have to be taken to
[1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:06.100]  safeguard the community from them then comes the practical question that you
[1:14:06.100 --> 1:14:12.660]  ask how can we get food to them well that's actually their problem that's
[1:14:12.660 --> 1:14:17.260]  actually their problem he wants to starve us to death what a nice man by the
[1:14:17.260 --> 1:14:20.020]  way they admit you're more likely to spread COVID if you've been injected
[1:14:20.020 --> 1:14:24.140]  in British and US studies pull it up and it actually erases your immune system
[1:14:24.140 --> 1:14:29.260]  he knows all this this this is a communist folks this is a guy that hates
[1:14:29.260 --> 1:14:37.180]  America this is a parasite this is a this is a person who is no better than
[1:14:37.180 --> 1:14:41.220]  the Nazis that did what they did to so many different groups of people this is
[1:14:41.220 --> 1:14:46.020]  classic naked authoritarianism where he's telling us we're diseased and we're
[1:14:46.020 --> 1:14:52.900]  bad so we've got to be locked up the exact excuse that Adolf Hitler used so
[1:14:52.900 --> 1:14:59.220]  wow talk about coming full circle talk about being a fraud and then you've got
[1:14:59.220 --> 1:15:02.300]  all the big pharma corporations with liability protection trying to do this
[1:15:02.300 --> 1:15:08.420]  and you've got Fauci this historic monster who's been involved in all this
[1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:11.700]  corruption lies and secret experimentation and now there he is
[1:15:11.700 --> 1:15:17.660]  cheerleading for Fauci because Chomsky has always been a self-appointed God
[1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:22.540]  he's always been better than everybody else he's always known what to do and he
[1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:27.180]  looks at you with disdain guaranteed he hadn't taken these shots it's about his
[1:15:27.180 --> 1:15:31.500]  exercise of power over you and taking you to the grave with it that's his
[1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:35.500]  subconscious projection on to you bare minimum and I believe he's conscious of
[1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:40.900]  it but that's my opinion but I do know is he's backing dangerous illegal systems
[1:15:40.900 --> 1:15:44.260]  that violate the Nuremberg code and saying we should be locked in our homes
[1:15:44.260 --> 1:15:49.500]  and food taken away to literally kill us he wants to kill us like every other
[1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:59.340]  dirty communist well guess what scum we don't kill so easy you little maggot I
[1:15:59.340 --> 1:16:05.620]  am taping this update on the morning of Friday October 22nd 2021 listeners who've

[1:18:01.420 --> 1:18:07.140]  so much why do they hate America so much because it's an idea of freedom that
[1:18:07.140 --> 1:18:12.620]  their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very
[1:18:12.620 --> 1:18:17.980]  very simple for their world government their anti-human post-human eugenics
[1:18:17.980 --> 1:18:23.180]  system to flourish freedom and liberty and due process injustice and god-fearing

[1:22:05.780 --> 1:22:09.460]  said in the interview we've got the quotes right here but they've taken the
[1:22:09.460 --> 1:22:15.700]  video down that this turns off your killer white blood cells according to
[1:22:15.700 --> 1:22:19.540]  studies which anybody can pull up and we have pulled up and it lowers your
[1:22:19.540 --> 1:22:23.460]  immunity happy to take the shot to other viruses except it may then raise your
[1:22:23.460 --> 1:22:28.220]  autoimmune response to where it kills you with ADE with any type of corona like
[1:22:28.220 --> 1:22:32.460]  virus so it makes you have a huge autoimmune response and and and die of
[1:22:32.460 --> 1:22:37.180]  shock in many cases with ADE if it's a certain type of virus everything else
[1:22:37.180 --> 1:22:42.540]  just gets right through and so he said that and they took him down but there
[1:22:42.540 --> 1:22:47.820]  the crew have found the censored video
[1:22:48.580 --> 1:22:52.940]  we should probably posted it man dot video but let me just show you some of
[1:22:52.940 --> 1:22:57.500]  what he said being true he pointed out that it's similar to HIV and has HIV

[1:23:34.140 --> 1:23:42.300]  news DW dot com coronavirus contains HIV insertions why an Australian COVID-19
[1:23:42.300 --> 1:23:46.660]  vaccine caused false positives in HIV because it was an attenuated whole
[1:23:46.660 --> 1:23:51.940]  COVID virus that had just been radiated and so the body thought this was HIV
[1:23:51.940 --> 1:23:56.460]  which what does that tell you it tells you that that's why everybody's starting
[1:23:56.460 --> 1:23:59.060]  to freak out that's going out and taking COVID test because sometimes it says you
[1:23:59.060 --> 1:24:03.340]  have HIV because technically you have the virus that causes it but it's been
[1:24:03.340 --> 1:24:07.300]  attenuated as well because they changed it it's only the outside of the virus

[1:30:59.300 --> 1:31:03.340]  mega corporations who've taken over almost every government on earth and

[1:31:08.100 --> 1:31:11.260]  got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted
[1:31:11.260 --> 1:31:17.500]  that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves name of LBGT and African
[1:31:17.500 --> 1:31:21.380]  American rights all the rest of it all over the world that's now their corporate
[1:31:21.380 --> 1:31:25.380]  face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist China and many
[1:31:25.380 --> 1:31:29.420]  other areas while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us
[1:31:29.420 --> 1:31:33.860]  through the big tech the central banks and other zone so this is a criminal
[1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:39.060]  takeover and when you look at the new superclass it's the politicians it's
[1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:43.340]  the corporate media it's the police it's the bureaucrats it's members of
[1:31:43.340 --> 1:31:46.860]  Congress and their staff and their families it's the White House hell it's
[1:31:46.860 --> 1:31:52.780]  postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots but not the general
[1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:56.100]  public and everybody else through corporate rule so this is the true

[1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:38.460]  If you are receiving this transmission
[1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:44.100]  you are the resistance live from Austin, Texas broadcasting
[1:33:44.100 --> 1:34:00.020]  worldwide it's Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we are back live thank you so
[1:34:00.020 --> 1:34:06.980]  much for joining us on this live Tuesday October 26 worldwide broadcast and we are
[1:34:06.980 --> 1:34:13.860]  living in quite a time right now we are we are living just in such insane
[1:34:13.860 --> 1:34:20.500]  times and and medically the general public is in a trench medically that's
[1:34:20.500 --> 1:34:24.380]  the mainline science that's in the major psychological papers because of so much
[1:34:24.380 --> 1:34:29.180]  television watching and so much screen time people are mesmerized to only
[1:34:29.180 --> 1:34:34.380]  interface and only focus on that so you can talk directly to somebody and say
[1:34:34.380 --> 1:34:40.180]  here's a test I want you to remember tomorrow when I give you this task to
[1:34:40.180 --> 1:34:44.660]  put it in the computer so I know about it and no matter what I do they cannot do
[1:34:44.660 --> 1:34:51.460]  it and that's a person that's smart cognitively but cannot get out of the
[1:34:51.460 --> 1:34:57.620]  trained responses you see they know that 95% of thoughts you have about 65,000 a
[1:34:57.620 --> 1:35:03.980]  day on average are subconscious you need to train yourself to have 30 40 50% of
[1:35:03.980 --> 1:35:08.340]  your thoughts being conscious that's what they call being awake versus being
[1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:16.260]  asleep ladies and gentlemen and so so much of this is an inside job so much
[1:35:16.260 --> 1:35:22.340]  of what we need to do as a culture and as a society is an inside job and if we
[1:35:22.340 --> 1:35:29.540]  can't change that as individuals you're not really living you're like a living
[1:35:29.540 --> 1:35:37.420]  dead person and you just shuffle through life in a haze pretending you're awake
[1:35:37.420 --> 1:35:41.700]  and and the subconscious person that's in a trance may be an awake person who's
[1:35:41.700 --> 1:35:46.220]  nice and smart but that person's not actually activated in the real world
[1:35:46.220 --> 1:35:51.700]  the the the fact similarly that the globalist to build is what's operating
[1:35:51.700 --> 1:35:59.500]  out there basically an avatar that the system built for you it's really
[1:35:59.500 --> 1:36:03.900]  incredible to watch how brutal this is and how it works upon people's minds and
[1:36:03.900 --> 1:36:09.460]  then to see people you know fall deeper in to the coma that's why you could type
[1:36:09.460 --> 1:36:12.380]  this into a search engine and click web search and you can find on it was one
[1:36:12.380 --> 1:36:16.660]  back 30 years and major papers before that that the more television you watch
[1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:21.260]  the lower your IQ over time it goes down and that it's associated with
[1:36:21.260 --> 1:36:27.660]  neurological disorders and Alzheimer's early onset of Alzheimer's and if you
[1:36:27.660 --> 1:36:31.300]  look at people that are big TV heads who just kind of sit back and suspend
[1:36:31.300 --> 1:36:35.780]  disbelief and watch fictional television it's the worst they're unable to be
[1:36:35.780 --> 1:36:43.860]  reached because they are in a mesmerized brainwave area and I can't tell you how
[1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:49.140]  many people I know who after the lockdowns and on all of it literally now
[1:36:49.140 --> 1:36:55.620]  aren't the same person after a year of sitting at home watching TV and old and
[1:36:55.620 --> 1:37:05.700]  young you can't get them out of it and listen it gets worse it gets a lot worse
[1:37:06.180 --> 1:37:09.580]  it gets a lot worse we guys have that video ready please put it on screen that
[1:37:09.580 --> 1:37:17.820]  you have it thank you everything it gets a lot a lot worse you see because they've
[1:37:17.820 --> 1:37:29.980]  they've they've gotten the length the do you have it ready oh great that's what I
[1:37:29.980 --> 1:37:33.540]  wanted to know that's what I was asking see that's what oh well that was like
[1:37:33.540 --> 1:37:36.580]  three seconds later no memory I mean like hey when you have that clip tell me
[1:37:36.580 --> 1:37:42.260]  you have it and do it and again this is happening all over the place where
[1:37:42.260 --> 1:37:45.900]  there's not even a memory now there's not even a five second one a 10 second
[1:37:45.900 --> 1:37:52.340]  one a 20 second one and and and the TV is programming that worse and worse and
[1:37:52.340 --> 1:37:59.980]  worse and worse to where people aren't even alive anymore and I don't know what
[1:37:59.980 --> 1:38:03.260]  to do I mean it's just so sad and it's gonna get to the point where the
[1:38:03.260 --> 1:38:06.940]  globalist are just gonna have to exterminate everybody because they've
[1:38:06.940 --> 1:38:13.260]  already brain damaged people so incredibly badly that then they can't
[1:38:13.260 --> 1:38:17.860]  even operate or live through the TVs through the mind control through
[1:38:17.860 --> 1:38:20.980]  everything that's going on in the culture so you know it's just an
[1:38:20.980 --> 1:38:26.500]  absolutely incredible time to be alive and it's a very very amazing time to be
[1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:32.420]  alive and I'm gonna try to regroup here and come back and talk in the next
[1:38:32.420 --> 1:38:37.020]  segment but I specifically am just so sick of knowing what's gonna happen and
[1:38:37.020 --> 1:38:41.740]  then watching it happen like Groundhog Day every single day and and I try to be
[1:38:41.740 --> 1:38:44.300]  positive about all this and a lot of positive things are happening as well
[1:38:44.300 --> 1:38:49.580]  but we need people to become conscious and get out of their regular regular
[1:38:49.580 --> 1:38:56.220]  sane behavior every single day every single moment and become conscious
[1:38:56.220 --> 1:39:02.260]  ladies and gentlemen and and that means like really being awake making yourself
[1:39:02.260 --> 1:39:06.380]  be awake I know it hurts for people that don't do it I know it's painful for
[1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:09.460]  people that don't live in the conscious space but that's how they're getting you
[1:39:09.460 --> 1:39:13.620]  that's how they're controlling you and I didn't know it was such an incredible
[1:39:13.620 --> 1:39:18.580]  gift to be able to stay focused on things but the system walks around while
[1:39:18.580 --> 1:39:21.940]  you're in a trance while you're asleep while you're in the matrix and they are
[1:39:21.940 --> 1:39:27.540]  literally ruling your life and destroying you and it's wrong all right
[1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:30.980]  one of the positive things I can do is try to stay on air air here I can get
[1:39:30.980 --> 1:39:37.900]  that done canna so two announcements I want to make I have been so busy I've
[1:39:37.900 --> 1:39:40.620]  not come up with a new special and that's not a good thing because when we
[1:39:40.620 --> 1:39:42.900]  get a product back in that's been out for a while I like to have it as a
[1:39:42.900 --> 1:39:46.140]  special so folks that are our regular customers can get it a discount but then
[1:39:46.140 --> 1:39:48.580]  because we never have it up the product going out in the future there's some of
[1:39:48.580 --> 1:39:52.820]  the cashmines we've been in and supply chain breakdowns I tend to sell too much
[1:39:52.820 --> 1:39:56.980]  of it at a low price and so we can't sell the majority of it at close to full
[1:39:56.980 --> 1:40:00.460]  price or full price then we have a money issue so I told everybody we can only

[1:43:06.660 --> 1:43:10.420]  come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're
[1:43:10.420 --> 1:43:15.620]  made the image of God the Creator and we are powerful and the social engineers
[1:43:15.620 --> 1:43:20.140]  fear that so much so that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that
[1:43:20.140 --> 1:43:26.940]  nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not
[1:43:26.940 --> 1:43:32.660]  be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and
[1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:37.740]  all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they
[1:43:37.740 --> 1:43:41.980]  know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God of this
[1:43:41.980 --> 1:43:46.180]  world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info
[1:43:46.180 --> 1:43:49.340]  wars on the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in God
[1:43:49.340 --> 1:43:54.980]  but the globalist are manifesting setting up and we are opposing the one
[1:43:54.980 --> 1:43:58.260]  world government and the mark of the beast they just announced in late
[1:43:58.260 --> 1:44:04.460]  August info war saw an explosion of orders because our audience understands
[1:44:04.460 --> 1:44:09.860]  that the globalist are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to
[1:44:09.860 --> 1:44:14.820]  cause an economic and financial collapse worldwide now ladies and gentlemen

[1:45:03.540 --> 1:45:08.180]  their agenda I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:45:08.180 --> 1:45:12.540]  before they went operational but we failed yes a lot of people are awake
[1:45:12.540 --> 1:45:17.100]  yes we're not getting caught flat footed but they are going ahead with
[1:45:17.100 --> 1:45:21.180]  their full operational the industrialization great reset and that's
[1:45:21.180 --> 1:45:24.940]  why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell

[1:46:18.940 --> 1:46:24.420]  for decades oil companies and other major chemical corporations have been
[1:46:24.420 --> 1:46:29.700]  using patented naturally occurring specially bred bacteria to eat oil
[1:46:29.700 --> 1:46:35.220]  spills and other toxic waste disasters that's how powerful these naturally
[1:46:35.220 --> 1:46:39.740]  occurring microbes are the bio pro system is light years better than
[1:46:39.740 --> 1:46:44.620]  traditional enzymes that only work once these bacteria begin to breed and live

[1:47:46.740 --> 1:47:50.260]  attacked and demonized but that's a badge of honor I just hope all of you
[1:47:50.260 --> 1:47:53.580]  know that everything going on today everything unfolding right now is not
[1:47:53.580 --> 1:47:57.780]  normal and is not good and is part of normalizing and assault on you
[1:47:57.780 --> 1:48:04.820]  physically and economically and spiritually by these sick freaks so

[1:53:12.420 --> 1:53:16.220]  they're finally ending all this tyranny of the last 21 months no you asked to
[1:53:16.220 --> 1:53:20.940]  reopen air travel but demand vaccine pass with approved jabs negative test
[1:53:20.940 --> 1:53:25.740]  from foreign visitors and when you go to Europe you've got to have the jab or the
[1:53:25.740 --> 1:53:31.860]  test and it's a unified global you in controlled digital vaccine passport to
[1:53:31.860 --> 1:53:35.340]  where when you leave you got to do it when they come they got to do it and
[1:53:35.340 --> 1:53:40.460]  then they catch everybody in the process you have a global medical vaccine
[1:53:40.460 --> 1:53:44.340]  passport that forms the heart of the global social credit score the carbon
[1:53:44.340 --> 1:53:47.580]  taxes and all the rest of it and actually have a clip on that let's pull
[1:53:47.580 --> 1:53:51.540]  that clip up if we can this is the inventor of the social credit score
[1:53:51.540 --> 1:53:59.820]  we've been reporting on since 2004 this is Lynn Jin Yu clip 3 lead designer of
[1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:04.900]  China's social credit score extols its value and his hope for worldwide
[1:54:04.900 --> 1:54:09.620]  adoption so that quote you won't have things like the yellow vest protest and
[1:54:09.620 --> 1:54:13.820]  other protest happening around the world you know the anti-vax protest because
[1:54:13.820 --> 1:54:20.180]  you will have your house taken and be made homeless if you don't do with the
[1:54:20.180 --> 1:54:24.780]  social credit control system says and of course no Chomsky says you've got to be
[1:54:24.780 --> 1:54:28.820]  locked in your house and have no food so that's who these people are the bad
[1:54:28.820 --> 1:54:32.820]  guys the dangerous guys the guys that if they get control of your life and have
[1:54:32.820 --> 1:54:38.780]  something like this over you will abuse it and we'll use it against you so here's
[1:54:38.780 --> 1:54:45.860]  what he had to say it's got an English subtitles I think we had to put in
[1:54:45.860 --> 1:54:51.660]  place a goal a good start over again sorry I messed up I messed it up let me
[1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:54.860]  just try to get focused it's hard to read at this distance but go ahead and play
[1:54:54.860 --> 1:55:03.460]  it I think that we have to put in place a good technological method I really
[1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:07.580]  hope that we will use and manage to export you know I'm not gonna be able to
[1:55:07.580 --> 1:55:11.300]  read it it's just too quick let's just try it again back at the beginning again
[1:55:11.300 --> 1:55:13.980]  go ahead and bring it to me let's just take a little pause of enjoyment here
[1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:18.740]  come on bring me the paper it's all right no problem thanks again I promised
[1:55:18.740 --> 1:55:21.740]  myself when I started having any issues I may have to leave but I got Dr. Fleming
[1:55:21.740 --> 1:55:26.420]  coming up here but I'm really I'm really trying I'm really fighting right now
[1:55:29.980 --> 1:55:41.700]  okay let's just do this let's just pause it during each slide and then I can
[1:55:41.700 --> 1:55:45.060]  just read what he has to say that way because he's talking fast and Chinese I
[1:55:45.060 --> 1:55:49.340]  can't read the American subtitles I know it's English subtitles folks that's a
[1:55:49.340 --> 1:55:58.140]  joke I go ahead and play the first slide please I think that we have to put in
[1:55:58.140 --> 1:56:12.740]  place a good technological method I really hope that we will manage to
[1:56:12.740 --> 1:56:22.100]  export it to a capitalist country I think that France should quickly adopt a
[1:56:22.100 --> 1:56:37.940]  social credit system by regressing social housing very funny if you have had
[1:56:37.940 --> 1:56:47.820]  the social credit system there would never have been the yellow vest we
[1:56:47.820 --> 1:56:59.020]  would have detected that and stopped it an acted one could have foreseen it these
[1:56:59.020 --> 1:57:10.740]  events would not have happened it is one of the great advantages of the social
[1:57:10.740 --> 1:57:19.660]  credit system now the reason I played all of that obnoxiously is people say
[1:57:19.660 --> 1:57:22.580]  that's not gonna happen they already are rolling out the vaccine passport which
[1:57:22.580 --> 1:57:26.060]  they admit as a social credit score which they admit is your carbon score
[1:57:26.060 --> 1:57:28.940]  it's already here that's what's rolling out while they're trying to make you get
[1:57:28.940 --> 1:57:31.780]  it that's why Hillary and George Soros and all of them want you to have it and
[1:57:31.780 --> 1:57:36.140]  George Soros has rolled out yet another program to quote silence this
[1:57:36.140 --> 1:57:40.180]  information that's any group opposing him and him and Bill Gates own the new
[1:57:40.180 --> 1:57:44.380]  globally you and approved COVID testing system with blood tests they're gonna
[1:57:44.380 --> 1:57:53.500]  make you take Alex Jones here on the morning of Friday October 22nd 2021
[1:57:53.500 --> 1:57:58.580]  with a very important update for supporters of info wars several of our

[1:58:45.180 --> 1:58:50.460]  to support the M4 at infowarstore.com I'm sitting here it's in the early
[1:58:50.460 --> 1:58:56.620]  morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news reporting on the fact
[1:58:56.620 --> 1:59:00.940]  that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said that the
[1:59:00.940 --> 1:59:05.180]  Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for children
[1:59:05.180 --> 1:59:09.220]  because he and studies they did on children it caused myocarditis that
[1:59:09.220 --> 1:59:13.300]  starts swelling and heart attacks and then I noticed that even though this is
[1:59:13.300 --> 1:59:17.220]  even in the Associated Press it's not getting any circulation it's not on the
[1:59:17.220 --> 1:59:20.580]  national news and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or
[1:59:20.580 --> 1:59:26.100]  Twitter it's just crazy and then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no
[1:59:26.100 --> 1:59:29.860]  damage from the vaccines it doesn't hurt anybody your conspiracy theorists if
[1:59:29.860 --> 1:59:33.820]  you say it it's just crazy and then we have all the scientists who over a
[1:59:33.820 --> 1:59:36.780]  year ago came out and said these vaccines are gonna cause heart problems
[1:59:36.780 --> 1:59:41.460]  they gave the exact reasons why and now it happens that's why info wars is on
[1:59:41.460 --> 1:59:45.300]  air because if we weren't on air they get away with even more of this crap this
[1:59:45.300 --> 1:59:48.900]  is just insane these people are killers
[1:59:48.900 --> 2:00:11.660]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[2:00:11.660 --> 2:00:16.100]  you got to get out of our comfort zones ladies and gentlemen but admit we're
[2:00:16.100 --> 2:00:21.220]  under a modern form of attack the fact that they incrementally attack us is
[2:00:21.220 --> 2:00:25.460]  designed that we never actually wake up and and transcend what they're doing and
[2:00:25.460 --> 2:00:31.420]  just say no at every level oh so big tech sensors members are constant
[2:00:31.420 --> 2:00:35.340]  governors well that's the way it is oh yeah the shots kill a bunch of people
[2:00:35.340 --> 2:00:40.620]  okay and it make a class and die a big deal here's part of the 32 report that's
[2:00:40.620 --> 2:00:45.180]  featured at man dot video with so bombshell with dr. Richard Fleming and
[2:00:45.180 --> 2:00:48.620]  his findings with these other research scientists we're gonna air the first five
[2:00:48.620 --> 2:00:51.820]  minutes of this and then we're gonna come back from break and talk to Fleming
[2:00:51.820 --> 2:00:57.020]  live but if you go to band dot video here I'll just show you go to band dot
[2:00:57.020 --> 2:01:03.060]  video you can see it there it is info wars exclusive presentation medical
[2:01:03.060 --> 2:01:10.220]  bombshell Pfizer vax attacks human blood creating clots observable under
[2:01:10.220 --> 2:01:16.700]  microscope and that thing just went live this morning and we interviewed him
[2:01:16.700 --> 2:01:21.140]  last night then put it together and it's just what all the other studies
[2:01:21.140 --> 2:01:25.540]  everything else I just showed you admit so remember they're just setting the
[2:01:25.540 --> 2:01:29.180]  president an experimental injection is out there and then it's used on us and
[2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:35.380]  here's a part of that presentation all right well hello everyone I wanted to go
[2:01:35.380 --> 2:01:39.980]  over some very important information on the stars could be to drug vaccines by
[2:01:39.980 --> 2:01:45.700]  taking a microscopic examination of really what the Pfizer vaccine does when
[2:01:45.700 --> 2:01:49.380]  it comes into contact with red blood cells or a person's blood and the
[2:01:49.380 --> 2:01:53.780]  concerns that I've had with these the investigation that you're going to see
[2:01:53.780 --> 2:02:00.940]  was a combined project between Dr. Kevin McCarron PhD neurobiologist in Japan
[2:02:00.940 --> 2:02:07.700]  originally from the UK and myself and we did this in the last several days
[2:02:07.700 --> 2:02:12.140]  actually one of the sides that I like to share with people is that the
[2:02:12.140 --> 2:02:16.740]  difference between a PhD MD JD is that PhDs actually figure out problems while
[2:02:16.740 --> 2:02:21.820]  MDs treat them and JDs typically cause them in this presentation we believe
[2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:29.780]  will have all three effects for the last 22 months there has been a huge amount of
[2:02:29.780 --> 2:02:34.980]  misinformation so much that you know it's it's phenomenal how much misinformation
[2:02:34.980 --> 2:02:38.820]  versus real information has gotten out there including people who've said that
[2:02:38.820 --> 2:02:44.260]  the virus isn't real and hasn't been isolated to people confusing virus or
[2:02:44.260 --> 2:02:49.700]  scoby-2 with the disease COVID-19 to misinformation about PCR testing and
[2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:54.140]  misinformation about masking to confusion between the use of terms like
[2:02:54.140 --> 2:02:58.260]  cytokine storm versus inflammatory robotic response which is what's really
[2:02:58.260 --> 2:03:02.820]  going on to people being told to take certain drugs that there's absolutely no
[2:03:02.820 --> 2:03:08.500]  proof that they work while other people are being told that other medications that
[2:03:08.500 --> 2:03:13.980]  do work can't be provided all the way from there to doctors not treating
[2:03:13.980 --> 2:03:17.820]  symptomatic patients until it's too late to physicians using the ventilators
[2:03:17.820 --> 2:03:22.500]  incorrectly to doctors being threatened if they actually try to treat patients
[2:03:22.500 --> 2:03:27.100]  with loss of their license or legal actions to the promotion of vaccines
[2:03:27.100 --> 2:03:30.700]  that the emergency use authorization documents actually showed you not
[2:03:30.700 --> 2:03:36.020]  statistically lowered the instance of COVID or deaths to a failure to provide
[2:03:36.020 --> 2:03:41.420]  informed consent for people receiving the vaccines to individuals overstepping
[2:03:41.420 --> 2:03:45.300]  their constitutional legal authority including mandates to blaming the
[2:03:45.300 --> 2:03:49.540]  unvaccinated for the promulgation of vaccines that actually people claiming
[2:03:49.540 --> 2:03:52.900]  there are things in the vaccines that simply aren't there and so it's this
[2:03:52.900 --> 2:03:56.460]  latter one that we really want to look at today because there is so much
[2:03:56.460 --> 2:04:00.380]  misinformation about what's in the vaccines all the way from the pictures
[2:04:00.380 --> 2:04:06.220]  at the upper left-hand corner that talk about graphene oxide and and to the
[2:04:06.220 --> 2:04:10.260]  right of that little creatures the video here that we won't play at this
[2:04:10.260 --> 2:04:19.420]  point in time is from a Dr. Zellowski Z-A-L-E-W-S-K-I who was giving a
[2:04:19.420 --> 2:04:23.380]  presentation explaining that he had found the eggs of these creatures and
[2:04:23.380 --> 2:04:29.380]  they're three legged creatures a lot of misinformation is simple and has not
[2:04:29.380 --> 2:04:33.820]  done nothing to add to the scientific discussion and the important
[2:04:33.820 --> 2:04:37.780]  discussion about what's in these vaccines I've been concerned about the
[2:04:37.780 --> 2:04:44.380]  vaccines themselves and so you can see here that I sent Dr. Borla on the 30th
[2:04:44.380 --> 2:04:48.340]  of January the first request for Pfizer information on the emergency use
[2:04:48.340 --> 2:04:51.860]  authorization alright folks Dr. Fleming's gonna join us live with these
[2:04:51.860 --> 2:04:57.260]  incredible documented findings please stay with us tell people tune in I am
[2:04:57.260 --> 2:05:01.460]  taping this up you're listening to this message in the weekend of Friday

[2:06:13.060 --> 2:06:16.380]  to Alex Jones
[2:06:16.380 --> 2:06:22.820]  alright my friends here is the big news here is the big incredibly important
[2:06:22.820 --> 2:06:27.820]  guest and information Dr. Richard Fleming Fleming method.com is joining us
[2:06:27.820 --> 2:06:32.780]  he is a cardiologist nuclear cardiologist certified in Posteron
[2:06:32.780 --> 2:06:38.220]  emission tomography jurist prudence doctor of law researcher inventor and
[2:06:38.220 --> 2:06:42.340]  author I'm not going to go over his prestigious background or his
[2:06:42.340 --> 2:06:47.460]  development of major medical devices and more Fleming method.com but his site
[2:06:47.460 --> 2:06:51.700]  is the best site that keeps track of all the major studies I've seen around the
[2:06:51.700 --> 2:06:58.180]  world and John Hopkins and the UN's own trackers showing indeed what these
[2:06:58.180 --> 2:07:04.620]  franken injections are doing now he has been trying for a very long time he'll
[2:07:04.620 --> 2:07:08.180]  give you all the details to get the FDA who's not been doing really public
[2:07:08.180 --> 2:07:11.700]  trials to release information and now we know the people have gotten sick and
[2:07:11.700 --> 2:07:15.860]  died in the trials and now lawsuits are being filed over that but he was able to
[2:07:15.860 --> 2:07:20.820]  get the so-called vaccine and have it studied by other renowned laboratory
[2:07:20.820 --> 2:07:25.460]  scientists and he's now published and listed that information in a detailed
[2:07:25.460 --> 2:07:30.940]  slideshow that he premiered in a report that just went live this morning at
[2:07:30.940 --> 2:07:36.940]  freeworldnews.tv and we can put that live at freeworldnews.tv and show the
[2:07:36.940 --> 2:07:41.540]  TV viewers that actual headline so they can see it on screen but that is a
[2:07:41.540 --> 2:07:48.700]  headline that I gave it this morning after I saw the crew put it together and
[2:07:48.700 --> 2:07:55.900]  so I would just hope that Dr. Fleming will give us a better headline for
[2:07:55.900 --> 2:08:00.740]  what he thinks this really means but medical bombshell Pfizer Vax attacks
[2:08:00.740 --> 2:08:06.620]  human blood creating clots under microscope now this is backed up by
[2:08:06.620 --> 2:08:10.380]  over a hundred mainline articles I showed you last hour about warnings on
[2:08:10.380 --> 2:08:16.380]  the vaccines about causing clots microcardi is all the rest of it but now
[2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:20.220]  they've actually tested it directly on the blood in vitro to show what's
[2:08:20.220 --> 2:08:23.900]  happening there and then tested other things to compare the two and of course
[2:08:23.900 --> 2:08:27.780]  he's the scientist and the doctor so I'm gonna let him take over with this
[2:08:27.780 --> 2:08:33.860]  information now and if you'd like to walk back through the basic findings that's
[2:08:33.860 --> 2:08:38.340]  fine but also just what this is an American as a citizen as a human what
[2:08:38.340 --> 2:08:42.060]  this signifies and where he thinks this is going because the wheels are coming
[2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:46.700]  off on Fauci and Wuhan and lying and doing all these torturous experiments on
[2:08:46.700 --> 2:08:50.340]  puppies and monkeys and now they're testing experimental stuff on us and
[2:08:50.340 --> 2:08:54.660]  trying to make us take it I mean this is just a mad scientist science fiction
[2:08:54.660 --> 2:08:59.180]  movie come true so again dr. Fleming thanks so much for coming on with us
[2:08:59.180 --> 2:09:02.820]  my pleasure to be here Alex thank you for the invitation well thank you for
[2:09:02.820 --> 2:09:06.940]  your courage to go out and do this so where should we start what you asked the
[2:09:06.940 --> 2:09:10.580]  FDA why you were forced to do this how you're able to actually get some of the
[2:09:10.580 --> 2:09:15.700]  so-called vaccine and what you discovered right well we've been looking at
[2:09:15.700 --> 2:09:20.260]  the vaccines for a little while now several months ago we did some initial
[2:09:20.260 --> 2:09:24.660]  analysis looking for graphing to see if that was available or present in the
[2:09:24.660 --> 2:09:30.220]  vaccines because of all the rumors and speculation by people and those initial
[2:09:30.220 --> 2:09:34.140]  evaluations we did in the United States and we did in Europe and we didn't see
[2:09:34.140 --> 2:09:39.620]  the the graphene that people were talking about back in January I started
[2:09:39.620 --> 2:09:44.700]  asking Pfizer and Moderna very specifically to address concerns that I
[2:09:44.700 --> 2:09:49.100]  had about antibody dependent enhancement and the spike proteins
[2:09:49.100 --> 2:09:52.980]  crossing the blood-brain barrier and these lipid nanoparticles transferring
[2:09:52.980 --> 2:09:56.660]  across the blood-brain barrier and the evidence that showed that the vaccines
[2:09:56.660 --> 2:10:01.020]  don't stay at the site of injection they go all throughout the body the data is
[2:10:01.020 --> 2:10:06.820]  very very clear on that so I sent letters to both Pfizer and Moderna I sent
[2:10:06.820 --> 2:10:12.060]  at three different times which is kind of the standard for law for JD's to do
[2:10:12.060 --> 2:10:15.540]  to to guarantee that communication has been there they
[2:10:15.540 --> 2:10:21.060]  it didn't respond back I met with a group of other positions and scientists
[2:10:21.060 --> 2:10:27.420]  several months ago and we formulated a letter that I eventually put together
[2:10:27.420 --> 2:10:32.180]  and signed and then had the names of several other individuals as you see in
[2:10:32.180 --> 2:10:36.820]  the slide presentation agree with that and we sent it off to the FDA and it
[2:10:36.820 --> 2:10:40.740]  turned out that last week at the same time that we were investigating the
[2:10:40.740 --> 2:10:45.060]  blood the letter came back from the FDA where the FDA said they were happy with
[2:10:45.060 --> 2:10:48.780]  the products of the vaccines that their job was to take care of the American
[2:10:48.780 --> 2:10:52.540]  public and make sure these vaccines are safe and they were satisfied with the
[2:10:52.540 --> 2:10:58.020]  safety of these vaccines and thank you ever so much for our concern the timing
[2:10:58.020 --> 2:11:04.260]  on that was just perfect because we had Dr. McCarron had acquired some additional
[2:11:04.260 --> 2:11:09.700]  vaccines and he had done some initial look to see what the vaccines might do
[2:11:09.700 --> 2:11:14.740]  and then we proceeded four or five days ago to very methodically carry through
[2:11:14.740 --> 2:11:19.780]  the steps that a research scientist would do which is to take blood samples
[2:11:19.780 --> 2:11:23.660]  and look at it under a microscope doing nothing more to the blood than just
[2:11:23.660 --> 2:11:28.820]  leaving the blood alone so you could see it and we recorded it in this
[2:11:28.820 --> 2:11:32.140]  presentation so you can actually see what we're looking at when we look at
[2:11:32.140 --> 2:11:35.940]  through a microscope and then took some still pictures so you can compare and
[2:11:35.940 --> 2:11:40.460]  then ask the fundamental question well what happens if you take something like
[2:11:40.460 --> 2:11:43.780]  normal saline that shouldn't have an adverse effect on the blood and you
[2:11:43.780 --> 2:11:48.220]  add that to the blood well you can see for yourself that the blood moves around
[2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:52.020]  a little bit because the the saline added to it it's a fluid but it doesn't
[2:11:52.020 --> 2:11:59.380]  damage the blood we then proceeded to add Pfizer BioNTech to it and what you
[2:11:59.380 --> 2:12:05.700]  see in in less than a minute is the red color of the red blood cells goes away
[2:12:05.700 --> 2:12:10.140]  they become pale and that means that either the oxygen is being stripped out
[2:12:10.140 --> 2:12:13.580]  of the red blood cells or the hemoglobin that holds the oxygen is being
[2:12:13.580 --> 2:12:18.460]  stripped out of the red blood cells or both and then as you continue to watch
[2:12:18.460 --> 2:12:22.420]  it over the course of a minute or two you see the blood start to clot and that
[2:12:22.420 --> 2:12:27.860]  there's a nice example two different examples on the left or the very pale
[2:12:27.860 --> 2:12:32.500]  red blood cells compared to the vibrant red blood cells to the right of that and
[2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:36.980]  then in the circle you can actually see an oval droplet of red blood cells that
[2:12:36.980 --> 2:12:41.420]  are actually immersed in a in a Pfizer vaccine droplet and you can compare that
[2:12:41.420 --> 2:12:48.020]  that loss of red vibrant color to the red color around it so we did this several
[2:12:48.020 --> 2:12:51.900]  times there you can see the red blood cells simply moving on their own so you
[2:12:51.900 --> 2:12:55.620]  can see what it really looks like if your viewers have never seen red blood
[2:12:55.620 --> 2:12:59.380]  cells under a microscope this is fundamental to answering the questions
[2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:03.580]  what happens to the blood if you add the vaccine to it and that's really what
[2:13:03.580 --> 2:13:08.620]  we looked at and then we added then we looked under the microscope just at the
[2:13:08.620 --> 2:13:13.900]  Pfizer vaccine and just at normal saline and compared that and there aren't any
[2:13:13.900 --> 2:13:17.940]  little creatures in there there isn't any nanotechnology put in there there
[2:13:17.940 --> 2:13:24.260]  isn't any graphing there are crystals like this you can see a lot of
[2:13:24.260 --> 2:13:28.900]  contaminant in this a lot of garbage in the Pfizer vaccines and we had you know
[2:13:28.900 --> 2:13:34.100]  five different vials that we looked at this is just one example of of artifact
[2:13:34.100 --> 2:13:38.820]  and garbage and and fibers that are present in the vaccine none of this meets
[2:13:38.820 --> 2:13:46.020]  industry accepted standards for ejecting this vaccine into a human being and the
[2:13:46.020 --> 2:13:49.780]  later images were yeah that's a fiber that he's pointing out there and another
[2:13:49.780 --> 2:13:55.260]  fiber I mean this should not be in the vaccine this is garbage this is
[2:13:55.260 --> 2:14:00.300]  unacceptable and for the for the FDA to say we're happy with it we've looked at
[2:14:00.300 --> 2:14:05.540]  it it meets all of our our expectations for a manufactured product this this
[2:14:05.540 --> 2:14:09.660]  doesn't meet the qualifications for injecting this into anything on the
[2:14:09.660 --> 2:14:15.900]  planet except possibly a rock something that's already dead and then we looked
[2:14:15.900 --> 2:14:19.180]  at the normal saline and you don't see this garbage you see what looks like a
[2:14:19.180 --> 2:14:26.380]  clean product which is just the solution so you know we're left with the
[2:14:26.380 --> 2:14:32.060]  evidence before us which is that when the Pfizer vaccine is added to blood it
[2:14:32.060 --> 2:14:36.220]  takes away the ability of the blood to hold oxygen now the function of the red
[2:14:36.220 --> 2:14:42.300]  blood cells is twofold to carry oxygen out to the body and to pick up garbage
[2:14:42.300 --> 2:14:46.780]  waste products carbon dioxide and take it back to the lungs to blown off so if
[2:14:46.780 --> 2:14:50.300]  the red blood cells are damaged so they can't carry oxygen they're clearly not
[2:14:50.300 --> 2:14:53.820]  going to be able to carry carbon dioxide once they're damaged like that they're
[2:14:53.820 --> 2:14:59.620]  useless they're sticking around for 120 days on average 90 to 120 days these red
[2:14:59.620 --> 2:15:03.980]  blood cells lose their ability to function to carry oxygen that's necessary
[2:15:03.980 --> 2:15:07.700]  for you to live and carry carbon dioxide to get it out of your body that's
[2:15:07.700 --> 2:15:12.340]  necessary for you to blow it off and you can see when you look at that why
[2:15:12.340 --> 2:15:16.780]  somebody would suddenly get so short of breath and have difficulty breathing and
[2:15:16.780 --> 2:15:20.140]  putting them on a ventilator isn't going to get oxygen to attach those red
[2:15:20.140 --> 2:15:25.420]  blood cells those red blood cells are damaged and to do this to mass vaccinate
[2:15:25.420 --> 2:15:30.060]  people with a product like this it is unconscionable well dr. Fleming this is
[2:15:30.060 --> 2:15:34.700]  just beyond bombshell of all the insane covetous we put out dealing with the
[2:15:34.700 --> 2:15:38.580]  technicals of it this is the most powerful and insane yet and your findings
[2:15:38.580 --> 2:15:41.860]  are exactly what fits with what it's been doing to people and what warnings
[2:15:41.860 --> 2:15:46.820]  they've had to put on it now so where do we go from here with with the FDA saying
[2:15:46.820 --> 2:15:49.980]  this is the best things in sliced bread where a bunch of countries are banning it
[2:15:49.980 --> 2:15:54.820]  because it's doing exactly what you're finding show we'll do right back
[2:15:54.820 --> 2:16:00.020]  hey everybody the average person on the face of this incredible planet is still
[2:16:00.020 --> 2:16:04.780]  unaware there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one
[2:16:04.780 --> 2:16:09.460]  side and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post
[2:16:09.460 --> 2:16:13.260]  human world for the United States of Brazil and of course triggered by the
[2:16:13.260 --> 2:16:17.580]  president the UK nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist
[2:16:17.580 --> 2:16:21.340]  world government that's why they launched their great recess and their
[2:16:21.340 --> 2:16:27.100]  program after collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a
[2:16:27.100 --> 2:16:32.620]  top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take
[2:16:32.620 --> 2:16:37.220]  our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this
[2:16:37.220 --> 2:16:42.820]  world government system could win they released a biological weapon on us now
[2:16:42.820 --> 2:16:47.580]  we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple
[2:16:47.580 --> 2:16:51.220]  they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns so the global
[2:16:51.220 --> 2:16:55.340]  corporate combine released over 19 and you know the rest is history expose this
[2:16:55.340 --> 2:17:02.980]  paradigm and we win God created each and every one of us with free will but we
[2:17:02.980 --> 2:17:06.420]  look at the world system now openly announcing the mark of the beast
[2:17:06.420 --> 2:17:11.260]  everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free
[2:17:11.260 --> 2:17:15.780]  will and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies are very
[2:17:15.780 --> 2:17:23.980]  productivity are very genetics are very future over to them they want control
[2:17:23.980 --> 2:17:27.940]  of procreation they want control of the relationships between men and women they
[2:17:27.940 --> 2:17:33.860]  want to bring a form of living death to our society in our civilization all of
[2:17:33.860 --> 2:17:39.340]  us were formed and made in God's mind in God's image and given free will and make
[2:17:39.340 --> 2:17:43.500]  no mistake all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this
[2:17:43.500 --> 2:17:47.820]  special time so that you could make the right decision free will and stand
[2:17:47.820 --> 2:17:54.860]  against evil and then fraternity win the great birthright prize of being
[2:17:54.860 --> 2:18:00.740]  aligned with God we've all heard about the pastor in his famous statement from
[2:18:00.740 --> 2:18:04.980]  inside a concentration camp in World War two that when they came for one group
[2:18:04.980 --> 2:18:08.500]  he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for
[2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:12.220]  another group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally
[2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:16.420]  and they came for him those nobody else stand up well the global social credit
[2:18:16.420 --> 2:18:19.380]  score that China's putting in it's banning people to three hours of video
[2:18:19.380 --> 2:18:22.740]  games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or sell
[2:18:22.740 --> 2:18:26.420]  again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the
[2:18:26.420 --> 2:18:30.500]  guise of COVID vaccine passports they even admit it now they're saying it's
[2:18:30.500 --> 2:18:33.860]  going to be a carbon tax attached to it they're gonna track where you go what
[2:18:33.860 --> 2:18:38.180]  you do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's the lockdowns are
[2:18:38.180 --> 2:18:43.380]  about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the left is having fun
[2:18:43.380 --> 2:18:46.340]  right now while the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of
[2:18:46.340 --> 2:18:49.300]  the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as
[2:18:49.300 --> 2:18:53.260]  well we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will
[2:18:53.260 --> 2:18:57.700]  be enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalists by now you've heard
[2:18:57.700 --> 2:19:01.460]  me talk about the bio probes and how they're creating amazing products they've
[2:19:01.460 --> 2:19:06.620]  done it again and have just released an entire suite of bio radiation products
[2:19:06.620 --> 2:19:10.380]  bringing industrial level technology to the everyday consumer they're
[2:19:10.380 --> 2:19:14.180]  literally changing the industry with a revolutionary patented delivery system
[2:19:14.180 --> 2:19:19.580]  the bio pros are excited to release bio drain pro a product specifically designed

[2:19:52.420 --> 2:19:55.220]  and see for yourself
[2:19:55.220 --> 2:20:04.260]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:04.260 --> 2:20:06.260]  you
[2:20:23.740 --> 2:20:27.220]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen I want to just thank the listeners and the
[2:20:27.220 --> 2:20:32.660]  viewers and our affiliates and the incredible crew who make this broadcast
[2:20:32.660 --> 2:20:35.980]  so incredibly informative and powerful and the crew that set up here late last
[2:20:35.980 --> 2:20:40.340]  night and early this morning working with myself and others to get dr.
[2:20:40.340 --> 2:20:45.180]  Fleming's report out early this morning Matt and everybody else know who you are
[2:20:45.180 --> 2:20:50.980]  just the best crew in the world and we're working 16 plus hours a day here
[2:20:50.980 --> 2:20:54.900]  because this is so historical dr. Richard Fleming again as our guest is a
[2:20:54.900 --> 2:21:00.140]  shorter segment longer segments coming up but sir this is just unbelievable and
[2:21:00.140 --> 2:21:05.660]  and we know from previous studies of similar mRNA type drugs they had caused
[2:21:05.660 --> 2:21:09.060]  similar blood clotting problems and liver failure and things and I know
[2:21:09.060 --> 2:21:14.260]  you're a multi-discipline doctor and scientist here but were you expecting
[2:21:14.260 --> 2:21:18.980]  something this radical because I'm not a scientist like you but a layperson I
[2:21:18.980 --> 2:21:24.500]  would call it a chain reaction in the blood a you know almost like an enzyme
[2:21:24.500 --> 2:21:29.380]  level shift to watch the blood go from oxygenated red alive in the petri dish
[2:21:29.380 --> 2:21:36.820]  you know or in the injector in a minute turning unoxidated dead brown and to know
[2:21:36.820 --> 2:21:41.260]  it's in well I mean we know sometimes doesn't hurt people sometimes they have
[2:21:41.260 --> 2:21:45.860]  convulsions and collapse right on the spot I mean from all the mechanisms that
[2:21:45.860 --> 2:21:49.980]  we already know about with with what's in these mRNA shots to the best of your
[2:21:49.980 --> 2:21:56.380]  knowledge what's happening here yeah so the best explanation that we have right
[2:21:56.380 --> 2:22:00.500]  now is that it's clearly just going in and damaging the hemoglobin I mean that
[2:22:00.500 --> 2:22:04.780]  would be the fastest way in which you could force the oxygen to get off because
[2:22:04.780 --> 2:22:10.140]  the oxygen has a huge affinity for the hemoglobin so our speculation at this
[2:22:10.140 --> 2:22:15.460]  one in time is that something is going in and just ripping apart or damaging or
[2:22:15.460 --> 2:22:19.940]  changing the structure of the hemoglobin making a completely useless red
[2:22:19.940 --> 2:22:24.180]  blood cell and you know those red blood cells there are the only cells in the
[2:22:24.180 --> 2:22:27.540]  body that don't have a nucleus so they're not replacing themselves there
[2:22:27.540 --> 2:22:31.180]  they're being made in the bone marrow they're out in your bloodstream for 90
[2:22:31.180 --> 2:22:37.100]  to 120 days and they're just becoming useless you know I put the theory
[2:22:37.100 --> 2:22:41.620]  together in 1994 explaining all of this this inflammatory robotic response but
[2:22:41.620 --> 2:22:45.260]  you're right never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be able to just look
[2:22:45.260 --> 2:22:51.300]  under a microscope and watch the process happens so rapidly I mean that that
[2:22:51.300 --> 2:22:55.300]  wasn't the expectation but what we wanted to do was to know what really
[2:22:55.300 --> 2:23:00.020]  happened when the vaccine hit the blood and we very methodically looked at the
[2:23:00.020 --> 2:23:03.700]  blood made sure that you know people could see what the blood looked like
[2:23:03.700 --> 2:23:07.700]  that it didn't change on its own that the normal saline didn't change it and
[2:23:07.700 --> 2:23:12.140]  but but the Pfizer vaccine immediately did that I mean clearly what needs to be
[2:23:12.140 --> 2:23:16.420]  done here is for the FDA to do the job that they're supposed to be doing which
[2:23:16.420 --> 2:23:21.820]  is to review what the drug does I mean you can't claim to be in charge of
[2:23:21.820 --> 2:23:25.860]  health and safety in the United States and guarantee products if you've got
[2:23:25.860 --> 2:23:30.980]  garbage like this in the vaccine that by itself just the garbage would make it
[2:23:30.980 --> 2:23:34.900]  unconscionable to be injecting this into people but seeing what it does to the
[2:23:34.900 --> 2:23:39.260]  blood I mean this is the fundamental science that should be going on and you
[2:23:39.260 --> 2:23:44.380]  don't take other people's word for this you carry out the research yourself you
[2:23:44.380 --> 2:23:48.740]  know that's how I was trained as a physicist and as a position which was
[2:23:48.740 --> 2:23:53.340]  to never take somebody else's word for it to carry out the job yourself and
[2:23:53.340 --> 2:23:56.740]  considering the number of people that are affected the number of people that
[2:23:56.740 --> 2:24:01.100]  have been injured the number of people that are dead to not have carried this
[2:24:01.100 --> 2:24:07.100]  out is is is criminal it's criminal and you know we've been trying to explain for
[2:24:07.100 --> 2:24:10.380]  some time that this gain of function was going on that was clear from the
[2:24:10.380 --> 2:24:14.820]  research investigation that we were doing and and just to watch Fauci and other
[2:24:14.820 --> 2:24:20.380]  people lie and for mainstream media to not take them to task is unacceptable
[2:24:20.380 --> 2:24:25.740]  we have a product that's being force mandated into people so you know kudos
[2:24:25.740 --> 2:24:31.900]  to the fired personnel and the police officers that are going on strike in
[2:24:31.900 --> 2:24:36.020]  New York City and Los Angeles and other major cities around the country that is
[2:24:36.020 --> 2:24:42.140]  saying no and to everybody who's who's in those individuals to anybody out
[2:24:42.140 --> 2:24:46.260]  there attacking anybody who has any doubt and questions and are trying to do
[2:24:46.260 --> 2:24:50.780]  the right thing for themselves and their family and quite frankly for the
[2:24:50.780 --> 2:24:54.980]  viewers because the viewers are the ones being protected by our military and our
[2:24:54.980 --> 2:24:59.420]  fire and our police and our EMS and our paramedics it's you that they're
[2:24:59.420 --> 2:25:02.700]  protecting and so for them to say we're not going to be vaccinated with
[2:25:02.700 --> 2:25:07.020]  something that doesn't show a benefit and we have concerns about this this
[2:25:07.020 --> 2:25:12.940]  evidence looking under the microscope shows you what's going on at the time
[2:25:12.940 --> 2:25:19.060]  for games is over at the time for mandates is over you can't mandate
[2:25:19.060 --> 2:25:24.460]  there's there's no legitimate reason to mandate injecting people with products
[2:25:24.460 --> 2:25:28.420]  that are garbage or damaging well you're absolutely right dr. Fleming and just to
[2:25:28.420 --> 2:25:32.340]  expand on that we have Hillary Clinton and we have known Chomsky we have all
[2:25:32.340 --> 2:25:36.060]  these leaders saying lock people in their houses Kathleen civilians don't
[2:25:36.060 --> 2:25:41.660]  give them food no Chomsky if we don't take a Nuremberg violating experimental
[2:25:41.660 --> 2:25:45.260]  shot and then they're calling us evil people that are going to infect others
[2:25:45.260 --> 2:25:49.020]  when all the studies are out this destroys your immune system British
[2:25:49.020 --> 2:25:53.900]  studies are twice as likely to get COVID if you've had the shot double jabbed or
[2:25:53.900 --> 2:25:59.180]  quote getting diseases at record levels this quote super cold it's really ADE I
[2:25:59.180 --> 2:26:03.700]  mean this is wild they they clearly did this on purpose and are just trying to
[2:26:03.700 --> 2:26:07.580]  gaslight us but I don't see it working and so God bless the firefighters and
[2:26:07.580 --> 2:26:11.060]  nurses and police and others that are saying no to this because they get this
[2:26:11.060 --> 2:26:16.460]  through on all of us we're all done for yeah absolutely you know and and it's
[2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:21.260]  very clear that you know that these reports about HIV occurring in people
[2:26:21.260 --> 2:26:24.500]  you know you saw this in Australia New Zealand when they first looked at it and
[2:26:24.500 --> 2:26:29.580]  I warned originally up front that she's saying Lee was working on the same receptor
[2:26:29.580 --> 2:26:33.580]  and cells that I was in the 1990s they got the government all ticked off at me
[2:26:33.580 --> 2:26:41.020]  but that neuro5 AC receptor is what the HIV glycoprotein 120 hooks into the cell
[2:26:41.020 --> 2:26:45.340]  to begin the process of going to the ACE2 and by the way I saw you talking
[2:26:45.340 --> 2:26:50.980]  about that 15 16 months ago now that's mainstream news yeah it's amazing you
[2:26:50.980 --> 2:26:55.860]  know conspiracy becomes fact in what six months is what they tell me yes sir
[2:26:55.860 --> 2:27:00.620]  please continue yeah no I mean the reality of this is that these people have
[2:27:00.620 --> 2:27:03.780]  been playing this game and you can see him start to throw each other under the
[2:27:03.780 --> 2:27:07.500]  bus I mean it began with Redfield then Collins let everybody know he was
[2:27:07.500 --> 2:27:11.580]  resigning and then people at NIH turned around and said yeah we've been doing
[2:27:11.580 --> 2:27:15.300]  gain-of-function research the question is who are they gonna throw under the
[2:27:15.300 --> 2:27:19.420]  bus next now what they would like to do is to throw all of us under the bus but
[2:27:19.420 --> 2:27:23.580]  we didn't do this we're the ones that are simply looking at the science or the
[2:27:23.580 --> 2:27:28.260]  data and reporting it so that people are aware of it so people can make informed
[2:27:28.260 --> 2:27:33.420]  intelligent decisions you know informed consent that old concept that in
[2:27:33.420 --> 2:27:37.900]  Nuremberg we drove home with which is that you don't do research on people
[2:27:37.900 --> 2:27:41.500]  without them consenting to do that and these people decided that they were
[2:27:41.500 --> 2:27:45.220]  going to take and run the game and play the table and they were going to
[2:27:45.220 --> 2:27:49.380]  manipulate people and lock people down and they did a great job they isolated
[2:27:49.380 --> 2:27:53.500]  people from talking they kept people from thinking they attacked the people
[2:27:53.500 --> 2:27:57.460]  that were exposing what they were doing but they've been doing it for such a
[2:27:57.460 --> 2:28:02.020]  long time and enough intelligent people have coalesced together and right now
[2:28:02.020 --> 2:28:06.940]  kudos dr. Kevin W. McCarron because he was doing some of this over in Japan
[2:28:06.940 --> 2:28:12.860]  dr. Luke Montagnier who's been looking at this and in France and all the people
[2:28:12.860 --> 2:28:16.500]  in this country and around the world who have been independently trying to get to
[2:28:16.500 --> 2:28:22.340]  the facts of this and to yourself to everybody who's been involved in them
[2:28:22.340 --> 2:28:27.100]  in the alternative media I guess let's call the alternative media the mainstream
[2:28:27.100 --> 2:28:31.620]  media right now because the mainstream media just like the FDA health and human
[2:28:31.620 --> 2:28:37.140]  services and the CDC have either been bought or paid off in some form or
[2:28:37.140 --> 2:28:40.260]  incompetent that's right dr. Fleming stay there we're gonna be right back in a
[2:28:40.260 --> 2:28:44.540]  few minutes but absolutely I mean I'm having like an anxiety attack just
[2:28:44.540 --> 2:28:48.060]  thinking about this I mean this is so huge it's so confirmed the wheels are
[2:28:48.060 --> 2:28:51.980]  coming off there's this spectacle they're all being exposed the rats are
[2:28:51.980 --> 2:28:56.180]  leaving the sinking ship what comes next stay with us if you're concerned

[2:33:10.500 --> 2:33:17.780]  live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[2:33:17.780 --> 2:33:20.780]  you
[2:33:32.260 --> 2:33:37.460]  Dr. Richard Fleming is our guest right now and is negative as things have been
[2:33:37.460 --> 2:33:41.460]  as bad as the global lockdowns that triggered 25 plus million people to
[2:33:41.460 --> 2:33:45.140]  starve to death in the last 20 months according to the UN as bad as the
[2:33:45.140 --> 2:33:49.100]  millions of bad vaccine reactions and people getting sick and dying has been
[2:33:49.100 --> 2:33:57.580]  at least now the wheels are starting to come off and when I just coldly look at
[2:33:57.580 --> 2:34:02.540]  what's happening to Fauci and Peter Dazik and Bill Gates and the NIH and the
[2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:07.460]  documents that people released that they had on them thousands of pages where
[2:34:07.460 --> 2:34:11.100]  they were at the lab saying you want gain a function because they know it was
[2:34:11.100 --> 2:34:14.500]  illegal and Fauci uses the word gain a function in the emails we've shown them
[2:34:14.500 --> 2:34:18.740]  to you and he says I want you to combine these four viruses and he lists the four
[2:34:18.740 --> 2:34:23.620]  that made covid with the HIV delivery system and he mentions the protein and
[2:34:23.620 --> 2:34:29.380]  how to grow it and then he there's emails of him saying in what in December of
[2:34:29.380 --> 2:34:35.060]  2019 before this is even in the news that covid's out there to prepare the
[2:34:35.060 --> 2:34:39.340]  vaccines for the new viruses they've made then we have video Peter Dazik in
[2:34:39.340 --> 2:34:44.100]  videos in the same December covering bases saying oh yeah we're merging
[2:34:44.100 --> 2:34:50.060]  viruses to make a super virus to make a super vaccine so this is just so crazy
[2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:54.460]  to have this out in the open and there's dr. Richard Fleming and he lists all
[2:34:54.460 --> 2:34:58.980]  this and it's in the video in the report on band-aid video goes out and works
[2:34:58.980 --> 2:35:03.820]  with other scientists that are respected to in a lab with them all watching
[2:35:03.820 --> 2:35:09.980]  getting the Pfizer mRNA concoction it's on a vaccine and injecting it and within
[2:35:09.980 --> 2:35:14.220]  one minute it goes from oxygenated to brown and then he tries to do it with
[2:35:14.220 --> 2:35:18.740]  other substances and it doesn't happen anybody knows blood and it's hard to get
[2:35:18.740 --> 2:35:21.820]  it when it's out in the oxygen to change even trying to clean blood up with
[2:35:21.820 --> 2:35:25.780]  cleaning solvent off the carpet and it doesn't turn to another color you're
[2:35:25.780 --> 2:35:30.460]  putting a solvent on it so so this is just crazy anybody that knows about
[2:35:30.460 --> 2:35:34.540]  blood stains is you can put them in the washing machine and put blades in it
[2:35:34.540 --> 2:35:38.620]  barely gets rid of it I mean but this is instantly turning blood another color
[2:35:38.620 --> 2:35:43.580]  this is heavy heavy heavy so what were you thinking just as a layperson not
[2:35:43.580 --> 2:35:47.500]  this is a doctor dr. Fleming when when you're mixing the blood with the with
[2:35:47.500 --> 2:35:51.900]  the shot with the with the Pfizer concoction with the with the Pfizer
[2:35:51.900 --> 2:35:57.020]  frankin essence frankin juice and you just see it start turning brown and the
[2:35:57.020 --> 2:36:02.460]  oxygen leaving the cells what were you thinking when you saw that that the red
[2:36:02.460 --> 2:36:06.860]  blood cells are being damaged because you've never seen blood that's not red
[2:36:06.860 --> 2:36:12.020]  outside the body and the reason for that is that when the blood gets exposed to
[2:36:12.020 --> 2:36:16.940]  the air with oxygen blood automatically turns red even when it it's bluer
[2:36:16.940 --> 2:36:21.180]  inside the body so when you draw it in a vein some of the oxygen has been used up
[2:36:21.180 --> 2:36:25.180]  that's why the veins have that bluish color and immediately when the blood
[2:36:25.180 --> 2:36:31.180]  hits the air it's oxygenated so this was oxygenated blood constantly exposed to
[2:36:31.180 --> 2:36:38.500]  oxygen that no longer could hold on to its oxygen and this is this is you know I
[2:36:38.500 --> 2:36:42.180]  know I keep using the legal term unconscionable because it simply means
[2:36:42.180 --> 2:36:47.780]  you can't justify this under any set of circumstances and these vaccines now not
[2:36:47.780 --> 2:36:51.300]  only do we know that everything that we've been talking about with this
[2:36:51.300 --> 2:36:57.100]  inflammatory robotic response since 1994 is valid not only does it verify you
[2:36:57.100 --> 2:37:00.500]  know our measurements that we do with Fleming method to actually find
[2:37:00.500 --> 2:37:05.060]  treatments but it also brings up a new liability issue for these vaccines
[2:37:05.060 --> 2:37:10.340]  because with the vaccines have been prevented because of vaccine laws this
[2:37:10.340 --> 2:37:15.820]  is a product liability suit this is strict liability where a product that's
[2:37:15.820 --> 2:37:21.100]  made and injected into someone doesn't meet the standards of what the industry
[2:37:21.100 --> 2:37:26.420]  has with all this garbage in it this opens up a brand-new series of lawsuits
[2:37:26.420 --> 2:37:30.820]  for attorneys all across the United States to go after Pfizer, Moderna and
[2:37:30.820 --> 2:37:36.340]  Janssen for strict liability products that they're no longer protected under
[2:37:36.340 --> 2:37:40.820]  this vaccine lawsuit and and I want to mention you know that going after these
[2:37:40.820 --> 2:37:45.020]  people shouldn't just be an international criminal court which we can
[2:37:45.020 --> 2:37:49.380]  thank the attorneys in the UK, McCallum and Maine you know we can thank the
[2:37:49.380 --> 2:37:53.660]  Slovakia attorneys Weiss and Pyrza Kova and Schmidt and the French
[2:37:53.660 --> 2:37:57.580]  attorneys Atelier and Cohen and the Czech Republic attorneys Nielsen I mean
[2:37:57.580 --> 2:38:02.140]  these people went out of their way to to put pressure on the ICC which we are
[2:38:02.140 --> 2:38:07.460]  putting on them along along with the Nazi concentration camp
[2:38:07.460 --> 2:38:11.500]  survivors Brown Handler and Sharab they have all stepped forward like you are
[2:38:11.500 --> 2:38:18.060]  like we you know like McCarran and Montagnier and myself are and lots of
[2:38:18.060 --> 2:38:21.660]  people around the world to put these people back in the place that they
[2:38:21.660 --> 2:38:25.660]  belong the Japanese caught on to this you know you're showing the heading
[2:38:25.660 --> 2:38:28.660]  there they're they're seeing garbage in the vaccine well that's where I was
[2:38:28.660 --> 2:38:32.300]  going next and I had my my couple and I was telling them and said it off hey
[2:38:32.300 --> 2:38:36.660]  pull up Japan but they were doing it exactly backing up what you found under
[2:38:36.660 --> 2:38:39.780]  an electron microscope or under a microscope what you found so that's
[2:38:39.780 --> 2:38:43.180]  even secondary that under the law the regulations that you have on your site
[2:38:43.180 --> 2:38:47.020]  you explain they're supposed to pull it with the level of particular that you
[2:38:47.020 --> 2:38:51.220]  found that it's that's a whole nother issue of the same black metal and same
[2:38:51.220 --> 2:38:56.060]  black garbage that they found in Moderna and Pfizer shots in Japan so Japan is
[2:38:56.060 --> 2:38:59.060]  getting the same shots we're getting they're just doing their job and actually
[2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:02.700]  looking at it when people die to find out what's happening do we have any idea
[2:39:02.700 --> 2:39:08.940]  what's in there the Japanese said it was a metal yeah well you know there's
[2:39:08.940 --> 2:39:16.340]  really we saw crystals we saw fiber particles you know it's a matter of
[2:39:16.340 --> 2:39:20.460]  just how deeply you look at it as to what you're probably gonna find but the
[2:39:20.460 --> 2:39:24.180]  reality is none of that garbage should have been in there so it doesn't matter
[2:39:24.180 --> 2:39:28.560]  you know which junk is in there whether it's a manufacturing problem or a
[2:39:28.560 --> 2:39:32.500]  laziness problem or intentionally or or accidentally put in there it's still in
[2:39:32.500 --> 2:39:36.380]  there and they're supposed to be checking these products and this violates
[2:39:36.380 --> 2:39:40.300]  every rule of putting a product out there this is being injected into human
[2:39:40.300 --> 2:39:42.780]  beings and let's stop there again doctor as you said a year and a half ago
[2:39:42.780 --> 2:39:47.020]  though that's why they skip the regular approval process and then lied a few
[2:39:47.020 --> 2:39:53.580]  months ago and said it's approved yeah in 2026 explain that to people well you
[2:39:53.580 --> 2:40:00.380]  know that they there's evidence that looks like they kind of approved all
[2:40:00.380 --> 2:40:06.100]  this stuff upfront long before any of this was known to anybody and Fauci knew
[2:40:06.100 --> 2:40:11.420]  back in 2007 that if he was gonna develop a virus and release it that the
[2:40:11.420 --> 2:40:15.980]  only way to prevent that virus from being spread would based upon the 2007
[2:40:15.980 --> 2:40:20.460]  National Science Foundation report was to shut down international travel they
[2:40:20.460 --> 2:40:24.700]  did not want to shut down the spread of this virus they wanted a virus that
[2:40:24.700 --> 2:40:29.260]  would be spread around they wanted an opportunity to use these vaccines they
[2:40:29.260 --> 2:40:33.580]  wanted an opportunity to control doctors and prevent doctors from using in fact
[2:40:33.580 --> 2:40:38.300]  remember Trump said shut down the flights early and they all said no yeah
[2:40:38.300 --> 2:40:42.820]  that's exactly right we have a politician who does just his gut instinct
[2:40:42.820 --> 2:40:47.460]  where the head of the infectious disease for the United States NIAID should
[2:40:47.460 --> 2:40:51.180]  have been a work look the one of three things happened I did the Fauci was not
[2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:55.700]  aware of a study in his area that was paid for by the government in 2007
[2:40:55.700 --> 2:40:59.780]  which doesn't bode well he he was aware of it but didn't bother to read it which
[2:40:59.780 --> 2:41:03.340]  doesn't bode well or he was aware of it read it and didn't understand it which
[2:41:03.340 --> 2:41:06.700]  doesn't bode well it doesn't matter to me which one of the three you want to take
[2:41:06.700 --> 2:41:12.620]  he didn't do his job and and he and he actually stood there and and disagreed
[2:41:12.620 --> 2:41:17.140]  with the president United States which he's done a number so doctor let me ask
[2:41:17.140 --> 2:41:20.140]  you this now that it's coming out the data function now it's coming out this
[2:41:20.140 --> 2:41:26.180]  shot is deadly where does all this go next yeah well the obvious reality is
[2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:31.340]  you know what I'm calling for on the last slide is for a the drug vaccines to
[2:41:31.340 --> 2:41:37.620]  stop immediately until the FDA and and every other and health and human services
[2:41:37.620 --> 2:41:42.820]  and anybody else involved can one explain the desaturation effect of these
[2:41:42.820 --> 2:41:48.700]  vaccines on the blood to explain the clotting factors that's occurring on
[2:41:48.700 --> 2:41:52.660]  these blood and it those have to be corrected before you could even
[2:41:52.660 --> 2:41:56.820]  consider them and number three explain the garbage contaminant and the strict
[2:41:56.820 --> 2:42:00.660]  liability problems that are going on here and as I said in that last slide
[2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:05.580]  don't take my word for it anybody out there who's able to carry out this
[2:42:05.580 --> 2:42:11.020]  research should be carrying it out Mike Adams and I spoke yesterday he and I
[2:42:11.020 --> 2:42:18.100]  are gonna work on carrying out further studies in his lab in Austin anybody
[2:42:18.100 --> 2:42:21.700]  involved with this around the world who's a serious scientist who wants the
[2:42:21.700 --> 2:42:27.660]  question get a hold of these vaccines get a hold of blood do it properly let's
[2:42:27.660 --> 2:42:30.820]  start flooding the world with the information that people need to see
[2:42:30.820 --> 2:42:35.540]  because these vaccines effective immediately should no longer be injected
[2:42:35.540 --> 2:42:41.140]  into a human being until all of this can be resolved and and anybody who who
[2:42:41.140 --> 2:42:45.460]  continues to inject this is committing crimes against humanity and or to
[2:42:45.460 --> 2:42:50.660]  experimenting on people and this is Nuremberg you're right this is this is
[2:42:50.660 --> 2:42:55.940]  Dr. Mingela part two we'll be right back this is history folks why do my
[2:42:55.940 --> 2:43:01.820]  enemies hate me so much Alex Jones here on the morning of Friday October 22nd

[2:44:24.140 --> 2:44:28.620]  I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let me tell you when I don't take it
[2:44:28.620 --> 2:44:34.580]  I pay a price I really do I take that B12 and I am electric man I can run 10
[2:44:34.580 --> 2:44:39.700]  miles I did some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends will
[2:44:39.700 --> 2:44:44.900]  attest to the fact that yeah for a guy in his sixties you know pushing 70 I'm
[2:44:44.900 --> 2:44:50.820]  and I know I'm not just blowing smoke here the B12 saves my life
[2:44:56.660 --> 2:45:01.180]  by now you've heard me talk about the Bio Pros and how they're creating amazing

[2:45:57.980 --> 2:46:02.460]  I want to explain something that is absolutely seed understanding our world
[2:46:02.460 --> 2:46:06.860]  it's very very simple but the most of all don't know the privately owned central
[2:46:06.860 --> 2:46:12.500]  banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of
[2:46:12.500 --> 2:46:17.940]  dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure
[2:46:17.940 --> 2:46:23.940]  intellectual property energy they're using it to buy people to buy influence
[2:46:23.940 --> 2:46:29.140]  and in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage
[2:46:29.140 --> 2:46:33.100]  that manipulate markets but they never allowed that money to get into the general
[2:46:33.100 --> 2:46:36.780]  circulation or it would cause massive inflation now they've gone ahead and
[2:46:36.780 --> 2:46:41.020]  weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy buying up
[2:46:41.020 --> 2:46:45.740]  everything not to have the companies operate but to actually shut them down
[2:46:45.740 --> 2:46:50.580]  and force the collapse of civilization making the companies they do find the
[2:46:50.580 --> 2:46:53.980]  only things left standing the great reset this is what's happening now
[2:46:53.980 --> 2:47:04.660]  everyone is the only way to stop it you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:11.260 --> 2:47:15.260]  all right you're tuned in to the last segment of the third hour we're gonna go
[2:47:15.260 --> 2:47:18.460]  a little bit into the fourth hour with dr. Richard Fleming Paul Watson's taking
[2:47:18.460 --> 2:47:23.300]  over and I just really want to ask dr. Fleming to please come back on very
[2:47:23.300 --> 2:47:26.740]  soon and to please get on all our other shows and to please have all the listeners
[2:47:26.740 --> 2:47:31.180]  go to freeworldnews.tv that's the url where our videos aren't getting censored
[2:47:31.180 --> 2:47:36.180]  right now it's just a mirror of band-aid video and get the emergency report he
[2:47:36.180 --> 2:47:41.060]  filed last night with us that we then got edited and boiled down it's medical
[2:47:41.060 --> 2:47:46.220]  bombshell Pfizer vax attacks human blood creating plots under microscope that's a
[2:47:46.220 --> 2:47:50.100]  very simple but very accurate headline but it's worse than that it's also full
[2:47:50.100 --> 2:47:55.500]  of contaminants but I mean this is a godsend though in that the enemy that
[2:47:55.500 --> 2:48:00.620]  did this who premeditatedly carried it all out doctor Fleming said at every
[2:48:00.620 --> 2:48:04.020]  level that lied about it that suppressed treatments they're doing this for a
[2:48:04.020 --> 2:48:07.620]  power grab and a world ID and a world social credit score they admit now they
[2:48:07.620 --> 2:48:12.300]  both said that two weeks ago and so but but they overreached and it's going to
[2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:16.380]  be so obvious as dr. Fleming just said when other scientists then duplicate
[2:48:16.380 --> 2:48:21.660]  this and see this and when other labs do this they're not gonna be able to
[2:48:21.660 --> 2:48:25.340]  suppress this information people are gonna see what it does with blood and
[2:48:25.340 --> 2:48:28.140]  they're gonna see the other tests you did with other things does nothing to
[2:48:28.140 --> 2:48:31.860]  blood and this didn't we have all the other studies and all the admissions
[2:48:31.860 --> 2:48:36.780]  dr. Fleming so all I can say is thank god you did this why are you the first
[2:48:36.780 --> 2:48:40.140]  really accredited person to do it because when I saw people saying there's
[2:48:40.140 --> 2:48:44.540]  hidden aliens and five-legged goblins in there I said that's obviously
[2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:48.940]  disinfoed it is credit us just like you just said of course I could do that and
[2:48:48.940 --> 2:48:52.540]  have 20 million views they wouldn't censor me if I put that out also notice
[2:48:52.540 --> 2:48:56.380]  Twitter and Facebook don't censor that but they do try to censor you and other
[2:48:56.380 --> 2:49:01.100]  real scientists so this is coffin nails to their COVID narrative if it gets out
[2:49:01.100 --> 2:49:06.380]  correct sir oh absolutely and and remember we talked about this before the
[2:49:06.380 --> 2:49:10.300]  first people that Hitler put in concentration camps for the PhDs and
[2:49:10.300 --> 2:49:15.460]  the MDs take us out of the play so that the only narrative that people have to
[2:49:15.460 --> 2:49:19.300]  listen to is what the government wants you to believe and you've taken all the
[2:49:19.300 --> 2:49:25.340]  all the credibility out you know and science frequently restores itself by
[2:49:25.340 --> 2:49:30.820]  by doing the right thing you know when Fauci said he's science that you can't
[2:49:30.820 --> 2:49:35.060]  imagine how I cringe on the inside with that because somebody who's done 53 years
[2:49:35.060 --> 2:49:40.420]  worth of research what I want to do is just scream no you are not and so when
[2:49:40.420 --> 2:49:44.500]  I'm asking other scientists to go out there and do this I'm not only saying
[2:49:44.500 --> 2:49:50.020]  verify what we've seen I'm saying let's get out here and start to make science
[2:49:50.020 --> 2:49:55.740]  great again and restore our credibility that has been lost from what's been
[2:49:55.740 --> 2:49:59.740]  going on by by this gain of function research and this manipulation and
[2:49:59.740 --> 2:50:04.980]  cover-up we have an obligation to go out there and say wait a minute science is
[2:50:04.980 --> 2:50:09.780]  real science is not full of bad people there are some bad people in science
[2:50:09.780 --> 2:50:14.540]  because we sample from the human population but we are accountable to
[2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:19.900]  ourselves it's not the non-scientists that are going to correct the scientific
[2:50:19.900 --> 2:50:23.460]  community it's not the non-physicians that are going to help with the medical
[2:50:23.460 --> 2:50:29.820]  community you know physicians and scientists have been you know taking on
[2:50:29.820 --> 2:50:35.020]  the chin for forever is summarize got lost his medical license and credibility
[2:50:35.020 --> 2:50:39.700]  for saying to wash it wash hands in between babies and and shortly after he
[2:50:39.700 --> 2:50:43.580]  died and they started doing that infant mortality in hospitals dropped by 50
[2:50:43.580 --> 2:50:48.820]  percent so well I mean it was it was Copernicus and people and Galileo that
[2:50:48.820 --> 2:50:54.180]  got locked up in in jail for the rest of their lives for saying that the earth is
[2:50:54.180 --> 2:50:58.620]  not the center of the universe and that the planets orbit the Sun right that's
[2:50:58.620 --> 2:51:02.460]  exactly what happened to Galileo you got put under house arrest not for saying
[2:51:02.460 --> 2:51:07.900]  that the earth went around the Sun but for saying look don't take my word for
[2:51:07.900 --> 2:51:12.860]  it don't take the official he said they move they move it was all points and they
[2:51:12.860 --> 2:51:17.980]  moved yeah he said you can look at the Sun you can look at the moon you can look
[2:51:17.980 --> 2:51:23.060]  at the stars and you can figure it out for yourself well that's the video of
[2:51:23.060 --> 2:51:29.020]  this blood is so powerful because you can see what happens in that short period
[2:51:29.020 --> 2:51:33.740]  of time you can see the blood cells move you can see the blood cells clot it's
[2:51:33.740 --> 2:51:38.300]  not me taking a static picture and then showing it to you you get to see it and
[2:51:38.300 --> 2:51:42.620]  you get to see us move around the microscope so it's you're there to
[2:51:42.620 --> 2:51:48.020]  actually see it your everybody is intelligent enough to do this and while
[2:51:48.020 --> 2:51:53.100]  I'm mentioning a because I believe in in in crediting people you've got an
[2:51:53.100 --> 2:51:58.580]  outstanding staff that they worked very very hard on this and B I lived in
[2:51:58.580 --> 2:52:02.660]  Los Angeles California for seven years and I tried to work on this out there
[2:52:02.660 --> 2:52:08.180]  and got nowhere I moved back to Texas where I trained as a cardiologist and
[2:52:08.180 --> 2:52:12.580]  moved to Dallas and the people here have embraced what we've been doing have
[2:52:12.580 --> 2:52:16.660]  been very supportive the people down in Austin yourself and and several other
[2:52:16.660 --> 2:52:22.100]  individuals have been very supportive coming to Texas is an area where people
[2:52:22.100 --> 2:52:27.740]  actually embrace exposing the truth so that people know what's going on and
[2:52:27.740 --> 2:52:31.980]  can make intelligent decisions on their own they're not dumb they're not stupid
[2:52:31.980 --> 2:52:36.260]  they can handle the truth they're not going to get a PhD or an MD or JD by
[2:52:36.260 --> 2:52:40.740]  listening but they can see what's going on and they have the intelligence and the
[2:52:40.740 --> 2:52:47.460]  common sense I was about to say I don't I don't have a degree as a coroner but if
[2:52:47.460 --> 2:52:50.860]  I see somebody shoot somebody with a 12 gauge shotgun and they flop over and die
[2:52:50.860 --> 2:52:54.860]  I can reach down and say there's no pulse they're dead I know that that bullets
[2:52:54.860 --> 2:52:58.540]  out of that shotgun projectiles killed them and I can watch statistically with
[2:52:58.540 --> 2:53:02.140]  people I know that take the vaccines get really sick and die and I can go look at
[2:53:02.140 --> 2:53:05.700]  the bear zone numbers and see it's happening so I can see what Galileo
[2:53:05.700 --> 2:53:11.940]  saw it moves people are moving they're dying we're seeing an effect absolutely
[2:53:11.940 --> 2:53:15.940]  and you can watch now as these bottom feeders are throwing each other under
[2:53:15.940 --> 2:53:19.900]  the bus so that they can aren't the ones that are going to pay the the ultimate
[2:53:19.900 --> 2:53:24.740]  penalty what I want right now I want Americans to stand up recognize what's
[2:53:24.740 --> 2:53:29.380]  going on stop being vaccinated don't attack people that have been vaccinated
[2:53:29.380 --> 2:53:32.060]  recognize they thought they were doing the right thing but support these
[2:53:32.060 --> 2:53:36.060]  individuals I want you to get a hold of your attorneys and have them start
[2:53:36.060 --> 2:53:40.340]  looking at strict liability lawsuits on these vaccines because the vaccines
[2:53:40.340 --> 2:53:44.620]  aren't protected under that and I want the Congress of the United States to
[2:53:44.620 --> 2:53:50.060]  indict to investigate and indict Anthony Fauci and and Collins and the rest of
[2:53:50.060 --> 2:53:54.860]  these people that were involved in this gain of function research and lied under
[2:53:54.860 --> 2:53:59.420]  oath to Congress and I want the president United States to grow up and quit
[2:53:59.420 --> 2:54:04.420]  mandating things that are beyond his legal authority to do you can't mandate
[2:54:04.420 --> 2:54:09.500]  injecting people with something that has garbage in it that takes this oxygen out
[2:54:09.500 --> 2:54:14.420]  of the blood that causes the blood to coagulate to clot and and and get by
[2:54:14.420 --> 2:54:18.340]  with it this is illegal it's unconstitutional it's unethical it's
[2:54:18.340 --> 2:54:23.500]  unscientific it's unmedical well sir your first and foremost a cardiologist
[2:54:23.500 --> 2:54:28.300]  and you again almost over a year and a half ago predicted all this now it's all
[2:54:28.300 --> 2:54:31.140]  happened and there's tens of thousands of other prominent scientists and doctors
[2:54:31.140 --> 2:54:34.780]  saying the same thing now they put advisories on these shots so they know
[2:54:34.780 --> 2:54:38.380]  this and as you said earlier they clearly premeditatedly did this how the
[2:54:38.380 --> 2:54:42.420]  hell did they ever think they get away with it a then be as the rats leave the
[2:54:42.420 --> 2:54:46.140]  sinking ship what do you think they're gonna try to pull to try to get out of
[2:54:46.140 --> 2:54:49.460]  this because I mean I don't see them getting away with this right now if we
[2:54:49.460 --> 2:54:55.060]  keep pushing yeah I mean that's the reality everybody needs to keep pushing
[2:54:55.060 --> 2:54:59.580]  on this and to not give any any any leeway here their their attitude that you
[2:54:59.580 --> 2:55:03.340]  know if we can just get you to think about something else the old squirrel
[2:55:03.340 --> 2:55:07.020]  phenomenon you know a distraction here a distraction there which is what they've
[2:55:07.020 --> 2:55:13.300]  been doing you know if we stay on target and don't back down these people are
[2:55:13.300 --> 2:55:17.380]  going to have to be held accountable you know this is not a matter of allowing
[2:55:17.380 --> 2:55:22.900]  them to just leave office or to go without a retirement pay these people
[2:55:22.900 --> 2:55:27.660]  committed crimes against humanity they experimented on human beings they did it
[2:55:27.660 --> 2:55:32.140]  on a much more massive scale than Mengele and the Nazis did in in Germany
[2:55:32.140 --> 2:55:35.700]  because they just did it on the people that were in their concentration camps
[2:55:35.700 --> 2:55:41.380]  these folks did it around the world and they prevented the shutdown of traffic
[2:55:41.380 --> 2:55:45.700]  that could have isolated the virus they knew that they were working on this
[2:55:45.700 --> 2:55:51.260]  they put a level four lab the Wuhan Institute virology lab right smack dab
[2:55:51.260 --> 2:55:55.940]  in the middle of where people are and then they were dumb enough to actually
[2:55:55.940 --> 2:56:02.300]  send me two emails this year to ask me if because of my physics being a
[2:56:02.300 --> 2:56:06.940]  physicist if I would be interested in considering a job at Fort Dietrich for
[2:56:06.940 --> 2:56:13.460]  the investigation of viruses of corona viruses funded by NIAID I mean their
[2:56:13.460 --> 2:56:19.260]  brazenness just knows no limits but I think the American public have had
[2:56:19.260 --> 2:56:24.260]  enough the people in the world have had enough you can't look at all this
[2:56:24.260 --> 2:56:28.420]  information coming from other directions and say this isn't real this
[2:56:28.420 --> 2:56:34.540]  phenomenon is real it's of it affects the blood within a minute or two and it's
[2:56:34.540 --> 2:56:39.140]  just a matter of everybody's individual characteristics as to how badly they're
[2:56:39.140 --> 2:56:44.220]  going to be affected and let's not mince any words this isn't over if we stop
[2:56:44.220 --> 2:56:50.060]  vaccinating today the long-term sequelae of what's happening from these vaccines
[2:56:50.060 --> 2:56:54.540]  that are making spike proteins that we know get into the brain not only causes
[2:56:54.540 --> 2:56:58.740]  inflammation and blood clotting this inflammatory robotic response but have
[2:56:58.740 --> 2:57:03.500]  been shown to cause fry on disease and animals we are a long way from being over
[2:57:03.500 --> 2:57:07.860]  on this and the harm and the damage they don't get to buy their way out of this
[2:57:07.860 --> 2:57:12.660]  we're talking about criminal charges on people that have been doing this for
[2:57:12.660 --> 2:57:17.900]  decades and thought nothing about doing this to other human beings that's right
[2:57:17.900 --> 2:57:21.740]  they got away with so many things Fauci testing on young black children with
[2:57:21.740 --> 2:57:25.180]  the experimental stuff that killed them and and just it's experimenting on the
[2:57:25.180 --> 2:57:29.140]  dogs and everything it's a repeat of that your full report is it banned on
[2:57:29.140 --> 2:57:33.060]  video medical bombshell Pfizer backs attacks human blood creating clots
[2:57:33.060 --> 2:57:37.100]  under microscope it's up to you listeners to get that out and circumvent it
[2:57:37.100 --> 2:57:42.380]  circumvent the censorship circumvent the censors it's up to you will be
[2:57:42.380 --> 2:57:48.460]  right back stay with us my now you've heard me I am taping this update on the
[2:57:48.460 --> 2:57:54.260]  morning of Friday October 22nd 2021 listeners who've already tried and
[2:57:54.260 --> 2:57:59.420]  really seen the powerful effects of rainforest ultra should be excited to
[2:57:59.420 --> 2:58:03.580]  know that we've got a limited supply of it in stock but it'll be sold out at
[2:58:03.580 --> 2:58:08.140]  current sales rates by Monday morning despite that fact we're still offering a
[2:58:08.140 --> 2:58:13.300]  major discount of 25% off it is an amazing new tropic I went to one of the
[2:58:13.300 --> 2:58:17.620]  top labs the country and I said I want very powerful quick acting extremely
[2:58:17.620 --> 2:58:21.660]  clean new tropic that wears off quick because I want to be able to take it
[2:58:21.660 --> 2:58:25.540]  if I've got to work till 10 at night take it at seven and for it to wear off by
[2:58:25.540 --> 2:58:30.780]  10 and that's exactly what they did with brain force ultra now we have other
[2:58:30.780 --> 2:58:33.500]  great products like turbo force that last for 10 hours it's a different
[2:58:33.500 --> 2:58:36.740]  formula it's over the top powerful so strong I can't even take it by the way
[2:58:36.740 --> 2:58:40.660]  it's sold out right now the brain force ultra is really something special it's
[2:58:40.660 --> 2:58:46.260]  25% off limited supply we'll sell out early next week info or store.com the
[2:58:46.260 --> 2:58:50.300]  average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that
[2:58:50.300 --> 2:58:55.140]  there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the
[2:58:55.140 --> 2:58:59.060]  globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post human
[2:58:59.060 --> 2:59:02.860]  world for the United States of Brazil and of course triggered by the bricks in
[2:59:02.860 --> 2:59:07.020]  the UK nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world
[2:59:07.020 --> 2:59:11.140]  government that's why they launched their great resets and their program after
[2:59:11.140 --> 2:59:17.140]  collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top-down
[2:59:17.140 --> 2:59:21.980]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our
[2:59:21.980 --> 2:59:26.420]  guns because we wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this
[2:59:26.420 --> 2:59:32.020]  world government system could win they released a biological weapon on us now
[2:59:32.020 --> 2:59:36.820]  we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago it's that simple
[2:59:36.820 --> 2:59:40.460]  they can't finish because of our free speech in our guns so the global
[2:59:40.460 --> 2:59:44.580]  corporate combine released over 19 and you know the rest of history expose this
[2:59:44.580 --> 2:59:51.820]  paradigm and we win leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[2:59:51.820 --> 3:00:06.260]  order it's Alex Jones Twitter Facebook Instagram TikTok they're just full of
[3:00:06.260 --> 3:00:10.540]  young women like this one who's in the hospital has blood clots after her job
[3:00:10.540 --> 3:00:14.820]  made her take the shot 19 years old and there are just thousands of these but
[3:00:14.820 --> 3:00:18.220]  what happens is they get taken down like the young man that was on the golf team
[3:00:18.220 --> 3:00:21.900]  in great shape had the heart attack we said yeah you're right your doctors did
[3:00:21.900 --> 3:00:25.100]  say it caused a heart attack but you're scaring people we're gonna remove you
[3:00:25.100 --> 3:00:28.780]  from Instagram with your five million viewers they actually said that in Yahoo
[3:00:28.780 --> 3:00:33.340]  News the UN this UN looked at what he did and the UN's in charge and now the UN
[3:00:33.340 --> 3:00:37.100]  is telling Texas we can't produce as well when did when who died made the UN
[3:00:37.100 --> 3:00:41.140]  boss this is global corporate government alright Dr. Richard Fleming this
[3:00:41.140 --> 3:00:45.820]  is the most important discovery so far proving what's happening here and that's
[3:00:45.820 --> 3:00:48.420]  why they of course skip the testing because they knew exactly what they
[3:00:48.420 --> 3:00:51.620]  were doing obviously I thought they'd get away with it they're obviously not
[3:00:51.620 --> 3:00:55.780]  in the few minutes we have left what else would you like to add or what book
[3:00:55.780 --> 3:01:00.780]  him would you like to put on this historic interview well I just think
[3:01:00.780 --> 3:01:04.940]  it's very important for people to realize that even though they're
[3:01:04.940 --> 3:01:08.980]  probably listening to this information and feeling overwhelmed that it's this
[3:01:08.980 --> 3:01:15.020]  knowledge that takes back control of our lives not having that knowledge doesn't
[3:01:15.020 --> 3:01:19.180]  take it away from us you know that information was there we simply found
[3:01:19.180 --> 3:01:23.340]  it and now make it available for you and I hear from the people every day well
[3:01:23.340 --> 3:01:27.740]  how do I explain to somebody who tells me that I need to take the vaccine that
[3:01:27.740 --> 3:01:32.220]  I'm wrong for for not being vaccinated that I'm posing a threat to people you
[3:01:32.220 --> 3:01:35.980]  know above and beyond all the things that we've done before which is to show
[3:01:35.980 --> 3:01:41.740]  that the vaccines don't statistically reduce COVID or or or deaths apart from
[3:01:41.740 --> 3:01:45.340]  the fact that you know we've shown that vaccines don't prevent you from getting
[3:01:45.340 --> 3:01:49.580]  infected or transmitting infections apart from the fact that you know after 22
[3:01:49.580 --> 3:01:53.340]  months if you haven't figured out that probably everybody's been exposed to the
[3:01:53.340 --> 3:01:57.820]  virus from person to person and it's the vaccines that are ramping up the the
[3:01:57.820 --> 3:02:02.660]  problem by exposing billions of spike proteins into people and now seeing what
[3:02:02.660 --> 3:02:07.180]  it really does when it gets injected into your body which raises a level so
[3:02:07.180 --> 3:02:12.500]  much more about the importance of not having people get vaccinated and
[3:02:12.500 --> 3:02:17.580]  wondering about concerns with shedding you know we have been flipped upside
[3:02:17.580 --> 3:02:22.620]  down doing everything backwards isolating healthy people quarantining
[3:02:22.620 --> 3:02:27.700]  healthy people not giving medications to people when they need it allowing the
[3:02:27.700 --> 3:02:31.660]  virus to spread from country to country when we could have shut it down
[3:02:31.660 --> 3:02:35.860]  manipulating a system so that we rushed out vaccines that were already in the
[3:02:35.860 --> 3:02:39.300]  pipelines being being worked on that they knew that they were going to do that
[3:02:39.300 --> 3:02:42.980]  you you referred to earlier where they where they'd gone through this where
[3:02:42.980 --> 3:02:46.500]  they went through event 201 the same type of thing that I was trained in as a
[3:02:46.500 --> 3:02:51.180]  Kennedy kid that that started my education so early in life which is to
[3:02:51.180 --> 3:02:55.140]  run the scenarios of determining who lives and who dies when not everybody
[3:02:55.140 --> 3:02:59.300]  can live and who's valuable and who's non valuable this is nothing more than
[3:02:59.300 --> 3:03:04.860]  bringing you the information for you to see the the blood actually changed the
[3:03:04.860 --> 3:03:09.380]  blood lose its color the blood clot the garbage under the microscope with the
[3:03:09.380 --> 3:03:14.340]  vaccine so that you can look at other people with confidence say here's the
[3:03:14.340 --> 3:03:18.740]  images of the results and then to look at the rest of the scientific community
[3:03:18.740 --> 3:03:23.820]  and say we have been basically rolled over by a steamroller in science while
[3:03:23.820 --> 3:03:28.660]  this guy in Washington DC Fauci and the others claim that there are science and
[3:03:28.660 --> 3:03:33.060]  and and lose credibility to the general public that the scientific journals have
[3:03:33.060 --> 3:03:36.980]  lost credibility by publishing garbage from Dayzak and and the rest that's why
[3:03:36.980 --> 3:03:40.940]  I resigned from Lancet and so you're right the real scientific community must
[3:03:40.940 --> 3:03:45.300]  stand up and and saves humanity again and everybody's got to spread your word
[3:03:45.300 --> 3:03:49.540]  in your video at freeworldnews.tv thank you so much Dr. Fleming please join us
[3:03:49.540 --> 3:03:55.540]  again very soon with updates God bless my pleasure thank you well folks that's a

[3:04:44.020 --> 3:04:49.700]  Joseph Watson from London England loaded for bear takes over in T minus 60
[3:04:49.700 --> 3:04:58.620]  seconds and then Owen shroyer and the war room 3 p.m. Central I am taping I have
[3:04:58.620 --> 3:05:02.860]  the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart deep in my soul I've ever had in
[3:05:02.860 --> 3:05:09.340]  my 47 years on this planet I've had a lot of lost everybody else has and it's
[3:05:09.340 --> 3:05:18.660]  because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and
[3:05:18.660 --> 3:05:26.140]  bled and sweat for and now we're just throwing it all away and I see that
[3:05:26.140 --> 3:05:30.260]  general public DNA medically induced scientifically induced behavioral
[3:05:30.260 --> 3:05:36.780]  psychologically controlled tranche and I know we're being fed into this global
[3:05:36.780 --> 3:05:42.740]  speaker under and it's so incredibly sad but this is the process of birth and
[3:05:42.740 --> 3:05:46.980]  then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and
[3:05:46.980 --> 3:05:51.860]  then coming back to life again it's just the globalist are actively trying to
[3:05:51.860 --> 3:05:56.380]  steer control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the species
[3:05:56.380 --> 3:06:23.220]  as we know it
[3:06:23.220 --> 3:06:31.220]  new studios in the United Kingdom you are listening to our Joseph Watson
[3:06:34.700 --> 3:06:40.100]  vision of the summit news hour and basically we've been proven right once
[3:06:40.100 --> 3:06:45.140]  again the alarmism the fear mongering the drumbeat the hysteria the propaganda
[3:06:45.140 --> 3:06:49.780]  for a new lockdown or at least the introduction of reintroduction of COVID
[3:06:49.780 --> 3:06:55.380]  restrictions mask mandates social distancing in the United Kingdom has
[3:06:55.380 --> 3:07:00.380]  been raging for the past week and yet what is happening is exactly what we
[3:07:00.380 --> 3:07:05.220]  predicted would happen the spike in cases that the media that the public
[3:07:05.220 --> 3:07:09.500]  health technocrats seized upon to try and justify the reintroduction of
[3:07:09.500 --> 3:07:15.100]  pointless hysterical mask mandates has been proven to be a falsehood once
[3:07:15.100 --> 3:07:20.860]  again last week we said that the spiking cases which by the way there was a
[3:07:20.860 --> 3:07:26.220]  bigger spiking cases on the penultimate day of the previous restrictions when
[3:07:26.220 --> 3:07:30.140]  they were still in place and had been for the previous 10 months that's the
[3:07:30.140 --> 3:07:34.420]  last time COVID cases were the highest in the UK after we've been forced to wear
[3:07:34.420 --> 3:07:40.460]  masks for 10 months because masks work really well we predicted based on the
[3:07:40.460 --> 3:07:45.860]  modeling based on the fact that 50% of COVID cases in the United Kingdom were
[3:07:45.860 --> 3:07:51.340]  as a result of children returning to school and being mass tested university
[3:07:51.340 --> 3:07:56.980]  students returning to their academic years being mass tested and that those
[3:07:56.980 --> 3:08:01.900]  cases would quickly start to plummet yesterday we had this headline up on
[3:08:01.900 --> 3:08:06.980]  summit dot news after clamor for new restrictions modeling says COVID cases
[3:08:06.980 --> 3:08:11.460]  set to plummet in UK and of course this modeling was quietly released a week
[3:08:11.460 --> 3:08:16.100]  after the drumbeat of media fear mongering and alarmism when they pointed
[3:08:16.100 --> 3:08:19.460]  to the high cases and failed to mention the fact that their own modeling
[3:08:19.460 --> 3:08:24.140]  suggested that the cases were about to fall after a week long campaign of
[3:08:24.140 --> 3:08:28.020]  hysterical fear mongering during which the media and public technocrats lobbied
[3:08:28.020 --> 3:08:31.980]  for new restrictions scientific modeling reveals COVID cases in the UK are
[3:08:31.980 --> 3:08:36.300]  actually set to plummet and what have you seen over the past four days and
[3:08:36.300 --> 3:08:42.020]  indeed what have you seen once again today daily mail reports UK's daily
[3:08:42.020 --> 3:08:46.020]  COVID cases fall for third day in a row and they're still calling for
[3:08:46.020 --> 3:08:51.500]  restrictions says daily COVID cases across the UK have fallen for the third
[3:08:51.500 --> 3:08:55.580]  day in a row and hospital admissions of plateaued official data shows all they
[3:08:55.580 --> 3:09:00.140]  will be devastated all the screeching maniacs on Twitter wanting new mask
[3:09:00.140 --> 3:09:05.100]  mandates waiting their day by day day secretly wishing for the cases to go
[3:09:05.100 --> 3:09:08.820]  up because they're nice people they really care about you they're in the mud
[3:09:08.820 --> 3:09:13.860]  they're devastated because now they're beginning to fall once again because the
[3:09:13.860 --> 3:09:18.340]  kids are on half-term break and they're not testing them all the Department of
[3:09:18.340 --> 3:09:23.580]  Health said there were 40,954 new infections in the past 24 hours that's
[3:09:23.580 --> 3:09:28.860]  a 6% fall on the figure last Tuesday and that even includes three days worth of
[3:09:28.860 --> 3:09:32.620]  data from Wales because of a technical glitch that wasn't included in the
[3:09:32.620 --> 3:09:38.580]  previous three days so the week-on-week drop is likely to be even greater
[3:09:38.580 --> 3:09:43.980]  infections have been on the declines in Sunday following an 18-day surge notice
[3:09:43.980 --> 3:09:49.500]  how the media buries this drastic fall in cases at the back of the newspaper or
[3:09:49.500 --> 3:09:54.580]  way down the fold on the website having fear mongered about out-of-control
[3:09:54.580 --> 3:10:02.580]  cases for the best part of the past week more bad news for mask freaks again
[3:10:02.580 --> 3:10:06.420]  from the Daily Mail will Britain be back to normal life by January top government
[3:10:06.420 --> 3:10:12.700]  advisor hints number 10 could drop mass testing at start of 2021 again they will
[3:10:12.700 --> 3:10:16.140]  be devastated Britain's mass coronavirus testing program could be
[3:10:16.140 --> 3:10:20.820]  abandoned in the new year one of the government's experts hinted today this is
[3:10:20.820 --> 3:10:25.380]  Lucy Chapel chief scientific advisor to the Department of Health who told MPs
[3:10:25.380 --> 3:10:29.300]  that they were committed to the routine asymptomatic swabbing scheme until the
[3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:35.300]  end of 2021 only and that beyond January they are going to drop the mass
[3:10:35.300 --> 3:10:39.380]  testing meaning we're not going to get those alarmist headlines in the media
[3:10:39.380 --> 3:10:44.620]  every single day when the cases tick up for example when the kids go back to
[3:10:44.620 --> 3:10:48.620]  school and in fact the government's own modeling that was released yesterday
[3:10:48.620 --> 3:10:55.420]  showed that the cases are going to drop to 5,000 or fewer by Christmas
[3:10:55.420 --> 3:11:01.700]  basically nonexistent whatsoever in fact the thing is Christopher Snowden who
[3:11:01.700 --> 3:11:07.100]  tweeted earlier today and I retweeted it he retweeted the graph on which all
[3:11:07.100 --> 3:11:13.700]  this hysteria is based on the excess deaths in the UK month by month and if
[3:11:13.700 --> 3:11:19.580]  you look at that graph his tweets as new mortality stats from the ONS are out
[3:11:19.580 --> 3:11:26.300]  this is Christopher Snowden on Twitter he points out the graph and you see the
[3:11:26.300 --> 3:11:32.180]  green bars representing the total unrelated COVID deaths in the United
[3:11:32.180 --> 3:11:38.220]  Kingdom day by day and then when you add on the COVID deaths it's literally I'd
[3:11:38.220 --> 3:11:44.460]  say 5% of the total deaths in the United Kingdom we have deaths from heart
[3:11:44.460 --> 3:11:50.700]  disease from strokes from cancers from accidents every single day vastly vastly
[3:11:50.700 --> 3:11:55.940]  outnumbering even at the high of the coronavirus pandemic the actual deaths
[3:11:55.940 --> 3:12:00.300]  from coronavirus but according to the media and the public health technocrats
[3:12:00.300 --> 3:12:06.900]  because of this tiny 5% extra in excess deaths in the United Kingdom the NHS is
[3:12:06.900 --> 3:12:11.820]  going to be overwhelmed we're going to have you know gurneys in the corridors
[3:12:11.820 --> 3:12:16.420]  of hospitals coffins funeral homes are going to be overflowing it's all based
[3:12:16.420 --> 3:12:20.980]  on complete hysteria based on the premise that as a culture we can't handle
[3:12:20.980 --> 3:12:25.220]  death we can't handle the very idea that yes people die they die of
[3:12:25.220 --> 3:12:29.940]  numerable conditions including untreated cancers and all these other serious
[3:12:29.940 --> 3:12:34.580]  illnesses which have drastically worsened since the coronavirus pandemic
[3:12:34.580 --> 3:12:40.180]  started so despite the dropping cases that we predicted all along we still
[3:12:40.180 --> 3:12:45.980]  have these polls being released yet another one today from you gov dubious
[3:12:45.980 --> 3:12:51.900]  you gov poll says vast majority of Brits support COVID restrictions again this
[3:12:51.900 --> 3:12:56.300]  is you gov which by the way as Majid Nawaz points out in this article with his
[3:12:56.300 --> 3:13:03.860]  tweet was founded by former vaccines minister Nadine Zahawi you gov this
[3:13:03.860 --> 3:13:08.300]  polling agency was also is also now currently its major shareholder is
[3:13:08.300 --> 3:13:13.340]  BlackRock BlackRock is a transnational investment firm which according to the
[3:13:13.340 --> 3:13:18.900]  New Republic was quote having a very good pandemic by casting itself as social
[3:13:18.900 --> 3:13:24.020]  responsible last year the BlackRock CEO the investment firm that basically
[3:13:24.020 --> 3:13:29.460]  owns you gov said that Americans should wear face masks if they wish to see any
[3:13:29.460 --> 3:13:34.580]  economic recovery so this investment firm has everything invested in
[3:13:34.580 --> 3:13:38.820]  supporting COVID restrictions supporting lockdowns it's the major
[3:13:38.820 --> 3:13:44.420]  shareholder of the UK's primary polling firm which continually comes out with
[3:13:44.420 --> 3:13:48.860]  these alarmist polls saying that the vast majority of Brits support mask
[3:13:48.860 --> 3:13:55.620]  mandates and they came out with one today saying that 81% of the public
[3:13:55.620 --> 3:14:00.460]  support mandatory masks on public transport 76% support the same rule in
[3:14:00.460 --> 3:14:06.740]  shops and 67% want mandatory social distancing in pubs and restaurants now
[3:14:06.740 --> 3:14:13.220]  I live in London the capital city of England 81% of people aren't wearing
[3:14:13.220 --> 3:14:19.660]  masks on public transport okay about 10% of people I'd say were wearing masks
[3:14:19.660 --> 3:14:26.740]  outdoors public transport it's about 40 60 masks in shops I'd say that was about
[3:14:26.740 --> 3:14:31.960]  50% so the people who are answering these poll surveys saying oh yes we should
[3:14:31.960 --> 3:14:37.100]  force 81% say we should force people to wear masks on public transport they're
[3:14:37.100 --> 3:14:41.340]  not wearing masks on public transport a large proportion of the respondents to
[3:14:41.340 --> 3:14:47.140]  this poll 67% support social distancing in pubs there's no social
[3:14:47.140 --> 3:14:52.660]  distancing in pubs whatsoever there hasn't been for months since they had
[3:14:52.660 --> 3:14:57.580]  that ridiculous rule way could only sit with five other people and you couldn't
[3:14:57.580 --> 3:15:01.340]  even leave the table without putting your face mask on which by the way was
[3:15:01.340 --> 3:15:06.340]  when we had the record covid cases what a coincidence that is nobody's social
[3:15:06.340 --> 3:15:11.380]  distancing in pubs so when they ask the public and they say 67% of the public is
[3:15:11.380 --> 3:15:17.900]  once social distancing in pubs only about 10% of the public is actually doing
[3:15:17.900 --> 3:15:22.300]  that these polls are completely skewed they're phoning up old people with
[3:15:22.300 --> 3:15:27.460]  home phones who are permanently terrified locked inside and they're getting
[3:15:27.460 --> 3:15:32.180]  the right answers the responsible answers that people think they need to give
[3:15:32.180 --> 3:15:38.100]  to the pollsters when in reality by their own metric of behavior they're not
[3:15:38.100 --> 3:15:43.180]  wearing masks in shops they're not wearing masks on public transport they're
[3:15:43.180 --> 3:15:48.140]  not social distancing in pubs these polls are meant to lead public opinion
[3:15:48.140 --> 3:15:53.140]  manipulate public opinion not measure public opinion some of it don't use
[3:15:53.140 --> 3:15:57.940]  what if you could

[3:18:23.180 --> 3:18:29.260]  prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system and in a way
[3:18:29.260 --> 3:18:34.260]  they're right if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us destroy

[3:19:56.380 --> 3:20:03.500]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:07.740 --> 3:20:16.020]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson
[3:20:16.020 --> 3:20:25.140]  you're back and let's round up the news from Britain regarding the imminent or
[3:20:25.140 --> 3:20:29.620]  attempted imminent reimposition of Covid restrictions which as these cases are
[3:20:29.620 --> 3:20:33.580]  falling doesn't look like the lockdown zealots are going to have the political
[3:20:33.580 --> 3:20:36.660]  capital to carry through but we've seen it before where the government's
[3:20:36.660 --> 3:20:40.500]  promise not to reintroduce lockdowns promise not to introduce vaccine
[3:20:40.500 --> 3:20:43.860]  passports and they've gone ahead and done it on some level on the issue of
[3:20:43.860 --> 3:20:49.100]  vaccine passports of course last week in Ireland where you have to present a
[3:20:49.100 --> 3:20:55.100]  vaccine passport to get into a coffee shop or a pub they announced that people
[3:20:55.100 --> 3:20:59.220]  entering nightclubs in Ireland having delayed the lifting of restrictions
[3:20:59.220 --> 3:21:03.180]  would not only have to present a vaccine passport the option of course of
[3:21:03.180 --> 3:21:07.300]  providing a negative Covid test is completely removed despite the fact
[3:21:07.300 --> 3:21:11.500]  that the vaccinated can carry and transmit the virus you know who can't
[3:21:11.500 --> 3:21:15.340]  transmit the virus is people who don't have the virus but they're not allowed
[3:21:15.340 --> 3:21:19.420]  into the nightclub if you get into the nightclub though you will have to wear
[3:21:19.420 --> 3:21:25.060]  a mask but apart from when you're eating drinking or dancing because
[3:21:25.060 --> 3:21:29.460]  apparently Covid-19 virus has developed some kind of artificial intelligence
[3:21:29.460 --> 3:21:34.180]  where it knows when you're dancing when you're rubbing up against two does
[3:21:34.180 --> 3:21:38.740]  another sweaty people in close proximity don't have to wear a mask then
[3:21:38.740 --> 3:21:43.260]  that's Covid safe but as soon as you start to leave the dance floor and walk
[3:21:43.260 --> 3:21:48.100]  either to the bathroom or to the bar to buy a drink then Covid knows that you've
[3:21:48.100 --> 3:21:53.300]  stopped dancing you have to put the mask back on because that behavior is not
[3:21:53.300 --> 3:21:57.820]  Covid safe and if you think that makes no sense it's because that's precisely
[3:21:57.820 --> 3:22:02.140]  the case it's not meant to make sense it's about forcing you to humiliate
[3:22:02.140 --> 3:22:06.660]  yourselves and basically comply with anything there was a government study
[3:22:06.660 --> 3:22:12.220]  by the way just a touch on this last week deleted government report celebrates
[3:22:12.220 --> 3:22:17.620]  how public loves to conform and again they're expressing their disbelief
[3:22:17.620 --> 3:22:22.100]  basically at the fact how quickly the public the general public in Britain
[3:22:22.100 --> 3:22:25.820]  complied with these demands during the first lockdown of course we have
[3:22:25.820 --> 3:22:31.260]  Professor pants down Neil Ferguson expressed shock that they could implement
[3:22:31.260 --> 3:22:35.540]  the same policies that the communist Chinese government did and get away with
[3:22:35.540 --> 3:22:39.900]  it well now this leaked government report which they hastily deleted within
[3:22:39.900 --> 3:22:45.300]  hours of it going up so they've created a population with a quote deep set
[3:22:45.300 --> 3:22:49.860]  reverence for authority and a quote powerful tendency to conform this
[3:22:49.860 --> 3:22:53.540]  behavior they noted didn't really exist or at least they thought it didn't
[3:22:53.540 --> 3:22:58.580]  exist to anywhere near that degree within the British public before this mass
[3:22:58.580 --> 3:23:03.580]  hysteria campaign that carried the first lockdown and all the lockdowns after
[3:23:03.580 --> 3:23:08.460]  that so you have the government expressing shock at how compliant the
[3:23:08.460 --> 3:23:12.140]  British population has been we know why they became so compliant because the
[3:23:12.140 --> 3:23:16.340]  government literally teamed up teamed up with behavioral psychologists who
[3:23:16.340 --> 3:23:21.340]  weaponized behavioral psychology to exaggerate the threat posed by COVID
[3:23:21.340 --> 3:23:26.020]  their words not mine and use quote totalitarian and unethical methods of
[3:23:26.020 --> 3:23:31.220]  brainwashing to instill fear into the population again by exaggerating the
[3:23:31.220 --> 3:23:37.860]  threat posed by COVID there was a poll done last August 2020 which found that
[3:23:37.860 --> 3:23:44.060]  the average Brit thought 100 times more people than had actually died died from
[3:23:44.060 --> 3:23:49.700]  COVID that's how effective this quote totalitarian behavioral psychology
[3:23:49.700 --> 3:23:54.100]  brainwashing was and it's turned a vast majority of the British population into
[3:23:54.100 --> 3:23:58.540]  spineless cowards which is why you will get polls which show a vast majority of
[3:23:58.540 --> 3:24:01.700]  them still support mask mandates even though I think those numbers are
[3:24:01.700 --> 3:24:05.620]  inflated there is still a huge chunk of the British public who have been
[3:24:05.620 --> 3:24:10.140]  terrified into total obedience and submission and will be the years to come
[3:24:10.140 --> 3:24:15.460]  the disastrous consequences of that will prolong for years and years to come as
[3:24:15.460 --> 3:24:22.860]  will the economic impacts reimposing COVID restrictions would cost UK up to 18
[3:24:22.860 --> 3:24:27.820]  billion pounds headline of summit news Boris Johnson has been one any move to
[3:24:27.820 --> 3:24:31.980]  reimpose COVID restrictions would last until at least March 2022 and could
[3:24:31.980 --> 3:24:36.580]  cost the economy up to 18 billion pounds again lost jobs I'm not going in any
[3:24:36.580 --> 3:24:41.220]  premise any business any bar restaurant then forces mask mandates ever again and
[3:24:41.220 --> 3:24:44.540]  there are millions of people in Britain who will behave the same and so that
[3:24:44.540 --> 3:24:50.300]  industry will go out of business they tried to get it through in Scotland it's
[3:24:50.300 --> 3:24:56.540]  been a quote unmitigated disaster they're having fights with people trying to get
[3:24:56.540 --> 3:25:02.380]  into the nightclubs the technology keeps crashing it's been a total cluster F now
[3:25:02.380 --> 3:25:05.860]  we have this headline leaked government report finds vaccine passports can
[3:25:05.860 --> 3:25:10.540]  actually increase spread of COVID a leaked government reports found vaccine
[3:25:10.540 --> 3:25:13.420]  passports can actually exacerbate the spread of COVID because they would
[3:25:13.420 --> 3:25:18.260]  encourage people to visit smaller more poorly ventilated venues again you're
[3:25:18.260 --> 3:25:23.260]  going to have a hard court of people in the United Kingdom in Ireland in Wales
[3:25:23.260 --> 3:25:28.100]  where they got that dodgy vote through because one MP can vote properly who will
[3:25:28.100 --> 3:25:33.340]  simply refuse to patronize these venues these pubs clubs businesses they'll go
[3:25:33.340 --> 3:25:39.380]  out of business they're operating profit margin is 15% you take away even 5% of
[3:25:39.380 --> 3:25:45.420]  that they go out of business it's completely unsustainable and yet they're
[3:25:45.420 --> 3:25:49.460]  still trying to get these measures reimposed
[3:25:49.460 --> 3:25:54.860]  meanwhile in Denmark Denmark reports highest infection rates since May
[3:25:54.860 --> 3:26:00.740]  despite 75% of population being fully vaccinated oh gee what could be happening
[3:26:00.740 --> 3:26:08.020]  here is the virus the vaccine completely useless remember Gibraltar 99% of the
[3:26:08.020 --> 3:26:13.660]  population vaccinated about a month ago they had that highest COVID infection
[3:26:13.660 --> 3:26:20.100]  rate ever that's not a pandemic of the unvaccinated is it if 99% of your
[3:26:20.100 --> 3:26:24.700]  population is vaccinated and you record the highest number of COVID cases ever
[3:26:24.700 --> 3:26:29.940]  can't blame that on the unjabbed can they now Denmark has reported its highest
[3:26:29.940 --> 3:26:34.060]  COVID-19 case flow since May by the fact over 75% of population is fully
[3:26:34.060 --> 3:26:40.540]  vaccinated total of 1349 people in the Scandinavian country tested positive
[3:26:40.540 --> 3:26:46.340]  over the last 40 24 hours the country's virus reproduction number has also jumped
[3:26:46.340 --> 3:26:52.420]  to 2.01 which is the highest level since January which is when they started to
[3:26:52.420 --> 3:26:57.700]  roll out the vaccine highest case toll since May highest virus reproduction
[3:26:57.700 --> 3:27:03.020]  number since January Ross killed University epidemiologist Vigo
[3:27:03.020 --> 3:27:08.100]  Andreessen told TV2 these figures are not a disaster but if they continue to
[3:27:08.100 --> 3:27:13.700]  rise it points in the direction that we must do something and that something is
[3:27:13.700 --> 3:27:19.900]  booster shots until Kingdom come meanwhile Austria threatens a new
[3:27:19.900 --> 3:27:23.540]  lockdown for the unvaccinated yes they're actually going ahead with it
[3:27:23.540 --> 3:27:27.860]  Austria threatening to impose a new lockdown on its citizens for this time
[3:27:27.860 --> 3:27:32.220]  around it will only apply to the unvaccinated they've got 65% of their
[3:27:32.220 --> 3:27:36.860]  population fully vaccinated and yet they're experiencing another COVID spike
[3:27:36.860 --> 3:27:42.540]  so they basically said if the ICU occupation beds jumps from its current
[3:27:42.540 --> 3:27:49.220]  level which is 220 to 500 vaccine passports will be reintroduced because
[3:27:49.220 --> 3:27:52.540]  they work so well the first time meaning the unvaccinated will be barred from
[3:27:52.540 --> 3:27:57.220]  entering venues such as restaurants and hotels then if the ICU number rises to
[3:27:57.220 --> 3:28:02.540]  600 or one-third of total ICU capacity the government will force the
[3:28:02.540 --> 3:28:06.860]  unvaccinated to self-isolate at home indefinitely allowing them to leave only
[3:28:06.860 --> 3:28:11.900]  for essential reasons we saw the New Zealand Prime Minister Ardern yesterday
[3:28:11.900 --> 3:28:17.660]  come out and say yeah admit it brazenly they're creating a two tier society the
[3:28:17.660 --> 3:28:22.740]  vaxed and the unvaxed and they're now openly going to discriminate against the
[3:28:22.740 --> 3:28:29.100]  unvaccinated despite the fact that over half of the minority Maori population in
[3:28:29.100 --> 3:28:35.220]  New Zealand is unvaccinated so how ironic is it they're introducing the same
[3:28:35.220 --> 3:28:40.380]  discrimination and segregation laws which will primarily affect this racial
[3:28:40.380 --> 3:28:44.300]  minority the same segregation and discrimination laws that were so
[3:28:44.300 --> 3:28:48.980]  abhorrent that were obliterated and all abolished abolished in the 1950s in
[3:28:48.980 --> 3:28:52.860]  New Zealand those same rules are coming back and they're going to impact the
[3:28:52.860 --> 3:28:58.500]  Maori population once again something don't use you know I'm sitting here it's
[3:28:58.500 --> 3:29:05.020]  in the early morning hours and I'm looking at mainstream news reporting
[3:29:05.020 --> 3:29:08.820]  on the fact that even the controlled revolving door FDA has come out and said
[3:29:08.820 --> 3:29:13.500]  that the Moderna and Pfizer shots need to be held up and not authorized for
[3:29:13.500 --> 3:29:18.060]  children because in studies they did on children it caused myocarditis that
[3:29:18.060 --> 3:29:22.420]  starts swelling our attacks and then I noticed that even though this is even in
[3:29:22.420 --> 3:29:26.460]  the Associated Press it's not getting any circulation it's not on the national
[3:29:26.460 --> 3:29:29.820]  news and it's very hard to even find on places like Instagram or Twitter it's
[3:29:29.820 --> 3:29:35.460]  just crazy and then Fauci was on TV just yesterday saying there's no damage from
[3:29:35.460 --> 3:29:39.060]  the vaccines it doesn't hurt anybody you're conspiracy theorist if you say
[3:29:39.060 --> 3:29:43.380]  it's just crazy and then we have all the scientists who over a year ago came out
[3:29:43.380 --> 3:29:46.700]  and said these vaccines are gonna cause heart problems they gave the exact
[3:29:46.700 --> 3:29:51.540]  reasons why and now it happened that's why info wars is on air because if we
[3:29:51.540 --> 3:29:55.060]  weren't on air they get away with even more of this crap this is just insane
[3:29:55.060 --> 3:29:59.300]  these people are killers you're listening to this message in the weekend of

[3:32:53.340 --> 3:32:57.020]  the M4 and M4store.com
[3:32:57.020 --> 3:33:03.580]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:33:09.460 --> 3:33:19.260]  live from London England it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News
[3:33:19.900 --> 3:33:25.460]  I talked about the creation of a two-tier society open discrimination
[3:33:25.460 --> 3:33:31.020]  against what is now in many countries an oppressed minority the unvaccinated not
[3:33:31.020 --> 3:33:36.260]  only being treated as walking biological hazards even as domestic terrorists in
[3:33:36.260 --> 3:33:40.580]  some countries now well in New Zealand the Prime Minister a couple of days ago
[3:33:40.580 --> 3:33:46.180]  openly announced with glee and lip smacking satisfaction on her face that
[3:33:46.180 --> 3:33:50.460]  that's precisely what they had done created a two-tier society the jabbed
[3:33:50.460 --> 3:33:56.580]  and the jab not and here's an analysis of her comments let's roll it you've
[3:33:56.580 --> 3:34:00.300]  probably seen the clip by now New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern
[3:34:00.300 --> 3:34:05.420]  relishing the fact that her new COVID traffic light system will create an
[3:34:05.420 --> 3:34:10.860]  oppressed underclass in society so you basically said this is going to be like
[3:34:10.860 --> 3:34:14.660]  almost you probably don't see like this the two different classes of people if
[3:34:14.660 --> 3:34:17.340]  you're vaccinated or if you're unvaccinated you have all these rights if
[3:34:17.340 --> 3:34:22.980]  you are vaccinated that is what it is so yep yep under the new system when cases
[3:34:22.980 --> 3:34:27.420]  rise the unvaccinated will face lockdowns and restrictions that the rest of the
[3:34:27.420 --> 3:34:31.300]  population can ignore all together actually what it's become clear to me so
[3:34:31.300 --> 3:34:35.540]  they're not just a tool to drive up vaccines there are two for confidence
[3:34:35.540 --> 3:34:40.220]  yeah so confident you're all walking around fully vaccinated and still
[3:34:40.220 --> 3:34:43.700]  wearing three face masks two different classes of people if you're vaccinated
[3:34:43.700 --> 3:34:46.940]  or if you're unvaccinated you have all these rights if you are vaccinated that
[3:34:46.940 --> 3:34:52.660]  is what it is so yep yep let's be clear by its very definition this is medical
[3:34:52.660 --> 3:34:57.860]  apartheid two classes of people under two different sets of laws in the same
[3:34:57.860 --> 3:35:03.380]  country one an oppressed minority that is now being overtly discriminated against
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:07.620]  by the state that's not a free country anymore that's institutionalized
[3:35:07.620 --> 3:35:12.620]  segregation if that was our porrant in South Africa why is it acceptable now
[3:35:12.620 --> 3:35:16.700]  New Zealand's Maori population was subjected to similar segregation and
[3:35:16.700 --> 3:35:21.260]  discrimination up until the 50s if that was a disgrace why should it be
[3:35:21.260 --> 3:35:26.420]  acceptable now and in fact fewer than half of Maori's in New Zealand are
[3:35:26.420 --> 3:35:30.460]  fully vaccinated meaning they're gonna take the brunt of the discrimination and
[3:35:30.460 --> 3:35:33.980]  I can see what's coming in New Zealand probably Australia too people in
[3:35:33.980 --> 3:35:38.740]  America are already being denied life-saving organ transplants so don't
[3:35:38.740 --> 3:35:43.700]  be surprised to see Jacinda announced that the unvaccinated will be denied
[3:35:43.700 --> 3:35:47.900]  hospital treatment and the look on her face when she does it will be one of
[3:35:47.900 --> 3:35:53.100]  barely contained sadistic glee look if you're so confident in your vaccine
[3:35:53.100 --> 3:35:58.420]  explain to people why it's so important and why the side effects are so rare
[3:35:58.420 --> 3:36:02.700]  don't just threaten to banish people from society while wearing a shit-eating
[3:36:02.700 --> 3:36:07.540]  tyrannical grin because that's not a very good way to get people on side is
[3:36:07.540 --> 3:36:11.460]  it it's not even the fact that she's the face for all this despotism it's that
[3:36:11.460 --> 3:36:16.420]  lip-smacking satisfaction that she seems to get from announcing it like she's
[3:36:16.420 --> 3:36:21.780]  savoring some fine meal or expensive glass of wine that is what it is so yep
[3:36:21.780 --> 3:36:26.740]  it's also that fake smiley passive-aggressive contrived self-righteousness
[3:36:26.740 --> 3:36:30.620]  that characterizes her rhetoric like when she threatened to hold kiwis in
[3:36:30.620 --> 3:36:34.700]  their entire families in quarantine facilities if they didn't get the jab
[3:36:34.700 --> 3:36:42.060]  what do we do if someone refuses to be tested well they can't now if someone refuses in our facilities to
[3:36:42.060 --> 3:36:46.740]  be tested they have to keep staying so they won't be able to leave after 14
[3:36:46.740 --> 3:36:51.580]  days they have to stay on for another 14 days so it's a pretty good incentive you
[3:36:51.580 --> 3:36:55.820]  either get your tests done and make sure you're cleared or we will keep you in a
[3:36:55.820 --> 3:37:00.060]  facility longer we will keep you in a facility longer is it just me or is
[3:37:00.060 --> 3:37:04.140]  there something about her that really creeps you out people forget New Zealand
[3:37:04.140 --> 3:37:08.060]  was rapidly becoming a police state before the pandemic police were paying
[3:37:08.060 --> 3:37:12.980]  people home visits to ask about their support for Trump in early 2019 kiwis
[3:37:12.980 --> 3:37:16.500]  were threatened with five years in prison for not handing in firearms after
[3:37:16.500 --> 3:37:21.380]  Jacinda set about on a massive gun grab suffice to say the daughter of a police
[3:37:21.380 --> 3:37:26.460]  officer and the former head of the international socialist youth is adored
[3:37:26.460 --> 3:37:31.340]  and revered by her fellow globalists and boy does she appear to cherish the role
[3:37:31.340 --> 3:37:36.340]  given that the bond franchise is seeking to increase its diversity in offering
[3:37:36.340 --> 3:37:41.340]  more roles to women now suggest Jacinda or Dern is the perfect template for
[3:37:41.340 --> 3:37:50.740]  their next top villain yep yeah yeah I'm gonna move on to some culture war news
[3:37:50.740 --> 3:37:54.340]  now and play this next video because I'm gonna come back after and talk about
[3:37:54.340 --> 3:37:59.620]  the latest on the take an e controversy they're forcing another sports team to
[3:37:59.620 --> 3:38:04.860]  take a knee against their own wishes first though it is still black history
[3:38:04.860 --> 3:38:08.980]  months and the United Kingdom has been broadcasting on its major TV stations a
[3:38:08.980 --> 3:38:13.100]  bunch of programs about black celebrities trying to find their roots and
[3:38:13.100 --> 3:38:19.020]  with a specific focus on their ancestors being trafficked in slavery and then
[3:38:19.020 --> 3:38:23.100]  that was used again to make the white viewers feel guilty but it's already
[3:38:23.100 --> 3:38:28.300]  backfired spectacularly a couple of times and this is yet another example this
[3:38:28.300 --> 3:38:33.340]  is black celebrity finds out her ancestor was a white slave owner let's roll
[3:38:33.340 --> 3:38:39.180]  the clip another TV diversity darling has uncovered some awkward news at five
[3:38:39.180 --> 3:38:43.340]  times great-grandfather was white and own slaves well that wasn't supposed to
[3:38:43.340 --> 3:38:47.500]  happen TV networks in the UK are marking black history month by having black
[3:38:47.500 --> 3:38:51.700]  celebrities uncover the history of their ancestors but the discoveries aren't
[3:38:51.700 --> 3:38:55.700]  exactly playing into their planned narrative as I covered last week BBC
[3:38:55.700 --> 3:39:00.460]  diversity hire Alex Scott cried after finding out her four times great-grand
[3:39:00.460 --> 3:39:05.660]  father owned 26 slaves in Jamaica he was black again emphasizing how black
[3:39:05.660 --> 3:39:09.860]  tribal leaders sold their own people into slavery but now in the space of a
[3:39:09.860 --> 3:39:14.340]  single week it's happened again TV presenter Charlene White a funny
[3:39:14.340 --> 3:39:19.220]  surname given the circumstances appeared on itv's documentary Empire's Child the
[3:39:19.220 --> 3:39:23.380]  appearance was ostensibly an exercise in the presenter detailing how her
[3:39:23.380 --> 3:39:28.260]  ancestors were sold into slavery by evil whitey and then for the TV show to make
[3:39:28.260 --> 3:39:32.980]  white viewers feel guilty about it turns out whites ancestors were sold into
[3:39:32.980 --> 3:39:38.860]  slavery by their own father Diane has discovered a man named John Stambry and
[3:39:38.860 --> 3:39:44.420]  he was registered as the owner of slaves so John Stambry was white yes he was
[3:39:44.420 --> 3:39:55.340]  John Stambry was my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather
[3:39:55.940 --> 3:40:01.860]  well this is strange oops narrative failed so Scots ancestor was black he
[3:40:01.860 --> 3:40:07.420]  owned slaves white ancestor was white he owned slaves and that's the point every
[3:40:07.420 --> 3:40:11.540]  culture creed and ethnicity throughout history owned slaves yet for some
[3:40:11.540 --> 3:40:17.020]  bizarre reason history only teaches kids that it was all whitey's fault even
[3:40:17.020 --> 3:40:20.900]  though white Europeans literally risked their own lives to travel to Africa and
[3:40:20.900 --> 3:40:24.220]  free the slaves and Britain was the first nation on the planet to legally
[3:40:24.220 --> 3:40:28.380]  abolish slavery and modern slavery still exists in brown and black countries no
[3:40:28.380 --> 3:40:34.860]  it's all our fault colonialism bad old white men bad now let's tear down some
[3:40:34.860 --> 3:40:38.500]  statues and gimme that reparations
[3:40:38.500 --> 3:40:44.580]  now in the latest perpetual effort to make white people feel guilty for
[3:40:44.580 --> 3:40:48.420]  things which they never did South African cricket players ordered to take a
[3:40:48.420 --> 3:40:53.460]  knee before T20 World Cup South African cricket players have been ordered to
[3:40:53.460 --> 3:40:58.780]  take a knee before their teams T20 World Cup matches basically because some of
[3:40:58.780 --> 3:41:02.420]  them didn't do it so now they're enforcing it and saying it's mandatory
[3:41:02.420 --> 3:41:05.660]  cricket South Africa issued the directive after some of the players
[3:41:05.660 --> 3:41:09.940]  refused to perform the pro BLM virtue signaling gesture before a match against
[3:41:09.940 --> 3:41:13.780]  Australia what's interesting about this is that we've had this debate in the
[3:41:13.780 --> 3:41:18.860]  United Kingdom should footballers take a knee with the advocates for that
[3:41:18.860 --> 3:41:23.340]  position claiming oh it's got nothing to do with BLM it's nothing political it's
[3:41:23.340 --> 3:41:28.540]  not a political gesture it's just a generic anti-racism stance well in this
[3:41:28.540 --> 3:41:33.660]  announcement by the CSA this official cricket board of South Africa it said
[3:41:33.660 --> 3:41:37.820]  it was enforcing the order due to quote the lack of support for the initiative
[3:41:37.820 --> 3:41:43.980]  and they named it as a BLM initiative so no it's not just a generic anti-racism
[3:41:43.980 --> 3:41:48.180]  gesture it's a deliberate show of support for this violent extremist hate
[3:41:48.180 --> 3:41:53.860]  group called Black Lives Matter now some of the players complained they refused
[3:41:53.860 --> 3:41:57.500]  to take a knee because the gesture was quote against their religious beliefs and
[3:41:57.500 --> 3:42:01.060]  against what anything that a good Christian man only takes a knee for two
[3:42:01.060 --> 3:42:05.380]  people his wife and his god so even though they're literally saying it's
[3:42:05.380 --> 3:42:08.340]  against their religious beliefs they only take a knee for their wives or for
[3:42:08.340 --> 3:42:12.460]  God they're being forced to do it anyway or presumably they'll be kicked out of
[3:42:12.460 --> 3:42:18.100]  the tournament all together an update on this story that Quinton did not South
[3:42:18.100 --> 3:42:22.340]  Africa cricketer misses T20 World Cup game against West Indies after refusing
[3:42:22.340 --> 3:42:27.500]  to take the knee he's withdrawn from their T20 World Cup match after refusing to
[3:42:27.500 --> 3:42:32.500]  perform the gesture so at least one of the South African cricketers is actually
[3:42:32.500 --> 3:42:36.540]  standing up for their beliefs maybe if more do the same they'll have to leave
[3:42:36.540 --> 3:42:40.380]  the squad at the tournament itself will be completely upended and this
[3:42:40.380 --> 3:42:46.100]  ridiculous empty virtue signaling gesturing fast performance in nonsense
[3:42:46.100 --> 3:42:50.780]  will be rolled back yet again we'll be back to the final segment so it not

[3:45:55.260 --> 3:45:59.940]  we've all heard about the pastor and his famous statement from inside a
[3:45:59.940 --> 3:46:04.020]  concentration camp in World War two that when they came for one group he
[3:46:04.020 --> 3:46:07.420]  wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another
[3:46:07.420 --> 3:46:12.020]  group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally when they
[3:46:12.020 --> 3:46:15.180]  came for him there was nobody else to stand up well the global social credit
[3:46:15.180 --> 3:46:17.940]  score that China is putting in it's banning people the three hours of
[3:46:17.940 --> 3:46:21.260]  video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy or
[3:46:21.260 --> 3:46:25.060]  sell again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world and
[3:46:25.060 --> 3:46:29.260]  the guys of COVID vaccine passports they even admit it now they're saying it's
[3:46:29.260 --> 3:46:32.740]  gonna be a carbon tax attached to it they're gonna track where you go what you
[3:46:32.740 --> 3:46:36.940]  do and decide where you can go and what you can do that's what the lockdowns are
[3:46:36.940 --> 3:46:42.140]  about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again the left is having fun
[3:46:42.140 --> 3:46:45.180]  right now all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're part of the
[3:46:45.180 --> 3:46:48.940]  power structure but they're all gonna be targeted by this nightmare as well we
[3:46:48.940 --> 3:46:52.140]  need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be
[3:46:52.140 --> 3:46:59.260]  enslaved by this horrible technocracy run by the globalist you're listening to
[3:46:59.260 --> 3:47:11.100]  the alex jones show
[3:47:11.100 --> 3:47:16.460]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the
[3:47:16.460 --> 3:47:22.060]  United Kingdom it's Paul Joseph Watson
[3:47:22.060 --> 3:47:26.940]  I'm gonna come back after this final video and hit some final news stories
[3:47:26.940 --> 3:47:30.860]  including how the study in Italy has found that the five most dangerous cities
[3:47:30.860 --> 3:47:36.420]  in Italy are all governed by leftists the surprise that is and I'm gonna talk
[3:47:36.420 --> 3:47:41.860]  about why climate activists in the UK who keep gluing their faces to the road
[3:47:41.860 --> 3:47:47.100]  blocking traffic causing accidents are shocked that they're not getting arrested
[3:47:47.100 --> 3:47:51.660]  and put in prison gee I wonder why that is gonna come back and explain that but
[3:47:51.660 --> 3:47:56.340]  first furthering from our previous segment where we had the Prime Minister
[3:47:56.340 --> 3:48:01.380]  of New Zealand talking about how she's proudly creating a new form of segregation
[3:48:01.380 --> 3:48:05.660]  and openly discriminating against the unvaccinated we have Nigel Farage here
[3:48:05.660 --> 3:48:11.020]  talking about the true consequences of what such a policy entails in this video
[3:48:11.020 --> 3:48:16.900]  the jabbed and the jab not here it is we hear so much these days about division
[3:48:16.900 --> 3:48:20.820]  in society well let me tell you about a new division that is emerging and one
[3:48:20.820 --> 3:48:26.500]  that I think is really worrying and perhaps even a touch sinister the Western
[3:48:26.500 --> 3:48:32.900]  world is about to divide into the jabbed and the jab not I'm not joking just
[3:48:32.900 --> 3:48:37.380]  think about what New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda adern said in an
[3:48:37.380 --> 3:48:41.420]  interview just yesterday have a look at this clip
[3:48:41.420 --> 3:48:45.500]  you basically said this is gonna be like well it's almost like you probably don't
[3:48:45.500 --> 3:48:48.500]  see like this at two different classes of people if you're vaccinated or if you're
[3:48:48.500 --> 3:48:52.540]  unvaccinated you have all these rights if you are vaccinated that is what it is so
[3:48:52.540 --> 3:48:58.620]  yep so she confirms it there will be two classes of citizen in New Zealand those
[3:48:58.620 --> 3:49:02.620]  able to go about their normal lives and their business the jabbed but the jab
[3:49:02.620 --> 3:49:09.020]  nots will be complete total outcast she even suggests that those that have had
[3:49:09.020 --> 3:49:15.740]  the jab will not wish to mix with those that haven't had the jab as if the
[3:49:15.740 --> 3:49:20.940]  unjabbed are to become the modern-day social lepers it's incredible but let's
[3:49:20.940 --> 3:49:24.260]  come to Europe Austria the new Chancellor of Austria
[3:49:24.260 --> 3:49:30.660]  Schellenberg he is now seriously considering locking down locking down
[3:49:30.660 --> 3:49:36.700]  forcing people to stay in their houses if they're unjabbed this only happens if
[3:49:36.700 --> 3:49:41.700]  case numbers rise which could easily happen but can you imagine that one group
[3:49:41.700 --> 3:49:45.380]  with a population forced to stay at home the other part of the population
[3:49:45.380 --> 3:49:50.380]  allowed to go to work one group have been jabbed one group haven't been jabbed
[3:49:50.380 --> 3:49:56.060]  and I'll come in a minute to why this doesn't actually make any sense already
[3:49:56.060 --> 3:50:01.020]  we've seen in Scotland that the idea of passports for those that have had the jab
[3:50:01.020 --> 3:50:06.100]  to get into nighttime venues and nightclubs complete unmitigated disaster
[3:50:06.100 --> 3:50:12.260]  foot fall down 40% over the weekend and of course you know aggro on the doors of
[3:50:12.260 --> 3:50:17.140]  clubs if people can't prove they've got the passport and now we're having a
[3:50:17.140 --> 3:50:23.260]  debate in this country already in the care sector they've been told that by
[3:50:23.260 --> 3:50:29.500]  next month unless they've had the jab they will not have a job and 30,000 so
[3:50:29.500 --> 3:50:34.020]  far have refused to do so now we have such a jab it on you health secretary
[3:50:34.020 --> 3:50:38.780]  saying he is leaning heavily towards which means he's made his mind up that
[3:50:38.780 --> 3:50:42.740]  everybody in the NHS must have the jab if they continue if they're to
[3:50:42.740 --> 3:50:47.540]  continue in their job now that makes no sense because half of them work in admin
[3:50:47.540 --> 3:50:52.260]  in offices and never actually ever go and meet a patient but here's the real
[3:50:52.260 --> 3:51:00.500]  thing if I thought that an elderly relative of mine in a care home or in a
[3:51:00.500 --> 3:51:07.900]  hospital if I thought they were much greater risk of contracting this
[3:51:07.900 --> 3:51:14.900]  horrible virus from somebody who'd not had the jab I might think differently and
[3:51:14.900 --> 3:51:20.980]  I fully and absolutely accept that but Boris Johnson himself this week has
[3:51:20.980 --> 3:51:27.940]  said that having the jab doesn't stop you catching the virus and doesn't stop
[3:51:27.940 --> 3:51:32.460]  you spreading the virus now I think he was one of those Boris isms where he
[3:51:32.460 --> 3:51:36.700]  just you know speaks out says what he really thinks and then they do their
[3:51:36.700 --> 3:51:42.500]  best to bury it there is no evidence that having the jab stops you spreading
[3:51:42.500 --> 3:51:48.260]  the illness there is evidence and strong evidence that having the jab if you then
[3:51:48.260 --> 3:51:52.300]  catch the virus means your chances of being hospitalized your chances of
[3:51:52.300 --> 3:51:58.420]  being less ill improve massively and look I've had the double jab no question
[3:51:58.420 --> 3:52:03.020]  about it I'm 57 I've smoked for a number of years to me it makes absolute
[3:52:03.020 --> 3:52:09.900]  sense and I'm completely convinced by the evidence that those with the jab get
[3:52:09.900 --> 3:52:15.140]  less ill I'm not fighting you know against having jabs done I'm just
[3:52:15.140 --> 3:52:20.020]  saying that I respect the rights of those who don't wish for ever reason to
[3:52:20.020 --> 3:52:23.900]  have the jab for them to be classed as jab nots to find themselves whether it's
[3:52:23.900 --> 3:52:28.060]  in terms of work or socially or anything else maybe during a future lockdown
[3:52:28.060 --> 3:52:32.980]  treated differently to the rest of the population does not make sense I repeat
[3:52:32.980 --> 3:52:38.260]  my point if having the jab meant you couldn't contract and carry the virus
[3:52:38.260 --> 3:52:42.620]  then I might begin to understand why politicians at what what a crackdown as
[3:52:42.620 --> 3:52:47.220]  hard as they do all I see is in the name of the pandemic central government
[3:52:47.220 --> 3:52:50.700]  getting bigger central government getting more powerful and our liberties
[3:52:50.700 --> 3:52:55.820]  being seriously eroded I don't want to live in a two-tier society I don't want
[3:52:55.820 --> 3:53:00.340]  to live in a society where those who for reasons of conscience or belief don't
[3:53:00.340 --> 3:53:04.780]  choose to be jabbed being effectively social outclass I think the whole thing
[3:53:04.780 --> 3:53:10.580]  is completely and utterly loathsome but I can see with what's actually jabbed and
[3:53:10.580 --> 3:53:14.940]  said we could be heading in that direction Boris Johnson RPM despite
[3:53:14.940 --> 3:53:20.580]  that outburst of honesty when he spoke about the virus says he doesn't want
[3:53:20.580 --> 3:53:24.060]  us to introduce passports for this kind of thing well all the way through this
[3:53:24.060 --> 3:53:27.980]  pandemic from the very beginning the British Prime Minister has promised he
[3:53:27.980 --> 3:53:32.900]  wouldn't do things because he believes in civil liberties apparently and then he
[3:53:32.900 --> 3:53:38.220]  does them and I want all of us to keep as much pressure on our MPs on our
[3:53:38.220 --> 3:53:43.620]  lawmakers at all level to say we do not want to live in a two-tiered society
[3:53:43.620 --> 3:53:49.220]  that would be real divide that would lead to unrest that would be wholly
[3:53:49.220 --> 3:53:56.780]  undesirable there was Nigel Farage moving on because we only got a few minutes
[3:53:56.780 --> 3:54:02.060]  left RT reports YouTube temporarily deletes prominent leftist news channel
[3:54:02.060 --> 3:54:07.980]  Navarra media triggering outcry and oh my god was there an outcry YouTube wipe
[3:54:07.980 --> 3:54:11.020]  Navarra media or left-wing news and commentary channel from its platform
[3:54:11.020 --> 3:54:13.260]  before reversing the move shortly afterwards
[3:54:13.260 --> 3:54:16.860]  conservatives already used to big tech censorship were not surprised and
[3:54:16.860 --> 3:54:21.500]  therein lies the problem this left-wing news channel was deleted for whatever
[3:54:21.500 --> 3:54:26.460]  reason I don't know on a technicality a copyright issue whatever within an hour
[3:54:26.460 --> 3:54:32.340]  of it being deleted you had 10 prominent labor MPs demanding that Google
[3:54:32.340 --> 3:54:36.780]  YouTube reinstate this channel but above and beyond that you had
[3:54:36.780 --> 3:54:40.540]  conservatives saying all this is shocking this needs to be restored
[3:54:40.540 --> 3:54:45.660]  immediately where for free speech across the board if your YouTube channel if my
[3:54:45.660 --> 3:54:49.740]  YouTube channel got deleted these people wouldn't be defending your free speech
[3:54:49.740 --> 3:54:54.900]  they'd be celebrating it in fact they're the ones that lobby for big tech to
[3:54:54.900 --> 3:55:01.460]  censor conservatives the guy that runs this Navarra media released a video and
[3:55:01.460 --> 3:55:06.820]  its screenshot in this RT article time to ban Trump before he was banned by big
[3:55:06.820 --> 3:55:13.420]  tech Ash Sarkar who is part of this Navarra media said cancel culture is not
[3:55:13.420 --> 3:55:18.140]  okay not cancel culture it's about social justice one of the other guys
[3:55:18.140 --> 3:55:22.940]  involved in Navarra media which was banned for about two hours before it was
[3:55:22.940 --> 3:55:27.460]  immediately restored he said whether or not you agree with what we publish it
[3:55:27.460 --> 3:55:30.900]  shouldn't be of the whim of giant tech companies to delete us overnight with no
[3:55:30.900 --> 3:55:36.260]  explanation or what I was told YouTube's a private company it can do what it
[3:55:36.260 --> 3:55:40.580]  likes oh only when it applies to conservatives when it applies to left
[3:55:40.580 --> 3:55:46.420]  wing news outlets there's a bedlam as an outcry labor MPs immediately intervene
[3:55:46.420 --> 3:55:51.340]  it gets restored within two hours this is what the same guy who's part of this
[3:55:51.340 --> 3:55:56.420]  media outlet said previously back in June 2020 after having said that big tech
[3:55:56.420 --> 3:56:01.340]  shouldn't have the right to be platform people he said quote it's not censorship
[3:56:01.340 --> 3:56:05.540]  when a private company decides to remove you from its platform you don't have an
[3:56:05.540 --> 3:56:10.020]  inalienable right to a Twitter account so on the one hand he's saying big tech
[3:56:10.020 --> 3:56:13.020]  shouldn't have the right to be platform people then he's saying that private
[3:56:13.020 --> 3:56:16.460]  companies should have the right to be platform people isn't it interesting that
[3:56:16.460 --> 3:56:21.180]  those rules only apply to right wing conservative channels you expected the
[3:56:21.180 --> 3:56:25.940]  reaction from the left to get this channel restored almost immediately and
[3:56:25.940 --> 3:56:29.980]  it was which would never happen for anyone on the right but then you had all
[3:56:29.980 --> 3:56:34.700]  these right wingers these conservatives going to bat for them and saying oh my
[3:56:34.700 --> 3:56:41.060]  god this is horrendous why they were cheerlead until their last breath for
[3:56:41.060 --> 3:56:45.820]  you to be banned not only would they celebrate it they would lobby for it so
[3:56:45.820 --> 3:56:50.580]  why on earth would you go to bat for them another example of weakness and
[3:56:50.580 --> 3:56:56.980]  pathetic failure and losing mentality meanwhile climate change activists
[3:56:56.980 --> 3:57:00.580]  pushing establishment narrative wonder why they're not in prison well the
[3:57:00.580 --> 3:57:03.860]  answers in the headline isn't it climate change activists from extinction
[3:57:03.860 --> 3:57:06.860]  rebellion which is extinction establishment who are actually
[3:57:06.860 --> 3:57:10.100]  furthering the establishment narrative on climate change express shot that they
[3:57:10.100 --> 3:57:15.220]  weren't in prison despite blocking major roads causing major accidents gluing
[3:57:15.220 --> 3:57:19.140]  their faces to the tarmac the police treat them like they're giving them
[3:57:19.140 --> 3:57:24.540]  customer service the government pat them on the back the government enact all the
[3:57:24.540 --> 3:57:28.780]  policies that they're demanding they are the environmentalist ecomentalist
[3:57:28.780 --> 3:57:33.660]  shock troops for the government so it's no surprise that they don't get arrested
[3:57:33.660 --> 3:57:38.700]  they don't get put in prison and now they're openly expressing surprise about
[3:57:38.700 --> 3:57:43.180]  it as if you don't know why it is I'm gonna wrap it up warram next summit dot
[3:57:43.180 --> 3:57:49.540]  news keep it locked in I'm sitting the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda
[3:57:49.540 --> 3:57:53.900]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the
[3:57:53.900 --> 3:57:57.820]  foods it's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but
[3:57:57.820 --> 3:58:02.780]  because we're made the image of God the creator and we are powerful and the
[3:58:02.780 --> 3:58:07.660]  social engineers fear that so much so that's why I repeat that famous internet
[3:58:07.660 --> 3:58:13.620]  saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the
[3:58:13.620 --> 3:58:19.860]  propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all
[3:58:19.860 --> 3:58:23.260]  their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[3:58:23.260 --> 3:58:29.500]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on
[3:58:29.500 --> 3:58:33.380]  the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that
[3:58:33.380 --> 3:58:36.740]  everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever because even you don't
[3:58:36.740 --> 3:58:42.180]  believe in God what the globalist are manifesting setting up and we are
[3:58:42.180 --> 3:58:45.620]  opposing the one-world government and the mark of the beast they just announced
[3:58:45.620 --> 3:58:50.900]  if you think the tyranny and oppression we're living under now is bad wait till
[3:58:50.900 --> 3:58:55.620]  they've got their world ID and that's exactly what the covid passports are
[3:58:55.620 --> 3:59:00.500]  all about and cloth swab and the UN and all the other globalist leaders own
[3:59:00.500 --> 3:59:05.380]  words they admit that once they've gotten you with that system then they're
[3:59:05.380 --> 3:59:10.300]  gonna carbon tax you everywhere you go and track what you do and publicly
[3:59:10.300 --> 3:59:13.700]  they're saying they're gonna decide when you can travel and when you can't
[3:59:13.700 --> 3:59:18.060]  travel and mastercard and then all the other big companies are currently
[3:59:18.060 --> 3:59:22.220]  announcing they're gonna track what you do and where you go and tax you with a
[3:59:22.220 --> 3:59:27.660]  carbon tax for it this is the holy grail of tyranny ladies and gentlemen this is
[3:59:27.660 --> 3:59:31.780]  the takeover in humanity better wake up and say no finally folks are starting to
[3:59:31.780 --> 3:59:35.500]  wake up Joe Rogan Tucker Carlson others who leave the charts along with them for
[3:59:35.500 --> 3:59:40.060]  us but it's not enough every individual has to not comply we have to talk about
[3:59:40.060 --> 3:59:44.060]  bringing the globalist to justice you see they need the fear of God put in them
[3:59:44.060 --> 3:59:52.660]  legally and lawfully if you are receiving this transmission you are the
[3:59:52.660 --> 4:00:05.340]  resistance
