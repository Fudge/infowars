[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.680]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:22.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.880]  Welcome, my friends. Welcome. We are rapidly accelerating towards Turkey Day in this nation.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:52.360]  It is the 20th day of November, 2006. We'll be live for the next three hours on this Monday
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:01.960]  edition. And we have a lot of really important news to cover. We'll also have open phones.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.600]  High-level CIA, former CIA official, served as National Intelligence Officer and as Director
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.040]  of the CIA's Office of Regional and Political Analysis. He'll be joining us to talk about
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.480]  the inside job. We first interviewed him, the first to interview him, a few months ago
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.500]  when he went public. He'll be on to talk about 9-11 and his recent trip to Palestine, inside
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.720]  the Palestinian Authority, and what he witnessed there in the aftermath of the attack on Lebanon
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:46.000]  as well. So he's coming up. I almost ran off the road this morning. You know, every
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.200]  time I think that it can't get any crazier or more Orwellian or that Big Brother can't
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.720]  be more out in the open, I'm proven wrong. Now I, of course, as I heard it, I was shocked
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.040]  at first. And then I remembered, wait a minute, I saw this in the news five, six, seven years
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:14.920]  ago. Mothers Against Drunk Driving wants every car in the United States fitted with a breathalyzer.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:24.880]  And when you get in the car, it will automatically engage in an analysis of your emissions and
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.480]  of course report back via a cell phone GPS system that you're trying to drive while drinking.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.760]  They're not mentioning that in the press releases, but as I accessed my memory, I remembered
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:49.040]  that Toyota, Mercedes Benz, Honda, General Motors, they've all announced that there's
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.200]  not just going to be a breathalyzer in the car. There's going to be a package of surveillance
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.680]  devices. Now we've written articles about this years ago. I've got Paul Watson working
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.880]  on a big one right now. I don't want to just report on the Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.840]  I want to give you the big picture. But what's more important is I was listening to one of
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.960]  the talk show hosts on a station that carries my broadcast, Sergeant Sam, who over the years
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.720]  has gone from being a libertarian, I listened to the guy five years ago, he sounded okay,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.960]  to now sounding like a sheeple. And again, it's not attack of the body snatchers or the
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.920]  pod people, it's attack of the sheeple. And he was saying, this is wonderful, everyone
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.600]  needs to be forced to do this. The co-host said, well, but that's guilty until proven
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.240]  innocent. He said, fine, that's good. And there were police calling in going, yes, yes,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.240]  make everyone do it. So I called in and told him he was un-American. He got pretty upset
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:07.240]  about it. And there were these whiny women calling in. Well, I think if it saves someone,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.720]  we should do anything, anything to save them. Hey, lady, drunks kill, what is it, 40 something
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.720]  thousand people a year? That is a lot. But prescription drugs kill over 200,000. Malpractice
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.680]  kills over 300,000. But again, the media hasn't told you to be afraid of that or upset about
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.680]  that so you don't care. By the way, half of the DWIs in Travis County are illegal aliens.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.440]  In the Southwest, roughly half of them are. But there won't be talk about stopping the
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.720]  real problem. Well, no, no, no. They're going to make us all be little slaves. So I'll break
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.600]  down what's really going on with this on the other side. And if any of you whiny people
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.600]  want to call in, you're welcome to. We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.600]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.480]  Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.840]  orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.000]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.880]  were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.720]  us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.120]  police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.040]  guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.560]  crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get

[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:19.860]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:26.860]  All right, it is the 20th day of November 2006. It is a Monday edition. We do have
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:33.860]  the high-level CIA officer, former CIA officer, joining us coming up in the next hour. And
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:03.860]  also, we will cover some of the new things that are happening with Iraq. Bush and his
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:11.700]  Iraq Study Group coming out and saying exactly what we predicted they would say. That wasn't
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:19.400]  a very hard prediction to make. A lot of important information coming up on the broadcast. During
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:26.400]  the first segment, I mentioned the fact that Mothers Against Drunk Driving has come out
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.020]  with a new plan to force every car in the country, retroactively, we'll have to go pay
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:43.020]  to have it put in, to have a breathalyzer system built into it. And again, that's only
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.740]  part of a larger package of surveillance that all new cars will be equipped with. By the
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.520]  way, Mothers Against Drunk Driving is a complete front group. Six, seven years ago, we began
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.900]  covering out of industry publications the fact that infrared cameras will watch you
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:08.900]  in your car, live time, hooked into the police department. This is all official. GPS will
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:15.180]  track you down to three feet. Audio sensors will be in every car. And yes, there will
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:21.760]  also be a breathalyzer. Actually, when you hear it's a new, quote, ignition lock breathalyzer,
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.620]  they're selling you the system by just covering that one aspect. Toyota, Mercedes Benz and
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:34.620]  others are actually putting in surveillance blisters that are little combo arrays with
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.620]  all of this in them. In fact, there was a big article on it, how wonderful it all is
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.740]  and how we all need it, about five years ago in the Houston Chronicle. I remember that
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.780]  story. And they had said that in the next six to seven years, they were going to put
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:54.100]  this in all the cars. Well, they were five, six years later, and it's now beginning. But
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.740]  they can't just have the car companies announce that in a unified attack pattern, they're
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:06.260]  moving against us with the surveillance control tracking grid, taxation grid, control grid.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:13.260]  They have to have their front group of a bunch of emotional people running around whining.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:20.100]  And so Mothers Against Drunk Drivers is all over radio, all over TV, all over print, saying
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:27.100]  we need warrantless checkpoints everywhere, that we need all cars to have breathalyzers
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:34.100]  in them, and that basically America must out Orwell Orwell. Now, I'm not attacking Mothers
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.020]  Against Drunk Driving themselves. That is the individual members. The road to hell is
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.380]  paved with good intentions. But the leadership of it is clearly new world order and is always
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.260]  pushing for globalist agendas that won't just kill people on the roads, but will kill this
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:54.140]  country. And they know exactly what they're doing at the upper levels. And if any of those
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.380]  individuals want to call into this show, they're welcome. If you disagree with me on this subject,
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:06.380]  that's fine. But what really shocked me was to tune into local radio and hear the resonant
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:13.580]  cop on the show named Sergeant Sam saying, this is wonderful. And anyone who's against
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:20.260]  it is basically un-American. He then tried to liken the surveillance system to seatbelts.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:25.500]  Oh, well, everybody was against seatbelts, but we've got them now. And then I brought
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.380]  up the fact, well, first they had checkpoints. The police said, what do you have to hide?
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.700]  Now they're going to people's doors from Dallas to Tucson, Arizona, from Dallas, Texas to
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.140]  Tucson, Arizona. It's in the papers saying, hey, what do you have to hide? Let us search
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:44.540]  your house without a warrant. You know, when does it end? So it's pretty amazing. I want
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.260]  to go over these articles and let you know what it really means for society. I then brought
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:55.100]  up the fact that the Houston police chief wants cameras in every Houston home that was
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:01.500]  in the Houston Chronicle a few months ago, remember? Again, it's like the police chief
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.640]  of Bergen County, New Jersey. They have a police chief in the county, over two million
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.220]  people in his county saying, I'm going to force you to take a chip. I think you should
[00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.740]  be made to take a chip. See, that's how bizarre they are. Oh, we'll make you have a breathalyzer,
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.360]  guilty until proven innocent. We'll make you have cameras in your house. We'll make you
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:27.520]  take chips. And they get up on TV, they get up on radio and act like they're normal and
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:36.760]  we're bad. We're normal and they're bad, ladies and gentlemen. That's the reality. People
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:43.760]  don't want cameras in their houses. Should I have to even say that? So they're out there
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.040]  pushing the agenda that they're the majority and they're normal? No. But there are a lot
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.800]  of weak-minded people who tune into that and they hear that and they buy into it. By the
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.600]  way, I have a big article here with big newspapers across the country panicking that actual newspaper
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.040]  articles to be written in this country are going to be outsourced to India. Now, McDonald's
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.880]  and Burger King have announced, and they're doing this at stores all over the country
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.660]  now in pilot test, that when you go up to the window, it will be satelliteed over the
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:22.340]  digital phone lines to India. We always joked they would outsource the fast food. Well,
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:28.260]  it's now happening. And you will actually talk to someone in India. Well, now big papers
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:35.260]  coast to coast are outsourcing and they're going to use Indian writers in India using,
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:42.580]  I guess, Namda Gher or Pseudonyms. Folks, this is mainstream news today. And they're
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:50.420]  going to then, of course, write canned news and put it in your papers. You thought the
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:56.540]  newspapers were full of propaganda. And just to describe how my weird brain works, when
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:01.980]  I saw that story, a group of stories on it this morning, it's now being announced, and
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.880]  obviously the press is going to report on it. They're reporting on it in horror. When
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.940]  I saw that, I thought of a story in the Statesman yesterday and another story in the Dallas
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:16.100]  Morning News, because it's all propaganda, how everyone loves the toll roads and how
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.860]  much money they're bringing to Texas, the Spanish-owned, foreign-owned toll roads. And
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.260]  I thought, go ahead, reporters. Go ahead and tow the line. You're not going to have jobs
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:33.260]  very soon. You see, go ahead and serve the globalists. Go ahead and serve them in globalization.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:39.620]  I remember a few years ago, Dell computer workers, four or five years ago, who were
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.860]  millionaires. They'd gotten in early on the company, so they had stock, and so they were
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:50.860]  worth a million dollars or $600,000. And they'd say, oh, let them lay off the factory workers.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.700]  Oh, I love globalism. Oh, let them lay people off at the factories. Well, now they've even
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.380]  laid off their management jobs. And they're freaking out, and then they'll send me emails
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:08.380]  apologizing. So just go ahead. Enjoy your globalism. It's designed to destroy middle
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:15.140]  classes. It's designed to criminally consolidate wealth. It's designed to wreck our economies.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:21.820]  So go ahead and cheerleader for it. You're just training your replacements right now.
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:28.820]  Enjoy. Have riots over PlayStation 3s. Go into deeper debt to buy your child the brainwashing
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.660]  box. Just, just, again, don't listen to me. Take your mercury vaccines. Take all your
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:40.980]  prescription drugs. Let Google sit there and use the cameras and microphones on your computer
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:47.300]  to listen to you and watch you. Just wallow in it. Don't listen to me anymore. Just go
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.940]  along with it. Just enjoy.
