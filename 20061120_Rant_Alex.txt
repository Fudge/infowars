[00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:10.445]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:12.025]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:13.946]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:17.767]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:21.848]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.473 --> 00:00:37.515]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:43.860]  We are rapidly accelerating towards Turkey Day in this nation.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.444]  It is the 20th day of November 2006.
[00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:56.370]  We'll be live the next three hours on this Monday edition.
[00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.092]  And we have a lot of really important news to cover.
[00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:02.026]  We'll also have open phones.
[00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:14.172]  High-level CIA, former CIA official, served as National Intelligence Officer and as Director of the CIA's Office of Regional and Political Analysis.
[00:01:14.172 --> 00:01:16.213]  He'll be joining us to talk about 9-11, the inside job.
[00:01:18.624 --> 00:01:23.546]  We first interviewed him, the first to interview him, a few months ago when he went public.
[00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:39.050]  He'll be on to talk about 9-11 and his recent trip to Palestine inside the Palestinian Authority and what he witnessed there in the aftermath of the attack on Lebanon as well.
[00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.391]  So he's coming up.
[00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:44.612]  I almost ran off the road this morning
[00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:55.417]  You know, every time I think that it can't get any crazier or more Orwellian, or that Big Brother can't be more out in the open, I'm proven wrong.
[00:01:55.417 --> 00:02:06.083]  Now, I, of course, as I heard it, I was shocked at first, and then I remembered, wait a minute, I saw this in the news five, six, seven years ago.
[00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:13.247]  Mothers Against Drunk Driving wants every car in the United States fitted with a breathalyzer
[00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:33.378]  And when you get in the car, it will automatically engage in an analysis of your emissions, and of course, report back via a cell phone GPS system that you're trying to drive while drinking.
[00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:43.246]  They're not mentioning that in the press releases, but as I accessed my memory, I remembered that Toyota, Mercedes-Benz,
[00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:53.620]  Honda, General Motors, they've all announced that there's not just going to be a breathalyzer in the car.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.245]  There's going to be a package of surveillance devices.
[00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:02.567]  Now, we've written articles about this years ago.
[00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:05.009]  I've got Paul Watson working on a big one right now.
[00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.911]  I don't want to just report on the mothers against drunk driving.
[00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:09.112]  I want to give you the big picture.
[00:03:10.914 --> 00:03:30.643]  But what's more important is I was listening to one of the talk show hosts on a station that carries my broadcast, Sergeant Sam, who over the years has gone from being a libertarian, and I listened to the guy five years ago, he sounded okay, to now sounding like a sheeple.
[00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:35.725]  And again, it's not attack of the body snatchers or the pod people, it's attack of the sheeple.
[00:03:37.476 --> 00:03:41.617]  And he was saying, this is wonderful, everyone needs to be forced to do this.
[00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:45.998]  The co-host said, well, but that's guilty until proven innocent.
[00:03:45.998 --> 00:03:47.558]  He said, fine, that's good!
[00:03:47.558 --> 00:03:55.259]  And there were police calling in going, yes, yes, make everyone do it!
[00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.300]  So I called in and told him he was un-American.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.120]  He got pretty upset about it.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.441]  But that's what, and there were these whiny women calling in.
[00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:09.974]  Well, I think if it saves someone, we should do anything, anything to save them.
[00:04:09.974 --> 00:04:14.898]  Hey lady, drunks kill, what is it, 40-something thousand people a year?
[00:04:14.898 --> 00:04:16.819]  That is a lot.
[00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.922]  But prescription drugs kill over 200,000.
[00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:24.284]  Malpractice kills over 300,000.
[00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:29.547]  But again, the media hasn't told you to be afraid of that or upset about that, so you don't care.
[00:04:29.547 --> 00:04:31.509]  By the way, half of the DWI's
[00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.837]  in Travis County are illegal aliens.
[00:04:36.837 --> 00:04:41.199]  In the Southwest, roughly half of them are, but they won't be talking about stopping the real problem.
[00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.540]  Well, they're no, no, no.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.162]  They're going to make us all be little slaves.
[00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:52.165]  So I'll break down what's really going on with this on the other side.
[00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:55.046]  And if any of you whiny people want to call in, you're welcome to.
[00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:56.387]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:07.934]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.934 --> 00:05:10.255]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:17.898]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.033]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:37.757]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.757 --> 00:05:41.738]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.738 --> 00:05:43.999]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.840]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:30.326 --> 00:07:34.069]  Pretty salt lamps to ionize the air and reduce EMF radiation.

[00:08:10.562 --> 00:08:12.162]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.162 --> 00:08:13.702]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:17.904]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.904 --> 00:08:21.965]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:38.843 --> 00:08:41.584]  Alright, it is the 20th day of November 2006.
[00:08:41.584 --> 00:08:44.684]  It is a Monday edition.
[00:08:44.684 --> 00:08:58.947]  We do have the high-level CIA officer, former CIA officer, joining us, coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:58.947 --> 00:09:06.808]  Also, we will cover some of the new things that are happening with Iraq, Bush and his Iraq study group.
[00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:11.919]  Coming out and saying exactly what we predicted, they would say.
[00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:16.382]  That wasn't a very hard prediction to make.
[00:09:16.382 --> 00:09:21.465]  A lot of important information coming up on the broadcast.
[00:09:21.465 --> 00:09:36.813]  During the first segment, I mentioned the fact that Mothers Against Drunk Driving has come out with a new plan to force every car in the country, retroactively, we'll have to go pay to have it put in,
[00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:43.103]  To have a breathalyzer system built into it.
[00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:50.345]  And again, that's only part of a larger package of surveillance that all new cars will be equipped with.
[00:09:50.345 --> 00:09:54.927]  By the way, Mothers Against Drunk Driving is a complete front group.
[00:09:54.927 --> 00:10:06.571]  Six, seven years ago we began covering, out of industry publications, the fact that infrared cameras will watch you in your car, live time, hooked into the police department.
[00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:07.331]  This is all official.
[00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:11.090]  GPS will track you down to three feet.
[00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.035]  Audio sensors will be in every car.
[00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.887]  And yes, there will also be a breathalyzer.
[00:10:16.887 --> 00:10:26.153]  Actually, when you hear it's a new, quote, ignition lock breathalyzer, they're selling you the system by just covering that one aspect.
[00:10:26.153 --> 00:10:35.538]  Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and others are actually putting in surveillance blisters that are little combo arrays with all of this in them.
[00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:42.162]  In fact, there was a big article on it, how wonderful it all is and how we all need it, about five years ago in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:43.003]  I remember that story.
[00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:48.887]  And they had said that in the next six to seven years they were going to put this in all the cars.
[00:10:48.887 --> 00:10:53.989]  Well, we're five, six years later and it's now beginning.
[00:10:53.989 --> 00:11:06.572]  But they can't just have the car companies announce that in a unified pattern, in a unified attack pattern, they're moving against us with the surveillance control tracking grid, taxation grid, control grid.
[00:11:06.572 --> 00:11:06.952]  No, no, no.
[00:11:06.952 --> 00:11:11.993]  They have to have their front group of a bunch of emotional people running around whining.
[00:11:13.078 --> 00:11:31.438]  And so, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers is all over radio, all over TV, all over print, saying we need warrantless checkpoints everywhere, that we need all cars to have breathalyzers in them, and that basically America must out Orwell Orwell.
[00:11:33.047 --> 00:11:35.629]  I'm not attacking Mothers Against Drunk Driving themselves.
[00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:36.990]  That is the individual members.
[00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.152]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:11:39.152 --> 00:11:49.862]  But the leadership of it is clearly New World Order and is always pushing for globalist agendas that won't just kill people on the roads, but will kill this country.
[00:11:49.862 --> 00:11:52.744]  And they know exactly what they're doing at the upper levels.
[00:11:52.744 --> 00:11:53.545]  And if any of those
[00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.612]  Individuals want to call into the show, they're welcome.
[00:11:56.612 --> 00:12:00.434]  You know, if you disagree with me on this subject, that's fine.
[00:12:00.434 --> 00:12:16.504]  But what really shocked me was to tune into local radio and hear the resident cop on the show named Sergeant Sam saying, this is wonderful and anyone who's against it is basically un-American.
[00:12:16.504 --> 00:12:21.206]  He then tried to liken the surveillance system to seatbelts.
[00:12:21.206 --> 00:12:23.708]  Oh well, everybody was against seatbelts, but we've got them now.
[00:12:24.682 --> 00:12:29.325]  And then I brought up the fact, well, first they had checkpoints and the police said, what do you have to hide?
[00:12:29.325 --> 00:12:34.989]  Now they're going to people's doors from Dallas to Tucson, Arizona, from Dallas, Texas to Tucson, Arizona.
[00:12:34.989 --> 00:12:37.731]  It's in the papers saying, hey, what do you have to hide?
[00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:40.132]  Let us search your house without a warrant.
[00:12:40.132 --> 00:12:41.333]  You know, when does it end?
[00:12:43.217 --> 00:12:44.358]  So it's pretty amazing.
[00:12:44.358 --> 00:12:47.979]  I want to go over these articles and let you know what it really means for society.
[00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:58.505]  I then brought up the fact that the Houston police chief wants cameras in every Houston home that was in the Houston Chronicle a few months ago, remember?
[00:12:58.505 --> 00:13:03.247]  Again, that's... it's like the police chief of Bergen County, New Jersey.
[00:13:04.173 --> 00:13:09.755]  They have a police chief in the county, over two million people in his county, saying, I'm going to force you to take a chip.
[00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:11.536]  I think you should be made to take a chip.
[00:13:11.536 --> 00:13:13.937]  See, that's how bizarre they are.
[00:13:13.937 --> 00:13:15.717]  Oh, we'll make you have a breathalyzer.
[00:13:15.717 --> 00:13:17.438]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:13:17.438 --> 00:13:19.779]  We'll make you have cameras in your house.
[00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:21.119]  We'll make you take chips.
[00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:28.742]  And they get up on TV, they get up on radio, and act like they're normal and we're bad.
[00:13:30.288 --> 00:13:34.971]  We're normal, and they're bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:34.971 --> 00:13:36.452]  That's the reality.
[00:13:36.452 --> 00:13:38.594]  People don't want cameras in their houses.
[00:13:38.594 --> 00:13:43.157]  I mean, should I have to even say that?
[00:13:43.157 --> 00:13:47.400]  So they're out there pushing the agenda that they're the majority and they're normal.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.461]  No.
[00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:53.604]  But there are a lot of weak-minded people who tune into that, and they hear that, and they buy into it.
[00:13:53.604 --> 00:13:57.567]  By the way, I have a big article here with big newspapers across the country panicking
[00:13:58.266 --> 00:14:04.110]  That actual newspaper articles to be written in this country are going to be outsourced to India.
[00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:19.419]  Now McDonald's and Burger King have announced, and they're doing this at stores all over the country now in pilot test, that when you go up to the window, it will be satellited over the phone lines, over the digital phone lines, to India.
[00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:21.961]  We always joked that they would outsource the fast food.
[00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:23.502]  Well, it's now happening.
[00:14:23.502 --> 00:14:25.483]  And you will actually talk to someone in India.
[00:14:26.545 --> 00:14:39.254]  Well now, big papers coast to coast are outsourcing and they're going to use Indian writers in India using, I guess, nom de guerre or pseudonyms.
[00:14:40.097 --> 00:14:49.646]  Folks, this is mainstream news today, and they're going to then, of course, write canned news and put it in your papers.
[00:14:49.646 --> 00:14:53.570]  You thought the newspapers were full of propaganda!
[00:14:53.570 --> 00:15:04.600]  And just to describe how my weird brain works, when I saw that story, a group of stories on it this morning, because it's now being announced, and obviously the press is going to report on it, they're reporting on it in horror,
[00:15:06.778 --> 00:15:20.765]  When I saw that, I thought of a story in the Statesman yesterday and another story in the Dallas Morning News, because it's all propaganda, how everyone loves the toll roads and how much money they're bringing to Texas, the Spanish-owned, foreign-owned toll roads.
[00:15:20.765 --> 00:15:23.426]  And I thought, go ahead, reporters.
[00:15:23.426 --> 00:15:25.087]  Go ahead and tow the line.
[00:15:25.087 --> 00:15:26.888]  You're not going to have jobs very soon.
[00:15:28.268 --> 00:15:31.351]  You see, go ahead and serve the globalists.
[00:15:31.351 --> 00:15:33.573]  Go ahead and serve them in globalization.
[00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:37.997]  I remember a few years ago, Dell computer workers, four or five years ago,
[00:15:38.863 --> 00:15:51.772]  Who were delionaires, you know, they'd gotten in early on the company, so they had stock, and so they were worth a million dollars, or six hundred thousand dollars, and they'd say, oh, let them lay off the factory workers.
[00:15:51.772 --> 00:15:54.114]  Oh, I love globalism.
[00:15:54.114 --> 00:15:56.115]  Oh, let them lay people off at the factories.
[00:15:56.115 --> 00:16:02.740]  Well, now they've even laid off their management jobs, and they're freaking out, and they'll send me emails apologizing.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.503]  So just go ahead, enjoy your globalism.
[00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:09.384]  It's designed to destroy middle classes.
[00:16:09.384 --> 00:16:12.525]  It's designed to criminally consolidate wealth.
[00:16:12.525 --> 00:16:15.045]  It's designed to wreck our economies.
[00:16:15.045 --> 00:16:17.266]  So go ahead and cheerleader for it.
[00:16:17.266 --> 00:16:21.587]  You're just training your replacements right now.
[00:16:21.587 --> 00:16:22.987]  Enjoy!
[00:16:22.987 --> 00:16:25.808]  Have riots over PlayStation 3s.
[00:16:25.808 --> 00:16:28.969]  Go into deeper debt to buy your child the brainwashing box.
[00:16:29.733 --> 00:16:32.015]  Just, just, again, don't listen to me.
[00:16:32.015 --> 00:16:34.157]  Take your mercury vaccines.
[00:16:34.157 --> 00:16:36.479]  Take all your prescription drugs.
[00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:42.845]  You know, let Google sit there and use the cameras and microphones on your computer to listen to you and watch you.
[00:16:42.845 --> 00:16:44.686]  Just, just, just wallow in it.
[00:16:44.686 --> 00:16:46.968]  Don't, don't listen to me anymore.
[00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:48.410]  Just go along with it.
[00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.611]  Just enjoy.
