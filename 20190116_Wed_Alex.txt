[00:00.000 --> 00:19.160]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info
[00:19.160 --> 00:32.320]  If you want to glimpse into what the left hopes spring to the United States, look no
[00:32.320 --> 00:37.880]  further than Communist China, where political dissidents are now being arrested and interrogated
[00:37.880 --> 00:39.920]  for what they put on Twitter.
[00:39.920 --> 00:45.840]  Sounds familiar, right?
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.800]  Over the past few years, the tolerant left has become increasingly intolerant of speech
[00:50.800 --> 00:51.800]  they disagree with.
[00:51.800 --> 00:56.640]  Calls to ban what they deem to be hate speech have only been intensified, and social media
[00:56.640 --> 01:01.800]  websites terms of agreement have become that of a Soviet concentration camp.
[01:01.800 --> 01:02.800]  Don't believe me?
[01:02.800 --> 01:08.000]  Just ask voices like Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, or Laura Loomer have all been banned from
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.640]  various social media platforms for standing up to the Washington establishment.
[01:12.640 --> 01:16.680]  To the left, censoring right-wing voices on social media isn't far enough.
[01:16.680 --> 01:20.080]  They seek the demise and total eradication of the First Amendment.
[01:20.080 --> 01:25.360]  I think it's super important here to carve out a section for hate speech, which naturally
[01:25.360 --> 01:26.360]  shouldn't be allowed.
[01:26.360 --> 01:31.480]  Their end goal is for Twitter's terms of services to become the law here in this country.
[01:31.480 --> 01:34.400]  In China, this is quite literally the case.
[01:34.400 --> 01:43.120]  Ironically, using Twitter in China will put your entire life at risk.
[01:43.120 --> 01:47.920]  According to the New York Times, one man spent 15 days in a detention center.
[01:47.920 --> 01:52.920]  The police threatened another's family, and a third was chained to a chair for eight hours
[01:52.920 --> 01:53.920]  of interrogation.
[01:53.920 --> 01:55.920]  There are offense?
[01:55.920 --> 02:00.160]  Posting on Twitter, the New York Times article goes on to say, the Chinese government has
[02:00.160 --> 02:05.560]  increasingly demanded that both Google and Facebook take down content that officials
[02:05.560 --> 02:09.880]  object to, even though both company sites are inaccessible in China.
[02:09.880 --> 02:14.760]  They then cite one example where a user had his Facebook and Twitter accounts suspended
[02:14.760 --> 02:18.920]  after criticizing the Chinese government, suggesting that the tech giants are complicit
[02:18.920 --> 02:28.560]  in silencing dissent to the communist regime.
[02:28.560 --> 02:33.720]  Despite the social media platform being banned, there are an estimated 3.2 million Twitter
[02:33.720 --> 02:35.280]  users in China.
[02:35.280 --> 02:38.560]  This amounts to 0.4% of internet users in China.
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.160]  The reason China is so opposed to social media is the same reason why Alex Jones was banned
[02:43.160 --> 02:46.240]  from virtually every platform here in the United States.
[02:46.240 --> 02:52.080]  Big government socialists want no opposition, no competition to their ideas, and no questions
[02:52.080 --> 02:53.080]  asked.
[02:53.080 --> 02:57.880]  They want to maintain a narrative that socialism is all butterflies and rainbows, and fear
[02:57.880 --> 03:01.600]  the truth leaking out.
[03:01.600 --> 03:08.400]  In fact, it's been reported that the police in China will print out people's tweets,
[03:08.400 --> 03:19.520]  critical of the government, and demand that they take them down.
[03:19.520 --> 03:25.040]  One man was interrogated for 20 hours, and sent to a re-education camp for two weeks
[03:25.040 --> 03:26.880]  for his anti-government tweets.
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.400]  Some human rights activists in China told the New York Times we've been living a very
[03:31.400 --> 03:32.400]  suppressed life.
[03:32.400 --> 03:38.640]  The activist was also quoted as saying, we're like lambs, they're taking us one after another.
[03:38.640 --> 03:40.520]  We have no ability to fight back.
[03:40.520 --> 03:45.200]  I hope this is a wake-up call to all right-wingers that this is what we're up against in the
[03:45.200 --> 03:46.200]  United States.
[03:46.200 --> 03:49.760]  There is no doubt that these are the policies the left hopes to implement.
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.200]  They hate free speech.
[03:51.200 --> 03:55.520]  They hate alternative viewpoints, and they seek punishment for those who won't submit
[03:55.520 --> 03:57.120]  to their left-wing programming.
[03:57.120 --> 03:58.520]  Orange man bad.
[03:58.520 --> 03:59.520]  Orange man.
[03:59.520 --> 04:00.520]  Orange man.
[04:00.520 --> 04:01.520]  Orange man.
[04:01.520 --> 04:02.520]  Orange man.
[04:02.520 --> 04:08.520]  In fact, in some states like New York, similar legislation is already being explored.
[04:08.520 --> 04:13.160]  Democrats in the state want you to turn over your social media passwords to the government,
[04:13.160 --> 04:17.520]  so they can comb through your profiles before allowing you to purchase a firearm.
[04:17.520 --> 04:21.840]  Imagine needing to forfeit over your social media accounts to the government to exercise
[04:21.840 --> 04:25.560]  one of your most basic civil rights, complete lunacy.
[04:25.560 --> 04:29.760]  These draconian laws are already bleeding their way into our country, and if we don't
[04:29.760 --> 04:35.040]  act now, it won't be long until America, as we know it, is gone and indistinguishable
[04:35.040 --> 04:36.920]  from communist China.
[04:36.920 --> 04:48.680]  Stand up now, or forever be silenced.
[04:48.680 --> 05:00.480]  Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[05:00.480 --> 05:04.320]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[05:04.320 --> 05:08.840]  The real drama can be found here in Lelani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[05:08.840 --> 05:14.280]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[05:14.280 --> 05:19.680]  Like ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[05:19.680 --> 05:21.200]  to unhealthy levels.
[05:21.200 --> 05:27.720]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[05:27.720 --> 05:31.720]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[05:31.720 --> 05:33.040]  in the rainwater.
[05:33.040 --> 05:38.120]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the
[05:38.120 --> 05:44.120]  heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[05:44.120 --> 05:50.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[05:50.160 --> 05:55.480]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[05:55.480 --> 06:10.040]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[06:10.040 --> 06:30.000]  Using up-frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.000 --> 06:38.520]  I have had an extreme epiphany this morning, an extreme epiphany.
[06:38.520 --> 06:46.440]  In fact, I have the key to defeating the globalist.
[06:46.440 --> 06:47.440]  The key.
[06:47.440 --> 06:55.200]  And I'm going to get into it in the next segment.
[06:55.200 --> 07:22.880]  But first, an important prelude to that is Sean Hannity, a key to that is a prelude
[07:22.880 --> 07:36.360]  with Sean Hannity talking about the fact that this country is under an active coup against
[07:36.360 --> 07:37.360]  the president.
[07:37.360 --> 07:46.600]  Now, you have to understand that Sean Hannity is being told he's going to be fired, and
[07:46.600 --> 07:47.600]  he said, fine, fire me.
[07:47.600 --> 07:50.760]  I don't have that from Sean Hannity, I have it from people that have been in the room
[07:50.760 --> 07:53.200]  repeatedly, and I'm relieved with that.
[07:53.200 --> 07:57.720]  So that's how close this country is, not even having Sean Hannity on air.
[07:57.720 --> 08:01.560]  For telling the truth, because what you're about to hear him say, his monologues posted
[08:01.560 --> 08:07.880]  infowars.com, is the truth.
[08:07.880 --> 08:11.760]  That's how dire the strates are, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:11.760 --> 08:16.680]  All right, here's the report.
[08:16.680 --> 08:23.800]  We now know top people within the FBI filled with hatred and, frankly, anti-Trump rage
[08:23.800 --> 08:30.560]  have put us all at all values, and their blatant political bias were seeking redemption
[08:30.560 --> 08:32.400]  for the firing of James Comey.
[08:32.400 --> 08:38.280]  They actually plotted to destroy your duly elected president, and this goes way beyond
[08:38.280 --> 08:40.280]  what we already knew up until this point.
[08:40.280 --> 08:44.960]  Now, according to this report, Friday, New York Times, as usual, anonymous sources.
[08:44.960 --> 08:51.400]  Two days after Comey was unceremoniously terminated, several top FBI officials actually questioned
[08:51.400 --> 08:54.800]  whether or not President Trump was working directly for Russia.
[08:54.800 --> 09:02.960]  Now, they did this without a single shred of evidence, zero probable cause, zero proof
[09:02.960 --> 09:04.760]  of any collusion.
[09:04.760 --> 09:05.760]  It was a witch hunt.
[09:05.760 --> 09:07.680]  The president's been right from day one.
[09:07.680 --> 09:12.840]  They opened an investigation into whether or not Russia directed the president to fire
[09:12.840 --> 09:15.720]  their beloved Trump-hater, James Comey.
[09:15.720 --> 09:20.400]  This despite Comey's testimony, that there was no evidence of collusion.
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.240]  For nine months, they had been looking into this, and that Trump was not the target of
[09:25.240 --> 09:26.240]  his investigation.
[09:26.240 --> 09:31.160]  Remember, even Comey, the Trump-hater that he is, admitted that the president could
[09:31.160 --> 09:33.320]  fire him for any reason.
[09:33.320 --> 09:35.320]  Nobody in the media seems to want to tell you that.
[09:35.320 --> 09:40.720]  Now, Congressman John Ratcliffe told our own Catherine Harridge, quote, in May of 2017,
[09:40.720 --> 09:47.840]  how bias-infected senior FBI leadership and emotion, not evidence, drove their decision-making.
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.960]  Now, his closed-door interview with the former FBI counsel, James Baker, revealed this.
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.440]  This is important, quote, FBI senior leadership could not accept that Comey was fired for
[09:58.440 --> 10:04.360]  cause and the president had the constitutional authority to terminate Comey.
[10:04.360 --> 10:07.760]  So they begin the witch hunt, which had already started nine months earlier.
[10:07.760 --> 10:14.360]  Now, President Trump's former attorney, John Dowd, has called the FBI's anti-Trump operations
[10:14.360 --> 10:16.720]  a political coup.
[10:16.720 --> 10:17.720]  Watch this.
[10:17.720 --> 10:23.800]  Little did I know that it appears that they were all in it together.
[10:23.800 --> 10:31.200]  I mean, Rodolstein, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, the whole crowd, and that they were out to
[10:31.200 --> 10:33.360]  get this president no matter what.
[10:33.360 --> 10:36.240]  I don't think they sincerely believed anything about Russia.
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.320]  This is our worst nightmare that someone with that kind of power would then decide to go
[10:42.320 --> 10:43.320]  after the president.
[10:43.320 --> 10:44.320]  I mean, it's a coup.
[10:44.320 --> 10:51.920]  That's why it's an attempted coup by Comey and his crowd, and the evidence is all there.
[10:51.920 --> 10:58.360]  I take the New York Times article as an admission of their bad behavior.
[10:58.360 --> 11:04.040]  Admission of corruption and abuse of power by people that are unchecked of bureaucracy
[11:04.040 --> 11:08.440]  unto itself, unlimited powers, no accountability.
[11:08.440 --> 11:10.200]  Is any of this good for America?
[11:10.200 --> 11:14.920]  Did these deep state officials that we have been just uncovering now for nearly two years,
[11:14.920 --> 11:19.240]  did they do anything other, these top officials, than hate the president?
[11:19.240 --> 11:20.640]  And are you really surprised?
[11:20.640 --> 11:23.760]  Remember, these are the same bureaucrats.
[11:23.760 --> 11:26.800]  They openly rooted for Hillary Clinton to win the election.
[11:26.800 --> 11:31.120]  Peter Strzok texting that Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero.
[11:31.120 --> 11:33.320]  And of course, that all those horrible things about the president.
[11:33.320 --> 11:40.400]  The same officials who wrote an exoneration in May of 2016, months before actually interviewing
[11:40.400 --> 11:45.240]  Hillary and 16 other witnesses in July before they exonerated her.
[11:45.240 --> 11:48.800]  It was already written the exoneration before the investigation.
[11:48.800 --> 11:50.480]  The same people that yawned.
[11:50.480 --> 11:53.160]  We know it is incontrovertible.
[11:53.160 --> 11:55.920]  Hillary Clinton obstructed justice.
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.440]  She destroyed subpoenaed emails, 33,000 of them.
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.920]  Cashed her hard drive with bleach-fit, smashing smartphones and iPhones with a hammer and
[12:05.920 --> 12:07.640]  taking away SIM cards.
[12:07.640 --> 12:13.200]  The same people who looked the other way when Hillary and the DNC funneled money through
[12:13.200 --> 12:19.680]  Perkins Cooley, a law firm, a campaign finance violation, to hire an research firm, to hire
[12:19.680 --> 12:24.240]  oh, Christopher Steele, a foreign national, to give us Russian lies.
[12:24.240 --> 12:30.320]  The same bureaucrats who all but applauded when Clinton's funneled cash used to hire
[12:30.320 --> 12:32.240]  Christopher Steele, why?
[12:32.240 --> 12:39.160]  To produce a dossier that we now know were full of lies, misinformation, propaganda about
[12:39.160 --> 12:43.480]  President Trump, which we now know today are debunked.
[12:43.480 --> 12:49.560]  The same people who helped disseminate those Russian lies that she paid for to you, the
[12:49.560 --> 12:54.400]  American people, and throughout the highest levels of our government doing that before
[12:54.400 --> 13:01.200]  an election, so-called trusted officials who used the dossier to defraud a Pfizer court
[13:01.200 --> 13:07.080]  multiple times to spy on a Trump campaign associate, by the way, fraud before the court.
[13:07.080 --> 13:12.160]  The same people who used that dossier to open up an investigation into Trump.
[13:12.160 --> 13:18.560]  This all has happened, and yeah, a baseless investigation into a president being controlled
[13:18.560 --> 13:21.560]  by Russia is now just par for the course.
[13:21.560 --> 13:23.840]  And the hysteria, the media is even worse.
[13:23.840 --> 13:29.160]  Remember, this was nine months after they already been investigating so-called collusion.
[13:29.160 --> 13:34.960]  And by nine months, period of time, Lisa Page, Peter Struck, James Comey, Andrew McCabe,
[13:34.960 --> 13:37.880]  all hate Trump, all said they had nothing.
[13:37.880 --> 13:42.080]  Former Clinton pollster Mark Penn, who recently wrote an op-ed, he points out the blatant
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.280]  unequal justice under the law, quote, somehow every clear security breach in the Clinton
[13:47.280 --> 13:52.320]  camp was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be
[13:52.320 --> 13:57.360]  linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.
[13:57.360 --> 14:02.240]  Now a former assistant director of intelligence at the FBI is rightly calling out his old
[14:02.240 --> 14:06.160]  colleagues for this massive abuse of power.
[14:06.160 --> 14:07.160]  Take a look.
[14:07.160 --> 14:13.640]  Are we criminalizing, or are we exercising the authorities, the legitimate authorities
[14:13.640 --> 14:20.720]  of the FBI to investigate policy differences, to investigate foreign policy stances by an
[14:20.720 --> 14:21.720]  administration?
[14:21.720 --> 14:23.880]  Well, that's not the role of the FBI.
[14:23.880 --> 14:25.320]  No, it's not.
[14:25.320 --> 14:29.040]  And despite everything we just showed you, the special counsel investigation rolls on.
[14:29.040 --> 14:34.040]  They're not looking into Hillary Clinton, or phony Russian dossier that she paid for.
[14:34.040 --> 14:38.640]  Their focus is singularly on President Trump and everyone around him.
[14:38.640 --> 14:43.960]  However, tonight, at least one so-called journalist from the hate Trump media is trying to play
[14:43.960 --> 14:49.040]  down expectations, where people are hyping up every second, every minute, every hour
[14:49.040 --> 14:53.240]  of every day about Trump and Russia, and about the Mueller report.
[14:53.240 --> 14:54.960]  Take a look.
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.920]  What I am getting is that this is all building up to the Mueller report and raising expectations
[15:00.920 --> 15:04.760]  of a bombshell report, and there have been expectations that have been building, of course,
[15:04.760 --> 15:06.360]  for over a year on this.
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.880]  But people who are closest to what Mueller has been doing, have interacted with the special
[15:10.880 --> 15:15.360]  counsel, cautioned me that this report is almost certain to be anti-climatic.
[15:15.360 --> 15:16.360]  Anti-climatic.
[15:16.360 --> 15:20.000]  Honestly, I don't trust what you just heard.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.240]  Given the overwhelming partisan makeup of Mueller's team and their behavior throughout
[15:24.240 --> 15:30.800]  this process, consisting of high-powered Democratic donors and attorneys, mark my words, they
[15:30.800 --> 15:34.680]  have and will continue to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump.
[15:34.680 --> 15:36.680]  They've been doing it now for two.
[15:36.680 --> 15:39.160]  He goes on to say he believes they're going to have a fake bombshell.
[15:39.160 --> 15:43.080]  This is a criminal coup of rogue government.
[15:43.080 --> 15:44.080]  This is really happening.
[15:44.080 --> 15:49.680]  This is a rogue power unto itself, criminals that covered up for the Clintons and are on
[15:49.680 --> 15:50.880]  the Russian payroll.
[15:50.880 --> 15:52.080]  That's why they're so scared.
[15:52.080 --> 15:59.280]  Mueller, all of them, are literal Russian agents.
[15:59.280 --> 16:04.680]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[16:04.680 --> 16:05.680]  the world.
[16:05.680 --> 16:08.680]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[16:08.680 --> 16:14.640]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[16:14.640 --> 16:18.440]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.

[16:19.440 --> 16:21.000]  Who do we fight for?

[18:00.320 --> 18:05.720]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.720 --> 18:10.960]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:10.960 --> 18:17.720]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:26.360]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.360 --> 18:31.840]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[18:31.840 --> 18:38.240]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:38.240 --> 18:41.800]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.800 --> 18:46.520]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.520 --> 18:52.320]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.320 --> 18:55.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.360]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:03.480 --> 20:22.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.080 --> 20:27.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[20:27.000 --> 20:52.480]  This is Alex Jones.
[20:52.480 --> 21:10.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones and we are here on the verge of really
[21:10.520 --> 21:15.240]  trying to choose what our future destiny is going to be.
[21:15.240 --> 21:16.840]  That's obviously an understatement.
[21:16.840 --> 21:20.280]  So earlier I said that I've had an epiphany.
[21:20.280 --> 21:27.240]  Now you should take all that knowledge in that epiphany and realize that an epiphany
[21:27.240 --> 21:32.440]  is a lot of things you already knew but when all the different pieces come together and
[21:32.440 --> 21:38.680]  you know you're right from past experience with previous epiphanies you've had, you know
[21:38.680 --> 21:43.240]  you have lightning in a bottle, you know you have Promethean fire, you know you have the
[21:43.240 --> 21:46.960]  way to defeat the enemy.
[21:46.960 --> 21:53.080]  I have been so focused on trying to defeat the globalists that I even dream at night
[21:53.080 --> 22:00.080]  now basically every night where I am working and studying and researching and it's real
[22:00.080 --> 22:04.680]  video clips, real history, real analysis and having the pieces come together.
[22:04.680 --> 22:11.400]  Now obviously something like that is hard to articulate because you'll only get pieces
[22:11.400 --> 22:14.440]  of it and not the real nuance.
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.760]  It's like time to describe the Grand Canyon to somebody that's never been there in person.
[22:19.760 --> 22:25.800]  You see photos, it looks big, it looks interesting but when you stand there and you're looking
[22:25.800 --> 22:33.640]  10 miles across to the other side and an eagle flies by and there's crisp wind, cold wind
[22:33.640 --> 22:38.960]  in your face and snow falling, it's totally different.
[22:38.960 --> 22:43.000]  The real thing versus photos.
[22:43.000 --> 22:49.440]  Well, it's the same thing here but let me try to quantify this as best I can.
[22:49.440 --> 23:00.920]  The epiphany came and this is a doorway into the crystallization.
[23:00.920 --> 23:06.600]  When I was up here at about 11 o'clock at night with Rob Dew and Zimmerman and Daria
[23:06.600 --> 23:15.760]  and others and I was going to shoot a response to Roku banning us and I was reading over
[23:15.760 --> 23:26.040]  all the news, I had about a dozen articles or 15 articles or so and I pulled back and
[23:26.040 --> 23:36.520]  I had the epiphany or the beginning of it and I said let's just go home.
[23:36.520 --> 23:41.880]  Because they're not going to even pick up what I say anyways.
[23:41.880 --> 23:49.040]  And just be calm about it and really get the gist of what is the story.
[23:49.040 --> 23:54.040]  It's not that I got taken off the hundredth and something platform, it's not that it's
[23:54.040 --> 23:58.880]  a beta test to take everybody else down, that was important.
[23:58.880 --> 24:06.840]  But it was reading what the Democrats and what the lawyers said feverishly, breathlessly
[24:06.840 --> 24:12.800]  in the Washington Post, the New York Times and everywhere, all in lockstep, speaking
[24:12.800 --> 24:13.800]  for the families.
[24:13.800 --> 24:17.600]  And when the families go on radio and TV, they say it too, the exact same words, exact
[24:17.600 --> 24:30.280]  same order, it was that I knew I questioned Sandy Hook from a place of historically understanding
[24:30.280 --> 24:33.760]  things can be staged and I have a right to do that.
[24:33.760 --> 24:39.320]  But it was the way that they then built it up into a straw man and built it up into this
[24:39.320 --> 24:43.080]  tight cast identity of who I was and was a very small part of what we ever covered.
[24:43.080 --> 24:50.360]  I didn't originate it, questioning it, I looked at both sides throughout the years, within
[24:50.360 --> 24:54.400]  a few years after it, this is like eight years ago, I said, I'm sick of people talking about
[24:54.400 --> 24:58.840]  this, this is not who I am, I know mass shootings happen because they were already trying to
[24:58.840 --> 25:03.000]  make it my identity and say that I just said it to be mean or to get attention.
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.320]  You say stuff like that, you get taken off the air, you don't get rich from it saying
[25:08.320 --> 25:09.800]  9-11's an inside job.
[25:09.800 --> 25:16.280]  I lost almost all my radio stations in 2001, I was exploding then.
[25:16.280 --> 25:21.560]  Absolutely like wildfire, over 120 something stations, 130 stations, not even like 150
[25:21.560 --> 25:26.360]  and I went down to 30 something stations within too much.
[25:26.360 --> 25:30.280]  Was I doing that because I was going to get rich off saying it was an inside job?
[25:30.280 --> 25:34.800]  I saw CBS when they said they blew up Building 7, I didn't know what happened but later they
[25:34.800 --> 25:37.920]  said it never happened and later we got the footage, years later the archives were put
[25:37.920 --> 25:40.640]  up and see it in.
[25:40.640 --> 25:45.520]  I was in the car to get a pizza and heard CBS radio again, back when they had that,
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.240]  saying they blew up Building 7 with bombs to protect the other buildings.
[25:49.240 --> 25:59.960]  Oh, but the lawyers say, I did all this to get rich but the epiphany was I was projecting
[25:59.960 --> 26:05.840]  my humanity onto the lawyers and onto the system and the Democrats thinking maybe they
[26:05.840 --> 26:11.520]  actually believe I'm a mean guy or something but then it all clicked.
[26:11.520 --> 26:15.520]  They all know I've said don't go to these people's houses and never did.
[26:15.520 --> 26:25.200]  They all know that I've reached out and told the truth and so they're the ones putting
[26:25.200 --> 26:32.120]  it out and saying nobody died through my mouth, through my voice and they're the ones saying
[26:32.120 --> 26:34.840]  go to people's houses and investigate.
[26:34.840 --> 26:40.280]  They just won't let it go away and that's only a window into the epiphany.
[26:40.280 --> 26:49.800]  It was the realization that I was being a real person and I felt bad not just that they
[26:49.800 --> 26:54.760]  were projecting onto me something I hadn't done and twisting it but I was still feeling
[26:54.760 --> 27:04.480]  guilt and last night and this morning all the guilt just lifted off of me and it's like
[27:04.480 --> 27:10.240]  I've hit this giant second wind now and I'm blessed, I love God, I want to tell the truth
[27:10.240 --> 27:13.840]  and God has put me in this position and all of us in this position to go through this
[27:13.840 --> 27:21.000]  persecution and out of this a great truth is going to come forward because I genuinely
[27:21.000 --> 27:28.320]  questioned Sandy Hook and people come up to me everywhere on the street, black, white,
[27:28.320 --> 27:31.760]  old, young, liberal and they go hey man you shouldn't have gone back on that something's
[27:31.760 --> 27:38.320]  wrong, something's you know and I'm just like listen, if I can't say somebody's 100% guilty
[27:38.320 --> 27:40.080]  of something I'm not going to say it.
[27:40.080 --> 27:43.960]  We have a right to question things because throughout history we've seen a lot of dirty
[27:43.960 --> 27:51.360]  stuff and a lot of stage things but the way God's plans work, the epiphany is I saw just
[27:51.360 --> 27:59.680]  an edge just a little bit of God like you see in your child's eyes, I saw God's plan
[27:59.680 --> 28:07.240]  and God said you watch this is going to be really rough son but you were all God's children,
[28:07.240 --> 28:13.920]  you're going to go through this and you're going to be stronger and it's happened before
[28:13.920 --> 28:22.080]  but not at this level and then it was just like next level understanding, it's amazing
[28:22.080 --> 28:26.640]  and I'm very, very blessed, it's rough, it's hard and it's hard for you to defend me but
[28:26.640 --> 28:33.120]  this is going to be a big test and the Lord works in mysterious ways and the epiphany
[28:33.120 --> 28:38.120]  was these globalists are just as cold-blooded and evil as we thought and we're just going
[28:38.120 --> 28:45.960]  to have to take them on and deal with them because there's no other way and that's it.
[28:45.960 --> 28:54.240]  The epiphany is much more deep than that obviously but this is a blessing, this is a blessing,
[28:54.240 --> 28:59.240]  this challenge to fight this level of deception, I'm very honored.
[28:59.240 --> 29:01.760]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?

[29:04.320 --> 29:08.520]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out
[29:08.520 --> 29:09.600]  of control.
[29:09.600 --> 29:14.960]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and
[29:14.960 --> 29:16.800]  using prescription drugs.
[29:16.800 --> 29:21.080]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from
[29:21.080 --> 29:22.080]  me.
[29:22.080 --> 29:25.080]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[29:25.080 --> 29:28.640]  I thought I could quit on my own but I couldn't.
[29:28.640 --> 29:31.320]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[31:04.520 --> 31:09.240]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[31:09.240 --> 31:10.760]  to detoxify the body.
[31:10.760 --> 31:15.640]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.

[31:22.080 --> 31:23.920]  the body and it supports the infomer.
[31:23.920 --> 31:26.160]  It is a classical 360 win.
[31:26.160 --> 31:30.680]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[31:30.680 --> 31:35.320]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[31:35.320 --> 31:36.320]  get.

[33:34.320 --> 34:02.440]  We are back.
[34:02.440 --> 34:03.440]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[34:03.440 --> 34:04.440]  Thank you for joining us.
[34:04.440 --> 34:07.920]  We are the most censored, most lied about, most demonized broadcast in the world.
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.280]  And if you study that, you'll understand how to defeat the globalist.
[34:11.280 --> 34:14.200]  I certainly have learned a lot going through this process.
[34:14.200 --> 34:18.160]  It's really been a blessing and I thank God for being put in this position.
[34:18.160 --> 34:22.040]  I've prayed many times to be able to take on the globalists and reignite Renaissance
[34:22.040 --> 34:26.200]  worldwide and basically relaunch populism and nationalism.
[34:26.200 --> 34:32.200]  And I know that Infowars and our audience of activists are the detonator that has swept
[34:32.200 --> 34:36.880]  this movement to worldwide prominence and soon dominance.
[34:36.880 --> 34:42.840]  And that is why they're attempting to destroy the original progenitors of this current mass
[34:42.840 --> 34:44.240]  wave of awakening.
[34:44.240 --> 34:47.200]  And we've got two special guests we're about to go to right now.
[34:47.200 --> 34:48.720]  One of them is Jack Pesovic.
[34:48.720 --> 34:52.520]  But there was a point I've been wanting to make about Sandy Hook forever that I haven't
[34:52.520 --> 34:55.120]  made and really a statement on it.
[34:55.120 --> 34:58.840]  And I'm going to do that when we start the next hour.
[34:58.840 --> 35:07.760]  Because this whole Roku situation, which I guess means six in Japanese, is a window into
[35:07.760 --> 35:10.600]  how they're going to take everybody off the year when they're done.
[35:10.600 --> 35:12.760]  And I mean basically even their liberal competition.
[35:12.760 --> 35:15.240]  This is authoritarianism.
[35:15.240 --> 35:21.200]  Once censorship starts, it always consolidates into one movie company, one theater company,
[35:21.200 --> 35:26.080]  one advertising company, and then very limited spots, total stagnation of culture.
[35:26.080 --> 35:27.280]  So that's where this is going.
[35:27.280 --> 35:34.120]  But you notice out of all the Sandy Hook coverage, they will never, ever let you hear a real
[35:34.120 --> 35:39.000]  quote or something I said or it's some jumbled jump shot video.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.880]  I told Megan Kelly, I think Sandy Hook happened and I'm sorry for the families, but I'm not
[35:42.880 --> 35:45.200]  the person that originally regenerated this.
[35:45.200 --> 35:48.160]  And so why are you always bringing it up?
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.440]  And that's basically my statement is that I'm going to make a Sandy Hook film now.
[35:52.440 --> 35:55.800]  I mean, and I say I'm going to make a film and then I get busy and I don't do it.
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.880]  This is the film I'm making, not about Sandy Hook, the shooting, but the clips of the news
[36:00.880 --> 36:05.360]  milking it for weeks and using the dead children to try to blame it on the American people
[36:05.360 --> 36:06.360]  and take their guns.
[36:06.360 --> 36:08.440]  They're the ones profiting from it.
[36:08.440 --> 36:12.080]  And then the lawyers and all the rest of it, all the years of me saying, I thought it
[36:12.080 --> 36:16.720]  happened, but having debates about it, then showing the clips that they showed distorted.
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.040]  Imagine, man, the anatomy of fraud.
[36:20.040 --> 36:24.920]  And then the raw Megan Kelly, what I really said to her.
[36:24.920 --> 36:26.240]  And all of that.
[36:26.240 --> 36:31.560]  And then my heartfelt letters and articles and videos, the families years before they
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.080]  sued me saying, Hey, please stop saying I said your kids didn't die.
[36:35.080 --> 36:36.840]  Please stop saying I'm sending people to your house.
[36:36.840 --> 36:37.840]  I'm not doing that.
[36:37.840 --> 36:38.840]  I never did.
[36:38.840 --> 36:43.560]  Well, what did they say to Roku Roku said yesterday, we're not going to take Mr. Jones
[36:43.560 --> 36:44.560]  down.
[36:44.560 --> 36:49.680]  We're just a platform for people have a portal for their televisions of the internet.
[36:49.680 --> 36:52.800]  You know, good old section of the telecommunications act.
[36:52.800 --> 36:58.280]  They stepped out of their protection and became curators now and said, we had to take him
[36:58.280 --> 36:59.280]  down.
[36:59.280 --> 37:00.280]  He's dangerous.
[37:00.280 --> 37:01.280]  Cause the lawyers contacted them.
[37:01.280 --> 37:04.280]  They're in the Washington Post and said he's currently sending people to their homes
[37:04.280 --> 37:05.800]  and harassing them.
[37:05.800 --> 37:07.520]  He won't stop saying no one died.
[37:07.520 --> 37:08.520]  Help us.
[37:08.520 --> 37:10.520]  It's like, it's like, call the police.
[37:10.520 --> 37:12.520]  Yes, they're coming.
[37:12.520 --> 37:13.520]  Yes.
[37:13.520 --> 37:14.520]  They're coming.
[37:14.520 --> 37:15.520]  He's sending them here.
[37:15.520 --> 37:16.520]  They're here right now.
[37:16.520 --> 37:17.520]  Everyone's in danger.
[37:17.520 --> 37:18.520]  You've got to take him off.
[37:18.520 --> 37:19.520]  He's, he's saying no one died.
[37:19.520 --> 37:20.520]  He's sending harassers.
[37:20.520 --> 37:21.520]  We're in danger here.
[37:21.520 --> 37:27.920]  Think about that.
[37:27.920 --> 37:30.400]  Think about the magnitude of that evil.
[37:30.400 --> 37:32.800]  Think about their will to carry that out and execute that.
[37:32.800 --> 37:34.120]  We're going to go to Jack Pesovic.
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.280]  I've been so flustered here.
[37:36.280 --> 37:37.800]  I haven't even combed my hair for a while on air.
[37:37.800 --> 37:45.320]  I just, I'm just fighting constantly, but it just hit me how sick this is.
[37:45.320 --> 37:47.120]  And America senses it's sick.
[37:47.120 --> 37:48.460]  It's synthetic.
[37:48.460 --> 37:54.080]  The shooting happened, but the syntheticness of the media and the hype and the manipulation
[37:54.080 --> 37:59.440]  of it and then the, the lawyers and the PR firms saying no kids died over and over again
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.160]  and Alex Jones is saying, and he's coming to their houses and there's investigators
[38:03.160 --> 38:07.880]  and that makes more and more investigators go to Connecticut.
[38:07.880 --> 38:09.800]  Just like they hype up mass shootings.
[38:09.800 --> 38:12.920]  The first one, you know, Columbine and then it causes more and more because crazy people
[38:12.920 --> 38:15.360]  go, I won't commit suicide by cop.
[38:15.360 --> 38:16.360]  I won't shoot myself.
[38:16.360 --> 38:21.920]  I'll go down at the school in a blaze of glory, selfish, evil glory, shooting my fellow classmates
[38:21.920 --> 38:23.880]  and I'll get a bunch of attention.
[38:23.880 --> 38:25.280]  They always wear black prints of coats.
[38:25.280 --> 38:26.520]  They always are devil worshipers.
[38:26.520 --> 38:27.920]  They always play shoot them up video games.
[38:27.920 --> 38:32.400]  They're always on Prozac drugs, always.
[38:32.400 --> 38:36.720]  And the phenomenon super rare before became more prevalent, still very rare, but still
[38:36.720 --> 38:37.800]  horrible.
[38:37.800 --> 38:45.800]  And it's the media creating the whole thing and the spectacle and the copycats knowingly.
[38:45.800 --> 38:48.680]  Every school year, they ramp it up that it's all about to happen.
[38:48.680 --> 38:50.720]  Every school year, the mass shootings are coming.
[38:50.720 --> 38:51.720]  There's going to be death.
[38:51.720 --> 38:53.320]  There's going to be death advertising it.
[38:53.320 --> 38:58.720]  We're going to go to Jack Posovic, but they learned decades ago that if one person jumped
[38:58.720 --> 39:01.720]  off the Empire State's building, suddenly 10 more would try, they'd have to post cops
[39:01.720 --> 39:02.720]  up there.
[39:02.720 --> 39:03.720]  It's the same thing.
[39:03.720 --> 39:04.720]  You get one mass shooting.
[39:04.720 --> 39:08.960]  Now you can cause a domino effect and then blame the American people and the American
[39:08.960 --> 39:11.480]  people are sick of being blamed for things they didn't do.
[39:11.480 --> 39:14.160]  So they started secretly going, didn't happen.
[39:14.160 --> 39:15.160]  You know what?
[39:15.160 --> 39:17.960]  It didn't happen because I didn't kill the children.
[39:17.960 --> 39:18.960]  So it's a subconscious thing.
[39:18.960 --> 39:22.560]  It didn't happen because I didn't do it.
[39:22.560 --> 39:25.400]  And I just feel really good about the truth and who I am and not what they've said.
[39:25.400 --> 39:26.400]  But this is dangerous.
[39:26.400 --> 39:30.080]  And what Roku did is dangerous because these lawyers have gone too far.
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.480]  They're in the news saying he's currently sending people to harass.
[39:33.480 --> 39:34.480]  He won't stop.
[39:34.480 --> 39:35.480]  Help us.
[39:35.480 --> 39:36.480]  Help us.
[39:36.480 --> 39:37.480]  It's creating a mass hysteria.
[39:37.480 --> 39:39.920]  Jack Posovic, Patriot, Great American.
[39:39.920 --> 39:44.720]  He's on the one American news network that is just as good as Fox or better.
[39:44.720 --> 39:46.760]  I am so proud of the work they're doing.
[39:46.760 --> 39:50.240]  And I had this idea to call him today, but he's always too busy to come on.
[39:50.240 --> 39:54.440]  But then it hit me.
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.760]  They have cloud TV that's just as good or better than Roku and isn't censoring us.
[39:58.760 --> 40:00.600]  But I thought, I don't want to draw attention to that.
[40:00.600 --> 40:01.600]  They'll probably kick me off that.
[40:01.600 --> 40:02.600]  But I said, whatever.
[40:02.600 --> 40:04.000]  But then they obviously have contacted us.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.520]  So we're going to talk about that now for this segment, a little bit of the next.
[40:06.520 --> 40:07.760]  We'll push our next guest back.
[40:07.760 --> 40:08.880]  He's going to be on as well.
[40:08.880 --> 40:13.120]  He was involved with the folks that made the new free app that wasn't even our page.
[40:13.120 --> 40:14.400]  I let fans do it.
[40:14.400 --> 40:15.840]  That's what got taken down your stay.
[40:15.840 --> 40:18.720]  Our six year old Roku got taken down as well.
[40:18.720 --> 40:20.320]  So this is them deciding what you can see.
[40:20.320 --> 40:22.320]  Jack, thanks for holding while I've been ranting.
[40:22.320 --> 40:23.640]  I'm pretty wound up here.
[40:23.640 --> 40:25.920]  But what do you make of this whole situation?
[40:25.920 --> 40:31.680]  Well, Alex, I actually had the opportunity to speak with the owner of cloud TV.
[40:31.680 --> 40:37.880]  That's cloud with a KTV earlier today because I was wondering both as a consumer of media
[40:37.880 --> 40:43.280]  and as someone who is, as is ordered for one American news as which we also are carried
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.800]  by cloud TV, and I wanted to say, okay, are you going to be following suit in terms of
[40:47.800 --> 40:48.800]  any of this?
[40:48.800 --> 40:51.360]  Are you going to be suspending info wars or anything like that?
[40:51.360 --> 40:56.000]  And what they said back to me was, Jack, we view it as a free speech issue and we're not
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.880]  going to be removing info wars that we completely stand by them.
[40:58.880 --> 41:02.080]  They're not doing anything that's causing danger.
[41:02.080 --> 41:03.560]  They're not causing extremism.
[41:03.560 --> 41:05.480]  They're not causing harm to anybody.
[41:05.480 --> 41:09.320]  And because of that, we're going to continue to allow info wars as well as one American
[41:09.320 --> 41:13.560]  news and other stations to be available through the cloud TV packages.
[41:13.560 --> 41:14.560]  They have apps.
[41:14.560 --> 41:15.560]  You can watch it on your phone.
[41:15.560 --> 41:16.560]  You can watch it on your tablet.
[41:16.560 --> 41:21.360]  If you're on the go, they have a really interesting sort of time shifting option where you can
[41:21.360 --> 41:24.080]  watch, watch back live broadcasts that we're streaming.
[41:24.080 --> 41:25.880]  So my parents actually use it.
[41:25.880 --> 41:26.880]  They love it.
[41:26.880 --> 41:30.280]  I use it when I'm on the go to watch one American news to watch my own clips or switch over
[41:30.280 --> 41:31.280]  to info wars.
[41:31.280 --> 41:33.760]  If there's something that was covered that I want to fill up.
[41:33.760 --> 41:39.920]  And so cloud TV, the one network or the one availability that's actually out there that's
[41:39.920 --> 41:44.520]  not censoring because essentially what it comes down to Alex is they don't like your
[41:44.520 --> 41:45.520]  point of view.
[41:45.520 --> 41:46.520]  They don't like your perspective.
[41:46.520 --> 41:48.680]  They don't like the things that you say.
[41:48.680 --> 41:53.080]  And so they're banning you and they're shutting you down because of your political beliefs
[41:53.080 --> 41:57.720]  and not anything to do with any of these violations of terms of service that they have to make
[41:57.720 --> 42:04.440]  up every time, because they threw you, you as a threat to actual, you know, their, their
[42:04.440 --> 42:05.440]  own agenda.
[42:05.440 --> 42:07.200]  Well, cloud TV is not playing that game.
[42:07.200 --> 42:12.320]  Cloud TV is going to allow it to be on and continue to be on now.
[42:12.320 --> 42:15.880]  One American news, I believe it's still on Roku as well.
[42:15.880 --> 42:16.880]  But who knows?
[42:16.880 --> 42:19.840]  I wouldn't surprise me if they come for us next.
[42:19.840 --> 42:24.160]  There's another phenomenon here to our app that just so happened to be launched a few
[42:24.160 --> 42:30.520]  weeks before the total ban back in August of info wars went to number one in news.
[42:30.520 --> 42:36.560]  And in the top 10 total and number one trending, we literally had millions of downloads.
[42:36.560 --> 42:37.560]  And so what do they do?
[42:37.560 --> 42:38.640]  They just deleted it.
[42:38.640 --> 42:40.960]  We're still on Google Play for now.
[42:40.960 --> 42:44.600]  But again, we're being penalized for being number one.
[42:44.600 --> 42:47.760]  And yes, I watch cloud TV over the internet.
[42:47.760 --> 42:51.880]  I'm going to put the boxes in my house and Roku is coming out.
[42:51.880 --> 42:55.720]  We've been on Roku for almost seven years and not a problem, but you see, they lied
[42:55.720 --> 42:56.720]  about us and had us removed.
[42:56.720 --> 42:59.440]  We'll be right back with Jack Possovic.
[42:59.440 --> 43:03.240]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our official oil formula or just want an

[46:34.720 --> 46:38.640]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[46:38.640 --> 46:44.600]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[46:44.600 --> 46:49.280]  All the talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.400]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[46:53.400 --> 47:03.960]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[47:03.960 --> 47:32.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:32.480 --> 47:36.160]  Sandy through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., you can find Central Shander Time, the most
[47:36.160 --> 47:39.600]  demonized light about broadcasts in the world.
[47:39.600 --> 47:47.240]  I've gone from long before they sued me, asking the Democrats that handle the Sandy Hook
[47:47.240 --> 47:51.880]  families to, hey, stop saying I said nobody died and stop saying I'm sending people to
[47:51.880 --> 47:52.880]  people's houses.
[47:52.880 --> 47:55.240]  That's making people do that and you're doing it in my name.
[47:55.240 --> 47:56.240]  Stop it.
[47:56.240 --> 47:59.160]  They're like, no, we're not going to stop anything and we're going to keep saying it
[47:59.160 --> 48:00.160]  in your name.
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.080]  If they're doing it in my name, it means they're doing it and that was part of the epiphany.
[48:05.080 --> 48:09.480]  It's how everything the globalists do is they'll use some human shields like the families
[48:09.480 --> 48:15.680]  of Sandy Hook, just like Al Qaeda will use human shields of these lawyers and people
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.040]  and they will sit there and throw these people out in front of them and then they'll say
[48:20.040 --> 48:24.400]  all these horrible things that you're saying and they're the ones saying it.
[48:24.400 --> 48:25.520]  And people are like, yeah, that's obvious.
[48:25.520 --> 48:27.280]  I know, but it's crazy.
[48:27.280 --> 48:31.600]  So this morning I thought of Jack Pesovic, I thought of one American news network that's
[48:31.600 --> 48:32.600]  exploding.
[48:32.600 --> 48:38.120]  I hear buzz about it everywhere and I thought about how I talked to the owner of Cloud TV
[48:38.120 --> 48:41.760]  who also owns many of the channels that are on there and it's giving Roku a big run for
[48:41.760 --> 48:42.760]  its money.
[48:42.760 --> 48:46.240]  Roku has decided to flush the First Amendment down the toilet.
[48:46.240 --> 48:51.280]  Our app that some fans made that authorized in one day went to the top of trending.
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.920]  There's articles about it, big league politics and other sites linked up at m4s.com.
[48:55.920 --> 48:59.240]  So again, my crime was becoming popular.
[48:59.240 --> 49:04.360]  Like we did number one in news in just a few weeks on Apple last year and so they just
[49:04.360 --> 49:05.360]  banned it.
[49:05.360 --> 49:09.320]  Tim Cook said, well, we just made the decision because everyone agrees he's bad.
[49:09.320 --> 49:13.240]  No, everyone said number one, dummy.
[49:13.240 --> 49:22.040]  So see, if the heavyweight boxer, Muhammad Ali, formerly cashed his clay, knocks you
[49:22.040 --> 49:25.520]  out, I'm going to knock you out.
[49:25.520 --> 49:27.120]  Muhammad said, knock you out.
[49:27.120 --> 49:29.920]  We knock you guys on your asses politically.
[49:29.920 --> 49:34.080]  We clean your little teleprompter reading clocks.
[49:34.080 --> 49:40.680]  And so your response is, don't let Alex Jones and his race car on the track.
[49:40.680 --> 49:44.000]  I mean, you know, I'm sweating right now, even though it's 65 degrees in there.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.880]  You know, I don't sweat in person, even hot outside, I don't sweat that much.
[49:47.880 --> 49:51.800]  I get so excited when I talk about freedom that I start sweating.
[49:51.800 --> 49:53.800]  You think those little people with weak heartbeats?
[49:53.800 --> 49:56.440]  No, my heart's boom.
[49:56.440 --> 49:57.440]  It's big.
[49:57.440 --> 49:59.080]  It's blasting blood through my body.
[49:59.080 --> 50:00.520]  I'm alive, baby.
[50:00.520 --> 50:03.240]  And I'm telling the truth and I believe in you and I'm real.
[50:03.240 --> 50:08.720]  And everybody deep down who's got discernment knows that Alex Jones is the real McCoy.
[50:08.720 --> 50:10.280]  Alex Jones is a genuine article.
[50:10.280 --> 50:14.400]  I'm committed until death against these people and I'm never backing down.
[50:14.400 --> 50:16.680]  And it's that spirit drives them crazy.
[50:16.680 --> 50:23.200]  Going back to Jack Paso, but Jack, one American news, I mean, I've gushingly said I want to
[50:23.200 --> 50:24.200]  promote it.
[50:24.200 --> 50:28.560]  So the fact that the owner of Cloud TV, that I know is a big fan of the one American news,
[50:28.560 --> 50:32.360]  because he owns it, I know that, you know, he wants to work.
[50:32.360 --> 50:33.960]  So I'm glad this is going on.
[50:33.960 --> 50:37.760]  I dropped the ball six months ago and we talked during the platform and he wanted to help.
[50:37.760 --> 50:42.120]  And so tell people, because look, our listeners, I have the app, I mean, I have it on a computer
[50:42.120 --> 50:43.120]  at home.
[50:43.120 --> 50:44.120]  I need to get it on my phone.
[50:44.120 --> 50:45.120]  I mean, I get busy.
[50:45.120 --> 50:47.800]  But everybody needs to get the box and you're not an advertiser.
[50:47.800 --> 50:49.360]  This is just happening.
[50:49.360 --> 50:50.800]  So how do people get it?
[50:50.800 --> 50:59.840]  They go to Cloud TV with a K, K-L-O-W-D, and you get the Cloud TV box and it is amazing.
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.520]  And I want to see this absolutely dominate the libtards over there at their little purple,
[51:06.520 --> 51:10.200]  whatever it's called, you know, Roku.
[51:10.200 --> 51:11.200]  So I've been ranting.
[51:11.200 --> 51:12.720]  You've got the floor in the next seven minutes.
[51:12.720 --> 51:15.160]  Tell us what else you think is going to come out of all this.
[51:15.160 --> 51:16.680]  Well, that's right.
[51:16.680 --> 51:20.760]  And just looking at the website there is there's a couple of different versions.
[51:20.760 --> 51:22.880]  There's two versions of the box that are available for people.
[51:22.880 --> 51:28.600]  You can get a box that has Wi-Fi set up so you can hook it up wirelessly to your TV.
[51:28.600 --> 51:32.120]  There's also a box that hooks up directly and it's got deep.
[51:32.120 --> 51:33.120]  There's two versions, right?
[51:33.120 --> 51:35.680]  There's the one that hooks up directly and then there's the other one that actually has
[51:35.680 --> 51:36.680]  a DVR support.
[51:36.680 --> 51:39.880]  So that DVR one, you can record whatever you want.
[51:39.880 --> 51:42.560]  You can watch your local channels for free.
[51:42.560 --> 51:44.840]  You can basically pull up everything that you want.
[51:44.840 --> 51:48.320]  You can run your Hulu through there, your Amazon Prime, your Netflix.
[51:48.320 --> 51:52.160]  So in addition to, you're getting what American News, you're getting InfoWars.
[51:52.160 --> 51:53.880]  So you've got it all in one place.
[51:53.880 --> 51:58.520]  And I think it's like over 80 channels for like 10 bucks a month, way, way cheaper than
[51:58.520 --> 52:00.360]  anybody else is offering out there.
[52:00.360 --> 52:03.480]  And it's the stuff that you want and not the stuff that you don't, right?
[52:03.480 --> 52:04.880]  So it's easy.
[52:04.880 --> 52:11.760]  And more and more as the censorship continues and as the Big Tech Silicon Valley censorship,
[52:11.760 --> 52:16.000]  I mean, we talked about the Democrats going down to Puerto Rico recently, I reported that
[52:16.000 --> 52:20.360]  Big Tech was a big funder of that trip of the Democrats down in Puerto Rico because
[52:20.360 --> 52:25.240]  they're huge funders to that block pack, the super pack that was able to sponsor that
[52:25.240 --> 52:26.240]  trip.
[52:26.240 --> 52:27.240]  Facebook was down there.
[52:27.240 --> 52:28.240]  Their lobbyists were down there.
[52:28.240 --> 52:32.240]  A lot of Silicon Valley was down there talking to Democrats who are now controlling the house.
[52:32.240 --> 52:34.480]  And you know that that's exactly what they want.
[52:34.480 --> 52:39.080]  You know that they want people who have alternate opinions, who have other sources of information
[52:39.080 --> 52:40.560]  out there to be censored.
[52:40.560 --> 52:45.480]  And they're working hand and glove with the Democrat party, the new majority in the house.
[52:45.480 --> 52:47.760]  They're going right to Silicon Valley and saying, what do you want?
[52:47.760 --> 52:48.760]  What is your wish?
[52:48.760 --> 52:52.000]  You know, you're sponsoring our beautiful trip to Puerto Rico, whatever we can do for
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  you.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.440]  We'll let you do it and give you the legal cover that you need.
[52:55.440 --> 52:59.680]  The lack of regulation, the lack of oversight that we should be getting from any communications
[52:59.680 --> 53:04.280]  platform in Washington, DC, they're giving them a free run because they're all bought
[53:04.280 --> 53:06.120]  and sold by Silicon Valley.
[53:06.120 --> 53:10.480]  And I know I'm focusing on the Democrats, but there's plenty of Republicans and independence
[53:10.480 --> 53:12.360]  that are involved in that as well.
[53:12.360 --> 53:16.040]  When you're an expert on China, you've also enabled intelligence, you've lived in China
[53:16.040 --> 53:18.920]  and done a lot of important work that you obviously can't get into.
[53:18.920 --> 53:23.080]  But Silicon Valley is dominated by Chinese money.
[53:23.080 --> 53:25.480]  Hollywood is 90% now Chinese.
[53:25.480 --> 53:28.520]  That's Wall Street Journal six, seven years after I first said it.
[53:28.520 --> 53:31.200]  When I first said China runs Hollywood, people said, you're nuts.
[53:31.200 --> 53:33.320]  No, they now own it.
[53:33.320 --> 53:37.560]  Six of the eight big production houses, Trump blocked them buying American Bandstand, which
[53:37.560 --> 53:38.960]  sounds like it's not big.
[53:38.960 --> 53:40.560]  It's a huge production house.
[53:40.560 --> 53:47.000]  So this is a war, so it's not just Apple and Google moving to China, helping censor.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.280]  They're doing it here.
[53:48.280 --> 53:50.360]  They're bringing Chinese style net censorship here.
[53:50.360 --> 53:58.040]  And I know that Google is buying the average house member for about $10,000 a year, $20,000
[53:58.040 --> 53:59.480]  for the two years they're in.
[53:59.480 --> 54:04.280]  Even senior committee heads are only getting about $40,000 every election.
[54:04.280 --> 54:05.920]  Not even that much money.
[54:05.920 --> 54:08.200]  That's the joke of it all, right?
[54:08.200 --> 54:12.120]  Our politicians are being bought and sold for not even really all that much money.
[54:12.120 --> 54:16.920]  $25,000, I think, with Jerry Nadler, just a couple thousand here, a couple thousand
[54:16.920 --> 54:17.920]  there.
[54:17.920 --> 54:18.920]  And it's enough.
[54:18.920 --> 54:21.920]  It's enough for them to do their bidding to push their agenda to not really ask them
[54:21.920 --> 54:22.920]  serious questions.
[54:22.920 --> 54:23.920]  So this is the national security issue.
[54:23.920 --> 54:24.920]  Let me ask you that then.
[54:24.920 --> 54:25.920]  This is a national security issue.
[54:25.920 --> 54:31.440]  Hardcore Soviet style censorship, chai combat, walking in, taking over Congress.
[54:31.440 --> 54:32.440]  This is an emergency.
[54:32.440 --> 54:33.440]  What is the president?
[54:33.440 --> 54:35.480]  We're going to talk about foreign influence, right?
[54:35.480 --> 54:40.000]  They talk about foreign influence when it's fake in terms of Trump and Russia.
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.800]  But they never want to talk about the actual foreign influence of China.
[54:42.800 --> 54:46.560]  They never want to talk about the influence of Qatar, all the money that's floating around
[54:46.560 --> 54:50.640]  in Washington, DC, the Chinese money floating around Hollywood, Silicon Valley, that then
[54:50.640 --> 54:52.640]  trickles down to Washington, DC.
[54:52.640 --> 54:54.160]  They don't want to talk about that at all.
[54:54.160 --> 54:59.560]  They want you focused on Russia, which has an economy the size of less than New York
[54:59.560 --> 55:01.080]  City, right?
[55:01.080 --> 55:06.200]  They want you wrapped in some sort of like Tom Clancy fantasy novel when they're not
[55:06.200 --> 55:09.400]  looking at the actual foreign influence that's going on in China.
[55:09.400 --> 55:14.920]  They've got this company Huawei now, which is really an arm of the Chinese state security.
[55:14.920 --> 55:18.800]  Everyone who's using a Huawei phone, the China is just listening to that.
[55:18.800 --> 55:20.280]  And these phones are getting really big.
[55:20.280 --> 55:23.920]  They're focusing on Europe right now, but Huawei phones are going to come to the United
[55:23.920 --> 55:26.000]  States and Apple knows this.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.320]  And that's why Apple is working closely with Huawei because they don't want to have to
[55:29.320 --> 55:33.240]  fight Huawei in the US market until they have to.
[55:33.240 --> 55:35.440]  But it's going to come and it's going to come down to it.
[55:35.440 --> 55:38.560]  And eventually it's going to be interesting to see if Huawei is able to actually beat
[55:38.560 --> 55:39.560]  Apple.
[55:39.560 --> 55:42.040]  But if they are, then we're all going to be hooked up to the Chinese grid, that their
[55:42.040 --> 55:45.040]  state security is going to piggyback directly on their devices.
[55:45.040 --> 55:49.880]  The company was founded by a former general staff officer of the Chinese army, the People's
[55:49.880 --> 55:50.880]  Liberation Army.
[55:50.880 --> 55:52.240]  It's incredible.
[55:52.240 --> 55:54.440]  And Trump is moving on them on that level.
[55:54.440 --> 55:55.440]  So that's important.
[55:55.440 --> 55:59.560]  Please join us again very soon to get into China, to get into what's happening on Capitol
[55:59.560 --> 56:00.560]  Hill.
[56:00.560 --> 56:03.880]  I know you're going to grab some clips from this and put it on a report for One American
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.880]  News Network, but everyone needs to go to cloud TV.
[56:07.880 --> 56:09.240]  There's also a phone number there.
[56:09.240 --> 56:12.680]  We should get the phone number and give that up for folks so they can get it, plug it in.
[56:12.680 --> 56:18.280]  It's got Wi-Fi or it's got plugged right into the box and it is extremely amazing, way
[56:18.280 --> 56:23.680]  better than Roku and it's supporting freedom and it's getting bigger all the time.
[56:23.680 --> 56:25.760]  This is absolutely essential.
[56:25.760 --> 56:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much, Jack the Subic.
[56:28.000 --> 56:29.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.000]  Thank you.
[56:30.000 --> 56:35.680]  Now, one door closes, another door opens.
[56:35.680 --> 56:39.400]  I'm not here trying to climb a ladder to see how much money I can make.
[56:39.400 --> 56:46.160]  If I can make money to fight the globalists, then I'll do it if it's moral, but I won't
[56:46.160 --> 56:48.960]  do anything if it's screwing somebody over.
[56:48.960 --> 56:50.880]  I want to explain something.
[56:50.880 --> 56:57.120]  The globalists go from super evil to absolutely pure satanist, child molesters, child killers.
[56:57.120 --> 56:59.400]  That's all coming out in the news.
[56:59.400 --> 57:05.920]  You sign on with them, you're signing on with the act of hurting children, the act of corrupting
[57:05.920 --> 57:06.920]  them.
[57:06.920 --> 57:09.680]  And now they're sick evils about to come out in the open fully.
[57:09.680 --> 57:13.800]  That's why I've got to be off the air because it validates everything we've said.
[57:13.800 --> 57:17.800]  So this evil globalist system that hurts children finds some story we've covered to
[57:17.800 --> 57:22.960]  twist and say, I'm hurting children or families of dead children to try to bring us down.
[57:22.960 --> 57:26.640]  Just remember, I get so fired up fighting the globalists that I haven't plugged once
[57:26.640 --> 57:27.640]  this hour.

[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:22.840]  In deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840]  Jones.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:30.720]  They say I'm too Goku for Roku, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.800]  I am not a big anime fan, I don't really follow it, but they put me in a lot of them, so I
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.800]  guess I am a fan now.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:41.840]  So that's a weird archaic, what do you say, archaic, just a interesting piece of factoid
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.160]  lore.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:52.000]  Alright, there's so many angles, there's so many facets to this.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.240]  The free press, so-called, land of the free home of the brave, papers in Germany, England,
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:05.760]  the US, Canada, yay, take Alex Jones off, he's evil, he's bad, he's sending people
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.960]  to be mean to children, and then the lawyers use my voice to say things I haven't ever
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.960]  said.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.480]  And it was kind of a, I mean I already knew that, but it was like really an awakening
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.680]  that we keep doing videos and sending them letters and responding and saying stop, stop,
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.040]  and they're like nope, we're not going to stop, so okay, well, I'm going to have to
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:30.680]  do something, leave it at that, so that's where all this is going.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.120]  And then you've got Roku saying we believe in the First Amendment, and then hours later
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.600]  taking down the app, it's like a severed head or something that they're shaking around
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.360]  like, you know, Pygmies or folks in Afghanistan playing polo with human heads, we got him,
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.440]  we got him, he spent all the money on this app, and we took him down.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.880]  I heard about it a few months ago, hey, there's some veterans and some patriots building a
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:59.320]  first class app, or paid for Roku, and we were getting over a million viewers a week
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:06.640]  on Roku, so I was like, oh, that's great, launches one day, goes to number one, and
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.960]  then the trending, and they just went to the front page, and it freaked out the left, so
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.960]  they all jumped in action, and it made the Sandy Hook lawyers just go into like piranha
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.560]  mode, just feeding frenzy, and they were just like, we're under attack, he's sending people
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:23.240]  right now, those are the quotes, help the children, he's sending them, the parents,
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.120]  God, please, no, God, he's on the air, and I'm like, of course, never said that, and
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.960]  I'm not saying it currently, and they're like, we're sorry, we didn't know he was trying
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.800]  to send people to hurt people, well, he's down, he's down, that's the real defamation
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.960]  right there, they're like, we want you off the air, and so we're gonna keep saying you're
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:46.200]  doing this currently, and I'm just like, wow, you just crossed the Rubicon, you just crossed
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.480]  the Rubicon in a massive way, now he's been with us for the next 30 minutes, and we've
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.040]  got Tom Pappet, who does an amazing job, manages a TV station, and has his own successful show,
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:03.880]  he's on Twitter at Real GE Trump, at Real GE Trump, and on Facebook he is God Emperor
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.200]  Trump official, so we should have introduced him that way, and I know I'm ranting, I'm
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.600]  gonna shut up and let him talk, what do you make of all this, you also write for big league
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.600]  politics?
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.320]  You know, Alex, I think what this is, is a brilliant example of how the left wing marches
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.960]  in lockstep with their allies in the media, you know, I'm convinced, we had lots of downloads
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.400]  on the app, the guy who made it talk to me said there were thousands of downloads on
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.480]  day one, it was extremely successful with no marketing, but I'm convinced that the left
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.600]  stocks you, Alex, I think they've been watching you, they have a Google alert set up, they
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.880]  found out about this app, and they called in all of their allies, because it was every
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.760]  single outlet, from the Daily Beast to the Huffington Post to the New York Times to the
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:49.360]  Washington Post, all within a couple hours, before anybody on the right even knew about
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.960]  this app, we had the left rioting in the streets practically, saying that Alex Jones needs
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.840]  to be pulled off Roku, so I think the real interesting thing here is, they played their
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.800]  card a little too strong, they showed their hand, I think, we now know that this is all
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:07.800]  about censoring you, it's all about economically strangling info wars, there's no grassroots
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.680]  movement, there's no people that are concerned you're profiting off the lives of dead children,
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.320]  that's all just a fictitious nonsense that the leftist media created so they could have
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.480]  an excuse to go after you, which is, I think, what this is all about.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.640]  And by the way, you're a better talk show host than I am in many ways, you kind of leave
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.840]  a little to be discovered, I always say it up front, they're in the Washington Post and
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.440]  New York Times, how they blueprinted it, how Jack Darcy at CNN quarterbacked it, but then
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:38.200]  they sent in the Sandy Hook lawyers to say I was coming after the families right now,
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.960]  you got to get him off us, the wolfs at the door, call the SWAT team, God, Jones, stop
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:47.320]  it, no, he's here, God, Lord, April's room split in the base, and they're like, we better
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.160]  take him down, hell, none of it was true, but hey, so what?
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.840]  It might cost money if we don't, right, you got to get Alex gone.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.480]  You got to get rid of him.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.920]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.000]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.640]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.040]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:16.760]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:22.560]  anchovy fish oil, ultra purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.920]  boost your child's mind and body.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.480]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive,
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.200]  and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.960]  brain growth spurts.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:43.320]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.640]  refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:51.080]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:06:15.520]  Try Honor Roll from InfowarsLife at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:29.960]  We're now into the second hour of the worldwide broadcast, and you know, I didn't invent
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:38.660]  gonzojournalism like Hunter S. Thompson, but you could say Alex Jones is the king of unintentional
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:46.280]  gonzojournalism because any subject, anything we do, instantly the story becomes Alex Jones,
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.400]  which they kind of created their own monster because I can go to any press conference,
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:55.120]  any public event, and just take it over in minutes, and they don't know what to do.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.560]  Because we were huge with our awesome audience, God bless, and we wouldn't be here without
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.960]  them trying to change the world and changing the world, but with the left, they just ignored
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:11.800]  us, but now they've turned me into Godzilla, Mothra, King Kong, all at once, and I've got
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.600]  to be destroyed.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:19.040]  And so, a new fan app that we authorized in like a two-minute meeting, I said, sure, let
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.760]  folks build a fan app, fine, great.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.000]  For Roku, we have an old cruddy one that we built seven years ago, and when I say cruddy,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.880]  I mean, it was seven years ago, and it had over a million views a week, but it just had
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:35.480]  some of the videos that got fed to it, and it was all broken, well, this new one started
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.560]  shooting to the top, and so it was on the front page because it was most popular.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.200]  That's how their algorithm works, and so it was red alert.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.280]  They don't want to see something in the left that's there.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.840]  And so it went into overdrive, and all this happened, and then the Washington Post says
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.280]  they called in the cavalry.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.600]  When Roku said, we're not going to ban Jones, he doesn't do anything illegal, we're just
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.880]  a platform, a window to the internet for your television, they called in the Sandy Hook lawyers
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.480]  who said, and I've got the quotes here, that Jones is harassing and sending people to family's
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:15.920]  homes right now, clear and present danger, you know, the robbers are at the door, basically.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:22.160]  They're alert, we have an emergency, never said go to their houses, never said do any
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:28.120]  of that, but they keep saying it in my voice, which is extremely actionable, but they can't
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120]  help it.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.120]  They can't stop doing it, because the Democratic Party uses the poor children and the families
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:40.040]  that have been traumatized that they've gotten into their system, in my view, to come after
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:47.320]  me, and to go at me, and to say things in my name that they say.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:52.240]  So my identity has been stolen by the Democratic Party and the spin machine, because when Hillary
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.440]  Clinton gave that dark heart speech, and she said, I am to blame, and that Alex Jones is
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.760]  the most horrible person in the world, what did St. Ugar of the young turds say?
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.800]  He said, Alex Jones is the worst person in the world for saying George Soros was a Nazi
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:12.440]  collaborator, he said he was a hero that was captured by the Nazis.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:22.720]  I mean, I guess you could say Hitler was captured by the Nazis, so by that extension.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.240]  So that's on 60 Minutes, that's on NPR, that's in magazine interviews, he did it, he said
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.240]  it.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:34.840]  Oh, but the Nazi collaborator, he's not bad, not the media promoting the dead children constantly
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:38.680]  and demonizing the Second Amendment, getting ratings out of it, oh no, I'm the one that
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:43.360]  profited from it, and I guess they kind of think I must be like them, because in this
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.840]  latest thing they're like, show us all the marketing material about Sandy Hook.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.560]  Oh, you mean how the stations didn't like us saying it was staged and I lost stations?
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.680]  You mean, there isn't marketing material, I get a piece of paper about what I think
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.960]  about something and I talk to a camera, there's your marketing around here, that's your marketing
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.280]  department, I come up with the basic designs, the banners and stuff, probably not the best
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:08.400]  at it, we have a great crew over there, but let me go to our guest.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:14.800]  It's the epiphany that, I'm not looking forward to all this, but I think the truth's gonna
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:20.040]  come out in the end, because they've overplayed, they've gone so far, and they're using me,
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.600]  once the president's set, to take everybody else off.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.720]  And that's what's so dangerous here, it's like Congressman Steve King, Western civilization's
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.720]  great, we should be proud of it, we should teach it in civics, we should have English
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.280]  be the national language, if you don't have that, you die.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:42.000]  That's basic boilerplate stuff you gotta have, like bulkheads on submarines, you can't have
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.080]  screen doors, okay, it's like oxygen, you gotta have it.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:51.240]  They scramble this quote where he says, you know, don't compare nationalism and Western
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.720]  civilization to white supremacy, they're not.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.720]  And they call that defending, well they say Trump's dirty for saying nationalism, this
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.160]  is what these people are doing, and you've talked the average liberal leftist, they are
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:08.600]  mental patients, the only followers of this are a bunch of mental patients whose only
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.720]  power is getting in everybody's face and trying to control the narrative, and trying
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.640]  to make us their slaves, trying to turn the reality upside down.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.520]  And because the globalists are solo sociopaths, they always try to find a cause or some children
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:26.320]  or something they can use to make them look good, but in reality, they don't care about
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.880]  the deadly vaccines or the GMOs or the millions killed by radical Islam, they don't care about
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.520]  any of that real stuff, they don't care about the migrant children with all the diseases
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.400]  bringing it into the U.S. and the schools, they care about power.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.880]  Going back to our guest, Tom Pappert, who's awesome, a little wound up today, at Twitter
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:50.280]  at Real, Real, G-E-Trump, and of course, God Emperor Trump official on Facebook, he is
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.200]  awesome, he's also a radio and TV host.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.960]  I'm gonna shut up now for this segment and the next, because you made some incredible
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.760]  observations, and again, I don't want to talk about myself all day, this is like a window
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.440]  into the world though, how they're doing this, how they're getting more crazed, how they're
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.480]  getting more territory every day, how they're destroying rights and freedom everywhere.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.280]  We sit back and go, my God, this is insane, but you know what?
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.400]  They're taking over, what do we need to do?
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.840]  Well, one thing that I want to point out is they're making this about you, they're making
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.040]  you talk about yourself.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.280]  You know, I honestly doubt, Alex, that you would have ever uttered the word Sandy Hook
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.560]  over the past, probably three or four years, had it not been for all these lawsuits, had
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:29.520]  it not been for all these false quotes that they attribute to you and false actions that
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.640]  they attribute to you, you don't care about dead kids, Info Wars has plenty of ways to
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:40.240]  make money, I've got three of them right here on my desk right now, without any dead kids.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.120]  That's not Alex Jones, that's them, they're the ones dragging them into this over and
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.160]  over and over again, putting the parents through trauma over and over and over again.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.120]  That is completely the left, nothing to do with Info Wars.
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:56.000]  Now, as far as some kind of way to get out of this, I think I spoke to the creator of
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.680]  the app last night, interviewed him on my show, and I think he's right when he says
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.280]  two different approaches, one, we need to get distributed.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.440]  The blockchain is great, we need to start, you know, if we're not going to be totally
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:10.240]  active on these new social media networks, maybe we just form a presence on there and
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.720]  pop in every so often, be distributed, don't make it so they can shut you down in one place.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.320]  And then the other thing is conservatives have got to get angry because Roku first said,
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.920]  we believe in the first amendment, we believe Alex Jones has a right to speak, we're not
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:27.760]  going to get into the business of violating the first amendment.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.880]  That was Roku's original statement.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.600]  They actually put that out on Twitter and later deleted it after the leftist mob came
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.600]  to attack them.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.400]  And you see, all of this is just fear of the leftist mob, they're afraid that the Huffington
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:43.840]  Post is going to go and contact all of their advertisers and say, don't buy any more ads
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.120]  on Roku because they support Alex Jones, which means they think kids should die.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.040]  So the bottom line is they're a bunch of bullies and we've got to call their bluff and that's
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:56.040]  what I should have said up front, yes, this is bullying, they accuse us of being bullies,
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.480]  no, they are the bullies and they are running rampant.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.760]  And the people defending against the bully, that's not another bully.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:03.760]  That's a hero.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.920]  That is the hero who comes in to protect the weak children.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.680]  So when we defend ourselves, when we say, well, you know what, I'm not going to buy
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:15.280]  Roku, I'm not going to use Roku, it's gone.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.480]  Because of that, that makes a big difference.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.040]  I think it does at least because that's all the fear is here.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.600]  It's all money to Roku.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.840]  I think this is the first example where this hasn't been ideology.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.560]  Obviously, Tim Cook at Apple hates your guts.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.520]  Jack Dorsey at Twitter hates your guts.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.920]  Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook hates your guts.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.840]  But I think this is the first time where a company wanted to do the right thing and they
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:41.080]  were so terrified, literally shaking in their boots that they just said, okay, okay, okay,
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.520]  okay, leftist, we'll do whatever you want.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.520]  Get rid of Alex Jones, sure.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:44.520]  Okay, okay.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.000]  Yep, keep the young Turks on the platform.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  You got it.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.640]  Just don't go after our advertisers, please, we need the money.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.480]  And we need to show them that conservatives, we're the ones who really have this money.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:59.440]  You know, and just at an instinctive, cellular level, I don't like boycotts and I don't like
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.080]  throwing weight around, but they started it and I agree.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.520]  I haven't gotten my Gillette Razors out yet and thrown them in the trash and made a stunt
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.520]  out of it.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520]  I'm going to do that today.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.240]  I have Roku in my house.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.800]  I also have a cloud TV on the computer here at the office.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.720]  I'm going to pull it out and I'm going to smash it.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:21.240]  I'm going to encourage everybody to call them and email them and let them know it is out
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.000]  of our house.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.880]  And also all these big, the NFL, they're down 30 plus percent with all their anti-American
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.880]  crap.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:29.880]  Good, let it all die.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:30.880]  You're right.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.880]  We work, we have the power.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:32.880]  We're the adults.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.520]  We're not the mental patient globalist and we're done.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.360]  And that's what I feel at a gut level last night this morning.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.880]  All of a sudden feel really good.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.960]  I've never felt this good and it's an instinctive and spiritual understanding, but also political
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.320]  time that we're going to win and they've gone way too far.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.480]  We'll be back with Tom Paffert of God, Emperor Trump.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.480]  Stay with us.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480]  M4Wars.com.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:22.480]  We'll be right back with Tom Paffert of God and we'll be back with Tom Paffert of God.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:47.480]  We'll be right back with Tom Paffert of God and we'll be back with Tom Paffert of God
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:17:13.480]  and we'll be back with Tom Paffert of God.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:28.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.240]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.800]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.760]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.040]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.280]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.620]  I can help you too.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.640]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.840]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:58.280]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.920]  Defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:05.480]  Defeat the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:10.440]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.960]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.080]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.680]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.440]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now and if
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:33.000]  all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.920]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:42.920]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:47.600]  Call and talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.880]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:58.240]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.280]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:07.520]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.760]  It literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers,
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.360]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.480]  First seaweed based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source and the globalists
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.440]  tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:28.480]  So we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.480]  incredible.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.280]  And now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.880]  more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.320]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:47.400]  three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.800]  it even more bioavailable.
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.960]  discovery.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:01.480]  This is Alex Jones, Alex3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:12.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:25.920]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:50.920]  If you just joined us, this is the Alex Jones show, I'm Alex Jones, we have talk show host,
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:57.600]  TV station manager, Tom Pappard, he's on Facebook at godimpertrumpofficial and on Twitter, real
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.440]  GE Trump.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:06.520]  And he's a smart cookie and we're looking at all the perspectives of Roku in less than
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:12.840]  six, seven hours after a total hysteria launched by the organized fascist left, having me taken
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:20.400]  off of Roku, where we had an app for our page for almost seven years, over a million people
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:25.040]  just on our old Roku system we made, we're watching it every week, we had those statistics
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.040]  from them.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.520]  And then some fans and the gentlemen joining us next segment built it, started out on Veterans
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:35.120]  Day last year because they were worried about what they saw happening, built a first class
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:39.080]  app, it's shot to the front page because the algorithm showed that it was going towards
[01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:44.120]  the top and we've had other apps go to number one in news like Apple and then they banned
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.120]  that.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.120]  We're still on Google Play for now.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:53.120]  It's really important to go there to infowars.com or infowars.com or infowars.com and get those
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:22:00.840]  because for now, when they took our app off Apple, it's still there if you got it via
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.000]  Apple and it'll be the same thing if they do that via Google Play, which we know is
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.800]  getting targeted by the globalists as well, they are lobbying heavily to have that taken.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:11.920]  But if you have it on your phone or on your computer, then you at least still have it.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.880]  So infowars.com and I know a lot of you already have it.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.880]  Tell others, hey, find out what's so verboten.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.920]  Go get this information for yourself.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.760]  This is incredibly important and again, I know I lobby and push the listeners to help
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.960]  us and spread the word.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.560]  You're the real power of this operation.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:28.680]  Without you, it's over.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.640]  But they are working around the clock to take us off the air and the reason I was getting
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.080]  Tom on, we've got to get him on more often is he crystallized it all right up front.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.120]  The whole thing with this broadcast should have been from the beginning, not just how
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.520]  they're saying things in my name.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.120]  I didn't say they're the ones actually saying the stuff.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.520]  They say it's hurtful and horrible.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:51.680]  That's big, but not as big as these bullies are out of control.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:56.600]  They're running around and organized brigades trying to silence everyone.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:01.640]  They're clear and present authoritarians and conservatives need to boycott Gillette saying
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:05.760]  men having hair is evil, but that men are bad, literally.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:11.440]  We need to boycott all of these people, the NFL, the NBA, all these anti-American groups
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.920]  ladies and gentlemen, and let them know.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.120]  Not just give them a political bloody nose, but politically in them.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.400]  They're trying to end us.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.520]  They started the fight.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.680]  Withdraw your money from these stinking bastards now.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.760]  Roku, absolute crap.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:27.760]  Everyone needs to remove it.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.280]  But any of these big outfits, let me tell you, you want to kill the cable companies and the
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:42.800]  pedophile obsessed things out there like the whole situation with Netflix, you must get
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.480]  the digital antennas, hundreds of channels in big cities, dozens and dozens in small
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.840]  towns, sub channels.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:54.480]  When I moved once and didn't have cable and stuff hooked up, I went and bought, I'm not
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.520]  just saying this because Tom manages a TV station, we just happened to be on, in, was
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:05.560]  in Kansas, it's that, this is so critical, this was like three years ago, I was like,
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:11.440]  my God, there's hundreds of channels in Austin, all the old reruns, nine channels of PBS,
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.800]  all the old front lines, all the old documentaries, all the old World War II movies, all the old
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:22.840]  John Wayne movies, all the Clint Eastwood movies, Bonanza, Rawhide, hilarious Mexican
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.800]  TV, 20 channels of that.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:29.160]  I mean, just, I'm watching the Mexican film, you know, film stars, how could you quit looking?
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:31.560]  Female stars, the best looking woman out there.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:36.760]  And you're sitting there looking at all of this, and it's just completely insane.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.040]  And meanwhile, it's free.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040]  It's free.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.680]  And that's the revolution I've wanted to get on local, low-powered TV stations, digital
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.480]  channels, big stations, you name it, which we've gotten on a lot of them, is that people
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:53.280]  can learn that that's how they do it and pay zero to the dirtbag Hollywood scum.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:58.160]  I want to destroy Netflix and all these outfits, ladies and gentlemen, and you do it by getting
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.480]  shows like this on local TV.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:03.000]  I know, Tom, you got to get back to work, and I've been running over, and I'm so hyped
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  up today.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  I apologize.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  Tom, continue on with us.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.920]  Alex, I'm happy to stay as long as you want me.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:09.920]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.120]  I want to say one thing about local, low-power TV.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:14.620]  Like you said, all you need is an antenna.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:19.200]  The average little tiny city, I live in Wichita, Kansas, like 300,000 people living here.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.200]  That's all.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:22.000]  We have 80 channels you can get with an antenna.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.440]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:29.560]  And one of them, of course, is InfoWars TV, a 24-7 live TV network, starts with David
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.600]  Knight in the morning, you in the midday, Owen Schreuer, it's, of course, got the weekend
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.920]  programming as well with Mike Adams.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:40.120]  And it is possibly the most watched TV channel in the city at this point.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:46.440]  I mean, I say that without ascent as a modicum of irony in me, because people are finding
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.440]  out about it.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.000]  They're finding out that nobody's going to take it down unless there's some kind of
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.840]  grassroots campaign to boycott the TV station, and then they get scared.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.280]  But we have something called the FCC that's going to protect you here.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:04.160]  There's nobody like Tim Cook who's going to say, all right, no more Alex on this TV channel.
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.160]  Doesn't work that way.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.160]  The government comes in.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:10.080]  The government actually does its job and protects the freedom of speech on the public
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.360]  airwaves, which I think is why it's so crucial.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:17.600]  Because just today, this morning, we wake up and we see now there's another article saying
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.800]  that you need to be banned from Facebook again.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.680]  We even knew you had anything left on Facebook.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.920]  I know you've got the News Wars page.
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.880]  Paul Joseph Watson has some pages on there.
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.520]  And then, of course, there's a fan made one that they attribute to you.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:33.120]  And those are fan pages too.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.920]  I mean, sometimes I guess the social network guys send people links and things on the list.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.800]  But yes, they're hunting it down like if I even have a voice or if I even have a chance
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:47.960]  to respond on Facebook to lies that they're saying about me, I've got to be taken down.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960]  Right.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.800]  The next step is going to be ban anybody who talks about Alex Jones, which I think is already
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.360]  happening in the algorithm.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:58.440]  Anytime we write an article about you, Alex, if we put your face in it, the reach goes
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.640]  very far lower than what we expected.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.640]  It's a viral looking article.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.480]  It's got Alex Jones in the headline.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.520]  It should be everybody's favorite article of the day.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.920]  I honestly believe if your face is in it, if your full name Alex Jones is in it, they're
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.680]  going to do what they can to take it back.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.080]  So that's the next step.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:16.800]  Anybody who even talks about Alex Jones, you're going to get a Snopes.com article underneath
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.840]  their comment saying, did you know this comment is fake news?
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.640]  Alex Jones hates kids.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.040]  That's where we're heading with all this stuff.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.700]  We have to ban anybody who even wants to defend you.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:29.920]  And I think again, the solution is to get away from these people.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.080]  Maybe we just don't spend so much time on Facebook.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.440]  Maybe instead of watching it on a Roku device, we get an antenna and watch you on channel
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.320]  5.4 at Wichita, Kansas.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.080]  There are lots of other ways we can fight these people economically.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.740]  And the next thing I think we need to do is say, well, who's advertising on Roku?
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.320]  Who are they worried about losing?
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:51.680]  Well, maybe some of those people are companies that have conservative leanings.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.560]  Maybe we need to start contacting them and say, hey, did you know that you're spending
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.640]  money with a company that is firmly anti-first amendment?
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.200]  Can you defend that for me, please?
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.800]  Can you defend why your company supports demolishing the first amendment?
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.560]  I don't know how these people will answer.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.800]  And I think of enough conservatives demand an answer.
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.240]  They're going to be in trouble.
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.280]  Tom Pappert, you're absolutely right.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:17.800]  There's something really sexy about the government and Tim Cook and the media not knowing what
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.160]  you're watching and listening to.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:22.600]  Sure, it's fun to click it and pause it and have it when you want it with all this digital
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.600]  stuff.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:27.360]  But there's something so much fun about the antenna hooked into the TV.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:32.800]  And then it's like, whatever's on, you go around looking and it's like, it's more fun.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.600]  And it's just, and I'm telling you, that's the answer to the point, folks.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:41.360]  I think I'm going to buy digital TV antennas in mass and just shell them at cost to listeners
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:48.920]  at m4store.com to just really hype that revolution of getting back to where you see the information,
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:49.920]  it doesn't see you.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.640]  Ever think of that?
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:52.640]  You watch TV.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.640]  It doesn't watch you.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.640]  We'll be right back.

[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.720]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts, they even know we had like InfoWars stores
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:14.040]  that just showed our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:17.880]  I be in a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.

[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:29.120]  pesky in the future.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.200]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.

[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.600]  We have Tom Papert riding shotgun with us.
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.080]  He is the manager at one of the great TV stations we're on that is one of the highest
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:11.560]  rated, if not the most, watch channel in Wichita that we're on 24 hours a day, InfoWars TV
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.480]  that was on Roku now off.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:20.200]  And then we've also got John of OTP, InfoWars Roku app developer who were listeners.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.240]  They contacted Zimmerman.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.960]  The memory serves a few months ago and said, hey, these developers are really good developers.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]  They want to build this for free.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:28.360]  Can they have the authorization?
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.960]  And I said, absolutely.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:35.280]  And it went to the front page the first day and then it got banned by the left because
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:40.120]  they said that I was sending people live time, continuing to do horrible things and send
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.240]  people to the houses of Sandy Hook children, which I never did, period.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.200]  So it's simply insane.
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.760]  Now we also are going to have our sound guy.
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:50.760]  He'll just go by a Connor.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.040]  So I've told the crew anytime they want to pop in on air and make these great points
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.240]  from the brakes, please do it.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:00.280]  And he was talking about a book he read about television and the history of it, which is
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.280]  totally true.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.960]  And if you understand this, it is super deep.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:10.280]  And then you understand the entire enchilada of how at first, why was TV so wholesome,
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.720]  so good, so avant-garde?
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:17.840]  Because it was reflecting the world it already saw, make TV like it was.
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.400]  And that's how it was, folks, especially in America.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:25.240]  The globalists were threatened by the superior civilization.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.720]  That's what everybody wanted to get into America.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.080]  It was pretty much like in most areas, what you saw on Leave It to Beaver or what you
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.240]  saw on Gunsmoke, okay?
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:39.160]  And so John Wayne was just the regular dude.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.920]  The guys in the military were the real John Wains, okay?
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.760]  So corrupt people were threatened by it.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.240]  So they learned to use TV to make the world however they wanted.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:52.360]  Notice TV has now turned the world, the sick culture of Hollywood is turning the whole
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.360]  world into Hollywood.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.880]  So I've kind of made the point, but get into the book of the specifics, because you're
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.200]  making some great points, Connor.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.200]  Hey, Alex.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:03.480]  So essentially what the book is called is Confession, trust me, I'm lying, Confessions
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:05.200]  of a Media Manipulator.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.440]  So what he talks about in this book, you kind of just touched on.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:13.480]  The concept of how TV became this reflection of society.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:20.400]  So when TV was this new medium that was being made, it was essentially, it was fluid.
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:24.160]  They didn't really know what to do with it when they first started making it.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.560]  And they kind of had to just come up with ideas as to like, create something that mails
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.240]  a reflection of reality in society.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:37.240]  And as they kind of started to polish this out over time, they eventually started to
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:42.760]  kind of figure out how to fine tune television as an accurate reflection of society.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:47.840]  But over time, as society became more and more dependent on television, and it started
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:53.440]  to become more engaged with it, and it became the predominant medium in society as the go-to
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.480]  place for entertainment information, over time society started to reflect what television
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:36:59.480]  was.
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:04.680]  And so now when you look into kind of flash forward to the modern day where we're at now,
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:10.120]  now he takes the internet as a very similar analogy as to when the internet was first
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.920]  created, it was kind of just this mess of information, you know, like websites where
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.640]  you don't know how to find them.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:17.640]  Information was everywhere.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:20.440]  There was no real linear organization to it all.
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:21.440]  It was chaotic.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.440]  It was erratic.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:25.760]  But now, where things are kind of becoming more streamlined, more funneled down, we kind
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:33.120]  of have a more logical way of using the internet, well now it seems as though we as people are
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:43.960]  becoming a reflection of the internet, this erratic, short tempered, just like very, just
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.200]  our thought, our just our ability to...
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:49.640]  General illnesses exploding, the average attention span is 12 seconds.
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.640]  Yes.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.640]  That's what I'm trying to get at here.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:55.200]  The attention span has just been diminished ridiculously because of that, and that's exactly
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.800]  what the internet has done to us.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:01.720]  So yeah, you made those points earlier about what TV is doing, and it's just, I thought
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.720]  I just found it fascinating.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:04.720]  I just wanted to spill that out on you, Derek.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:07.880]  Well, Connor, you're always saying really smart stuff, so Zach, so's everybody back
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:08.880]  there.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.600]  So anytime you guys are trying to tell me a great point, I always say, take the real
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.880]  world and put it out there.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.720]  These great discussions, the great energy we burn, I mean, it's a great...
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:23.040]  We ought to put live cameras out there sometime, and just have a reality TV show of what's
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.560]  happening out there.
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.120]  Because that's where you get to see everything, the research, what we're doing.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.240]  But imagine to the fakes in the corporate media, they think we sit around in boardrooms
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.840]  and go, let's say Sandy Hook didn't happen and hurt people's feelings, we'll make lots
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:43.320]  of money off of that, no, we lost money doing it, just like saying 9-11's an inside job
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.760]  investigated, it didn't mean radical Islam wasn't real, it meant there were stand downs
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.000]  and that's now been proven.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:54.640]  I lost almost all my radio stations, 70-plus beautiful radio stations, a lot of them huge.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:58.720]  I went from, I mean, I lost millions because I told the truth, but they want to steal my
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:05.880]  identity and say, I'm going to say this, it's incredible, it's absolutely insane.
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.400]  But it shows, I think the bottom has dropped out and because of the radicalness on TV,
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:13.280]  all the murder, all the death, all of it, it's also blurred reality with fantasy and
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:18.120]  people are just conditioned now to not value the basic underpinning of what built this
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.120]  society.
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:25.200]  Tom, we're going to go to John here, tell us about John because you know John as well,
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:29.320]  it's this great community out there and what he did and then we'll go to John.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:33.160]  Well it does just fascinate me, every patriot, it seems like if you're doing this long enough
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.160]  you meet each other.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.880]  So I've known John on Facebook for a couple years now, I've known that he is a real whiz
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.680]  when it comes to programming as a software engineer by trade, working at kind of a high
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:47.480]  profile place, which I think is why he doesn't want it to get out.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.400]  And he just kind of said a few months ago on Veterans Day weekend, in fact, I think
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:55.360]  I want to make an Info Wars app for Roku, I think that would be fun, I could lay in
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:00.760]  bed and watch Info Wars, it'll be cool, it'll be perfect HD, people without good TV reception
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:04.400]  won't have to worry about getting a high power antenna, putting it on a 20 foot pole, I'm
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.400]  going to do this.
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:09.240]  So we sat down, he started figuring out you know how he was going to do it, what the approval
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:13.680]  process looked like, he discovered of course that Roku already had an Info Wars app which
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:18.280]  he took as an indication that the platform valued freedom of speech and he got his wife
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.040]  to make some graphics, it looked really slick, you've been showing some of those screenshots
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:26.440]  I know that we posted to bigleaguepolitics.com and took them about two and a half, three
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:32.200]  months they got it done, it worked fantastically, Roku actually tested the app, watched you
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:37.720]  live so they knew what it was and everything looked to be great of course until yesterday
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:42.920]  about what, 10 o'clock in the morning when the left wing outrage machine started, so
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:47.320]  I kind of feel bad for John because he was just trying to do a good thing and now I know
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.440]  he feels kind of like he's hurt Info Wars because he got your other one banned, but
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.160]  I know he's just a brilliant patriot, he was trying to do his best.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:41:00.480]  Oh absolutely and so the app was born on January 14th, 2019, it died on January 15th, killed
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:08.080]  by leftist outrage mobs, run by CNN, the Washington Post and PR operatives, the Democratic Party,
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.640]  just out there engaged in total disinformation, but we salute John, no no no, I mean he got
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.920]  in the ring, he did a great job and something about engineers and software people, I have
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:24.840]  a sneaking suspicion that the mother of invention is necessity and so I think we're the doers,
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:27.160]  you know not the people that pull things down, I think this is going to blow up in their
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.680]  face, John good to have you on and thanks for building the app, even though it only
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:34.160]  lived one day, it did shoot to the front page trending towards number one, so you know
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:37.440]  your baby lived one day but it was a beautiful baby.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:43.000]  Thank you Alex for having me on, it's been quite a surreal experience in just a few hours.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.280]  You know I always talk too much so I ran over about to go to break, but just in 60 seconds
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.800]  what spurred you to do this?
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:54.240]  After Info Wars got banned off YouTube, I started to realize that there really wasn't
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:00.800]  a place for anyone to watch Info Wars and I knew about the Roku app and you guys launched
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:05.680]  some new shows last year and I wanted to make those available, I enjoyed the War Room and
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:11.680]  David Knight show as well, so I decided I thought a few months about building this app
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:17.480]  shortly after August and then you know I saw your Info Wars live app get banned as well
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:21.640]  and then I realized there's collusion between Google and Apple and that they're really going
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:28.200]  after these platforms strategically trying to ban you, so that was really the trigger
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.080]  that made me do it.
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:35.000]  I was actually streaming Info Wars on YouTube for a little while before I got banned on there
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  as well, so this was the idea of something that could be permanent but it apparently
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  didn't last.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.960]  And now the controlled fascist left has gone from denying that they censor to just saying
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:52.640]  ban everyone in just an arrogant, power-mad lust with the blood of censorship fresh in
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.480]  their greedy wolf-like mouths, we'll be back.
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:00.800]  Defeat the globalist, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:04.360]  Defeat the pedophiles, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:09.320]  Defeat Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.

[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.240]  We've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.600]  you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.560]  I am patient zero in the massive banning but you can override the censors now and if all
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:31.960]  of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:37.640]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus, do it again with hashtag
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:42.720]  Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere, call and talk radio,
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:48.360]  c-span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones, that's the rallying cry to restore

[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:22.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:26.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:31.880]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:37.720]  Well, so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:42.360]  Now we've got a lot of exciting things we're working on right now, like just a little fire
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:48.040]  stick that you plug in your TV and you get all the Infowars broadcasts, everything.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:51.680]  This revolution towards everybody being able to have their own stick or their own Roku
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:56.400]  box and have the price down to where it's basically just the price of shipping is where
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.200]  it's going and that's where we're going.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:03.640]  But I love cloud TV, I love One American News, we're partnering with all these folks to stand
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.920]  up against the censorship because this country is in a real war, it's in a real fight and
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:14.360]  so many of the best journalists I know are liberals, they're not leftist, Prager University
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.480]  breaks that down.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.760]  They're classical liberals like Thomas Jefferson, like a Sandra Fairbanks, she's a big liberal,
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:26.120]  anti-war, all this other stuff like Rand Paul, but she's not a leftist, okay, and now she's
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.480]  fighting hard and being called a Nazi and stuff by the mainstream media.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.440]  And these people are the ones that are involved in the dissension, in the end fighting, in
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.880]  the racism, and America is getting sick and tired of it.
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:42.640]  This morning, I didn't get too hyper on air for some reason.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.640]  It's almost like a way I like power through it, but in the new studio I've been moving
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.400]  into it's a lot darker, for whatever reason it feels more like a radio studio, I'm a
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.040]  lot calmer in there, even seeing some of the reports.
[01:48:54.040 --> 01:49:00.160]  I shot about a 16 minute report this morning, that's my official statement on Roku and on
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:04.240]  Sandy Hook and it's going to be very important and I need your help folks, they will never
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.400]  let my statements get out, so they can keep lying about what I said and did, and that's
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:16.960]  why I have to make the Sandy Hook documentary now, I'm announcing that, about the event
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:23.320]  and about what came out of it and about the whole process of being persecuted around it
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.200]  and the disinformation and what I really said versus how they edited it and of course the
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:34.000]  film is going to be my defense and so I'm going to make the film and it will be put
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.680]  out there for everybody so people know the truth, but they plan to not just crucify
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:42.480]  me on this and make me die on this hill, they plan to destroy the entire First Amendment,
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:47.160]  so we're going to go back to John and again I'm not the technical guy, I saw a Facebook
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:52.000]  up there that looks like you could still I guess get the app that was on Roku or we'll
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.160]  see how John's going to fight back, I want to explain something.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:03.040]  People call me constantly or I get emails and customer service I hear, a man called
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:09.840]  and he wants to know, he owns 10 concrete trucks, this actually happened in Cleveland
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.880]  a couple months ago, he wants to know if he can paint infowars.com down the side and I
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.800]  get respecting somebody and all that, but we're an information operation, you can tattoo
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:22.480]  infowars on your wife's rear end if you want to.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:27.080]  My point is it's a symbol of rebellion against tyranny, a symbol of standing up for the unborn,
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.840]  a symbol of standing up for self defense, a symbol of standing up for free speech against
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:35.800]  bullies, the chai comms, the globalists, all of them, okay, so like it or not we become
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:40.960]  a symbol of this, we have to fight, we have to get into it and actually know it's a blessing.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:43.920]  This is going to backfire on them, the Lord works mysterious ways, it already has in
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.680]  many ways, so people call and say can I put infowars on the side of my barn, not just
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:55.440]  yes but hell yes, can I kiss your butt to do it, free to air everything, it's all free
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:59.280]  to air, you can do anything you want with our stuff, you don't think the Washington
[01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:04.120]  Post and the young turds and Megan Kelly when they edit my videos about Hillary killing
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:09.080]  kids in the Middle East, funding ISIS, turns it into killing kids in a pizza place, mixing
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:13.840]  two clips together, you don't think she has permission, that evil dumb witch that everybody
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:18.320]  hates now, she died on the hill trying to take me down, didn't she, politically.
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:23.560]  So we're in a war here folks, so you don't need my permission for Jack Squat, in fact
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:29.200]  I love GCN, I love Ted, but GCN is its own deal, we run obviously a more high-tech operation,
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.320]  out of niceness, I still let them carry it and they get half the commercials, it's a
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:38.280]  bad business decision, the one reason I may leave GCN and I let Ted know this is, I want
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:42.840]  to just give our radio stations all the ads, so I get more affiliates, you can just have
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:47.320]  them all and I'll do one plug an hour on air, I mean I've done a lot of innovating stuff
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:52.720]  and I want to do that, but my loyalty is my weakness sometimes, I love Ted to death, but
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:55.680]  I don't know, I already intended this year to, I don't know what I'm gonna do, the point
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:01.400]  is, air the sucker, do whatever you want with it, okay, I want to get the word out, I want
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:04.320]  to get around the censors period, now we're gonna go to our guest here and let him have
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:07.160]  the floor because I'm hyperventilating and out of control, we'll do five more minutes
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:11.800]  with Tom Papert in the next hour, TV station manager here, but people ask, how are you
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:16.800]  so excited, I have had one cup of coffee today, when this stuff happens I get energized man,
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:21.440]  they're taking our children's birthright, they're killing America in front of us, so
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:27.240]  if you're a radio listener, I have a hammer in my hand, a small sledgehammer, I don't
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:35.520]  know the technical name of this, a four-lib sledgehammer, four pound, an east wing, and
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:43.200]  I am going to smash the Roku commie stick, I'm not saying take away their free speech,
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:48.040]  I'm not saying I'm gonna shut them down, I wish no harm against them, I'm saying that
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:53.200]  you're smashing my free speech, you're out of my life, and everyone I know that knows
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:53:02.120]  you is going to have you out of their lives, Roku, so, it's fitting that you be destroyed,
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:07.240]  on top of a Roger Stone books, I don't smash the table, the Clinton war on women available
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:15.040]  at infowarstore.com, so, bye-bye to Roku, hello to cloud, ah, that didn't feel too good, can
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:20.000]  we bring it back up here one more time, please, am I having an assistant here, again, I'm
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.400]  not trying to break the table here, so I'm being, I'm being very, very judicious, no
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:30.640]  it's fine, can I just have the stick, thank you, I need to finish killing it, here we
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:34.760]  go ladies and gentlemen, I'm being judicious here, but I need to go ahead and act a little
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:42.320]  bit more manly and take this sucker out, close shot please for the money shot, alright, and
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:46.640]  now let's get the box, sorry that fell off again, will somebody bring me the box please,
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:52.120]  and then we'll, this time we'll smash it on Jeb and the Bush crime family, yes we will,
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:57.800]  we will take care of that for everyone right now, thank you very much, Daria, there you
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:03.400]  go, maybe we should have her do it, she's tougher than I am, here we go, there we go,
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:07.560]  let's see how it, how it, how it like that, I'm really not trying, little tough little
[01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:12.320]  bugger, sound like America, I wish Roku would have joined America, but it just can't seem
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:17.600]  to do it, that little sucker's tough to take out, I should be wearing safety glasses here
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:21.800]  and being more politically correct, because I'm not really even hitting it hard, so come
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:26.440]  here, I'll get you now, okay I'm getting mad now, I'm gonna get this guy, this sucker's
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:34.760]  tough, Roku you will pay, I tell ya it's harder than a jar of pickles, you what, I'm gonna
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:38.480]  use the backside of the hammer, well it is a little, little compound little sucker, I
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:42.320]  tell ya, Roku's almost as tough as the First Amendment, but you know they killed it, so
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.240]  maybe, maybe we can deal with them, there you go, right there ladies and gentlemen,
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:53.800]  say bye bye, that was a better idea, that got it, okay now it's been destroyed, that's
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:58.320]  just a primitive chimpanzee behavior, but it was fun to do, I'm gonna stop ranting
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:02.160]  now, I apologize for making you hold John, John how are you gonna fight back against
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:06.160]  this, is there a way to find the app that was known as the Roku app?
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:12.880]  Yes, actually, so there is a long process to get approved to be in the app store, but
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:18.200]  from the beginning there is always an option to have a non-certified Roku channel, and
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:24.840]  I was sharing that with friends in a beta test, and actually I put up a link, it's also
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:30.840]  on the Facebook page with the use app button, and that link will take you to your My Roku
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:36.040]  account, and once you log in you can add it, but you will also receive a message saying
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:41.200]  that this, the content may be offensive or inappropriate for some audiences, and that
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.640]  Roku doesn't condone it, I mean to be clear they never condone the content to begin with,
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:52.480]  they were very clear at the beginning to protect free speech, but it seemed like somebody,
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:56:00.760]  I mean the media was one thing, to have such a slew of articles trying to slander Roku
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:07.600]  over doing this, and them defending themselves, about midday, around six hours into it I think,
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:13.000]  they began to cave, and I think it had something to do with the Sandy Hook lawyer, because
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.200]  he's been referenced in a lot of these, and that's been at least articles, so anyway.
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:21.440]  Oh the Washington Post says, when we learned that Jones was sending people live time to
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:25.320]  their houses via the app, we had to stop him, which wasn't true, it's just totally made
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:31.360]  up, it's like, I was using it as a communication device to launch Sherman tanks, and Blitzkrieg
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:35.360]  armies, and so none of that's true, but that's how they got the immediacy of getting around
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:39.800]  the First Amendment of, he's sending people to the houses to stop him, which I didn't
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:40.800]  do.
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:47.720]  Exactly, and so I want to fight back on Roku, and maybe we can try to push them, I would
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:53.040]  encourage everybody to send emails to Roku, I think what they had trending was boycott
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:59.000]  Roku on Twitter yesterday, and I think we can easily take back that hashtag, and push
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.600]  back on our side, clearly Roku was afraid of that initially.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.120]  Well I'll tell you what's going to have to happen, you know you don't just think the
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.400]  lawyers are in the news saying, I'm actively sending people to the houses to arrest kids,
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:12.960]  whatever happened, certainly not happening now, you know then we've gotten the word,
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.560]  they're also threatening to sue people, or implying it, so I've got to file lawsuits,
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.920]  and it's happening, don't worry, it's 100% on, I've got to file a bunch of lawsuits
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:26.000]  now, just to get my name back, because this crap of them running around saying, Joseph's
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.960]  actively sending people to the houses right now, help us, oh god he's here, 9-1-1, Joseph's
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:38.120]  here, Roku, they're using you to attack us, help us, I mean it's just like, they're trying
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:43.120]  to create hysteria, but just wait, just wait, once these lawsuits are filed it'll be a whole
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:58:11.960]  of the world, stay right there, come back to you John.
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:40.440]  Well John, we have been here for about 1 hour right now.

[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:40.120]  watching on TV, I've got the four pound sledgehammer here, and I've already smashed the Roku device
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:43.280]  you can see right there, and oops, I missed.
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:53.880]  I missed my Hitler with it, it's a book about Hitler's granddaughter, and getting serious,
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:59.240]  the son of the top Nazi asset in the US, but I wish no harm upon him because they're
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:00.880]  already in hell.
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:04.240]  So we're done talking about that now, if you're a TV viewer and you saw that, if you're
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:05.400]  a radio listener, you didn't.
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:09.160]  Gentlemen, I am definitely in hyper mode right now, I was up at one in the morning working
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:10.160]  on this.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:14.240]  I was in the upper part on fire with his great work, how do we find more about you, John,
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:19.760]  the app developer now saying, hey, guess what, there's still an underground Roku app that
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:24.640]  hasn't been expunged yet, so gentlemen, closing comments, and I definitely want to get you
[02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:27.240]  both back on soon with updates.
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:31.360]  Well, Alex, I'm just glad I could come on and that I could help get this news out there.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:37.240]  You can find me on Facebook, I'm God Emperor Trump on Twitter at RealGETrump, and of course
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:42.200]  you can read my articles, I write two or three a day over at bigleaguepolitics.com, can't
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:44.120]  say enough nice things about them too.
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:49.080]  Yeah, they're awesome, and if I had the money, I'd hire you away and a few other people,
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:52.680]  but that's why I didn't plug the last two hours, except for one joke plug about Roger
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:55.680]  Stone's book, so that's why I guess if we won't be hiring, we might be laying people
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:56.680]  off at this rate.
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:01:57.680]  But God bless you.
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:01.560]  I may be cheaper than you think, but we've got to plug here, so I cannot say enough nice
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:03.880]  things about super male vitality right here.
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:05.440]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:07.960]  This is my favorite, it's heartbreaking that it's going away.
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:08.960]  I really think.
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:14.680]  I mean, Alex, I don't know how much you want to plug, but I think this is single-handedly
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:19.920]  responsible for losing about 70 pounds in six months, so thank you, Alex, for providing
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:20.920]  me such an order.
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:21.920]  Let's start over, and then I'll go to break.
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:22.920]  Stop, because I interrupted you.
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:23.920]  John, stay there.
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:24.920]  We'll come back and break.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:28.920]  This woman at break, but Tom, do a plug for us, we'll make it an ad, we'll make it a two
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:29.920]  minute ad.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:33.880]  So go ahead and start over, because I notice you've lost a ton of weight, and I was guessing
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:35.920]  that's what super male vitality does.
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.480]  It's just that we can't get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, and so I got put over a barrel
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:42.640]  cost-wise, too, so I just continued it.
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:43.640]  But tell us about it.
[02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:44.640]  That's why you've got this one.
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:45.920]  Well, I mean, really, it's true.
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:50.160]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here, Alpha Power,
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:54.320]  Super Male Vitality, they have given me the energy that I did not have.
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:57.540]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before.
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:00.960]  With these two here, I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:05.400]  working, at the end of doing a broadcast, I have the energy to go to a gym, and frankly,
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:08.280]  I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:11.880]  It's heartbreaking that super male vitality is about to go away, and again, it's just
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:15.640]  because you can't find the herbs, and you don't want to sell us crap, but that's what
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:16.640]  it's all about.
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.920]  This is the real deal.
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:21.680]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day, and all of a sudden, it's like, whoa,
[02:03:21.680 --> 02:03:22.680]  I'm a man again.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:27.560]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed
[02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:28.560]  me of.
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:29.560]  It's back.
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:32.360]  With that, I've got my X2 right here.
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:33.360]  Everything else I've tried.
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:37.680]  I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought for my family.
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:40.260]  Everybody loves everything in the InfoWare store.
[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:41.800]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:42.880]  You're supporting the show.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.360]  You're supporting the InfoWare, and really, as conservatives, who are you going to give
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  your money to?
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.680]  Are you going to go to the supplement store and give it to somebody who probably advertises
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:56.160]  on Roku, or are you going to give your money directly to Alex Jones?
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:58.640]  It's an easy choice, I think.
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:03.120]  These are exciting times we live in, and yes, super male vitality or female vitality
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.400]  is an aging process.
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.400]  It's cold-pressed.
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:10.280]  It takes three to four times more of the herbs to do it, and then it's got to basically
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:13.760]  do its own fermentation is the way they describe it.
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:16.920]  It's super, super strong for libido, stamina, energy.
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:20.880]  When I first heard about it six, seven years ago that was being developed, and I actually
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:26.080]  tried it, I was like, okay, this actually works, and I mean, I was big like you were.
[02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:30.920]  I'm still a big guy, but I mean, I lost 60, 70 pounds with the X2, and with the super
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:31.920]  male vitality.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.680]  I mean, I was getting up there close to 300 pounds, folks, to me.
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:37.080]  I'm kind of little at 230, 240.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:40.480]  I've gained a few pounds back because I barely work out anymore, and if I wasn't taking it
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:46.040]  and wasn't taking the X2 and X3, I would definitely be pushing 300 pounds right now.
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:50.800]  So get your super male vitality, the final run, unless me squeezing them makes me down
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:51.800]  on the price.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:52.800]  So get it today while you still can.
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:05:00.160]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:05.360]  full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:10.480]  It literally dumps the population down, and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:15.200]  the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:19.320]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:23.960]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:26.120]  nascent iodine, and brought you X2.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:27.120]  That's been incredible.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:32.520]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:37.240]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists, and others showed
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:42.240]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:48.800]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:51.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:52.880]  discovery.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:06:22.600]  I'm Alex Jones and I'll see you next time on X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:32.040]  I got to tell you, I love old Wayland Jennings, the rest of the outlaw country, but they were
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:38.000]  outlaw country talking about girls and smoking a little marijuana.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.480]  You don't get more outlaw than in full wars, and I don't say that with, well, I do say
[02:06:42.480 --> 02:06:43.480]  with pleasure.
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:49.000]  I mean, if we're going to be put through this stuff, we might as well wear this uniform
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.960]  with pride, and that's what it comes down to, because when you die, folks, you don't
[02:06:53.960 --> 02:06:56.440]  want to have the shadows taller than your soul.
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:01.560]  Some measurement of who you are, where God decides to send you to a place where you belong.
[02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:05.800]  Through this, God doesn't even really send you to hell, in my view, you just go where
[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:07.280]  you chose to go.
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:11.000]  At the last minute, you're not allowed to get out of that decision you made, those decisions
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.560]  are final and eternal.
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:17.280]  So, if you just joined us, one of the top stories of the country, yesterday and today,
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:21.720]  Alex Jones banned, nobody called me for a request, no one got my statements, they just
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:24.440]  lied about what I'd said and done and called me to be banned.
[02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:29.400]  But the answer is not just in full wars.com, not just our radio and TV stations, but all
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:34.640]  of you out there, start your own shows, but also boycotting Roku, boycotting these other
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:36.680]  places that censor and do all this.
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:41.800]  So, Tom Pappert manages one of our great TV stations that were on across the country,
[02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:45.160]  and so tell folks about that station and how they find it, Tom.
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:50.840]  So locally in Wichita, you're on KCTO 5.4, and if you've got an antenna, you've got
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:57.200]  5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, so nowadays, you've still got the same number of channels, but there's
[02:07:57.200 --> 02:08:01.760]  patriots who own low-power TV stations out there, where they're going to put on infowars.
[02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:05.240]  They might put on Russia today, they might put on Newsmax.
[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:10.240]  It's a whole new renaissance, really, of local TV getting back down, it used to be back to
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:14.480]  what it meant in the 50s, and you had Connor on earlier in the show, talking about what
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.640]  TV used to be, and how it used to be that TV was just a representation of society.
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:23.200]  And I think that's what we're getting back to with stuff like infowars.
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:26.400]  I mean, Alex, you're a man in Texas telling it like it is.
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:32.800]  How much more American, how much more reflective of the real America can you get than infowars?
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:37.160]  The most censored, the most feared, the most hated by the globalist program out there.
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:39.840]  It's really exciting stuff, I think.
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:40.840]  It is.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.360]  Texas is exploding, RT's good because you'll get a different perspective, but it's not
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:49.200]  pro-Russia, it's kind of leftist sometimes, but it's RT America, but it doesn't matter.
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:54.600]  It gives people that choice, and if you're watching on local TV, tell people about it.
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:59.600]  The power of word of mouth is the ultimate game changer, I mean, obviously under God,
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:01.560]  but God's the ultimate game changer.
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.160]  Under that word of mouth taking action.
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:04.160]  Tom, great job.
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:05.160]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:06.160]  Thank you for spending an hour with us.
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:07.840]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:08.840]  I look forward to it.
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:09.840]  Thank you.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:16.040]  John, the developer of the app that shot up the charts to the front page of Roku.
[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:17.040]  Everybody loved it.
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.040]  It was working great.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.040]  Super professional.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:20.040]  Thanks for building it for us.
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.040]  It was your idea.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.040]  We weren't even officially involved.
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:23.760]  I just said, absolutely do it.
[02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:24.760]  You did it.
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.040]  It shot up the charts to the front page in which they admit it was very popular.
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:32.000]  The left saw it on the front page, had heart attacks, and about six hours after it was
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:39.320]  banned using fake information that I was sending, you know, armed vigilantes, basically.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:44.360]  You know, dangerous people to harass people in Connecticut, which I never did, and I did
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:45.760]  not do yesterday.
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:46.760]  And I'm not doing.
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:47.760]  I mean, that's insane.
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:51.720]  That's Facebook sending antifa to people's houses to say they're going to kill them.
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.480]  And then, of course, they get praised for that.
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:55.480]  That's not what we do.
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:10:00.800]  But just other points you want to add and what you see this as, I see it as a bellwether.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:04.880]  And I think boycotting these groups is good as libertarians, as conservatives, as just
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:05.880]  free speech advocates.
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:11.360]  And also what you did, innovating new platforms, doing new things, and never giving up.
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:16.000]  Yeah, I think this is definitely a sign of the times.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.800]  We've heard about recent information about News Guard strategies like that, where they're
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:23.040]  trying to put things on a device level.
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:26.400]  We're just now starting to see the next level of censorship.
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:32.000]  I understand Facebook is using artificial intelligence now to identify memes, even when
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.240]  they're changed, where they can tag those Snopes articles at the bottom of it.
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.200]  And as far as TV streaming devices go, I didn't even know about Cloud TV.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:43.480]  I would support it.
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:46.120]  I definitely encourage people to go out there and get it.
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.280]  We're still going to try to keep this Roku app available as long as we can.
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:54.640]  And there's also another platform called Kodi K-O-D-I.
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:57.280]  It's an open source TV streaming platform.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:04.200]  I understand that somebody built an M4s plug-in for it a number of years ago, around 2015.
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.840]  There's a GitHub with source code, so I'm going to look into developing that and see
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:12.880]  if we can develop something very similar that's running on open source platforms.
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:16.400]  It runs on Raspberry Pi as equipment.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:20.360]  So there's a lot of things we can do to try to bring this to the masses, but it's definitely
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.920]  a sign of the times.
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:26.360]  What was it like, because I didn't have time to get into the whole process.
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:28.880]  I just remember Zimmerman asked me months ago, hey, there's these great guys, they want
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:29.880]  to do something.
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:30.880]  They're going to put this together.
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:31.880]  They said, OK.
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:32.880]  And I said, absolutely.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:33.880]  It's not just OK.
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:36.880]  I mean, I'll kiss their hand, kiss the ring here.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:40.440]  But what was it like to build it, to do it, to have your wife help you, I know?
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:45.120]  And then to just see it, super popular Russian, the top, like our Apple app, went to number
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:48.440]  one in news, and then they go, this is bad.
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:49.640]  We decide you don't get it.
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:53.200]  I mean, it's one thing if they delete something that is a crap app or is a scam.
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:57.720]  But when it's number one, or it shoots the top, people inherently don't like winners
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:59.720]  being held back.
[02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:03.640]  Yeah, I was really taken aback by it.
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:08.040]  I'd actually had gone out for a bit, and Tom was out promoting the app, and I came back
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:11.200]  to my computer, and he said, people are saying there's a problem with the app.
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:12.440]  They're getting this error message.
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:13.440]  Can't find it.
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:17.520]  It was still listed in the store, but once they tried to install it, it was giving an
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:18.520]  error.
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:20.480]  I mean, I thought I accidentally deleted it or something.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:23.640]  I had never thought that it would happen this quickly.
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:24.880]  I had saw the ratings.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:28.680]  We had seven ratings, and the average was 4.4 stars.
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:33.440]  It was doing really well, and it was a really great experience, very educational, to learn
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:39.160]  the Roku platform, the bright script programming language that it runs on, and I had a lot
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:45.160]  of faith in Roku, but that's been lost, and I understand they were just under pressure,
[02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:48.000]  but we can't continue to allow this to happen.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.040]  We have to, as conservatives, get a backbone and start standing up to it, and my call to
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:58.720]  technical people, professionals, programmers, is to start getting creative about how you
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:05.160]  can be a part of this as well, and it's going to take a team of people who are dedicated
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:08.680]  and skilled to fight back against this technocratic censorship.
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:13.440]  Well, that's right, and the Washington Post and their Times both say what took it over
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.440]  the top was.
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:18.240]  The company said, we've monitored it, we're not seeing anything illegal.
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:22.600]  I mean, we're mild compared to MSNBC saying kill the president and all this stuff.
[02:13:22.600 --> 02:13:23.600]  We don't call for violence.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.600]  Everybody knows that.
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:25.600]  We don't call for offense to violence.
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:29.880]  Somebody starts a fight, take it to them 100%, and get them out of your way, your family's
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:34.200]  way, but it was the lawyers, and from the Sandy Hook families, who are obviously your
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:38.280]  political operatives, Democrats, they admit that, they say we want him off the air.
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:39.280]  He's harassing the families.
[02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:40.560]  He won't stop sending people here.
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:44.400]  He's doing it currently, and they went really, and they said he's doing it currently.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:52.760]  Which, I never did it, and so it was that system-wide claim that I was using the platform
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:14:00.000]  for something I wasn't, and they have engaged in that, and it's very dastardly.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.920]  It's very wicked, and I'm going to stand up to it, and I think people are going to understand
[02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:10.440]  that this is wrong, to keep saying things in my name that I didn't say, and then even
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:14.360]  when I say, hey, I didn't say that, please stop, they go, no, we're going to keep saying
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:19.120]  it, it's just a new level, and just because the mainstream media backs these people doing
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:21.640]  it, it's despicable.
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:26.080]  It's important to note that there was a slew of articles, I mean, we just did a Duck Duck
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:32.760]  Go search for Roku Alex Jones to try to get a pulse on what was happening in the timeline,
[02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:36.800]  and I mean, articles going back 10, 11 hours prior, and this was at 8 o'clock when we were
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:41.360]  looking at it, it showed a timeline where they were writing articles in TechCrunch and
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:47.040]  Mashable and the Hollywood Reporter saying, you know, you're trying to slander Roku for
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:51.240]  supporting the app and Roku defending it, and they just kept trying to make an example
[02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:52.240]  out of them.
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:58.080]  So, I mean, does the conservative press have, you know, a similar type of army of journalists
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:14:59.320]  that can fight back?
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.240]  I think that's what we need as independent journalists and other people to create their
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:08.040]  own shows, so we have a similar platform, but, you know, it's gotten into the New York
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:10.440]  Times, Washington Post has an article this morning.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:15.120]  Listen, and they all get republished, thousands of articles total globally right now.
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:18.480]  It's all over TV, and they get to piggyback more lies.
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:22.640]  Jones was sending people to their houses right now, and so again, they piggyback all those
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:27.080]  lies on there, and then they set the precedent to get these organized brigades of leftists
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:31.320]  to go out and basically burn down other free speech institutions.
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:36.760]  They're building an aggressive, hateful army, and they are bullies, the very definition
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:37.760]  of it.
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:39.600]  All right, God bless you, John.
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:40.600]  Keep it up.
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:41.600]  We really appreciate it.

[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:48.520]  I guess that's where they can find what you guys have put up to get the Roku app that's
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:49.520]  underground.

[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:59.960]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:00.960]  the world.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:04.000]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:09.920]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:13.720]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:14.720]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:16.280]  Who do we fight for?

[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:25.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:29.760]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:31.320]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:34.280]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:37.560]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.800]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:41.120]  I can help you too.

[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:13.200]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:17.200]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:25.520]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:31.720]  Harping on wars, we fight and griping about the great things of the big.
[02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:40.160]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up to things they believe in.
[02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:47.520]  Running down my country, man, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:56.200]  Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me, running down the way to life, I fight and
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:21:00.040]  then fall to die to be.
[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:07.920]  If you don't love it, leave it, let this song I'm singing be a warning.
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:14.920]  You're running down my country, man, you're walking on the fighting side of me.
[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:15.920]  We are back.
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:19.680]  Thought Old Murrell Haggard, God bless his soul.
[02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:22.680]  He left us to be with the Lord in 2018.
[02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:23.680]  Listen to this.
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:32.680]  I read about some squirrely guy who claims he just don't believe in the fight.
[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:38.240]  And I wonder just how long the rest of us can count being free.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:40.240]  They love our milking honey.
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:47.720]  They love our milking honey, but they preach about some other way of living.
[02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:55.320]  And they're running down my country, horse, they're walking on the fighting side of me.
[02:21:55.320 --> 02:22:04.000]  Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me, running down the way to life, I'm fighting
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.640]  and it's hard to turn off Old Murrell Haggard, isn't it?
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:11.480]  If you don't love it, leave it, let this song I'm singing be a warning.
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:14.200]  If you don't love it, leave it, let this song I'm singing be a warning.
[02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:16.880]  But you were running down to be with the Lord in 2018.
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:25.040]  He was born, and the memory serves in a railway car during the big dust bowl when the Pan
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:30.880]  Handle of Texas and Oklahoma collapsed and all the topsoil blew away because they were
[02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:32.520]  over farming.
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:39.400]  And he was born in a railway car that they had in Hobo, people knew people were getting
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:43.480]  on them to go to California where they could be farmers.
[02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:49.080]  And he was born, I think the one account I read was right as they were going over the
[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:53.720]  California line in the boxcar.
[02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:58.040]  So the oaky from Muscogee was actually born in California.
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:03.960]  And then we still flow glory down at the courthouse and the White Lightning is still the greatest
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:04.960]  thrill hall.
[02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:09.920]  I remember growing up, my family being proud of me in Texas and proud of me in hardworking
[02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:13.840]  and proud of America, and I thought it was obnoxious, like kind of an elitism.
[02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:17.640]  It wasn't an elitism, since my parents weren't elitist, my family wasn't elitist, they were
[02:23:17.640 --> 02:23:21.040]  nice, good Christian people, but it was because they knew people had been trying to take it
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:22.040]  away from us.
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:24.400]  And that was their identity.
[02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:28.800]  And I grow up and I see these globalists how much they hate this country, how they want
[02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:29.800]  to run on the ground.
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:31.680]  You better damn believe they're your enemy.
[02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:34.720]  You better damn believe the New York Times, the Washington Post, are they going to be
[02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:35.960]  the American people?
[02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:39.280]  And they're getting ready to false flag themselves because Trump says that, no, look, you made
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:40.280]  us get attacked.
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:42.080]  No, you'll attack your own damn cells.
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:43.080]  We all know that.
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:44.080]  You scum.
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.400]  They're private intelligence agencies.
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:51.520]  They're all about your cowards and yes man who line up and kiss the ass of corrupt lawyers
[02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:57.600]  and corrupt FBI agents that are all a bunch of candy asses and all fake and all followers.
[02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:04.560]  And that's what it comes down to in the final equation.
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:07.200]  And I'm not saying all the FBI agents are bad, not to kiss their ass.
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:08.200]  It's the truth.
[02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:11.440]  Some of the best people are FBI agents, but the people at the top that the Clintons put
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:16.240]  in are the scum of the earth.
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:20.880]  I've known FBI agents, grew up around some of them, good Christian, hardworking, boy scout,
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:25.320]  you know, 20 hours a day on cases, but those are the guys they've got doing bank robberies
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:27.920]  and child kidnapping.
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:31.880]  They got a bunch of scumbag lawyers up top running these things and man, they are the
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:38.000]  biggest group of Eddie Haskell jerks the planet's ever seen.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.240]  You know, I'm going to get to these videos next segment because I've started pontificating
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:42.240]  here.
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:46.280]  We've got a lady flipping out in the local area pulling down Alchone sign somebody put
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:49.120]  up somebody caught it and just how crazy she is.
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:52.480]  Amazing. We're going to play that. There's this Washington Post thing I mentioned, the
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:57.560]  case for banning Alex Jones, that is amazing.
[02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:02.000]  We're going to play that video.
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:09.880]  And we're going to get ready for the next host to come over and take over Roger Stone.
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:12.280]  And there's a lot of other news I didn't hit.
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:15.120]  And quite frankly, I opened the show with what we probably should have talked about
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:23.960]  the whole time, because it's a big deal when Sean Hannity gets up on television and word
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:28.680]  for word says what I've said about the ongoing live coup against the president.
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:33.240]  You know, media matters grabs it and goes, look, Sean Hannity's channeling Alan Jones.
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:38.640]  Sean Hannity's plagiarizing no, Sean Hannity works like 14 hours a day and I know he watches
[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:42.520]  some of the show and I'm going to leave it at that and you know, I'm going to leave it
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:46.720]  at that. And I know that he gets info wars now in the last four or five years and four
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:50.800]  or five years ago, he started getting info wars and understood our perspective because
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:54.800]  he was such a Boy Scout, he didn't believe all this dirt and stuff before.
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:26:00.680]  He thought I was exaggerating or making it up now. He's like, Oh, now I see why I came
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:04.280]  towards Hannity and he came towards me because I was younger and didn't know a lot of stuff.
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.840]  He was older, knew a lot of things, but he was also naive.
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:10.800]  And so I figured out I wasn't right about everything, but he was naive and we were pretty
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:13.960]  much on the same page now.
[02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:19.960]  But to have him with, let me tell you, Nielsen scams anybody that's a patriot. The word is
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:23.560]  it's eight million viewers a night, not, not, not five million. That's double that dumb
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:28.800]  ass Maddow. And Nielsen's been caught faking ratings for leftist many times. They've been
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:34.800]  caught. It's a fraud. Okay. Just like these polls, shock polls, Alexandra Cortez, you
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:40.920]  know, shock poll, Alexandra Cortez tied with Trump and polls. Hillary was 30 something
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:46.640]  points ahead the week of the election. According to CNN, those polls don't mean a damn thing
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.960]  except a weak minded people.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:53.960]  So what am I getting at here? The fact that Hannity in the article in the videos posted
[02:26:53.960 --> 02:27:01.000]  on info wars.com comes right out and says there's an active coup against the president
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:12.560]  and then in 13 minutes, the first segment, he lays it out in solid country gold. I mean,
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:19.120]  to quote a great country artist, the voice coming out of those speakers was solid country
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:23.880]  gold. You should probably come in with that song. I'm about to get on the country music
[02:27:23.880 --> 02:27:32.760]  kick. See, I'm in a good mood right now, actually. So that gets me listening to country music.
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:41.880]  Man, I want to be riding around a truck somewhere out on the Ponderosa. You know, we still got
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:45.640]  a piece of the Ponderosa out in East Texas, a piece of the land we used to have. We used
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:50.960]  to be land barons, pretty much had family involved in a bunch of stuff and the founding
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:57.960]  of Texas railroads. Family had a spur of a railroad. Pretty wild stories too, about
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:03.120]  the 10 years occupation, reconstruction. Those aren't stories, though you're going to get
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:06.880]  in the history books because the history books are full of lies, ladies and gentlemen, all
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:07.880]  lies.
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:12.800]  So when we come back, a self-identified member of Berkeley, Antifa was caught tearing down
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:16.600]  flyers featuring Laura Loomer and Alex Jones outside Twitter, San Francisco, California
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:29.040]  headquarters. Her reason? There's no free speech for Nazi punk. And listen, Goblin Watch,
[02:28:29.040 --> 02:28:34.160]  can we cue up the original Goblin in Seattle? When Goblin's attacked and we actually put
[02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:43.160]  the literal vampire potbelly, Goblin's coming after you? I mean, there's nothing like a
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:51.480]  low IQ slobbering Goblin coming for your first amendment. Look, we will beat these people,
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:55.440]  but you understand this is just a victim right here.

[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:28.920]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to
[02:29:28.920 --> 02:29:33.720]  seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:37.760]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:41.760]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you
[02:29:41.760 --> 02:29:45.760]  owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:56.280]  tax case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com, that's DanPilla.com, DanPilla.com.
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:00.660]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[02:30:00.660 --> 02:30:05.360]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:11.760]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:16.960]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:21.840]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer. It is a classical 360
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:26.160]  win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we
[02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:31.440]  believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:35.560]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of
[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:40.560]  this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as
[02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:45.840]  you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:49.680]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:53.480]  your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies

[02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:25.280]  patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the sensors now, and if all of
[02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:30.560]  our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together. We've
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:36.640]  already changed the world together with our laser focus. Do it again with hashtag Alex
[02:32:36.640 --> 02:32:41.280]  Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere. Call and talk radio,
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:47.000]  c-span, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones. That's the rallying cry to restore
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:59.400]  the First Amendment. Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:25.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:34.760]  Would you like to ride? Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:56.720]  front lines of the Info War. It's a little bit more of this. This is what they've turned
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:34:12.880]  people into. This is it, right here. A literal slave of the system. See that? That's who they
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:24.880]  are. Look at this slave. That was great. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. I know. I'm proud
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:36.480]  of you. That is kind of a version by David Allen Coe of Crazy Outlaw Guy. Obviously crazier,
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:41.400]  you know what? But kind of a version of it's a long way to the top if you want to rock
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:48.640]  and roll by ACDC. This is where you get off, boy. Because I'm going to Alabama. As I stepped
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:56.320]  out of that Cadillac, I said, Mr. Many Things. He said, you don't have to call me Mr. Mr.
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:04.800]  The whole world called me high. He said, can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:10.400]  Have you paid your dues? Can you mourn the blues? Can you bend them guitar strings? That's
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:13.920]  enough. I'm going to get out of the country music. I'm going to start listening all day.
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:18.880]  You know, Keith Whitley, though, is, because I love George Strait. He's probably my favorite.
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:23.720]  But Keith Whitley, I wish he'd have lived longer because every song he did is excellent. Raging
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:29.120]  alcoholic, madman, real Dukes of Hazard type stuff, you know, in Kentucky, jumping cars
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:37.920]  off cliffs and everything. I mean, he was nuts. He's the only music where if I listen
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:44.720]  to it, it, it then plays in my head with fidelity. Like other songs you can kind of hear them
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:48.480]  in your head if you want to. With Keith Whitley, I can't get it out of my head and I can't stop
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:56.240]  listening to it. Gosh, it's bad. Do we play a Keith Whitley song right now? Wouldn't that just be better?
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:06.240]  It's amazing. Listen to it for a second, but get me off here for a minute.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:16.240]  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:26.240]  It's the best part right here.
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:36.240]  It's the best part right here.
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:02.240]  That's not even one of the best Keith Whitley songs.
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:06.240]  Hey, you say it best.
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:21.840]  You know, when the listeners thank me for how great I am, you understand the whole
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:27.920]  reason we're here with you. I mean, you're like 99.99% of it. It's a, it's a sick joke.
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:32.320]  Thank yourself and thank God. And I want to thank you. It's the same thing. And I know
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:36.960]  you want to thank me, but you want to thank me and I thank you by taking action. Let's take
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:42.560]  action. Let's get serious. Like Laura Loomer going and taking illegal aliens to Nancy Pelosi's house.
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:46.320]  They tried to ignore it. It blew up big. That's action. I admire her.
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:51.760]  And, you know, then I see Annie Semites out there because she's Jewish, putting her down.
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:56.480]  You know, that's a load of crap. She's fighting the globalist agenda. There are globalist Jews.
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:01.200]  There's anti-globalist Jews. There's Kami Jews. There's Christian Jews. There's just like there's
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:08.000]  everything. There's Kami Blacks, Patriot Blacks. It's people, man. You know, the left claims,
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.960]  they're all about everybody being together, but all they tell you is what color you are,
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:14.640]  where you're from, what you're doing. And then they bring in people they've weaponized
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:18.320]  so that those of us are the most open society in the world. Got to feel like we're the bad guys
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:25.200]  and done something wrong. I'm done. And I wasn't intimidated by him, but I got to tell you this
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:30.000]  latest line they crossed. I just hope I can stay in this place. I am forever now because
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:35.760]  it's not an arrogance. It's not even a confidence. It's a commitment. And
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:42.960]  I just got like a whole bunch of clicks closer to God in the last 24 hours.
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:47.200]  I think everybody, I was talking to Kit and other people I know, and they're like,
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:51.280]  are you feeling this? I was talking to a neighbor this morning and they're like,
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:54.560]  you know, I'm excited. I didn't used to really believe all what you say, but I just,
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:00.560]  I just last night had a dream and I just feel like those are the neighbors that like it was just,
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:04.560]  it was like an epiphany, but I just got closer to God and I'm looking at this neighbor
[02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:07.680]  and I had just told my wife that in the house 10 minutes before.
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:15.680]  And I'm telling you, there's an internet of minds. There's, there's an ether and it's happening.
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:22.400]  You felt it too, didn't you? Just pray that Christ spirit come into the earth
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:28.160]  because you know the earth from of the devil and we have free will, but we have to ask God in
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:36.480]  not just our hearts to into the planet and we have to do that. And you pray to ask God into
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:42.640]  the planet in the name of Jesus Christ. The enemy doesn't like that because we tell you Jesus Christ
[02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:48.720]  is real folks and this fight is real. I'm going to stop preaching. You know, I don't want to make
[02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:54.320]  fun of this lady, but you know, in the goblin video, we should probably show the whole thing
[02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:59.120]  sometime because like five people or six people had just said, F you F your family. I'm just trying
[02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:03.680]  to walk down the street in Seattle. He says a bunch of stuff, F you. So I run over to him and I
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:07.200]  say, well, here, tell me, because none of them will talk to me. They all go F you, F your family,
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:12.160]  because they hate families, don't have families. And then they run. What they mean is I hate your
[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:18.560]  life force. I hate you with God. And they always act the same. He throws hot coffee on me, which he
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:23.200]  just filled. It was called the hot coffee. Oh, it wasn't hot Jones, but me and a wimp. I mean,
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:26.480]  we got to feel good in the way because I'm the type of guy that eats pizza too hot and kind of like
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:32.400]  next day just pulls the skin off through their mouth. I'm kind of on the end or fall. But the
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:37.920]  point is, is that experiencing this, he's just one we caught on tape is everman. He's not a coward.
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:41.600]  He just didn't want to go outside the hotel anymore. Cause I mean, I'd walk five feet out the
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:49.760]  hotel and ask you to die. You piece of crap. Like, like, like, like zombies. Well, this latest video
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:58.400]  is another goblin sighting hobbling goblin stumbling around coming after me spirit gets close to it
[02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:06.240]  and just don't want to go there. So that big spot, this is, this is, this is not a bad person.
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:13.920]  Like it, the clown is just a tentacle of a big intergalactic spider down a mine shaft.
[02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:19.920]  And it's got its finger up in the clown is just its little manifestation of a tentacle,
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:27.360]  like an angler fish. So this poor woman is a captured spirit. And she's just stumbling around
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:32.320]  with pleasure, exercising her power to stop your speech. This is in San Francisco,
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:35.360]  Laura Lummer and Alex Jones signs hashtag Alex Jones. Here it is.
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:44.800]  Heavenly. Berkeley Antifa. What's that? You're talking to somebody that has
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:49.840]  had all five battles with Berkeley. I saw these. All right, what's your name?
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:56.720]  There's no free speech for Nazis. There's no free speech for Nazis.
[02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:00.000]  All people work. She's literally financed by Nazi.
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:04.640]  You're tearing down the picture of this Jewish lady. Nice try, buddy.
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:09.600]  Why is that? Nice try. You're not going to try. You're not going to do,
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:12.960]  you're not going to make this work, buddy. All right.
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:21.600]  And just that act of you going out and putting up an Alex Jones
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:25.840]  poster or whatever you want to defend is free speech. Go out, watch them attack,
[02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:30.480]  and then say, when they say Nazi, go really like George Sorrelson funds Antifa and his son,
[02:42:31.040 --> 02:42:36.560]  the Nazi clever and upload. And just every bit of that is what matters.
[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:42.560]  But again, she calls you a Nazi. She gets to humanize you. Hey lady, America beat the
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:47.360]  Nazis and another nation states like Russia, you don't sit there and call us Nazis.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.920]  We beat you. We beat your God Sorrows. We beat your Lord.
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:43:00.160]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:05.760]  run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk. Believe me, I know I spend hours in
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:10.480]  front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day. But thanks to super

[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:25.520]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours,
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:31.360]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park,

[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:58.240]  Super male vitality from infowarstore.com. Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:03.920]  is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates. But a lot of us on the big island rely
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:10.400]  on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:16.640]  metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out,
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:23.360]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:29.520]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested the water
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:35.360]  from our Alexa pure gravity filter. And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:42.160]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure
[02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:48.320]  raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:54.080]  a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:45:04.640]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom. Our freedoms don't consist of the
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:08.000]  things that are enumerated on a piece of paper. It consists of the things that we're willing to
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:13.360]  fight for. The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:19.600]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:24.640]  from us as individuals. You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:31.760]  We have seen what they want to do. They called it UN Agenda 21. Now they call it the UN 2030
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:37.280]  Agenda. They want everybody off of the rural lands. They want people out of the suburbs. They want
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:43.200]  to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:45:43.200 --> 02:46:00.880]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:29.440]  If you leave me, if you leave me, I won't miss you, and I won't ever take you back.
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:35.040]  I won't ever take you back. This morning, I was thinking, and I thought,
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:42.480]  we need to hank Williams Jr., Jr., and we've got one, he's pretty wild, but what we really need
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:53.440]  is George Strait Jr. I guess his daughter played the guitar. She died in a car wreck at 13.
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:57.200]  She actually stalked these people. That's the last stalk. Not Hollywood or anybody else.
[02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:03.680]  The great thing about George Strait is, he seems like a cartoon because he sings so perfect,
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:08.480]  and the cowboy hat and all, but he's actually from South Texas, from a ranching family,
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:14.880]  army veteran, shelf-made, real McCoy, real deal, down to earth, greatest guy you could know.
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:20.480]  It's amazing. Isn't that cool? George Strait. Love him.
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:29.040]  Bubba Strait. There is a George Strait Jr. We just wish he was touring the nation because
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:34.080]  we need to clone George Strait, don't we? Because people all the world love George Strait. He's
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:37.360]  sold more than the Beatles, and you listen to that. It sounds like an art type of a country
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:39.600]  music singer. Like, it's just too good. Listen to it.
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:54.160]  See, you hear old Texas voices like that, and it sounds fake, except that's what my
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:59.120]  grandfather sounded like. They were gentlemanly, they talked pretty slow, they were nice,
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:06.880]  and they're gone. There aren't many more of those left. I'm more of a sped-up crazy Texan.
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:12.800]  Alright, I'm going to get off the subject. Let's get serious and get down to brass
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:15.120]  tax and what's happening in the world, and I'm going to host some of the next hour
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:17.440]  at Rogers County and get serious. There's a lot of stuff breaking, but
[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:26.640]  it's like the George Strait song. I saw God today. I had just a real refilling of the
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:32.240]  Holy Spirit this morning. The best I've ever had, and not the type of your crying on your
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:36.960]  knees, but the type of like, here's the big plan, buddy, and just like a big, warm blanket,
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:41.200]  we're going to win. I need more of those. You know what I mean? Talking about being a drug addict,
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:47.120]  people haven't been around God. He ain't been around nothing. Because once you get close to
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:51.280]  God, all you want to do is get closer to God. And if you even think about bad stuff,
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.600]  you feel yourself getting pulled away from God. That's called fearing God. You're not fearing
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:01.280]  God's going to do something to you. You're fearing separation from God. But see, the profane
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:05.840]  don't know what they're reading in the Bible. You have to experience them to then know how
[02:50:05.840 --> 02:50:15.600]  profound it is. Hell is separation from God. Death is separation from God. God, the big G.
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:19.520]  You want to know what came before all this? Only God knows.
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:26.880]  When all the secrets came out of here, God's mind. We're a dream of God.
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:36.240]  God dreams to build new universes. God dreams to have more great experiences
[02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:51.280]  and to see us transcend the fallen and create new worlds. Not just explore new worlds. We
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:57.840]  are master builders. Great architects. You know, the Luciferians go, oh, a Luciferian term.
[02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:04.480]  Lucifer is the great architect. No, God is the architect. Lucifer can't even read the plans.
[02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:13.920]  We can. And that's why we're hated by the enemy. You can read God's language. You can read master
[02:51:13.920 --> 02:51:23.120]  builder plans because you're in the first grade, ladies and gentlemen. First grade. Can you imagine
[02:51:23.120 --> 02:51:28.320]  12th grade? And then boot camp. And then you're like, whoa, this is what we're doing. Oh, get the
[02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:35.120]  fight. Let's go. But a boot camp like this, it might take a hundred million years, a hundred
[02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:40.400]  billion years. We don't know. I want to know. I want to be there with the awesome creator of all
[02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:47.600]  this and I'll do whatever it takes as weak as I am to get over that finish line. That means I'm
[02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:51.680]  tied up one day with those globalists pulling my guts out of my rear end. Their favorite thing
[02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:58.720]  is knock it out, baby. Knock it out. Let's go. Let's get it going here because you're going to
[02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:06.080]  go to your God. I'm going to go to mine. Know that forever. So let's get back to the sellouts.
[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:11.360]  Let's get back to the, the, the, the people that collaborate with the devil, the Washington Post.
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:15.440]  Here they are sniveling. So tone deaf. Whoever the sniveller is.
[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:21.600]  That, that article about the Washington Post here, here's the Washington Post sniveling.
[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:29.120]  The headline is a case for banning Alex Jones. Here it is. But he's a chaos candidate and he'd
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:37.840]  be a chaos president. In December 2015, Donald Trump was leading a very crowded field for the
[02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:47.360]  Republican presidential nomination. Trump agreed to go on to the Alice Jones program.
[02:52:52.560 --> 02:53:01.600]  Trump was able to gain access to the very intense following of Alex Jones' radio program,
[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:09.120]  a group of people who are very cynical about the United States government and might be inclined
[02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:15.360]  to support a non-traditional candidate like the new developer. Well, this, this reporter is a
[02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:21.280]  rocket scientist. Why, where's the American remnant left? And Trump comes out of that.
[02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:28.160]  His father, a John Berger, huge funder, Roy Cohn, the un-American activities architect,
[02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:31.760]  who the left lies about and says, this is a demon all day, like to do me.
[02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:40.560]  And the dragon like, Trump came as a chameleon to Info Wars to like, like, like act like he was,
[02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:47.440]  he was Info Wars before I was born. Planning this the whole time. He's not back down. He's
[02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:51.200]  our champion. That's why all day they tell you, he's failing, he's failing, he's failing. If you
[02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:58.080]  just join us, there'll be no censorship. We'll love you. Just betray Trump. Fat chance. Let's
[02:53:58.080 --> 02:54:03.840]  go back to Trump. Trump, let me say this. My audience, I'd say 90% supports you. Okay.
[02:54:04.480 --> 02:54:12.720]  House Jones, he is this amazing showman. They hate you. They hate prosperity. They hate God.
[02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:18.320]  They hate children and goddamn them to hell. He cries, he yells, he growls.
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:22.880]  Back in, that was totally real when I talked about that. We're talking about stories about
[02:54:22.880 --> 02:54:30.480]  pedophile networks raping and killing kids. Oh, he's a showman. All this other crap. A showman,
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:36.080]  I'm just up here being real. But again, this is, and then they get to the, the piece is called
[02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:41.120]  the case for banning Alex Jones. He's a showman. He's effective. See, it's not that I'm hurting
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:45.440]  Sandy Hook kids or arms. No, no, the being a little honest here. No, he's just too effective.
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:54.560]  Continue. He cries, he yells, he growls. He has this incredible gravelly voice. We're gonna
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:55:01.520]  beat your ass. He's a quite arresting media figure. And he is thumbing his nose at the
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:07.920]  mainstream media, which he considers to be pawns of a global elite that he's very suspicious of
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:13.600]  and that he suspects. I'm very suspicious of the global elite that thought of the Arab Spring
[02:55:13.600 --> 02:55:19.040]  to overthrow four different moderate governments that have women going to college at no burkas
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:24.320]  and then blows their heads off and puts them in sex slavery. And there's like five Netflix shows
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:29.520]  about how great pedophilia is. I mean, you people are suspicious. I'm not suspicious.
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:37.760]  You're the freaking plague. And Jeff Bezos is such a nerd in these text messages that, you know,
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:41.360]  Trump did a tweet and said, I'm so sorry, your company's gonna get broken up now that your
[02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:47.280]  wife knows you're cheating. Wonder who was involved. Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure the inquire just
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:54.640]  got the text messages without anybody else's help. And the whole point is, is that Bezos is in there
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:56:00.320]  fawning over Bono, who steals 99% of the money he raises for Africans on record and is proud of it.
[02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:05.920]  And these old, weird, crazy nerds, they're super old, cool people too. But like, nothing about
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:12.640]  a leftist old person. He like brags to his girlfriend how he knows Bono. Bono hasn't been
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:20.720]  cool in 30 years. Bono is a horrible pink sunglass wearing turd basket. But that just shows how
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:32.400]  this guy's worth $140 billion. And he thinks Bono is cool. A snake like jerk, a pro abortion piece
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:39.280]  of filth. Go back to it. World domination. I'll give Obama this, he's bold. I could never have
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:44.480]  imagined the Islamic radical sleeper cell becoming president. I mean, I can't believe the CIA did
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:52.640]  this. In the process of making these allegations, he has thrown out some pretty remarkable claims.
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:56.160]  We have footage of the police saying get back, they're gonna blow up seven.
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:01.440]  It was all over the news that day. I heard it on CBS radio. We know they staged stuff,
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:07.280]  they've staged it before. And we know they were set and ready with that tragedy, the Boston bombing
[02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:14.320]  that was a total drill on record with the older brother, Tammerland being a CIA asset on record.
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:19.280]  And again, you look at the Aurora shooting, that was totally staged. We're gonna come back with
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:22.960]  more of this. And again, I stand by all this, the Aurora was totally staged. That came out in the
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:28.960]  local news. The Zarnab brothers were CIA cutouts. Doesn't mean Islamic terror isn't real. The point
[02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:33.680]  is they said there was a drill that day. I've got the clips of the news saying they blew up seven.
[02:57:33.680 --> 02:57:38.960]  Everybody say them? How the hell am I a liar? Four hours straight ahead, Roderstone and more,
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:43.200]  and my big statement on Roku that I take this morning, it's about the premiere straight ahead.

[02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:42.560]  you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at info wars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:45.440]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:58.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:58.480 --> 03:00:14.400]  So here's a
[03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:20.160]  good point that we should make. Remember how the Seattle TV station got caught
[03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:25.600]  warping the president, turning him into a goblin like creature. He was even described as goblin
[03:00:25.600 --> 03:00:32.560]  like and slurring his words and then licking his lips in slow motion in a very discombobulating
[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:37.040]  way. The fact that they would even try this shows how crazy they are. But this is what Vic
[03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:41.200]  Berger and others do to me in the videos that they're using in the New York Times piece.
[03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:48.560]  They make me read, they slow down my voice, they speed it up. They do it all to make me look insane.
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:55.200]  And oh, but when the New York Times does it, it's okay. So that's how these guys operate.
[03:00:55.200 --> 03:01:01.360]  Now imagine if I did that, all we did was blow up the video of Ninja Master Jim Acosta grabbing
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:04.400]  the mic and karate chopping her arm. You know, he grabs away and pushes her down. She's shocked,
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:08.080]  it's forceful. I mean, according to feminist, it was a rape. He murdered her according to
[03:01:08.080 --> 03:01:14.240]  feminist, looking at a woman's murder, touching them is damning their soul to hell. But according
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:19.760]  to them, he cut her head off. But as soon as he touches her, it's no big deal. As soon as he touches
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:25.040]  her, it's no problem. And it didn't happen in his edit video, but they're the ones actually editing
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:28.480]  the video and doctoring the video. Blowing it up, it's not editing. And here it is.
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:38.320]  He cries, he yells, he growls. He has this incredible gravelly voice. We're gonna beat your
[03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:46.000]  ass. He's a quite arresting media figure. And he is thumbing his nose at the mainstream media,
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:52.400]  which he considers to be pawns of a global elite that he's very suspicious of, and that he suspects
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:58.800]  is bent on world domination. I'll give Obama this, he's bold. I could never have imagined the
[03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:03.680]  Islamic radical sleeper cell becoming president. I mean, I can't believe the CIA did this.
[03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:11.440]  In the process of making these allegations, he has thrown out some pretty remarkable claims.
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.960]  We have footage of the police saying, get back, they're gonna blow up seven.
[03:02:15.840 --> 03:02:20.240]  It was all over the news that day. I heard it on CBS radio. We know they staged stuff,
[03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:26.080]  they've staged it before. And we know they were set and ready with that tragedy, the Boston bombing,
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:33.120]  that was a total drill on record with the older brother, Tamerlan being a CIA asset on record.
[03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:36.480]  And again, you look at the Aurora shooting, that was totally staged.
[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:43.040]  Roger Stone, who is famous for working with Richard Nixon, persuades Donald Trump to go
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:47.760]  on the Alex Jones show. And he doesn't just go on for a couple of minutes,
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:51.840]  he's on for a half an hour. And it's this rambling conversation.
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:56.240]  We need surveillance, we need proper surveillance. For three years, I've been saying hit the oil
[03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:00.320]  because ISIS is getting strong. We lose with every country and yet we don't get along with any
[03:03:00.320 --> 03:03:08.240]  countries. China is killing us. There's no doubt that Donald Trump and Alex Jones were mutually
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:14.560]  beneficial to each other because his audience is specifically the kind of voters that Donald
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:21.680]  Trump needed and wanted to be talking to. On the other hand, Alex Jones was able to
[03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:30.960]  have a larger platform because of his access to Donald Trump. Roger Stone thinks that Alex Jones
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:38.320]  will be very useful in selling the Donald Trump legislative agenda, whatever that ends up being,
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:47.680]  to a public that is hardwired to be skeptical and disapproving of what happens in Washington, DC.
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:51.440]  And that's somebody telling you the sky's blue.
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:58.880]  And it's all from their perspective, like we sociopathically went, oh,
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:03.600]  you'll be good for me. I'll be good for you. No. I told Roger months before Trump won,
[03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:08.720]  I said he's going to win. And then I said, all hell's going to break loose because I had personal
[03:04:09.600 --> 03:04:15.120]  experiences when I was a kid watching what happened when Reagan left office and George
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:23.920]  Herbert Walker Bush came into office and watching just from some family. I knew what happened with
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:28.720]  with because let me tell you, Bush was a Democrat and he was trying to get rid of all the Reagan
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:34.480]  people that were out there. I'm going to sleep at that. And I learned real early who the bad guys
[03:04:34.480 --> 03:04:43.360]  were real early. And I knew that if we took them out, they were going to come in like hell against
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:48.800]  us. And they did it. And Roger is a smart guy. Roger kept saying, Oh, no, we'll stop them. It'll
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:52.960]  be great. I said, brother, the war just started. We'll talk to Roger in 60 seconds.
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:05:01.680]  That's why we've introduced the info wars life daily digestive pack to help you fuel it right.

[03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:36.480]  All right. Roger stones about to take over but in this segment part of the next I want to air
[03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:43.200]  a really heartfelt I want to say off the cuff because I thought about it a lot but teleprompter
[03:06:43.200 --> 03:06:53.280]  free obviously report that I put out this morning on Roku banning and you know I'm not really
[03:06:53.280 --> 03:07:00.080]  strategic but we created a really primitive app that was halfway broken or page for Roku
[03:07:00.080 --> 03:07:04.720]  seven years ago when it first came out and we had over a million viewers a week on average to it
[03:07:05.280 --> 03:07:09.840]  but during the ban I just forgot to mention it or they would have banned it already
[03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:13.760]  they would have got the brigades but then when somebody made a fan app that shot up the front
[03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:19.120]  page it was so popular within 24 hours it was banned and the hyperventilating about banning us
[03:07:19.120 --> 03:07:25.280]  and all of it was just next level and and really those sandy hook lawyers have gone too far because
[03:07:26.080 --> 03:07:30.400]  they just keep saying I'm sending people to their houses and they're saying he's currently doing it
[03:07:30.400 --> 03:07:35.120]  to Roku you've got to take them off he's on your platforming sending people to our houses that's
[03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:40.320]  totally untrue I've never said go to their houses I'm not saying it now I think sandy hook happened
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:45.440]  and I just I already knew it but it hit me this morning and last night my identity has been stolen
[03:07:47.600 --> 03:07:52.400]  and for years I've said stop saying that I don't say that people died and they won't shut up
[03:07:52.400 --> 03:08:00.800]  they won't stop doing it in my name so I'm gonna get let me tell you I've not been to new town
[03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:08.320]  I'm coming and I'm not I've not I mean it's it's on now so uh I've been so busy and stuff
[03:08:08.320 --> 03:08:11.920]  that I with other issues but I realized they are literally trying to make me the sandy hook man
[03:08:11.920 --> 03:08:15.760]  when it wasn't one tenth of one percent of what I covered but hey don't worry you're gonna get what
[03:08:15.760 --> 03:08:22.480]  you want now with the whole nine yards baby and don't worry everything accredited everything
[03:08:22.480 --> 03:08:30.800]  licensed everything licensed not to be harassing anybody but you want to stick a magnifying glass
[03:08:30.960 --> 03:08:40.000]  down my throat or up my ass okay two way streets two way streets show and everybody knows I'm a
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:48.320]  loving sweet person and uh all I know is that I am not gonna in my life have all the work we've done
[03:08:48.320 --> 03:08:54.560]  for America and freedom be turned into something about sandy hook when it's not my identity I realize
[03:08:54.560 --> 03:09:01.280]  now this is my identity being stolen I don't know how I've been so dumb to understand it but it's
[03:09:01.280 --> 03:09:06.160]  like just reading this and watching this Roger Stone so much is going on so much is happening but
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:11.040]  Trump and the censorship thing as you've said this is the hill he lives or dies on
[03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:17.760]  and now they are going after everybody in high gear and he's put in will William Barr who you
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:24.000]  know best friends with uh with uh Mueller and they're in the same damn church together and
[03:09:24.800 --> 03:09:30.560]  their wives are in the same bible study with bathomat you know I love Trump and I know he's
[03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:36.080]  a good guy he does a lot of good things but when it comes to personnel I mean he might as well
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:42.400]  just hire satan or or maybe I mean I know these guys lie to him and say we're gonna be good uh and
[03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:48.160]  you know I know Barr wrote some stuff about the unitary executive but what the hell is going on here
[03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:55.280]  it's very very hard to know Alex I mean I think I think first of all you're absolutely right I want
[03:09:55.280 --> 03:10:01.680]  to vouch for your version of events here I can't forget election night because of course I was
[03:10:01.680 --> 03:10:08.720]  exhausted but you for it and so was everybody on the Info Wars crew we had worked very hard on
[03:10:08.720 --> 03:10:14.160]  on providing excellent coverage on election night and you seem kind of dejected and down
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:18.880]  and I said to you what's the matter why are you savoring this moment and you said you don't
[03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:26.800]  understand this is not the end this is just the beginning they're never gonna let us have it
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:31.520]  without a fight they're never gonna let as much as you love Trump they're never gonna let him
[03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:36.800]  enact his agenda we're in for the fight of our lives and of course I thought you were wrong
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:44.240]  and you turned out to be absolutely right uh the video you showed from the Washington Post with
[03:10:44.240 --> 03:10:52.480]  that guy manual Roy Franz who I know very well he's a great guy to have a beer with he doesn't
[03:10:52.480 --> 03:10:57.840]  burp without checking with Langley I mean recognize the Washington Post has been a wholly owned
[03:10:57.840 --> 03:11:02.880]  subsidiary indeed the mouthpiece the official organ of the central intelligence agency
[03:11:02.880 --> 03:11:10.720]  since the late 50s after John F Kennedy was murdered former president Harry Truman the last
[03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:18.640]  after Jack Kennedy the previous American president Democrat staunch anti-communist
[03:11:18.640 --> 03:11:24.800]  a believer in America wrote an op-ed piece saying that signing the CIA into the law was the greatest
[03:11:24.800 --> 03:11:32.160]  single mistake that he made president Truman's op-ed ran for one edition before they spiked it
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:37.680]  at the orders of the central intelligence agency and let's be clear he said it's a legacy of ashes
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:42.480]  he should be torn into a thousand pieces and and and let's expand on it create a rogue group similar
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:48.000]  to the FBI leadership not the whole FBI the FBI leadership uh and again we don't say the FBI has
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:51.760]  good people in it to kiss their butt we we there are a lot of good people in there but the top are
[03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:57.360]  bad folks just like the CIA's a bunch of different groups and they're completely out of control and
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:03.840]  and what you just said is true Bezos got $600 million when he bought it from the CIA to co-locate
[03:12:03.840 --> 03:12:08.000]  most of the people there are actual operatives and spies the New York Times is a bunch of
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:12.400]  leftist foundations that even sit above that for policy that's why they're the policemen of the
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:18.160]  internet now it's come out in Project Veritas so when you say they're the CIA they are the CIA on
[03:12:18.160 --> 03:12:24.000]  congressional record and they've been paid Bezos was given money back in a government contract
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:31.680]  just to be the front man to own it for the CIA yeah so the notion that these are free media
[03:12:31.680 --> 03:12:37.040]  outlets exercising the First Amendment and that they're free of governmental influence is completely
[03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:43.360]  false they are totally controlled nothing appears in the pages of the Washington Post it hasn't
[03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:49.440]  been pre-approved out at Langley at the CIA headquarters I know people say oh Stone Jones
[03:12:49.440 --> 03:12:54.080]  you're just conspiracy there oh let me go further I mean I had some high-level former and current CIA
[03:12:54.080 --> 03:12:59.120]  people actually three of them total who were saying oh yeah Trump's great yeah great blah blah
[03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:02.880]  this you know there's good people the CIA they like what you're doing but a couple months ago
[03:13:02.880 --> 03:13:05.600]  I started getting threatened and how you better go against Trump but we're not going to talk to you
[03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:10.560]  anymore and so no your wimps is what you are they stick their finger up when the chai comms are
[03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:14.320]  selling the country out and they go if he might go down we better turn against him you're not
[03:13:14.320 --> 03:13:19.680]  Americans you're cowards you're not even thugs you're not even gangsters you're punk little boys
[03:13:20.640 --> 03:13:26.480]  make me sick on American trash so in the whole coup even Sean Hannity gets it now there's an
[03:13:26.480 --> 03:13:31.760]  ongoing coup against the president going on by the FBI all of its come out the bombshells against
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:36.240]  Trump or bombshells against them as you know that they worry legally spying they lied to congress
[03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:42.320]  they found nothing and they're still ongoing my god this is insane you know Alex I've got to tell
[03:13:42.320 --> 03:13:47.920]  you in the 50 plus years I've been in American politics I've really never seen anything like
[03:13:47.920 --> 03:13:54.320]  this moment it's almost like the New York Times story which revealed it with some excellent reporting
[03:13:54.880 --> 03:14:00.960]  that in the wake of Donald Trump's firing of James Comey who had willfully covered up the
[03:14:00.960 --> 03:14:07.040]  criminality of Hillary Clinton and the breaches of national security involved in her use of a secret
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:15.600]  secret illegal email server they have fomented a greater torrent a greater tsunami of fake news
[03:14:15.600 --> 03:14:20.960]  in the last 72 hours than anything I have seen in the 50 plus years I've been in America and that
[03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:25.360]  means they're one of two things but I think it's both co-equal they're going in a major offensive
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:31.520]  out of desperation that Trump is moving with the grand juries which Q and I didn't craft that
[03:14:31.520 --> 03:14:37.280]  of its rear end which are confirmed now against McCabe and others I think that's what this is
[03:14:37.280 --> 03:14:44.560]  total desperation last moves well the whole new narrative is beyond belief Trump is a Russian
[03:14:44.560 --> 03:14:52.640]  agent Trump works for Putin Trump is trump it is Putin's puppet with no proof oh look he's on the
[03:14:52.640 --> 03:14:59.360]  news he was at a press conference with Putin my god he's standing next to him my wife this morning

[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:09.920]  the Russians I said honey let me look who's saying that let me look at that it's some left wing

[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:34.800]  i swear that i listen to him a lot when i was in high school and later and i forgot about it
[03:21:34.800 --> 03:21:39.760]  and i started listening to him again it's the only music you get stuck in my head let's listen to this
[03:21:39.760 --> 03:21:58.800]  part right here maybe i better fool holding on all this time i look at roger being all serious
[03:21:58.800 --> 03:22:04.160]  he's got such big stuff to talk about he's trying to put him in prison total battle for america
[03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:10.800]  and i'm playing keith whitley songs knowing he's in your life listen to this quote
[03:22:12.320 --> 03:22:17.680]  but i keep hoping someday but you know like keith whitley and george straighter the alex jones
[03:22:17.680 --> 03:22:24.640]  secret weapon that's what i listen to when i'm down today the tyrant rules not by club or fist
[03:22:24.640 --> 03:22:34.080]  but the skies is market research he shepherds his flocks and the ways of utility and comfort
[03:22:34.640 --> 03:22:35.440]  marshal mcluen
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:43.680]  marshal mcluen and make art is how you counter the system hey roger you know i probably won't
[03:22:43.680 --> 03:22:47.280]  even get to this whole thing next time because i'm your host on the show i appreciate that you
[03:22:47.280 --> 03:22:52.400]  did a great job warren's come up with oh and schroyer later but let's get right down to brass
[03:22:52.400 --> 03:22:57.680]  tax as keith whitley introduced us here don't close your eyes we need to face what we're dealing with
[03:22:57.680 --> 03:23:03.360]  here clearly we're not waiting for an offensive the left has launched their final offensive
[03:23:03.360 --> 03:23:08.880]  they found nothing in russia gate and when i say this this isn't hype i say what's true there was
[03:23:08.880 --> 03:23:14.960]  nothing they admit that and so it's total russian proof oh my god robin ailes good lord with nothing
[03:23:14.960 --> 03:23:20.240]  in the articles just the headlines and so what do they think this total fake push does
[03:23:20.240 --> 03:23:29.680]  is trying to intimidate uh his uh his cabinet to go for the uh removal via the amendment
[03:23:29.680 --> 03:23:34.560]  which you said they do two years ago i think we're here because behind the scenes the harassment
[03:23:34.560 --> 03:23:39.520]  of his supporters and his base and and and his stalwarts and his night so the round table
[03:23:39.520 --> 03:23:42.800]  has gone into high gear so i think we i just asked the question i think you're gonna agree
[03:23:42.800 --> 03:23:48.000]  we're in the middle of an act of coup against the president a is that true b is that wrong
[03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:54.240]  and see what do we do about it well at first of all alex let me say that i think it's
[03:23:54.240 --> 03:24:01.200]  absolutely correct we are entering the end game now this is it that they've clearly made their
[03:24:01.200 --> 03:24:07.600]  move winning the house of representatives in a fraudulent election for the democrats was the
[03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:13.520]  final piece of the puzzle that they needed in their effort to remove the duly elected president
[03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:21.440]  here's where they make their strategic mistake alex they believe that we are like them in other
[03:24:21.440 --> 03:24:28.720]  words they think we're in this for money and power they think that that that we are soulless
[03:24:28.720 --> 03:24:38.160]  like them for me this is about my children my grandchildren my godson carter stone davis i
[03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:44.720]  want them to have the same level of freedom and opportunity the same ability to worship the god
[03:24:44.720 --> 03:24:52.240]  they choose that i had uh and that's why this is a fight to the death you can offer us millions of
[03:24:52.240 --> 03:24:58.880]  dollars we won't take it you can squeeze me as they have i've lost my health insurance my life
[03:24:58.880 --> 03:25:06.160]  insurance i've got a scramble to pay rent no i'm not wealthy because they want to squeeze me financially
[03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:12.160]  to see if they can make me make up stories michael cone style against donald trump or maybe give them
[03:25:12.160 --> 03:25:18.080]  something on alex jones it's not true since it's a well known that you're a russian spy and what
[03:25:18.080 --> 03:25:23.760]  they don't understand is we're never going to do it that the harder you kick us the more you try to
[03:25:23.760 --> 03:25:30.160]  censor us the more you try to defame us the harder we're going to fight because we're not in it for
[03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:34.480]  the money and by the way wasn't that what america and the other great nation was built on i mean i
[03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:38.560]  remember my grandfather's and i don't lie and i was in fact the time i didn't get out cool and funny
[03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:44.560]  and manly they were compared to men today i mean you know i'm pretty manly i think especially my
[03:25:44.560 --> 03:25:49.600]  dad's dad was like even way more manly than i am uh like i don't really see people out there as manly
[03:25:49.600 --> 03:25:54.480]  like that he wasn't trying to be manly he was he was a man he would not put up with any of this crap
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:58.640]  and i don't get like you would try to intimidate somebody like that they kill you and i just don't
[03:25:58.640 --> 03:26:08.000]  get where we lost that instinct to not be run over the single most important thing involved here
[03:26:08.800 --> 03:26:15.680]  is their ability to silence us you see they cannot pull off the silent coup without this insidious
[03:26:15.680 --> 03:26:22.800]  and ruthless and relentless campaign of in of internet censorship they've got to close info
[03:26:22.800 --> 03:26:29.200]  wars down because we play the same role that paul revere played in the american revolution
[03:26:29.200 --> 03:26:34.880]  we're getting to the people first with the truth and the truth is like the light that makes these

[03:34:24.720 --> 03:34:30.960]  you know roger i don't want to be uh true dramatic here but let's get down to brass
[03:34:30.960 --> 03:34:35.360]  tacks there's an ongoing coup live against the president right now they're attacking every
[03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:42.080]  associate that is willing to stand up for the country and americans tire of things and a lot
[03:34:42.080 --> 03:34:46.320]  of people are awake a lot are engaged but others don't get the main battles now it's supposed to
[03:34:46.320 --> 03:34:49.920]  happen during elections they don't get this is not an election the country's in a fight for
[03:34:49.920 --> 03:34:54.320]  its very survival right now so i kind of took the show over today this hour you were going to be
[03:34:54.320 --> 03:34:58.800]  hosting you'll be on the war i'm coming up uh in the next three hours with old shroyer and yourself
[03:34:58.800 --> 03:35:04.240]  but what else is going on what else is on the radar screen and what do the listeners need to do
[03:35:04.240 --> 03:35:08.800]  not like we're bitching at them but they want to be in the fight uh there's so much they should
[03:35:08.800 --> 03:35:12.960]  be doing right now uh and so i'll get your perspective of what i should do what you should
[03:35:12.960 --> 03:35:18.480]  do i mean what is what is your gut level on that well in all honesty alex we began an initiative
[03:35:18.480 --> 03:35:24.080]  before christmas that is still i think the component that's key to all of this and that
[03:35:24.080 --> 03:35:30.080]  is to persuade president trump to right now direct his justice department to initiate
[03:35:30.080 --> 03:35:35.760]  antitrust action to stop the racketeering by the internet tech giants who are trying to
[03:35:35.760 --> 03:35:43.040]  strangle not just info wars but every single conservative republican pro trump voice on
[03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:49.600]  the internet this is the key to victory if we lose this fight there is no winning and therefore
[03:35:49.600 --> 03:35:58.240]  folks who want to help you can still go to right trump dot com right trump w r i t e trump dot com
[03:35:58.240 --> 03:36:04.560]  sitting in my garage i have 50 000 letters for the president donald trump i'm waiting until
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:10.720]  he comes to palm beach he's been working so hard to break the back of the democrats on the stand
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:16.320]  down over the wall he has not come to florida but i can tell you i'm going to personally deliver
[03:36:16.320 --> 03:36:22.880]  your letters to marlago so he can see that the american people support his tweets on the subject
[03:36:22.880 --> 03:36:29.040]  but they want him to take action this is not a program we've abandoned folks it's just a program
[03:36:29.040 --> 03:36:35.520]  we were forced to put aside but right now there is nothing more important because if they shut
[03:36:35.520 --> 03:36:41.840]  info wars down america's early warning system is out of commission you're not going to be able to
[03:36:41.840 --> 03:36:46.640]  find out what's going on you're going to hear about the coup as they're leading donald trump to
[03:36:46.640 --> 03:36:53.440]  the gallows and that will be too late there is no more important fight now the other thing and you
[03:36:53.440 --> 03:36:58.560]  say this every day alex and i repeated on the war room if you see a link of something we do

[03:38:01.680 --> 03:38:08.960]  people know oh i put out alex jones i'm gonna get seven days out of my facebook where i talk to my
[03:38:08.960 --> 03:38:14.640]  grandbabies i don't want to do that that's fine it'll take them a while to demonize news wars and
[03:38:14.640 --> 03:38:19.440]  brand it for banning we found people don't get banned they don't get blocked for news wars and
[03:38:19.440 --> 03:38:24.800]  we're going to start launching new websites every month that'll be the new website you can promote
[03:38:24.800 --> 03:38:28.720]  our syndicated information and not get banned on twitter or facebook because they've just got you
[03:38:28.720 --> 03:38:35.040]  know people that barely speaking english and india great folks but over there you know censoring
[03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:39.360]  and kind of brigading leftist but they're always busy using drugs they're not working
[03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:48.160]  here in america so literally they don't know which end is up and so we're launching in the next few
[03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:53.920]  weeks there'll be new websites every month and we'll keep the sites going forever too we're gonna
[03:38:53.920 --> 03:39:01.280]  launch i plan to launch this year 20 websites 30 websites we're gonna launch a uh what we're working
[03:39:01.280 --> 03:39:07.920]  with folks that are launching a real social network that'll be free and open wait till you see that
[03:39:07.920 --> 03:39:12.320]  that's gonna happen the next few months and you know they got me behind last year with the demonization
[03:39:12.320 --> 03:39:19.360]  lawsuits the lies i wanted to hire more people i wanted to do more shows but a lot of it is you
[03:39:19.360 --> 03:39:23.360]  think these personalities i'm not being mean about it actually scares the hell out of me you think a
[03:39:23.360 --> 03:39:27.040]  lot of these personalities you see on the internet that seem together and ready and doing it
[03:39:30.400 --> 03:39:35.600]  day on average there's there's not a work ethic out there like the conservative or
[03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:40.480]  libertarian internationalist work ethic is very high compared to leftist but it's still not an
[03:39:40.480 --> 03:39:49.360]  impoverished work ethic and so i'm trying to build an army and i'm trying to find the people to get
[03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:55.840]  on air and it's and it's just it's done an easy situation but uh here's the thing i don't know
[03:39:55.840 --> 03:40:02.560]  how metaphysics work i don't know how the universe works i know how the cow ate the cabbage if you're
[03:40:02.560 --> 03:40:13.520]  not expanding you're imploding there is no set stasis there is no managed system there is no
[03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:23.200]  uncontinuum the continuum is always launching forward into the future so
[03:40:28.240 --> 03:40:33.920]  i can go on air and tell people that info wars could shut down and that would be a very true
[03:40:33.920 --> 03:40:36.000]  statement if i don't have the will
[03:40:36.000 --> 03:40:43.920]  know info wars could shut down tomorrow if i fight as hard as i can
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:51.040]  and people don't support us we shut down in a year you support us and get creative and get
[03:40:51.040 --> 03:40:55.200]  fired up we won't just be here a hundred years we'll be here forever we'll turn the whole thing
[03:40:55.200 --> 03:41:02.560]  around our grandchildren on mars bases and jump bases and god knows what are gonna look back and
[03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:08.000]  say you know that we we struggled here we made it unlike all these other test cases that god
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:13.760]  put in place you know there's a lot of eggs a lot of like christ said i have other flocks it's a lot of
[03:41:14.880 --> 03:41:19.600]  god's big god makes a lot of stuff you know and you know i want to be on the winning team i want
[03:41:19.600 --> 03:41:26.400]  to like hey go hey come on in you made it good to have you here yeah you you were infested by
[03:41:26.400 --> 03:41:30.400]  the child raping demons you ought to see we had to go through but thank god we're moving forward
[03:41:30.400 --> 03:41:35.760]  now we got some big challenges though because we got these guys to deal with and that's really
[03:41:35.760 --> 03:41:41.120]  where this goes is you want to play video games all day but yeah god's got a big war for you ready
[03:41:42.080 --> 03:41:47.680]  i've actually let's just say i've seen a few things let's just say i've seen some of the
[03:41:47.680 --> 03:41:54.400]  levels above this one and it's unbelievably amazing it's also scary and so people have
[03:41:54.400 --> 03:41:59.600]  been willing to face fear if you can't face george soros and hillary clinton and adolf hitler and
[03:41:59.600 --> 03:42:08.720]  malice tongue are you gonna really be able to face the other stuff because god wants warriors
[03:42:08.720 --> 03:42:16.000]  that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight and so this is playland
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:22.080]  this is baby town this is dress up this is like little boys playing soldier in the woods and you're
[03:42:22.080 --> 03:42:26.960]  like well this is pretty damn real i'm pretty i understand let's understand you don't go to
[03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:30.960]  the next level without getting a big weight put on your back and i mean i don't know what's going
[03:42:30.960 --> 03:42:37.760]  to happen to me in the future i mean all i know is i want to go with the master built i want to go
[03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:44.480]  to the next level i want to be with the spirit that i've experienced not these devil worshipers

[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:38.080]  this is really life and death and i don't want to be overconfident in this whole thing they are branding

[03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:25.120]  missing their basic humanity and that's what they're so scared of and thank god trump's pulling
[03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:29.600]  people out of all these countries thank god he's trying to fix juvenile justice and justice reform

[03:51:43.120 --> 03:51:50.640]  i'm sure it's coming up and i'll get him to air this full video there too
[03:51:51.520 --> 03:51:54.080]  please ask someone as soon as you can the first hour to air my whole statement
[03:51:54.080 --> 03:51:57.840]  it takes two segments and it needs to get out it's very important but the whole thing will be
[03:51:57.840 --> 03:52:02.080]  posted here's the first few minutes of it will end this transmission here it is last night
[03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:09.360]  hundreds of newspapers tv stations and television networks all unanimously ran
[03:52:09.360 --> 03:52:17.120]  the same headlines that alex jones because he's dangerous has been taken off of the popular
[03:52:17.120 --> 03:52:26.000]  streaming service rocu less than one day after his new channel went up i have a statement about
[03:52:26.000 --> 03:52:32.320]  what really happened with rocu and what this signifies for free speech in this country in a moment
[03:52:32.320 --> 03:52:38.320]  but first i want to look at the heart of why we've been removed off of rocu
[03:52:38.880 --> 03:52:46.960]  and hundreds of other platforms in a systematic coordinated campaign the democratic party led
[03:52:46.960 --> 03:52:52.560]  by hillary clinton and john pedesta chose to make sandy hook and my statements about it
[03:52:53.760 --> 03:53:01.040]  the centerpiece of their campaign against donald trump in the final months of the 2016
[03:53:01.040 --> 03:53:07.760]  presidential campaign hillary clinton and the willing accomplice corporate media
[03:53:08.560 --> 03:53:15.840]  then twisted and exaggerated what i had said about sandy hook when hillary subsequently
[03:53:15.840 --> 03:53:23.280]  then lost the election that continued to be one of the main narratives the democrats were putting
[03:53:23.280 --> 03:53:29.440]  out and it became mythological what i had supposedly done at sandy hook and who i had sent
[03:53:29.440 --> 03:53:36.640]  to go out for the families none of it was true but i had been typecast i had been labeled
[03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:45.280]  the sandy hook denier man when in the full spectrum of what i've covered and what we've
[03:53:45.280 --> 03:53:53.040]  done here at info wars sandy hook has been less than one tenth of one percent of what we've covered
[03:53:53.040 --> 03:54:00.720]  but that was in the first four or five years after the tragic events in the following three years
[03:54:00.720 --> 03:54:10.000]  yes it's hard to believe it's been almost eight years the media began to hype what i had supposedly
[03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:15.680]  said and done as a way to again get people to dislike me and to not listen what i had to say
[03:54:15.680 --> 03:54:28.160]  on a host of issues now fast forward to 2018 members of the sandy hook families through
[03:54:28.160 --> 03:54:34.800]  prominent democrat lawyers filed lawsuits on me now years before i had said that i thought sandy
[03:54:34.800 --> 03:54:41.040]  hook happened years before i had said don't go to the sandy hook folks houses because i'd already
[03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:45.920]  been falsely blamed over and over again for doing that in the beginning when i never did
[03:54:47.680 --> 03:54:57.040]  and steadfastly the lawyers and the families and all the pr people will never quote me
[03:54:57.040 --> 03:55:02.800]  they'll never call me for a comment and they go the lawyers the families all these people
[03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:09.200]  on television and on new york times podcast just last week and say if he'll just stop saying our
[03:55:09.200 --> 03:55:15.120]  children died we wouldn't assume if he'll just stop harassing us we'll stop and and when i first
[03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:19.120]  heard this a few years ago i was like i did say i thought it happened here's a tape from three years
[03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:23.760]  ago and that was two years ago so that was five years ago and there would never be any response
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:31.360]  so then i started reaching out to the families long before i was sued saying hey the internet
[03:55:31.360 --> 03:55:36.080]  questioned what happened people saw some anomalies the public questions big events because
[03:55:36.080 --> 03:55:40.800]  the babies and incubators in the iraq war didn't get their brains bashed out that launched a whole
[03:55:40.800 --> 03:55:46.480]  war people know about gulf of tonkin that was based on a lie that killed millions people know about
[03:55:46.480 --> 03:55:51.840]  false flags both in fiction and in nonfiction the whole house of cards tv show had that almost
[03:55:51.840 --> 03:55:58.320]  every episode so the fact that the internet questioned sandy hook and then we looked at
[03:55:58.320 --> 03:56:02.640]  the anomalies and had debates about it can be cherry picked and taken out of context but
[03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:10.640]  but within a few years the sandy hook investigators some of them were so kooky and so aggressive
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:16.480]  that i began to realize that some of what they had found wasn't true so that i couldn't say that
[03:56:17.040 --> 03:56:22.400]  it was totally synthetic and staged but it doesn't matter because it's all taken out of context and
[03:56:22.400 --> 03:56:29.680]  used as a bludgeon to beat the free press and myself and my family and i have children over the
[03:56:29.680 --> 03:56:37.200]  head so it's not fair and it's destructive even if you hate alex jones or the image they've built
[03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:44.240]  in the media to say it's hurtful to say nobody died and to say don't come to people's houses
[03:56:45.440 --> 03:56:52.640]  and then it's the very lawyers and pr firms that are out there saying it over and over and over
[03:56:52.640 --> 03:56:59.920]  and over again in my name in my identity and i have made countless videos we have reached out
[03:56:59.920 --> 03:57:07.200]  i have said please stop saying that i'm currently saying go to people's houses when i never did it
[03:57:07.200 --> 03:57:12.240]  to begin with they're saying there's a clear and present danger they're saying there's a crisis
[03:57:13.120 --> 03:57:18.320]  they're saying that you've got to take him off the air because he's sending people to harass us
[03:57:18.320 --> 03:57:27.280]  that is a false report to the wider world published everywhere there have been over 10
