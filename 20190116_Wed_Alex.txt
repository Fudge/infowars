[00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.786]  We've got it.
[00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:09.090]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.472]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:19.135]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:39.725]  If you want a glimpse into what the left hopes to bring to the United States, look no further than Communist China, where political dissidents are now being arrested and interrogated for what they put on Twitter.
[00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:40.827]  Sounds familiar, right?
[00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:51.698]  Over the past few years, the tolerant left has become increasingly intolerant of speech they disagree with.
[00:00:51.698 --> 00:01:01.646]  Calls to ban what they deem to be hate speech have only been intensified, and social media websites' terms of agreement have become that of a Soviet concentration camp.
[00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:02.727]  Don't believe me?
[00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:12.354]  Just Ask Voices like Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, or Laura Loomer have all been banned from various social media platforms for standing up to the Washington establishment.
[00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:16.636]  To the left, censoring right-wing voices on social media isn't far enough.
[00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:20.157]  They seek the demise and total eradication of the First Amendment.
[00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:26.400]  I think it's, like, super important here to carve out a section for hate speech, which naturally shouldn't be allowed.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.382]  Their end goal is for Twitter's terms of services to become the law here in this country.
[00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:34.424]  In China, this is quite literally the case.
[00:01:34.424 --> 00:01:39.246]  Ironically, using Twitter in China will put your entire life at risk.
[00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:39.826]  There he is!
[00:01:42.808 --> 00:01:54.333]  According to the New York Times, one man spent 15 days in a detention center, the police threatened another's family, and a third was chained to a chair for eight hours of interrogation.
[00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.474]  Their offense?
[00:01:55.474 --> 00:01:56.795]  Posting on Twitter.
[00:01:56.795 --> 00:02:06.119]  The New York Times article goes on to say, the Chinese government has increasingly demanded that both Google and Facebook take down content that officials object to,
[00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.842]  Even though both companies' sites are inaccessible in China.
[00:02:09.842 --> 00:02:21.311]  They then cite one example where a user had his Facebook and Twitter accounts suspended after criticizing the Chinese government, suggesting that the tech giants are complicit in silencing dissent to the communist regime.
[00:02:28.197 --> 00:02:35.181]  Despite the social media platform being banned, there are an estimated 3.2 million Twitter users in China.
[00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.523]  This amounts to 0.4% of internet users in China.
[00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:45.907]  The reason China is so opposed to social media is the same reason why Alex Jones was banned from virtually every platform here in the United States.
[00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:52.671]  Big government socialists want no opposition, no competition to their ideas, and no questions asked.
[00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:59.055]  They want to maintain a narrative that socialism is all butterflies and rainbows, and fear the truth leaking out.
[00:03:02.762 --> 00:03:03.623]  That'll scare you.
[00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:11.714]  In fact, it's been reported that the police in China will print out people's tweets, critical of the government, and demand that they take them down.
[00:03:11.714 --> 00:03:13.096]  It's not 2005!
[00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:15.860]  You can't just go online and say whatever you want!
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.442]  Alright, alright, I'll delete the tweet.
[00:03:18.122 --> 00:03:19.584]  You haven't deleted it yet?
[00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:38.583]  They're taking us one after another.
[00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:40.584]  We have no ability to fight back.
[00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:46.126]  I hope this is a wake-up call to all right-wingers that this is what we're up against in the United States.
[00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:49.707]  There is no doubt that these are the policies the left hopes to implement.
[00:03:49.707 --> 00:03:51.148]  They hate free speech.
[00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.008]  They hate alternative viewpoints.
[00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:57.270]  And they seek punishment for those who won't submit to their left-wing programming.
[00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.270]  Orange man bad.
[00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:08.096]  In fact, in some states like New York, similar legislation is already being explored.
[00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:17.502]  Democrats in the state want you to turn over your social media passwords to the government so they can comb through your profiles before allowing you to purchase a firearm.
[00:04:17.502 --> 00:04:23.986]  Imagine needing to forfeit over your social media accounts to the government to exercise one of your most basic civil rights.
[00:04:23.986 --> 00:04:25.087]  Complete lunacy!
[00:04:25.387 --> 00:04:29.169]  These draconian laws are already bleeding their way into our country.
[00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:36.712]  And if we don't act now, it won't be long until America as we know it is gone and indistinguishable from communist China.
[00:04:36.712 --> 00:04:39.313]  Stand up now or forever be silenced.
[00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:53.502]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:04:53.502 --> 00:05:00.323]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:05:00.323 --> 00:05:03.804]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:07.585]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:05:07.585 --> 00:05:13.846]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:16.627]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:05:17.347 --> 00:05:21.171]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:27.658]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:05:27.658 --> 00:05:32.623]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:05:33.362 --> 00:05:37.284]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:05:37.284 --> 00:05:44.488]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:05:44.488 --> 00:05:49.190]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.394]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:05:55.394 --> 00:05:59.376]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:06:09.722 --> 00:06:30.117]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:30.117 --> 00:06:32.399]  I have had an extreme epiphany this morning.
[00:06:34.887 --> 00:06:38.488]  An extreme epiphany.
[00:06:38.488 --> 00:06:46.329]  In fact, I have the key to defeating the globalists.
[00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:50.070]  The key.
[00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.051]  And I'm going to get into it in the next segment.
[00:06:55.051 --> 00:07:00.112]  But first, an important prelude to that is Sean Hannity.
[00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:36.862]  So that is a prelude with Sean Hannity talking about the fact that this country is under an active coup against the president.
[00:07:36.862 --> 00:07:41.666]  Now you have to understand that Sean Hannity
[00:07:44.122 --> 00:07:45.543]  Is being told he's going to be fired.
[00:07:45.543 --> 00:07:47.363]  And he said, fine, fire me.
[00:07:47.363 --> 00:07:51.265]  I don't have that from Sean Hannity, I have it from people that have been in the room repeatedly.
[00:07:51.265 --> 00:07:53.146]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:57.667]  So that's how close this country is not even having Sean Hannity on air.
[00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:07.671]  For telling the truth, because what you're about to hear him say, his monologues posted at Infowars.com, is the truth.
[00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:09.812]  That's how dire the straits are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:15.298]  Alright, here's the report.
[00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:40.496]  Plotted to destroy your duly elected president, and this goes way beyond what we already knew up until this point.
[00:08:40.496 --> 00:08:49.899]  Now according to this report, Friday New York Times, as usual, anonymous sources, two days after Comey was unceremoniously terminated, several top FBI officials...
[00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:54.985]  Actually questioned whether or not President Trump was working directly for Russia.
[00:08:54.985 --> 00:08:59.391]  Now, they did this without a single shred of evidence.
[00:08:59.391 --> 00:09:01.854]  Zero probable cause.
[00:09:01.854 --> 00:09:04.758]  Zero proof of any collusion.
[00:09:04.758 --> 00:09:05.619]  It was a witch hunt.
[00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.620]  The President's been right from day one.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:15.504]  They opened an investigation into whether or not Russia directed the President to fire their beloved Trump hater, James Comey.
[00:09:15.504 --> 00:09:20.306]  Now this despite Comey's testimony that there was no evidence of collusion.
[00:09:20.306 --> 00:09:26.569]  For nine months they had been looking into this and that Trump was not the target of his investigation.
[00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:33.072]  Remember, even Comey, the Trump hater that he is, admitted that the President could fire him for any reason.
[00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.933]  Nobody in the media seems to want to tell you that.
[00:09:35.473 --> 00:09:48.443]  Now, Congressman John Ratcliffe told our own Catherine Herridge, quote, in May of 2017, political bias infected senior FBI leadership and emotion, not evidence, drove their decision-making.
[00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:52.866]  Now, his closed-door interview with the former FBI counsel James Baker revealed this.
[00:09:52.866 --> 00:10:03.615]  This is important, quote, FBI senior leadership could not accept that Comey was fired for cause and the president had the constitutional authority to terminate Comey.
[00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:07.237]  So they begin the witch hunt, which had already started nine months earlier.
[00:10:07.237 --> 00:10:16.601]  Now, President Trump's former attorney, John Dowd, has called the FBI's anti-Trump operations a political coup.
[00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:18.602]  Watch this.
[00:10:18.602 --> 00:10:23.665]  Little did I know that it appears that they were all in it together.
[00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:29.348]  I mean, Rosenstein, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, the whole crowd.
[00:10:30.183 --> 00:10:33.425]  And that they were out to get this president, no matter what.
[00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:36.448]  I don't think they sincerely believed anything about Russia.
[00:10:36.448 --> 00:10:38.029]  This is our worst nightmare.
[00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:43.513]  That someone with that kind of power would then decide to go after the president.
[00:10:43.513 --> 00:10:45.114]  I mean, it's a coup.
[00:10:45.114 --> 00:10:49.557]  That's right, it's an attempted coup by Comey and his crowd.
[00:10:49.557 --> 00:10:52.079]  And the evidence is all about there.
[00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:55.221]  I take the New York Times article as an admission.
[00:10:56.212 --> 00:10:56.352]  Okay.
[00:11:11.032 --> 00:11:15.075]  Deep state officials that we have been uncovering now for nearly two years.
[00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:19.139]  Did they do anything other, these top officials, than hate the president?
[00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:20.560]  And are you really surprised?
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:26.765]  Remember, these are the same bureaucrats, they openly rooted for Hillary Clinton to win the election.
[00:11:26.765 --> 00:11:31.029]  Peter Strzok texting that Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero.
[00:11:31.029 --> 00:11:33.311]  And of course said all those horrible things about the president.
[00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:34.872]  The same officials who
[00:11:34.892 --> 00:11:45.217]  Who wrote an exoneration in May of 2016, months before actually interviewing Hillary and 16 other witnesses in July, before they exonerated her.
[00:11:45.217 --> 00:11:48.779]  It was already written, the exoneration, before the investigation.
[00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:50.420]  The same people that yawned.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.501]  We know.
[00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:53.062]  It is incontrovertible.
[00:11:53.062 --> 00:11:53.862]  Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:54.282 --> 00:11:55.823]  Obstructed justice.
[00:11:55.823 --> 00:12:00.126]  She destroyed, subpoenaed emails, 33,000 of them.
[00:12:00.126 --> 00:12:02.948]  Washed her hard drive with bleach bit.
[00:12:02.948 --> 00:12:07.592]  Smashing smartphones and iPhones with a hammer and taking away SIM cards.
[00:12:07.592 --> 00:12:14.757]  The same people who looked the other way when Hillary and the DNC funneled money through Perkins Coie, a law firm.
[00:12:15.217 --> 00:12:24.183]  A campaign finance violation, to hire a research firm, to hire, oh, Christopher Steele, a foreign national, to give us Russian lies.
[00:12:24.183 --> 00:12:31.388]  The same bureaucrats who all but applauded when Clinton's funneled cash used to hire Christopher Steele.
[00:12:31.388 --> 00:12:32.189]  Why?
[00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:42.896]  To produce a dossier that we now know were full of lies, misinformation, propaganda about President Trump, which we now know today are debunked.
[00:12:43.436 --> 00:12:55.584]  The same people who helped disseminate those Russian lies that she paid for to you, the American people, and throughout the highest levels of our government, doing that before an election.
[00:12:55.584 --> 00:13:04.630]  So-called trusted officials who used the dossier to defraud a FISA court multiple times to spy on a Trump campaign associate.
[00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.053]  By the way, fraud before the court.
[00:13:07.053 --> 00:13:11.998]  The same people who used that dossier to open up an investigation into Trump.
[00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:14.140]  This all has happened.
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:21.508]  And yeah, a baseless investigation into a president being controlled by Russia is now just par for the course.
[00:13:21.508 --> 00:13:23.350]  And the hysteria of the media is even worse.
[00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:29.097]  Remember, this was nine months after they had already been investigating so-called collusion.
[00:13:29.097 --> 00:13:37.146]  And by nine months period of time, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, all hate Trump, all said they had nothing.
[00:13:38.848 --> 00:13:43.970]  Mark Penn, who recently wrote an op-ed, he points out the blatant unequal justice under the law.
[00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:57.315]  Quote, somehow every clear security breach in the Clinton camp was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.
[00:13:57.315 --> 00:14:06.098]  Now a former assistant director of intelligence at the FBI is rightly calling out his old colleagues for this massive abuse of power.
[00:14:06.098 --> 00:14:06.438]  Take a look.
[00:14:07.916 --> 00:14:17.869]  Are we criminalizing or are we exercising the legitimate authorities of the FBI to investigate policy differences?
[00:14:17.869 --> 00:14:21.954]  To investigate foreign policy stances by an administration?
[00:14:21.954 --> 00:14:23.455]  That's not the role of the FBI.
[00:14:24.542 --> 00:14:25.282]  No, it's not.
[00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:29.364]  And despite everything we just showed you, the special counsel investigation rolls on.
[00:14:29.364 --> 00:14:33.967]  They're not looking into Hillary Clinton, her phony Russian dossier that she paid for.
[00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:38.609]  Their focus is singularly on President Trump and everyone around him.
[00:14:38.609 --> 00:14:45.792]  However, tonight at least one so-called journalist from the hate Trump media is trying to play down expectations.
[00:14:45.792 --> 00:14:53.176]  Well, people are hyping up every second, every minute, every hour of every day about Trump and Russia and about the Mueller report.
[00:14:53.176 --> 00:14:53.576]  Take a look.
[00:14:54.912 --> 00:15:02.476]  What I am getting is that this is all building up to the Mueller report and raising expectations of a bombshell report.
[00:15:02.476 --> 00:15:06.298]  And there have been expectations that have been building, of course, for over a year on this.
[00:15:06.298 --> 00:15:15.443]  But people who are closest to what Mueller has been doing, who have interacted with the special counsel, caution me that this report is almost certain to be anti-climatic.
[00:15:16.364 --> 00:15:17.505]  Anti-climatic.
[00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:19.847]  Honestly, I don't trust what you just heard.
[00:15:19.847 --> 00:15:34.640]  Given the overwhelming partisan makeup of Mueller's team and their behavior throughout this process, consisting of high-powered Democratic donors and attorneys, mark my words, they have and will continue to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.881]  They've been doing it now for two years.
[00:15:36.505 --> 00:15:39.027]  He goes on to say he believes they're going to have a fake bombshell.
[00:15:39.027 --> 00:15:43.009]  This is a criminal coup of rogue government.
[00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.969]  This is really happening.
[00:15:43.969 --> 00:15:47.371]  This is a rogue power unto itself.
[00:15:47.371 --> 00:15:50.753]  Criminals that covered up for the Clintons and are on the Russian payroll.
[00:15:50.753 --> 00:15:52.254]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:15:52.254 --> 00:15:54.855]  Mueller, all of them, are literal Russian agents.
[00:15:59.232 --> 00:16:05.596]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:16:05.596 --> 00:16:08.618]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:08.618 --> 00:16:14.561]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:18.344]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.

[00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:03.880]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.642]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.642 --> 00:18:16.913]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.694 --> 00:18:26.859]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.859 --> 00:18:32.663]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.663 --> 00:18:37.926]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.926 --> 00:18:40.187]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.547 --> 00:18:42.249]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.249 --> 00:18:52.262]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.262 --> 00:18:54.925]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:59.631]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:20:03.257 --> 00:20:21.984]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:21.984 --> 00:20:28.146]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[00:21:00.189 --> 00:21:02.590]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:15.100]  And we are here on the verge of really trying to choose what our future destiny is going to be.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.801]  That's obviously an understatement.
[00:21:16.801 --> 00:21:20.224]  So earlier I said that I've had an epiphany.
[00:21:20.224 --> 00:21:26.350]  Now you can take all that knowledge in that epiphany and realize that an epiphany
[00:21:27.364 --> 00:21:47.140]  Is a lot of things you already knew, but when all the different pieces come together, and you know you're right from past experience with previous epiphanies you've had, you know you have lightning in a bottle, you know you have Promethean fire, you know you have the way to defeat the enemy.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:54.446]  I have been so focused on trying to defeat the globalists that I even dream at night now, basically every night,
[00:21:55.356 --> 00:22:04.600]  Where I am working and studying and researching and it's real video clips, real history, real analysis and having the pieces come together.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:14.364]  Now, obviously something like that is hard to articulate because you'll only get pieces of it and not the real nuance.
[00:22:14.364 --> 00:22:19.686]  It's like trying to describe the Grand Canyon to somebody that's never been there in person.
[00:22:19.686 --> 00:22:23.088]  You see photos, it looks big, it looks interesting, but when you stand there,
[00:22:24.298 --> 00:22:36.640]  And you're looking 10 miles across to the other side, and an eagle flies by, and there's crisp wind, cold wind in your face, and snow falling.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.941]  It's totally different.
[00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:44.062]  The real thing versus photos.
[00:22:44.062 --> 00:22:49.403]  Well, it's the same thing here, but let me try to quantify this as best I can.
[00:22:49.403 --> 00:22:50.443]  The epiphany came
[00:22:54.805 --> 00:23:00.806]  And this is a doorway into the crystallization.
[00:23:00.806 --> 00:23:14.909]  When I was up here at about 11 o'clock at night with Rob Dew and Zimmerman and Daria and others, and I was going to shoot a response to Roku banning us.
[00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:16.729]  And I was reading over all the news.
[00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:21.670]  I had about a dozen articles or 15 articles or so.
[00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.590]  And I pulled back.
[00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:36.218]  And I had the epiphany, or the beginning of it, and I said, let's just go home.
[00:23:36.218 --> 00:23:41.720]  Because they're not going to even pick up what I say anyways.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:49.001]  And just be calm about it, and really get the gist of what is the story.
[00:23:49.001 --> 00:23:51.762]  It's not that I got taken off the hundredth and something platform.
[00:23:53.575 --> 00:23:55.857]  It's not that it's a beta test to take everybody else down.
[00:23:55.857 --> 00:23:58.779]  That was important.
[00:23:58.779 --> 00:24:13.630]  But it was reading what the Democrats and what the lawyers said feverishly, breathlessly, in the Washington Post, the New York Times and everywhere, all in lockstep, speaking for the families.
[00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:21.435]  And when the families go on radio and TV, they say it too, the exact same words, exact same order.
[00:24:21.435 --> 00:24:21.976]  It was that
[00:24:26.224 --> 00:24:33.653]  I knew I questioned Sandy Hook from a place of historically understanding things can be staged, and I have a right to do that.
[00:24:33.653 --> 00:24:43.305]  But it was the way that they then built it up into a straw man and built it up into this typecast identity of who I was, it was a very small part of what we ever covered.
[00:24:43.305 --> 00:24:44.146]  I didn't originate it.
[00:24:46.513 --> 00:24:47.913]  Questioning it.
[00:24:47.913 --> 00:24:50.214]  I looked at both sides throughout the years.
[00:24:50.214 --> 00:24:52.875]  Within a few years after it, this is like 8 years ago.
[00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:54.556]  I said, I'm sick of people talking about this.
[00:24:54.556 --> 00:24:56.336]  This is not who I am.
[00:24:56.336 --> 00:24:57.857]  I know mass shootings happen.
[00:24:57.857 --> 00:25:00.257]  Because they were already trying to make it my identity.
[00:25:00.257 --> 00:25:02.978]  And say that I just said it to be mean or to get attention.
[00:25:02.978 --> 00:25:06.720]  You say stuff like that, you get taken off the air.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.160]  You don't get rich from it.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.921]  Saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:12.041]  I lost almost all my radio stations in 2001.
[00:25:12.041 --> 00:25:12.841]  I was exploding then.
[00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:17.008]  Absolutely like wildfire.
[00:25:17.008 --> 00:25:19.929]  Over 120-something stations, 130 stations.
[00:25:19.929 --> 00:25:20.769]  Might even hit like 150.
[00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:26.290]  And I went down to 30-something stations within two months.
[00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.451]  Was I doing that because I was going to get rich off saying it was an inside job?
[00:25:30.451 --> 00:25:33.392]  I saw CBS when they said they blew up Building 7.
[00:25:33.392 --> 00:25:35.592]  I didn't know what happened, but later they said it never happened.
[00:25:35.592 --> 00:25:36.932]  But later, we got the footage.
[00:25:36.932 --> 00:25:38.253]  Years later, the archives were put up.
[00:25:38.253 --> 00:25:40.693]  And CNN!
[00:25:40.693 --> 00:25:44.474]  I was in the car to get a pizza and heard CBS Radio again, back when they had that.
[00:25:45.447 --> 00:25:50.672]  Saying they blew up Building 7 with bombs to protect the other buildings!
[00:25:50.672 --> 00:25:53.936]  Oh, but the lawyers say, you know, I did all this to get rich.
[00:25:53.936 --> 00:26:06.429]  But the epiphany was, I was projecting my humanity onto the lawyers and onto the system and the Democrats, thinking maybe they actually
[00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:09.491]  Believe I'm a mean guy or something.
[00:26:09.491 --> 00:26:11.012]  But then it all clicked.
[00:26:11.012 --> 00:26:15.433]  They all know I've said don't go to people's houses and never did.
[00:26:15.433 --> 00:26:22.254]  They all know that I've reached out and told the truth.
[00:26:22.254 --> 00:26:29.596]  And so they're the ones putting it out and saying nobody died through my mouth, through my voice.
[00:26:29.596 --> 00:26:34.757]  And they're the ones saying go to people's houses and investigate.
[00:26:34.757 --> 00:26:36.057]  They just won't let it go away.
[00:26:38.206 --> 00:26:40.247]  And that's only a window into the epiphany.
[00:26:40.247 --> 00:26:45.290]  It was the realization that I was being a real person.
[00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.293]  And I felt bad.
[00:26:49.293 --> 00:26:57.578]  Not just that they were projecting onto me something I hadn't done and twisting it, but I was still feeling guilt.
[00:26:57.578 --> 00:27:02.641]  And last night and this morning, all the guilt just lifted off of me.
[00:27:04.011 --> 00:27:07.573]  And it's like I've hit this giant second wind now.
[00:27:07.573 --> 00:27:08.573]  And I'm blessed.
[00:27:08.573 --> 00:27:09.553]  I love God.
[00:27:09.553 --> 00:27:10.334]  I want to tell the truth.
[00:27:10.334 --> 00:27:15.056]  And God has put me in this position, and all of us in this position, to go through this persecution.
[00:27:15.056 --> 00:27:20.138]  And out of this, a great truth is going to come forward.
[00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.879]  Because I genuinely question Sandy Hook.
[00:27:24.921 --> 00:27:31.508]  And people come up to me everywhere on the street, black, white, old, young, liberal, and they go, hey man, you shouldn't have gone back on that.
[00:27:31.508 --> 00:27:32.309]  Something's wrong.
[00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:40.017]  Something's, you know, and I'm just like, listen, if I can't say somebody's 100% guilty of something, I'm not going to say it.
[00:27:40.017 --> 00:27:45.123]  We have a right to question things because throughout history, we've seen a lot of dirty stuff and a lot of staged things.
[00:27:46.906 --> 00:27:55.252]  The way God's plans work, the epiphany is I saw just an edge, just a little bit of God.
[00:27:55.252 --> 00:28:10.122]  Like you see in your child's eyes, I saw God's plan and God said, you watch, this is gonna be really rough, son, but you, we're all God's children, you're going to go through this and you're gonna be stronger.
[00:28:10.122 --> 00:28:14.825]  And it's happened before, but not this level.
[00:28:14.825 --> 00:28:15.965]  And then it was just like,
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.622]  Next-level understanding.
[00:28:21.622 --> 00:28:23.062]  It's amazing, and I'm very, very blessed.
[00:28:23.062 --> 00:28:23.562]  It's rough.
[00:28:23.562 --> 00:28:24.203]  It's hard.
[00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:26.544]  I know it's hard for you to defend me.
[00:28:26.544 --> 00:28:31.486]  But this is going to be a big test, and the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:28:31.486 --> 00:28:37.448]  And the epiphany was, these globalists are just as cold-blooded and evil as we thought.
[00:28:37.448 --> 00:28:44.532]  And we're just going to have to take them on and deal with them, because there's no other way.
[00:28:44.532 --> 00:28:44.912]  And that's it.
[00:28:45.919 --> 00:28:48.902]  The epiphany's much more deep than that, obviously.
[00:28:48.902 --> 00:28:53.026]  But, uh... This is a blessing.
[00:28:53.026 --> 00:28:56.449]  This is a blessing, this challenge, to fight this level of deception.
[00:28:56.449 --> 00:28:56.990]  I'm very honored.
[00:28:59.164 --> 00:29:01.506]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?

[00:29:04.408 --> 00:29:09.472]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[00:29:09.472 --> 00:29:16.657]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[00:29:16.657 --> 00:29:21.201]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:25.424]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[00:29:25.424 --> 00:29:28.567]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:31.189]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[00:29:31.189 --> 00:29:32.690]  Get sober now.

[00:30:56.972 --> 00:31:00.036]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[00:31:00.036 --> 00:31:10.651]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:12.474]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:31:12.694 --> 00:31:15.555]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:31:15.555 --> 00:31:17.056]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.056 --> 00:31:23.880]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.961]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:35.665]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:40.668]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[00:31:40.768 --> 00:31:52.476]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[00:33:02.754 --> 00:33:05.435]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.976 --> 00:33:25.197]  You've found it.
[00:33:25.197 --> 00:33:27.259]  The tip of the spear.
[00:33:27.259 --> 00:33:31.242]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:34.404]  Fifteen years in the academy.
[00:33:34.404 --> 00:33:37.647]  Like no cadet they ever seen.
[00:33:37.647 --> 00:33:41.250]  A man so hard his brains bleed out.
[00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.392]  When he speaks he never said it twice.
[00:33:44.392 --> 00:33:47.535]  They call him George, his last name is Fred.
[00:33:47.535 --> 00:33:50.837]  So break the law and you run out of debt.
[00:33:50.837 --> 00:33:52.599]  Truth and justice what he's fighting for.
[00:34:01.684 --> 00:34:02.525]  We are back.
[00:34:02.525 --> 00:34:03.486]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:34:03.486 --> 00:34:04.388]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:04.388 --> 00:34:09.094]  We are the most censored, most lied about, most demonized broadcast in the world.
[00:34:09.094 --> 00:34:11.417]  And if you study that, you'll understand how to defeat the globalists.
[00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:14.160]  I certainly have learned a lot going through this process.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.285]  It's really been a blessing, and I thank God for being put in this position.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:26.144]  I've prayed many times to be able to take on the globalists and reignite a renaissance worldwide and basically relaunch populism and nationalism.
[00:34:26.144 --> 00:34:36.789]  And I know that Infowars and our audience of activists are the detonator that has swept this movement to worldwide prominence and soon dominance.
[00:34:36.789 --> 00:34:39.631]  And that is why they're attempting to destroy the original
[00:34:40.905 --> 00:34:44.706]  Progenitors of this current mass wave of awakening.
[00:34:44.706 --> 00:34:47.186]  And we've got two special guests we're about to go to right now.
[00:34:47.186 --> 00:34:48.606]  One of them is Jack Posobiec.
[00:34:48.606 --> 00:34:53.847]  But there was a point I've been wanting to make about Sandy Hook forever that I haven't made.
[00:34:53.847 --> 00:34:55.047]  And really a statement on it.
[00:34:55.047 --> 00:34:58.528]  And I'm going to do that when we start the next hour.
[00:34:58.528 --> 00:35:09.370]  Because this whole Roku situation, which I guess means six in Japanese, is a window into how they're going to take everybody off the year.
[00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:10.826]  When they're done.
[00:35:10.826 --> 00:35:12.707]  And I mean basically even their liberal competition.
[00:35:12.707 --> 00:35:15.189]  This is authoritarianism.
[00:35:15.189 --> 00:35:26.054]  Once censorship starts, it always consolidates into one movie company, one theater company, one advertising company, and then very limited spots, total stagnation of culture.
[00:35:26.054 --> 00:35:27.155]  So that's where this is going.
[00:35:27.155 --> 00:35:37.800]  But, you notice out of all the Sandy Hook coverage, they will never, ever, let you hear a real quote, or something I said, or some jumbled jump shot video.
[00:35:39.133 --> 00:35:45.179]  I told Megyn Kelly I think Sandy Hook happened, and I'm sorry for the families, but I'm not the person that originally progenerated this.
[00:35:45.179 --> 00:35:48.142]  And so, why are you always bringing it up?
[00:35:48.142 --> 00:35:52.507]  And that's basically my statement, is that I'm going to make a Sandy Hook film now.
[00:35:52.507 --> 00:35:55.670]  I mean, and I say I'm going to make a film, and then I get busy and I don't do it.
[00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.253]  This is the film I'm making, not about Sandy Hook the shooting.
[00:35:59.346 --> 00:36:08.413]  But the clips of the news milking it for weeks and using the dead shoulder to try to blame it on the American people and take their guns, they're the ones profiting from it.
[00:36:08.413 --> 00:36:16.440]  And then the lawyers and all the rest of it, all the years of me saying I thought it happened, but having debates about it, then showing the clips that they showed distorted.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.641]  Imagine that.
[00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:19.982]  The anatomy of fraud.
[00:36:19.982 --> 00:36:20.323]  And then...
[00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:34.986]  The raw Megyn Kelly, what I really said to her, and all of that, and then my heartfelt letters and articles and videos to the families, years before they sued me, saying, hey, please stop saying I said your kids didn't die.
[00:36:34.986 --> 00:36:36.968]  Please stop saying I'm sending people to your house.
[00:36:36.968 --> 00:36:37.688]  I'm not doing that.
[00:36:37.688 --> 00:36:39.370]  I never did.
[00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:40.631]  Well, what did they say to Roku?
[00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:43.853]  Roku said yesterday, we're not going to take Mr. Jones down.
[00:36:43.853 --> 00:36:47.076]  We're just a platform for people to have a portal for their televisions and the Internet.
[00:36:49.633 --> 00:36:52.756]  You know, good old section of the Telecommunications Act.
[00:36:52.756 --> 00:37:05.789]  They stepped out of their protection and became curators now, and said, we had to take him down, he's dangerous, because the lawyers contacted him, they're in the Washington Post, and said, he's currently sending people to their homes and harassing them!
[00:37:05.789 --> 00:37:08.531]  He won't stop saying no one died, help us!
[00:37:08.531 --> 00:37:09.873]  It's like calling the police!
[00:37:11.454 --> 00:37:12.975]  Yes, they're coming!
[00:37:12.975 --> 00:37:13.595]  Yes, they're coming!
[00:37:13.595 --> 00:37:14.916]  He's sending them here!
[00:37:14.916 --> 00:37:15.657]  They're here right now!
[00:37:15.657 --> 00:37:16.417]  Everyone's in danger!
[00:37:16.417 --> 00:37:17.298]  You've got to take him off!
[00:37:17.298 --> 00:37:18.518]  He's saying no one died!
[00:37:18.518 --> 00:37:19.519]  He's sending harassers!
[00:37:19.519 --> 00:37:20.440]  We're in danger here!
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.100]  Please, help us!
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:26.123]  Get him off the air!
[00:37:26.123 --> 00:37:27.824]  Think about that.
[00:37:27.824 --> 00:37:30.306]  Think about the magnitude of that evil.
[00:37:30.306 --> 00:37:32.747]  Think about their will to carry that out and execute that.
[00:37:32.747 --> 00:37:33.708]  We're going to go to Jack Posobiec.
[00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.845]  I've been so flustered here, I haven't even combed my hair for it went on air.
[00:37:37.845 --> 00:37:41.129]  I'm just fighting constantly, but it just hit me.
[00:37:42.731 --> 00:37:45.293]  How sick this is.
[00:37:45.293 --> 00:37:47.034]  And America senses it's sick.
[00:37:47.034 --> 00:37:48.415]  It's synthetic.
[00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:49.775]  The shooting happened.
[00:37:49.775 --> 00:38:06.446]  But the syntheticness of the media and the hype and the manipulation of it and then the lawyers and the PR firms saying no kids died over and over again and Alex Jones is saying it and he's coming to their houses and there's investigators and that makes more and more investigators go to Connecticut.
[00:38:07.691 --> 00:38:23.823]  Just like they hype up mass shootings, the first one, you know, Columbine, and then it causes more and more, because crazy people go, I won't commit suicide by cop, I won't shoot myself, I'll go down at the school in a blaze of glory, selfish, evil glory, shooting my fellow classmates, and I'll get a bunch of attention.
[00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:29.588]  They always wear black trench coats, they always are devil worshippers, they always play shoot-em-up video games, they're always on Prozac drugs.
[00:38:29.588 --> 00:38:29.828]  Always!
[00:38:32.262 --> 00:38:45.696]  And the phenomenon, super rare before, became more prevalent, still very rare, but still horrible, and it's the media creating the whole thing, and the spectacle, and the copycats, knowingly!
[00:38:45.696 --> 00:38:48.578]  Every school year, they ramp it up, that it's all about to happen.
[00:38:48.578 --> 00:38:52.823]  Every school year, the mass shootings are coming, there's gonna be death, there's gonna be death, advertising it!
[00:38:54.548 --> 00:39:02.434]  We're gonna go to Jack Poselbit, but they learned decades ago that if one person jumped off the Empire State's building, suddenly 10 more would try, and they'd have to post cops up there.
[00:39:02.434 --> 00:39:03.275]  It's the same thing.
[00:39:03.275 --> 00:39:08.539]  You get one mass shooting, now you can cause a domino effect, and then blame the American people!
[00:39:08.539 --> 00:39:14.123]  And the American people are sick of being blamed for things they didn't do, so they started instinctively going, didn't happen!
[00:39:14.123 --> 00:39:14.503]  You know what?
[00:39:14.503 --> 00:39:15.444]  You're saying I did it?
[00:39:15.444 --> 00:39:15.985]  Didn't happen!
[00:39:15.985 --> 00:39:19.047]  Because I didn't kill the children, so it's a subconscious thing.
[00:39:19.047 --> 00:39:21.349]  Didn't happen, because I didn't do it!
[00:39:22.489 --> 00:39:25.330]  And I just feel really good about the truth and who I am and not what they've said.
[00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.530]  But this is dangerous.
[00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.971]  And what Roku did is dangerous because these lawyers have gone too far.
[00:39:29.971 --> 00:39:33.432]  They're in the news saying he's currently sending people to harass.
[00:39:33.432 --> 00:39:34.333]  He won't stop.
[00:39:34.333 --> 00:39:34.813]  Help us.
[00:39:34.813 --> 00:39:35.253]  Help us.
[00:39:35.253 --> 00:39:36.533]  It's creating a mass hysteria.
[00:39:36.533 --> 00:39:39.814]  Jack Posobiec, patriot, great American.
[00:39:39.814 --> 00:39:44.796]  He's on the one American news network that is just as good as Fox or better.
[00:39:44.796 --> 00:39:46.617]  I am so proud of the work they're doing.
[00:39:46.617 --> 00:39:50.138]  And I had this idea to call him today, but he's always too busy to come on.
[00:39:50.138 --> 00:39:50.758]  But then it hit me.
[00:39:54.358 --> 00:40:00.560]  They have cloud TV that's just as good or better than Roku and isn't censoring us, but I thought, I don't want to draw attention to that.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.540]  They'll probably kick me off that, but I said that, whatever.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.061]  But then they obviously have contacted us.
[00:40:04.061 --> 00:40:06.441]  We're going to talk about that now for this segment, a little bit of the next.
[00:40:06.441 --> 00:40:07.682]  We'll push our next guest back.
[00:40:07.682 --> 00:40:08.822]  He's going to be on as well.
[00:40:08.822 --> 00:40:12.503]  He was involved with the folks that made the new free app that wasn't even our page.
[00:40:13.383 --> 00:40:14.244]  I let fans do it.
[00:40:14.244 --> 00:40:15.806]  That's what got taken down yesterday.
[00:40:15.806 --> 00:40:18.670]  Our six-year-old Roku got taken down as well.
[00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.252]  So this is them deciding what you can see.
[00:40:20.252 --> 00:40:22.355]  Jack, thanks for holding while I've been ranting.
[00:40:22.355 --> 00:40:23.516]  I'm pretty wound up here.
[00:40:23.516 --> 00:40:25.539]  But what do you make of this whole situation?
[00:40:26.684 --> 00:40:48.369]  Well, Alex, I actually had the opportunity to speak with the owner of CloudTV, that's Cloud with a K, earlier today, because I was wondering, both as a consumer of media and as someone who is a reporter for One American News, which we also are carried by CloudTV, I wanted to say, OK, are you going to be following suit in terms of any of this?
[00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:51.290]  Are you going to be suspending InfoWars or anything like that?
[00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.750]  And what they said back to me was, Jack,
[00:40:53.556 --> 00:40:53.816]  We're good.
[00:41:10.652 --> 00:41:13.513]  To be available through the cloud TV packages.
[00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:15.354]  They have apps you can watch on your phone.
[00:41:15.354 --> 00:41:17.494]  You can watch on your tablet if you're on the go.
[00:41:17.494 --> 00:41:23.997]  They have a really interesting sort of time shifting option where you can watch watch back live broadcast that we're streaming.
[00:41:23.997 --> 00:41:25.817]  So my parents actually use it.
[00:41:25.817 --> 00:41:26.578]  They love it.
[00:41:26.578 --> 00:41:33.680]  I use it when I'm on the go to watch One American News to watch my own clips or switch over to InfoWars if there's something that was covered that I want to pull up.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.401]  And so cloud TV you know the one
[00:41:36.954 --> 00:41:37.534]  That's great.
[00:41:59.465 --> 00:42:05.110]  Because they view you as a threat to actual, you know, their own agenda.
[00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:07.031]  Well, Cloud TV is not playing that game.
[00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:11.575]  Cloud TV is going to allow it to be on and continue to be on.
[00:42:11.575 --> 00:42:15.778]  Now, One American News, I believe, is still on Roku as well.
[00:42:15.778 --> 00:42:16.839]  But who knows?
[00:42:16.839 --> 00:42:18.761]  It wouldn't surprise me if they come for us next.
[00:42:19.741 --> 00:42:21.322]  There's another phenomenon here too.
[00:42:21.322 --> 00:42:34.387]  Our app that just so happened to be launched a few weeks before the total ban back in August of InfoWars went to number one in news and in the top ten total and number one trending.
[00:42:34.387 --> 00:42:37.288]  We literally had millions of downloads and so what do they do?
[00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:38.549]  They just deleted it.
[00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:41.550]  We're still on Google Play for now but again
[00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.513]  We're being penalized for being number one.
[00:42:44.513 --> 00:42:47.837]  And yes, I watch cloud TV over the internet.
[00:42:47.837 --> 00:42:51.783]  I'm going to put the boxes in my house and Roku is coming out.
[00:42:51.783 --> 00:42:53.385]  We've been on Roku for almost seven years.
[00:42:53.385 --> 00:42:54.566]  Not a problem.
[00:42:54.566 --> 00:42:56.789]  But, you see, they lied about us and had us removed.
[00:42:56.789 --> 00:42:57.951]  We'll be right back with Jack Posobiec.

[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.322]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.322 --> 00:44:08.284]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:45:08.538 --> 00:45:10.000]  Believe me, I know.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.305]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:45:14.305 --> 00:45:17.769]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.

[00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:40.107]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:06.842]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:06.842 --> 00:46:11.745]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:11.745 --> 00:46:15.547]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:15.547 --> 00:46:23.612]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:24.532 --> 00:46:27.334]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.

[00:46:34.598 --> 00:46:38.561]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.

[00:46:44.504 --> 00:46:47.546]  Call and talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[00:46:47.546 --> 00:46:49.047]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:49.047 --> 00:46:52.089]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[00:46:55.236 --> 00:47:03.760]  And the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.402]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:32.364 --> 00:47:33.725]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:39.408]  to 3 p.m., you can find Central Standard Time, the most demonized, lied-about broadcast in the world.
[00:47:39.408 --> 00:47:52.755]  And you know, I've gone from, long before they sued me, asking the Democrats that handle the Sandy Hook families to, hey, stop saying I said nobody died and stop saying I'm sending people to people's houses.
[00:47:52.755 --> 00:47:54.036]  That's making people do that.
[00:47:54.036 --> 00:47:55.037]  And you're doing it in my name.
[00:47:55.037 --> 00:47:55.397]  Stop it!
[00:47:56.377 --> 00:48:00.019]  And they're like, no, we're not going to stop anything and we're going to keep saying it in your name.
[00:48:00.019 --> 00:48:01.879]  But if they're doing it in my name, it means they're doing it.
[00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:05.041]  And it was that that was part of the epiphany.
[00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:11.043]  It's how everything the globalists do is they'll use some human shields like the families of Sandy Hook.
[00:48:11.043 --> 00:48:22.908]  Just like, you know, Al Qaeda will use human shields of his lawyers and people and they will sit there and throw these people out in front of them and then they'll say all these horrible things that you're saying and they're the ones saying it.
[00:48:24.299 --> 00:48:25.680]  And people are like, yeah, that's obvious.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.220]  I know, but it's crazy.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.561]  So this morning I thought of Jack Posobiec.
[00:48:29.561 --> 00:48:32.602]  I thought of One American News Network that's exploding.
[00:48:32.602 --> 00:48:34.482]  I hear buzz about it everywhere.
[00:48:34.482 --> 00:48:42.585]  And I thought about how I talked to the owner of Cloud TV, who also owns many of the channels that are on there, and it's giving Roku a big run for its money.
[00:48:42.585 --> 00:48:44.886]  Roku has decided to flush the First Amendment down the toilet.
[00:48:46.172 --> 00:48:51.613]  Our app that some fans made that I authorized in one day went to the top of trending.
[00:48:51.613 --> 00:48:56.475]  There's articles about it at Big League Politics and other sites linked up at Infowars.com.
[00:48:56.475 --> 00:49:05.377]  So again, my crime was becoming popular, like we did number one in news in just a few weeks on Apple last year, and so they just banned it.
[00:49:05.377 --> 00:49:09.338]  Tim Cook said, well, we just made the decision because everyone agrees he's bad.
[00:49:09.338 --> 00:49:11.879]  No, everyone said number one, dummy.
[00:49:13.186 --> 00:49:25.354]  So see, if the heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali, formerly Cassius Clay, knocks you out, I'm gonna knock you out!
[00:49:25.354 --> 00:49:26.774]  Mama said knock you out!
[00:49:26.774 --> 00:49:29.856]  We knock you guys on your asses politically.
[00:49:29.856 --> 00:49:34.039]  We clean your little teleprompter reading clocks.
[00:49:34.039 --> 00:49:36.961]  And so your response is, don't let Alex Jones
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.860]  And his race car on the track.
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.961]  I mean, you know, I'm sweating right now, even though it's 65 degrees in here.
[00:49:43.961 --> 00:49:48.042]  You know, I don't sweat in person, even hot outside, I don't sweat that much.
[00:49:48.042 --> 00:49:51.762]  I get so excited when I talk about freedom that I start sweating.
[00:49:51.762 --> 00:49:55.063]  You think those little people with weak heartbeats?
[00:49:55.063 --> 00:49:57.383]  No, my heart's boom, it's big.
[00:49:57.383 --> 00:49:59.144]  It's blasting blood through my body.
[00:49:59.144 --> 00:50:00.404]  I'm alive, baby.
[00:50:00.404 --> 00:50:03.184]  And I'm telling the truth, and I believe in you, and I'm real.
[00:50:03.184 --> 00:50:05.905]  And everybody deep down who's got discernment knows that.
[00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:08.736]  Alex Jones is the real McCoy.
[00:50:08.736 --> 00:50:10.458]  Alex Jones is a genuine article.
[00:50:10.458 --> 00:50:14.343]  I'm committed until death against these people, and I'm never backing down.
[00:50:14.343 --> 00:50:17.246]  And it's that spirit drives them crazy.
[00:50:17.246 --> 00:50:18.267]  Going back to Jack Posobiec.
[00:50:18.267 --> 00:50:18.448]  Jack?
[00:50:19.685 --> 00:50:23.688]  One American News, I mean, I've gushingly said I want to promote it.
[00:50:23.688 --> 00:50:32.296]  So the fact that the owner of Cloud TV, I know he's a big fan of One American News because he owns it, I know that he wants to work.
[00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:34.037]  So I'm glad this is going on.
[00:50:34.037 --> 00:50:37.740]  I dropped the ball six months ago when we talked during the platform and he wanted to help.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.042]  And so tell people, because look, our listeners, I have the app.
[00:50:41.363 --> 00:50:42.383]  I mean, I have it on a computer at home.
[00:50:42.383 --> 00:50:43.664]  I need to get it on my phone.
[00:50:43.664 --> 00:50:44.844]  I mean, I get busy.
[00:50:44.844 --> 00:50:46.724]  But everybody needs to get the box.
[00:50:46.724 --> 00:50:47.764]  And you're not an advertiser.
[00:50:47.764 --> 00:50:49.125]  This is just happening.
[00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:50.765]  So, so, how do people get it?
[00:50:50.765 --> 00:50:58.227]  They go to CloudTV with a K, K-L-O-W-D, and you get the CloudTV box.
[00:50:58.227 --> 00:50:59.687]  And it is amazing.
[00:50:59.687 --> 00:51:08.689]  And I want to see this absolutely dominate the Libtards over there at, over there at their little purple, whatever it's called, you know,
[00:51:09.369 --> 00:51:10.150]  Roku.
[00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.631]  So I've been ranting, you've got the floor in the next seven minutes.
[00:51:12.631 --> 00:51:15.693]  Tell us what else you think is going to come out of all this.
[00:51:15.693 --> 00:51:16.594]  Well, Alex, that's right.
[00:51:16.594 --> 00:51:22.858]  And just looking at the website there is there's a couple of different versions of the box that are available for people.
[00:51:22.858 --> 00:51:28.502]  You can get a box that has Wi-Fi set up so you can hook it up wirelessly to your TV.
[00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:32.925]  There's also a box that hooks up directly and it's got there's two versions, right?
[00:51:32.925 --> 00:51:34.106]  There's the one that hooks up directly.
[00:51:34.506 --> 00:51:36.806]  And then there's the other one that actually has a DVR support.
[00:51:36.806 --> 00:51:39.847]  So that DVR one, you can record whatever you want.
[00:51:39.847 --> 00:51:42.547]  You can watch your local channels for free.
[00:51:42.547 --> 00:51:44.828]  You can basically pull up everything that you want.
[00:51:44.828 --> 00:51:48.288]  You can run your Hulu through there, your Amazon Prime, your Netflix.
[00:51:48.288 --> 00:51:52.129]  So in addition to you're getting One American News, you're getting InfoWars.
[00:51:52.129 --> 00:51:53.689]  So you've got it all in one place.
[00:51:53.689 --> 00:51:56.730]  And I think it's like over 80 channels for like $10 a month.
[00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:00.330]  Way, way cheaper than anybody else is offering out there.
[00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:03.091]  And it's the stuff that you want and not the stuff that you don't, right?
[00:52:03.491 --> 00:52:25.372]  So it's so it's easy and more and more as the censorship continues and as the big tech Silicon Valley censorship I mean that we talked about the Democrats going down to Puerto Rico recently I reported that big tech was a big funder of that trip of the Democrats down in Puerto Rico because they're huge funders to that block pack the super pack that was able to sponsor that trip
[00:52:25.672 --> 00:52:26.873]  Facebook was down there.
[00:52:26.873 --> 00:52:28.074]  Their lobbyists were down there.
[00:52:28.074 --> 00:52:32.156]  A lot of Silicon Valley was down there talking to Democrats who are now controlling the House.
[00:52:32.156 --> 00:52:34.438]  And you know that that's exactly what they want.
[00:52:34.438 --> 00:52:40.502]  You know that they want people who have alternate opinions, who have other sources of information out there, to be censored.
[00:52:40.502 --> 00:52:45.385]  And they're working hand and glove with the Democrat Party, the new majority in the House.
[00:52:45.385 --> 00:52:47.667]  They're going right to Silicon Valley and saying, what do you want?
[00:52:47.667 --> 00:52:48.327]  What is your wish?
[00:52:48.327 --> 00:52:49.188]  You know, you're sponsoring our
[00:52:49.668 --> 00:52:55.430]  Beautiful trip to Puerto Rico, whatever we can do for you, we'll let you do it and give you the legal cover that you need.
[00:52:55.430 --> 00:53:06.052]  The lack of regulation, the lack of oversight that we should be getting from any communications platform in Washington, D.C., they're giving them a free run because they're all bought and sold by Silicon Valley.
[00:53:06.052 --> 00:53:11.514]  And I know I'm focusing on the Democrats, but there's plenty of Republicans and Independents that are involved in that as well.
[00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:13.430]  And you're an expert on China.
[00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.251]  You've also been in Naval Intelligence.
[00:53:15.251 --> 00:53:23.114]  You've lived in China and done a lot of important work that you obviously can't get into, but Silicon Valley is dominated by Chinese money.
[00:53:23.114 --> 00:53:25.314]  Hollywood is 90% now Chinese.
[00:53:25.314 --> 00:53:28.736]  That's Wall Street Journal, six, seven years after I first said it.
[00:53:28.736 --> 00:53:31.197]  When I first said China runs Hollywood, people said, you're nuts.
[00:53:31.197 --> 00:53:33.137]  No, they now own it.
[00:53:33.137 --> 00:53:38.739]  Six of the eight big production houses, Trump blocked them buying American Bandstand, which sounds like it's not big.
[00:53:38.739 --> 00:53:39.859]  It's a huge production house.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.200]  This is a war.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:46.861]  So it's not just Apple and Google moving to China, helping censor.
[00:53:46.861 --> 00:53:48.182]  They're doing it here.
[00:53:48.182 --> 00:53:50.282]  They're bringing Chinese-style net censorship here.
[00:53:50.282 --> 00:53:59.344]  And I know that Google is buying the average House member for about $10,000 a year, $20,000 for the two years they're in.
[00:53:59.344 --> 00:54:03.365]  Even senior committee heads are only getting about $40,000 every election.
[00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.566]  It's not even that much money.
[00:54:05.566 --> 00:54:07.566]  That's the joke of it all, right?
[00:54:07.566 --> 00:54:10.027]  Our politicians are being bought and sold for
[00:54:10.387 --> 00:54:11.828]  For not even really all that much money.
[00:54:11.828 --> 00:54:14.751]  $25,000, I think, with Jerry Nadler.
[00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:17.273]  You know, just a couple thousand here, a couple thousand there.
[00:54:17.273 --> 00:54:17.813]  And it's enough.
[00:54:17.813 --> 00:54:21.677]  It's enough for them to do their bidding, to push their agenda, to not really ask them serious questions.
[00:54:21.677 --> 00:54:22.858]  So this is the big national security issue.
[00:54:22.858 --> 00:54:23.919]  Let me ask you that then.
[00:54:23.919 --> 00:54:25.680]  This is a national security issue.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.162]  Hardcore Soviet-style censorship.
[00:54:28.162 --> 00:54:29.403]  Chai combat.
[00:54:29.403 --> 00:54:31.385]  Walking in, taking over Congress.
[00:54:31.385 --> 00:54:32.626]  This is an emergency.
[00:54:32.626 --> 00:54:35.449]  What is the President... We're going to talk about foreign influence, right?
[00:54:35.449 --> 00:54:36.830]  They talk about foreign influence.
[00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:43.053]  Uh, when it's fake in terms of Trump and Russia, but they never want to talk about the actual foreign influence of China.
[00:54:43.053 --> 00:54:52.598]  They never want to talk about the influence of Qatar, all the money that's floating around in Washington, D.C., the Chinese money floating around in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, that then trickles down to Washington, D.C.
[00:54:52.598 --> 00:54:54.099]  They don't want to talk about that at all.
[00:54:54.099 --> 00:55:01.043]  They want you focused on Russia, you know, which has an economy the size of less than New York City, right?
[00:55:01.043 --> 00:55:05.565]  They want you wrapped in some sort of like Tom Clancy fantasy novel.
[00:55:05.825 --> 00:55:09.307]  Well, they're not looking at the actual foreign influence that's going on in China.
[00:55:09.307 --> 00:55:14.649]  They've got this company Huawei now, which is really an arm of the Chinese state security.
[00:55:14.649 --> 00:55:18.711]  Everyone who's using a Huawei phone, China's just listening to that.
[00:55:18.711 --> 00:55:20.191]  And these phones are getting really big.
[00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:24.393]  They're focusing on Europe right now, but Huawei phones are going to come to the United States.
[00:55:24.393 --> 00:55:25.914]  And Apple knows this.
[00:55:25.914 --> 00:55:30.716]  And that's why Apple is working closely with Huawei, because they don't want to have to fight Huawei in the U.S.
[00:55:30.716 --> 00:55:32.457]  market until they have to.
[00:55:32.897 --> 00:55:33.217]  Thank you.
[00:55:51.092 --> 00:55:55.054]  It's incredible, and Trump is moving on them on that level, so that's important.
[00:55:55.054 --> 00:55:59.796]  Jack Posobiec, please join us again very soon to get into China, to get into what's happening on Capitol Hill.
[00:55:59.796 --> 00:56:07.800]  I know you're going to grab some clips from this and put it on a report for One American News Network, but everyone needs to go to Cloud TV.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.041]  There's also a phone number there.
[00:56:09.041 --> 00:56:10.622]  We should get the phone number and give that out for folks.
[00:56:10.902 --> 00:56:23.613]  So they can get it, plug it in, it's got Wi-Fi, or it's got plugged right into the box, and it is extremely amazing, way better than Roku, and it's supporting freedom, and it's getting bigger all the time.
[00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:26.556]  This is absolutely essential, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:26.556 --> 00:56:28.677]  Thank you so much, Jack Pasovic.
[00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:29.338]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:56:29.338 --> 00:56:30.639]  Talk to you soon, man.
[00:56:30.639 --> 00:56:35.804]  Now, one door closes, another door opens.
[00:56:35.804 --> 00:56:38.366]  I'm not here trying to climb a ladder to see how much money I can make.
[00:56:39.372 --> 00:56:45.776]  If I can make money to fight the globalists, then I'll do it if it's moral.
[00:56:45.776 --> 00:56:48.979]  But I won't do anything if it's screwing somebody over.
[00:56:48.979 --> 00:56:50.860]  I want to explain something.
[00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.983]  The globalists go from super evil to absolutely pure satanists.
[00:56:54.983 --> 00:56:55.963]  Child molesters.
[00:56:55.963 --> 00:56:57.044]  Child killers.
[00:56:57.044 --> 00:56:59.366]  That's all coming out in the news.
[00:56:59.366 --> 00:57:03.849]  You sign on with them, you're signing on with the act of hurting children.
[00:57:04.963 --> 00:57:06.144]  The act of corrupting them.
[00:57:06.144 --> 00:57:09.547]  And now they're sick evils about to come out in the open fully.
[00:57:09.547 --> 00:57:13.770]  That's why I've got to be off the air because it validates everything we've said.
[00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:22.478]  So this evil globalist system that hurts children finds some story we've covered to twist and say I'm hurting children or families of dead children to try to bring us down.
[00:57:23.527 --> 00:57:27.228]  Just remember, I get so fired up fighting the globalists that I haven't plugged once this hour.

[00:57:53.291 --> 00:57:59.015]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:57:59.015 --> 00:58:06.880]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:10.042]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.

[00:58:50.169 --> 00:58:52.871]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:58:52.871 --> 00:58:59.216]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:58:59.216 --> 00:59:00.957]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[00:59:00.957 --> 00:59:07.542]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.

[00:59:28.355 --> 00:59:33.378]  With powerful ingredients combined to help support the mind and body, Happies
[00:59:33.638 --> 00:59:36.099]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:25.167]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:28.790]  They say I'm too Goku for Roku, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.481]  I am not a big anime fan.
[01:00:32.481 --> 01:00:36.102]  I don't really follow it, but they put me in a lot of them, so I guess I am a fan now.
[01:00:36.102 --> 01:00:39.383]  So that's a weird, archaic... What do you say, archaic?
[01:00:39.383 --> 01:00:46.126]  It's an interesting piece of factoid lore.
[01:00:46.126 --> 01:00:48.487]  All right.
[01:00:48.487 --> 01:00:51.968]  There's so many angles, there's so many facets to this.
[01:00:51.968 --> 01:00:56.730]  The free press, so-called, land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:59.031]  Papers in Germany, England, the US, Canada.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.180]  Yay!
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.061]  Take Alex Jones off!
[01:01:03.061 --> 01:01:04.421]  He's evil!
[01:01:04.421 --> 01:01:04.981]  He's bad!
[01:01:04.981 --> 01:01:07.501]  He's sending people to be mean to children!
[01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:11.082]  And then the lawyers use my voice to say things I haven't ever said.
[01:01:11.082 --> 01:01:20.144]  It was kind of a... I mean, I already knew that, but it was like really an awakening that we keep doing videos and sending them letters and responding and saying, stop, stop.
[01:01:20.144 --> 01:01:21.844]  But they're like, nope, we're not going to stop.
[01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:25.585]  So, OK, well, I'm going to have to do something.
[01:01:25.585 --> 01:01:26.725]  Leave it at that.
[01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:29.486]  So that's where all this is going.
[01:01:30.598 --> 01:01:33.501]  And then you've got Roku saying, we believe in the First Amendment.
[01:01:33.501 --> 01:01:42.791]  And then hours later, taking down the app, it's like a severed head or something that they're shaking around like, you know, pygmies or folks in Afghanistan playing polo with human heads.
[01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:43.351]  We got him!
[01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:43.852]  We got him!
[01:01:43.852 --> 01:01:46.395]  He spent all the money on this app!
[01:01:46.395 --> 01:01:47.236]  And we took him down.
[01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:49.978]  I heard about it a few months ago.
[01:01:49.978 --> 01:01:53.182]  Hey, there's some veterans and some patriots building a first class app.
[01:01:55.831 --> 01:01:57.232]  Or paid for Roku.
[01:01:57.232 --> 01:01:59.894]  And we were getting over a million viewers a week on Roku.
[01:01:59.894 --> 01:02:01.275]  So that's great.
[01:02:01.275 --> 01:02:05.118]  Launches one day, goes to number one.
[01:02:05.118 --> 01:02:09.862]  And in the trending and they just went to the front page and it freaked out the left.
[01:02:09.862 --> 01:02:16.107]  So they all jumped in action and it made the Sandy Hook lawyers just go into like piranha mode, just feeding frenzy.
[01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:17.909]  And they were just like, we're under attack!
[01:02:17.909 --> 01:02:19.170]  He's sending people right now!
[01:02:20.444 --> 01:02:21.265]  Those are the quotes!
[01:02:21.265 --> 01:02:21.985]  Help the children!
[01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:22.566]  He's sending them!
[01:02:22.566 --> 01:02:23.287]  The parents!
[01:02:23.287 --> 01:02:23.567]  God!
[01:02:23.567 --> 01:02:24.508]  Please, no, God!
[01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:25.308]  He's on the air!
[01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:28.711]  And I'm like, of course, never said that, and I'm not saying it currently.
[01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:32.675]  And they're like, we're sorry, we didn't know he was trying to send people to hurt people.
[01:02:32.675 --> 01:02:33.175]  He's down!
[01:02:33.175 --> 01:02:34.096]  He's down!
[01:02:34.096 --> 01:02:36.679]  That's the real defamation right there.
[01:02:36.679 --> 01:02:38.700]  They're like, we want you off the air!
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:43.585]  And so we're gonna keep saying you're doing this currently, and I'm just like, wow, you just crossed the Rubicon.
[01:02:45.509 --> 01:02:48.230]  You just crossed the Rubicon in a massive way.
[01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:55.973]  Now, he's been with us for the next 30 minutes, and we've got Tom Pappet, who does an amazing job, manages a TV station, and has his own successful show.
[01:02:55.973 --> 01:03:05.357]  He's on Twitter, at RealGETrump, at RealGETrump, and on Facebook, he is GodEmperorTrumpOfficial.
[01:03:05.357 --> 01:03:06.418]  So we should have introduced him that way.
[01:03:06.418 --> 01:03:08.519]  I know I'm ranting, I'm going to shut up and let him talk.
[01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:09.739]  What do you make of all this?
[01:03:09.739 --> 01:03:11.060]  You also write for Big League Politics.
[01:03:12.543 --> 01:03:19.648]  You know, Alex, I think what this is is a brilliant example of how the left wing marches in lockstep with their allies in the media.
[01:03:19.648 --> 01:03:20.848]  You know, I'm convinced.
[01:03:20.848 --> 01:03:22.489]  We had lots of downloads on the app.
[01:03:22.489 --> 01:03:23.650]  The guy who made it talked to me.
[01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:25.951]  He said there were thousands of downloads on day one.
[01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:28.093]  It was extremely successful with no marketing.
[01:03:28.593 --> 01:03:31.796]  But I'm convinced that the left stalks you, Alex.
[01:03:31.796 --> 01:03:33.017]  I think they've been watching you.
[01:03:33.017 --> 01:03:34.458]  They have a Google Alert set up.
[01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:49.950]  They found out about this app and they called in all of their allies because it was every single outlet from the Daily Beast to the Huffington Post to the New York Times to the Washington Post all within a couple hours before anybody on the right even knew about this app.
[01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:50.671]  We had the left
[01:03:51.331 --> 01:03:55.054]  Rioting in the streets, practically, saying that Alex Jones needs to be pulled off Roku.
[01:03:55.054 --> 01:03:59.998]  So, I think the real interesting thing here is they played their card a little too strong.
[01:03:59.998 --> 01:04:01.359]  They showed their hand, I think.
[01:04:01.359 --> 01:04:03.941]  We now know that this is all about censoring you.
[01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:06.663]  It's all about economically strangling InfoWars.
[01:04:06.663 --> 01:04:08.564]  There's no grassroots movement.
[01:04:08.564 --> 01:04:12.467]  There's no people that are concerned you're profiting off the lives of dead children.
[01:04:12.467 --> 01:04:20.193]  That's all just a fictitious nonsense that the leftist media created so they could have an excuse to go after you, which is, I think, what this is all about.
[01:04:20.393 --> 01:04:22.915]  And by the way, you're a better talk show host than I am in many ways.
[01:04:22.915 --> 01:04:24.716]  You kind of leave a little to be discovered.
[01:04:24.716 --> 01:04:26.037]  I always say it up front.
[01:04:26.037 --> 01:04:33.161]  They're in the Washington Post and New York Times, how they blueprinted it, how Jack Darcy at CNN quarterbacked it.
[01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:38.164]  But then they sent in the Sandy Hook lawyers to say, I was coming after the families right now.
[01:04:38.164 --> 01:04:39.225]  You've got to get him off us.
[01:04:39.225 --> 01:04:40.346]  The wolf's at the door.
[01:04:40.346 --> 01:04:41.266]  Call the SWAT team.
[01:04:41.266 --> 01:04:42.187]  God, Jones, stop it!
[01:04:42.187 --> 01:04:42.527]  No!
[01:04:42.527 --> 01:04:42.967]  He's here!
[01:04:42.967 --> 01:04:43.488]  Come on!
[01:04:43.488 --> 01:04:43.808]  Ah!
[01:04:43.808 --> 01:04:44.348]  Ah!
[01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:45.749]  Imperial troops went to the base!
[01:04:45.749 --> 01:04:48.010]  And they're like, we better take them down!
[01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:48.231]  Hell!
[01:04:49.091 --> 01:04:51.933]  Not if it was true, but hey, so what?
[01:04:51.933 --> 01:04:53.595]  It might cost money if we don't, right?
[01:04:53.595 --> 01:04:54.736]  Gotta get Alex gone.
[01:04:54.736 --> 01:04:58.459]  Yeah, gotta get rid of him.
[01:04:58.459 --> 01:05:00.820]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:07.426]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:05:07.426 --> 01:05:11.909]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[01:06:11.495 --> 01:06:14.117]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:14.117 --> 01:06:15.518]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:26.072 --> 01:06:34.541]  We're now into the second hour of the worldwide broadcast, and you know, I didn't invent gonzo journalism like Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:40.406]  But you could say Alex Jones is the king of unintentional gonzo journalism.
[01:06:40.406 --> 01:06:45.331]  Because any subject, anything we do, instantly the story becomes Alex Jones.
[01:06:46.209 --> 01:06:55.571]  Which they've kind of created their own monster, because I can go to any press conference, any public event, and just take it over in minutes, and they don't know what to do.
[01:06:55.571 --> 01:07:13.515]  Because we were huge with our awesome audience, God bless them, we wouldn't be here without them, trying to change the world, and changing the world, but with the left, they just ignored us, but now they've turned me into Godzilla, Mothra, King Kong, all at once, and I've got to be destroyed.
[01:07:13.515 --> 01:07:13.875]  And so,
[01:07:14.972 --> 01:07:18.194]  A new fan app that we authorized in like a two-minute meeting.
[01:07:18.194 --> 01:07:20.095]  I said, sure, yeah, let folks build a fan app.
[01:07:20.095 --> 01:07:20.715]  Fine, great.
[01:07:20.715 --> 01:07:24.317]  For Roku, we have an old, cruddy one that we built seven years ago.
[01:07:24.317 --> 01:07:26.759]  And when I say cruddy, I mean it was seven years ago.
[01:07:26.759 --> 01:07:33.062]  And it had over a million views a week, but it just had some of the videos that got fed to it, and it was all broken.
[01:07:33.062 --> 01:07:36.344]  Well, this new one started shooting to the top.
[01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:39.406]  And so it was on the front page because it was most popular.
[01:07:39.406 --> 01:07:40.906]  That's how their algorithm works.
[01:07:40.906 --> 01:07:43.248]  And so it was red alert.
[01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:48.193]  They don't want to see something in the left that, you know, that's there.
[01:07:48.193 --> 01:07:54.959]  And so it went into overdrive, and all this happened, and then the Washington Post says they called in the cavalry.
[01:07:54.959 --> 01:08:11.513]  When Roku said, we're not going to ban Jones, he doesn't do anything illegal, we're just a platform, a window to the internet for your television, they called in the Sandy Hook lawyers who said, and I've got the quotes here, that Jones is harassing and sending people to families' homes right now.
[01:08:11.513 --> 01:08:12.393]  Clear and present danger.
[01:08:13.444 --> 01:08:15.665]  You know, the robbers are at the door, basically.
[01:08:15.665 --> 01:08:16.046]  Alert!
[01:08:16.046 --> 01:08:16.346]  Alert!
[01:08:16.346 --> 01:08:17.867]  We have an emergency!
[01:08:17.867 --> 01:08:20.668]  Never said go to their houses.
[01:08:20.668 --> 01:08:22.850]  Never said do any of that.
[01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:27.673]  But they keep saying it in my voice, which is extremely actionable.
[01:08:27.673 --> 01:08:28.933]  But they can't help it.
[01:08:28.933 --> 01:08:30.254]  They can't stop doing it.
[01:08:30.254 --> 01:08:42.762]  Because the Democratic Party uses the poor children and the families that have been traumatized, that they've gotten into their system, in my view, to come after me and to go at me and to say things
[01:08:43.934 --> 01:08:47.255]  In my name, that they say.
[01:08:47.255 --> 01:08:51.297]  So my identity has been stolen by the Democratic Party and the spin machine.
[01:08:51.297 --> 01:08:56.519]  Because when Hillary Clinton gave that dark heart speech, and she said, I am to blame.
[01:08:56.519 --> 01:08:59.040]  And that Alex Jones is the most horrible person in the world.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.741]  What did Cenk Uygur, the young turd, say?
[01:09:01.741 --> 01:09:07.663]  He said Alex Jones is the worst person in the world for saying George Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[01:09:07.663 --> 01:09:11.745]  He said he was a hero that was captured by the Nazis.
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:19.725]  I mean, I guess you could say Hitler was captured by the Nazis.
[01:09:19.725 --> 01:09:22.648]  So, by that extension.
[01:09:22.648 --> 01:09:26.172]  So, that's on 60 Minutes, that's on NPR, that's in magazine interviews.
[01:09:26.172 --> 01:09:26.873]  He did it!
[01:09:26.873 --> 01:09:27.374]  He said it!
[01:09:28.897 --> 01:09:31.460]  Oh, but the Nazi collaborator, he's not bad.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:37.728]  Not the media promoting dead children constantly and demonizing the Second Amendment and getting ratings out of it.
[01:09:37.728 --> 01:09:39.991]  Oh no, I'm the one that profited from it.
[01:09:39.991 --> 01:09:42.595]  And I guess they kind of think I must be like them.
[01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:46.439]  Because in this latest thing they're like, show us all the marketing material about Sandy Hook.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:51.443]  Oh, you mean how the stations didn't like us saying it was staged and I lost stations?
[01:09:51.443 --> 01:09:53.864]  You mean, there isn't marketing material.
[01:09:53.864 --> 01:09:57.886]  I get a piece of paper about what I think about something and I talk to a camera.
[01:09:57.886 --> 01:09:59.087]  There's your marketing around here.
[01:09:59.087 --> 01:10:01.368]  That's your marketing department.
[01:10:01.368 --> 01:10:03.590]  I come up with the basic designs of the banners and stuff.
[01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:04.670]  Probably not the best at it.
[01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:05.851]  We have a great crew over there.
[01:10:05.851 --> 01:10:08.293]  But let me go to our guest.
[01:10:08.293 --> 01:10:10.554]  It's the epiphany that
[01:10:11.994 --> 01:10:15.717]  I'm not looking forward to all this, but I think the truth's going to come out in the end.
[01:10:15.717 --> 01:10:23.523]  Because they've overplayed, they've gone so far, and they're using me, once the precedent's set, to take everybody else off.
[01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:25.364]  And that's what's so dangerous here.
[01:10:25.364 --> 01:10:27.666]  It's like Congressman Steve King.
[01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:29.567]  Western civilization's great.
[01:10:29.567 --> 01:10:30.268]  We should be proud of it.
[01:10:30.268 --> 01:10:31.929]  We should teach it in civics.
[01:10:31.929 --> 01:10:33.790]  We should have English be the national language.
[01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:35.131]  If you don't have that, you die.
[01:10:35.131 --> 01:10:35.872]  That's basic.
[01:10:37.964 --> 01:10:39.565]  Boilerplate stuff you gotta have.
[01:10:39.565 --> 01:10:41.626]  Like bulkheads on submarines.
[01:10:41.626 --> 01:10:43.206]  You can't have screen doors.
[01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:44.187]  Okay?
[01:10:44.187 --> 01:10:44.907]  It's like oxygen.
[01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.048]  You gotta have it.
[01:10:46.048 --> 01:10:52.730]  They scramble this quote where he says, you know, don't compare nationalism and Western civilization to white supremacy.
[01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:54.631]  They're not.
[01:10:54.631 --> 01:10:58.573]  And they call that defending... Well, they say Trump started it for saying nationalism.
[01:10:58.573 --> 01:11:00.094]  This is what these people are doing.
[01:11:00.094 --> 01:11:02.895]  And you talk to the average liberal leftist.
[01:11:02.895 --> 01:11:04.476]  They are mental patients.
[01:11:04.476 --> 01:11:07.117]  The only followers of this are a bunch of mental patients
[01:11:08.171 --> 01:11:12.481]  Whose only power is getting in everybody's face and trying to control the narrative.
[01:11:12.481 --> 01:11:14.305]  And trying to make us their slaves.
[01:11:14.305 --> 01:11:16.229]  Trying to turn the reality upside down.
[01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:24.976]  And because the globalists are solo sociopaths, they always try to find a cause or some children or something they can use to make them look good.
[01:11:24.976 --> 01:11:30.078]  But in reality, they don't care about the deadly vaccines or the GMOs or the millions killed by radical Islam.
[01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:32.519]  They don't care about any of that real stuff.
[01:11:32.519 --> 01:11:35.379]  They don't care about the migrant children with all the diseases bringing it into the U.S.
[01:11:35.379 --> 01:11:36.160]  and the schools.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.200]  They care about power!
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.882]  Going back to our guest, Tom Papert, who's awesome, a little wound up today, at Twitter,
[01:11:45.433 --> 01:11:46.354]  Real.
[01:11:46.354 --> 01:11:47.414]  G.E.
[01:11:47.414 --> 01:11:47.895]  Trump.
[01:11:47.895 --> 01:11:50.036]  And of course, God Emperor Trump official on Facebook.
[01:11:50.036 --> 01:11:50.757]  He is awesome.
[01:11:50.757 --> 01:11:52.258]  He's also a radio and TV host.
[01:11:52.258 --> 01:11:56.220]  I'm going to shut up now for this segment and the next because you've made some incredible observations.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.881]  And again, I don't want to talk about myself all day.
[01:11:57.881 --> 01:12:06.407]  This is like a window into the world, though, how they're doing this, how they're getting more crazed, how they're getting, though, more territory every day, how they're destroying rights and freedom everywhere.
[01:12:06.407 --> 01:12:08.288]  We sit back and go, my God, this is insane.
[01:12:08.288 --> 01:12:09.129]  But you know what?
[01:12:09.129 --> 01:12:09.969]  They're taking over.
[01:12:09.969 --> 01:12:10.610]  What do we need to do?
[01:12:12.099 --> 01:12:15.221]  Well, one thing that I want to point out is they're making this about you.
[01:12:15.221 --> 01:12:16.962]  They're making you talk about yourself.
[01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:30.551]  You know, I honestly doubt, Alex, that you would have ever uttered the word Sandy Hook over the past probably three or four years had it not been for all these lawsuits, had it not been for all these false quotes that they attribute to you and false actions that they attribute to you.
[01:12:30.551 --> 01:12:32.753]  You don't care about dead kids.
[01:12:32.753 --> 01:12:35.154]  InfoWars has plenty of ways to make money.
[01:12:35.154 --> 01:12:39.998]  I've got three of them right here on my desk right now without any dead kids.
[01:12:39.998 --> 01:12:41.319]  That's not Alex Jones.
[01:12:41.319 --> 01:12:41.919]  That's them.
[01:12:42.119 --> 01:12:42.339]  I think?
[01:13:01.846 --> 01:13:03.228]  We need to get distributed.
[01:13:03.228 --> 01:13:04.470]  The blockchain is great.
[01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:11.920]  We need to start, you know, if we're not going to be totally active on these new social media networks, maybe we just form a presence on there and pop in every so often.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.761]  Be distributed.
[01:13:12.761 --> 01:13:14.623]  Don't make it so they can shut you down in one place.
[01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.506]  And then the other thing is conservatives.
[01:13:16.766 --> 01:13:17.006]  I think?
[01:13:34.833 --> 01:13:38.094]  And you see, all of this is just fear of the leftist mob.
[01:13:38.094 --> 01:13:48.317]  They're afraid that the Huffington Post is going to go and contact all of their advertisers and say, don't buy any more ads on Roku because they support Alex Jones, which means they think kids should die.
[01:13:48.317 --> 01:13:51.838]  So the bottom line is, they're a bunch of bullies and we've got to call their bluff.
[01:13:51.838 --> 01:13:53.078]  And that's what I should have said up front.
[01:13:53.078 --> 01:13:54.719]  Yes, this is bullying.
[01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:55.959]  They accuse us of being bullies.
[01:13:55.959 --> 01:13:58.500]  No, they are the bullies and they are running rampant.
[01:13:59.403 --> 01:14:02.546]  And the people defending against the bully, that's not another bully.
[01:14:02.546 --> 01:14:03.487]  That's a hero.
[01:14:03.487 --> 01:14:06.889]  That is the hero who comes in to protect the weak children.
[01:14:06.889 --> 01:14:10.413]  So, when we defend ourselves, when we say, well, you know what?
[01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:12.154]  I'm not going to buy Roku.
[01:14:12.154 --> 01:14:13.735]  I'm not going to use Roku.
[01:14:13.735 --> 01:14:14.996]  It's gone.
[01:14:14.996 --> 01:14:17.739]  Because of that, that makes a big difference.
[01:14:17.739 --> 01:14:18.680]  I think it does, at least.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.981]  Because that's all the fear is here.
[01:14:19.981 --> 01:14:21.642]  It's all money to Roku.
[01:14:21.642 --> 01:14:24.925]  I think this is the first example where this hasn't been ideology.
[01:14:24.925 --> 01:14:27.047]  Obviously, Tim Cook at Apple hates your guts.
[01:14:27.607 --> 01:14:29.468]  Jack Dorsey at Twitter hates your guts.
[01:14:29.468 --> 01:14:31.750]  Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook hates your guts.
[01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:42.456]  But I think this is the first time where a company wanted to do the right thing, and they were so terrified, literally shaking in their boots, that they just said, OK, OK, OK, OK, leftist, we'll do whatever you want.
[01:14:42.456 --> 01:14:43.236]  Get rid of Alex Jones?
[01:14:43.236 --> 01:14:43.436]  Sure.
[01:14:43.436 --> 01:14:44.077]  OK, OK.
[01:14:44.077 --> 01:14:45.918]  Yep, keep the Young Turks on the platform.
[01:14:45.918 --> 01:14:46.338]  You got it.
[01:14:46.338 --> 01:14:46.958]  Anything you want.
[01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:48.539]  Just don't go after our advertisers, please.
[01:14:48.539 --> 01:14:49.560]  We need the money.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.202]  And we need to show them that conservatives, we're the ones who really have this money.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:15:01.484]  You know, and just at an instinctive cellular level, I don't like boycotts and I don't like throwing weight around, but they started it and I agree.
[01:15:01.484 --> 01:15:05.846]  I haven't gotten my Gillette razors out yet and thrown them in the trash and made a stunt out of it.
[01:15:05.846 --> 01:15:07.647]  I'm going to do that today.
[01:15:07.647 --> 01:15:09.468]  I have Roku in my house.
[01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:12.970]  I also have a cloud TV on a computer here at the office.
[01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:17.093]  I'm going to pull it out and I'm going to smash it and I'm going to encourage everybody
[01:15:17.893 --> 01:15:37.450]  to call them and email them and let them know it is out of our house and also all these big left the NFL they're down 30 plus percent with all their anti-american crap good let it all die you're right we work we have the power we're the adults we're not the mental patient globalist and we're done and that's that's what I feel
[01:15:38.531 --> 01:15:41.994]  And it got level last night, this morning, and all of a sudden I feel really good.
[01:15:41.994 --> 01:15:44.236]  I've never felt this good.
[01:15:44.236 --> 01:15:49.119]  And it's an instinctive and spiritual understanding, but also political, Tom, that we're going to win.
[01:15:49.119 --> 01:15:50.240]  And they've gone way too far.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:53.443]  We'll be back with Tom Paffert of God, Emperor, Trump.
[01:15:53.443 --> 01:15:54.063]  Stay with us.

[01:17:27.157 --> 01:17:28.398]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.398 --> 01:17:32.321]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.321 --> 01:17:33.862]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:36.804]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.804 --> 01:17:42.368]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.368 --> 01:17:43.569]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.569 --> 01:17:46.512]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.512 --> 01:17:48.733]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:01.606]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:01.606 --> 01:18:03.127]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:18:03.127 --> 01:18:05.168]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:05.168 --> 01:18:10.072]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:10.072 --> 01:18:13.895]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:13.895 --> 01:18:21.941]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:22.862 --> 01:18:25.663]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:18:25.663 --> 01:18:32.926]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:18:32.926 --> 01:18:36.888]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:18:36.888 --> 01:18:42.831]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:18:42.831 --> 01:18:47.353]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:18:47.353 --> 01:18:50.394]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:07.514]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.514 --> 01:19:10.376]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.376 --> 01:19:16.420]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:23.343]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.343 --> 01:19:29.627]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.627 --> 01:19:36.570]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:37.711 --> 01:19:50.737]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:19:50.737 --> 01:19:54.999]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:19:54.999 --> 01:20:01.262]  X3, now available at mflive.com.
[01:20:01.262 --> 01:20:03.903]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.389 --> 01:20:24.273]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:20:24.273 --> 01:20:25.734]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:46.607 --> 01:20:48.489]  If you just joined us, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:48.489 --> 01:20:49.890]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:53.473]  We have talk show host, TV station manager, Tom Papert.
[01:20:53.473 --> 01:21:00.319]  He's on Facebook at GodEmperorTrumpOfficial, and on Twitter, RealGETrump.
[01:21:00.319 --> 01:21:11.148]  And he's a smart cookie, and we're looking at all the perspectives of Roku in less than six, seven hours after a total hysteria launched by the organized fascist left.
[01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:19.717]  Having me taken off of Roku, where we had an app or a page for almost seven years.
[01:21:19.717 --> 01:21:23.261]  Over a million people just on our old Roku system we made.
[01:21:23.261 --> 01:21:24.242]  We're watching it every week.
[01:21:24.242 --> 01:21:25.864]  We had those statistics from them.
[01:21:25.864 --> 01:21:30.249]  And then some fans, and the gentleman's joining us next segment, built it.
[01:21:30.729 --> 01:21:34.232]  Started out on Veterans Day last year because they were worried about what they saw happening.
[01:21:34.232 --> 01:21:35.613]  Built a first-class app.
[01:21:35.613 --> 01:21:44.199]  It shot to the front page because the algorithm showed that it was going towards the top and we've had other apps go to number one in news like Apple and then they banned that.
[01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:45.921]  We're still on Google Play for now.
[01:21:45.921 --> 01:21:57.550]  It's really important to go there to InfoWars.com forward slash show or InfoWars.com forward slash app and get those because for now when they took our app off Apple they
[01:21:59.577 --> 01:22:01.599]  It's still there if you got it via Apple.
[01:22:01.599 --> 01:22:06.122]  And it'll be the same thing if they do that via Google Play, which we know is getting targeted by the globalists as well.
[01:22:06.122 --> 01:22:07.943]  They are lobbying heavily to have that taken.
[01:22:07.943 --> 01:22:11.866]  But if you have it on your phone or on your computer, then you at least still have it.
[01:22:11.866 --> 01:22:13.347]  So, infowares.com forward slash show.
[01:22:13.347 --> 01:22:14.788]  And I know a lot of you already have it.
[01:22:14.788 --> 01:22:17.810]  Tell others, hey, find out what's so verboten.
[01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:20.832]  Go get this information for yourself.
[01:22:20.832 --> 01:22:22.654]  This is incredibly important.
[01:22:22.654 --> 01:22:22.914]  And again,
[01:22:23.214 --> 01:22:25.836]  I know I lobby and push the listeners to help us and spread the word.
[01:22:25.836 --> 01:22:27.397]  You're the real power of this operation.
[01:22:27.397 --> 01:22:28.618]  Without you, it's over.
[01:22:28.618 --> 01:22:30.860]  But they are working around the clock to take us off the air.
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:36.085]  And the reason I was getting Tom on, we've got to get him on more often, is he crystallized it all right up front.
[01:22:36.085 --> 01:22:43.491]  The whole theme of this broadcast should have been from the beginning, not just how they're saying things in my name I didn't say.
[01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:46.753]  They're the ones actually saying the stuff they say is hurtful and horrible.
[01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:50.576]  That's big, but not as big as these bullies are out of control.
[01:22:51.567 --> 01:22:56.514]  They're running around in organized brigades trying to silence everyone.
[01:22:56.514 --> 01:23:03.043]  They're clear and present authoritarians and conservatives need to boycott Gillette saying men having hair is evil.
[01:23:04.073 --> 01:23:05.674]  But that men are bad, literally.
[01:23:05.674 --> 01:23:13.801]  We need to boycott all of these people, the NFL, the NBA, all these anti-American groups, ladies and gentlemen, and let them know.
[01:23:13.801 --> 01:23:17.004]  Not just give them a political bloody nose, but politically end them.
[01:23:17.004 --> 01:23:18.345]  They're trying to end us.
[01:23:18.345 --> 01:23:19.426]  They started the fight.
[01:23:19.426 --> 01:23:23.669]  Withdraw your money from these stinking bastards now.
[01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:24.070]  Roku.
[01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:26.451]  Absolute crap.
[01:23:26.451 --> 01:23:27.671]  Everyone needs to remove it.
[01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:49.739]  But any of these big outfits, let me tell you, if you want to kill the cable companies and the pedophile obsessed things out there, like the whole situation with Netflix, you must get the digital antennas, hundreds of channels in big cities, dozens and dozens in small towns, sub channels.
[01:23:49.739 --> 01:23:53.280]  When I moved once and didn't have cable and stuff hooked up, I went and bought
[01:23:54.298 --> 01:24:00.008]  I'm not just saying this because Tom manages a TV station, which is what I happen to be on, in, what was it, Kansas.
[01:24:01.033 --> 01:24:24.968]  It's that this is so critical that, this was like three years ago, I was like, my God, there's hundreds of channels in Austin, all the old reruns, nine channels of PBS, all the old front lines, all the old documentaries, all the old World War II movies, all the old John Wayne movies, all the Clint Eastwood movies, Bonanza, Rawhide, hilarious Mexican TV, 20 channels of that.
[01:24:24.968 --> 01:24:28.591]  I mean, just, I'm watching the Mexican film stars, how could you quit looking?
[01:24:29.071 --> 01:24:31.396]  The female star is the best looking woman out there.
[01:24:31.396 --> 01:24:36.688]  And you're sitting there looking at all of this and it's just completely insane.
[01:24:36.688 --> 01:24:38.071]  And meanwhile, it's free.
[01:24:38.945 --> 01:24:53.432]  It's free, and that's the revolution I've wanted to get on local, low-powered TV stations, digital channels, big stations, you name it, which we've gotten on a lot of them, is that people can learn that that's how they do it and pay ZERO to the dirtbag Hollywood scum!
[01:24:53.432 --> 01:25:00.575]  I want to destroy Netflix and all these outfits, ladies and gentlemen, and you do it by getting shows like this on local TV.
[01:25:00.575 --> 01:25:04.537]  I know, Tom, you've got to get back to work, and I've been running over you, I'm so hyped up today, I apologize.
[01:25:04.537 --> 01:25:05.738]  Tom, continue on with us.
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.762]  Alex, I'm happy to stay as long as you want me.
[01:25:08.762 --> 01:25:09.903]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[01:25:09.903 --> 01:25:13.005]  I want to say one thing about local low-power TV.
[01:25:13.005 --> 01:25:14.586]  Like you said, all you need is an antenna.
[01:25:14.586 --> 01:25:19.809]  The average little tiny city, I live in Wichita, Kansas, like 300,000 people living here, that's all.
[01:25:19.809 --> 01:25:21.931]  We have 80 channels you can get with an antenna.
[01:25:21.931 --> 01:25:23.372]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:25:23.372 --> 01:25:28.915]  And one of them, of course, is InfoWars TV, a 24-7 live TV network.
[01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:31.998]  Starts with David Knight in the morning, you in the midday.
[01:25:31.998 --> 01:25:35.320]  Owen Schroer, it's of course got the weekend programming as well with Mike Adams.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.765]  And it is possibly the most watched TV channel in the city at this point.
[01:25:40.765 --> 01:25:47.072]  I say that without a modicum of irony in me because people are finding out about it.
[01:25:47.072 --> 01:25:54.399]  They're finding out that nobody's going to take it down unless there's some kind of grassroots campaign to boycott the TV station and then they get scared.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.103]  We have something called the FCC that's going to protect you here.
[01:25:59.103 --> 01:26:03.887]  There's nobody like Tim Cook who's going to say, all right, no more Alex on this TV channel.
[01:26:03.887 --> 01:26:04.827]  Doesn't work that way.
[01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:12.153]  The government comes in, the government actually does its job and protects the freedom of speech on the public airwaves, which I think is why it's so crucial.
[01:26:12.153 --> 01:26:20.579]  Because just today, this morning, we wake up and we see now there's another article saying that you need to be banned from Facebook again.
[01:26:20.579 --> 01:26:22.701]  Nobody even knew you had anything left on Facebook.
[01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:24.262]  I know you've got the News Wars page.
[01:26:24.842 --> 01:26:31.767]  Paul Joseph Watson has some pages on there and then of course there's a fan-made one that they attribute to you.
[01:26:31.767 --> 01:26:33.168]  Those are fan pages too.
[01:26:33.168 --> 01:26:47.459]  I mean sometimes I guess that the social network guys send people links and things out on the list but yes they're hunting it down like if I even have a voice or if I even have a chance to respond on Facebook to lies that they're saying about me I've got to be taken down.
[01:26:48.297 --> 01:26:48.517]  Right.
[01:26:48.517 --> 01:26:54.258]  The next step is going to be ban anybody who talks about Alex Jones, which I think is already happening in the algorithm.
[01:26:54.258 --> 01:27:00.560]  Anytime we write an article about you, Alex, if we put your face in it, the reach goes very far lower than what we expected.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.760]  It's a viral-looking article.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.441]  It's got Alex Jones in the headline.
[01:27:03.441 --> 01:27:05.701]  It should be everybody's favorite article of the day.
[01:27:05.701 --> 01:27:11.623]  I honestly believe if your face is in it, if your full name, Alex Jones, is in it, they're going to do what they can to take it back.
[01:27:11.623 --> 01:27:12.803]  So that's the next step.
[01:27:12.803 --> 01:27:17.764]  Anybody who even talks about Alex Jones, you're going to get a Snopes.com article underneath their comment saying,
[01:27:17.984 --> 01:27:19.889]  Did you know this comment is fake news?
[01:27:19.889 --> 01:27:21.452]  Alex Jones hates kids!
[01:27:21.452 --> 01:27:22.976]  That's where we're heading with all this stuff.
[01:27:22.976 --> 01:27:25.561]  We have to ban anybody who even wants to defend you.
[01:27:26.619 --> 01:27:29.742]  And I think, again, the solution is to get away from these people.
[01:27:29.742 --> 01:27:31.864]  Maybe we just don't spend so much time on Facebook.
[01:27:31.864 --> 01:27:39.210]  Maybe instead of watching it on a Roku device, we get an antenna and watch you on Channel 5.4 in Wichita, Kansas.
[01:27:39.210 --> 01:27:41.992]  There are lots of other ways we can fight these people economically.
[01:27:41.992 --> 01:27:45.695]  And the next thing I think we need to do is say, well, who's advertising on Roku?
[01:27:45.695 --> 01:27:47.497]  Who are they worried about losing?
[01:27:47.497 --> 01:27:51.180]  Well, maybe some of those people are companies that have conservative leanings.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:58.522]  Maybe we need to start contacting them and say, hey, did you know that you're spending money with a company that is firmly anti-First Amendment?
[01:27:58.522 --> 01:28:00.083]  Can you defend that for me, please?
[01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:03.964]  Can you defend why your company supports demolishing the First Amendment?
[01:28:03.964 --> 01:28:08.446]  I don't know how these people will answer, and I think if enough conservatives demand an answer, they're going to be in trouble.
[01:28:10.219 --> 01:28:19.181]  Tom Peppert, you're absolutely right, and there's something really sexy about the government and Tim Cook and the media not knowing what you're watching and listening to.
[01:28:19.181 --> 01:28:35.245]  Sure, it's fun to click it and pause it and have it when you want it with all this digital stuff, but there's something so much fun about the antenna hooked into the TV, and then it's like, whatever's on, you go around looking, and it's like, it's more fun, and it's just, and I'm telling you, that's the answer
[01:28:35.905 --> 01:28:50.398]  To the point, folks, I think I'm going to buy digital TV antennas en masse and just sell them at cost to listeners at InfoWareStore.com to just really hype that revolution of getting back to where you see the information, it doesn't see you.
[01:28:50.398 --> 01:28:51.539]  Ever think of that?
[01:28:51.539 --> 01:28:53.400]  You watch TV, it doesn't watch you.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.481]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:54.481 --> 01:28:54.842]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.205 --> 01:29:00.147]  At WolfHillAmmo.com, we love shotguns.

[01:31:07.744 --> 01:31:11.146]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[01:31:11.146 --> 01:31:17.789]  They just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.

[01:31:29.336 --> 01:31:32.298]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:31:32.298 --> 01:31:33.419]  I want to keep going.
[01:31:33.419 --> 01:31:37.242]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:39.264]  I want to push all the way.
[01:31:39.264 --> 01:31:40.545]  I've committed to do that.
[01:31:40.545 --> 01:31:41.626]  I've prayed for that.

[01:33:29.898 --> 01:33:33.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:43.527]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.527 --> 01:33:50.011]  Suspicion is your name.
[01:33:50.011 --> 01:33:51.612]  Your honesty you blame.
[01:33:51.612 --> 01:33:53.814]  With dignity you say dishonor.
[01:33:56.963 --> 01:33:58.764]  All right, we have got a full house here.
[01:33:58.764 --> 01:34:01.545]  We have Tom Papert riding shotgun with us.
[01:34:01.545 --> 01:34:09.870]  He is the manager at one of the great TV stations we're on that is one of the highest rated, if not the most watched channel in Wichita, that we're on 24 hours a day.
[01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:13.392]  InfoWars TV that was on Roku, now off.
[01:34:13.392 --> 01:34:20.175]  And then we've also got John of OTP, InfoWars Roku app developer, who were listeners.
[01:34:20.175 --> 01:34:21.376]  They contacted Zimmerman.
[01:34:22.176 --> 01:34:25.899]  The memory serves a few months ago and said, hey, these developers are really good developers.
[01:34:25.899 --> 01:34:27.380]  They want to build this for free.
[01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:28.381]  Can they have the authorization?
[01:34:28.381 --> 01:34:29.842]  I said, absolutely.
[01:34:29.842 --> 01:34:44.213]  And it went to the front page the first day, and then it got banned by the left because they said that I was sending people live time, continuing to do horrible things and send people to the houses of Sandy Hook children, which I never did, period.
[01:34:44.213 --> 01:34:45.274]  So it's simply insane.
[01:34:46.161 --> 01:34:51.065]  Now, we also are going to have our sound guy, we'll just go by Connor.
[01:34:51.065 --> 01:34:56.950]  So I've told the crew, anytime they want to pop in on air and make these great points during the breaks, please do it.
[01:34:56.950 --> 01:35:01.214]  And he was talking about a book he read about television and the history of it, which is totally true.
[01:35:01.214 --> 01:35:04.897]  And if you understand this, it is super deep.
[01:35:04.897 --> 01:35:11.483]  And then you understand the entire enchilada of how at first, why was TV so wholesome, so good, so avant-garde?
[01:35:12.421 --> 01:35:16.124]  Because it was reflecting the world it already saw.
[01:35:16.124 --> 01:35:17.745]  Make TV like it was.
[01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:20.106]  And that's how it was, folks.
[01:35:20.106 --> 01:35:21.107]  Especially in America.
[01:35:21.107 --> 01:35:25.110]  The globalists were threatened by the superior civilization.
[01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:26.691]  That's where everybody wanted to get into America.
[01:35:26.691 --> 01:35:33.555]  It was pretty much like, in most areas, what you saw on Leave it to Beaver, or what you saw on Gunsmoke.
[01:35:33.555 --> 01:35:34.196]  Okay?
[01:35:34.196 --> 01:35:36.958]  And so, John Wayne was just a regular dude.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:41.862]  The guys in the military were the real John Waynes, okay?
[01:35:41.862 --> 01:35:44.704]  So, corrupt people were threatened by it.
[01:35:44.704 --> 01:35:48.007]  So they learned to use TV to make the world however they wanted.
[01:35:48.007 --> 01:35:53.771]  Notice, TV has now turned the world, the sick culture of Hollywood is turning the whole world into Hollywood.
[01:35:53.771 --> 01:35:57.874]  So I've kind of made the point, but get into the book and the specifics, because you're making some great points, Connor.
[01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:05.153]  Hey Alex, so essentially what the book is called is, trust me I'm lying, Confessions of a Media Manipulator.
[01:36:05.153 --> 01:36:13.436]  So what he talks about in this book, you kind of just touched on, the concept of how TV became this reflection of society.
[01:36:13.436 --> 01:36:20.379]  So when TV was this new medium that was being made, it was essentially, it was fluid.
[01:36:20.379 --> 01:36:24.040]  They didn't really know what to do with it when they first started making it.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:27.562]  And they kind of had to just come up with ideas as to like,
[01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:32.165]  Create something that is a reflection of reality in society.
[01:36:32.165 --> 01:36:42.673]  And as they kind of started to polish this out over time, they eventually started to kind of figure out how to fine-tune television as an accurate reflection of society.
[01:36:42.673 --> 01:36:55.083]  But over time, as society became more and more dependent on television, and started to become more engaged with it, and it became the predominant medium in society as the go-to place for entertainment information,
[01:36:55.763 --> 01:36:59.425]  Over time, society started to reflect what television was.
[01:36:59.425 --> 01:37:13.574]  And so, now when you look into, kind of flash forward to the modern day where we're at now, now he takes the internet as a very similar analogy as to when the internet was first created, it was kind of just this mess of information.
[01:37:13.574 --> 01:37:17.337]  You know, like websites, you didn't know how to find them, information was everywhere.
[01:37:17.557 --> 01:37:20.418]  There was no real linear organization to it all.
[01:37:20.418 --> 01:37:21.218]  It was chaotic.
[01:37:21.218 --> 01:37:22.138]  It was erratic.
[01:37:22.138 --> 01:37:35.921]  But now, where things are kind of becoming more streamlined, more funneled down, we kind of have a more logical way of using the internet, well now it seems as though we, as a people, are becoming a reflection of the internet.
[01:37:35.921 --> 01:37:42.183]  This erratic, short-tempered, just like very, just
[01:37:43.945 --> 01:37:44.886]  Are you sure?
[01:38:04.599 --> 01:38:06.640]  Well, Connor, you're always saying really smart stuff.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.181]  So is Zach, so is everybody back there.
[01:38:08.181 --> 01:38:14.826]  So anytime you guys are trying to tell me a great point, I always say, take the real world and put it out there.
[01:38:14.826 --> 01:38:23.732]  These great discussions, the great energy we burn, I mean, it's a great, we ought to put live cameras out there sometime and just have a reality TV show of what's happening out there.
[01:38:24.272 --> 01:38:28.075]  Because that's where you get to see everything, the research, what we're doing.
[01:38:28.075 --> 01:38:30.076]  But imagine to the fakes in the corporate media.
[01:38:30.076 --> 01:38:36.080]  They think we sit around in boardrooms and go, let's say Sandy Hook didn't happen and hurt people's feelings.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:39.422]  We'll make lots of money off of that.
[01:38:39.422 --> 01:38:41.403]  No, we lost money doing it.
[01:38:41.403 --> 01:38:43.925]  Just like saying 9-11's an inside job investigated.
[01:38:43.925 --> 01:38:45.726]  It didn't mean radical Islam wasn't real.
[01:38:45.726 --> 01:38:48.148]  It meant there were stand downs and that's now been proven.
[01:38:48.148 --> 01:38:50.770]  I lost almost all my radio stations.
[01:38:50.770 --> 01:38:52.651]  70 plus beautiful radio stations.
[01:38:52.651 --> 01:38:53.692]  A lot of them huge.
[01:38:54.712 --> 01:38:57.935]  I mean, I lost millions because I told the truth!
[01:38:57.935 --> 01:39:02.978]  But they want to steal my identity and say, I'm going to say this.
[01:39:02.978 --> 01:39:03.939]  It's incredible.
[01:39:03.939 --> 01:39:05.820]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:06.380]  But it shows.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:07.741]  I think the bottom has dropped out.
[01:39:07.741 --> 01:39:13.225]  And because of the radicalness on TV, all the murder, all the death, all of it, it's also blurred reality with fantasy.
[01:39:13.225 --> 01:39:19.929]  And people are just conditioned now to not value the basic underpinning of what built this society.
[01:39:19.929 --> 01:39:21.550]  Tom, we're going to go to John here.
[01:39:22.951 --> 01:39:25.194]  Tell us about John, because you know John as well.
[01:39:25.194 --> 01:39:27.416]  It's this great community out there, and what he did.
[01:39:27.416 --> 01:39:29.198]  And then we'll go to John.
[01:39:29.198 --> 01:39:34.002]  Well, it does just fascinate me how every patriot, it seems like if you're doing this long enough, you meet each other.
[01:39:34.002 --> 01:39:36.585]  So I've known John on Facebook for a couple years now.
[01:39:36.585 --> 01:39:46.435]  I've known that he is a real whiz when it comes to programming, is a software engineer by trade, working at kind of a high-profile place, which I think is why he doesn't want it to get out.
[01:39:47.015 --> 01:39:53.699]  Um, and he just kind of said a few months ago on Veterans Day weekend, in fact, I think I want to make an InfoWars app for Roku.
[01:39:53.699 --> 01:39:54.860]  I think that would be fun.
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:56.681]  I could lay in bed and watch InfoWars.
[01:39:56.681 --> 01:39:57.202]  It'll be cool.
[01:39:57.202 --> 01:39:59.143]  It'll be perfect HD.
[01:39:59.143 --> 01:40:04.326]  People without good TV reception won't have to worry about getting a high-power antenna, putting it on a 20-foot pole.
[01:40:04.326 --> 01:40:05.127]  I'm gonna do this.
[01:40:05.587 --> 01:40:10.450]  So he sat down, he started figuring out, you know, how he was going to do it, what the approval process looked like.
[01:40:10.450 --> 01:40:17.655]  He discovered, of course, that Roku already had an InfoWars app, which he took as an indication that the platform valued freedom of speech.
[01:40:17.655 --> 01:40:19.416]  And he got his wife to make some graphics.
[01:40:19.416 --> 01:40:20.416]  It looked really slick.
[01:40:20.416 --> 01:40:25.079]  You've been shown some of the screenshots I know that we posted to BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[01:40:25.079 --> 01:40:28.201]  And it took them about two and a half, three months, they got it done.
[01:40:28.201 --> 01:40:29.802]  It worked fantastically.
[01:40:29.802 --> 01:40:34.045]  Roku actually tested the app, watched you live, so they knew what it was.
[01:40:34.785 --> 01:40:42.690]  And everything looked to be great, of course, until yesterday about, what, 10 o'clock in the morning when the left-wing outrage machine started.
[01:40:42.690 --> 01:40:50.974]  So I kind of feel bad for John because he was just trying to do a good thing and now I know he feels kind of like he's hurt in FOWARS because he got your other one banned.
[01:40:50.974 --> 01:40:53.015]  But I know he's just a brilliant patriot.
[01:40:53.015 --> 01:40:53.976]  He was trying to do his best.
[01:40:53.976 --> 01:40:54.776]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:40:54.776 --> 01:40:56.897]  And so the app was born on January 14th.
[01:40:58.418 --> 01:41:10.749]  2019, it died on January 15th, killed by leftist outrage mobs run by CNN, the Washington Post, and PR operatives of the Democratic Party just out there engaged in total disinformation.
[01:41:10.749 --> 01:41:11.870]  But we salute John.
[01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:12.230]  No, no, no.
[01:41:12.230 --> 01:41:13.071]  I mean, he got in the ring.
[01:41:13.071 --> 01:41:14.312]  He did a great job.
[01:41:14.312 --> 01:41:16.794]  And something about engineers and software people.
[01:41:16.794 --> 01:41:22.158]  I have a sneaking suspicion that the mother of invention is necessity.
[01:41:22.158 --> 01:41:24.140]  And so I think we're the doers.
[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:25.540]  Thank you Alex for having me on.
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.021]  It's been quite a surreal experience in just a few hours.
[01:41:49.623 --> 01:41:58.251]  After InfoWars got banned off YouTube, I started to realize that there really wasn't a place for anyone to watch InfoWars.
[01:41:58.251 --> 01:42:04.297]  I knew about the Roku app, and I knew you guys launched some new shows last year, and I wanted to make those available.
[01:42:04.297 --> 01:42:06.659]  I enjoyed the War Room and David Knight Show as well.
[01:42:07.299 --> 01:42:07.799]  I think so.
[01:42:23.466 --> 01:42:24.067]  I think so.
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.521]  But it apparently didn't last.
[01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:55.373]  And now the controlled fascist left has gone from denying that they censor to just saying ban everyone in just an arrogant power mad lust with the blood of censorship fresh in their greedy wolf-like mouths.
[01:42:55.373 --> 01:42:55.874]  We'll be back.
[01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:58.790]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:42:58.790 --> 01:43:00.511]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:00.511 --> 01:43:02.031]  Defeat the pedophiles.

[01:45:58.010 --> 01:46:02.114]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:46:02.114 --> 01:46:09.180]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[01:46:21.792 --> 01:46:22.472]  We're good to go!
[01:46:43.343 --> 01:46:45.825]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:21.991 --> 01:47:23.112]  Big Brother.
[01:47:23.112 --> 01:47:24.935]  Mainstream media.
[01:47:24.935 --> 01:47:26.857]  Government cover-ups.
[01:47:26.857 --> 01:47:28.519]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:28.519 --> 01:47:30.182]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:30.182 --> 01:47:34.727]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:37.648 --> 01:47:47.957]  Now we've got a lot of exciting things we're working on right now, like just a little fire stick that you plug in your TV and you get all the info wars, broadcast everything.
[01:47:47.957 --> 01:47:57.845]  This revolution towards everybody being able to have their own stick or their own Roku box and have the price down to where it's basically just the price of shipping is where it's going and that's where we're going.
[01:47:58.605 --> 01:47:59.986]  But I love Cloud TV.
[01:47:59.986 --> 01:48:01.286]  I love One American News.
[01:48:01.286 --> 01:48:06.608]  We're partnering with all these folks to stand up against the censorship, because this country is in a real war.
[01:48:06.608 --> 01:48:07.468]  It's in a real fight.
[01:48:07.468 --> 01:48:12.550]  And so many of the best journalists I know are liberals.
[01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:13.711]  They're not leftists.
[01:48:13.711 --> 01:48:15.371]  Prager University breaks that down.
[01:48:15.371 --> 01:48:18.993]  They're classical liberals, like Thomas Jefferson, like Cassandra Fairbanks.
[01:48:18.993 --> 01:48:20.673]  She's a big liberal.
[01:48:20.673 --> 01:48:22.954]  Anti-war, all this other stuff, like Rand Paul.
[01:48:22.954 --> 01:48:24.155]  But she's not a leftist.
[01:48:24.975 --> 01:48:30.440]  Okay, and now she's fighting hard and being called, you know, a Nazi and stuff by the mainstream media.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:37.666]  And these people are the ones that are involved in the dissension, in the infighting, in the racism, and America is getting sick and tired of it.
[01:48:37.666 --> 01:48:42.591]  You know, this morning, I didn't get too hyper on air for some reason.
[01:48:42.591 --> 01:48:47.795]  It's almost like I like power through it, but in the new studio I've been moving into, it's a lot darker.
[01:48:48.723 --> 01:48:51.245]  For whatever reason, it feels more like a radio studio.
[01:48:51.245 --> 01:48:52.586]  I'm a lot calmer in there.
[01:48:52.586 --> 01:48:54.128]  You've been seeing some of the reports.
[01:48:54.128 --> 01:48:57.991]  I shot about a 16-minute report this morning.
[01:48:57.991 --> 01:49:00.894]  That's my official statement on Roku and on Sandy Hook.
[01:49:00.894 --> 01:49:03.516]  And it's going to be very important, and I need your help, folks.
[01:49:03.516 --> 01:49:06.559]  They will never let my statements get out.
[01:49:06.559 --> 01:49:09.301]  So they can keep lying about what I said and did.
[01:49:09.301 --> 01:49:11.823]  That's why I have to make the Sandy Hook documentary now.
[01:49:11.823 --> 01:49:13.665]  I'm announcing that.
[01:49:13.665 --> 01:49:15.547]  About the event?
[01:49:16.810 --> 01:49:26.817]  And about what came out of it, and about the whole process of being persecuted around it, and the disinformation, and what I really said, versus how they edited it.
[01:49:26.817 --> 01:49:30.399]  And of course the film is going to be my defense.
[01:49:30.399 --> 01:49:36.463]  And so I'm going to make the film, and it will be put out there for everybody, so people know the truth.
[01:49:36.463 --> 01:49:40.366]  But they plan to not just crucify me on this, and make me die on this hill.
[01:49:40.366 --> 01:49:42.387]  They plan to destroy the entire First Amendment.
[01:49:42.387 --> 01:49:45.029]  So we're going to go back to John, and again, I'm not the technical guy.
[01:49:46.207 --> 01:49:53.772]  I saw a Facebook up there that looks like you could still, I guess, get the app that was on Roku, or we'll see how John's gonna fight back.
[01:49:53.772 --> 01:49:55.953]  I wanna explain something.
[01:49:55.953 --> 01:50:08.521]  People call me constantly, or I get emails, and in customer service I hear a man called and he wants to know, you know, he owns 10 concrete trucks.
[01:50:08.521 --> 01:50:10.902]  This actually happened in Cleveland, this was a couple months ago.
[01:50:10.902 --> 01:50:13.704]  He wants to know if he can paint Infowars.com down the side.
[01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:18.284]  And I get respecting somebody and all that, but we're an information operation.
[01:50:18.284 --> 01:50:22.468]  You can tattoo info wars on your wife's rear end if you want to.
[01:50:22.468 --> 01:50:33.377]  My point is, it's a symbol of rebellion against tyranny, a symbol of standing up for the unborn, a symbol of standing up for self-defense, a symbol of standing up for free speech, against bullies, the chi-coms, the globalists, all of them.
[01:50:33.377 --> 01:50:34.218]  Okay?
[01:50:34.218 --> 01:50:36.560]  So like it or not, we become a symbol of this.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.983]  We have to fight, we have to get into it, and actually know it's a blessing.
[01:50:40.862 --> 01:50:42.103]  This is going to backfire on them.
[01:50:42.103 --> 01:50:43.264]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:50:43.264 --> 01:50:44.966]  He already has in many ways.
[01:50:44.966 --> 01:50:48.310]  So people call and say, can I put Infowars on the side of my barn?
[01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:50.432]  Not just yes, but hell yes!
[01:50:50.432 --> 01:50:52.153]  Can I kiss your butt to do it?
[01:50:53.248 --> 01:50:54.849]  Free-to-air, everything.
[01:50:54.849 --> 01:50:55.890]  It's all free-to-air.
[01:50:55.890 --> 01:50:58.392]  You can do anything you want with our stuff.
[01:50:58.392 --> 01:51:10.181]  You don't think the Washington Post and the Young Turds and Megyn Kelly, when they edit my videos about Hillary killing kids in the Middle East, funding ISIS, turns it into killing kids in a pizza place, mixing two clips together.
[01:51:10.181 --> 01:51:14.284]  You don't think she has permission, that evil dumb witch that everybody hates now?
[01:51:15.325 --> 01:51:17.326]  She died on the hill trying to take me down, didn't she?
[01:51:17.326 --> 01:51:18.246]  Politically.
[01:51:18.246 --> 01:51:23.269]  So, we're in a war here, folks, so you don't need my permission for Jack's squat.
[01:51:23.269 --> 01:51:24.409]  In fact, I love GCN.
[01:51:24.409 --> 01:51:25.029]  I love Ted.
[01:51:25.029 --> 01:51:26.690]  But GCN's its own deal.
[01:51:26.690 --> 01:51:29.111]  We run, obviously, a more high-tech operation.
[01:51:29.111 --> 01:51:33.193]  Out of niceness, I still let them carry it, and they get half the commercials.
[01:51:33.193 --> 01:51:34.694]  It's a bad business decision.
[01:51:34.694 --> 01:51:42.337]  The one reason I may leave GCN, and I'll let Ted know this, is I want to just give our radio stations all the ads, so I get more affiliates.
[01:51:42.337 --> 01:51:44.378]  You can just have them all, and I'll do one plug an hour on air.
[01:51:45.359 --> 01:51:51.043]  I mean, I've done a lot of innovating stuff, and I want to do that, but my loyalty is my weakness sometimes.
[01:51:51.043 --> 01:51:53.144]  I love Ted to death, but I don't know.
[01:51:53.144 --> 01:51:55.366]  I already intended this year to just, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:51:55.366 --> 01:51:57.747]  The point is, air the sucker.
[01:51:57.747 --> 01:52:00.109]  Do whatever you want with it, okay?
[01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:01.230]  I want to get the word out.
[01:52:01.230 --> 01:52:02.871]  I want to get around the censors, period.
[01:52:02.871 --> 01:52:06.493]  Now, we're going to go to our guest here and let him have the floor, because I'm hyperventilating and out of control.
[01:52:06.493 --> 01:52:09.816]  We'll do five more minutes with Tom Papert in the next hour, TV station manager here.
[01:52:11.121 --> 01:52:12.481]  People ask, how are you so excited?
[01:52:12.481 --> 01:52:14.082]  I've had one cup of coffee today.
[01:52:14.082 --> 01:52:16.662]  When this stuff happens, I get energized, man.
[01:52:16.662 --> 01:52:19.603]  They're taking our children's birthright.
[01:52:19.603 --> 01:52:21.383]  They're killing America in front of us.
[01:52:21.383 --> 01:52:26.504]  So if you're a radio listener, I have a hammer in my hand, a small sledgehammer.
[01:52:26.504 --> 01:52:29.165]  I don't know the technical name of this.
[01:52:29.165 --> 01:52:33.966]  A four-lib sledgehammer, four-pound, East Wing.
[01:52:35.373 --> 01:52:41.379]  And I am going to smash the Roku commie stick.
[01:52:41.379 --> 01:52:43.301]  I'm not saying take away their free speech.
[01:52:43.301 --> 01:52:44.522]  I'm not saying I'm going to shut them down.
[01:52:44.522 --> 01:52:46.544]  I wish no harm against them.
[01:52:46.544 --> 01:52:49.647]  I'm saying that you're smashing my free speech.
[01:52:49.647 --> 01:52:51.028]  You're out of my life.
[01:52:51.028 --> 01:52:57.594]  And everyone I know that knows you is going to have you out of their lives, Roku.
[01:52:57.594 --> 01:53:00.317]  So, it's fitting that you be destroyed.
[01:53:02.043 --> 01:53:08.530]  On top of a Roger Stone book so I don't smash the table, The Clinton War on Women, available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:53:08.530 --> 01:53:09.611]  Show!
[01:53:09.611 --> 01:53:13.215]  Bye-bye to Roku, hello to cloud.
[01:53:13.215 --> 01:53:13.776]  Oh!
[01:53:13.776 --> 01:53:14.937]  That didn't feel too good.
[01:53:14.937 --> 01:53:17.460]  Can we bring it back up here one more time, please?
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.061]  May I have an assistant here?
[01:53:19.061 --> 01:53:22.305]  Again, I'm not trying to break the table here, so I'm being...
[01:53:24.306 --> 01:53:26.167]  I'm being very, very judicious.
[01:53:26.167 --> 01:53:26.707]  No, it's fine.
[01:53:26.707 --> 01:53:28.427]  Can I just have the stick?
[01:53:28.427 --> 01:53:29.108]  Thank you.
[01:53:29.108 --> 01:53:30.408]  I need to finish killing it.
[01:53:30.408 --> 01:53:31.769]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:31.769 --> 01:53:36.490]  All right, I'm being judicious here, but I need to go ahead and act a little bit more manly and take this sucker out.
[01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:41.132]  Close shot, please, for the money shot.
[01:53:41.132 --> 01:53:42.212]  All right.
[01:53:42.212 --> 01:53:43.653]  And now let's get the box.
[01:53:43.653 --> 01:53:44.593]  Sorry, that fell off again.
[01:53:44.593 --> 01:53:46.534]  Will somebody bring me the box, please?
[01:53:46.534 --> 01:53:50.235]  And then this time we'll smash it on Jeb and the Bush crime family.
[01:53:51.303 --> 01:53:53.705]  Yes, we will take care of that for everyone right now.
[01:53:53.705 --> 01:53:57.587]  Thank you very much, Daria.
[01:53:57.587 --> 01:53:59.068]  There you go.
[01:53:59.068 --> 01:53:59.989]  Maybe we should have her do it.
[01:53:59.989 --> 01:54:00.689]  She's tougher than I am.
[01:54:00.689 --> 01:54:02.751]  Here we go.
[01:54:02.751 --> 01:54:03.311]  There we go.
[01:54:03.311 --> 01:54:05.672]  Let's see how I like that.
[01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:06.753]  I'm really not trying.
[01:54:06.753 --> 01:54:08.735]  Tough little bugger.
[01:54:08.735 --> 01:54:10.135]  Sound like America.
[01:54:10.135 --> 01:54:14.738]  I wish Roku would have joined America, but it just can't seem to do it.
[01:54:14.738 --> 01:54:16.360]  That little sucker's tough to take out.
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:19.922]  I should be wearing safety glasses here and being more politically correct, because I'm not really even hitting it hard.
[01:54:21.115 --> 01:54:23.596]  So, come here, I'll get you now.
[01:54:23.596 --> 01:54:24.656]  Okay, I'm getting mad now.
[01:54:24.656 --> 01:54:25.936]  I'm gonna get this guy.
[01:54:25.936 --> 01:54:27.216]  This sucker's tough.
[01:54:27.216 --> 01:54:28.477]  Roku, you will pay!
[01:54:28.477 --> 01:54:32.377]  I tell you, it's harder than a jar of pickles.
[01:54:32.377 --> 01:54:34.558]  Do what?
[01:54:34.558 --> 01:54:35.758]  I'm gonna use the backside of the hammer.
[01:54:35.758 --> 01:54:38.979]  Well, it is a little compound little sucker, I tell you.
[01:54:38.979 --> 01:54:44.140]  Roku's almost as tough as the First Amendment, but, you know, they killed it, so maybe we can deal with them.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:47.201]  There you go, right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:47.201 --> 01:54:48.221]  Say bye-bye!
[01:54:49.895 --> 01:54:50.635]  That's a better idea.
[01:54:50.635 --> 01:54:51.116]  That got it.
[01:54:51.116 --> 01:54:53.577]  Okay, now it's been destroyed.
[01:54:53.577 --> 01:54:57.580]  And that's just a primitive chimpanzee behavior, but it was fun to do.
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:58.560]  I'm gonna stop ranting now.
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:00.202]  I apologize making you hold John.
[01:55:00.202 --> 01:55:02.323]  John, how are you gonna fight back against this?
[01:55:02.323 --> 01:55:05.405]  Is there a way to find the app that was known as the Roku app?
[01:55:06.775 --> 01:55:08.096]  Yes, actually.
[01:55:08.096 --> 01:55:12.699]  So there is a long process to get approved to be in the App Store.
[01:55:12.699 --> 01:55:18.043]  But from the beginning, there is always an option to have a non-certified Roku channel.
[01:55:18.043 --> 01:55:21.686]  And I was sharing that with friends in a beta test, you know.
[01:55:22.687 --> 01:55:24.449]  Actually, I've put up a link.
[01:55:24.449 --> 01:55:28.253]  It's also on the Facebook page with the Use App button.
[01:55:28.253 --> 01:55:34.140]  That link will take you to your MyRoku account, and once you log in, you can add it.
[01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:42.409]  But you will also receive a message saying that the content may be offensive or inappropriate for some audiences, and that Roku doesn't condone it.
[01:55:43.937 --> 01:55:46.618]  I mean, to be clear, they never condoned the content to begin with.
[01:55:46.618 --> 01:55:50.920]  They were very clear at the beginning to protect free speech.
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:56:03.324]  But it seemed like somebody, I mean, the media was one thing to have such a slew of articles, you know, trying to slander Roku over doing this and them defending themselves.
[01:56:03.784 --> 01:56:09.647]  Oh, the Washington Post says, you know, when we learned that Jones was sending people live time to their houses via the app, we had to stop him, which wasn't true.
[01:56:09.647 --> 01:56:11.227]  It's totally made up.
[01:56:11.227 --> 01:56:11.688]  It's like,
[01:56:26.494 --> 01:56:31.958]  I was using it as a communication device to launch Sherman tanks, you know, and Blitzkrieg armies.
[01:56:31.958 --> 01:56:38.181]  And so, none of that's true, but that's how they got the immediacy of getting around the First Amendment of, he's sending people to the hell to stop him!
[01:56:38.181 --> 01:56:38.742]  Which I didn't do.
[01:56:41.039 --> 01:56:42.380]  Exactly.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:47.143]  And so I want to fight back on Roku, and maybe we can try to push them.
[01:56:47.143 --> 01:56:50.965]  I would encourage everybody to send emails to Roku.
[01:56:50.965 --> 01:57:00.751]  I think what they had trending was boycott Roku on Twitter yesterday, and I think we can easily take back that hashtag and push back on our side.
[01:57:00.751 --> 01:57:02.732]  Clearly Roku was afraid of that initially.
[01:57:02.892 --> 01:57:04.313]  Well, I'll tell you what's going to have to happen.
[01:57:04.313 --> 01:57:09.258]  You know, you don't just think the lawyers are in the news saying, I'm actively sending people to the houses to harass kids.
[01:57:09.258 --> 01:57:11.401]  Never happened, certainly not happening now.
[01:57:11.401 --> 01:57:15.164]  You know then, we've gotten the word, they're also threatening to sue people, or implying it.
[01:57:15.164 --> 01:57:18.168]  So, I've got to file lawsuits, and it's happening.
[01:57:18.168 --> 01:57:20.690]  Don't worry, it's 100% on.
[01:57:20.690 --> 01:57:23.573]  I've got to file a bunch of lawsuits now, just to get my name back.
[01:57:23.573 --> 01:57:25.375]  Because this crap of them running around saying,
[01:57:25.615 --> 01:57:27.996]  Jones is actively sending people to houses right now.
[01:57:27.996 --> 01:57:28.436]  Help us!
[01:57:28.436 --> 01:57:29.277]  Oh God, he's here!
[01:57:29.277 --> 01:57:29.437]  911!
[01:57:29.437 --> 01:57:30.598]  Jones is here!
[01:57:30.598 --> 01:57:31.198]  Roku!
[01:57:31.198 --> 01:57:33.499]  They're using you to attack us!
[01:57:33.499 --> 01:57:36.601]  Help us!
[01:57:36.601 --> 01:57:39.962]  I mean, it's just like, they're trying to create hysteria.
[01:57:39.962 --> 01:57:41.743]  But just wait, just wait.
[01:57:41.743 --> 01:57:43.604]  Once these lawsuits are filed, it'll be a whole other world.
[01:57:43.604 --> 01:57:44.365]  Stay right there.
[01:57:44.365 --> 01:57:45.005]  Come back to you, John.
[01:57:47.290 --> 01:57:55.696]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.696 --> 01:57:57.137]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.137 --> 01:58:01.440]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:04.922]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[01:58:05.402 --> 01:58:07.084]  I still have that energy.
[01:58:07.084 --> 01:58:27.240]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[01:59:51.773 --> 01:59:54.395]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.323 --> 02:00:15.166]  Coming up next segment, we've got the most insane video ever from the Washington Post.
[02:00:15.166 --> 02:00:19.108]  It is the best unintentional comedy in the galaxy.
[02:00:19.108 --> 02:00:21.689]  Why Alex Jones needs to be banned?
[02:00:21.689 --> 02:00:29.393]  He's effective and... These people are sick.
[02:00:29.393 --> 02:00:29.513]  Hey!
[02:00:31.277 --> 02:00:33.158]  We're going back to our amazing guest here to let them finish up.
[02:00:33.158 --> 02:00:37.199]  But if you're watching on TV, I've got the four-pound sledgehammer here.
[02:00:37.199 --> 02:00:41.300]  And I've already smashed the Roku device you can see right there.
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:42.180]  And oops!
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:43.400]  I missed.
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:46.821]  I missed and I hit Hitler with it.
[02:00:46.821 --> 02:00:51.883]  It's a book about Hitler's granddaughter.
[02:00:51.883 --> 02:00:57.944]  And, getting serious, the son of the top Nazi asset in the U.S.
[02:00:57.944 --> 02:00:59.865]  But I wish no harm upon them because they're already in hell.
[02:01:00.808 --> 02:01:02.249]  So, we're done talking about that.
[02:01:02.249 --> 02:01:03.810]  Now, if you're a TV viewer, you saw that.
[02:01:03.810 --> 02:01:05.472]  If you're a radio listener, you didn't.
[02:01:05.472 --> 02:01:07.793]  Gentlemen, I am definitely in hyper mode right now.
[02:01:07.793 --> 02:01:09.815]  I was up at one in the morning working on this.
[02:01:09.815 --> 02:01:11.896]  Tom Papert, on fire with his great work.
[02:01:11.896 --> 02:01:13.117]  How do we find more about you?
[02:01:13.117 --> 02:01:16.660]  John, the app developer, now saying, hey, guess what?
[02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:21.324]  There's still an underground Roku app that hasn't been expunged yet.
[02:01:21.324 --> 02:01:24.006]  So, gentlemen, closing comments.
[02:01:24.006 --> 02:01:26.888]  I definitely want to get you both back on soon with updates.
[02:01:28.055 --> 02:01:31.296]  Well, Alex, I'm just glad I could come on and that I could help get this news out there.
[02:01:31.296 --> 02:01:32.697]  You can find me on Facebook.
[02:01:32.697 --> 02:01:36.899]  I'm GodEmperorTrump on Twitter at RealGETrump.
[02:01:36.899 --> 02:01:38.600]  And of course you can read my articles.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:42.001]  I write two or three a day over at BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[02:01:42.001 --> 02:01:43.542]  Can't say enough nice things about them too.
[02:01:44.758 --> 02:01:46.019]  Yeah, they're awesome.
[02:01:46.019 --> 02:01:48.982]  And, you know, I tell you, if I had the money, I'd hire you away and a few other people.
[02:01:48.982 --> 02:01:51.263]  But that's why I didn't plug the last two hours.
[02:01:51.263 --> 02:01:53.665]  Except for one joke plug about Roger Stone's book.
[02:01:53.665 --> 02:01:54.906]  So that's why I guess we won't be hiring.
[02:01:54.906 --> 02:01:56.928]  We might be laying people off at this rate.
[02:01:56.928 --> 02:01:57.389]  But God bless you.
[02:01:57.389 --> 02:01:59.590]  I may be cheaper than you think, but we've got a plug here.
[02:01:59.590 --> 02:02:03.974]  So I cannot say enough nice things about super male vitality right here.
[02:02:03.974 --> 02:02:05.355]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[02:02:05.355 --> 02:02:06.216]  This is my favorite.
[02:02:06.216 --> 02:02:08.097]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away.
[02:02:08.097 --> 02:02:09.158]  I really think.
[02:02:09.158 --> 02:02:10.379]  I mean, Alex, I don't know.
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:11.900]  How much?
[02:02:44.643 --> 02:02:45.824]  Well, I mean, really, it's true.
[02:02:45.824 --> 02:02:49.007]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[02:02:49.007 --> 02:02:51.330]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:54.372]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[02:02:54.372 --> 02:02:57.475]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before.
[02:02:57.475 --> 02:03:01.519]  With these two here, I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working.
[02:03:01.519 --> 02:03:04.162]  At the end of doing a broadcast, I have the energy to go to a gym.
[02:03:04.682 --> 02:03:08.224]  And frankly, I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[02:03:08.224 --> 02:03:11.306]  It's heartbreaking that Super Male Vitality is about to go away.
[02:03:11.306 --> 02:03:15.208]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[02:03:15.208 --> 02:03:16.329]  But that's what it's all about.
[02:03:16.329 --> 02:03:17.890]  This is the real deal.
[02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:22.873]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day and all of a sudden it's like, whoa, I'm a man again.
[02:03:22.873 --> 02:03:28.076]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[02:03:28.076 --> 02:03:28.676]  It's back.
[02:03:29.096 --> 02:03:32.058]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[02:03:32.058 --> 02:03:37.302]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought for my family.
[02:03:37.302 --> 02:03:39.964]  Everybody loves everything in the Infowar store.
[02:03:39.964 --> 02:03:41.705]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[02:03:41.705 --> 02:03:44.848]  You're supporting the show, you're supporting the Infowar.
[02:03:44.848 --> 02:03:48.050]  And really, as conservatives, who are you going to give your money to?
[02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:53.554]  Are you going to go to the supplement store and give it to somebody who probably advertises on Roku?
[02:03:53.554 --> 02:03:56.116]  Or are you going to give your money directly to Alex Jones?
[02:03:56.116 --> 02:03:57.377]  It's an easy choice, I think.
[02:03:58.530 --> 02:04:04.375]  These are exciting times we live in, and yes, super male vitality or female vitality is an aging process.
[02:04:04.375 --> 02:04:05.396]  It's cold pressed.
[02:04:05.396 --> 02:04:08.939]  It takes three to four times more of the herbs to do it.
[02:04:08.939 --> 02:04:13.402]  And then it's got to basically do its own fermentation, is the way they describe it.
[02:04:13.402 --> 02:04:16.865]  And it's super, super strong for libido, stamina, energy.
[02:04:16.865 --> 02:04:23.451]  When I first heard about it, like six, seven years ago, that was being developed, and I actually tried it, I was like, okay, this actually works.
[02:04:24.171 --> 02:04:26.091]  And I mean, I was big like you were.
[02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:27.392]  I'm still a big guy.
[02:04:27.392 --> 02:04:32.413]  But I mean, I lost 60, 70 pounds with the X2 and with the Super Metal Vitality.
[02:04:32.413 --> 02:04:34.393]  I mean, I was getting up there close to 300 pounds, folks.
[02:04:34.393 --> 02:04:37.174]  For me, I'm kind of little at 230, 240.
[02:04:37.174 --> 02:04:39.554]  I've gained a few pounds back because I barely work out anymore.
[02:04:39.554 --> 02:04:45.976]  And if I wasn't taking it and wasn't taking the X2 and X3, I would definitely be pushing 300 pounds right now.
[02:04:45.976 --> 02:04:51.637]  So get your Super Metal Vitality, the final run, unless, unless me squeezing them makes me down on the price.
[02:04:51.637 --> 02:04:52.857]  So get it today while you still can.
[02:04:56.092 --> 02:05:05.399]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.399 --> 02:05:08.262]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:08.262 --> 02:05:14.307]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:14.967 --> 02:05:21.230]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:27.494]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:27.494 --> 02:05:34.457]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:35.598 --> 02:05:48.630]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.630 --> 02:05:52.893]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:52.893 --> 02:05:55.576]  X3, now available at mpulwerselife.com.
[02:06:02.947 --> 02:06:04.867]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:04.867 --> 02:06:19.051]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:19.051 --> 02:06:24.672]  I gotta tell ya.
[02:06:24.672 --> 02:06:28.593]  I love old Waylon Jennings.
[02:06:28.593 --> 02:06:30.414]  The rest of the outlaw country.
[02:06:31.601 --> 02:06:37.908]  But they were outlaw country talking about girls and smoking a little marijuana.
[02:06:37.908 --> 02:06:39.730]  You don't get more outlaw than in full wars.
[02:06:39.730 --> 02:06:43.874]  And I don't say that with... Well, I do say it with pleasure.
[02:06:43.874 --> 02:06:49.521]  I mean, if we're gonna be put through this stuff, we might as well wear this uniform with pride.
[02:06:50.649 --> 02:06:56.294]  That's what it comes down to, because when you die, folks, you don't want to have the shadows following your soul.
[02:06:56.294 --> 02:07:02.299]  Some measurement of who you are, where God decides to send you to a place where you belong.
[02:07:02.299 --> 02:07:04.761]  Truth is, God doesn't even really send you to hell, in my view.
[02:07:04.761 --> 02:07:06.562]  You just go where you chose to go.
[02:07:06.562 --> 02:07:10.385]  At the last minute, you're not allowed to get out of that decision you made.
[02:07:10.385 --> 02:07:11.947]  Those decisions are final and eternal.
[02:07:13.368 --> 02:07:18.291]  So, if you just joined us, one of the top stories in the country, yesterday and today, Alex Jones banned.
[02:07:18.291 --> 02:07:20.212]  Nobody called me for a request.
[02:07:20.212 --> 02:07:21.313]  No one got my statements.
[02:07:21.313 --> 02:07:24.315]  They just lied about what I said and done and called me to be banned.
[02:07:24.315 --> 02:07:31.079]  But the answer is, not just InfoWars.com, not just our radio and TV stations, but all of you out there, start your own shows.
[02:07:31.779 --> 02:07:36.563]  But also boycotting Roku, boycotting these other places that censor and do all this.
[02:07:36.563 --> 02:07:41.707]  So Tom Papert manages one of our great TV stations that we're on across the country.
[02:07:41.707 --> 02:07:43.869]  And so tell folks about that station and how they find it, Tom.
[02:07:45.083 --> 02:07:53.854]  So locally in Wichita, you're on KCTU 5.4, and if you've got an antenna, you've got 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4.
[02:07:53.854 --> 02:08:01.723]  So nowadays, you've still got the same number of channels, but there's patriots who own low-power TV stations out there where they're going to put on InfoWars.
[02:08:01.723 --> 02:08:03.165]  They might put on Russia Today.
[02:08:03.165 --> 02:08:04.467]  They might put on Newsmax.
[02:08:05.107 --> 02:08:11.271]  It's a whole new renaissance, really, of local TV getting back to how it used to be, back to what it meant in the 50s.
[02:08:11.271 --> 02:08:19.576]  And, you know, we had Connor on earlier in the show talking about what TV used to be and how it used to be that TV was just a representation of society.
[02:08:19.576 --> 02:08:23.278]  And I think that's what we're getting back to with stuff like InfoWars.
[02:08:23.278 --> 02:08:26.360]  I mean, Alex, you're a man in Texas telling it like it is.
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:31.043]  How much more American, how much more reflective of the real America can you get
[02:08:31.583 --> 02:08:37.090]  Than InfoWars, the most censored, the most feared, the most hated by the globalist program out there.
[02:08:37.090 --> 02:08:38.432]  It's really exciting stuff, I think.
[02:08:39.818 --> 02:08:40.178]  It is.
[02:08:40.178 --> 02:08:43.080]  I know Newsmax is exploding.
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:44.920]  RT's good because you'll get a different perspective.
[02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:45.821]  But it's not pro-Russia.
[02:08:45.821 --> 02:08:48.102]  It's kind of leftist sometimes if it's RT America.
[02:08:48.102 --> 02:08:49.102]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:08:49.102 --> 02:08:51.403]  It gives people that choice.
[02:08:51.403 --> 02:08:54.585]  And if you're watching on local TV, tell people about it.
[02:08:54.585 --> 02:08:58.387]  The power of word of mouth is the ultimate game changer.
[02:08:58.387 --> 02:09:01.428]  I mean, obviously under God, but God's the ultimate game changer.
[02:09:01.428 --> 02:09:03.269]  Under that word of mouth, taking action.
[02:09:03.269 --> 02:09:03.969]  Tom, great job.
[02:09:03.969 --> 02:09:04.689]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:09:04.689 --> 02:09:05.650]  Thank you for spending an hour with us.
[02:09:06.633 --> 02:09:07.854]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:09:07.854 --> 02:09:08.634]  I look forward to it.
[02:09:08.634 --> 02:09:09.254]  Thank you.
[02:09:09.254 --> 02:09:15.757]  Okay, John, the developer of the app that shot up the charts to the front page of Roku.
[02:09:15.757 --> 02:09:16.538]  Everybody loved it.
[02:09:16.538 --> 02:09:17.578]  It was working great.
[02:09:17.578 --> 02:09:18.378]  Super professional.
[02:09:18.378 --> 02:09:19.999]  Thanks for building it for us.
[02:09:19.999 --> 02:09:20.780]  It was your idea.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:22.140]  We weren't even officially involved.
[02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:23.701]  I just said, absolutely do it.
[02:09:23.701 --> 02:09:24.201]  You did it.
[02:09:24.201 --> 02:09:28.043]  It shot up the charts to the front page, which they admit was very popular.
[02:09:28.043 --> 02:09:34.286]  The left saw it on the front page, had heart attacks, and about six hours after, it was banned using fake information.
[02:09:35.026 --> 02:09:46.468]  That I was sending armed vigilantes, basically, dangerous people to harass people in Connecticut, which I never did, and I did not do yesterday, and I'm not doing.
[02:09:46.468 --> 02:09:47.288]  I mean, that's insane.
[02:09:47.288 --> 02:09:52.089]  That's Facebook sending antifa to people's houses to say they're going to kill them.
[02:09:52.089 --> 02:09:53.329]  And of course, they get praised for that.
[02:09:53.329 --> 02:09:55.070]  That's not what we do.
[02:09:55.070 --> 02:09:59.310]  But just other points you want to add, and what you see this as.
[02:09:59.310 --> 02:10:00.611]  I see it as a bellwether.
[02:10:00.611 --> 02:10:02.751]  And I think boycotting these groups is good.
[02:10:03.231 --> 02:10:10.639]  As libertarians, as conservatives, as just free speech advocates, but also what you did, innovating new platforms, doing new things, and never giving up.
[02:10:12.563 --> 02:10:15.606]  Yeah, I think this is definitely a sign of the times.
[02:10:15.606 --> 02:10:22.952]  We've heard about recent information about NewsGuard, strategies like that, where they're trying to put things on a device level.
[02:10:22.952 --> 02:10:25.755]  We're just now starting to see the next level of censorship.
[02:10:25.755 --> 02:10:35.744]  I understand Facebook is using artificial intelligence now to identify memes, even when they're changed, where they can tag those Snopes articles at the bottom of it.
[02:10:36.305 --> 02:10:41.414]  Um, and as far as TV streaming devices go, I didn't even know about cloud TV.
[02:10:41.414 --> 02:10:43.477]  I would support it.
[02:10:43.477 --> 02:10:46.062]  I definitely encourage people to go out there and get it.
[02:10:46.062 --> 02:10:49.168]  We're still gonna try to keep this Roku app available as long as we can.
[02:10:50.187 --> 02:10:54.570]  And there's also another platform called Kodi, K-O-D-I.
[02:10:54.570 --> 02:10:56.952]  It's an open source TV streaming platform.
[02:10:56.952 --> 02:11:04.077]  I understand that somebody built an InfoWars plug-in for it a number of years ago, around 2015.
[02:11:04.077 --> 02:11:12.103]  There's a GitHub with source code, so I'm going to look into developing that and see if we can develop something very similar that's running on open source platforms.
[02:11:12.844 --> 02:11:21.179]  It runs on Raspberry Pi as equipment, so there's a lot of things we can do to try to bring this to the masses, but it's definitely a sign of the times.
[02:11:22.813 --> 02:11:27.938]  What was it like to build it, to do it, to have your wife help you, and then to just see it super popular Russian, you know, the top.
[02:11:43.792 --> 02:11:47.678]  Like our Apple app went to number one in news and then they go, this is bad.
[02:11:47.678 --> 02:11:49.480]  We decide you don't get it.
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:58.474]  I mean, it's one thing if they delete something that is a crap app or is a scam, but when it's number one or it shoots the top, people inherently don't like winners being held back.
[02:12:00.888 --> 02:12:03.610]  Yeah, I was really taken aback by it.
[02:12:03.610 --> 02:12:11.077]  I actually had gone out for a bit, and Tom was out promoting the app, and I came back to my computer and he said, people are saying there's a problem with the app.
[02:12:11.077 --> 02:12:13.319]  They're getting this error message, can't find it.
[02:12:13.319 --> 02:12:16.062]  It was still listed in the store, but once they tried to install it, it was...
[02:12:16.983 --> 02:12:17.843]  It was giving an error.
[02:12:17.843 --> 02:12:20.506]  I mean, I thought I accidentally deleted or something.
[02:12:20.506 --> 02:12:22.949]  I had never thought that it would happen this quickly.
[02:12:22.949 --> 02:12:24.851]  I had saw the ratings.
[02:12:24.851 --> 02:12:28.655]  We had seven ratings and the average was 4.4 stars.
[02:12:28.655 --> 02:12:30.637]  It was doing really well.
[02:12:30.637 --> 02:12:37.945]  And it was a really great experience, very educational to learn the Roku platform, the BrightScript programming language that it runs on.
[02:12:38.625 --> 02:12:47.967]  And I had a lot of faith in Roku, but that's been lost, and I understand they were just under pressure, but we can't continue to allow this to happen.
[02:12:47.967 --> 02:12:51.988]  We have to, as conservatives, get a backbone and start standing up to it.
[02:12:51.988 --> 02:13:02.651]  My call to technical people, professionals, programmers, is to start getting creative about how you can be a part of this as well, and it's going to take a team of
[02:13:03.451 --> 02:13:09.736]  Of people who are dedicated and skilled to fight back against this technocratic censorship.
[02:13:09.736 --> 02:13:17.982]  Well that's right, and the Washington Post and New York Times both say what took it over the top was the company said we've monitored it, we're not seeing anything illegal.
[02:13:19.281 --> 02:13:22.542]  I mean, we're mild compared to MSNBC saying kill the president and all this stuff.
[02:13:22.542 --> 02:13:23.382]  We don't call for violence.
[02:13:23.382 --> 02:13:24.403]  Everybody knows that.
[02:13:24.403 --> 02:13:25.683]  We don't call for offense to violence.
[02:13:25.683 --> 02:13:30.564]  Somebody starts a fight, take it to them 100% and get them out of your way, your family's way.
[02:13:30.564 --> 02:13:36.226]  But it was the lawyers and from the Sandy Hook families, who obviously are political operatives, Democrats, they admit that.
[02:13:36.226 --> 02:13:38.187]  They say, we want him off the air.
[02:13:38.187 --> 02:13:39.247]  He's harassing the families.
[02:13:39.247 --> 02:13:40.508]  He won't stop sending people here.
[02:13:40.508 --> 02:13:41.528]  He's doing it currently.
[02:13:42.068 --> 02:13:43.089]  And they went, really?
[02:13:43.089 --> 02:13:46.331]  And they said, he's doing it currently, which I never did.
[02:13:46.331 --> 02:13:53.695]  And so it was that system-wide claim that I was using the platform for something I wasn't.
[02:13:56.736 --> 02:13:59.958]  They have engaged in that, and it's very dastardly.
[02:13:59.958 --> 02:14:01.359]  It's very wicked.
[02:14:01.359 --> 02:14:03.300]  And I'm going to stand up to it.
[02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:06.242]  And I think people are going to understand that this is wrong.
[02:14:06.242 --> 02:14:14.667]  To keep saying things in my name that I didn't say, and then even when I say, hey, I didn't say that, please stop, they go, no, we're going to keep saying it.
[02:14:14.667 --> 02:14:16.007]  It's just a new level.
[02:14:16.007 --> 02:14:20.090]  And just because the mainstream media backs these people doing it, it's despicable.
[02:14:21.588 --> 02:14:25.009]  It's important to note that there was a slew of articles.
[02:14:25.009 --> 02:14:32.632]  I mean, we just did a DuckDuckGo search for Roku Alex Jones to try to get a pulse on what was happening in the timeline.
[02:14:32.632 --> 02:14:41.995]  And, I mean, articles going back 10, 11 hours prior, and this was at 8 o'clock when we were looking at it, it showed a timeline where they were writing articles in TechCrunch and Mashable.
[02:14:42.635 --> 02:14:49.761]  And the Hollywood Reporter saying, you know, trying to slander Roku for supporting the app and Roku defending it.
[02:14:49.761 --> 02:14:52.023]  And they just kept trying to make an example out of them.
[02:14:52.023 --> 02:14:59.390]  So, I mean, does the conservative press have, you know, a similar type of army of journalists that can fight back?
[02:14:59.390 --> 02:15:06.476]  I think that's what we need is independent journalists and other people to create their own shows so we have a similar platform.
[02:15:06.476 --> 02:15:10.039]  But it's gotten into the New York Times, Washington Post did an article this morning
[02:15:11.099 --> 02:15:12.360]  Listen, and they all get republished.
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:15.062]  Thousands of articles total globally right now.
[02:15:15.062 --> 02:15:18.764]  It's all over TV, and they get to piggyback more lies.
[02:15:18.764 --> 02:15:21.245]  Jones was sending people to their houses right now!
[02:15:21.245 --> 02:15:26.708]  And so again, they piggyback all those lies on there, and then they set the precedent to get these organized brigades of leftists
[02:15:27.148 --> 02:15:31.250]  To go out and basically burn down other free speech institutions.
[02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:37.493]  They're building an aggressive, hateful army, and they are bullies, the very definition of it.
[02:15:37.493 --> 02:15:39.473]  Alright, God bless you, John.
[02:15:39.473 --> 02:15:41.034]  Keep it up, we really appreciate it.

[02:16:54.527 --> 02:17:00.873]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:00.873 --> 02:17:03.595]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:03.915 --> 02:17:09.838]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:09.838 --> 02:17:13.620]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the Empire.
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:14.900]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:15.901]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:15.901 --> 02:17:22.444]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[02:17:24.665 --> 02:17:25.885]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:17:25.885 --> 02:17:29.807]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:29.807 --> 02:17:31.348]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:31.348 --> 02:17:34.309]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:34.309 --> 02:17:39.871]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:39.871 --> 02:17:41.071]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:41.071 --> 02:17:44.012]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[02:19:59.165 --> 02:20:09.930]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.930 --> 02:20:11.110]  You found it.
[02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:13.151]  The tip of the spear.
[02:20:13.151 --> 02:20:16.513]  It is The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.513 --> 02:20:23.196]  I hear people talking right about the way we have to live here in this country.
[02:20:25.413 --> 02:20:30.742]  Harpin' on wars, big fights and gripin' bout the great things of the beat.
[02:20:33.182 --> 02:20:58.398]  And I don't mind them switchin' sides and standin' up for the things they believe in When they're runnin' down my country, man, they're walkin' on the fightin' side of me Yeah, walkin' on the fightin' side of me Runnin' down the way of life, I'm fightin' it hard to die today
[02:21:00.359 --> 02:21:02.580]  If you don't love it, leave it.
[02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:07.923]  Let this song I'm singing be a warning.
[02:21:07.923 --> 02:21:10.404]  You're running down my country, man.
[02:21:10.404 --> 02:21:14.846]  You're walking on a fight inside me.
[02:21:14.846 --> 02:21:15.386]  We are back.
[02:21:15.386 --> 02:21:21.508]  I thought old Merle Haggard, God bless his soul, he left us to be with the Lord in 2018.
[02:21:24.286 --> 02:21:25.788]  Listen to this.
[02:21:25.788 --> 02:21:28.310]  They love our milk and honey!
[02:21:40.303 --> 02:21:56.448]  They love our milk and honey But they preach about some other way of living And they're running down my country horse They're walking on the fighting side of me Yeah, walking on the fighting side of me
[02:22:03.232 --> 02:22:08.816]  It's hard to turn on old Merle Haggard, isn't it?
[02:22:08.816 --> 02:22:11.799]  Man, his whole life, what an American success story.
[02:22:11.799 --> 02:22:12.479]  Bye-bye, Merle.
[02:22:12.479 --> 02:22:16.823]  We love you.
[02:22:16.823 --> 02:22:27.731]  He was born, if my memory serves, in a railway car during the Big Dust Bowl when the panhandle of Texas and Oklahoma collapsed.
[02:22:28.872 --> 02:22:32.393]  And all the topsoil blew away because they were over-farming.
[02:22:32.393 --> 02:22:37.795]  And he was born in a railway car that they had in Hobo.
[02:22:37.795 --> 02:22:43.397]  I mean, you know, people knew people were getting on them to go to California where they could be farmers.
[02:22:43.397 --> 02:22:51.620]  And he was born, I think the one account I read was right as they were going over the California line in the boxcar.
[02:22:53.655 --> 02:22:57.917]  So, uh, the Okie from Muskogee was actually born in California.
[02:22:57.917 --> 02:23:04.500]  And then, uh, we still flow glory down to courthouse and white light and it's still the greatest thrill hall.
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:11.444]  I remember growing up, my family being proud of being Texans and proud of being hardworking and proud of America.
[02:23:11.444 --> 02:23:14.485]  And I thought it was obnoxious, like kind of an elitism.
[02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:15.506]  And it wasn't an elitism.
[02:23:15.506 --> 02:23:16.426]  My parents weren't elitist.
[02:23:16.426 --> 02:23:17.487]  My family wasn't elitist.
[02:23:17.487 --> 02:23:21.549]  They were nice, good Christian people, but it was because they knew people had been trying to take it away from us.
[02:23:22.677 --> 02:23:25.538]  That was their identity.
[02:23:25.538 --> 02:23:30.199]  And I grow up and I see these globalists, how much they hate this country, how they want to run it in the ground.
[02:23:30.199 --> 02:23:31.579]  You better damn believe they're your enemy.
[02:23:31.579 --> 02:23:35.820]  You better damn believe the New York Times and Washington Post are the enemy of the American people.
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:38.440]  And they're getting ready to false flag themselves because Trump says that.
[02:23:38.440 --> 02:23:39.981]  And you go, oh look, you may just get attacked.
[02:23:39.981 --> 02:23:42.041]  No, you'll attack your own damn selves.
[02:23:42.041 --> 02:23:42.601]  We all know that.
[02:23:42.601 --> 02:23:43.682]  You scum.
[02:23:43.682 --> 02:23:45.242]  They're private intelligence agencies.
[02:23:46.291 --> 02:23:58.513]  They're all a bunch of cowards and yes men who line up and kiss the ass of corrupt lawyers and corrupt FBI agents that are all a bunch of candy asses and all fake and all followers.
[02:23:58.513 --> 02:24:04.494]  And that's what it comes down to in the final equation.
[02:24:04.494 --> 02:24:07.115]  And I'm not saying all the FBI agents are bad, not to kiss their ass.
[02:24:07.115 --> 02:24:07.655]  It's the truth.
[02:24:07.655 --> 02:24:13.676]  Some of the best people are FBI agents, but the people at the top that the Clintons put in are the scum of the earth.
[02:24:16.351 --> 02:24:18.233]  I've known FBI agents, grew up around some of them.
[02:24:18.233 --> 02:24:23.457]  Good, Christian, hard-working, Boy Scout, you know, 20 hours a day on cases.
[02:24:23.457 --> 02:24:27.880]  But those are the guys they've got doing bank robberies and child kidnapping.
[02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:38.008]  They got a bunch of scumbag lawyers up top running these things, and man, they are the biggest group of Eddie Haskell jerks the planet's ever seen.
[02:24:38.008 --> 02:24:41.510]  You know, I'm going to get to these videos next segment, because I've started pontificating here.
[02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:42.791]  We've got a lady flipping out in
[02:24:43.945 --> 02:24:45.886]  The local area, pulling down Alex Jones sign.
[02:24:45.886 --> 02:24:47.486]  Somebody put up, somebody caught it.
[02:24:47.486 --> 02:24:49.507]  And just how crazy she is, is amazing.
[02:24:49.507 --> 02:24:50.187]  We're going to play that.
[02:24:50.187 --> 02:24:56.409]  There's this Washington Post thing I mentioned, the case for banning Alex Jones, that is amazing.
[02:24:56.409 --> 02:25:01.831]  We're going to play that video.
[02:25:01.831 --> 02:25:09.233]  And we're going to get ready for the next host to come over and take over Roger Stone.
[02:25:10.609 --> 02:25:16.774]  There's a lot of other news I didn't hit and quite frankly I opened the show with what we probably should have talked about the whole time.
[02:25:16.774 --> 02:25:22.259]  Because it's a big deal when Sean Hannity gets up on television.
[02:25:23.570 --> 02:25:28.617]  And word for word says what I've said about the ongoing live coup against the president.
[02:25:28.617 --> 02:25:33.284]  You know, Media Matters grabs it and goes, look, Sean Hannity's channeling Alex Jones.
[02:25:33.284 --> 02:25:34.625]  Sean Hannity's plagiarizing.
[02:25:34.625 --> 02:25:40.514]  Now, Sean Hannity works like 14 hours a day, and I know he watches some of the show, and I'm gonna leave it at that.
[02:25:43.855 --> 02:25:46.597]  He gets info wars now in the last four or five years.
[02:25:46.597 --> 02:25:50.280]  Four or five years ago he started getting info wars and understood our perspective.
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:54.783]  Because he was such a Boy Scout, he didn't believe all this dirt and stuff before.
[02:25:54.783 --> 02:25:56.684]  He thought I was exaggerating or making it up.
[02:25:56.684 --> 02:26:02.268]  Now he's like, oh now I see why I came towards Hannity and he came towards me.
[02:26:02.268 --> 02:26:04.250]  Because I was younger and didn't know a lot of stuff.
[02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:06.792]  He was older and knew a lot of things, but he was also naive.
[02:26:06.792 --> 02:26:12.196]  And so I figured out I wasn't right about everything, but he was naive and we were pretty much on the same page now.
[02:26:13.772 --> 02:26:19.537]  But, to have him with, let me tell you, Nielsen scams anybody that's a patriot.
[02:26:19.537 --> 02:26:22.240]  The word is it's 8 million viewers a night, not 5 million.
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:25.443]  That's double that dumbass Maddow.
[02:26:25.443 --> 02:26:28.386]  And Nielsen's been caught faking ratings for leftists many times.
[02:26:28.386 --> 02:26:29.307]  They've been caught.
[02:26:29.307 --> 02:26:30.047]  It's a fraud.
[02:26:30.047 --> 02:26:30.528]  Okay?
[02:26:30.528 --> 02:26:31.389]  Just like these polls.
[02:26:31.389 --> 02:26:32.309]  Shock polls!
[02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:33.511]  Alexandria Cortez!
[02:26:34.864 --> 02:26:36.465]  A shock poll!
[02:26:36.465 --> 02:26:39.827]  Alexandra Cortez tied with Trump in polls.
[02:26:39.827 --> 02:26:44.190]  Hillary was 30-something points ahead the week of the election according to CNN.
[02:26:44.190 --> 02:26:48.933]  Those polls don't mean a damn thing except to weak-minded people.
[02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:51.514]  So, what am I getting at here?
[02:26:51.514 --> 02:27:01.940]  The fact that Hannity in the article and the videos posted on Infowars.com comes right out and says there's an active coup against the president and then in 13 minutes
[02:27:04.039 --> 02:27:12.023]  The first segment, he lays it out in solid country gold.
[02:27:12.023 --> 02:27:20.307]  I mean, to quote a great country artist, the voice coming out of those speakers was solid country gold.
[02:27:20.307 --> 02:27:22.608]  Should probably come in with that song.
[02:27:22.608 --> 02:27:24.329]  I'm about to get on the country music kick.
[02:27:24.329 --> 02:27:27.711]  See, I'm in a good mood right now, actually.
[02:27:27.711 --> 02:27:32.033]  So, that gets me listening to country music.
[02:27:34.594 --> 02:27:41.258]  Man, I want to be riding around in a truck somewhere out on the Ponderosa.
[02:27:41.258 --> 02:27:44.260]  You know, we still got a piece of the Ponderosa out in East Texas.
[02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:45.480]  A piece of the land we used to have.
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:48.782]  We used to be land barons, pretty much.
[02:27:48.782 --> 02:27:50.724]  Had family involved, a bunch of stuff.
[02:27:50.724 --> 02:27:52.845]  Founding of Texas railroads.
[02:27:52.845 --> 02:27:56.247]  Family had a spur of a railroad.
[02:27:56.247 --> 02:27:59.429]  Pretty wild stories, too, about the ten years of occupation.
[02:28:00.558 --> 02:28:01.839]  Reconstruction.
[02:28:01.839 --> 02:28:06.603]  Those aren't stories, though, you're gonna get in the history books, because the history books are full of lies, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:06.603 --> 02:28:07.103]  All lies.
[02:28:07.103 --> 02:28:17.432]  So when we come back, a self-identified member of Berkeley Antifa was caught tearing down flyers featuring Laura Loomer and Alex Jones outside Twitter San Francisco, California headquarters.
[02:28:17.432 --> 02:28:18.472]  Her reason?
[02:28:18.472 --> 02:28:21.555]  There's no free speech for Nazi punk.
[02:28:27.116 --> 02:28:31.879]  Listen, Goblin Watch, can we cue up the original Goblin in Seattle?
[02:28:31.879 --> 02:28:40.265]  When goblins attack and we actually put the, you know, literal vampire pot-bellied goblins coming after you?
[02:28:40.265 --> 02:28:49.172]  I mean, there's nothing like a low-IQ, slobbering goblin coming for your First Amendment.
[02:28:49.172 --> 02:28:53.395]  Look, we will beat these people, but you gotta understand, this is just a victim right here.
[02:28:55.140 --> 02:28:57.862]  Bacon lovers, we ship free!

[02:29:25.183 --> 02:29:26.404]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:29:26.404 --> 02:29:30.346]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:30.346 --> 02:29:31.867]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:31.867 --> 02:29:34.829]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:34.829 --> 02:29:40.392]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:40.392 --> 02:29:41.593]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:41.593 --> 02:29:44.534]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:44.534 --> 02:29:46.756]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:46.756 --> 02:29:51.198]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:29:51.198 --> 02:29:53.499]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:29:56.189 --> 02:30:06.772]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:30:06.772 --> 02:30:08.832]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:30:08.832 --> 02:30:11.693]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:30:11.693 --> 02:30:13.194]  It's made in the USA.
[02:30:13.194 --> 02:30:20.015]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:30:20.015 --> 02:30:21.276]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:30:22.096 --> 02:30:31.804]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:30:31.804 --> 02:30:48.637]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:30:48.637 --> 02:30:51.780]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:55.279]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslive.com.

[02:33:08.015 --> 02:33:14.020]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[02:33:14.020 --> 02:33:17.604]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:33:17.604 --> 02:33:19.245]  He was dressed like 1950.
[02:33:19.245 --> 02:33:21.287]  He was dressed like 1950.
[02:33:21.287 --> 02:33:23.489]  Half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:33:24.466 --> 02:33:26.907]  He said it's a long walk to Nashville.
[02:33:26.907 --> 02:33:29.048]  Would you like to ride, son?
[02:33:29.048 --> 02:33:31.730]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:31.730 --> 02:33:36.532]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:36.532 --> 02:33:38.934]  He sat down in the front seat.
[02:33:38.934 --> 02:33:40.234]  He turned on the radio.
[02:33:40.234 --> 02:33:43.016]  And them sad... Let's put a little bit more of this.
[02:33:44.304 --> 02:33:46.106]  Hey, don't tell me on camera.
[02:33:46.106 --> 02:33:47.208]  Come here, coward.
[02:33:47.208 --> 02:33:48.229]  Come here, coward.
[02:33:48.229 --> 02:33:49.350]  Right here on camera.
[02:33:49.350 --> 02:33:49.611]  Right here.
[02:33:49.611 --> 02:33:51.093]  Tell people intellectually who you are.
[02:33:51.093 --> 02:33:51.954]  Intellectually who I am?
[02:33:51.954 --> 02:33:52.635]  Go ahead, yeah, yeah.
[02:33:52.635 --> 02:33:53.456]  Yeah, I'm your mama.
[02:33:53.456 --> 02:33:54.177]  You can't even talk.
[02:33:54.177 --> 02:33:55.218]  Look at you.
[02:33:55.218 --> 02:33:58.082]  This is what they've turned the people into.
[02:33:58.082 --> 02:33:59.263]  This is it right here.
[02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:00.364]  Literal slave of the system.
[02:34:01.423 --> 02:34:02.284]  See that?
[02:34:02.284 --> 02:34:05.648]  That's who they are.
[02:34:05.648 --> 02:34:06.969]  Look at the slave.
[02:34:06.969 --> 02:34:09.292]  That was great.
[02:34:09.292 --> 02:34:11.454]  Go ahead.
[02:34:11.454 --> 02:34:13.636]  Go ahead.
[02:34:13.636 --> 02:34:14.517]  Go ahead.
[02:34:14.517 --> 02:34:15.098]  I'm out.
[02:34:28.379 --> 02:34:35.483]  That is kind of a version by David Allen Coe of a crazy outlaw guy.
[02:34:35.483 --> 02:34:37.665]  Obviously crazier than you know what.
[02:34:37.665 --> 02:34:42.768]  But kind of a version of it's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll by ACDC.
[02:34:42.768 --> 02:34:48.112]  Because I'm going to Alabama.
[02:34:48.112 --> 02:34:49.833]  As I stepped out of that Cadillac
[02:34:51.188 --> 02:34:53.091]  I said, mister, many thanks.
[02:34:53.091 --> 02:34:53.752]  He said?
[02:34:53.752 --> 02:34:56.075]  He said, you don't have to call me mister, mister.
[02:35:05.611 --> 02:35:07.113]  That's enough.
[02:35:07.113 --> 02:35:12.316]  I'm going to get out of the country music.
[02:35:12.316 --> 02:35:13.878]  I'm going to start listening all day.
[02:35:13.878 --> 02:35:23.405]  You know, Keith Whitley, though, is, because I love George Strait, he's probably my favorite, but Keith Whitley, I wish he'd live longer because every song he did is excellent.
[02:35:23.405 --> 02:35:30.090]  Raging alcoholic, madman, real Dukes of Hazzard type stuff, you know, in Kentucky, jumping cars off cliffs and everything.
[02:35:30.090 --> 02:35:31.531]  I mean, it was, he was nuts.
[02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:43.255]  He's the only music where if I listen to it, it then plays in my head with fidelity.
[02:35:43.255 --> 02:35:46.036]  Like other songs, you can kind of hear them in your head if you want to.
[02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:50.879]  With Keith Whitley, I can't get it out of my head and I can't stop listening to it.
[02:35:50.879 --> 02:35:52.700]  Gosh, it's bad.
[02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:55.301]  Can we play a Keith Whitley song right now?
[02:35:55.301 --> 02:35:57.302]  Wouldn't that just be better?
[02:35:57.302 --> 02:35:57.983]  It's amazing
[02:36:04.457 --> 02:36:08.100]  It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
[02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:12.403]  Without saying a word, you can light up the
[02:36:32.402 --> 02:36:36.945]  That's the best part right here.
[02:36:36.945 --> 02:36:42.629]  That's not even one of the best Keith Whitley songs.
[02:37:03.925 --> 02:37:06.168]  Yeah, you say it best.
[02:37:06.168 --> 02:37:17.440]  You know, when the listeners thank me for how great I am, you understand the whole reason we're here is you.
[02:37:24.696 --> 02:37:27.197]  I mean, you're like 99.99% of it.
[02:37:27.197 --> 02:37:28.637]  It's a sick joke.
[02:37:28.637 --> 02:37:30.578]  Thank yourself and thank God, and I want to thank you.
[02:37:30.578 --> 02:37:32.019]  It's the same thing.
[02:37:32.019 --> 02:37:33.739]  And I know you want to thank me, but you know what?
[02:37:33.739 --> 02:37:36.580]  Thank me, and I thank you by taking action.
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:37.481]  Let's take action.
[02:37:37.481 --> 02:37:39.061]  Let's get serious.
[02:37:39.061 --> 02:37:42.723]  Like Laura Loomer going and taking illegal aliens to Nancy Pelosi's house.
[02:37:42.723 --> 02:37:43.523]  They tried to ignore it.
[02:37:43.523 --> 02:37:45.023]  It blew up big.
[02:37:45.023 --> 02:37:45.824]  That's action.
[02:37:45.824 --> 02:37:48.845]  I admire her.
[02:37:48.845 --> 02:37:51.746]  And, you know, then I see anti-Semites out there because she's Jewish, putting her down.
[02:37:52.523 --> 02:37:53.964]  You know, that's a load of crap.
[02:37:53.964 --> 02:37:55.264]  She's fighting the globalist agenda.
[02:37:55.264 --> 02:38:01.707]  There are globalist Jews, there's anti-globalist Jews, there's commie Jews, there's Christian Jews, there's... Just like there's everything.
[02:38:01.707 --> 02:38:05.669]  There's commie blacks, patriot blacks... It's people, man!
[02:38:05.669 --> 02:38:19.795]  You know, the left claims they're all about everybody being together, but all they tell you is what color you are, where you're from, what you're doing, and then they bring in people they've weaponized so that those of us in the most open society in the world gotta feel like we're the bad guys and done something wrong.
[02:38:19.795 --> 02:38:20.195]  I'm done.
[02:38:21.618 --> 02:38:35.704]  And I wasn't intimidated by him, but I gotta tell you, this latest line they crossed, I just hope I can stay in this place I am forever now, because it's not an arrogance, it's not even a confidence, it's a commitment.
[02:38:35.704 --> 02:38:44.147]  And I just got like a whole bunch of clicks closer to God in the last 24 hours.
[02:38:44.147 --> 02:38:47.988]  And everybody, I was talking to Kit and other people I know, and they're like, are you feeling this?
[02:38:47.988 --> 02:38:49.049]  I was talking to a neighbor this morning,
[02:38:50.791 --> 02:39:03.683]  And they're like, you know, Alex, I didn't used to really believe all what you say, but I just, I just last night had a dream and I just feel like, the neighbor said like, it was just, it was like an epiphany, but I just got closer to God.
[02:39:03.683 --> 02:39:10.849]  And I'm looking at this neighbor and I had just told my wife that in the house 10 minutes before.
[02:39:10.849 --> 02:39:12.931]  And I'm telling you, there's an internet of minds.
[02:39:12.931 --> 02:39:15.774]  There's, there's an ether and it's happening.
[02:39:15.774 --> 02:39:17.135]  You felt it too, didn't you?
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:22.362]  Just pray that Christ's spirit come into the earth.
[02:39:22.362 --> 02:39:26.004]  Because you know, the earth from of the devil.
[02:39:26.004 --> 02:39:29.006]  And we have free will, but we have to ask God in.
[02:39:29.006 --> 02:39:32.689]  Not just our hearts, into the planet.
[02:39:32.689 --> 02:39:35.110]  And we have to do that.
[02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:41.795]  And you pray to ask God into the planet, in the name of Jesus Christ, the enemy doesn't like that.
[02:39:41.795 --> 02:39:44.076]  Because let me tell you, Jesus Christ is real, folks.
[02:39:44.076 --> 02:39:44.877]  And this fight is real.
[02:39:46.923 --> 02:39:48.144]  I'm going to stop preaching.
[02:39:48.144 --> 02:39:58.912]  You know, I don't want to make fun of this lady, but, you know, in the Goblin video, we should probably show the whole thing sometime, because like five people or six people have just said, F you, F your family.
[02:39:58.912 --> 02:40:01.093]  I'm just trying to walk down the street in Seattle.
[02:40:01.093 --> 02:40:05.617]  He says a bunch of stuff, F you, so I run over to him and I say, well, here, tell me, because none of them will talk to me.
[02:40:05.617 --> 02:40:08.138]  They all go, F you, F your family, because they hate families.
[02:40:08.138 --> 02:40:09.219]  None of them have families.
[02:40:09.219 --> 02:40:11.241]  And then they run.
[02:40:11.241 --> 02:40:14.623]  What they mean is, I hate your life force.
[02:40:14.623 --> 02:40:15.404]  I hate you with God.
[02:40:16.482 --> 02:40:17.503]  And they always act the same.
[02:40:17.503 --> 02:40:19.223]  He throws hot coffee on me, which he just filled.
[02:40:19.223 --> 02:40:20.804]  It was scalding hot coffee.
[02:40:20.804 --> 02:40:21.505]  Oh, it wasn't hot.
[02:40:21.505 --> 02:40:22.565]  Jones put me in a wimp.
[02:40:22.565 --> 02:40:28.368]  I mean, it kind of felt good in a way, because I'm the type of guy that eats pizza too hot and kind of like, next day, just pulls the skin off the roof of their mouth.
[02:40:28.368 --> 02:40:30.049]  I'm kind of a Neanderthal.
[02:40:30.049 --> 02:40:36.713]  But the point is, is that experiencing this, he's just one we caught on tape.
[02:40:36.713 --> 02:40:38.114]  Zegerman, he's not a coward.
[02:40:38.114 --> 02:40:40.235]  He just didn't want to go outside the hotel anymore.
[02:40:40.235 --> 02:40:44.357]  Because, I mean, I'd walk five feet out the hotel and ask you, you're going to die, you piece of shit!
[02:40:46.822 --> 02:40:47.983]  Like zombies.
[02:40:47.983 --> 02:40:52.846]  Well, this latest video is another goblin sighting.
[02:40:52.846 --> 02:40:57.429]  Hobbling goblin, stumbling around, coming after me.
[02:40:57.429 --> 02:41:02.092]  Spirit gets close to it and just... Don't want to go there!
[02:41:02.092 --> 02:41:07.576]  Because that big spider... This is not a bad person.
[02:41:07.576 --> 02:41:14.000]  Like, it, the clown, is just a tentacle of a big intergalactic spider down a mineshaft.
[02:41:15.071 --> 02:41:21.038]  And it's got its finger up, and the clown is just its little manifestation of a tentacle.
[02:41:21.038 --> 02:41:21.959]  Like an angler fish.
[02:41:21.959 --> 02:41:23.120]  Come on over here.
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.123]  So this poor woman is a captured spirit.
[02:41:26.123 --> 02:41:31.169]  And she's just stumbling around with pleasure, exercising her power to stop your speech.
[02:41:31.169 --> 02:41:32.551]  This is in San Francisco.
[02:41:32.551 --> 02:41:34.172]  Laura Loomer and Alex Jones signs.
[02:41:34.172 --> 02:41:35.133]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:41:35.133 --> 02:41:35.394]  Here it is.
[02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:38.760]  Have a look Blake.
[02:41:55.231 --> 02:41:56.853]  There's no free speech for Nazis.
[02:41:56.853 --> 02:41:58.515]  She's literally financed by a Nazi.
[02:41:58.515 --> 02:41:59.035]  George Soros.
[02:41:59.035 --> 02:41:59.416]  Alright.
[02:42:18.763 --> 02:42:28.946]  And just that act, of you going out and putting up an Alex Jones poster, or whatever you want to defend as free speech, go out, watch them attack, and then say, when they say Nazi, go, really?
[02:42:28.946 --> 02:42:30.607]  Like George Soros that funds Antifa and his son?
[02:42:30.607 --> 02:42:33.348]  The Nazi collaborator?
[02:42:33.348 --> 02:42:34.728]  Then upload it.
[02:42:34.728 --> 02:42:36.589]  And just every bit of that is what matters.
[02:42:38.544 --> 02:42:41.085]  But again, she calls you a Nazi, she gets to humanize you.
[02:42:41.085 --> 02:42:41.966]  Hey lady!
[02:42:41.966 --> 02:42:43.267]  America beat the Nazis!
[02:42:43.267 --> 02:42:48.170]  And other nation states, like Russia, you don't sit there and call us Nazis!
[02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:48.930]  We beat you!
[02:42:48.930 --> 02:42:50.931]  We beat your God, Soros!
[02:42:50.931 --> 02:42:51.932]  We beat your Lord!
[02:42:55.174 --> 02:43:03.560]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:04.801]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:04.801 --> 02:43:09.744]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.744 --> 02:43:12.806]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.

[02:43:14.968 --> 02:43:35.126]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:43:55.083 --> 02:43:58.546]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:43:58.546 --> 02:44:02.329]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:44:02.329 --> 02:44:08.594]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:44:08.594 --> 02:44:11.357]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:44:12.097 --> 02:44:15.923]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:44:15.923 --> 02:44:22.393]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:44:22.393 --> 02:44:27.360]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:44:28.101 --> 02:44:32.024]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:44:32.024 --> 02:44:39.229]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:44:39.229 --> 02:44:43.932]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:44:43.932 --> 02:44:50.137]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:44:50.137 --> 02:44:54.120]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:44:57.762 --> 02:45:03.405]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:45:03.405 --> 02:45:06.546]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:45:06.546 --> 02:45:09.208]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:45:09.208 --> 02:45:13.510]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:20.894]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:45:20.894 --> 02:45:23.415]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[02:45:26.872 --> 02:45:28.712]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:45:28.712 --> 02:45:32.493]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:45:32.493 --> 02:45:44.016]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:45:44.016 --> 02:45:46.297]  It's the David Knight Show!
[02:45:46.297 --> 02:45:48.777]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:45:48.777 --> 02:45:49.437]  I mean, what?
[02:45:49.437 --> 02:45:50.798]  I mean, never!
[02:45:54.635 --> 02:46:01.083]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:46:01.083 --> 02:46:09.934]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:46:10.515 --> 02:46:15.318]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:46:59.196 --> 02:47:07.880]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:09.401]  If you leave me...
[02:47:25.715 --> 02:47:29.557]  I won't miss you, and I won't ever take you back.
[02:47:29.557 --> 02:47:38.541]  This morning I was thinking, and I thought, we need a Hank Williams Jr.
[02:47:38.541 --> 02:47:41.642]  Jr., and we've got one, he's pretty wild.
[02:47:41.642 --> 02:47:45.284]  But what we really need is George Strait Jr.
[02:47:48.534 --> 02:47:52.116]  I guess his daughter played guitar.
[02:47:52.116 --> 02:47:53.017]  She died in a car wreck at 13.
[02:47:53.017 --> 02:47:54.818]  So I actually stalked these people.
[02:47:54.818 --> 02:47:56.199]  That's who I stalked.
[02:47:56.199 --> 02:47:57.300]  Not Hollywood or anybody else.
[02:47:57.300 --> 02:48:04.846]  The great thing about George Strait is he seems like a cartoon because he sings so perfect.
[02:48:04.846 --> 02:48:05.767]  And the cowboy hat and all.
[02:48:05.767 --> 02:48:07.268]  But he's actually from South Texas.
[02:48:07.268 --> 02:48:08.709]  From a ranching family.
[02:48:08.709 --> 02:48:09.930]  Army veteran.
[02:48:09.930 --> 02:48:11.291]  Self-made.
[02:48:11.291 --> 02:48:12.372]  Real McCoy.
[02:48:12.372 --> 02:48:13.192]  Real deal.
[02:48:13.192 --> 02:48:13.953]  Down to earth.
[02:48:13.953 --> 02:48:15.815]  Greatest guy you could know.
[02:48:15.815 --> 02:48:17.075]  It's amazing.
[02:48:17.075 --> 02:48:17.536]  Isn't that cool?
[02:48:19.008 --> 02:48:20.248]  George Strait.
[02:48:20.248 --> 02:48:23.369]  Love him.
[02:48:23.369 --> 02:48:24.910]  Bubba Strait.
[02:48:24.910 --> 02:48:27.090]  There is a George Strait Jr.
[02:48:27.090 --> 02:48:28.650]  We just wish he was touring the nation.
[02:48:28.650 --> 02:48:32.632]  We need to clone George Strait, don't we?
[02:48:32.632 --> 02:48:34.172]  People all over the world love George Strait.
[02:48:34.172 --> 02:48:35.012]  He sold more than the Beatles.
[02:48:35.012 --> 02:48:38.393]  And you listen to that, it sounds like an art type of a country music singer.
[02:48:38.393 --> 02:48:39.313]  Like it's just too good.
[02:48:39.313 --> 02:48:40.674]  Listen to it.
[02:48:40.674 --> 02:48:45.815]  I don't worship the ground you walk on.
[02:48:47.373 --> 02:48:50.775]  I never have, and that's a fact.
[02:48:50.775 --> 02:48:53.677]  And see, you hear old Texas voices like that and it sounds fake.
[02:48:53.677 --> 02:48:55.279]  Except that's what my grandfathers sounded like.
[02:48:55.279 --> 02:49:00.742]  They were gentlemanly, they talked pretty slow, they were nice, and they're gone.
[02:49:00.742 --> 02:49:03.344]  There aren't many more of those left.
[02:49:03.344 --> 02:49:06.226]  I'm more of a sped up, crazy Texan.
[02:49:06.226 --> 02:49:08.728]  Alright, I'm gonna get off the subject.
[02:49:11.243 --> 02:49:14.065]  Let's get serious and get down to brass tacks and what's happening in the world.
[02:49:14.065 --> 02:49:15.846]  I'm going to host some of the next hour at Rogers County.
[02:49:15.846 --> 02:49:16.287]  Get serious.
[02:49:16.287 --> 02:49:22.331]  There's a lot of stuff breaking, but it's like the George Strait song.
[02:49:22.331 --> 02:49:24.132]  I saw God today.
[02:49:24.132 --> 02:49:29.136]  I had just a real refilling of the Holy Spirit this morning.
[02:49:29.136 --> 02:49:30.977]  The best I've ever had.
[02:49:30.977 --> 02:49:35.561]  And not the type of you're crying on your knees, the type of like, here's the big plan, buddy.
[02:49:35.561 --> 02:49:37.522]  And just like a big warm blanket, we're going to win.
[02:49:39.701 --> 02:49:40.301]  You know what I mean?
[02:49:40.301 --> 02:49:42.682]  Talk about being a drug addict.
[02:49:42.682 --> 02:49:43.923]  People haven't been around God.
[02:49:43.923 --> 02:49:46.143]  You ain't been around nothing.
[02:49:46.143 --> 02:49:49.845]  Because once you get close to God, all you want to do is get closer to God.
[02:49:49.845 --> 02:49:53.766]  And if you even think about bad stuff, you feel yourself getting pulled away from God.
[02:49:53.766 --> 02:49:54.927]  That's called fearing God.
[02:49:54.927 --> 02:49:57.428]  You're not fearing God's going to do something to you.
[02:49:57.428 --> 02:49:59.928]  You're fearing separation from God.
[02:49:59.928 --> 02:50:03.930]  But see, the profane don't know what they're reading in the Bible.
[02:50:03.930 --> 02:50:06.671]  You have to experience it to then know how profound it is.
[02:50:08.447 --> 02:50:11.288]  Hell is separation from God.
[02:50:11.288 --> 02:50:13.488]  Death is separation from God.
[02:50:13.488 --> 02:50:18.669]  God, the big G. You wanna know what came before all this?
[02:50:18.669 --> 02:50:22.390]  Only God knows.
[02:50:22.390 --> 02:50:25.531]  When all the secrets came out of here, God's mind.
[02:50:25.531 --> 02:50:29.692]  We're a dream of God.
[02:50:29.692 --> 02:50:32.972]  God dreams to build new universes.
[02:50:32.972 --> 02:50:36.253]  God dreams to have more great experiences.
[02:50:37.907 --> 02:50:49.974]  And to see us transcend the fallen and create new worlds.
[02:50:49.974 --> 02:50:51.134]  Not just explore new worlds.
[02:50:51.134 --> 02:50:53.535]  We are master builders.
[02:50:53.535 --> 02:50:55.076]  Great architects.
[02:50:55.076 --> 02:50:57.958]  You know, the Luciferians go, oh, a Luciferian term.
[02:50:57.958 --> 02:50:59.178]  Lucifer is the great architect.
[02:50:59.178 --> 02:51:02.120]  No, God is the architect.
[02:51:02.120 --> 02:51:05.162]  Lucifer can't even read the plans.
[02:51:05.162 --> 02:51:05.522]  We can!
[02:51:06.943 --> 02:51:09.704]  And that's why we're hated by the enemy.
[02:51:09.704 --> 02:51:11.685]  You can read God's language.
[02:51:11.685 --> 02:51:18.447]  You can read master builder plans.
[02:51:18.447 --> 02:51:21.688]  Because you're in the first grade, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:21.688 --> 02:51:22.408]  First grade.
[02:51:22.408 --> 02:51:24.829]  Can you imagine 12th grade?
[02:51:24.829 --> 02:51:26.009]  And then boot camp.
[02:51:26.009 --> 02:51:28.210]  And then you're like, whoa, this is what we're doing.
[02:51:28.210 --> 02:51:31.771]  Get in the fight, let's go!
[02:51:31.771 --> 02:51:35.753]  But a boot camp like this, it might take a hundred million years, a hundred billion years.
[02:51:35.753 --> 02:51:36.233]  We don't know.
[02:51:37.492 --> 02:51:38.233]  I want to know.
[02:51:38.233 --> 02:51:41.596]  I want to be there with the awesome creator of all this.
[02:51:41.596 --> 02:51:47.020]  And I'll do whatever it takes, as weak as I am, to get over that finish line.
[02:51:47.020 --> 02:51:53.206]  If that means I'm tied up one day with those gloveless pulling my guts out of my rear end, their favorite thing, then knock it out, baby!
[02:51:53.206 --> 02:51:53.766]  Knock it out!
[02:51:53.766 --> 02:51:55.027]  Let's go!
[02:51:55.027 --> 02:51:56.629]  Let's get it going here!
[02:51:56.629 --> 02:52:00.492]  Because you're going to go to your God, I'm going to go to mine.
[02:52:00.492 --> 02:52:01.192]  Know that forever.
[02:52:04.482 --> 02:52:06.243]  Let's get back to the sellouts.
[02:52:06.243 --> 02:52:11.526]  Let's get back to the people that collaborate with the devil, the Washington Post.
[02:52:11.526 --> 02:52:15.509]  Here they are sniveling, so tone deaf, whoever the sniveler is.
[02:52:15.509 --> 02:52:19.931]  Do you have that article about the Washington Post?
[02:52:19.931 --> 02:52:21.792]  Here's the Washington Post sniveling.
[02:52:21.792 --> 02:52:25.435]  The headline is, a case for banning Alex Jones.
[02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:25.775]  Here it is.
[02:52:26.937 --> 02:52:29.018]  But he's a chaos candidate.
[02:52:29.018 --> 02:52:31.999]  And he'd be a chaos president.
[02:52:31.999 --> 02:52:40.343]  In December 2015, Donald Trump was leading a very crowded field for the Republican presidential nomination.
[02:52:40.343 --> 02:52:43.244]  Trump agreed to go on to the Alex Jones program.
[02:52:49.087 --> 02:52:50.708]  This is our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:50.708 --> 02:52:52.629]  As you know, I'm leading in every poll.
[02:52:52.629 --> 02:53:13.821]  Trump was able to gain access to the very intense following of Alex Jones' radio program, a group of people who are very cynical about the United States government and might be inclined to support a non-traditional candidate like the new US developer.
[02:53:13.821 --> 02:53:14.181]  Hit pause.
[02:53:14.181 --> 02:53:16.463]  Wow, this reporter is a rocket scientist.
[02:53:17.830 --> 02:53:19.711]  Like, where's the American remnant left?
[02:53:19.711 --> 02:53:33.598]  And Trump comes out of that, his father, a John Bircher, huge funder, Roy Cohn, the Un-American Activities Architect, who the left lies about and says he's a demon all day, like they do me.
[02:53:33.598 --> 02:53:42.783]  And they're acting like Trump came as a chameleon to InfoWars to, like, act like he was InfoWars before I was born.
[02:53:44.895 --> 02:53:46.437]  Planning this the whole time.
[02:53:46.437 --> 02:53:48.180]  He's not back down, he's our champion.
[02:53:48.180 --> 02:53:51.084]  That's why all day they tell you he's failing, he's failing, he's failing.
[02:53:51.084 --> 02:53:53.368]  If you just join us, there'll be no censorship.
[02:53:53.368 --> 02:53:56.793]  We'll love you, just betray Trump.
[02:53:56.793 --> 02:53:58.014]  Fat chance.
[02:53:58.014 --> 02:53:58.776]  Let's go back to Trump.
[02:53:59.735 --> 02:54:00.815]  Donald Trump, let me say this.
[02:54:00.815 --> 02:54:03.816]  My audience, I'd say 90% supports you.
[02:54:03.816 --> 02:54:08.917]  Alex Jones, he is this amazing showman.
[02:54:08.917 --> 02:54:10.257]  They hate you!
[02:54:10.257 --> 02:54:11.598]  They hate prosperity!
[02:54:11.598 --> 02:54:12.838]  They hate God!
[02:54:12.838 --> 02:54:13.858]  They hate children!
[02:54:13.858 --> 02:54:15.719]  And God damn them to hell!
[02:54:15.719 --> 02:54:16.699]  He cries.
[02:54:16.699 --> 02:54:17.699]  He yells.
[02:54:17.699 --> 02:54:20.040]  He growls.
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:22.060]  That was totally real when I talked about that.
[02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:26.501]  We're talking about stories about pedophile networks raping and killing kids.
[02:54:26.501 --> 02:54:27.902]  Oh, he's a showman.
[02:54:27.902 --> 02:54:29.022]  All this other crap.
[02:54:29.989 --> 02:54:32.312]  A showman?
[02:54:32.312 --> 02:54:38.201]  I'm just up here being real, but again, this is, and then they get to, the piece is called The Case for Banning Alex Jones.
[02:54:38.201 --> 02:54:39.182]  He's a showman.
[02:54:39.182 --> 02:54:39.903]  He's effective.
[02:54:39.903 --> 02:54:44.109]  See, it's not that I'm hurting Sandy Hook kids, or I'm, no, no, being a little honest here.
[02:54:44.109 --> 02:54:45.591]  No, he's just too effective.
[02:54:45.591 --> 02:54:45.912]  Continue.
[02:54:48.232 --> 02:54:55.755]  He cries, he yells, he growls, he has this incredible gravelly voice.
[02:54:55.755 --> 02:55:09.161]  He's a quite arresting media figure and he is thumbing his nose at the mainstream media which he considers to be pawns of a global elite that he's very suspicious of and that he suspects...
[02:55:09.941 --> 02:55:22.087]  I'm very suspicious of the global elite that funded the Arab Spring to overthrow four different moderate governments that have women going to college at no burqas and then blows their heads off and puts them in sex slavery.
[02:55:22.087 --> 02:55:25.729]  And there's like five Netflix shows about how great pedophilia is.
[02:55:25.729 --> 02:55:27.690]  I mean, you people!
[02:55:27.690 --> 02:55:28.450]  Suspicious!
[02:55:28.450 --> 02:55:32.012]  I'm not suspicious!
[02:55:32.012 --> 02:55:33.273]  You're the frickin' plague!
[02:55:34.754 --> 02:55:37.735]  And Jeff Bezos is such a nerd in these text messages.
[02:55:37.735 --> 02:55:42.996]  You know, Trump did a tweet and said, I'm so sorry your company's going to get broken up now that your wife knows you're cheating.
[02:55:42.996 --> 02:55:50.377]  The lender who was involved, oh, I'm sure, I'm sure the inquirer just got the text messages without anybody else's help.
[02:55:50.377 --> 02:56:00.519]  And the whole point is, is that Bezos is in there fawning over Bono, who steals 99% of the money he raises for Africans on record, and is proud of it.
[02:56:00.519 --> 02:56:02.480]  And these old, weird, crazy nerds.
[02:56:03.373 --> 02:56:07.635]  They're super old, cool people, too, but, like, nothing about a leftist old person.
[02:56:07.635 --> 02:56:11.636]  He, like, brags to his girlfriend how he knows Bono.
[02:56:11.636 --> 02:56:14.878]  Bono hasn't been cool in 30 years.
[02:56:14.878 --> 02:56:19.780]  Bono is a horrible, pink, sunglass-wearing, turd-basket.
[02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:23.942]  But that just shows how do—this guy's worth $140 billion, and he thinks Bono is cool.
[02:56:27.705 --> 02:56:30.472]  A snake-like jerk!
[02:56:30.472 --> 02:56:33.660]  A pro-abortion piece of filth!
[02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:34.201]  Go back to it.
[02:56:35.319 --> 02:56:36.700]  World domination.
[02:56:36.700 --> 02:56:38.522]  I'll give Obama this, he's bold.
[02:56:38.522 --> 02:56:42.465]  I could never have imagined an Islamic radical sleeper cell becoming president.
[02:56:42.465 --> 02:56:45.047]  I mean, I can't believe the CIA did this.
[02:56:45.047 --> 02:56:53.353]  In the process of making these allegations, he has thrown out some pretty remarkable claims.
[02:56:53.353 --> 02:56:57.257]  We have footage of the police saying, get back, they're going to blow up 7.
[02:56:57.257 --> 02:56:58.498]  It was all over the news that day.
[02:56:58.498 --> 02:57:00.399]  I heard it on CBS radio.
[02:57:00.399 --> 02:57:02.541]  We know they staged stuff, they've staged it before.
[02:57:03.775 --> 02:57:06.518]  And we know they were set and ready with that tragedy.
[02:57:06.518 --> 02:57:14.548]  The Boston bombing, that was a total drill, on record, with the older brother, Tamerlan, being a CIA asset, on record.
[02:57:14.548 --> 02:57:17.791]  And again, you look at the Aurora shooting, that was totally staged.
[02:57:17.791 --> 02:57:19.153]  We're gonna come back with more of this.
[02:57:20.334 --> 02:57:21.474]  And again, I stand by all this.
[02:57:21.474 --> 02:57:22.615]  The Aurora was totally staged.
[02:57:22.615 --> 02:57:23.995]  That came out in the local news.
[02:57:23.995 --> 02:57:27.076]  The Czarneb brothers were CIA cutouts.
[02:57:27.076 --> 02:57:28.737]  Doesn't mean Islamic terror isn't real.
[02:57:28.737 --> 02:57:31.197]  The point is, they said there was a drill that day.
[02:57:31.197 --> 02:57:33.798]  I've got the clips of the news saying they blew up seven.
[02:57:33.798 --> 02:57:35.018]  Everybody's seen them!
[02:57:35.018 --> 02:57:36.919]  How the hell am I a liar?
[02:57:36.919 --> 02:57:38.059]  Fourth Hour straight ahead.
[02:57:38.059 --> 02:57:39.120]  Roger Stone and more.
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:41.800]  And my big statement on Roku that I taped this morning.
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:42.661]  It's about to premiere.
[02:57:42.661 --> 02:57:43.121]  Straight ahead.

[02:58:53.615 --> 02:58:54.096]  It's you!
[02:58:55.182 --> 02:58:57.384]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:58:57.384 --> 02:59:06.072]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:59:06.072 --> 02:59:10.676]  And that's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:59:10.676 --> 02:59:12.137]  You are the info war.
[02:59:12.137 --> 02:59:15.661]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:16.341 --> 02:59:18.002]  We are the renaissance.
[02:59:18.002 --> 02:59:18.902]  And we are winning.
[02:59:48.661 --> 03:00:04.627]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.627 --> 03:00:13.310]  I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong.
[03:00:16.773 --> 03:00:17.994]  Good point that we should make.
[03:00:17.994 --> 03:00:32.905]  Remember how the Seattle TV station got caught warping the president, turning him into a goblin-like creature, he was even described as goblin-like, and slurring his words and then licking his lips in slow motion in a very discombobulating way.
[03:00:32.905 --> 03:00:35.947]  The fact that they would even try this shows how crazy they are.
[03:00:35.947 --> 03:00:42.432]  But this is what Vic Berger and others do to me in the videos that they're using in the New York Times piece.
[03:00:42.432 --> 03:00:45.314]  They make me red, they slow down my voice, they speed it up,
[03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:49.623]  They do it all to make me look insane.
[03:00:49.623 --> 03:00:51.986]  And oh, but when the New York Times does it, it's okay.
[03:00:53.288 --> 03:00:55.349]  So that's how these guys operate.
[03:00:55.349 --> 03:00:56.509]  Now imagine if I did that.
[03:00:56.509 --> 03:01:02.731]  All we did was blow up the video of Ninja Master Jim Acosta grabbing the mic and karate chopping her arm.
[03:01:02.731 --> 03:01:04.012]  You know, he grabs away and pushes her down.
[03:01:04.012 --> 03:01:04.512]  She's shocked.
[03:01:04.512 --> 03:01:05.512]  It's forceful.
[03:01:05.512 --> 03:01:07.353]  I mean, according to feminists, it was a rape.
[03:01:07.353 --> 03:01:08.894]  He murdered her, according to feminists.
[03:01:08.894 --> 03:01:10.594]  Looking at a woman is murder.
[03:01:10.594 --> 03:01:13.895]  Touching them is damning their soul to hell.
[03:01:13.895 --> 03:01:15.816]  But according to them, he cut her head off.
[03:01:15.816 --> 03:01:18.137]  But as soon as he touches her, it's no big deal.
[03:01:19.028 --> 03:01:22.376]  As soon as he touches her, it's no problem.
[03:01:22.376 --> 03:01:23.739]  And it didn't happen, it's edited video.
[03:01:23.739 --> 03:01:26.987]  But they're the ones actually editing the video and doctoring the video.
[03:01:26.987 --> 03:01:28.230]  Blowing it up is not editing it.
[03:01:28.230 --> 03:01:28.490]  Here it is.
[03:01:31.444 --> 03:01:34.566]  He cries, he yells, he growls.
[03:01:34.566 --> 03:01:37.409]  He has this incredible gravelly voice.
[03:01:37.409 --> 03:01:38.970]  We're gonna beat your ass!
[03:01:38.970 --> 03:01:55.303]  He's a quite arresting media figure and he is thumbing his nose at the mainstream media which he considers to be pawns of a global elite that he's very suspicious of and that he suspects is bent on world domination.
[03:01:55.303 --> 03:01:56.925]  I'll give Obama this, he's bold.
[03:01:57.305 --> 03:02:01.226]  I could never have imagined an Islamic radical sleeper cell becoming president.
[03:02:01.226 --> 03:02:03.826]  I mean, I can't believe the CIA did this.
[03:02:03.826 --> 03:02:12.128]  In the process of making these allegations, he has thrown out some pretty remarkable claims.
[03:02:12.128 --> 03:02:16.009]  We have footage of the police saying, get back, they're going to blow up 7.
[03:02:16.009 --> 03:02:17.249]  It was all over the news that day.
[03:02:17.249 --> 03:02:19.149]  I heard it on CBS radio.
[03:02:19.149 --> 03:02:21.290]  We know they staged stuff, they've staged it before.
[03:02:22.546 --> 03:02:25.308]  And we know they were set and ready with that tragedy.
[03:02:25.308 --> 03:02:33.313]  The Boston bombing, that was a total drill, on record, with the older brother, Tamerlan, being a CIA asset, on record.
[03:02:33.313 --> 03:02:36.596]  And again, you look at the Aurora shooting, that was totally staged.
[03:02:36.596 --> 03:02:45.201]  Roger Stone, who's famous for working with Richard Nixon, persuades Donald Trump to go on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:02:45.201 --> 03:02:49.865]  And he doesn't just go on for a couple of minutes, he's on for a half an hour.
[03:02:49.865 --> 03:02:51.706]  And it's this rambling conversation.
[03:02:51.966 --> 03:02:53.086]  We need surveillance.
[03:02:53.086 --> 03:02:54.607]  We need proper surveillance.
[03:02:54.607 --> 03:02:58.028]  For three years I've been saying hit the oil because ISIS is getting stronger.
[03:02:58.028 --> 03:03:00.869]  We lose with every country and yet we don't get along with any countries.
[03:03:00.869 --> 03:03:02.370]  China is killing us.
[03:03:02.370 --> 03:03:17.555]  There's no doubt that Donald Trump and Alex Jones were mutually beneficial to each other because his audience is specifically the kind of voters that Donald Trump needed and wanted to be talking to.
[03:03:18.922 --> 03:03:27.987]  On the other hand, Alex Jones was able to have a larger platform because of his access to Donald Trump.
[03:03:27.987 --> 03:03:47.597]  Roger Stone thinks that Alex Jones will be very useful in selling the Donald Trump legislative agenda, whatever that ends up being, to a public that is hardwired to be skeptical and disapproving of what happens in Washington, D.C.
[03:03:49.693 --> 03:03:56.056]  And that's somebody telling you the sky's blue.
[03:03:56.056 --> 03:03:59.898]  And it's all from their perspective, like we sociopathically went, oh, you'll be good for me.
[03:03:59.898 --> 03:04:00.598]  I'll be good for you.
[03:04:00.598 --> 03:04:01.999]  No.
[03:04:01.999 --> 03:04:05.841]  I told Roger months before Trump won, I said, he's going to win.
[03:04:05.841 --> 03:04:17.146]  And then I said, all hell's going to break loose because I had personal experiences when I was a kid watching what happened when Reagan left office and George Herbert Walker Bush came into office.
[03:04:19.031 --> 03:04:30.820]  And watching just from some family I knew what happened with with with because let me tell you, Bush was a Democrat and he was trying to get rid of all the Reagan people that were out there.
[03:04:30.820 --> 03:04:32.361]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:04:32.361 --> 03:04:36.664]  And I learned real early who the bad guys were real early.
[03:04:36.664 --> 03:04:38.946]  And I knew that if we took them out,
[03:04:40.049 --> 03:04:44.534]  They were gonna come in like hell against us.
[03:04:44.534 --> 03:04:45.496]  And they did it.
[03:04:45.496 --> 03:04:46.637]  And Roger's a smart guy.
[03:04:46.637 --> 03:04:49.601]  Roger kept saying, oh no, we'll stop them, it'll be great.
[03:04:49.601 --> 03:04:51.743]  I said, brother, the war just started.
[03:04:51.743 --> 03:04:52.764]  We'll talk to Roger in 60 seconds.
[03:04:54.326 --> 03:04:56.647]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:06:32.532 --> 03:06:50.534]  All right, Roger Stone's about to take over, but in this segment and part of the next I want to air a really heartfelt, I want to say off the cuff because I've thought about it a lot, but teleprompter free obviously, report that I put out this morning on Roku banning.
[03:06:52.000 --> 03:07:02.413]  And you know, I'm not really strategic, but we created a really primitive app that was halfway broken, or page, for Roku seven years ago, when it first came out.
[03:07:02.413 --> 03:07:04.735]  And we had over a million viewers a week on average to it.
[03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:10.032]  But during the ban, I just forgot to mention it, or they would have banned it already.
[03:07:10.032 --> 03:07:11.072]  They would have got the brigades.
[03:07:11.072 --> 03:07:16.936]  But then when somebody made a fan app that shot up to the front page, it was so popular, within 24 hours it was banned.
[03:07:16.936 --> 03:07:21.758]  And the hyperventilating about banning us and all of it was just next level.
[03:07:21.758 --> 03:07:25.321]  And really, those Sandy Hook lawyers have gone too far because
[03:07:26.241 --> 03:07:28.623]  They just keep saying I'm sending people to their houses.
[03:07:28.623 --> 03:07:31.165]  They're saying he's currently doing it to Roku.
[03:07:31.165 --> 03:07:32.246]  You've got to take him off.
[03:07:32.246 --> 03:07:34.627]  He's on your platform and sending people to our houses.
[03:07:34.627 --> 03:07:36.068]  That's totally untrue.
[03:07:36.068 --> 03:07:37.510]  I've never said go to their houses.
[03:07:37.510 --> 03:07:39.191]  I'm not saying it now.
[03:07:39.191 --> 03:07:44.154]  I think Sandy Hook happened and I just already knew it but it hit me this morning and last night.
[03:07:44.154 --> 03:07:47.817]  My identity has been stolen.
[03:07:47.817 --> 03:07:52.561]  And for years I've said stop saying that I don't say that people died and they won't shut up.
[03:07:52.561 --> 03:07:55.243]  They won't stop doing it in my name.
[03:07:55.243 --> 03:07:55.363]  So
[03:07:58.240 --> 03:08:02.702]  I'm gonna get, let me tell you, I've not been to Newtown, I'm coming.
[03:08:02.702 --> 03:08:05.943]  And I've not, I've not, I mean, it's on now.
[03:08:05.943 --> 03:08:13.887]  So, I've been so busy and stuff with other issues, but I realize they are literally trying to make me the Sandy Hook man, when it wasn't one-tenth of one percent of what I covered.
[03:08:13.887 --> 03:08:17.889]  But hey, don't worry, you're gonna get what you want now.
[03:08:17.889 --> 03:08:20.570]  With the whole nine yards, baby.
[03:08:20.570 --> 03:08:23.771]  And don't worry, everything accredited, everything licensed.
[03:08:23.771 --> 03:08:25.812]  Everything licensed.
[03:08:25.812 --> 03:08:26.853]  Not gonna be harassing anybody.
[03:08:27.796 --> 03:08:33.717]  But you wanna stick a magnifying glass down my throat or up my ass?
[03:08:33.717 --> 03:08:35.258]  Okay.
[03:08:35.258 --> 03:08:36.358]  Two-way streets.
[03:08:36.358 --> 03:08:37.438]  Two-way streets.
[03:08:37.438 --> 03:08:42.179]  So, everybody knows I'm a loving, sweet person.
[03:08:42.179 --> 03:08:54.301]  And all I know is that I am not gonna, in my life, have all the work we've done for America and freedom be turned into something about Sandy Hook when it's not my identity.
[03:08:54.301 --> 03:08:56.802]  I realize now this is my identity being stolen!
[03:08:58.200 --> 03:09:03.821]  I don't know how I've been so dumb to understand it, but it's like just reading this and watching this.
[03:09:03.821 --> 03:09:27.425]  Roger Stone, so much is going on, so much is happening, but Trump and the censorship thing, as you've said, this is the hill he lives or dies on, and now they are going after everybody in high gear, and he's put in William Barr, who, you know, best friends with Mueller, and they're in the same damn church together, and their wives are in the same Bible study with Baphomet.
[03:09:29.318 --> 03:09:31.099]  You know, I love Trump and I know he's a good guy.
[03:09:31.099 --> 03:09:41.423]  He does a lot of good things, but when it comes to personnel, I mean, he might as well just hire Satan or maybe... I mean, I know these guys lie to him and say, we're going to be good.
[03:09:41.423 --> 03:09:46.885]  And, you know, I know Barr wrote some stuff about the unitary executive, but what the hell is going on here?
[03:09:49.201 --> 03:09:52.326]  It's very, very hard to know, Alex.
[03:09:52.326 --> 03:09:55.090]  I mean, I think first of all, you're absolutely right.
[03:09:55.090 --> 03:09:58.375]  I want to vouch for your version of events here.
[03:09:58.375 --> 03:10:03.523]  I can't forget election night because, of course, I was exhausted, but euphoric.
[03:10:04.586 --> 03:10:07.389]  And so was everybody on the InfoWars crew.
[03:10:07.389 --> 03:10:14.938]  We had worked very hard on providing excellent coverage on election night, and you seem kind of dejected and down.
[03:10:14.938 --> 03:10:16.420]  And I said to you, what's the matter?
[03:10:16.420 --> 03:10:18.101]  Why aren't you savoring this moment?
[03:10:18.101 --> 03:10:19.523]  And you said, you don't understand.
[03:10:19.523 --> 03:10:22.126]  This is not the end.
[03:10:22.126 --> 03:10:23.828]  This is just the beginning.
[03:10:24.740 --> 03:10:27.761]  They're never going to let us have it without a fight.
[03:10:27.761 --> 03:10:33.423]  They're never going to let, as much as you love Trump, they're never going to let him enact his agenda.
[03:10:33.423 --> 03:10:35.203]  We're in for the fight of our lives.
[03:10:35.203 --> 03:10:40.545]  And of course, I thought you were wrong and you turned out to be absolutely right.
[03:10:41.760 --> 03:10:48.866]  The video you showed from the Washington Post with that guy, Manuel Roig-Franza, who I know very well.
[03:10:48.866 --> 03:10:51.268]  He's a great guy to have a beer with.
[03:10:51.268 --> 03:10:54.431]  He doesn't burp without checking with Langley.
[03:10:54.431 --> 03:11:05.660]  I mean, recognize the Washington Post has been a wholly owned subsidiary, indeed the mouthpiece, the official organ of the Central Intelligence Agency since the late 50s.
[03:11:05.660 --> 03:11:10.824]  After John F. Kennedy was murdered, former President Harry Truman, the last
[03:11:11.642 --> 03:11:26.242]  After Jack Kennedy, the previous American president, Democrat, staunch anti-communist, a believer in America, wrote an op-ed piece saying that signing the CIA into the law was the greatest single mistake that he made.
[03:11:27.068 --> 03:11:34.533]  President Truman's op-ed ran for one edition before they spiked it at the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:11:34.533 --> 03:11:35.774]  And let's be clear.
[03:11:35.774 --> 03:11:37.776]  He said it's a legacy of ashes.
[03:11:37.776 --> 03:11:39.757]  It should be torn into a thousand pieces.
[03:11:39.757 --> 03:11:41.338]  And let's expand on it.
[03:11:41.338 --> 03:11:44.040]  Create a rogue group similar to the FBI leadership.
[03:11:44.040 --> 03:11:46.782]  Not the whole FBI, but the FBI leadership.
[03:11:46.782 --> 03:11:50.124]  And again, we don't say the FBI has good people in it to kiss their butt.
[03:11:50.124 --> 03:11:52.706]  There are a lot of good people in there, but the top are bad folks.
[03:11:52.706 --> 03:11:54.307]  Just like the CIA is a bunch of different groups.
[03:11:55.788 --> 03:11:58.650]  They're completely out of control, and what you just said is true.
[03:11:58.650 --> 03:12:03.954]  Bezos got $600 million when he bought it from the CIA to co-locate.
[03:12:03.954 --> 03:12:07.076]  Most of the people there are actual operatives and spies.
[03:12:07.076 --> 03:12:11.079]  The New York Times is a bunch of leftist foundations that even sit above that for policy.
[03:12:11.519 --> 03:12:13.041]  That's why they're the policemen of the internet now.
[03:12:13.041 --> 03:12:14.123]  It's come out in Project Veritas.
[03:12:14.123 --> 03:12:19.671]  So when you say they're the CIA, they are the CIA on congressional record.
[03:12:19.671 --> 03:12:21.033]  And they've been paid.
[03:12:21.033 --> 03:12:26.561]  Bezos was given money back in a government contract just to be the front man to own it for the CIA.
[03:12:28.143 --> 03:12:38.066]  Yeah, so the notion that these are free media outlets exercising the First Amendment and that they're free of governmental influence is completely false.
[03:12:38.066 --> 03:12:40.327]  They are totally controlled.
[03:12:40.327 --> 03:12:43.147]  Nothing appears in the pages of the Washington Post.
[03:12:43.147 --> 03:12:47.509]  It hasn't been pre-approved out at Langley at the CIA headquarters.
[03:12:47.509 --> 03:12:50.890]  I know people say, oh, Stone, Jones, you're just conspiracy theorists.
[03:12:50.890 --> 03:12:51.690]  Oh, let me go further.
[03:12:51.690 --> 03:12:54.431]  I mean, I have some high-level former and current CIA people.
[03:12:55.296 --> 03:12:59.799]  Actually, three of them total, who were saying, oh yeah, Trump's great, yeah, great, blah, blah, blah.
[03:12:59.799 --> 03:13:01.920]  There's good people at the CIA, they like what you're doing.
[03:13:01.920 --> 03:13:06.403]  But a couple months ago, I started getting threatened and, hey, you better go against Trump or we're not going to talk to you anymore.
[03:13:06.403 --> 03:13:08.364]  And so, no, your wimps is what you are.
[03:13:08.364 --> 03:13:11.306]  They stick their finger up when the chai comms are selling the country out.
[03:13:11.306 --> 03:13:14.107]  They go, if he might go down, we better turn against him.
[03:13:14.107 --> 03:13:15.048]  You're not Americans.
[03:13:15.048 --> 03:13:15.828]  You're cowards.
[03:13:15.828 --> 03:13:16.729]  You're not even thugs.
[03:13:16.729 --> 03:13:17.890]  You're not even gangsters.
[03:13:17.890 --> 03:13:19.791]  You're punk little boys.
[03:13:20.916 --> 03:13:27.501]  You know, Alex, I've got to tell you, in the 50 plus years I've been in American politics, I've really never seen anything like this moment.
[03:13:49.514 --> 03:13:58.000]  It's almost like the New York Times story, which revealed, with some excellent reporting, that in the wake of Donald Trump's firing of James Comey,
[03:13:58.655 --> 03:14:10.819]  Who had willfully covered up the criminality of Hillary Clinton and the breaches of national security involved in her use of a secret, illegal email server.
[03:14:10.819 --> 03:14:20.722]  They have fomented a greater torrent, a greater tsunami of fake news in the last 72 hours than anything I have seen in the 50 plus years I've been in America.
[03:14:20.722 --> 03:14:23.883]  And that means one of two things, but I think it's both co-equal.
[03:14:23.883 --> 03:14:25.424]  They're going on a major offensive.
[03:14:26.164 --> 03:14:35.934]  Out of desperation that Trump is moving with the grand juries, which QAnon didn't crap out of its rear end, which are confirmed now against McCabe and others.
[03:14:35.934 --> 03:14:37.396]  I think that's what this is.
[03:14:37.396 --> 03:14:38.958]  Total desperation, last moves.
[03:14:40.117 --> 03:14:43.300]  Well, the whole new narrative is beyond belief.
[03:14:43.300 --> 03:14:45.522]  Trump is a Russian agent.
[03:14:45.522 --> 03:14:47.663]  Trump works for Putin.
[03:14:47.663 --> 03:14:50.746]  Trump is Putin's puppet.
[03:14:50.746 --> 03:14:51.607]  With no proof!
[03:14:51.607 --> 03:14:52.167]  Oh, look!
[03:14:52.167 --> 03:14:53.328]  He's on the news!
[03:14:53.328 --> 03:14:54.969]  He was at a press conference with Putin!
[03:14:54.969 --> 03:14:56.651]  My God, he's standing next to him!
[03:14:58.036 --> 03:15:05.879]  My wife this morning, going through her Facebook page, says, oh, there's a new report out that says Donald Trump works for the Russians.
[03:15:05.879 --> 03:15:06.819]  I said, honey, let me look.
[03:15:06.819 --> 03:15:07.500]  Who's saying that?
[03:15:07.500 --> 03:15:08.720]  Let me look at that.
[03:15:08.720 --> 03:15:10.861]  It's some left-wing think tank.
[03:15:10.861 --> 03:15:12.282]  Think progress.
[03:15:12.282 --> 03:15:14.162]  They have no credibility, literally.
[03:15:14.162 --> 03:15:15.083]  And let's go further.
[03:15:15.083 --> 03:15:19.925]  Your wife is a famous daughter of a Cuban revolutionary that tried to stop Castro.
[03:15:19.925 --> 03:15:23.266]  You're there in the middle of the Cuban community, obviously CIA, the whole thing.
[03:15:24.927 --> 03:15:31.372]  The right-wing CIA, and he's even looking at the paper, you know, just believing it, because how would the paper say he's a Russian agent?
[03:15:31.372 --> 03:15:33.914]  It's so outrageous, because they don't get in trouble!
[03:15:33.914 --> 03:15:37.837]  You're sitting right there in the middle of right-wing world!
[03:15:37.837 --> 03:15:39.398]  Or am I wrong?
[03:15:39.398 --> 03:15:40.579]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:16:23.050 --> 03:16:29.395]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.395 --> 03:16:32.437]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.437 --> 03:16:38.362]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.362 --> 03:16:42.145]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.145 --> 03:16:43.426]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.426 --> 03:16:44.767]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.767 --> 03:16:50.972]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.972 --> 03:16:52.393]  Available at Amazon Books.

[03:19:02.374 --> 03:19:03.836]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:03.836 --> 03:19:08.542]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[03:19:57.709 --> 03:20:00.331]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.824 --> 03:20:19.929]  I listen to this this morning driving into work.
[03:20:19.929 --> 03:20:25.415]  It made me feel so good.
[03:20:25.415 --> 03:20:31.981]  And it's not even about the song, him trying to get this woman to love him more than she loved her old boyfriend.
[03:20:31.981 --> 03:20:34.384]  It's just the way it's about love.
[03:20:37.439 --> 03:20:38.600]  That hand is stretched out.
[03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:45.305]  It's like God offers us everything wholesome and good, and all we gotta do is take it.
[03:20:45.305 --> 03:20:47.246]  It's free will.
[03:20:47.246 --> 03:20:56.513]  I don't think it'll translate well on AM radio or whatever, but listen to some Keith Whitley, folks.
[03:20:56.513 --> 03:20:57.394]  Listen to a minute of this.
[03:21:07.181 --> 03:21:11.366]  It's a Yoshi Fonzy Whitley song.
[03:21:11.366 --> 03:21:13.408]  This amazing mullet.
[03:21:27.912 --> 03:21:36.461]  The funny thing is, Keith Whitley, I swear, I listened to him a lot when I was in high school and later and I forgot about him and I started listening to him again.
[03:21:36.461 --> 03:21:38.644]  It's the only music that gets stuck in my head.
[03:21:38.644 --> 03:21:40.246]  Listen to this part right here.
[03:21:57.121 --> 03:21:58.963]  Look at Roger being all serious.
[03:21:58.963 --> 03:22:00.564]  He's got such big stuff to talk about.
[03:22:00.564 --> 03:22:02.565]  Trying to put him in prison.
[03:22:02.565 --> 03:22:04.407]  Total battle for America.
[03:22:04.407 --> 03:22:06.828]  And I'm playing Keith Whitley songs.
[03:22:06.828 --> 03:22:13.754]  Listen to this quote.
[03:22:13.754 --> 03:22:18.297]  But you know like Keith Whitley and George Floyd are the Alex Jones secret weapon.
[03:22:18.297 --> 03:22:21.940]  That's what I listen to when I'm down.
[03:22:21.940 --> 03:22:24.682]  Today the tyrant rules not by club or fist.
[03:22:26.493 --> 03:22:34.781]  But disguised as market research, he shepherds his flocks in the ways of utility and comfort.
[03:22:34.781 --> 03:22:38.924]  Marshall McLuhan.
[03:22:38.924 --> 03:22:40.085]  Marshall McLuhan.
[03:22:40.085 --> 03:22:42.287]  Make art is how you counter the system.
[03:22:42.287 --> 03:22:46.651]  Hey, Roger, you know, I probably won't even get to this whole thing next time because you're hosting the show.
[03:22:46.651 --> 03:22:47.292]  I appreciate that.
[03:22:47.292 --> 03:22:48.313]  You're doing a great job.
[03:22:48.313 --> 03:22:49.814]  More room to come up with Owen Schroeder later.
[03:22:51.192 --> 03:22:54.993]  Let's get right down to brass tacks as Keith Whitley introduced us here.
[03:22:54.993 --> 03:22:56.254]  Don't close your eyes.
[03:22:56.254 --> 03:22:58.454]  We need to face what we're dealing with here.
[03:22:58.454 --> 03:23:01.415]  Clearly, we're not waiting for an offensive.
[03:23:01.415 --> 03:23:03.516]  The left has launched their final offensive.
[03:23:03.516 --> 03:23:05.837]  They found nothing in Russiagate.
[03:23:05.837 --> 03:23:07.137]  And when I say this, this isn't hype.
[03:23:07.137 --> 03:23:08.618]  I say what's true.
[03:23:08.618 --> 03:23:09.458]  There was nothing.
[03:23:09.458 --> 03:23:10.499]  They admit that.
[03:23:10.499 --> 03:23:12.239]  And so it's total Russian proof!
[03:23:12.239 --> 03:23:13.540]  Oh my God, Robert Ailes!
[03:23:13.540 --> 03:23:14.420]  Good Lord!
[03:23:14.420 --> 03:23:17.581]  With nothing in the articles, just the headlines.
[03:23:17.581 --> 03:23:20.322]  And so what do they think this total fake push does?
[03:23:22.045 --> 03:23:31.472]  Trying to intimidate his cabinet to go for the removal via the amendment, which you said they'd do two years ago.
[03:23:31.472 --> 03:23:40.459]  I think we're here, because behind the scenes, the harassment of his supporters and his base and his stalwarts and his knights of the roundtable has gone into high gear.
[03:23:40.459 --> 03:23:42.901]  So I think we, I just asked the question, I think you're going to agree.
[03:23:42.901 --> 03:23:46.124]  We're in the middle of an active coup against the president.
[03:23:46.124 --> 03:23:47.004]  A, is that true?
[03:23:47.004 --> 03:23:48.185]  B, is that wrong?
[03:23:48.185 --> 03:23:50.127]  And C, what do we do about it?
[03:23:51.943 --> 03:23:56.506]  Well, first of all, Alex, let me say that I think it's absolutely correct.
[03:23:56.506 --> 03:23:58.708]  We are entering the endgame now.
[03:23:58.708 --> 03:23:59.929]  This is it.
[03:23:59.929 --> 03:24:02.211]  They have clearly made their move.
[03:24:02.211 --> 03:24:14.320]  Winning the House of Representatives in a fraudulent election for the Democrats was the final piece of the puzzle that they needed in their effort to remove the duly elected president.
[03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:16.762]  Here's where they make their strategic mistake, Alex.
[03:24:17.797 --> 03:24:21.359]  They believe that we are like them.
[03:24:21.359 --> 03:24:25.720]  In other words, they think we're in this for money and power.
[03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:30.022]  They think that we are soulless like them.
[03:24:30.022 --> 03:24:38.185]  For me, this is about my children, my grandchildren, my godson, Carter Stone Davis.
[03:24:38.185 --> 03:24:46.689]  I want them to have the same level of freedom and opportunity, the same ability to worship the God they choose that I had.
[03:24:47.809 --> 03:24:50.252]  And that's why this is a fight to the death.
[03:24:50.252 --> 03:24:52.974]  You can offer us millions of dollars.
[03:24:52.974 --> 03:24:54.656]  We won't take it.
[03:24:54.656 --> 03:24:56.778]  You can squeeze me as they have.
[03:24:56.778 --> 03:25:00.021]  I've lost my health insurance, my life insurance.
[03:25:00.021 --> 03:25:01.843]  I've got to scramble to pay rent.
[03:25:01.843 --> 03:25:10.912]  No, I'm not wealthy because they want to squeeze me financially to see if they can make me make up stories Michael Cohn style against Donald Trump.
[03:25:11.432 --> 03:25:17.836]  Or maybe give them something on Alex Jones that's not true, since it's well known that you're a Russian spy.
[03:25:17.836 --> 03:25:20.939]  And what they don't understand is we're never going to do it.
[03:25:20.939 --> 03:25:30.765]  That the harder you kick us, the more you try to censor us, the more you try to defame us, the harder we're going to fight, because we're not in it for the money.
[03:25:41.332 --> 03:25:43.773]  I mean, you know, I'm pretty manly.
[03:25:43.773 --> 03:25:46.914]  I think especially my dad's dad was like even way more manly than I am.
[03:25:46.914 --> 03:25:50.115]  Like, I don't really see people out there as manly like that.
[03:25:50.115 --> 03:25:50.995]  He wasn't trying to be manly.
[03:25:50.995 --> 03:25:52.495]  He was, he was a man.
[03:25:52.495 --> 03:25:54.636]  He would not put up with any of this crap.
[03:25:54.636 --> 03:25:58.077]  And I don't get, like, you would try to intimidate somebody like that, they'd kill you.
[03:25:58.077 --> 03:26:04.479]  And I just don't get where we lost that instinct to not be run over.
[03:26:04.479 --> 03:26:08.040]  The single most important thing involved here.
[03:26:08.977 --> 03:26:10.982]  is their ability to silence us.
[03:26:10.982 --> 03:26:20.301]  You see, they cannot pull off this silent coup without this insidious and ruthless and relentless campaign of internet censorship.
[03:26:21.036 --> 03:26:29.340]  They've got to close Infowars down, because we play the same role that Paul Revere played in the American Revolution.
[03:26:29.340 --> 03:26:39.345]  We're getting to the people first with the truth, and the truth is like the light that makes these cockroaches run, and therefore they have no higher goal.
[03:26:40.163 --> 03:26:54.988]  Then to silence you, silence me, knock InfoWars off of every conceivable social network, eventually try to go after our URL to make us non-people, to literally just make us disappear.
[03:26:54.988 --> 03:27:07.632]  And if anyone doesn't understand that you, Alex, are the test case, if they get you, if they get InfoWars, if they get me, Sean Hannity's right behind.
[03:27:08.467 --> 03:27:09.128]  Tucker Carlson.
[03:27:09.128 --> 03:27:11.410]  By the way, I know you know a lot of inside baseball at Fox.
[03:27:11.410 --> 03:27:13.532]  I've been talking to a lot of high-level people.
[03:27:13.532 --> 03:27:19.498]  Hannity, as you were told about a year ago, but I was completely... Lately, they've been calling him in, threatening him, saying, you're gone.
[03:27:19.498 --> 03:27:21.360]  We're going to destroy you after you're gone.
[03:27:21.360 --> 03:27:22.841]  There's no Derling, he's a Boy Scout.
[03:27:23.602 --> 03:27:26.286]  And he didn't used to be, you know, he's a Boy Scout.
[03:27:26.286 --> 03:27:28.389]  He couldn't believe all this stuff was, you know, real.
[03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:29.471]  He's really grown up a lot.
[03:27:29.471 --> 03:27:31.314]  I don't mean that condescendingly.
[03:27:31.314 --> 03:27:34.038]  It's good to be a Boy Scout, but you have a blind spot when you are.
[03:27:34.038 --> 03:27:37.864]  He is saying there's an active coup and he is being threatened every day right now.
[03:27:37.864 --> 03:27:38.685]  So he's a really good guy.
[03:27:40.089 --> 03:27:41.371]  There's no question.
[03:27:41.371 --> 03:27:44.075]  There's a handful of patriots there.
[03:27:44.075 --> 03:27:48.501]  Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity.
[03:27:48.501 --> 03:27:49.983]  They're not long for this world.
[03:27:49.983 --> 03:27:54.390]  Oh, Ingraham just lost her top-rated show because she can't get any damn sponsors.
[03:27:54.390 --> 03:27:55.772]  And all these conservative companies
[03:27:56.192 --> 03:27:57.813]  Won't go do it because they're wimps.
[03:27:57.813 --> 03:27:59.635]  You're going to lose it all, boys!
[03:27:59.635 --> 03:28:06.259]  Your golf course, your mistress, all your jack crap, your private jet, because you didn't bet on America.
[03:28:06.259 --> 03:28:13.064]  That's what makes me sick, is so many of these guys have money, they say they're conservatives, and they won't, oh, I don't want to be on Laura Ingraham now.
[03:28:13.064 --> 03:28:16.126]  Take an opportunity of someone being boycotted, you get cheaper advertising.
[03:28:16.126 --> 03:28:18.428]  They don't have that instinct, Roger.
[03:28:18.428 --> 03:28:19.849]  They don't have the grit anymore.
[03:28:20.945 --> 03:28:22.108]  No, it's absolutely true.
[03:28:22.108 --> 03:28:29.625]  As I try to raise money for my legal defense fund, I go to these wealthy conservatives, wealthy Republicans, and they say, oh Roger, I'd like to help you.
[03:28:30.285 --> 03:28:31.586]  But I'm scared.
[03:28:31.586 --> 03:28:33.446]  If I help you, they might investigate me.
[03:28:33.446 --> 03:28:35.267]  Let me tell you what's happened when we come back.
[03:28:35.267 --> 03:28:42.430]  They're living off the fumes of what our forebearers and others in the greatest generation did, and they think conformity is what got them all this.
[03:28:42.430 --> 03:28:43.390]  No.
[03:28:43.390 --> 03:28:47.932]  It was standing up got us all this, and now you pissed it away, you dumb bastards.
[03:28:47.932 --> 03:28:49.292]  You think it's safe to sit it out?
[03:28:49.292 --> 03:28:50.012]  No!
[03:28:50.012 --> 03:28:51.273]  You are the peril!
[03:28:53.183 --> 03:28:56.765]  The pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.765 --> 03:29:00.327]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.327 --> 03:29:02.468]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:31:03.633 --> 03:31:07.134]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.

[03:31:53.579 --> 03:32:02.870]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:05.733]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:05.733 --> 03:32:11.780]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.441 --> 03:32:18.704]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.704 --> 03:32:24.988]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:24.988 --> 03:32:31.931]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.072 --> 03:32:34.693]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:24.424 --> 03:33:51.916]  Amarillo by morning Up from San Antonio Everything that I got Is just what I've got on When that sun is high in that Texas sky I'll be bucking at the county fair Amarillo by morning
[03:33:53.462 --> 03:33:55.403]  I'll be looking for eight.
[03:34:22.276 --> 03:34:31.482]  You know, Roger, I don't want to be too dramatic here, but let's get down to brass tacks.
[03:34:31.482 --> 03:34:34.625]  There's an ongoing coup live against the president right now.
[03:34:34.625 --> 03:34:37.427]  They're attacking every associate that is willing to stand up for the country.
[03:34:40.074 --> 03:34:46.139]  Americans tire of things, and a lot of people are awake, a lot are engaged, but others don't get the main battles now.
[03:34:46.139 --> 03:34:47.220]  It's supposed to happen during elections.
[03:34:47.220 --> 03:34:49.061]  They don't get, this is not an election.
[03:34:49.061 --> 03:34:52.263]  The country's in a fight for its very survival right now.
[03:34:52.263 --> 03:34:58.969]  So I kind of took the show over today, this hour you were going to be hosting, you'll be on the war room coming up in the next three hours with Owen Schroeder and yourself.
[03:34:58.969 --> 03:35:00.590]  But what else is going on?
[03:35:00.590 --> 03:35:02.431]  What else is on the radar screen?
[03:35:02.431 --> 03:35:04.413]  And what do the listeners need to do?
[03:35:04.413 --> 03:35:06.915]  Not like we're bitching at them, but they want to be in the fight.
[03:35:07.936 --> 03:35:14.829]  There's so much they should be doing right now, and so I want to get your perspective on what I should do, what you should do, I mean, what is your gut level on that?
[03:35:15.663 --> 03:35:23.866]  Well, in all honesty, Alex, we began an initiative before Christmas that is still, I think, the component that's key to all of this.
[03:35:23.866 --> 03:35:43.793]  And that is to persuade President Trump to right now direct his Justice Department to initiate antitrust action to stop the racketeering by the Internet tech giants who are trying to strangle not just InfoWars, but every single conservative Republican pro-Trump voice on the Internet.
[03:35:44.333 --> 03:35:45.754]  This is the key to victory.
[03:35:45.754 --> 03:35:49.178]  If we lose this fight, there is no winning.
[03:35:49.178 --> 03:35:53.722]  And therefore, folks who want to help, you can still go to WriteTrump.com.
[03:35:53.722 --> 03:35:57.064]  Sitting in my garage, I have 50,000 letters for President Donald Trump.
[03:36:03.690 --> 03:36:06.252]  I'm waiting until he comes to Palm Beach.
[03:36:06.252 --> 03:36:11.777]  He's been working so hard to break the back of the Democrats on the stand down over the wall.
[03:36:11.777 --> 03:36:25.047]  He has not come to Florida, but I can tell you I'm going to personally deliver your letters to Mar-a-Lago so he can see that the American people support his tweets on this subject, but they want him to take action.
[03:36:25.935 --> 03:36:28.278]  This is not a program we've abandoned, folks.
[03:36:28.278 --> 03:36:31.300]  It's just a program we were forced to put aside.
[03:36:31.300 --> 03:36:34.463]  But right now, there is nothing more important.
[03:36:34.463 --> 03:36:41.089]  Because if they shut Infowars down, America's early warning system is out of commission.
[03:36:41.089 --> 03:36:43.432]  You're not going to be able to find out what's going on.
[03:36:43.432 --> 03:36:47.896]  You're going to hear about the coup as they're leading Donald Trump to the gallows.
[03:36:47.896 --> 03:36:49.237]  And that will be too late.
[03:36:50.087 --> 03:36:52.629]  There is no more important fight now.
[03:36:52.629 --> 03:37:04.679]  The other thing, and you say this every day, Alex, and I repeat it on The War Room, if you see a link of something we do here, InfoWars, NewsWars, The War Room, and it catches your eye, you think it's persuasive and compelling.
[03:37:05.760 --> 03:37:08.781]  Take that link and send it to your friends.
[03:37:08.781 --> 03:37:17.045]  Send it, put it up on your Facebook account, your Twitter account, your Instagram account, your Snapchat account.
[03:37:17.045 --> 03:37:18.146]  Spread the word.
[03:37:18.146 --> 03:37:21.407]  You see, they can shut us down, but they can't shut all of us.
[03:37:21.407 --> 03:37:22.087]  That's right, Roger.
[03:37:22.087 --> 03:37:23.488]  You're hosting the second hour of The War Room.
[03:37:23.488 --> 03:37:25.409]  I'm going to air a special report next segment.
[03:37:25.409 --> 03:37:27.510]  Great job, and thank you, Roger Stone.
[03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:28.590]  Okay.
[03:37:28.590 --> 03:37:30.051]  Thank you.
[03:37:30.051 --> 03:37:32.192]  Speaking of the devil, funding, look.
[03:37:33.752 --> 03:37:45.479]  I go to InfoWars.com, I go to NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and the sites have never had more traffic, because we're banned everywhere else, so traffic's gone up there.
[03:37:45.479 --> 03:37:51.342]  But you'll see Facebook, on average article, 100 shares.
[03:37:51.342 --> 03:37:53.283]  You'll see Twitter, 100 shares, whatever.
[03:37:53.283 --> 03:37:56.425]  We used to have the average article 1,000 shares, 2,000 shares, sometimes 25,000 shares.
[03:37:56.425 --> 03:37:59.066]  I think our record was like 100,000 shares once on a Facebook deal.
[03:38:03.188 --> 03:38:09.753]  People know, oh, if I put out Alex Jones, I'm going to get seven days out of my Facebook where I talk to my grandbabies.
[03:38:09.753 --> 03:38:10.994]  I don't want to do that.
[03:38:10.994 --> 03:38:12.936]  That's fine.
[03:38:12.936 --> 03:38:15.778]  It'll take them a while to demonize News Wars and brand it for banning.
[03:38:15.778 --> 03:38:17.700]  We found people don't get banned.
[03:38:17.700 --> 03:38:19.541]  They don't get blocked for News Wars.
[03:38:19.541 --> 03:38:22.564]  And we're going to start launching new websites every month.
[03:38:22.564 --> 03:38:23.845]  That'll be the new website.
[03:38:23.845 --> 03:38:28.989]  You can promote our syndicated information and not get banned on Twitter or Facebook because they just got, you know,
[03:38:30.697 --> 03:38:42.105]  People that barely speak English in India, great folks, but over there, you know, censoring and kind of brigading leftists, but they're always busy using drugs or not working here in America.
[03:38:42.105 --> 03:38:46.428]  So literally, they don't know which end is up.
[03:38:46.428 --> 03:38:53.733]  And so we're launching in the next few weeks, there'll be new websites every month, and we'll keep the sites going forever too.
[03:38:53.733 --> 03:38:57.376]  We're gonna launch, I plan to launch this year, 20 websites, 30 websites.
[03:38:59.042 --> 03:39:07.127]  We're gonna launch a... Well, we're working with folks that are launching a real social network that'll be free and open.
[03:39:07.127 --> 03:39:08.088]  Wait till you see that.
[03:39:08.088 --> 03:39:09.969]  That's gonna happen in the next few months.
[03:39:09.969 --> 03:39:14.272]  And, you know, they got me behind last year with the demonization, the lawsuits, the lies.
[03:39:14.272 --> 03:39:15.393]  I wanted to hire more people.
[03:39:15.393 --> 03:39:18.515]  I wanted to do more shows.
[03:39:18.515 --> 03:39:21.537]  But a lot of it is you think these personalities... I'm not being mean about it.
[03:39:21.537 --> 03:39:23.218]  It actually scares the hell out of me.
[03:39:23.218 --> 03:39:27.121]  You think a lot of these personalities you see on the Internet that seem together and ready and doing it,
[03:39:30.541 --> 03:39:34.546]  They, on average, there's not a work ethic out there.
[03:39:34.546 --> 03:39:42.676]  Like, the conservative or libertarian or nationalist work ethic is very high compared to leftists, but it's still not an impulse wars work ethic.
[03:39:42.676 --> 03:39:49.745]  And so, I'm trying to build an army, and I'm trying to find the people to get on air.
[03:39:51.172 --> 03:39:55.736]  And it's just not an easy situation, but here's the thing.
[03:39:55.736 --> 03:39:57.177]  I know how metaphysics works.
[03:39:57.177 --> 03:39:59.019]  I know how the universe works.
[03:39:59.019 --> 03:40:02.341]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:40:02.341 --> 03:40:06.565]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:40:06.565 --> 03:40:10.548]  There is no set stasis.
[03:40:10.548 --> 03:40:13.010]  There is no managed system.
[03:40:13.010 --> 03:40:13.390]  There is no
[03:40:15.851 --> 03:40:17.392]  Uncontinuum.
[03:40:17.392 --> 03:40:23.054]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[03:40:23.054 --> 03:40:32.959]  So, I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[03:40:32.959 --> 03:40:35.200]  And that would be a very true statement.
[03:40:35.200 --> 03:40:42.483]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[03:40:42.483 --> 03:40:43.964]  If I fight as hard as I can,
[03:40:45.771 --> 03:40:48.892]  And people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[03:40:48.892 --> 03:40:54.473]  You support us and get creative and get fired up, we won't just be here a hundred years, we'll be here forever.
[03:40:54.473 --> 03:40:56.774]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:40:56.774 --> 03:41:05.457]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what, are gonna look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[03:41:05.457 --> 03:41:10.958]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[03:41:10.958 --> 03:41:13.319]  Like Christ said, I have other flocks.
[03:41:13.319 --> 03:41:13.819]  It's a lot of them.
[03:41:15.031 --> 03:41:15.712]  God's big.
[03:41:15.712 --> 03:41:17.633]  God makes a lot of stuff, you know.
[03:41:17.633 --> 03:41:19.495]  And, you know, I want to be on the winning team.
[03:41:19.495 --> 03:41:21.857]  I want to like, hey, hey, come on in.
[03:41:21.857 --> 03:41:22.637]  You made it.
[03:41:22.637 --> 03:41:25.079]  Good to have you here.
[03:41:25.079 --> 03:41:27.801]  Cash, you were infested by the child raping demons.
[03:41:27.801 --> 03:41:29.143]  You ought to see what we had to go through.
[03:41:29.143 --> 03:41:30.724]  But thank God we're moving forward now.
[03:41:30.724 --> 03:41:34.647]  We got some big challenges, though, because we got these guys to deal with.
[03:41:34.647 --> 03:41:38.070]  And that's really where this goes, is you want to play video games all day?
[03:41:39.121 --> 03:41:42.323]  But yeah, God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:41:42.323 --> 03:41:46.445]  I've actually, let's just say I've seen a few things.
[03:41:46.445 --> 03:41:51.827]  Let's just say I've seen some of the levels above this one, and it's unbelievably amazing.
[03:41:51.827 --> 03:41:53.448]  It's also scary.
[03:41:53.448 --> 03:41:56.349]  And so people have to be willing to face fear.
[03:41:56.349 --> 03:42:03.693]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face
[03:42:05.316 --> 03:42:14.302]  The other stuff, because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:42:14.302 --> 03:42:16.103]  And so this is playland.
[03:42:16.103 --> 03:42:17.704]  This is baby town.
[03:42:17.704 --> 03:42:18.505]  This is dress up.
[03:42:18.505 --> 03:42:21.907]  This is like little boys playing soldier in the woods.
[03:42:21.907 --> 03:42:24.128]  And you're like, well, this is pretty damn real and pretty.
[03:42:24.128 --> 03:42:24.729]  I understand.
[03:42:25.674 --> 03:42:29.896]  Let's understand, you don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:42:29.896 --> 03:42:33.018]  And, I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:42:33.018 --> 03:42:37.421]  I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master built.
[03:42:37.421 --> 03:42:39.522]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:42:39.522 --> 03:42:43.424]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[03:42:43.424 --> 03:42:44.605]  Not these devil worshippers.
[03:42:44.605 --> 03:42:47.527]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:42:47.527 --> 03:42:48.187]  I want life!
[03:42:48.187 --> 03:42:49.788]  I want Jesus!

[03:47:19.686 --> 03:47:25.369]  I got my song and I got you with me tonight.

[03:48:16.948 --> 03:48:18.148]  Oh, right here.
[03:48:34.244 --> 03:48:37.785]  Because you know you can't keep up with the Joneses.
[03:48:37.785 --> 03:48:38.646]  Can't be done.
[03:48:38.646 --> 03:48:40.666]  Never let that get hang up.
[03:48:57.060 --> 03:48:59.742]  Alright, this is a really serious report and it's 19 minutes long.
[03:48:59.742 --> 03:49:07.807]  We haven't uploaded to InfoWars.com and I can be in a good mood about all this and you can too, but I need you to share this video.
[03:49:07.807 --> 03:49:10.589]  It'll be uploaded the next hour to InfoWars.com.
[03:49:10.589 --> 03:49:18.374]  The title's basically Alex Jones' official response to the Roku ban and Sandy Hook developments.
[03:49:18.374 --> 03:49:19.795]  And it's really important.
[03:49:19.795 --> 03:49:23.998]  I was almost late getting on air today because I was up here getting ready for the show and I was having meetings and I said, you know,
[03:49:25.453 --> 03:49:31.397]  I just, I'm in this regular studio too much, and people almost just take this studio like, oh, it's just regular Alex.
[03:49:31.397 --> 03:49:32.298]  Let's do it in another studio.
[03:49:32.298 --> 03:49:37.381]  People tend to pay attention to it, but this is really life and death, and I don't want to be overconfident in this whole thing.
[03:49:37.381 --> 03:49:43.905]  They are branding me with things I haven't done to hurt you, and you have to understand that.
[03:49:43.905 --> 03:49:45.626]  This isn't just some saying.
[03:49:45.626 --> 03:49:46.487]  I'm bound to you.
[03:49:46.487 --> 03:49:47.928]  You're bound to me.
[03:49:47.928 --> 03:49:48.968]  We're in this together.
[03:49:48.968 --> 03:49:52.871]  We hang together, hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said, and so
[03:49:54.312 --> 03:49:58.295]  Whatever you got to do, your whole text message list, your whole email list, whatever it is.
[03:49:58.295 --> 03:49:59.716]  Hey, here's the guy they're lying about.
[03:49:59.716 --> 03:50:01.417]  Did you ever hear what he actually had to say?
[03:50:01.417 --> 03:50:05.821]  And then you heard the CIA and the Washington Post saying, oh God, he's dangerous.
[03:50:05.821 --> 03:50:06.822]  Don't, don't listen.
[03:50:06.822 --> 03:50:08.223]  He's super persuasive.
[03:50:08.223 --> 03:50:09.764]  I don't have teleprompters.
[03:50:09.764 --> 03:50:11.085]  I'm not that good.
[03:50:11.085 --> 03:50:12.686]  I'm just not a devil worshiper.
[03:50:12.686 --> 03:50:21.753]  You know, that's what's so frustrating about this is these people are missing their basic humanity.
[03:50:21.753 --> 03:50:22.914]  And that's what they're so scared of.
[03:50:24.232 --> 03:50:26.354]  And thank God Trump's pulling people out of all these countries.
[03:50:26.354 --> 03:50:34.920]  Thank God he's trying to fix juvenile justice and justice reform and not give blacks longer prison sentences than white people.
[03:50:34.920 --> 03:50:37.822]  You hear a damn word out of the leftist black controllers?
[03:50:37.822 --> 03:50:41.325]  No, because they were funded by the KKK to keep control of black people.
[03:50:41.325 --> 03:50:46.049]  And I'm not going to sit here and patronize black people and kiss your ass like I'm some racist.
[03:50:46.049 --> 03:50:50.052]  I just don't want you to get aborted and died and just let's just go forward and live our lives.
[03:50:51.536 --> 03:50:51.836]  Get it?
[03:50:51.836 --> 03:50:52.437]  Black racist?
[03:50:52.437 --> 03:50:52.997]  I don't like you.
[03:50:52.997 --> 03:50:55.159]  I don't like all your pompous BS, all your crap.
[03:50:55.159 --> 03:50:57.060]  By the way, I don't want to kill you.
[03:50:57.060 --> 03:50:59.362]  So, you're smart, right?
[03:50:59.362 --> 03:51:00.483]  Come with me if you want to live.
[03:51:00.483 --> 03:51:02.044]  And that doesn't mean come with me.
[03:51:02.044 --> 03:51:06.447]  It means this information's the damn truth.
[03:51:06.447 --> 03:51:14.674]  You think my soul wants a bunch of dead black babies and a bunch of black people in prison so that I feel big and powerful?
[03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:26.005]  And I'm not gonna sit here and watch a bunch of leftists pin that on me or Trump or anybody when we're actually trying to free your ass.
[03:51:26.005 --> 03:51:28.227]  But you gotta free yourself first.
[03:51:28.227 --> 03:51:42.415]  So I'm not gonna kiss your ass when I sit here and try to pull a drowning man out of the water that the government's tied steel bowling balls to.
[03:51:42.415 --> 03:51:43.176]  I'll just tell you this.
[03:51:48.228 --> 03:51:51.711]  Owen Schroer is coming up and I'll get him to air this full video there too.
[03:51:51.711 --> 03:51:54.413]  Please ask Owen as soon as he can the first hour to air my whole statement.
[03:51:54.413 --> 03:51:56.215]  It takes two segments and it needs to get out.
[03:51:56.215 --> 03:51:57.296]  It's very important.
[03:51:57.296 --> 03:51:58.276]  But the whole thing will be posted.
[03:51:58.276 --> 03:51:59.277]  Here's the first few minutes of it.
[03:51:59.277 --> 03:52:00.098]  We'll end this transmission.
[03:52:00.098 --> 03:52:01.599]  Here it is.
[03:52:01.599 --> 03:52:11.508]  Last night, hundreds of newspapers, TV stations, and television networks all unanimously ran the same headlines.
[03:52:12.449 --> 03:52:24.999]  That Alex Jones, because he's dangerous, has been taken off of the popular streaming service Roku less than one day after his new channel went up.
[03:52:24.999 --> 03:52:32.405]  I have a statement about what really happened with Roku and what this signifies for free speech in this country in a moment.
[03:52:33.643 --> 03:52:45.458]  But first, I want to look at the heart of why we've been removed off of Roku and hundreds of other platforms in a systematic, coordinated campaign.
[03:52:45.458 --> 03:52:52.627]  The Democratic Party, led by Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, chose to make Sandy Hook, and my statements about it,
[03:52:53.891 --> 03:53:03.279]  The centerpiece of their campaign against Donald Trump in the final months of the 2016 presidential campaign.
[03:53:03.279 --> 03:53:14.808]  Hillary Clinton and the willing accomplice corporate media then twisted and exaggerated what I had said about Sandy Hook.
[03:53:14.808 --> 03:53:21.893]  When Hillary subsequently then lost the election, that continued to be one of the main narratives the Democrats
[03:53:22.861 --> 03:53:31.226]  We're putting out and it became mythological what I had supposedly done at Sandy Hook and who I had sent to go after the families.
[03:53:31.226 --> 03:53:33.587]  None of it was true.
[03:53:33.587 --> 03:53:35.688]  But I had been typecast.
[03:53:35.688 --> 03:53:42.612]  I had been labeled the Sandy Hook denier man.
[03:53:42.612 --> 03:53:50.977]  When in the full spectrum of what I've covered and what we've done here at InfoWars, Sandy Hook has been less than one tenth of one percent
[03:53:52.409 --> 03:53:53.930]  of what we've covered.
[03:53:53.930 --> 03:53:58.633]  But that was in the first four or five years after the tragic events.
[03:53:58.633 --> 03:54:18.624]  In the following three years, yes it's hard to believe it's been almost eight years, the media began to hype what I had supposedly said and done as a way to again get people to dislike me and to not listen what I had to say on a host of issues.
[03:54:18.624 --> 03:54:18.804]  Now,
[03:54:20.578 --> 03:54:32.764]  Fast forward to 2018, members of the Sandy Hook families, through prominent Democrat lawyers, filed lawsuits on me.
[03:54:32.764 --> 03:54:36.026]  Now, years before, I had said that I thought Sandy Hook happened.
[03:54:36.026 --> 03:54:47.911]  Years before, I had said, don't go to the Sandy Hook folks' houses, because I'd already been falsely blamed over and over again for doing that in the beginning when I never did.
[03:54:47.911 --> 03:54:48.952]  And steadfastly,
[03:54:50.302 --> 03:54:57.228]  The lawyers and the families and all the PR people will never quote me.
[03:54:57.228 --> 03:54:59.690]  They'll never call me for a comment.
[03:54:59.690 --> 03:55:11.419]  And they go, the lawyers, the families, all these people on television and on New York Times podcast just last week, and say, if he'll just stop saying our children died, we wouldn't sue him.
[03:55:11.419 --> 03:55:14.742]  If he'll just stop harassing us, we'll stop.
[03:55:14.742 --> 03:55:18.185]  And when I first heard this a few years ago, I was like, I did say I thought it happened.
[03:55:18.185 --> 03:55:19.386]  Here's a tape from three years ago.
[03:55:20.270 --> 03:55:22.475]  That was two years ago, so that was five years ago.
[03:55:22.475 --> 03:55:24.681]  And there would never be any response.
[03:55:24.681 --> 03:55:29.412]  So then I started reaching out to the families long before I was sued, saying, hey,
[03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:32.371]  The internet questioned what happened.
[03:55:32.371 --> 03:55:33.993]  People saw some anomalies.
[03:55:33.993 --> 03:55:40.199]  The public questions big events because the babies in incubators in the Iraq War didn't get their brains bashed out.
[03:55:40.199 --> 03:55:41.440]  That launched a whole war.
[03:55:41.440 --> 03:55:43.522]  People know about Gulf of Tonkin.
[03:55:43.522 --> 03:55:45.063]  It was based on a lie that killed millions.
[03:55:45.063 --> 03:55:49.327]  People know about false flags, both in fiction and in nonfiction.
[03:55:49.327 --> 03:55:53.151]  The whole House of Cards TV show had that almost every episode.
[03:55:53.151 --> 03:55:54.953]  So the fact that the internet questioned
[03:55:56.334 --> 03:55:57.116]  Sandy Hook.
[03:56:06.952 --> 03:56:15.175]  Sandy Hook investigators, some of them were so kooky and so aggressive that I began to realize that some of what they had found wasn't true.
[03:56:15.175 --> 03:56:19.297]  So that I couldn't say that it was totally synthetic and staged.
[03:56:19.297 --> 03:56:30.861]  But it doesn't matter because it's all taken out of context and used as a bludgeon to beat the free press and myself and my family, and I have children, over the head.
[03:56:30.861 --> 03:56:32.262]  So it's not fair.
[03:56:33.581 --> 03:56:35.322]  And it's destructive.
[03:56:35.322 --> 03:56:55.775]  Even if you hate Alex Jones or the image they've built in the media, to say it's hurtful to say nobody died, and to say don't come to people's houses, and then it's the very lawyers and PR firms that are out there saying it over and over and over and over again in my name, in my identity.
[03:56:57.165 --> 03:56:58.826]  And I have made countless videos.
[03:56:58.826 --> 03:57:00.146]  We have reached out.
[03:57:00.146 --> 03:57:09.149]  I have said, please stop saying that I'm currently saying go to people's houses when I never did it to begin with.
[03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:10.989]  They're saying there's a clear and present danger.
[03:57:10.989 --> 03:57:13.230]  They're saying there's a crisis.
[03:57:13.230 --> 03:57:18.992]  They're saying that you've got to take him off the air because he's sending people to harass us.
[03:57:18.992 --> 03:57:24.394]  That is a false report to the wider world, published everywhere.
[03:57:25.182 --> 03:57:32.424]  There have been over 10,000 published articles in different newspapers demonizing... Alright, we're going to have a break.
[03:57:32.424 --> 03:57:33.904]  This is a really important video.
[03:57:33.904 --> 03:57:37.525]  I'm asking listeners what I love and I respect and I appreciate.
[03:57:37.525 --> 03:57:41.146]  When it goes live the next hour at InfoWars.com is share this video.
[03:57:41.146 --> 03:57:41.946]  Stay with us.
[03:57:41.946 --> 03:57:43.146]  Worm coming up.
[03:57:43.146 --> 03:57:47.007]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:57:48.385 --> 03:57:57.048]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:57:57.048 --> 03:57:59.049]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:57:59.049 --> 03:58:02.510]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:58:02.510 --> 03:58:05.111]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:58:05.111 --> 03:58:07.412]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:58:07.412 --> 03:58:14.355]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[03:58:14.915 --> 03:58:24.698]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:58:24.698 --> 03:58:25.879]  We'll win.
[03:58:25.879 --> 03:58:28.779]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:58:28.779 --> 03:58:35.942]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:58:35.942 --> 03:58:39.623]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globalist may win.
