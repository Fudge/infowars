[00:46.080 --> 00:53.600]  taking your phone calls talking to Congressman Ron Paul about the controlled financial implosion
[00:53.600 --> 00:59.800]  being orchestrated by the military industrial complex in a financially military coordinated
[00:59.800 --> 01:05.360]  attack against the free people of the planet not just the United States and dentured servitude
[01:05.360 --> 01:12.200]  and the financial enslavement and is being set up right now Bob Chapman the international
[01:12.200 --> 01:18.840]  forecaster will pop in for his weekly visit as well and Webster Griffin Tarpley another expert
[01:18.840 --> 01:23.320]  on the world banking system been breaking down for more than a decade exactly what we're now
[01:23.320 --> 01:30.280]  witnessing by design so Congressman Ron Paul fresh off grilling the private fellow reserve
[01:30.280 --> 01:35.080]  chairman yesterday in the banking committee in the house will be joining us Webster Tarpley and
[01:35.080 --> 01:46.000]  Bob Chapman today I'm gonna break down the the false reality that the public is being handed
[01:46.000 --> 01:56.560]  and given on the economic Armageddon that we're witnessing just the just the foreshadowing of
[01:56.560 --> 02:03.440]  it that we're currently saying versus what's really happening in the real world where we
[02:03.440 --> 02:09.480]  actually live and so I'm going to do that in the next 30 minutes before Tarpley joins us then
[02:09.480 --> 02:16.840]  Ron Paul Bob Chapman in that order today we will also open the phones up when Tarpley is on with
[02:16.840 --> 02:23.000]  us and Bob Chapman we only have Ron Paul for 30 minutes so we won't be taking calls who knows
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.600]  I might take a few but we'll see what happens there maybe I should open the chat room up by
[02:30.600 --> 02:37.080]  open the chat room up maybe somebody should make a entry in the area of the prison planet forum
[02:37.080 --> 02:42.880]  there's a section for live questions on the air I do peruse it daily and the perhaps folks should
[02:42.880 --> 02:47.520]  post short questions there and then one or two of your questions will probably make an on air
[02:47.520 --> 02:53.200]  with Congress from Ron Paul because I love the directions and the angles that listeners take
[02:53.200 --> 02:57.880]  us in a lot of times bring up points that are more salient and that cut to the heart of the
[02:57.880 --> 03:05.160]  matter even more so than I would or our informed guest would we have quite an audience to be able
[03:05.160 --> 03:11.400]  to pull on though most of them are working when we're on the air so can't call into the show you
[03:11.400 --> 03:18.920]  can certainly you can certainly go over to the prison plant forum and put some of the questions
[03:18.920 --> 03:33.320]  in there also we need to deal with the military situation last week last Thursday we made much
[03:33.320 --> 03:42.440]  to do about the Army times calmly reporting that a armored brigade combat brigade from Iraq
[03:42.440 --> 03:49.320]  under North com would have crowd control riot control quote non-lethal weapon patrol of the
[03:49.320 --> 03:54.040]  United States they're going to be rotating different brigades in preparing them for a
[03:54.040 --> 04:00.800]  homeland mission and there was a spectrum of responses to us posting that and covering it
[04:00.800 --> 04:05.360]  and writing some articles several articles in the last week about it it runs the gamut from
[04:05.360 --> 04:10.120]  people saying oh it's just training it's no big deal to people on the comment sections in the
[04:10.120 --> 04:16.280]  story is going why isn't Alex covering this he's covering it up to people freaking out over
[04:18.120 --> 04:21.640]  now you know that's coming tell pro but we leave it up there we let people post what they want up
[04:21.640 --> 04:27.480]  there unless they call for murders of people believe me we don't have the time of the energy to go
[04:27.480 --> 04:33.560]  through their racing thing so we just leave 98% of it up but you've got to know it's going
[04:33.560 --> 04:38.680]  tell pro folks it's just not just idiots when they go in there and constantly accuse us when
[04:38.680 --> 04:45.800]  we are the main authors of exposing the militarized covert takeover and i made films on the subject
[04:48.680 --> 04:55.480]  11 years ago and then to claim that i'm covering up the military takeover it's just
[04:55.480 --> 05:04.840]  unbelievable we'll be right back stay with us on september 11th 2001 along with hundreds of my
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.960]  fellow troops i went to grounds here and we knew what to do or at least we thought we did

[08:03.880 --> 08:06.840]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:12.760 --> 08:17.240]  we have the stunt of john mccain trying to cancel the debate tomorrow night with uh
[08:17.240 --> 08:19.080]  uh his colleague
[08:21.960 --> 08:29.720]  it's like hulk hogan fighting the iron sheet it's all completely staged they train together
[08:29.720 --> 08:36.920]  they stay in the same hotel together they come in the same limo for the w w f event it is totally
[08:37.480 --> 08:44.600]  staged it is a joke but what's going on they're grandstanding to make it look like
[08:44.600 --> 08:49.720]  the presidential debates matter and like these people are important and bush is calling them to
[08:49.720 --> 08:56.120]  the white house today to have a economic summit as the republicans and democrats circle the wagons
[08:56.120 --> 09:04.280]  because in every major poll right at or under 30 percent agree with the stick up i mean the bailout
[09:05.880 --> 09:09.880]  the takeover of the real economy by the criminal bankers that's what it is
[09:09.880 --> 09:15.160]  but they know how to label things deceptively and then we spend all our time just educating people
[09:15.160 --> 09:22.440]  about what it really is and by then it's too late again this is military psi op precision
[09:22.440 --> 09:27.560]  devastation all laid out we told you years ago the real money was moving offshore getting out
[09:27.560 --> 09:33.640]  of the country they plan to pop the subprime this show this radio show didn't tell you that
[09:33.640 --> 09:39.640]  it was just coming an economic collapse we told you exactly how it would happen and what year
[09:39.640 --> 09:47.240]  it what happened 2008 over and over and over and over again in news articles and guests and experts
[09:47.240 --> 09:56.280]  and nobel prize winners for economics congressman on and on and on we told you exactly what's going on
[09:58.840 --> 10:04.040]  i mean we're so informed about what's going on because we keep our nose to the grindstone
[10:04.040 --> 10:08.760]  that it's basically like we're police detectives that have been tracking a serial killer for years
[10:08.760 --> 10:13.960]  and we've gotten so inside his mind that we know where he's going to strike next
[10:13.960 --> 10:19.800]  what type of woman he's going to grab off the street next we told you exactly what they were
[10:19.800 --> 10:25.960]  going to do and they're doing it right now in front of you this whole thing is a giant
[10:25.960 --> 10:30.920]  psychological warfare operation but before i get into all of that and play some audio clips of
[10:30.920 --> 10:39.720]  bush last night and break it all down i was on coast to coast a 4 in the morning couldn't get
[10:39.720 --> 10:45.080]  to sleep till about 5 30 so i am i am chipper let me tell you this morning you're on the air
[10:45.640 --> 10:51.400]  i actually am fired up i feel great i'm going to be uh basically beat though when the show's over
[10:51.400 --> 10:55.480]  but but get ready we got three hours and 50 minutes spanning out before us with webster
[10:55.480 --> 11:01.080]  tarpley ron paul bob Chapman and others on this live september 25 2008 edition
[11:04.120 --> 11:07.400]  but speaking of psychological warfare let me let me set the table
[11:08.120 --> 11:14.200]  for something you know not just the staged wars or the stage terror or the stage economic collapse
[11:15.480 --> 11:23.720]  let's break down what a country in receivership looks like and how they've sold the childlike
[11:23.720 --> 11:31.960]  public on accepting their bondage okay and i and i wonder if the police and the social
[11:31.960 --> 11:37.720]  workers have ever looked at the prison that you're also building around yourselves because we're all
[11:37.720 --> 11:43.640]  in this together whether you like it or not you're with us you're with the american people you're not
[11:43.640 --> 11:48.280]  in some elite position immune from this you're going to get hurt just as bad probably worse
[11:48.280 --> 11:52.840]  and everything that's happening because you're going to be expected to defend the corrupt system
[11:52.840 --> 11:57.400]  as things get darker and darker by the day this is going to stretch out for years
[12:01.400 --> 12:05.640]  if a child in front of a hundred witnesses at a park falls off a jungle gem and breaks
[12:05.640 --> 12:10.200]  their finger or arm which happened to most of us growing up there's a good chance the parents
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.560]  are going to fight with lawyers their lives everything they've got maybe just to keep the child
[12:16.920 --> 12:19.320]  but about a third of the time the government's going to take your child
[12:19.320 --> 12:23.880]  it doesn't matter if you have witnesses doesn't matter if it was just an accident
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.480]  doesn't matter if your child's playing with their brother or sister and slams their finger
[12:27.480 --> 12:33.400]  in the front door something i did playing with friends one time hide and seek you know running
[12:33.400 --> 12:39.880]  around in the house you take your child the hospital they're gone the hospitals have been
[12:39.880 --> 12:47.640]  trained and prepared like stasi to be just watching and waiting you drive without insurance you're
[12:47.640 --> 12:51.480]  going to get a ticket and a lot of times they go ahead and arrest you now you don't have your seat
[12:51.480 --> 12:56.680]  belt on in your own neighborhood pulling up your mailbox they arrest you now in the town where i live
[12:56.680 --> 13:04.040]  austin texas you're a pregnant woman who sits down on a bench too long in new york they arrest you
[13:04.840 --> 13:09.720]  you bring your gatorade with the top on it on the subway they say no food or drink they arrest you
[13:09.720 --> 13:16.040]  these are all mainstream articles you take a cake to your teacher when you're graduating from high
[13:16.040 --> 13:21.640]  school you're the valovictorian you pull out the plastic knives and forks the police see it you're
[13:21.640 --> 13:31.240]  arrested your degree is taken scores of examples like that the book is completely thrown at the
[13:31.240 --> 13:39.080]  american people who are the milk cows the sows that are bled illegal aliens because they have a job
[13:39.080 --> 13:44.520]  to drive down the wages break down the society and bankrupt the states with unfunded mandates for
[13:44.520 --> 13:48.760]  health care welfare and the rest of it i'm not attacking them i don't blame them wanting to be
[13:48.760 --> 13:57.640]  here i'm just stating facts they come up here they get pulled over drunk no id no nothing
[13:58.440 --> 14:05.720]  insurance they get let go but citizens don't now i've set the table with that there's hundreds of
[14:05.720 --> 14:19.880]  other examples meanwhile there is a story that's up on the drudge report i want this up on info
[14:19.880 --> 14:28.680]  wars and prison planet dot com with the headline police to stop responding to crimes that's right
[14:28.680 --> 14:33.640]  you heard me read the headline local six news out of florida now this already officially happened
[14:33.640 --> 14:41.640]  20 years ago in dallas i've had two cars stolen in dallas and they laugh at you on the phone when
[14:41.640 --> 14:46.760]  you want the police to come out and then i said fine you can't help me and hung 911 up and the
[14:46.760 --> 14:51.960]  police showed up five minutes later getting in my face saying why'd you hang up on 911 see it's
[14:51.960 --> 14:57.080]  about the bureaucracy it's about you licking boots it's about you learning to be a slave
[14:57.080 --> 15:05.080]  police may stop responding to some crimes budget crunch forces move to be considered and it says
[15:05.080 --> 15:13.400]  robberies of homes robberies of cars not to be responded to now now of course they put an emotional
[15:13.400 --> 15:20.040]  salve an excuse and they're very very sick listen to this palm bay florida a budget crunch in palm
[15:20.040 --> 15:26.280]  bay may mean city residents who forget to secure car doors or close garages will get only a case
[15:26.280 --> 15:30.280]  number and nothing in terms of a visit by patrol officers and something is stolen
[15:32.120 --> 15:37.720]  so see it's it's that excuse oh you're bad citizens you know you uh pulled up and took
[15:37.720 --> 15:42.200]  the groceries and somebody ran in and stole your car and so we're not going to investigate crime now
[15:45.000 --> 15:52.040]  but you run a red light or you use slow stop at a sign or your text messaging in your car we're
[15:52.040 --> 15:59.880]  going to arrest you your child draws a picture of somebody with a gun at school like every other
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.440]  boy does we're going to arrest your child zero tolerance but that's because it's only for the
[16:04.440 --> 16:11.880]  fat cows our fat slaves were suck and dry not for real criminals the police revision is part of a
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.040]  wider cost-cutting look at the palm bay police department 200 million annual budget yeah i bet
[16:16.040 --> 16:19.160]  they're not going to stop having cops out right and take it's a little old ladies are asking for
[16:19.160 --> 16:23.720]  which procedure grabbing cash out of their purses we're looking very seriously at types of calls
[16:23.720 --> 16:29.400]  we will go to palm bay police chief bill burgers said still about 85 to 90 percent of the people
[16:29.400 --> 16:34.120]  who've had their cars broken into left the car doors open but obviously it's an actual break
[16:34.120 --> 16:40.200]  in will respond on and on and on because we've got more serious things to do they've more than
[16:40.200 --> 16:47.560]  triple the number of cops in this country and you can't get one you know woman gets mugged in the
[16:47.560 --> 16:53.880]  heart of town calls for the police but there's none around he's out on the interstate setting the
[16:53.880 --> 17:02.360]  trap for a live one to skin and wrap cue that song up drag him off the interstate socket to him jd
[17:02.360 --> 17:10.520]  blues want to play that later the bottom of the hour coming in so that's what's going on
[17:11.880 --> 17:17.000]  meanwhile in austin texas every week i hear about i'm shutting down a major highway shutting down
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.560]  downtown panicking hyperventilating freaking out a cardboard box blows out of a car bomb
[17:23.560 --> 17:26.840]  squads and the police always show up because it's meant to send a psychological message
[17:26.840 --> 17:30.840]  there's terrorists everywhere and you need paramilitary police and intelligence units and
[17:30.840 --> 17:35.640]  all the federal funding and the emergency centers that spy on the citizens and spy on the churches
[17:35.640 --> 17:39.880]  and spy on the peace groups we need us there's terrorists oh my gosh you know they have all
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.280]  these fake drills which they admit their own documents are meant to create fear to create the
[17:44.280 --> 17:51.400]  realism of the terror threat well it's the same thing here hot dog outside philly ballpark causes
[17:51.400 --> 18:00.760]  bomb scare uh there was a paper plate with two hot dogs on it laying on the ground and the citizens
[18:03.720 --> 18:09.880]  there's terrorists everywhere there's hot dogs play the clip this is the total mind control
[18:09.880 --> 18:15.400]  the public sundar tonight's philly's game goes on as scheduled despite a bomb scare at citizens
[18:15.400 --> 18:21.240]  bank park just a few hours earlier three suspicious packages were found just outside of a gate that
[18:21.240 --> 18:25.960]  leads into the park fans who had already arrived for the game had to be evacuated as a precaution
[18:25.960 --> 18:31.320]  and uh players were actually kept on the field well the bomb squad arrived and they detonated
[18:31.320 --> 18:37.160]  that package turns out there was nothing more inside than some hot dogs wrapped in duct tape
[18:37.160 --> 18:46.760]  but there was packaging and duct tape um i don't see many um hot dogs sold here with duct tape
[18:46.760 --> 18:51.960]  but you know that's all i we just did what uh we thought was appropriate oh yeah well philly's
[18:51.960 --> 18:58.280]  officials say the packages that did not contain any type of explosive device okay so what that's
[18:58.280 --> 19:03.240]  about is and see they always blow something up so that kind of creates the psychological it's all
[19:03.240 --> 19:08.040]  pavlovian psychological warfare it's all opera conditioning there's a boom and see they came

[25:11.080 --> 25:17.080]  things that are happening with a controlled financial collapse here is some of the news
[25:17.080 --> 25:24.040]  we have today roiders u.s to lose financial superpower status germany and all that's
[25:24.040 --> 25:29.160]  happening is the international banks are fully sucking the united states dry and having the
[25:29.160 --> 25:35.240]  american people sign on to their international quadrillion in derivatives that's over one
[25:35.240 --> 25:44.120]  thousand trillion now a year ago and we have articles upon info wars dot com that break
[25:44.120 --> 25:51.400]  down all the official numbers on this it was only sixty one billion dollars that was owed
[25:52.040 --> 25:59.560]  um in mortgages in the united states and now it's only a little over a hundred billion dollars
[25:59.560 --> 26:06.440]  even with the devaluation in the real estate market in many areas of the nation some areas
[26:06.440 --> 26:13.240]  still holding firm like austin texas to some extent now how is it that they need a five
[26:13.240 --> 26:20.280]  trillion dollar bailout by the way that's bloomberg financial last night saying i have the headline
[26:20.280 --> 26:29.400]  i have the headline right here headline bailout not 700 billion more like five trillion just google that
[26:29.400 --> 26:35.960]  you can read it on bloomberg financial and that is conservative if you read the bailout bill
[26:36.600 --> 26:43.240]  that was secretly written up sunday and released monday it states no one can review it the treasury
[26:43.240 --> 26:49.000]  basically becomes a private institution with the private federal reserve and they are allowed to do
[26:49.000 --> 26:56.440]  anything by any derivatives by any stocks by international bank stocks they can do anything
[26:56.440 --> 27:03.480]  they want and then i was listening to talk radio shows this morning with all these disinfo agents
[27:03.480 --> 27:08.520]  and an establishment economist on saying this isn't really a bailout the government the taxpayers
[27:08.520 --> 27:14.520]  are getting really good assets you know they're getting some really good financial instruments
[27:15.160 --> 27:18.760]  well number one you're not getting anything let's say they were solid gold they're not there
[27:18.760 --> 27:25.080]  they're the they're fraud they're just paper instruments leverage times a million but but
[27:25.080 --> 27:30.840]  let's say they were worth something private banks are having it handed over to them the money is
[27:30.840 --> 27:37.640]  being given to goldman sacks and others and guess who the former head of goldman sacks is the treasury
[27:37.640 --> 27:47.080]  secretary who still has huge holdings himself in it so it is just mass crime right out in the open
[27:47.080 --> 27:52.680]  and we have john mccain coming out and saying let's suspend the debates let's suspend the
[27:52.680 --> 27:58.600]  campaign for now kind of a trial balloon for suspending the campaign period as cnn was saying
[27:58.600 --> 28:03.800]  last night oh yeah cnn saying are they talking about suspending the campaign period you know things
[28:03.800 --> 28:09.720]  are so bad and then barack obama says no now he says maybe they're meeting today at the white house
[28:09.720 --> 28:14.920]  to grandstand to have the republicans and democrats team up and say to the american people hey we know
[28:14.920 --> 28:21.480]  in ross muson polls and other polls 25 to 30 percent depending on which poll you look at summer 25
[28:21.480 --> 28:28.440]  some 28 some 30 but around 25 30 percent of your for the stick up that they call the bailout
[28:29.080 --> 28:34.600]  the total takeover of the banking system of the real economy that's all that's happening
[28:35.240 --> 28:37.960]  they're just getting us even deeper into hawk with them through a fraud
[28:37.960 --> 28:45.080]  but so so we have the the congress we have both parties circling the wagons
[28:47.160 --> 28:53.560]  saying that listen american people you're wrong you've got to sign on to this you've got to say
[28:53.560 --> 28:59.080]  you're going along with it you've got to say you believe in it because later we're going to take
[28:59.080 --> 29:03.640]  everything you've got and remind you that you signed on to it we have to convince you at least
[29:03.640 --> 29:10.520]  publicly uh to to to go along with this and so all the parties and all the politicians are getting
[29:10.520 --> 29:18.120]  together to try to sell you on that idea right now and it also props up the illusion that joe
[29:18.120 --> 29:23.960]  biden and sarah palin and barack obama senator mccain actually run something or do something
[29:23.960 --> 29:29.160]  they are carrying out a scripted program that both both of the candidates both the republican
[29:29.160 --> 29:34.680]  and democratic candidates have the very same set of advisors the very same uh think tanks it is it
[29:34.680 --> 29:41.400]  is all orchestrated right now the bank robbery is taking place right now and whether you're a fireman
[29:41.400 --> 29:46.920]  a cop a school teacher an auto mechanic a doctor a lawyer this is going to hurt all of us this is

[35:54.600 --> 35:59.880]  always exposing the angle american global banking cartel before we go to webster when everybody
[35:59.880 --> 36:05.000]  understands something everything that was foretold everything we warned you about everything my
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.080]  films have covered you are now seeing the front of the storm it's like a hurricane coming in it's
[36:11.080 --> 36:19.400]  a category five going 154 miles an hour you're only feeling the leading edge before it hits
[36:19.400 --> 36:26.360]  this is 20 mile an hour winds you're feeling you're going to feel 150 plus mile an hour winds
[36:26.360 --> 36:32.440]  financially there's your analogy for the hour and let me tell you something me and my wife were
[36:32.440 --> 36:38.680]  praying this morning okay i mean i'm on my knees folks i got up here on the air and
[36:38.680 --> 36:44.120]  and you know i don't put on a bluster but i mean that's just what comes out once i'm on air i put
[36:44.120 --> 36:49.560]  a good face on it that we're going into this storm with our chins up on our chest out but let me
[36:49.560 --> 36:55.000]  tell you something that all of you better get yourselves right with god because this is going
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.360]  to make the great depression whether it comes this year five years from now whatever the trajectory
[37:00.360 --> 37:06.200]  of this is and it looks like sooner rather than later it's going to make that look like a sunday
[37:06.200 --> 37:12.360]  walk in the park as they say because we had 90 percent of the population being agrarian
[37:13.640 --> 37:19.000]  rural farmers and they were self-sufficient and seven million according to major studies that
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.480]  have been done by universities between seven and ten million the conservative number seven million
[37:23.480 --> 37:29.560]  starved to death during the great depression starved to death now if if if seven million we
[37:29.560 --> 37:34.600]  were only a country of 200 million if seven million starved to death and 90 percent were
[37:34.600 --> 37:41.080]  self-sufficient then what is going to happen when we've got 90 percent living in the city 10
[37:41.080 --> 37:46.280]  percent on the farms and only half of those on the farms are self-sufficient and that's a you know
[37:46.280 --> 37:49.800]  that's that's trying to make it look good it's probably less than five percent that are really
[37:49.800 --> 37:54.040]  self-sufficient i got family lives on the farm lives on the ranch and let me tell you they're not
[37:54.040 --> 37:59.400]  self-sufficient they are close to it with wells and gardens and canned foods and but but i mean could
[37:59.400 --> 38:05.720]  they take care of themselves in a road warrior situation that that remains to be seen could i
[38:05.720 --> 38:10.680]  take care of myself certainly not folks uh you know those skills sets are being lost now remember
[38:10.680 --> 38:16.760]  pinkerton security rockefeller security they went in during the depression they ran people off their
[38:16.760 --> 38:22.840]  farms and ranches the banks would call in the whole note by the way that's still in the still in the
[38:22.840 --> 38:30.840]  rules now uh they've changed the law so they can take the pension funds i want to ask webster tarpily
[38:30.840 --> 38:34.280]  you know he's trying to fix the financial crisis he's been trying to stop it he's been trying to
[38:34.280 --> 38:39.240]  put out ideas that i agree with on how to fix it you know take over the federal reserve nationalize
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.440]  it monetize it i mean there's a lot of ideas uh pump you know the the five trillion it's not
[38:44.440 --> 38:49.720]  seven or a billion into the people's hands that needs to be done now because it all is fiat we're
[38:49.720 --> 38:56.120]  paying for it anyway we of other corporations this is all out war this is the last you know
[38:56.120 --> 39:01.560]  few moves in a chess game here that's been going on for decades everything positioning us everything
[39:01.560 --> 39:07.880]  getting our industry offshore getting the family broken down uh balkanizing communities buying up
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.120]  local public utilities handing them over to private corporations who just shut them down
[39:12.120 --> 39:20.760]  strip mining the economy so webster tarpily before we get into the uh details of what's
[39:20.760 --> 39:26.040]  currently happening and then the two party circling the wagons to sell the stick up
[39:26.040 --> 39:30.520]  or the total transfer to paulson i know by now you've had time since it came out monday i interviewed
[39:30.520 --> 39:36.200]  last week to read the bailout bill the stick up bill and it just it literally is the private
[39:36.200 --> 39:42.120]  banking system becoming the government taking everything uh being able to steal homes infrastructure
[39:42.120 --> 39:46.200]  this is the executive orders where they can take land work brigades i mean folks this is
[39:46.200 --> 39:50.440]  hell on earth you think things are bad if they get the the bailout through the way they want it
[39:51.160 --> 39:56.120]  it is not a bailout it's a takeover so webster first off instead of getting into the economics
[39:56.120 --> 39:59.400]  and i want to get into that how do we because i don't think there's any stopping this now
[40:00.040 --> 40:05.480]  though we see only 28 and ross muson poll for it so maybe there's some way to stop them but then
[40:05.480 --> 40:09.640]  they're going to crash the economy and say we caused it and then get a propaganda victory and
[40:09.640 --> 40:14.120]  then later pass some bailout so they'll actually get both i mean it's a very sophisticated game
[40:14.120 --> 40:17.800]  we're playing here only getting the word out and some mass way to stop it i don't know if we have
[40:17.800 --> 40:22.680]  the power to do that so i think you're getting the gist of this long five minute diatribe of the
[40:22.680 --> 40:28.600]  facets i want from your mind i want to pick your brain the listeners do of of of a what do you
[40:28.600 --> 40:35.240]  think of what i just said and then b how do we organize quickly so they don't take the farms
[40:35.240 --> 40:39.880]  and ranches so they don't uh... corporatize it instead of nationalizing they're going to be
[40:39.880 --> 40:46.840]  stealing everything and handing it in uh... to this this this warmock this juggernaut uh... as the
[40:46.840 --> 40:52.760]  private banking system goes to war against humanity webster griffin tarpley thank you alex i would
[40:52.760 --> 40:59.400]  recommend first of all political mobilization political action uh... the the sort of survivalist
[40:59.400 --> 41:04.680]  side of things you can do in in in your spare time right get them uh... get some stuff in the
[41:04.680 --> 41:10.520]  pantry and all that that's all that's all fine but political action and a lot of people have never
[41:10.520 --> 41:17.000]  tried it so this is now the time to try it the the power of the finance oligarchs has thrived
[41:17.000 --> 41:25.080]  in an atmosphere of public uh... passivity apathy lethargy not voting not caring above all not
[41:25.080 --> 41:30.600]  being active because politics is uh... it's not it can't be a full-time job for many people but
[41:30.600 --> 41:36.360]  it was a couple of nights away giggling morbid population train that it's cute to not care
[41:36.360 --> 41:41.640]  and cute to be uninformed and now if people think it's bad now they have no idea yeah you can just
[41:41.640 --> 41:46.280]  take the time you're devoted to some idiotic sporting event which is just bread and circuses
[41:46.280 --> 41:52.840]  provided by the same wall street uh... bandits and and about that too to politics now obviously
[41:52.840 --> 41:58.360]  the the imperative right now is to mobilize to stop the bailout and any reason to vote against
[41:58.360 --> 42:05.080]  the bailout is a good reason and in the anti bailout coalition you can easily have a lot of
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.120]  very diverging points of view about what ought to be done after that and and and there are
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.800]  but certainly the minimum common denominator of of civilized humanity is that you've got to be
[42:15.800 --> 42:22.680]  against the the bailout now as you say success is not guaranteed especially because it looks like
[42:22.680 --> 42:28.120]  we've got a pan oligarchical coalition we've got all the oligarchs of all the different
[42:28.120 --> 42:32.920]  stripes who are now coming together to say that they're going to have to put aside their
[42:32.920 --> 42:38.120]  ideological scruples they're going to have to put aside their their various free market
[42:38.120 --> 42:43.400]  ideological uh... pabulum yes wester they know it's a fight they are circling the wagons both
[42:43.400 --> 42:48.760]  parties against us and even in austin and dallas and listening to local radio they are dispatching
[42:48.760 --> 42:53.720]  cfr members globalist to speak to the business councils and saying hey get behind this get
[42:53.720 --> 42:58.920]  behind this and they're terrorizing people and saying or they'll be a depression next week
[42:58.920 --> 43:05.320]  well uh... there is of course a a prospect of an immediate deflationary crash but uh...
[43:05.320 --> 43:09.320]  using the sorts of methods that i recommend and these are of course new deal methods
[43:09.320 --> 43:14.920]  it is proven uh... using that the these these methods you can stop the depression
[43:14.920 --> 43:17.880]  in a single day and and begin to turn it around but
[43:17.880 --> 43:21.880]  let's just let's just look at it now it's not so apocalyptic as people think
[43:21.880 --> 43:26.280]  what we're in now you might say is the herbert hoover phase of things
[43:26.920 --> 43:30.360]  uh... and let's take it back to nineteen thirty one nineteen thirty two
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.360]  hoover created something called the reconstruction finance corporation
[43:34.360 --> 43:38.440]  and with the help of congress put about three to four billion dollars in it
[43:38.440 --> 43:41.240]  and the three to four billion in those days was a lot of money
[43:41.240 --> 43:45.800]  if you want to estimate inflation i think that went a good way to estimate inflation is to use
[43:45.800 --> 43:51.000]  postage stamps in those days the first class letter cost two cents today it's forty two cents
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.680]  that looks like a two thousand percent uh... inflation rate so
[43:54.680 --> 43:58.840]  if you multiply the three to four billion of them by two thousand
[43:58.840 --> 44:02.680]  uh... you're more or less in the ballpark that you say right four five six
[44:02.680 --> 44:08.280]  trillion dollars that have been thrown into this between fanny may freddy mac the current bailout
[44:08.280 --> 44:13.960]  other sorts of liquidity injections and so forth now the trick about the reconstruction finance
[44:13.960 --> 44:19.880]  corporation under hoover was that it was a failure why was it a failure simply because
[44:19.880 --> 44:23.560]  under conditions of economic breakdown financial panic
[44:23.560 --> 44:25.800]  uh... and the things that we have today
[44:25.800 --> 44:31.640]  it is impossible to maintain paper values forget paper values they are irrelevant
[44:31.640 --> 44:35.960]  you've got to think about the survival of civilization the survival of humanity
[44:35.960 --> 44:42.200]  production you've got to produce the wherewithal for human life forget about paper forget about
[44:42.200 --> 44:48.120]  property titles forget about investment returns forget about all the this
[44:48.120 --> 44:54.120]  the apparatus we're talking getting back to the real economy the basis of production
[44:54.120 --> 45:00.120]  and and life right in other words tangible physical production commodity production now
[45:00.120 --> 45:06.040]  in any rational system we should be giving cheap subsidized credit preferentially
[45:06.040 --> 45:10.200]  to people who want to do something productive that means manufacturing goods
[45:10.200 --> 45:15.800]  farms transportation but instead the globalist uh... have been penalizing that and paying
[45:15.800 --> 45:20.120]  people to go offshore but what i said this position exactly what we've got today is
[45:20.120 --> 45:23.480]  the world turned upside down we've got reality stood on its head
[45:23.480 --> 45:28.280]  what we've got is a bailout program that only touches financial institutions
[45:28.280 --> 45:31.880]  and everybody else be damned even companies that still produce
[45:31.880 --> 45:35.000]  something useful i mean you've got a the way the world is set up right now you
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.480]  got to have cars that means you've got to have
[45:37.480 --> 45:41.000]  a general motors and forward and christler and those assembly lines
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.240]  are a precious asset with the trained skilled labor that are associated with
[45:45.240 --> 45:48.440]  them you've got to keep those things together because if you don't have that
[45:48.440 --> 45:51.800]  you've you've literally go down the tubes you approach a point you can even
[45:51.800 --> 45:53.800]  build army tanks without those people
[45:53.800 --> 45:59.080]  thermodynamic breakdown that means that everything grinds to a halt and it does
[45:59.080 --> 46:01.800]  exist and the people that are running with this
[46:01.800 --> 46:06.120]  this idiotic show today are are basically not that they don't want to see that
[46:06.120 --> 46:09.000]  now the reconstruction finance corporation
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.280]  was a failure under hoover precisely because it tried to prop up paper values
[46:14.280 --> 46:18.200]  it tried to save in solvent banks you can't do any of this stuff
[46:18.200 --> 46:21.800]  we should look at the reconstruction finance corporation as it existed under
[46:21.800 --> 46:25.880]  roosevelt and jesse jones of texas who was one of the great
[46:25.880 --> 46:30.280]  are the people who built the united states he had the reconstruction finance
[46:30.280 --> 46:34.040]  corporation and he said i'm not going to try to prop up paper values
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.560]  and in insolvent banks i'm going to create things like
[46:37.560 --> 46:41.080]  the synthetic rubber corporation the chemical corporation the war plant
[46:41.080 --> 46:44.440]  corporation in other words new plant and equipment
[46:44.440 --> 46:49.000]  creating high-paying industrial jobs that soaked up unemployment expanded the
[46:49.000 --> 46:52.840]  tax base and led to recovery and of course some of the recovery
[46:52.840 --> 46:56.680]  had to wait until world war two but a lot of it was done for example during the
[46:56.680 --> 47:00.440]  year of nineteen forty one that's the year that that unemployment really
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.160]  disappeared under land lease uh... that kind of that kind of uh... policy
[47:05.160 --> 47:08.440]  uh... would be effective today what we basically need today is a land lease
[47:08.440 --> 47:12.600]  program to fight the depression on the home front right land lease of course
[47:12.600 --> 47:14.320]  land lease to ourselves
[47:14.320 --> 47:16.360]  yeah let me tell you that you know what
[47:16.360 --> 47:20.120]  you don't need to be producing for britain or the soviet union or
[47:20.120 --> 47:23.640]  anybody else you could basically say it by our family land there's several
[47:23.640 --> 47:26.040]  bridges that have collapsed this year in texas
[47:26.040 --> 47:30.680]  i mean this is where i live and and and we could start right there
[47:30.680 --> 47:33.640]  i mean we could start fixing our infrastructure that's exactly where you
[47:33.640 --> 47:37.240]  should start at the rebuilding of infrastructure but here's the idea
[47:37.240 --> 47:41.000]  the way we have the system we have now is that the inherent power of the federal
[47:41.000 --> 47:44.200]  government to be its own bank and to coin money to the
[47:44.200 --> 47:48.120]  the constitution says the congress has the power to coin money today that would
[47:48.120 --> 47:48.840]  mean
[47:48.840 --> 47:52.680]  the uh... currency issuance of the united states and the interest rates
[47:52.680 --> 47:56.280]  ought to be decided by public law that's all we have under our system
[47:56.280 --> 47:59.880]  the house the senate and the president signs that it's debated in public and
[47:59.880 --> 48:02.680]  it says the currency issue for the new year is this much
[48:02.680 --> 48:05.800]  and the interest rate target is going to be this
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.040]  so not by the market because there is no market that the market right there i am
[48:10.040 --> 48:14.360]  a free market person the problem is with these crime syndicates we don't have a
[48:14.360 --> 48:17.960]  free market just like in ron had fake trading computers
[48:17.960 --> 48:21.800]  in california stealing over a billion a day uh... for a year
[48:21.800 --> 48:26.040]  i mean what we're dealing with here is just a a small coterie
[48:26.040 --> 48:29.080]  of criminals explain that to people webster who jeb these are these are this
[48:29.080 --> 48:33.320]  is not free market this is socialism for them they take our money
[48:33.320 --> 48:36.920]  they take our industry there can be no investment in anything that helps us
[48:36.920 --> 48:40.840]  because everything has to be greedily taken up to them and then leverage to
[48:40.840 --> 48:44.680]  infinity so they can grab up other infrastructure which they then greedily
[48:44.680 --> 48:46.440]  let rot in their hands
[48:46.440 --> 48:49.400]  yeah i don't agree with the slogan of the free market i don't think there's been
[48:49.400 --> 48:51.960]  a free market anywhere in the world for several centuries
[48:51.960 --> 48:55.160]  and to pretend that it has existed i think it's on the wrong track
[48:55.160 --> 48:58.440]  but the the main issue now is the question of credit
[48:58.440 --> 49:00.760]  and and the federal reserve now this of course is
[49:00.760 --> 49:03.800]  it's run by a banker's cabal i think people are familiar with this
[49:03.800 --> 49:08.040]  it was it was set up the way it is under rockefeller and morgan above all right
[49:08.040 --> 49:11.720]  the house of morgan dominates wall street still does jp morgan chase
[49:11.720 --> 49:15.960]  is the centerpiece of it jamie diamond is the jp morgan of today
[49:15.960 --> 49:20.040]  so you have the inherent power of the federal government to issue money
[49:20.040 --> 49:24.440]  is somehow hijacked by the federal reserve this came up in the hearings
[49:24.440 --> 49:28.600]  the other day uh... helicopter ben bernanke was asked in the senate banking
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.560]  committee how is it that you do what you do
[49:31.560 --> 49:34.360]  and he says well we were created by the federal reserve act
[49:34.360 --> 49:38.360]  the congress has the power to issue currency but they have delegated that
[49:38.360 --> 49:42.120]  power to us now this is unconstitutional you can't change the
[49:42.120 --> 49:46.200]  constitution with a statute and that is what the federal reserve act and last
[49:46.200 --> 49:48.520]  week you have to do it job i go into the states
[49:48.520 --> 49:52.440]  now now we're gonna come back and talk more about this but remember last week
[49:52.440 --> 49:55.320]  paulson tried to tell congress well we don't need you
[49:55.320 --> 49:59.080]  but but that because we have contractual agreements with the federal reserve
[49:59.080 --> 50:01.560]  and now they're claiming they have contractual agreements with foreign
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.880]  banks uh... so stay there let's come back he wants to bail out foreign banks
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.960]  and now they're having to back off and say okay we need congress to sign the
[50:09.960 --> 50:13.960]  dotted line but can congress constitutionally
[50:13.960 --> 50:18.200]  sign a blank check uh... ceding imperial
[50:18.200 --> 50:22.040]  right of king's power to the bankers and the answer is no
[50:22.040 --> 50:26.440]  can congress legalize throwing children off cliffs no they can't
[50:26.440 --> 50:32.760]  so they're all criminals as a parent your biggest fear is getting a phone call
[50:32.760 --> 50:36.600]  that your child has been attacked or worse with your child going to college

[53:33.960 --> 53:38.440]  your living history ladies and gentlemen
[53:38.440 --> 53:43.640]  new world order is making its move right now
[53:44.680 --> 53:52.120]  history shows they have miscalculated at this moment of attack
[53:52.120 --> 53:55.640]  this moment where they attempt to take over the entire
[53:55.640 --> 53:59.000]  world financial system that they've already been sitting on top of but
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.200]  they want to fully bankrupt it so they can consolidate it
[54:02.200 --> 54:05.640]  at this point they're very weak they've exposed themselves as criminals
[54:05.640 --> 54:09.000]  the public out of the gate doesn't believe anything they say
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.520]  they're operating in a 20 30 year old paradigm when they control the newspapers
[54:12.520 --> 54:15.960]  and television before the rise of the alternative media
[54:15.960 --> 54:20.600]  webster do you agree that they have miscalculated and that we could
[54:20.600 --> 54:24.360]  uh... certainly use their miscalculation
[54:24.360 --> 54:27.720]  uh... to open up a wider front against their operations
[54:27.720 --> 54:30.920]  and that this could be the catalyst that destroys the Anglo-american crime
[54:30.920 --> 54:35.000]  syndicate well i think we do need to mobilize against it i i don't
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.200]  see them operating according to a timetable in other words the process
[54:38.200 --> 54:40.520]  of dissent into a new world depression
[54:40.520 --> 54:45.080]  is uncontrollable from the point of view of any single oligarchical faction
[54:45.080 --> 54:50.120]  in this uh... polycentric but they're attempting to control it and use it as
[54:50.120 --> 54:53.560]  a uh... centrifuge black hole consolidate
[54:53.560 --> 54:57.480]  well they try to turn the crisis uh... against the people that would
[54:57.480 --> 54:59.960]  there's a world depression they want you to pay for it
[54:59.960 --> 55:03.080]  we want them to pay for it a world depression cost about
[55:03.080 --> 55:06.920]  a hundred uh... trillion dollars or five hundred trillion dollars
[55:06.920 --> 55:10.520]  we think the bankers should pay they created the depression
[55:10.520 --> 55:14.920]  they created this mess the finance oligarchs should pay through the nose
[55:14.920 --> 55:18.200]  for the current world economic depression people should not pay
[55:18.200 --> 55:22.280]  no austerity right they should have to discourage all the real assets
[55:22.280 --> 55:25.640]  that they've been snatching up with the previous Ponzi scheme
[55:25.640 --> 55:29.240]  yes and above all they should pay for the actions that they've taken that have
[55:29.240 --> 55:31.240]  destroyed and annihilated
[55:31.240 --> 55:35.000]  uh... the these resources again i just like to get back to the federal reserve
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  what you have today is if you i'm jp morgan chase i can go to the federal
[55:39.000 --> 55:39.720]  reserve
[55:39.720 --> 55:43.640]  and borrow money for two percent or less two percent is the normal
[55:43.640 --> 55:48.040]  uh... interbank rate uh... the federal funds rate right which the which the open
[55:48.040 --> 55:50.760]  market committee that's now the open market committee
[55:50.760 --> 55:54.680]  has in it a lot of unelected unaccountable people from the federal
[55:54.680 --> 55:58.120]  reserve district and those people represent the bank
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.400]  of san francisco the banks of chicago the banks of atlanta
[56:01.400 --> 56:04.040]  and boston and all the rest of it and they all vote
[56:04.040 --> 56:08.040]  the new york fetus always represented there they represent wall street so they
[56:08.040 --> 56:08.760]  vote
[56:08.760 --> 56:11.160]  to set the uh... interest rates
[56:11.160 --> 56:15.320]  and and that that is imposed on the rest of us so if i'm jp morgan chase
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.480]  i can borrow at that interbank rate that federal funds rate
[56:19.480 --> 56:23.400]  which is right now it's about two percent i can then turn around and lend that
[56:23.400 --> 56:26.760]  money back to the u.s treasury at four and a half
[56:26.760 --> 56:28.360]  to five percent
[56:28.360 --> 56:30.480]  now we think of what what that means
[56:30.480 --> 56:33.160]  that if you're walking in a two-and-a-half percent to three-and-a-half
[56:33.160 --> 56:34.240]  percent profit
[56:34.240 --> 56:37.520]  and often the spread is bigger often it's five or six percent
[56:37.520 --> 56:41.680]  for doing absolutely nothing why do we have to create the federal reserve
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.280]  so they can land to jp morgan chase
[56:44.280 --> 56:47.960]  so jp morgan chase can lend to the treasury why not nationalize the
[56:47.960 --> 56:48.960]  federal reserve
[56:48.960 --> 56:52.160]  cut jp morgan chase out of the game
[56:52.160 --> 56:54.240]  let them go in and uh... money
[56:54.240 --> 56:55.440]  some other way
[56:55.440 --> 56:59.480]  and the inherent capacity of the u.s government to finance itself
[56:59.480 --> 57:02.160]  comes into play why do we need to have this
[57:02.160 --> 57:05.560]  crew of wall street money center bank
[57:05.560 --> 57:06.760]  who are there
[57:06.760 --> 57:11.760]  simply to parasitize the public debt and the currency formation of the united
[57:11.760 --> 57:15.800]  states that gets worse jp morgan chase is supposed to be a commercial bank
[57:15.800 --> 57:19.440]  commercial bank is supposed to use to traditionally they would make loans to
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.920]  businesses to create new plant and equipment new businesses new jobs
[57:23.920 --> 57:26.960]  productive jobs maybe your pet highly paid jobs
[57:26.960 --> 57:31.000]  they don't do that anymore jp morgan chase and the rest of them city bank
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.920]  bank of america the really big ones what called the uh... and so forth
[57:34.920 --> 57:37.080]  those are not commercial banks anymore
[57:37.080 --> 57:38.840]  those are derivatives
[57:38.840 --> 57:40.000]  monsters
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.120]  right now if you look in the official statistics from the controller of the
[57:43.120 --> 57:48.040]  currency at the federal reserve of the treasury in this case they will tell you
[57:48.040 --> 57:51.780]  the jp morgan chase officially carries almost one
[57:51.780 --> 57:55.400]  hundred trillion dollars of derivatives
[57:55.400 --> 57:56.360]  but that is
[57:56.360 --> 57:58.600]  six or seven times
[57:58.600 --> 58:03.080]  the gross national product of the united states it's impossible it cannot be
[58:03.080 --> 58:07.720]  maintained it's not a fraud to stay there are guests webster tarpley back

[58:26.580 --> 58:32.600]  standard
[58:32.600 --> 58:35.260]  not a lot of work
[58:35.260 --> 58:38.360]  and
[58:38.360 --> 58:41.440]  there
[58:41.440 --> 58:47.760]  questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door seven years
[58:47.760 --> 58:54.080]  after the attacks of september 11 a global awakening has taken place an inside job
[58:56.160 --> 59:02.880]  how dare you if you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for
[59:02.880 --> 59:08.000]  treason yourself all hell is breaking loose on sixth avenue and if the government has not told
[59:08.000 --> 59:13.920]  the truth in five years we will be here on the tenth anniversary of rising download the film at
[59:13.920 --> 59:19.760]  prison planet dot tv right now or get the dvd at info wars dot com it's now time to take the revolution
[59:19.760 --> 59:37.440]  at the next level waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network big brother mainstream
[59:37.440 --> 59:47.600]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[59:47.600 --> 59:55.920]  and now live from austin texas alex jones the international banking oligarchs have created
[59:57.040 --> 1:00:02.880]  a tsunami of fraudulent paper they used to buy real assets now they plan to give themselves
[1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:07.440]  dictatorial powers in the name of fixing the problem they created the lonely people
[1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:15.280]  webster carpley author researcher joins us he's breaking this down with his particularly
[1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:22.640]  insightful perspective he'd gotten up to just jp morgan chase with a hundred trillion
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:28.320]  conservatively in derivatives alone uh webster continue that that's just the official figure
[1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:33.360]  they say a hundred trillion of derivatives but it's really something like 300 or how and i don't
[1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:38.320]  we don't know how many because it's not reportable it's completely deregulated one of the obvious
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:43.920]  things you'd have to do to come forward with this package to say spend 700 billion if you wanted
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:48.800]  any credibility at all you'd have to say and we're banning derivatives from now on we're going to
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:53.440]  outlaw derivatives because that is the that's the heart of this crisis now if you listen to the
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:58.400]  hearings i think the senate banking committee hearings with with hanky panky paulson of goldman
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:05.440]  fax helicopter ben Bernanke this reckless incompetent cox who's the head of the
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:08.880]  securities and exchange commission and the guy called lockhart from the federal housing
[1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:16.320]  administration they all uh... they try to avoid saying that this is a crisis of derivatives
[1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:22.160]  they say these are mortgage related securities that is not the essential point that they are
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:27.680]  derivatives and in the course of this strangely enough a little bit elizabeth dole who's running
[1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:33.040]  for a uh... trying to keep her seat in uh... in the senate in north carolina she may get defeated
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:38.560]  so she was a little bit more um... radical let's say in the questioning she starts asking about
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:46.000]  credit default swaps credit default swaps now as soon as you say credit default swaps paulson
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  of the treasury starts saying that's a huge market they're huge they're huge yeah it is huge
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:56.480]  it's at least five hundred trillion it may be it may be as much as seven that's what's
[1:01:56.480 --> 1:02:01.520]  bringing down a i g that it certified it but you just moved over a key point you made
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:05.200]  i want to go back to this now or later if you like webster but make sure we cover it
[1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:12.480]  this the statement that this is people defaulting on mortgages literally has nothing to do with
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:17.040]  it we're talking about a hundred billion there this is their excuse to blame it on the people
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:22.640]  this is about the leverage derivatives that right it's peanuts in other words the fact that some
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:29.600]  poor schmoe got a mortgage an adjustable rate mortgage and then defaulted because he couldn't
[1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:36.480]  pay is basically irrelevant in other words that's a that's a factor of tertiary or less
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:43.280]  significance it's just a side issue that they throw in naturally adjustable rate mortgages
[1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:48.480]  should have always been illegal yeah they're predatory loan sharking usury but the point
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:52.960]  is it's a red herring escape goat yeah because what they've got now is it is a theory and you
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:58.000]  hear this they say um a lot of loans were made that should never have been made a lot of greedy
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:03.040]  people bought more house than they could afford and that has led to the present crisis this is
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:10.240]  absolutely nuts you're talking about a a derivatives bubble i again estimate one quadrillion that is
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:16.800]  one thousand trillion dollars to one point five quadrillion to maybe as much as two quadrillion
[1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:22.880]  we don't know because none of this is regulated none of it is reportable one of the main categories
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:28.720]  is sure to be credit default swaps uh... hanky panky paulson himself talked about
[1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:35.840]  mortgage backed securities that's obviously a derivative because it's paper based on paper
[1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:41.360]  it's not mortgages it's not even a bundle of mortgages it's a bundle of mortgages with an
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:47.920]  extra layer of derivatives paper added to the top and i was betting on the index if you want to
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:52.640]  solve fanny may and freddy mack the first thing you want to do is go in there and say look any
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:58.160]  mortgage backed securities that you have we're going to strip off that top layer of derivatives
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:03.040]  and declare that illegal we're not going to pay that in other words we keep you come down to the
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:08.240]  following uh... big one point five quadrillion of derivatives
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:13.200]  antithetical to the future of human life that's right it's a cancer that cannot be physically
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:19.760]  paid back it's hundreds of times all the assets in the world this is the black hole we must escape it
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:23.680]  we'll talk about how we don't have a side plus the amazing conflict of interest
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.320]  to have the former head of goldman sacks henry paulson heading up uh... this titanic

[1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:55.360]  that we know what concerns me the most is out of the gates the last few months
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:59.200]  the corporate on media owned by the big banks and hedge funds and defense contractors that
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:04.400]  pulled these scams they are just telling us over and over again no one did anything criminal
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:09.840]  no one's bad no one's going to be investigated no one's going to be jailed and that's really
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:13.600]  just like bush had them retroactively you know pass something to destroy the fourth amendment
[1:09:13.600 --> 1:09:19.040]  for warrantless spying on the american people uh... so so he's trying to
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.880]  you know basically uh... get a pardon retroactively
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:26.880]  it's the same thing and i'm i'm sure you've read the section where it says nothing can
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:31.120]  be investigated nothing can be reviewed by any court the government any agency
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:35.440]  nothing nothing these financial institutions ever did once they go into the umbrella
[1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:38.320]  of paulson who again headed up goldman sacks
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.120]  uh... they can use the money they can leverage it they can buy more derivatives they can
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:47.920]  speculate i mean this is just unspeakably corrupt and wicked and you have the very
[1:09:47.920 --> 1:09:49.840]  people that engineered it doing it
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:53.120]  uh... so so how do we bring them to justice
[1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:57.440]  uh... the the the first aspect is the the draft sent by paulson and bernanke was
[1:09:57.440 --> 1:10:01.760]  this this infamous three-page outline where paulson says
[1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:05.840]  everything that i do is above the law nothing can be reviewed not by a court
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:07.840]  not by a federal agency
[1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:12.240]  that is blatantly unconstitutional i actually think that some of the
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:16.560]  uh... extreme provisions of that three-page document
[1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:20.480]  were put in there as a kind of a kabuki dance in other words he says
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:23.760]  i want seven hundred billion dollars and i want it now and you can't review what
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:26.000]  i do and i get to do whatever i want
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.960]  and to help with you and then he can moderate and it's the fault and then you
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:29.680]  can
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:33.520]  he can then he can become more reasonable i believe that particular provision has
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:37.360]  already been dropped because that would be sure to be overturned
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:41.040]  by the supreme court if there is a supreme court but it is obviously in
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:44.160]  flagrant violation of the constitution look
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:48.000]  i would focus right now on getting the policy straight later on what you have
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.120]  state power you can put you can prosecute all sorts of people
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:53.440]  you can't put the cart before the horse
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:56.720]  the the question of a world economic depression
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:00.720]  is that it goes beyond stealing uh... the question of a world economic
[1:11:00.720 --> 1:11:01.760]  depression is
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:05.200]  the wrong policies that have now been in place
[1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:09.600]  for decades these are monetarist policies in my book these are the milton
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:13.520]  freedman chicago school policies okay what we're gonna get into that moment
[1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:15.280]  i'm gonna give you the floor to cover that
[1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:18.080]  but i i i don't think that's part before the horse
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:21.520]  that discredits their entire current
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:24.880]  wrong policies you put it but to them it's by design
[1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:29.120]  and so you you know justice be done may the heavens fall it's been said
[1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:33.120]  in different ways and so we need to while everybody's paying attention to
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:34.480]  this a year from now
[1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:37.440]  you know people will be focused on whatever the new issue is or some
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:38.560]  russian war
[1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:42.320]  or uh... and and and then the mainstream media can can basically
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:45.760]  create collective amnesia you know i mean you're saying that we don't need to
[1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:48.960]  point out their criminals now a lot of our criminals but here's the thing you
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:52.080]  gotta understand the reason that you're seeing all these criminals is
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:57.120]  as it's been said when the tide goes out you find out who's swimming naked in
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:01.520]  other words a lot of the embezzlement a lot of the theft a lot of the abuses
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:05.760]  are now being revealed by the fact that a world economic depression
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:08.880]  is in progress in the roots of the world economic depression
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:13.920]  go back to people like nixon kissinger author burns george schultz who's still
[1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:18.960]  around so it's kissinger meeting in britain uh... camp david august 15th
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:23.120]  nineteen seventy one the wanton destruction of the breton woods economic
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:26.960]  system the fixed parodies and gold settlement that had worked
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:30.480]  uh... remarkably well since nineteen forty four to allow the greatest
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:34.880]  increase in human productive power in all of recorded history that was thrown
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:38.640]  out under the pressure from the british who were demanding gold payment not to
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:42.400]  gold not the french but the british and ever since then we've seen a
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:46.480]  decline in production standard of living in a recent week going down and and
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:50.320]  risk above all the growth of risk about ten years ago the head of jp morgan
[1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:53.200]  chase went on television and he said you know
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:56.720]  my bank is in the risk business meaning we gamble
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:59.680]  the jp morgan chase is a huge gambling casino
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:04.240]  now that's not what they should be uh... they should be providing credit loans to
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:06.480]  cut corporations for plant equipment
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:09.760]  and the creation of it should be an engine of growth and stability not a
[1:13:09.760 --> 1:13:10.800]  crime syndicate
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:14.880]  and and above all this aspect of derivatives as gambling that simply
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:15.840]  a bet
[1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:19.200]  it's a bucket shop uh... it's it's just a kind of of
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:23.360]  of gambling and if that's what you're doing you have no ability to come to the
[1:13:23.360 --> 1:13:24.560]  public and they look
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:26.240]  we're a public utility
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:27.600]  you should bail us out
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:31.040]  they're not okay go back to the point you were making earlier the way that the
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:33.040]  risk came into the system
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:37.280]  is because of the above all the greatest risk of all this currency risk
[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:40.320]  from nineteen forty four to nineteen seventy one
[1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:42.320]  currency risk was minimal
[1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:45.520]  uh... but the system was destroyed the british didn't like it the british
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:47.840]  wanted floating rates and competitive
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:52.640]  evaluations the canadian dollar was kept floating the entire time and they made
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.800]  speculation the economy
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:58.160]  they've been basically the speculators have taken over the economy under the
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:00.240]  ages of risk the problem is
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:01.680]  the entire system
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:04.800]  organized itself to protect against risk and now you see
[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:08.720]  that the credit default swaps that was supposed to be the way to remove risk
[1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:11.920]  clearly that's how they were sold to you to suckers
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:13.440]  they are now the center
[1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:17.640]  of risk so explain to people what a credit default swap is
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:21.600]  well it's kind of derivative it's a so-called insurance on somebody going
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:24.080]  bankrupt and now that they're all going bankrupt
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:25.600]  uh... this is bankrupting
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:29.120]  everybody so it's it's basically it's it's a derivative in the sense that it's
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:33.920]  paper based on paper it has built-in options and futures and other things
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:37.280]  and it can have you know it can have thousands and thousands of elements
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:40.320]  in it basically the thing that people have to know is that it's cancerous
[1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:42.240]  it's toxic it should be illegal
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:45.120]  and it probably has been in the illegal the entire time
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:49.200]  we had um... in nineteen thirty three there was an attempted corner the wheat
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:50.160]  market
[1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:53.600]  uh... in futures using options so futures options
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:54.480]  were used
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:57.760]  to try to to try to get control of all the wheat in the united states that led
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:14:59.280]  in nineteen thirty six
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:01.280]  to a very good new deal law
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:02.160]  that said
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:07.600]  options on agricultural commodities are illegal there are federal crime
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:11.520]  that remained in place until the great communicator ronald reagan came along
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:15.680]  and he abolished that in nineteen eighty two but again the the philosophy here is
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:20.320]  deregulation privatization and free markets those are the slogans
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:24.960]  under which the entire regulatory edifice of the new deal was destroyed
[1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:29.120]  uh... by people like english take the glass legal act is another great example
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:33.280]  the glass legal act to look up bank is one thing commercial bank is one
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:38.000]  category of institution you want to be a stock broker that's got to be separate
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.920]  all during the nineteen nineties the bankers agitated no no we don't like that
[1:15:41.920 --> 1:15:46.880]  we want to have jp morgan stock brokers merged with chase Manhattan bank now we
[1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:51.520]  want to have goldman fax as a bank we want to have morgan stanley as a bank
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:55.760]  so you go from investment bank which is no bank but really just a stock job or
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:59.600]  brokerage counting house operation we want to make that into a bank
[1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:03.360]  this is absolutely nuts this was this was the first thing they did in the new
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:04.880]  deal nineteen thirty three
[1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:08.160]  carter glass of virginia who was a very conservative
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:12.480]  guy said look uh... we've got to separate we got a fire wall
[1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:16.320]  between anything that has to do with issuing securities of any kind
[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:19.120]  and having responsibility for deposits
[1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:22.720]  uh... that that was abolished to take another example the uptick rule
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:25.760]  under the new deal the security and exchange committee commission was
[1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:27.040]  created and it said
[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:29.440]  you can't continue to short
[1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:33.360]  sell short a stock if it's just going down down down down down down
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:36.080]  today they abolished that this character cox
[1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:39.520]  who's the head of the security and exchange commission came in and last
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:43.040]  summer he abolished this uptick rule just in time
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:47.520]  for the great mud slide to begin which is not just in time they make it harder
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:51.360]  for the set that citizen to declare bankruptcy just in time
[1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:56.000]  uh... they they set rules for companies can steal pension funds
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:59.440]  they plan this uh... bank robbery uh... very very well
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:03.040]  now let's talk about policy you know we know what needs to be done
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:06.480]  versus what they're doing we have a circling of the wagons we have this
[1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:09.040]  meeting going on at the white house right now with obama
[1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.680]  and mccain and and and and and palin and and that policy and you know all of them
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:17.600]  in training already frank and dot don't forget party frank and dot because they
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:21.280]  are key yet they've been involved with the deregulation in the mid-1990s
[1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:25.120]  clinton grandstanding saying how great absolutely how great mccain is today
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:26.640]  rob rubin
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:30.960]  yet yet so they're all together now with a sales job and they've dispatched their
[1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:34.240]  minions in every major city we all over the media saying we've got to do this
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:35.600]  we've got to do this we've got to do this
[1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:39.600]  i break that down well i think in terms of the politics uh...
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:44.000]  what would be the most important thing is to have a uh... mass movement of uh...
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:47.400]  of of people of goodwill of all types
[1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:50.800]  to oppose this kind of thing but with realistic demands in other words
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:55.280]  if people say well my goal is to go back to a world where there's no income tax
[1:17:55.280 --> 1:17:57.120]  and no taxes of any kind
[1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:59.840]  the utopian program it's frankly crazy
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:02.560]  and if that becomes the program then that's a failure
[1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:05.520]  a little bit like what the communists did right the communists said look
[1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:09.360]  it's not enough to have radical reform we've got to have the complete
[1:18:09.360 --> 1:18:13.200]  revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat this crazy and then you
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:17.440]  get sixty million people starved to death it meant that in any situation where
[1:18:17.440 --> 1:18:20.800]  radical reform was possible the communists would come on the scene of
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:25.440]  the saboteur of what was really within reach so you've got to steer away from
[1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:29.280]  extreme ideological or utopian programs now
[1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:33.840]  the new deal of alternative which i represent is not utopian it is tried
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:37.920]  and true it is tested it has done it has been done before
[1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:42.400]  successfully it worked and it would work now it's the only thing that worked
[1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:46.960]  if we had gone ahead during the 1930s with more of this herbert hoover
[1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:51.280]  lay safe fair deregulation privatization free market don't touch the
[1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:53.280]  free market then
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:58.000]  we would have had death on a mass scale and by the time world war two came around
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.760]  uh... it would have been impossible to mobilize anybody okay well sir we got a
[1:19:01.760 --> 1:19:04.400]  break or come back and take off chris and brian and
[1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:07.920]  lindsey and matt and others always intriguing that webster for about another
[1:19:07.920 --> 1:19:12.880]  twenty something minutes uh... and and i want to be specifically get back as
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:16.720]  briefly about my view about the economic situation
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:20.960]  and uh... my idea about new deal s uh... policies
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:24.400]  uh... so uh... i'm i'm not particularly in favor of those
[1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:28.800]  compared to what we have with just mass stealing of the entire infrastructure
[1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:32.720]  it certainly is better

[1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:39.840]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:45.360]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the US,
[1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:48.800]  though the people of the US, where their numbers and influence are strongest,
[1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:52.720]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:56.320]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:00.720]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:03.520]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:22:03.520 --> 1:22:07.120]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago,
[1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:10.720]  everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:13.680]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:16.080]  the destruction of the earth and mankind.
[1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:20.080]  We will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:29.440]  The message of His Kingdom.
[1:22:30.080 --> 1:22:31.920]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:33.920]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:35.920]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:40.240]  Sound familiar? Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:45.520]  Introducing our patented Find One Find All Keyfinders or FOFA XD for short.

[1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:58.240]  or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.

[1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:03.360]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets up to 30 feet
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:06.160]  and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:07.200]  Got the remote!
[1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:08.960]  Oh, my keys!

[1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:36.640]  Yeah, I want to get away.
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:38.480]  I want to fly away, but I can't do that.
[1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:39.920]  I have a family and children.
[1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:42.800]  This is my country and I'm not letting them crime-sending to take it over.
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:49.040]  They can either take over now completely or we can expose their crimes and bring them to justice.
[1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:55.760]  Look, the British banking system orchestrated a collapse in 1929.
[1:23:56.320 --> 1:23:59.120]  They restricted liquidity.
[1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:01.600]  They criminally consolidated land.
[1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:05.680]  The Graves of Wrath, that movie, you should go watch it, but it was much worse than that.
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:14.240]  And then certainly the new deal over the next eight years or so leading into World War II,
[1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:20.160]  certainly that did create make work, that did set up jobs for people.
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:22.080]  A lot of folks didn't starve because of it.
[1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:27.120]  And so it's, you know, it truly is one of the lesser of two evils.
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:31.840]  Because out of that grew the social services system, the CPS kidnapping rings,
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:37.680]  the federalization of our local police, the militarized control grid, we now live under.
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:43.920]  The problem is in complex societies, you know, there is nothing utopic.
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:46.880]  And so you're always going to have some type of governmental structure and system.
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.280]  You're always going to have corrupt individuals and others, great power and wealth in government
[1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:52.080]  and in structures.
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:55.040]  So the corporations are going to move in, not your corporations, some little ones,
[1:24:55.040 --> 1:24:57.280]  the big ones folks, move in and take it over.
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:01.120]  So the main line conservatives say, oh, free market, leave it all the market, leave it alone.
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:04.240]  But then they use government power, government selective enforcement
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:08.000]  to really create a system that is government.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:09.040]  It's not free market.
[1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:14.000]  It's a corporate command hegemon.
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:20.640]  It's a predatory mercenary system of law of the jungle,
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:22.640]  with them beating their chest at the top of the temple.
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:27.760]  And so certainly do I want a $5 trillion bailout, as Bloomberg is saying it is,
[1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:31.440]  really $500 billion, not $700 billion to $5 trillion?
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:35.760]  Do I want that of the bankers, of the people that did all this?
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:36.000]  No.
[1:25:37.360 --> 1:25:42.640]  Now because they have deindustrialized us by design, stating it was to make us more easily managed.
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:49.120]  Now that there isn't any real industry left, 80 plus percent of it gone,
[1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:54.320]  now that the people are in such debt through the loan sharking that's gone on,
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:58.320]  that's all we can do now is take the power of the treasury,
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:02.560]  use it for what it was meant to do, and they're already devaluing the dollar.
[1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:06.880]  So might as well go ahead and flood the real economy with capital
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:11.600]  to generate an infrastructure for us to live in and on.
[1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:19.600]  And so I think that's where in the intellectual debates people get into this libertarian camp
[1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:25.040]  or into the kind of Webster-Tarpley government helping us view.
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:29.200]  The point is the government is bad, it's out of control, it has horrible things,
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:35.920]  but because it's become a minion or a control panel for this international crime syndicate,
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:38.640]  and it will certainly become that again if it's big.
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:42.240]  But I say in the interim, use it to help the people survive
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:45.440]  and then pare it down and control it in the future.
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:48.000]  Webster, we're going to come back and take calls, but I needed to just
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:49.840]  add my view on that. Do you have any comments?
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:54.960]  Well, if you look at history, I think you have a very hard time arguing,
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:56.400]  government is always bad.
[1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:00.160]  But one thing you probably can argue is that bankers are always bad.
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:06.560]  Finance oligarchs, finance elitists, financiers, finance capital,
[1:27:06.560 --> 1:27:10.960]  you can argue that that is, if it's left unchecked, that will be evil.
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:15.040]  The government could be good or bad depending on who controls the government.
[1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:18.240]  I reject this notion, big government is always bad.
[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:21.920]  You need a government that's powerful enough in some future moment,
[1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:26.560]  different than what we have now, with real leaders, a strong presidency, not a weak one.
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:31.440]  Again, a Lincoln, a Franklin D. Roosevelt, even a Kennedy was trying to do this,
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:33.600]  to stand up, to say no to Wall Street.
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:38.400]  Look at Kennedy fighting Roger Blau of US Steel, saying no to Wall Street
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:43.360]  and forcing US Steel to back down when that was a gambit put forward by Wall Street.
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:45.200]  Right now, you have three possibilities.
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:49.360]  You have a hyperinflationary bailout, which is what you're getting right now.
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:51.520]  That leads to the fascist corporate state.
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:53.760]  We have, we have, we have speculation.
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:55.040]  Were they collapsing, really?
[1:27:55.040 --> 1:27:57.440]  Sure, with, with the, with the World Economic Depression,
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:27:58.240]  because it doesn't work.
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:01.200]  You can't, you can't maintain the value of paper.
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:03.600]  Otherwise though, the people who come forward and say,
[1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:05.760]  do nothing, go back to the free market.
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:09.440]  That is a deflationary collapse right now.
[1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:12.080]  And if you have children, you have to look at them and say,
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.880]  do I want the next five or 10 years of their lives blighted and possibly ruined
[1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:19.600]  so that they can't go to college, that they can't get jobs,
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:20.800]  they can't have a normal life.
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:22.080]  But I see that as a fever.
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:23.360]  And I'm not saying I'm for that.
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:26.720]  I'm saying let's look at it because that would bankrupt the police state.
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:29.360]  That would bankrupt the, the Pentagon control group.
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:31.760]  Or, or let me finish, Webster, please.
[1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:33.440]  Or it could actually energize that.
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:38.240]  If you look at 1932, 1933, you'll see that the, you know, the, the,
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:41.280]  the deflationary collapse occurred in 1930.
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:43.360]  And Herbert Hoover said, oh no, I can't do anything
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.360]  because that would violate the free market.
[1:28:45.360 --> 1:28:47.520]  And the depression just got worse and worse.
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:50.640]  And in Germany, it got bad enough so that you could have an actual
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:52.400]  fascist seizure, seizure of power.
[1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:52.880]  No, no, I agree.
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:55.200]  They're, I mean, that's, it's, it's a wild card.
[1:28:55.200 --> 1:29:00.480]  And so I agree with you at letting it implode has a lot of really dangerous
[1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:02.720]  aspects.
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:04.240]  And that's why they built the police state.
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:07.600]  They intend to go to that physical fascist model.
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:10.720]  And so we come back briefly because I want to go calls for you.
[1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:12.800]  Um, briefly then talk about the other alternative.
[1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:14.080]  Webster, Tarpley's our guest.
[1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:17.520]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are the website.
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:19.360]  My new film, Truth Rising is now available.
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:23.040]  We're on the march.
[1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:24.720]  The empire's on the run.
[1:29:25.520 --> 1:29:28.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:31.520 --> 1:29:34.720]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:38.240]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:40.880]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:42.400]  But who is the enemy?
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:43.200]  bin Laden.
[1:29:43.200 --> 1:29:44.320]  This is his ammo.
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:45.600]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:29:45.600 --> 1:29:47.520]  We have to look to the Psalm of bin Laden.
[1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:51.680]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:54.720]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:58.800]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged
[1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:00.960]  in spying in and on the US.
[1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:05.280]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:07.200]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA.
[1:30:07.200 --> 1:30:09.120]  The hijackers ties to the FBI.
[1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:10.560]  The Saudi Arabian connection.
[1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:12.240]  The Israeli intelligence network.
[1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:13.360]  Warnings and war games.
[1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:14.320]  The shadow government.
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:15.520]  And much, much more.
[1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:16.720]  Fabled enemies.

[1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:34.720]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[1:30:34.720 --> 1:30:36.960]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:40.240]  Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[1:30:40.240 --> 1:30:43.120]  And today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:44.880]  Finalized the contract in London.
[1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:47.040]  And demoed our new product in Boston.
[1:30:47.040 --> 1:30:49.760]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:53.040]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:54.720]  I just talked to clients on the phone.
[1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:57.840]  And they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:01.840]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[1:31:31.360 --> 1:31:34.800]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors
[1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:37.280]  in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[1:31:37.280 --> 1:31:42.320]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of nine or higher.
[1:31:42.320 --> 1:31:47.520]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:51.360]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:56.080]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[1:31:56.080 --> 1:31:59.920]  while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[1:31:59.920 --> 1:32:05.680]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:09.200]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste
[1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:11.760]  and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[1:32:11.760 --> 1:32:16.960]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:31.840]  Today!
[1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:19.760]  Baby, baby!
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:22.800]  I guess everybody's listening to the show and they know I'm a fan.
[1:33:22.800 --> 1:33:28.480]  I'm going to go back to Webster Tarpley.
[1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:32.800]  Just a moment.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:35.600]  Man, it's hard to turn music off like this.
[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:37.920]  Crank it up for 30 seconds.
[1:33:48.160 --> 1:33:49.040]  All right, that's enough.
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:57.040]  We've got to get back to the real world what's happening.
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:02.000]  Webster Tarpley, recap those three different scenarios you hadn't got to the third yet.
[1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:10.160]  The three of these, the hyperinflationary bailout and CNBC is now reporting that
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:15.440]  the congressional leaders have announced agreement in principle on the $700 billion
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:20.960]  bailout with some, you know, window dressing, the stuff about no golden parachutes
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:23.840]  and some other stuff to make it look good.
[1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:27.120]  Webster kind of big, you have three possibilities.
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:32.480]  The hyperinflationary bailout, which is an attempt to maintain paper values
[1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:34.960]  by pumping in money, doesn't work, it's failure.
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:38.000]  This leads then to the fascist corporate state,
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:41.680]  but it also leads to things like the junkification of treasury bonds,
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:43.520]  the collapse of the dollar, and so forth.
[1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:48.080]  Then there's the free market alternative, the free market alternative says do nothing,
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:51.200]  and then you're going to get a deflationary crash.
[1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:55.120]  In other words, then you're going to get a situation where chain reaction bankruptcies
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:59.200]  go through the big commercial banks and the banking community,
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:01.120]  and ultimately everything grinds to a halt.
[1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:04.000]  A possible road warrior scenario.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.200]  You're going to have, you know, no food in the supermarkets in a couple of months,
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:08.800]  right, or weeks.
[1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:10.960]  The third possibility is new deal measures.
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:14.560]  The new deal measures would be wipe out derivatives,
[1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:17.440]  seize bankrupt banks, and triage them.
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:20.720]  Some of them should be shut down, some of them might survive,
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:24.240]  but wipe out the derivatives, delete them, cancel them.
[1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:28.160]  And I say arrest a whole bunch of the criminals engaged in derivatives
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:33.040]  to send a shockwave through so they know the predatory activities in the markets are over.
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:33.600]  Absolutely.
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.920]  You want to be, you want to do some high-profile arrest.
[1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:37.200]  I'm all for that.
[1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:38.400]  Stop foreclosure.
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:41.840]  You want to keep people, all the politicians now say,
[1:35:41.840 --> 1:35:43.040]  keep people in their homes.
[1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:43.440]  Great.
[1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:45.280]  Let's have a uniform federal law.
[1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:48.000]  If you foreclose on anybody, you go to Leavenworth.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:52.640]  If you shut down a farm, a business, a taxi company, a trucking company,
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:57.520]  a ferry, a railroad, an airline, any factory that produces anything,
[1:35:57.520 --> 1:35:59.280]  a dry cleaner, anything.
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:03.520]  You go to federal prison if you try to shut that down over questions of debt.
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:09.280]  Because people are literally surviving on that, and people are saying, well, you can't do that.
[1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:13.280]  Oh, we can bail out the criminal bankers, but we can't keep our factories open.
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:15.040]  We want to have a bailout in reverse.
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:18.320]  We want to bail out production and people, not bankers.
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:21.280]  The other thing I think you've got to do is guarantee the social safety net.
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:23.920]  In other words, we're going to need unemployment insurance.
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:25.680]  We're going to need food stamps.
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:29.600]  We're going to need WIC for pregnant women to have enough proteins
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:31.600]  so you don't get cognitive defects.
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:33.760]  And so the CPS can kidnap them to you.
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:34.960]  That's about things like this.
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:38.480]  So you want to make sure that these payments are maintained.
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:41.200]  And then nobody tampers with Social Security,
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:43.360]  because then you're going to kill old people or Medicare.
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:48.240]  No entitlement reform, no privatization, no looting of that by Wall Street,
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:49.360]  because that would be the next step.
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:53.440]  And that will immediately start feeding a private investment back into the real economy.
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:58.080]  Yes, well, I think the step for investment then is you've got to say, look,
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:00.320]  the Federal Reserve is a failure.
[1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:03.760]  When the Federal Reserve, when it was instituted back under Woodrow Wilson,
[1:37:03.760 --> 1:37:08.240]  the argument coming from Rockefeller and his school of thugs was,
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:11.520]  if you get the Federal Reserve, you'll never have a financial panic again.
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:16.160]  Well, it failed in the 1920s by stoking the bubble.
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:18.880]  They were doing that to try to support the British pound
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:21.120]  for various reasons in the 1920s.
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:23.920]  The Federal Reserve is responsible in many ways
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:26.480]  for the Great Depression of the 1930s.
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:30.240]  And above all, the Federal Reserve has absolutely failed as a regulator
[1:37:30.240 --> 1:37:31.600]  to deal with derivatives.
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:35.760]  Greenspan, bubble of Greenspan at the Fed in the 1990s,
[1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:37.680]  is the number one person responsible for these derivatives.
[1:37:37.680 --> 1:37:40.800]  But I'm saying arrest Paulson, arrest Bernanke,
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:42.320]  they certainly need to be arrested.
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:44.000]  And Greenspan, don't forget him.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.880]  And don't forget Wendy Graham, the wife of Phil Graham of the McCain campaign,
[1:37:48.880 --> 1:37:51.840]  when she was at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:54.320]  in the very end of the first Bush administration.
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:55.200]  What's on her list?
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:56.160]  Who needs to be arrested?
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:38:03.360]  Well, Paulson, Bernanke, Cox, Greenspan, Wendy Graham,
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:09.200]  probably Ruben and Summers from the Clinton administration.
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:10.480]  We want to be even-handed.
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:13.360]  What about the heads of these brokerage houses
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:15.040]  that we know have committed crime after crime?
[1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:16.000]  Uh, yes.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:21.440]  We have Jamie Dimon above all that JP Morgan Chase and so forth.
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:23.200]  Right, you can just go through the list.
[1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:28.880]  Fold of Bear Stearns, I'm sorry, of Lehman Brothers.
[1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:30.880]  And what's his name there?
[1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:32.160]  By the way, the head of Lehman Brothers
[1:38:32.160 --> 1:38:34.160]  made three billion bucks as CEO.
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:38.480]  And again, the main thing is putting these people in jail
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:41.200]  is a deterrent, but that won't help you.
[1:38:41.200 --> 1:38:43.040]  That won't prevent you from starving.
[1:38:43.040 --> 1:38:43.680]  In other words, you've got to put people on the table.
[1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:45.760]  By the way, folks, don't think that we can't do this.
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:46.880]  This is how big things start.
[1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:50.080]  Don't think that we've got to start talking,
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:52.960]  drumbeat, arrest them, arrest them, arrest them.
[1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:57.200]  Or they're going to continue.
[1:38:57.200 --> 1:38:59.040]  They're taking the bailout money already.
[1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:00.720]  The bailouts they got in the last year
[1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:02.080]  and using it to run around leverage in the markets.
[1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:03.520]  We have to put them in a situation
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:06.560]  where they'd be concerned about bail, not bailout.
[1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:07.200]  Absolutely.
[1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:09.040]  Okay, Webster, I want to take a few calls here.
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:11.360]  I want to get you back up, not late next week,
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:12.160]  but early next week.
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:12.480]  It's too much.
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:13.040]  True thing.
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:13.920]  Too much is happening.
[1:39:13.920 --> 1:39:16.240]  Chris and Alabama, you're on the air with Webster Darbley.
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:18.720]  Hello?
[1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:19.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:21.680]  Hello, this is Chris and I'll be Alabama.
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:23.120]  I'm on a meet-up group down here.
[1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:24.320]  And just to have some ideas,
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:25.840]  yesterday I had a bunch of our members
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:28.240]  practicing and doing everything they could
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:31.760]  our representatives here in Alabama, especially Sessions.
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:33.040]  And I think it actually had an effect.
[1:39:33.040 --> 1:39:34.480]  At least it didn't hurt.
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:35.760]  Sessions is now, I don't know if you know,
[1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:39.440]  he's come out fairly opposed to the bailout.
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.280]  It's mainly Republicans against it.
[1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:43.920]  The Democrats are hopping up and down
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:46.080]  for the criminal bailout.
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:46.880]  Said but true.
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:50.160]  And then Sessions is also the ranking Republican
[1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:50.960]  on the finance committee.
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:52.320]  So he's a fairly good guy to target.
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:54.000]  And I'm just, I'm putting a call out to anybody
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.400]  that's listening to the show to call Sessions,
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:39:58.480]  call his office in Washington, call his local office,
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:39:59.920]  send him faxes, do whatever you can do
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:01.920]  to kind of keep the heat up and let him know
[1:40:01.920 --> 1:40:04.800]  that we're thankful for his opposition so far,
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:06.160]  but we don't want to see him do a turnaround
[1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:07.760]  because it's the whole bait and switch thing there.
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:09.440]  Tell them we want a bailout,
[1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:11.280]  because see, they don't want to do nothing
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:12.880]  and they get blamed for a depression.
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:16.320]  Tell them, no, we want bailouts for the American people.
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:17.600]  We're going to pay for it anyways.
[1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:20.160]  And by the way, folks that are rich,
[1:40:20.160 --> 1:40:21.600]  we're not going to have an economy
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:24.800]  if we don't bail the working class blue collar
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:26.560]  and lower middle class people out.
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:28.800]  I mean, if there isn't some basic bailout
[1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:31.920]  for the American people, the real economy is dead.
[1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:34.000]  You can pack up and leave the United States
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:35.760]  and the depression that's going to ensue,
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:38.320]  Tarpley, you agree this, a depression in the U.S.,
[1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:40.480]  which we're now see forming,
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:42.400]  will suck in the rest of the world?
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:44.000]  Absolutely, it'll be a world crisis.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:45.680]  And remember, the problem you have in the U.S. now
[1:40:45.680 --> 1:40:48.080]  is that since industry was destroyed
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:49.760]  under Volcker, Carter,
[1:40:49.760 --> 1:40:52.240]  and the first trilateral commission regime,
[1:40:52.240 --> 1:40:55.600]  like Obama now, everything is now imported.
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:58.080]  So the standard of living necessary
[1:40:58.080 --> 1:40:59.840]  for human life in this country
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:02.320]  now depends on international export financing,
[1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:03.360]  which is going to be destroyed.
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:06.320]  We've been made to be dependent by design
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:09.360]  and a bunch of satanic, senile men are running it all.
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:10.240]  Chris, anything else?
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:11.600]  I appreciate your call. Anything else?
[1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:13.120]  Yeah, I'd just like to say,
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:14.640]  yeah, along that line, whoever does call,
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:16.320]  and yet try to mention some of the things
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:17.440]  that Webster's talking about,
[1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:19.120]  and then the Fed putting the Federal Reserve,
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:21.280]  putting them out of business
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:23.680]  and going back to the Treasury printing them out.
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:25.760]  And folks, what I'm saying is, and I appreciate your call,
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:28.400]  I am for moving towards the free market.
[1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:30.320]  I am more the Ron Paul School, not entirely.
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:32.240]  It's kind of a hybrid between the two,
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:35.120]  because I know that there are no utopias,
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:36.320]  it's a process,
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:41.840]  but we're like a man who has been in a life raft
[1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:47.200]  for two weeks, sunburned, lips, parts, cracks in our skin,
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:51.040]  living on subsistence rations who can't walk.
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:53.120]  And so that's why we have to have a bailout
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:54.160]  of the American people,
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:59.280]  because we may die on the shore if we don't have that.
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:00.640]  And so that's what I'm saying.
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:02.240]  Webster, you like that analogy?
[1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:03.840]  One good example, LIHEAP,
[1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:07.600]  the low-income heating assistance program
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:08.480]  of the federal government.
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:10.960]  It was supposed to be in the previous bailout,
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:13.760]  but Obama and Gouldsby said no to it.
[1:42:13.760 --> 1:42:15.600]  Now, any place where it gets cold,
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:17.440]  and that includes a lot of places,
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:21.200]  they're going to have people freezing to death this winter
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:23.440]  in the entire northern tier of the United States,
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:25.840]  because the LIHEAP money runs out,
[1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:28.320]  because there's not enough money in the LIHEAP fund
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:31.200]  in order to buy oil,
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:33.600]  the heating oil or kerosene or whatever people use.
[1:42:33.600 --> 1:42:33.920]  It's simple.
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:35.600]  They cannot argue with us.
[1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:38.240]  But before they bail out the international bankers,
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:39.280]  which shouldn't happen,
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:40.720]  but just for the sake of debate,
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:43.120]  they help the American people first.
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:46.640]  They get the economy going again with a real stimulus.
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:48.640]  You could take the 700 billion.
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:51.280]  If you want to have 700 billion, here's what you can do.
[1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:54.960]  15 billion dollars of infrastructure in every state.
[1:42:54.960 --> 1:42:56.640]  I mean, you'd have to sort of average it out,
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:42:58.240]  because some states are much bigger.
[1:42:58.240 --> 1:43:00.960]  But an average of 15 billion dollars per state,
[1:43:00.960 --> 1:43:02.480]  but obviously less for the small ones,
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:03.680]  more for the big ones.
[1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:07.440]  You could then begin to rebuild your railroad system
[1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:08.640]  and your highway system.
[1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:11.920]  And all of that localizes the money,
[1:43:11.920 --> 1:43:13.280]  and that goes into the economy.
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:14.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:17.040]  You would basically give that to state governments,
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:19.520]  and they would subcontract to the private sector.
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:21.680]  It's not a government program in that sense.
[1:43:21.680 --> 1:43:26.800]  It does not create the federal infrastructure corporation,
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:30.320]  except if the bankers refuse to do it.
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:31.120]  In other words,
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:33.520]  if you can't get something produced in the private sector,
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:36.240]  if they refuse, then you have to go ahead and do it anyway.
[1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:38.720]  You can fraud, so we just seize their assets.
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:41.520]  In this case, it's clear that infrastructure companies
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:43.360]  would be glad to get those contracts.
[1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:47.920]  And that would immediately begin to deal with mass immiseration,
[1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:51.280]  mass unemployment, and put a floor under the economy.
[1:43:51.280 --> 1:43:52.880]  All right, Brian in Illinois,
[1:43:52.880 --> 1:43:54.320]  you're on the air with Webster Tarpley.
[1:43:54.320 --> 1:43:55.120]  Go ahead.
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:55.680]  Hi, Alex.
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:56.480]  Hi, Webster.
[1:43:56.480 --> 1:43:58.160]  I'm a big fan of both of you.
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:43:58.400]  Hi.
[1:43:58.400 --> 1:43:59.040]  Thank you.
[1:43:59.040 --> 1:44:01.440]  I read Synthetic Terror, and I've seen Endgame,
[1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:02.880]  and it all makes sense to me.
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:06.960]  I just wanted to say that I thought last night,
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:08.080]  the little sock puppet,
[1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:15.760]  he got up there and threatened the American people and their Congress.
[1:44:16.800 --> 1:44:20.080]  I mean, basically, either bail Microny's out,
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:21.680]  or I'm going to burn your economy down.
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:24.720]  It's like Julius Caesar's family,
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:27.200]  you know, pay fire insurance premium,
[1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:28.560]  or I'm going to burn your house down.
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:32.160]  Look, I would say there was a real economic crisis,
[1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:34.480]  in other words, this is a real economic depression
[1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:35.840]  of unimaginable proportions.
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:40.640]  The point is, it may not be quite as rapid as he says.
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:42.720]  It might be, it's hard to say.
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:46.000]  But he's obviously doing this to try to stampede people.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:46.880]  It's similar to what he did at the bottom level.
[1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:49.120]  Oh, it's a clear financial terrorism.
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:51.200]  Paul Watson has a great article on prisonplanet.com.
[1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:53.520]  We need to get out to everybody where it breaks down.
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:55.280]  This is financial terrorism.
[1:44:55.280 --> 1:44:57.200]  It was a threat, Alex, a threat.
[1:44:57.200 --> 1:44:59.440]  It's an attempt to extort what he wants,
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:00.720]  and that, of course, at that point,
[1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:02.240]  you have to say no, don't do it.
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:04.000]  By the way, did you see the look on his face?
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:05.520]  He was so predatory.
[1:45:05.520 --> 1:45:08.080]  I mean, it was a, he is a real son of his.
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:09.440]  He has no power.
[1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:11.280]  He's just a walk-on part at this point.
[1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:12.320]  Oh, he's a cutout, he's a cutout.
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:14.800]  Power is now located in this principles committee,
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:16.160]  the Committee of Public Safety.
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:19.600]  That would be Paulson, Rice, Gates, Mullen.
[1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:20.800]  Those are the most obvious.
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:22.960]  And of course, Paulson wants to be named
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:24.720]  Economic Dictator of the United States.
[1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:26.960]  He wants to live in a juridical vacuum
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:29.680]  where he could presumably commit federal crimes,
[1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:32.160]  and nobody could touch him, because of the provision in this,
[1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:33.840]  in this three-page thing that they sent,
[1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:36.640]  right, saying that Paulson is henceforth untouchable
[1:45:36.640 --> 1:45:37.520]  and above the law.
[1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:39.120]  Now, that obviously couldn't fly,
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:39.840]  but that's what he was-
[1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:42.160]  No, I mean, it makes Paulson and the private banks
[1:45:43.840 --> 1:45:46.080]  divine right of kings, God Emperor.
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:50.400]  Robespierre, the uncorruptible, is above everybody else.
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:53.040]  But of course, Robespierre didn't end up too well.
[1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:56.160]  So the main thing now is to mobilize to oppose this,
[1:45:56.160 --> 1:45:58.160]  and remember, it will fail.
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:02.720]  You cannot maintain paper values for worthless derivatives.
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:06.880]  The intrinsic value of derivatives is zero or negative.
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:10.240]  If you remember the old little Abner comic strip by Al Cap,
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:11.920]  there was something called the Ras Bucknick.
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:14.000]  I think they meant the ruble in those days.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.240]  And they said the Ras Bucknick is a currency
[1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:18.880]  with negative value, because it's a nuisance,
[1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:21.120]  and you got to pay somebody to come and cart it away.
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:24.320]  You got to pay a sanitation man
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:26.160]  to come and get rid of it for you.
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:27.840]  Derivatives are of that nature.
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:29.760]  Derivatives have zero value.
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:32.480]  So anything that's paid for derivatives is theft.
[1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:35.680]  Yeah, they're only good earlier in the Ponzi scheme
[1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:37.280]  when schmucks are still taking them.
[1:46:38.240 --> 1:46:39.120]  Yes, I guess so.
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:41.360]  It's based on a mass delusion,
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:43.680]  and now that mass delusion is coming to an end.
[1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:45.600]  And again, if they want to be serious,
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.680]  again, when we make these arguments,
[1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:49.760]  these are basically killer amendments
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:51.520]  that clearly represent the public interest
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:53.280]  that ought to be attached to this bill.
[1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:55.120]  One of the things that could be attached to that bill
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:56.880]  is a wonderful killer amendment is
[1:46:56.880 --> 1:46:59.280]  ban all derivatives, outlaw derivatives.
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:00.720]  They were always illegal.
[1:47:00.720 --> 1:47:04.640]  We didn't have any derivatives to speak of 15, 16 years ago.
[1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:07.600]  It's all something that came under the Greenspan
[1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:08.640]  fed the Wendy Graham.
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:09.520]  No, I totally agree with you.
[1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:10.240]  Here we go.
[1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:11.680]  Let's thank you, Brian.
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:15.600]  Let's talk to Lindsey in Idaho.
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:17.040]  You're on the air with Webster Tarpley.
[1:47:17.040 --> 1:47:17.760]  Go ahead.
[1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:18.960]  Hello, Alex.
[1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:19.600]  Hi.
[1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:21.360]  Hey, I hope you're feeling better today.
[1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:22.160]  I am.
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:24.800]  Okay, I have two quick questions for Mr. Tarpley.
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:27.200]  I believe they're both related.
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:29.760]  I heard a couple of days ago on your show, Alex,
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:32.320]  somebody mentioned about annuities that people have
[1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:34.400]  that are issued either by insurance companies
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:35.840]  or I believe banks issue them.
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:39.040]  Yes, those are not projected by the FDIC.
[1:47:40.160 --> 1:47:42.560]  That's my question is, in other words,
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:44.240]  if the insurance company or the bank
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:46.800]  that issues the annuity to this person goes under,
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:48.720]  that it's not worth the paper it's written on.
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:49.760]  Is that correct?
[1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:52.800]  No, it's not, because you have the federal deposit
[1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:55.840]  insurance corporation that insures deposits
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:59.120]  up to $100,000 in commercial banks.
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:00.880]  And that's all.
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:01.360]  You've got it.
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:04.240]  And then you have AIG that was insuring the annuities.
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:05.200]  You understand?
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:06.720]  Look when you go into your bank.
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:07.920]  There's a sticker on the door.
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:09.920]  It says FDIC insured.
[1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:11.440]  If you have a credit union,
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:15.520]  there's a similar federal credit union insurance entity.
[1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:17.520]  And it's $50 billion has almost run out.
[1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:18.560]  They're asking for more now.
[1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:19.360]  Go ahead, Webster.
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:21.920]  So naturally, that could be replenished.
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:23.760]  And that's another part of the safety net
[1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:24.960]  that has to be replenished.
[1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:26.800]  And that's where money should go.
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:29.520]  You better believe they better give us our fiat crap
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:30.720]  when we go in for it.
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:34.480]  We're not even talking about you getting your money out.
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:38.560]  But the annuities, these are generally sold
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:39.920]  by insurance companies.
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:40.640]  They are iffy.
[1:48:40.640 --> 1:48:42.720]  Now you're going to find people on television saying,
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:45.360]  well, insurance companies are heavily regulated.
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:45.840]  That's fine.
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:49.520]  But in a real economic panic breakdown crisis
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:51.440]  of the type we're facing now,
[1:48:51.440 --> 1:48:54.640]  I think annuities are there in question.
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:56.160]  The other part with annuities is
[1:48:56.160 --> 1:48:58.080]  the reason you get sold these things
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:48:59.840]  is the guy who sells you the annuity
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:01.520]  makes a tremendous commission.
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:04.160]  They sell it to old people who don't know what they're doing
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:05.520]  because the guy who sells it to you
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:06.960]  makes more money on an annuity
[1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:08.880]  than anything else he could sell you.
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:10.400]  All right, let's stop right there.
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:13.520]  Matt, Scott, Bill, John, I'm going to get to you.
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:14.560]  But Webster's got to go.
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:15.920]  And I'm going to get some economic news.
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:18.320]  We got Ron Paul coming up here in just a few minutes.
[1:49:18.320 --> 1:49:19.440]  So everybody stay with us.
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:20.880]  I want to give Webster the last minute
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:24.080]  to plug his second book on Barack Obama.
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:26.320]  I carry his first book at infoworks.com.
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:28.240]  But you've got the last minute, Webster.
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:29.360]  Tell folks about the new book.
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:29.760]  Two books.
[1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:31.520]  One is Obama, the Postmodern Coup,
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:33.280]  the Making of a Manchurian Candidate.
[1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:35.280]  And that you should order straight from Alex.
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:38.560]  And I hope soon also Barack H. Obama,
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:40.320]  the Unauthorized Biography.
[1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:44.160]  And that is the story of Obama as a poverty pimp.
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:45.680]  Everybody wants to know,
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:48.160]  what does it mean to be a community organizer?
[1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:50.640]  Well, it means that you're working for a foundation
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:52.240]  like the Ford Foundation.
[1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:55.120]  Their task is to defend the existing social order,
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:57.840]  meaning the existing ruling class of finishers.
[1:49:57.840 --> 1:50:00.320]  He manages tribal reservations.
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:01.920]  That's what poverty pimps do.
[1:50:01.920 --> 1:50:06.080]  Poverty pimps take suffering people for wretches
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:08.560]  and turn them into dupes and a saleable committee
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:09.520]  political commodity.
[1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:10.880]  So spread the word.
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:13.120]  Obama is a poverty pimp.
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:14.640]  And it wants to be president.
[1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:15.520]  He's a divider.
[1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:16.160]  He's a splitter.
[1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:17.280]  And he works for the time.
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:20.720]  We've got Obama, the biography by Webster Tarpley,
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:22.400]  available at amazon.com.
[1:50:22.400 --> 1:50:23.680]  Give that title out again, Webster.
[1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:25.040]  Come on.
[1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:26.800]  Give the title of the book out again.
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:30.480]  It's Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography.
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:34.000]  Please buy it at amazon.com, selling that at noon.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:35.200]  All right, hold on, let me talk.
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:39.360]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow
[1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:40.960]  troops, I went to grounds here.
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:44.320]  And we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:47.120]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:49.760]  that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:51.280]  to tell their story.
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:57.440]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement
[1:50:57.440 --> 1:51:00.200]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:03.040]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:05.120]  as brave souls throughout the world
[1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:07.320]  take action against their global masters.
[1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:10.520]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:13.240]  He takes his hand off, and you hear it, three, two, one.
[1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:16.280]  And it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:19.320]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:23.160]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv,
[1:51:23.160 --> 1:51:25.360]  and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:28.280]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:51:28.280 --> 1:51:30.760]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[1:51:30.760 --> 1:51:35.440]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:37.240]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout
[1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:38.680]  of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[1:51:38.680 --> 1:51:40.600]  You may have no choice.
[1:51:40.600 --> 1:51:43.880]  Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over $6 trillion.
[1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:46.240]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages
[1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:48.440]  held by these two corporations.
[1:51:48.440 --> 1:51:50.320]  The part that most people don't realize
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:53.400]  is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:56.080]  on their 401Ks and IRAs.
[1:51:56.080 --> 1:51:57.960]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout
[1:51:57.960 --> 1:52:01.280]  with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:03.680]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA
[1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:05.160]  with gold and silver.
[1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:06.920]  Put your retirement money beyond the reach
[1:52:06.920 --> 1:52:09.000]  of government financiers today by calling
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:13.160]  1-866-323-5665.
[1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:16.080]  Safe-grow IRAs are just a phone call away.
[1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:19.720]  That's 1-866-323-5665.
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:21.720]  Microjim at Midas Resources can help
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:23.800]  you protect your retirement nest egg.
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:25.800]  Get informed and ask for our free report
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:28.720]  on the unseen fallout of the Fannie Freddie rescue.
[1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:32.600]  Call 1-866-323-5665.
[1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:38.600]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[1:52:38.600 --> 1:52:41.040]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably
[1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:42.120]  heard that lie.
[1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:43.560]  But what if I told you there's a way
[1:52:43.560 --> 1:52:46.760]  to know which way the market will go each week a whole week
[1:52:46.760 --> 1:52:47.720]  in advance?
[1:52:47.720 --> 1:52:50.480]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:53.240]  The guys over at eminiforcaster.com
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:55.080]  put out a weekly forecast line.
[1:52:55.080 --> 1:52:57.360]  They call it a G line, which forecasts
[1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:00.360]  the direction of the stock market a whole week in advance.
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:01.360]  Impossible?
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:04.080]  Head over to eminiforcaster.com and check out
[1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:06.560]  their forecast history to see for yourself.
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:10.800]  Eminiforcaster.com predicts the market one whole week in advance.
[1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:13.480]  It's simple to use and can give you the market edge
[1:53:13.480 --> 1:53:14.760]  you've been looking for.
[1:53:14.760 --> 1:53:16.600]  If you're an active trader in the markets,
[1:53:16.600 --> 1:53:19.440]  go directly to eminiforcaster.com.
[1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:23.920]  That's eminiforcaster.com right now for more information.
[1:53:23.920 --> 1:53:29.160]  Again, that's eminiforcaster.com.
[1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:31.560]  This is Rob at eminiforcaster.com,
[1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:32.840]  and I approve this message.
[1:53:32.840 --> 1:53:34.840]  Shh.
[1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:41.800]  I hear the train coming.
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:44.000]  It's rolling around the bend.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.800]  And I see the sun shines.
[1:53:46.800 --> 1:53:51.200]  I don't know when I'm stuck in fools in prison.
[1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:53.440]  And time keeps dragging on.
[1:53:57.040 --> 1:53:58.600]  But that train keeps rolling.
[1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:00.960]  We're steaming towards an interview with Ron Paul,
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:02.840]  coming up in the next 10 minutes.
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:07.320]  He's going to be calling in.
[1:54:07.320 --> 1:54:10.760]  Later, we'll be playing some clips of George Bush last night
[1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:13.160]  and going over what's happening.
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:16.840]  The United States is being imploded by the New World
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:18.720]  Order right now.
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:22.320]  And they've got the police state in place.
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:25.760]  They've got the FEMA camps in place.
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:27.840]  We need to have a loss of confidence
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:29.840]  in this criminal government.
[1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:32.840]  If we allow them to do what they want,
[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:34.000]  it's not the government anymore.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:35.360]  They will win.
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:37.680]  Now, I'm so busy, from coast to coast,
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:40.480]  I am doing other interviews.
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:42.360]  I got one with Texas Monthly tomorrow morning.
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:44.240]  I'm glad I just remembered that.
[1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:48.320]  All this stuff going on, National Geographic calling up,
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:50.000]  that I don't, I mean, I haven't even had time
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:51.680]  to get my finances properly in order.
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:56.200]  I'm just here at my machine gun on the front lines.
[1:54:56.200 --> 1:54:59.880]  The point is, I believe in gold and silver.
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:04.760]  And I believe that for people that still have paper assets,
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:08.400]  you're out of your mind if you don't move into gold and silver.
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:11.720]  And Ted Anderson, the owner of Genesis Communications Network,
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:14.680]  has been laying out this for years.
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:18.400]  He is able to get into gold when it is lower than it currently
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:23.360]  is to offer it to you at below spot and at near spot
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:25.280]  at just incredible deals.
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:27.520]  And, you know, Ted, give me your take
[1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:29.080]  on what's happening financially right now
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:30.680]  and then give folks today's offer.
[1:55:30.680 --> 1:55:32.640]  Well, it's just like Webster was saying,
[1:55:32.640 --> 1:55:34.880]  we're looking at an inflationary depression.
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:37.920]  If we finance this deal, if we don't do anything about it,
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:41.360]  we're gonna go into a deflationary depression.
[1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.200]  We just, we really need to get away
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:45.120]  from this Federal Reserve system.
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:46.400]  We need to get into honest money
[1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:48.280]  because this isn't gonna help.
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:52.520]  This $700 billion bailout is just the tip of the iceberg.
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:54.760]  And like Bloomberg said, it's gonna be closer
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:55.600]  to $5 trillion.
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:58.120]  Right now, the nation's debt is at $9 trillion.
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:01.000]  You add $5 trillion to it, you're almost doubling the debt.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.600]  Or I'm sorry, you're almost increasing it by 50%.
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:05.640]  That's just ludicrous.
[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:08.680]  I mean, to put that much new currency into the system
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:11.120]  is just gonna destroy the value of the money.
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:13.240]  Right now, without a question, yes, indeed.
[1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:15.840]  There are some really great buys right now, though.
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:19.480]  British sovereign right now is trading at $241 per coin.
[1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:21.640]  That's a couple bucks less than it was the day before.
[1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:23.440]  I think it's like $5 less.
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:25.280]  And then we have the Swiss francs
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:28.400]  and the French francs, that's stuff, $196.
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:31.080]  That's about a dollar and a half, $2 lower.
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:33.520]  And then we have the mercury dimes.
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:36.680]  And walking Liberty Haves, I can't even get anymore.
[1:56:36.680 --> 1:56:39.080]  We were talking about those earlier on last week
[1:56:39.080 --> 1:56:41.000]  and they're sold out, gone.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.680]  Now, the mercury dimes are starting to dwindle away
[1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:46.160]  and there's gonna be no supply there.
[1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:47.880]  See, people think that just because the gold
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:49.480]  and silver market comes down a little bit,
[1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:52.320]  that the supply is increasing in the physical markets.
[1:56:52.320 --> 1:56:54.880]  It's not, people buy this stuff and they put it away.
[1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:56.120]  They're not buying it to trade,
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.440]  they're putting it away and it's no longer on the market.
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:00.520]  So all this stuff that's in the physical market,
[1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:03.200]  and I was just drying up, I'm hearing it from everywhere,
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:05.240]  at all sources, that there's not enough available
[1:57:05.240 --> 1:57:08.840]  to meet just the demand from last week alone.
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:11.000]  It's crazy, Alex, right now at this time,
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.640]  if you, I mean, to watch what's going on,
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:15.440]  the only thing that's good that's coming out of this thing
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:18.800]  is John McCain suspended his campaign
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:20.200]  until they come to an agreement.
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:22.000]  I hope they never do.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:23.520]  Now, at least we won't have to listen to him anymore.
[1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:26.520]  Well, you Google gold shortage, silver shortage,
[1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:28.880]  they're trying to suppress it the price they can.
[1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:31.280]  It's gone up over a hundred bucks last week.
[1:57:31.280 --> 1:57:34.200]  And all they're gonna do is devalue the dollar.
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:35.720]  And the dollar's already a dead duck.
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:37.280]  They're just trying to pile more.
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:39.480]  The United States dollar, the Federal Reserve note
[1:57:39.480 --> 1:57:41.380]  that we're trading today is a dead duck.
[1:57:41.380 --> 1:57:42.820]  You said it just like, you know,
[1:57:42.820 --> 1:57:44.600]  that is just exactly right.
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:46.840]  What's gonna happen is that dollar's gonna fail.
[1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:50.360]  Call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:52.480]  Everybody knows that the dollar's toast now.
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:54.240]  There's nobody out there that thinks
[1:57:54.240 --> 1:57:55.840]  that this thing's gonna last.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:58:00.440]  Again, 800-686-2237, get out of the paper,
[1:58:00.440 --> 1:58:02.240]  get into gold because that's honest money
[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:04.360]  and been money for 6,000 years.
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:07.000]  The United States government can't mess with that.
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:10.280]  Absolutely, it's been performing at over 30% a year.
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:12.160]  All everything else has been in the negative.
[1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:13.000]  Stay there, Ted.
[1:58:16.200 --> 1:58:18.120]  Thank you for listening to GCA.
[1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:22.040]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:25.040 --> 1:58:27.240]  A day unlike any other in the long course
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:30.320]  of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:31.760]  against this country.
[1:58:31.760 --> 1:58:34.400]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:58:34.400 --> 1:58:35.960]  But who is the enemy?
[1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:36.800]  Bin Laden.
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:37.880]  This is his MO.
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:39.120]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:58:39.120 --> 1:58:41.120]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:43.200]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:58:43.200 --> 1:58:45.160]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:58:45.160 --> 1:58:48.200]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:58:48.200 --> 1:58:50.680]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[1:58:50.680 --> 1:58:55.040]  again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:58:55.040 --> 1:58:58.840]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:58:58.840 --> 1:59:00.680]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA,
[1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:02.640]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:59:02.640 --> 1:59:04.120]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:59:04.120 --> 1:59:05.720]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:07.800]  warnings in war games, the shadow government,
[1:59:07.800 --> 1:59:09.000]  and much, much more.
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:10.280]  Fabled enemies.

[1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:21.720]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:45.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:59:45.320 --> 1:59:52.320]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:59:52.320 --> 1:59:57.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:57.320 --> 1:59:59.320]  Well, we're into the third hour.
[1:59:59.320 --> 2:00:01.320]  Congressman Ron Paul scheduled to call in
[2:00:01.320 --> 2:00:03.320]  in the next five minutes.
[2:00:03.320 --> 2:00:05.320]  Sean, I forgot to ask you, are we calling him,
[2:00:05.320 --> 2:00:07.320]  or is he calling us?
[2:00:07.320 --> 2:00:09.320]  We have his number.
[2:00:09.320 --> 2:00:11.320]  You weren't told whether we call him or he calls us.
[2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:14.320]  Why don't you call and find out from the crew, okay?
[2:00:14.320 --> 2:00:16.320]  Let's nail that down right now.
[2:00:16.320 --> 2:00:18.320]  I scheduled it eight after.
[2:00:18.320 --> 2:00:20.320]  Okay, going back to Ted.
[2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:22.320]  Ted, give them the two gold coins
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:26.320]  you're offering at discount and the silver dimes.
[2:00:26.320 --> 2:00:28.320]  Explain those to people on what the price is.
[2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:31.320]  Sure, okay, British Sovereign's 241.
[2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:34.320]  It's a quarter-on-scole piece, and it is.
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:36.320]  It's a really good buy right at this time,
[2:00:36.320 --> 2:00:38.320]  and especially small gold.
[2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:40.320]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff that you can put in your,
[2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:43.320]  the sole of your shoe and walk away with and have his money.
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:45.320]  Back in the Weimar Republic, when that fell apart
[2:00:45.320 --> 2:00:47.320]  and the Nazis were coming in,
[2:00:47.320 --> 2:00:49.320]  and people were fleeing for their lives,
[2:00:49.320 --> 2:00:51.320]  they had to use the things that are of real wealth,
[2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:54.320]  and paper and Weimar Republic notes weren't doing it.
[2:00:54.320 --> 2:00:56.320]  You could have been a multi-millionaire,
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:00:59.320]  you'd have been wiped out, but if you had pieces of gold,
[2:00:59.320 --> 2:01:01.320]  diamonds, emeralds, jewelry,
[2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:03.320]  that kind of stuff was valuable.
[2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:05.320]  Obviously, this gold is going to be valuable.
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:07.320]  Gold was valuable when the Egyptians
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:10.320]  were living on this world, and it hasn't lost its value since.
[2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:14.320]  This United States currency was attached to gold through 1971,
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:18.320]  and didn't truly become fiat, you know, until after that point,
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:20.320]  and now you can see what's going on.
[2:01:20.320 --> 2:01:22.320]  You should have something that's real,
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:26.320]  something that's solid, something that you can actually use as money,
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:29.320]  if things really get bad, and we know they're gonna.
[2:01:29.320 --> 2:01:32.320]  And so there's no sense in even playing around with this thing.
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:34.320]  And another thing, Alex, you know,
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:36.320]  the reason why you have a credit implosion,
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:39.320]  I don't think a lot of people understand that money comes into existence
[2:01:39.320 --> 2:01:41.320]  through the creation of a loan.
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:43.320]  That's what the Federal Reserve is, it's a bank,
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:45.320]  and it lends us the money, and that's how it gets into the economy.
[2:01:45.320 --> 2:01:47.320]  But every time you see these defaults occurring,
[2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:50.320]  that means that that money that's been lent into the economy
[2:01:50.320 --> 2:01:53.320]  disappears into the same black hole that it was created from.
[2:01:53.320 --> 2:01:55.320]  It goes away.
[2:01:55.320 --> 2:01:57.320]  And that's why these banks collapsing,
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:01:59.320]  that's the real issue there.
[2:01:59.320 --> 2:02:01.320]  Allow these banks to collapse,
[2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:03.320]  and the money supply dries up to nothing,
[2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:05.320]  and there's no currency for commerce.
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:07.320]  That's why you don't have food in the grocery stores.
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:09.320]  It comes to a screeching halt.
[2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:11.320]  And we obviously need to get away from the system,
[2:02:11.320 --> 2:02:13.320]  because the people of the United States
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:15.320]  shouldn't be forced to take on debt
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:17.320]  in order to have economic commerce.
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:19.320]  That's a crazy, crazy notion
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:21.320]  that we'd even accept something like that,
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:23.320]  and yet it was sold to us in 1913.
[2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:25.320]  Now we're sitting here,
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:27.320]  the dollars imploding,
[2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:29.320]  and the companies
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:31.320]  that created these derivatives
[2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:33.320]  and all these different things,
[2:02:33.320 --> 2:02:35.320]  they're all falling apart,
[2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:37.320]  and it just doesn't make sense.
[2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:39.320]  It does not make sense to have your money in the bank.
[2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:41.320]  It doesn't make sense to have your money in annuities.
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:43.320]  It doesn't make sense to have your money
[2:02:43.320 --> 2:02:45.320]  in any of that paper stuff.
[2:02:45.320 --> 2:02:47.320]  Absolutely, we've got people calling up freaking out
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:49.320]  going, my annuity isn't insured,
[2:02:49.320 --> 2:02:51.320]  and they don't believe us,
[2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:53.320]  then they call their insurance company their annuity,
[2:02:53.320 --> 2:02:55.320]  and they go, yeah, it's not insured.
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:57.320]  So, yes, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:02:57.320 --> 2:02:59.320]  we're telling you the truth.
[2:02:59.320 --> 2:03:01.320]  Give the brokers a call,
[2:03:01.320 --> 2:03:05.320]  and they'll call the account 1-800-686-2237.
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:07.320]  I believe gold is only going to go up.
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:09.320]  All the market fundamentals state that
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:11.320]  as a law of finance, a law of currency,
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:13.320]  a law of economics.
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:15.320]  But bottom line, this is something that is real,
[2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:17.320]  this is something that is scarce,
[2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:19.320]  this is something that has intrinsic value anywhere in the world,
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:21.320]  800-686-2237.
[2:03:21.320 --> 2:03:23.320]  1-800-686-2237.
[2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:27.320]  The brokers are there until midnight.
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.320]  Ted, can you, because that's another great deal.
[2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:31.320]  These deals you've been offering have just been amazing.
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:33.320]  Can you hold that deal again to midnight tonight?
[2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:35.320]  I most certainly will give her higher,
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:37.320]  hell or high water. I don't care where gold goes.
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:39.320]  I'll hold it till midnight, and then we'll watch and see
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:41.320]  what happens tomorrow. We may even be able to do it for tomorrow.
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:43.320]  Briefly, gold's been all over the place today.
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:45.320]  I know it was up this morning. Where is it right now?
[2:03:45.320 --> 2:03:48.320]  Well, right now, the last time I looked, gold was at 8.7340.
[2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:50.320]  It had a high today of 8.9140.
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:52.320]  There's this gyration going on because they don't know
[2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:54.320]  what's going to happen in Congress.
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:56.320]  And the plunge protection team keeps dumping money trying to rally
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:03:58.320]  the stock market, which everybody knows now
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:00.320]  that happened right before 1929.
[2:04:00.320 --> 2:04:02.320]  Open discussion of depression and things.
[2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:04.320]  Call minus resources today.
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:06.320]  800-686-2237.
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:08.320]  Let me give you that number again, folks.
[2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:10.320]  I wouldn't procrastinate on this.
[2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:12.320]  I don't need to procrastinate.
[2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:14.320]  800-686-2237.
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:16.320]  Ted, thanks for
[2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:18.320]  popping in with us for this segment.
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:20.320]  I really appreciate
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:22.320]  all you're doing.
[2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:24.320]  Yeah, thanks. I'm going to go get back to shipping this stuff
[2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:26.320]  for way behind, so I've got to get on it, okay?
[2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:28.320]  It is crazy. All right, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:04:28.320 --> 2:04:30.320]  Stay with us.
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:40.320]  The stock market is crazy.
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:42.320]  The chemtrails are spraying us
[2:04:42.320 --> 2:04:44.320]  with their chemicals.
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:46.320]  It's time to think about what is important.
[2:04:46.320 --> 2:04:48.320]  Most forget just how important life is.
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:50.320]  Life change tea
[2:04:50.320 --> 2:04:52.320]  removes toxins, chemicals,
[2:04:52.320 --> 2:04:54.320]  parasites, and bacteria

[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:40.320]  Okay, we are skipping
[2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:42.320]  the next break in between
[2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:44.320]  votes in the house
[2:07:44.320 --> 2:07:46.320]  and doing his work and his lunch.

[2:07:52.320 --> 2:07:54.320]  the next break.
[2:07:54.320 --> 2:07:56.320]  Congressman Ron Paul
[2:07:56.320 --> 2:07:58.320]  joins us from a presidential candidate
[2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:00.320]  as libertarian then for president
[2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:02.320]  he has been
[2:08:02.320 --> 2:08:04.320]  for decades warning about
[2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:06.320]  how the international banking system would cause
[2:08:06.320 --> 2:08:08.320]  a world implosion.
[2:08:08.320 --> 2:08:10.320]  He's been intensely warning the last few months
[2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:12.320]  on national television and congress
[2:08:12.320 --> 2:08:14.320]  and here on this radio
[2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:16.320]  show and I specifically
[2:08:16.320 --> 2:08:18.320]  want to get from him the breakdown of what's happening
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:20.320]  this unprecedented power
[2:08:20.320 --> 2:08:22.320]  that the Treasury is asking for
[2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:24.320]  to make itself a private hedge fund
[2:08:24.320 --> 2:08:26.320]  and also to
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:28.320]  give themselves amnesty
[2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:30.320]  from any crimes that have been committed
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:32.320]  by the financial order. Paul Watson has the headline
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:34.320]  on PrisonPlanet.com
[2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:36.320]  Bush and McCain, blackmail America
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:38.320]  with economic terrorism.
[2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:40.320]  The two parties have circled the wagons
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:42.320]  they're saying you must
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:44.320]  give us unlimited power
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:46.320]  and $5 trillion according to Bloomberg's
[2:08:46.320 --> 2:08:48.320]  the real number. Bloomberg financial or
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:50.320]  the question will strike
[2:08:50.320 --> 2:08:52.320]  which itself is enough to send the markets
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:54.320]  into oblivion.
[2:08:54.320 --> 2:08:56.320]  So please Congressman Ron Paul
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:08:58.320]  who was just questioning Bernanke in the banking committee yesterday
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:09:00.320]  the only one asking real questions
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:02.320]  tell us what we're truly facing right now
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:04.320]  who are the culprits
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:06.320]  do people need to be brought to justice for this
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:08.320]  so that the criminal activity stops
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:10.320]  and what is your idea
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:12.320]  of a plan to try to
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:14.320]  avert what's happening versus
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:16.320]  their stick up bailout congressman.
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:18.320]  Well obviously it is very
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:20.320]  very serious and we've been warning about it
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:22.320]  as you have on your radio program
[2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:24.320]  and it's here but when they
[2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:26.320]  say that if we don't do exactly as they
[2:09:26.320 --> 2:09:28.320]  say and turn over more of our money
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:30.320]  and more of our liberties and exempt themselves
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:32.320]  from any court in the whole
[2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:34.320]  nation they're trying
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:36.320]  to intimidate us and
[2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:38.320]  stampede us into doing the wrong
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:40.320]  thing but they're also
[2:09:40.320 --> 2:09:42.320]  right when they say that if they don't
[2:09:42.320 --> 2:09:44.320]  do that we're going to have serious problems
[2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:46.320]  yes we are
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:48.320]  but we're going to have much more serious problems
[2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:50.320]  if we do
[2:09:50.320 --> 2:09:52.320]  we lost
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:54.320]  a call back
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:56.320]  okay classic there ladies and gentlemen
[2:09:56.320 --> 2:09:58.320]  we lost the congressman
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:00.320]  over the congressional phone
[2:10:00.320 --> 2:10:02.320]  line system
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:04.320]  and so we are calling congressman
[2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:06.320]  Ron Paul back right now
[2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:08.320]  on this key
[2:10:08.320 --> 2:10:10.320]  day with the
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:12.320]  decision of this nation being decided
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:14.320]  this is one of the most important
[2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:16.320]  crossroads in this country and in the world
[2:10:16.320 --> 2:10:18.320]  economic history
[2:10:18.320 --> 2:10:20.320]  will the criminals
[2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:22.320]  that have orchestrated this
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:24.320]  crisis that has nothing to do
[2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:26.320]  with the subprime loans that's less than 100
[2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:28.320]  billion of the trillions
[2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:30.320]  of junk and derivatives that are out there
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:32.320]  will they be
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:34.320]  able
[2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:36.320]  to orchestrate
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:38.320]  an expansion
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:40.320]  of their power out of the crisis they've committed
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:42.320]  to bring us even under greater
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:44.320]  control of the economic fascist
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:46.320]  or will
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:48.320]  the American people rally
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:50.320]  and say no and come up with a real plan
[2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:52.320]  to avert economic depression
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:54.320]  this is make it or break it
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:56.320]  right now and we are getting congressman
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:10:58.320]  Ron Paul back up on the line

[2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:04.320]  Bush and McCain blackmail America with economic terrorism
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:06.320]  excellent article by
[2:11:06.320 --> 2:11:08.320]  Paul Joseph Watson that everyone

[2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:14.320]  and others because it's key right now
[2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:16.320]  that the American people understand why and how
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:18.320]  this is happening and who the culprits are
[2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:20.320]  that is absolutely essential
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:22.320]  right now that
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:24.320]  that happen

[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:28.320]  polls and other polls
[2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:30.320]  under 30% or 28%
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:32.320]  in some polls lower in some others higher
[2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:34.320]  in others but never above 30%
[2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:36.320]  only 30%
[2:11:36.320 --> 2:11:38.320]  of the people are supporting
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:40.320]  this and
[2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:42.320]  that is very very exciting were we able to
[2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:44.320]  get the congressman back
[2:11:44.320 --> 2:11:46.320]  fantastic
[2:11:46.320 --> 2:11:48.320]  it is pandemonium
[2:11:48.320 --> 2:11:50.320]  up there at the capitol with the phone system
[2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:52.320]  and
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:54.320]  we will get the congressman
[2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:56.320]  back on with us lawmakers
[2:11:56.320 --> 2:11:58.320]  financial bailout agreement reached
[2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:00.320]  this is associated press
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:02.320]  this just came out 10 minutes ago
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:04.320]  warned a possible financial panic
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:06.320]  key republics and democrats reported agreement
[2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:08.320]  in principle Thursday on a 700
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:10.320]  billion bailout of the financial industry
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:12.320]  and said they would present it to bush
[2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:14.320]  administration hubs of a vote within days
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:16.320]  emerging from the two hour negotiation
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:18.320]  session senator chris dodd
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:20.320]  the senate
[2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:22.320]  the banking committee chairman said
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:24.320]  we are very confident
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:26.320]  that we can act expeditiously
[2:12:26.320 --> 2:12:28.320]  I now expect
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:30.320]  that we will indeed have a plan
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:32.320]  that can pass the house
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:34.320]  pass the senate and be signed
[2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:36.320]  by president said senator
[2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:38.320]  bob been at republic in utah
[2:12:38.320 --> 2:12:40.320]  the bipartisan consensus on the general
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:42.320]  discussion of the legislation was
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:44.320]  reported just hours before president bush
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:46.320]  was to host presidential contenders barack obama
[2:12:46.320 --> 2:12:48.320]  john mechanic congressional leaders at the white house
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:50.320]  for discussions on how to clear obstacles
[2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:52.320]  to the unpopular rescue plan
[2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:54.320]  it is unpopular
[2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:56.320]  so you have the establishment showing
[2:12:56.320 --> 2:12:58.320]  it is the establishment against the people
[2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:00.320]  giving dictatorial powers
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:02.320]  to these private interests
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:04.320]  he's back
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:06.320]  congressman had a little snafu there
[2:13:06.320 --> 2:13:08.320]  but at least we've got 10 minutes left with you
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:10.320]  please
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:12.320]  go back to where you were you were dealing
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:14.320]  with the very people
[2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:16.320]  that have engineered this are now saying give us
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:18.320]  unlimited blank check power
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:20.320]  yeah that's what they want
[2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:22.320]  and they don't want any review of any court
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:24.320]  so they want dictatorship
[2:13:24.320 --> 2:13:26.320]  they want to pass all the penalty
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:28.320]  and suffering on the
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:30.320]  average person on main street
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:32.320]  they talk about illiquid assets
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:34.320]  but what they should say is assets
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:36.320]  that have no value that everybody would know
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:38.320]  what they're talking about
[2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:40.320]  and they just want to dump the real assets on us
[2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:42.320]  and the bankers and others
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:44.320]  who are in special locations
[2:13:44.320 --> 2:13:46.320]  will pick up pieces of the good assets
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:48.320]  that were left over
[2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:50.320]  and we will have a depression or
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:52.320]  recession it's locked in place
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:54.320]  due to previous federal reserve action
[2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:56.320]  which is whether this will last
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:13:58.320]  one year or ten years
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:00.320]  in a full decade and we lose a lot of liberties
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:02.320]  in the meantime and I was saying earlier
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:04.320]  that it looks like
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:06.320]  from what I sense in this congress
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:08.320]  they're opting out for a decade
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:10.320]  plus of depression
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:12.320]  rather than saying
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:14.320]  well that's correct our ways, it's balanced the budget
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:16.320]  that's cut taxes, that's bring our troops home
[2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:18.320]  do all sensible things
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:20.320]  and what they're going to do is more the same
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:22.320]  of printing money and spending
[2:14:22.320 --> 2:14:24.320]  so that will prolong the agony
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:26.320]  and prevent the correction that is mandatory
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:28.320]  if we're talking about 13 to 15%
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:30.320]  real inflation compounded
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:32.320]  that is going to be devastating
[2:14:32.320 --> 2:14:34.320]  to people on fixed incomes but the general
[2:14:34.320 --> 2:14:36.320]  economy itself is already grinding
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:38.320]  to a halt right here in Texas
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:40.320]  even in Austin supposedly the most
[2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:42.320]  successful city in the country right now
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:44.320]  things are bad congressman
[2:14:44.320 --> 2:14:46.320]  you know
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:48.320]  we've had an addition over in our area
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:50.320]  along the coast we've had the addition
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:52.320]  of the hurricane problem
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:54.320]  but you know
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:56.320]  if you're starting to feel it there
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:14:58.320]  you can imagine what it must be like
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:00.320]  living in Nevada and California
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:02.320]  and Michigan all these other places
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:04.320]  have been suffering for a lot longer than a month
[2:15:04.320 --> 2:15:06.320]  or two, it's been a year or two
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:08.320]  and there's still a long way to go
[2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:10.320]  and my point is as long as you prevent
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:12.320]  and slow up the liquidation and the correction
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:14.320]  the longer the pain and the suffering
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:16.320]  lasts.
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:18.320]  What about criminal charges?
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:20.320]  The brokerage firms and hedge funds
[2:15:20.320 --> 2:15:22.320]  that put out all this fake paper
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:24.320]  knew they were engaging in criminal
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:26.320]  activities. I mean don't we need to have
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:28.320]  some investigations and then prosecutions
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:30.320]  so that Wall Street will
[2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:32.320]  stop engaging in these activities?
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:34.320]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it
[2:15:34.320 --> 2:15:36.320]  but probably if you wanted to prosecute
[2:15:36.320 --> 2:15:38.320]  the most guilty party
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:40.320]  you'd have to prosecute the
[2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:42.320]  Federal Reserve Board and the politicians
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:44.320]  who promote that because that's where the biggest fraud is
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:46.320]  Yes, that is true
[2:15:46.320 --> 2:15:48.320]  and this encourages fraud and deceit
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:50.320]  and all this speculation
[2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:52.320]  but I like to see that as local
[2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:54.320]  as possible. Just remember not too many years ago
[2:15:54.320 --> 2:15:56.320]  when Enron went bankrupt
[2:15:56.320 --> 2:15:58.320]  it motivated
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:00.320]  everybody to say hey there's not enough regulation
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:02.320]  so they passed Sarbanes-Oxley
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:04.320]  which was totally unnecessary and has hurt our economy
[2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:06.320]  and Enron
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:08.320]  people were prosecuted under Texas
[2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:10.320]  anti-fraud laws
[2:16:10.320 --> 2:16:12.320]  so some idea
[2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:14.320]  of getting the FBI involved
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:16.320]  that's sort of the FBI
[2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:18.320]  BATF
[2:16:18.320 --> 2:16:20.320]  approach and we don't like national police
[2:16:20.320 --> 2:16:22.320]  so yes they should be
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:24.320]  convicted and put in prison when they defrauded
[2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:26.320]  the public. So you want to see state
[2:16:26.320 --> 2:16:28.320]  grand juries in the proper role
[2:16:28.320 --> 2:16:30.320]  under the 10th Amendment that have very serious teeth
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:32.320]  and the crime is public
[2:16:32.320 --> 2:16:34.320]  so they need to convene grand juries right now.
[2:16:34.320 --> 2:16:36.320]  Yeah and we have
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:38.320]  proper authority for that and
[2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:40.320]  experience with it. I think the Enron case
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:42.320]  is a good example. Okay solutions
[2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:44.320]  I mean you have won
[2:16:44.320 --> 2:16:46.320]  world economic awards and they don't like to toot your horn
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:48.320]  but you've won some of the most prestigious awards
[2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:50.320]  out there
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:52.320]  by different
[2:16:52.320 --> 2:16:54.320]  schools of economics and of course
[2:16:54.320 --> 2:16:56.320]  the Austrian school of the von Miesen Institute
[2:16:56.320 --> 2:16:58.320]  what is your plan
[2:16:58.320 --> 2:17:00.320]  what would you do right now if you were the president
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:02.320]  and you were having this meeting coming up
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:04.320]  in a few hours what would Ron Paul do?
[2:17:04.320 --> 2:17:06.320]  Of course you have to
[2:17:06.320 --> 2:17:08.320]  realize that a constitutional
[2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:10.320]  president is cautious about not becoming
[2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:12.320]  a dictator himself
[2:17:12.320 --> 2:17:14.320]  I know what the policy should be
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:16.320]  of course and you have to find out what the congress
[2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:18.320]  is going to do but there would be a lot
[2:17:18.320 --> 2:17:20.320]  you could do you could probably
[2:17:20.320 --> 2:17:22.320]  I think the most important thing is
[2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:24.320]  is to send the message that we're going to quit
[2:17:24.320 --> 2:17:26.320]  living beyond our means and the president
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:28.320]  can set standard for that
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:30.320]  and he has the most control under the constitution
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:32.320]  on foreign policy he could say look
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:34.320]  no more wars we're done with these wars
[2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:36.320]  we're not going to take on the Russians
[2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:38.320]  we're not going to go take on people in
[2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:40.320]  Venezuela we're going to start talking
[2:17:40.320 --> 2:17:42.320]  to the Cubans and bring our troops
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:44.320]  home and save hundreds of billions of dollars
[2:17:44.320 --> 2:17:46.320]  that would send a powerful message
[2:17:46.320 --> 2:17:48.320]  that the dollar
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:50.320]  would respond to and actually oil prices
[2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:52.320]  would come down but then you have to get
[2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:54.320]  a consensus you have to get people to say
[2:17:54.320 --> 2:17:56.320]  look are you ready for a new
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:17:58.320]  idea about government something
[2:17:58.320 --> 2:18:00.320]  that the founders knew about government should be
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:02.320]  limited to protecting liberties we have to
[2:18:02.320 --> 2:18:04.320]  talk about unraveling
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:06.320]  the welfare state and
[2:18:06.320 --> 2:18:08.320]  we have to give up our ideas of
[2:18:08.320 --> 2:18:10.320]  world empire and that is
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:12.320]  the most important thing a president could do
[2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:14.320]  in the meantime the policy ought to be
[2:18:14.320 --> 2:18:16.320]  shrink the size of the government
[2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:18.320]  decrease the regulation
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:20.320]  work toward the sound money
[2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:22.320]  remove the authority of the Fed to create
[2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:24.320]  money out of thin air and
[2:18:24.320 --> 2:18:26.320]  get tax reduction we need
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:28.320]  we need radical tax reduction they want more
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:30.320]  money in the economy well
[2:18:30.320 --> 2:18:32.320]  if we didn't have an income tax and did away with
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:34.320]  the spending would all be a lot richer
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:36.320]  and all of a sudden I think we would thrive
[2:18:36.320 --> 2:18:38.320]  in a short period of time I would permit
[2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:40.320]  the liquidation of debt to continue
[2:18:40.320 --> 2:18:42.320]  all right congressman we have
[2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:44.320]  the AP reporting that
[2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:46.320]  financial bailout agreement has been reached
[2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:48.320]  basically they're going along with almost all of
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:50.320]  what Paulson called for in his new
[2:18:50.320 --> 2:18:52.320]  financial imperium or failing
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:54.320]  forward getting
[2:18:54.320 --> 2:18:56.320]  back to prosecution I mean if you're saying
[2:18:56.320 --> 2:18:58.320]  go after the Fed governors you're talking about
[2:18:58.320 --> 2:19:00.320]  Alan Greenspan the former chairman you're talking
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:02.320]  about helicopter Ben who are you talking about
[2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:04.320]  all of them but
[2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:06.320]  you know in a way that symbolic gesture
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:08.320]  because they are people
[2:19:08.320 --> 2:19:10.320]  who have been put in office you know
[2:19:10.320 --> 2:19:12.320]  through the system and the president I don't
[2:19:12.320 --> 2:19:14.320]  think we get anywhere on there but
[2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:16.320]  morally speaking they're the culprits
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:18.320]  and you know in
[2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:20.320]  in 1792 when we had our first corny jack
[2:19:20.320 --> 2:19:22.320]  they said anybody to counterfeit
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:24.320]  money deserve it death penalty
[2:19:24.320 --> 2:19:26.320]  that's what they they thought because they hated
[2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:28.320]  inflation and here we are
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:30.320]  we endorse inflation legalize it
[2:19:30.320 --> 2:19:32.320]  and put you know how long was Alan
[2:19:32.320 --> 2:19:34.320]  Greenspan considered the
[2:19:34.320 --> 2:19:36.320]  the nobody would say boo to him
[2:19:36.320 --> 2:19:38.320]  and here he set up the whole stage of this
[2:19:38.320 --> 2:19:40.320]  whole problem that we have and really he's
[2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:42.320]  just a little man behind the curtain
[2:19:42.320 --> 2:19:44.320]  running the scam only about four minutes left
[2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:46.320]  with you congressman I wanted to get into
[2:19:46.320 --> 2:19:48.320]  the army times last week announcing
[2:19:48.320 --> 2:19:50.320]  regular combat brigades to be rotated
[2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:52.320]  in for crowd control
[2:19:52.320 --> 2:19:54.320]  with microwave guns non lethal weapons
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:19:56.320]  we see
[2:19:56.320 --> 2:19:58.320]  the federal expansion
[2:19:58.320 --> 2:20:00.320]  you know preparing for social
[2:20:00.320 --> 2:20:02.320]  breakdown so you and many others
[2:20:02.320 --> 2:20:04.320]  and 70% of the
[2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:06.320]  American people in major polls are against the
[2:20:06.320 --> 2:20:08.320]  bailout but instead the establishment
[2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:10.320]  in congress and both parties
[2:20:10.320 --> 2:20:12.320]  are saying we don't care and we're going to
[2:20:12.320 --> 2:20:14.320]  go ahead and go with this
[2:20:14.320 --> 2:20:16.320]  handover to the private banksters after they've
[2:20:16.320 --> 2:20:18.320]  committed all these crimes are you concerned
[2:20:18.320 --> 2:20:20.320]  about
[2:20:20.320 --> 2:20:22.320]  about civil unrest if a depression
[2:20:22.320 --> 2:20:24.320]  comes or if this deepens and
[2:20:24.320 --> 2:20:26.320]  and you know how do we counter that
[2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:28.320]  when they start activating regular army
[2:20:28.320 --> 2:20:30.320]  groups in the united states
[2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:32.320]  well it's going to be tough because
[2:20:32.320 --> 2:20:34.320]  that's the movement and you know
[2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:36.320]  they tell you what their attitude is
[2:20:36.320 --> 2:20:38.320]  with that provision in the
[2:20:38.320 --> 2:20:40.320]  poulsen's bill
[2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:42.320]  which says we're going from the courts
[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:44.320]  we don't even want the courts to look at
[2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:46.320]  this they may modify that language but you
[2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:48.320]  know what their attitude is
[2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:50.320]  and they want
[2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:52.320]  to be lawless they don't want to be held
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:54.320]  accountable and
[2:20:54.320 --> 2:20:56.320]  that's why it is extremely dangerous
[2:20:56.320 --> 2:20:58.320]  I talk about the economic dangers
[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:00.320]  and we all should be concerned because we want
[2:21:00.320 --> 2:21:02.320]  a high standard of living but
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:04.320]  ultimately the only thing you count is
[2:21:04.320 --> 2:21:06.320]  our freedom you know we could be
[2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:08.320]  very very poor we could wipe out a lot
[2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:10.320]  of wealth in this country but if we had
[2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:12.320]  our freedoms in the market and found money
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:14.320]  we would all go back to work quickly
[2:21:14.320 --> 2:21:16.320]  we would help our neighbors and our friends and we
[2:21:16.320 --> 2:21:18.320]  would be wealthy in a short period of time
[2:21:18.320 --> 2:21:20.320]  so that's why what you're talking
[2:21:20.320 --> 2:21:22.320]  about are we going to have martial law
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:24.320]  or are we going to have more freedoms
[2:21:24.320 --> 2:21:26.320]  and the more problems that we have
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:28.320]  the more likely is that we're going to have
[2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:30.320]  martial law so I do think they
[2:21:30.320 --> 2:21:32.320]  anticipate and make plans for these things
[2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:34.320]  in closing
[2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:36.320]  congressman you
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:38.320]  have you know to tell the fact that
[2:21:38.320 --> 2:21:40.320]  that government is always co-opted by
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:42.320]  private corporations and corrupt systems
[2:21:42.320 --> 2:21:44.320]  and no matter how much good you try to put into
[2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:46.320]  it it always turns out you know becoming corrupted
[2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:48.320]  but at the same time people losing their
[2:21:48.320 --> 2:21:50.320]  homes companies falling
[2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:52.320]  apart
[2:21:52.320 --> 2:21:54.320]  the real economy being raided by wall street
[2:21:54.320 --> 2:21:56.320]  right now with the previous bailout money
[2:21:56.320 --> 2:21:58.320]  you know banning the shorting only on
[2:21:58.320 --> 2:22:00.320]  themselves but then turning the dogs loose
[2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:02.320]  on the real economy
[2:22:02.320 --> 2:22:04.320]  I know you're against the bailout
[2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:06.320]  of the bankers
[2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:08.320]  is it a lesser evil to have
[2:22:08.320 --> 2:22:10.320]  some type of bailout
[2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:12.320]  of the infrastructure
[2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:14.320]  itself because we're like
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:16.320]  an emaciated person that's been
[2:22:16.320 --> 2:22:18.320]  thrown up on the shore or
[2:22:18.320 --> 2:22:20.320]  what do you say to that
[2:22:20.320 --> 2:22:22.320]  what do you mean by infrastructure
[2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:24.320]  are you talking about the material infrastructure
[2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:26.320]  roads highways and things
[2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:28.320]  well all of it and then people losing their houses
[2:22:28.320 --> 2:22:30.320]  I mean if we're going to have a bailout
[2:22:30.320 --> 2:22:32.320]  shouldn't it be of the American people
[2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:34.320]  I mean I know that's bad too but isn't that better
[2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:36.320]  I wouldn't endorse that but I also
[2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:38.320]  always have a program of transition
[2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:40.320]  if money is to be spent
[2:22:40.320 --> 2:22:42.320]  we have to pay for it
[2:22:42.320 --> 2:22:44.320]  just recently we had a disaster relief program
[2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:46.320]  and I voted against it
[2:22:46.320 --> 2:22:48.320]  I don't have the money but I'm not against
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:50.320]  doing some of that but I'm against
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:52.320]  building the deficit to do it I would cut
[2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:54.320]  you know if we need 10 billion dollars
[2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:56.320]  for survival reasons
[2:22:56.320 --> 2:22:58.320]  here infrastructure
[2:22:58.320 --> 2:23:00.320]  I would cut 20 billion dollars overseas
[2:23:00.320 --> 2:23:02.320]  put 10 against the deficit and use 10
[2:23:02.320 --> 2:23:04.320]  here at home and that's not
[2:23:04.320 --> 2:23:06.320]  perfect but it's so much
[2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:08.320]  better than continue to spend money
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:10.320]  and expand our programs
[2:23:10.320 --> 2:23:12.320]  overseas and getting ourselves into so much trouble
[2:23:12.320 --> 2:23:14.320]  so the lesser of two evils
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:16.320]  well I certainly agree with you
[2:23:16.320 --> 2:23:18.320]  there
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:20.320]  this is the final question congressman
[2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:22.320]  they're saying that they're going to go ahead
[2:23:22.320 --> 2:23:24.320]  and go with the bailout
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:26.320]  do you think that's going to fall apart
[2:23:26.320 --> 2:23:28.320]  or do you think the scaremongering
[2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:30.320]  by both parties leaders
[2:23:30.320 --> 2:23:32.320]  of imminent depression is going
[2:23:32.320 --> 2:23:34.320]  to get this rammed through
[2:23:34.320 --> 2:23:36.320]  and then down the road
[2:23:36.320 --> 2:23:38.320]  how bad do you think this will accelerate
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:40.320]  the hyperinflation
[2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:42.320]  well it's going to be inflationary
[2:23:42.320 --> 2:23:44.320]  but it might calm the markets
[2:23:44.320 --> 2:23:46.320]  for a little while but it will not solve the problem
[2:23:46.320 --> 2:23:48.320]  it just delays the inevitable
[2:23:48.320 --> 2:23:50.320]  but yesterday I would have said
[2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:52.320]  boy there's no way they can get these votes
[2:23:52.320 --> 2:23:54.320]  today you know I'm twisting
[2:23:54.320 --> 2:23:56.320]  and giving everybody benefits
[2:23:56.320 --> 2:23:58.320]  and boosting this package up
[2:23:58.320 --> 2:24:00.320]  and passing out more funds
[2:24:00.320 --> 2:24:02.320]  it looks like they're going to defy
[2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:04.320]  the American people
[2:24:04.320 --> 2:24:06.320]  and it tells you how close the two parties are
[2:24:06.320 --> 2:24:08.320]  because you see
[2:24:08.320 --> 2:24:10.320]  all of a sudden you don't see McCain
[2:24:10.320 --> 2:24:12.320]  and Obama fighting over this
[2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:14.320]  they both endorse
[2:24:14.320 --> 2:24:16.320]  these bailout principles
[2:24:16.320 --> 2:24:18.320]  and you see Clinton endorsing basically McCain
[2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:20.320]  I mean it's a love fest
[2:24:20.320 --> 2:24:22.320]  so that tells you that
[2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:24.320]  they are in charge and you know
[2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:26.320]  that we've complained a lot about the political system
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:28.320]  and why anybody who truly
[2:24:28.320 --> 2:24:30.320]  objects to the establishment
[2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:32.320]  can't get very far in today's establishment
[2:24:32.320 --> 2:24:34.320]  is that why you're endorsing Chuck Baldwin
[2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:36.320]  over the Republican candidate
[2:24:36.320 --> 2:24:38.320]  well I've rejected
[2:24:38.320 --> 2:24:40.320]  the two party system the two candidates
[2:24:40.320 --> 2:24:42.320]  so yes I did pick Chuck over
[2:24:42.320 --> 2:24:44.320]  Congressman I think this could end up destroying
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:46.320]  the new world order globalist system
[2:24:46.320 --> 2:24:48.320]  I think they've overreached
[2:24:48.320 --> 2:24:50.320]  and this is badly coordinated
[2:24:50.320 --> 2:24:52.320]  and I think this is finally going to destroy the people's confidence
[2:24:52.320 --> 2:24:54.320]  in this giant
[2:24:54.320 --> 2:24:56.320]  you know mega state do you agree with that
[2:24:56.320 --> 2:24:58.320]  I think that's a possibility because I think they get
[2:24:58.320 --> 2:25:00.320]  to the point where they think they're like
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:02.320]  God and they can control everything
[2:25:02.320 --> 2:25:04.320]  and they don't realize the market really is
[2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:06.320]  more powerful than all the bankers
[2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:08.320]  and all the politicians the market's rule
[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:10.320]  it just takes a time
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:12.320]  and they're sort of not
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:14.320]  who's going to be the victims and all
[2:25:14.320 --> 2:25:16.320]  they think they have control but ultimately
[2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:18.320]  you know it's the underground economy
[2:25:18.320 --> 2:25:20.320]  that is the real economy
[2:25:20.320 --> 2:25:22.320]  so I think they could overstep themselves
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:24.320]  and hopefully we
[2:25:24.320 --> 2:25:26.320]  can come out with a better world afterwards
[2:25:26.320 --> 2:25:28.320]  well we're really blessed to have you up there watching
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:30.320]  the banking crime syndicate
[2:25:30.320 --> 2:25:32.320]  they're on the house banking committee congressman
[2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:34.320]  and we just want to thank you
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:36.320]  for the plug some of the websites
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:38.320]  and the
[2:25:38.320 --> 2:25:40.320]  book or any other information
[2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:42.320]  or any congressional websites
[2:25:42.320 --> 2:25:44.320]  that people might want to check into
[2:25:44.320 --> 2:25:46.320]  okay if you go to runpaul.org
[2:25:46.320 --> 2:25:48.320]  and go to all my websites but the most
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:50.320]  significant right now is campaign for liberty
[2:25:50.320 --> 2:25:52.320]  either one will find me
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:54.320]  I'm found very easily on the internet
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:56.320]  sir thank you for your time take care
[2:25:56.320 --> 2:25:58.320]  okay thank you very much
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:00.320]  there goes congressman Ron Paul
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:02.320]  spending 20 minutes
[2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:04.320]  with us today we appreciate
[2:26:04.320 --> 2:26:06.320]  him taking the time out to do that
[2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:08.320]  in his busy schedule I know
[2:26:08.320 --> 2:26:10.320]  we have loaded phone lines here
[2:26:10.320 --> 2:26:12.320]  when you hear a caller hang up
[2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:14.320]  means you can get involved on air
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:16.320]  1-800-259-9231
[2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:20.320]  I'm going to go to your calls but I'm going to go to them
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:22.320]  in rapid succession for me that means
[2:26:22.320 --> 2:26:24.320]  extremely slow but
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:26.320]  on this call list John
[2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:28.320]  who is up next
[2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:30.320]  Matt in the good old UK
[2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:32.320]  you're on the air go ahead
[2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:34.320]  thank you sir and I hope you're feeling
[2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:36.320]  a lot better by the way
[2:26:36.320 --> 2:26:38.320]  as I say I've enjoyed the topic today
[2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:40.320]  yeah I just want to mention very quickly
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:42.320]  I know you've got a lot of calls
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:44.320]  to your show
[2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:46.320]  I watched the bus thing
[2:26:46.320 --> 2:26:48.320]  yesterday in the UK
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:50.320]  and I just want to mention
[2:26:50.320 --> 2:26:52.320]  that basically where I live
[2:26:52.320 --> 2:26:54.320]  in the UK there's a lot of houses being
[2:26:54.320 --> 2:26:56.320]  repossessed and what the councils are doing
[2:26:56.320 --> 2:26:58.320]  is obviously the ones that have been
[2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:00.320]  repossessed they're going to privatize
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:02.320]  and rent them out
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:04.320]  very very scary times
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:06.320]  explain that again
[2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:08.320]  they're going to privatize them
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:10.320]  who is going to privatize them
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:12.320]  the local councils
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:14.320]  or the councils in the UK
[2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:16.320]  where I live in the UK has got the highest
[2:27:16.320 --> 2:27:18.320]  repossession rate in the UK
[2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:20.320]  and what they're going to do is
[2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:22.320]  all those that have been repossessed
[2:27:22.320 --> 2:27:24.320]  the councils are going to buy them off the government
[2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:26.320]  and obviously rent them out
[2:27:26.320 --> 2:27:28.320]  I saw some plans of that
[2:27:28.320 --> 2:27:30.320]  so you have government engaging in predatory
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:32.320]  activity at every level
[2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:34.320]  and of course the United States has said
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:36.320]  it's going to quote bail out the British banks
[2:27:36.320 --> 2:27:38.320]  they're talking about 200 billion pounds
[2:27:38.320 --> 2:27:40.320]  or that's 400 million plus dollars
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:42.320]  just in the UK
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:44.320]  with your 70 million or 80 million
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:46.320]  people over there
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:48.320]  I mean think about the magnitude
[2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:50.320]  of this
[2:27:50.320 --> 2:27:52.320]  and so the people pay for the
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:54.320]  bailout and then they get their
[2:27:54.320 --> 2:27:56.320]  houses taken and then government takes
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:58.320]  your tax money locally
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:00.320]  and buys the houses again
[2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:02.320]  so really the banks are being paid
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:04.320]  that's just like in the US they're saying
[2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:06.320]  top dollar will be paid
[2:28:06.320 --> 2:28:08.320]  for the junk securities and the derivatives
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:10.320]  and then the good homes and the bad homes
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:12.320]  all of it buy the taxpayer
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:14.320]  top dollar and then we get
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:16.320]  to have our houses taken
[2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:18.320]  I mean it's just crime
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:20.320]  on crime on crime
[2:28:20.320 --> 2:28:22.320]  and just a mindless public
[2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:24.320]  you know no idea what's even going on
[2:28:24.320 --> 2:28:26.320]  they're just absolutely
[2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:28.320]  like people have had their ears gouged out
[2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:30.320]  their eyes gouged out, their tongues cut out
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:32.320]  beaten in the head with hammers
[2:28:32.320 --> 2:28:34.320]  just drooling on the side of the road
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:36.320]  just worshiping black ski masks
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:38.320]  worshiping cameras, worshiping FEMA camps
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:40.320]  I mean I feel sorry for people
[2:28:40.320 --> 2:28:42.320]  I mean the people in the UK
[2:28:42.320 --> 2:28:44.320]  are blinded by this because
[2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:46.320]  the mortgage interest rate is going to buy
[2:28:46.320 --> 2:28:48.320]  8, 9 even 10%
[2:28:48.320 --> 2:28:50.320]  in the UK and people just can't afford it
[2:28:50.320 --> 2:28:52.320]  I mean like I don't know what it's like
[2:28:52.320 --> 2:28:54.320]  in the US for like we have like a minimum wage
[2:28:54.320 --> 2:28:56.320]  it's like 5 to 52 UK
[2:28:56.320 --> 2:28:58.320]  pounds I don't know what that is
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:00.320]  in US dollars but people just can't
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:02.320]  live on this minimum wage and then we
[2:29:02.320 --> 2:29:04.320]  are PM saying that they've created
[2:29:04.320 --> 2:29:06.320]  3 million new jobs, 3 million new jobs where
[2:29:06.320 --> 2:29:08.320]  you know amazing
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:10.320]  Matt got a jump thank you for the call
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:12.320]  Scott, Bill, John, Michael stay with us
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:22.320]  we're on the march, the empire's on the run
[2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:48.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:52.320]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed
[2:29:52.320 --> 2:29:54.320]  the seeds of despotism to grow
[2:29:54.320 --> 2:29:56.320]  at our own door
[2:29:56.320 --> 2:29:58.320]  7 years after the attacks of September 11
[2:29:58.320 --> 2:30:00.320]  a global awakening has taken place
[2:30:00.320 --> 2:30:02.320]  An inside job
[2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:04.320]  How dare you
[2:30:08.320 --> 2:30:10.320]  If you know that there's treason going on
[2:30:10.320 --> 2:30:12.320]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:14.320]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:16.320]  and if the government has not told the truth
[2:30:16.320 --> 2:30:18.320]  in 5 years we will be here
[2:30:18.320 --> 2:30:20.320]  on the 10th anniversary of London

[2:30:30.320 --> 2:30:32.320]  everything goes right?
[2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:34.320]  First I get the best parking space at work

[2:30:36.320 --> 2:30:38.320]  lovely Rachel
[2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:40.320]  and today I gave a killer presentation in
[2:30:40.320 --> 2:30:42.320]  Sydney, finalized a contract in London
[2:30:42.320 --> 2:30:44.320]  and demoed our new product in Boston
[2:30:44.320 --> 2:30:46.320]  online from my desk with WebEx
[2:30:46.320 --> 2:30:48.320]  WebEx lets me take
[2:30:48.320 --> 2:30:50.320]  meetings and give presentations from my desk
[2:30:50.320 --> 2:30:52.320]  I just talked to clients on the phone
[2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:54.320]  and they watch what's happening on my desktop
[2:30:54.320 --> 2:30:56.320]  from their desktop
[2:30:56.320 --> 2:30:58.320]  so I can travel the world and still be here

[2:31:32.320 --> 2:31:34.320]  Wake up and smell the fascism
[2:31:34.320 --> 2:31:36.320]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry
[2:31:36.320 --> 2:31:38.320]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand George?
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:40.320]  It's not who votes accounts
[2:31:40.320 --> 2:31:42.320]  It's who counts the votes
[2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:44.320]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice
[2:31:44.320 --> 2:31:46.320]  sometimes it seems the only thing

[2:32:48.320 --> 2:32:52.320]  you could live to 103
[2:32:52.320 --> 2:32:54.320]  103 is forever
[2:32:54.320 --> 2:32:56.320]  when you're just a little kid
[2:32:56.320 --> 2:32:58.320]  so
[2:32:58.320 --> 2:33:00.320]  Cyrus Jones lives forever
[2:33:00.320 --> 2:33:02.320]  Grave Digger
[2:33:02.320 --> 2:33:04.320]  Grave Digger
[2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:06.320]  when you dig my grave
[2:33:06.320 --> 2:33:10.320]  Man, Willie Nelson's voice is soothing
[2:33:10.320 --> 2:33:14.320]  so I can feel
[2:33:14.320 --> 2:33:16.320]  By the way, just a program note
[2:33:16.320 --> 2:33:18.320]  I'm going to announce tomorrow or Monday
[2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:20.320]  We've already judged
[2:33:20.320 --> 2:33:22.320]  the essays, I'm trying to judge the videos
[2:33:22.320 --> 2:33:24.320]  We want to try to be fair about this
[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:26.320]  We already had one wave of contests
[2:33:26.320 --> 2:33:28.320]  for $3,000
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:30.320]  a 2,000 prize and a 1,000 prize
[2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:32.320]  those won a month or so ago
[2:33:32.320 --> 2:33:34.320]  the second wave
[2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:36.320]  it's been a few weeks since that closed out
[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:38.320]  and we got a couple hundred essays of each
[2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:40.320]  hundreds of videos and we're just
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:42.320]  all of us been watching, reading, trying to pick
[2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:44.320]  the best winners
[2:33:44.320 --> 2:33:46.320]  so we're going to get on to that
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:48.320]  also Willie Nelson was on with us a few months ago
[2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:50.320]  a month and a half ago
[2:33:50.320 --> 2:33:52.320]  and a caller said, hey, y'all have a 9-11 truth rally
[2:33:52.320 --> 2:33:54.320]  and he said, I do that in a minute
[2:33:54.320 --> 2:33:56.320]  and I said, well, you really want to do it
[2:33:56.320 --> 2:33:58.320]  and he goes, yeah, set it up
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:00.320]  and then at the dates when he was going to be in Texas
[2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:02.320]  he's not here that much anymore
[2:34:02.320 --> 2:34:04.320]  it was just conflicts and he said, look
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:06.320]  just come to one of my concerts
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:08.320]  and I'll have you and Jesse Ventura speak there
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:10.320]  and I had no idea how special this concert is
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:12.320]  and who else is going to be there
[2:34:12.320 --> 2:34:14.320]  and so
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:16.320]  Willie said
[2:34:16.320 --> 2:34:18.320]  I mean, by the time he announced it
[2:34:18.320 --> 2:34:20.320]  this concert was already sold out
[2:34:20.320 --> 2:34:22.320]  and so I kind of like, well, I can't
[2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:24.320]  have a bunch of people come to it
[2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:26.320]  we're going to have a free one
[2:34:26.320 --> 2:34:28.320]  but we're going to stream it live over the web
[2:34:28.320 --> 2:34:30.320]  it'll be at infowars.com for free
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:32.320]  and we've already been out there
[2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:34.320]  and wired all that up
[2:34:34.320 --> 2:34:36.320]  out there with his people and I'm just going to leave it at that
[2:34:36.320 --> 2:34:38.320]  and I have been so busy
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:40.320]  I haven't even called Ventura back
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:42.320]  he's set, he's coming into town in his RV
[2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:44.320]  last time I talked to him was like three weeks ago
[2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:46.320]  I've been too busy, I'm going to call them tomorrow
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:48.320]  and it's all set up, it's a done deal
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:50.320]  but I'm just going to
[2:34:50.320 --> 2:34:52.320]  get them both set up, come on and promote the event
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:54.320]  on air in the next month
[2:34:54.320 --> 2:34:56.320]  and a few weeks
[2:34:56.320 --> 2:34:58.320]  I'll announce where it's set and where it's going to be
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:00.320]  but just know this, in late October
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:02.320]  you'll be able to watch it for free
[2:35:02.320 --> 2:35:04.320]  on infowars.com
[2:35:04.320 --> 2:35:06.320]  I'm going to pay for it and stream it out
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:08.320]  and do the whole deal
[2:35:08.320 --> 2:35:10.320]  Willie was offering to hook up his own stuff and do it
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:12.320]  and I said, look, I don't want to bug you
[2:35:12.320 --> 2:35:14.320]  and frankly with all the
[2:35:14.320 --> 2:35:16.320]  economic stuff that's happening, all the things that are going on
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:18.320]  I haven't really been thinking about it much
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:20.320]  it's exciting
[2:35:20.320 --> 2:35:22.320]  but at the same time
[2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:24.320]  people who never met celebrities who don't know celebrities
[2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:26.320]  or haven't hung out with real celebrities
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:28.320]  people think it's like cloud nine
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:30.320]  and some magical kingdom
[2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:32.320]  that no one's ever been to and you'd just be happy
[2:35:32.320 --> 2:35:34.320]  and fulfilled if you'd ever been there
[2:35:34.320 --> 2:35:36.320]  and me, I just know so many
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:38.320]  I'm not bragging either
[2:35:38.320 --> 2:35:40.320]  the point is because
[2:35:40.320 --> 2:35:42.320]  they think the same or they agree with me
[2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:44.320]  or they like what I'm doing
[2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:46.320]  or they reach out
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:48.320]  and
[2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:50.320]  so many other countless celebrities
[2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:52.320]  have reached out
[2:35:52.320 --> 2:35:54.320]  and I don't even
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:56.320]  it's really embarrassing
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:35:58.320]  I'm actually not very good at this
[2:35:58.320 --> 2:36:00.320]  I had a huge
[2:36:00.320 --> 2:36:02.320]  icon of rock and roll call a few weeks ago
[2:36:02.320 --> 2:36:04.320]  and I never even called them back
[2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:06.320]  most people would kill for this
[2:36:06.320 --> 2:36:08.320]  and I am just like totally thinking about the New World Order
[2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:10.320]  and banking and FEMA camps
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:12.320]  and army brigades
[2:36:12.320 --> 2:36:14.320]  to occupy the US
[2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:16.320]  and it kind of makes me mad
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:18.320]  I wish I could enjoy
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:20.320]  having huge people call me up
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:22.320]  or finding out about icons that are listeners of this show
[2:36:22.320 --> 2:36:24.320]  and I wish I had
[2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:26.320]  time to
[2:36:26.320 --> 2:36:28.320]  go play golf at Willie Nelson
[2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:30.320]  or get invited out to this place in Maui
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:32.320]  I mean he's just such a great guy
[2:36:32.320 --> 2:36:34.320]  can't do it, gotta stay here
[2:36:34.320 --> 2:36:36.320]  and be hated on and everything else that goes on
[2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:38.320]  but it doesn't matter
[2:36:38.320 --> 2:36:40.320]  it's the work that matters
[2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:42.320]  and also I'm a little bit gun shy
[2:36:42.320 --> 2:36:44.320]  just a little bit gun shy
[2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:48.320]  every time some huge celebrity
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:50.320]  contacts us
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:52.320]  or we run into them
[2:36:52.320 --> 2:36:54.320]  and have them on air
[2:36:54.320 --> 2:36:56.320]  it wakes up new people because it's a fad driven
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:36:58.320]  celebrity driven society
[2:36:58.320 --> 2:37:00.320]  people also resonate with celebrities
[2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:02.320]  getting out of the left-right paradigm
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:04.320]  and really covering hardcore issues
[2:37:04.320 --> 2:37:06.320]  people resonate with the courage
[2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:08.320]  they have coming on next week
[2:37:08.320 --> 2:37:10.320]  one of them rescheduled I think
[2:37:10.320 --> 2:37:12.320]  to Wednesday for Monday because of a flight situation
[2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:14.320]  changing flights but
[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:16.320]  some big gas next week
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:18.320]  and I almost cringe before they come on
[2:37:18.320 --> 2:37:20.320]  because I go oh
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:22.320]  you know I want to have these big people on
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:24.320]  people can hear what they think about the New World Order
[2:37:24.320 --> 2:37:26.320]  people can hear their views
[2:37:26.320 --> 2:37:28.320]  but then it'll get media attention
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:30.320]  and then it wakes people up
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:32.320]  it expands 9-11 Truth, it expands people's awareness
[2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:34.320]  but then
[2:37:34.320 --> 2:37:36.320]  the movement itself that is peopled with
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:38.320]  folks that have
[2:37:38.320 --> 2:37:40.320]  I guess never had my success
[2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:42.320]  the hating
[2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:44.320]  just goes absolutely wild
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:46.320]  and the manufacturing
[2:37:46.320 --> 2:37:48.320]  of baloney
[2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:50.320]  and the lies about me
[2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:52.320]  and it doesn't hurt my feelings
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:37:54.320]  only in that
[2:37:54.320 --> 2:37:56.320]  it doesn't hurt my feelings that I'm being attacked personally
[2:37:56.320 --> 2:37:58.320]  people are lying about me
[2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:00.320]  because I got a thick skin
[2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:02.320]  and I'm kind of the type of person where
[2:38:02.320 --> 2:38:04.320]  in a sick way I just go
[2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:06.320]  but I'm trying to not be like that
[2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:08.320]  I'm trying to not giggle and snicker around
[2:38:08.320 --> 2:38:10.320]  the office like Emperor Palpatine
[2:38:10.320 --> 2:38:12.320]  because that's a little too comfortable for me
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:14.320]  to get into that mode and just go I don't care
[2:38:14.320 --> 2:38:16.320]  but I'm trying to not be a hard
[2:38:16.320 --> 2:38:18.320]  person
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:20.320]  and I'm trying to let my good side dominate
[2:38:20.320 --> 2:38:22.320]  and take over
[2:38:22.320 --> 2:38:24.320]  and then when I totally
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:26.320]  shift over to my good side
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:28.320]  we all have a good side and a bad side
[2:38:28.320 --> 2:38:30.320]  I just feel sorry for people
[2:38:30.320 --> 2:38:32.320]  because folks I'm legitimate
[2:38:32.320 --> 2:38:34.320]  I mean I'm the real deal
[2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:36.320]  and am I perfect? No
[2:38:36.320 --> 2:38:38.320]  but I mean I'm the real deal
[2:38:38.320 --> 2:38:40.320]  and that's why so many millions of people resonate with this show
[2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:42.320]  that's why people of discernment
[2:38:42.320 --> 2:38:44.320]  resonate with this broadcast
[2:38:44.320 --> 2:38:46.320]  that's why people who
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:48.320]  who are
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:50.320]  awakening you know resonate
[2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:52.320]  and it hurts my feelings
[2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:54.320]  that a lot of people attacking us
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:56.320]  are not feds
[2:38:56.320 --> 2:38:58.320]  you know it's easy to say oh they're feds
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:00.320]  they clearly are and that's been admitted before
[2:39:00.320 --> 2:39:02.320]  but a lot of them aren't
[2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:04.320]  they are just people who
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:06.320]  who really
[2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:08.320]  are products of the culture
[2:39:08.320 --> 2:39:10.320]  and so they don't like the New World Order
[2:39:10.320 --> 2:39:12.320]  and they don't like what's going on but they also hate anybody
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:14.320]  doing well
[2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:16.320]  and see that's how the New World Order sees things
[2:39:16.320 --> 2:39:18.320]  they see things like anybody that doesn't like the New World Order
[2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:20.320]  or doesn't like tyranny
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:22.320]  well they're just jealous they want the power
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:24.320]  and you know the old saying
[2:39:24.320 --> 2:39:26.320]  is that revolutionaries
[2:39:26.320 --> 2:39:28.320]  or closet
[2:39:28.320 --> 2:39:30.320]  want to be elitist
[2:39:30.320 --> 2:39:32.320]  or aristocrats
[2:39:32.320 --> 2:39:34.320]  and but I know in my heart
[2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:36.320]  and I know from the people that I work with
[2:39:36.320 --> 2:39:38.320]  people I'm around that there are good decent people
[2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:40.320]  who love liberty and want to face down
[2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:42.320]  this tyranny now
[2:39:44.320 --> 2:39:46.320]  the very process of unseating
[2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:48.320]  tyranny and resisting it
[2:39:48.320 --> 2:39:50.320]  does bring power upon those
[2:39:50.320 --> 2:39:52.320]  who take power in their hands
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:54.320]  so we have taken power
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:56.320]  and to resist tyranny
[2:39:56.320 --> 2:39:58.320]  and we have to be very careful that in that process
[2:39:58.320 --> 2:40:00.320]  we are not
[2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:02.320]  turned into what we were resisting
[2:40:02.320 --> 2:40:04.320]  and that certainly is a great danger
[2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:06.320]  power corrupts
[2:40:06.320 --> 2:40:08.320]  absolutely power corrupts absolutely
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:10.320]  but the fruits of this tree
[2:40:10.320 --> 2:40:12.320]  I mean if we were an apple tree and Christ said judge a tree by its fruits
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:14.320]  this tree is laden
[2:40:14.320 --> 2:40:16.320]  the branches are laying on the ground with just huge
[2:40:16.320 --> 2:40:18.320]  apples
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:20.320]  or oranges
[2:40:20.320 --> 2:40:22.320]  or dates, figs whatever
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:24.320]  the tree you want to imagine fruit tree
[2:40:24.320 --> 2:40:26.320]  with pears
[2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:28.320]  with grapefruit you know whatever
[2:40:28.320 --> 2:40:30.320]  I mean it is just so much fruit
[2:40:30.320 --> 2:40:32.320]  the tree is just bulging with it
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:34.320]  and so many of these people that attack me
[2:40:34.320 --> 2:40:36.320]  they came and you know
[2:40:36.320 --> 2:40:38.320]  they woke up because of the information
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:40.320]  we put out
[2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:42.320]  and if you're
[2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:44.320]  supposedly good people that attack me 24-7
[2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:48.320]  well then how is it that I woke you up
[2:40:48.320 --> 2:40:50.320]  or how was it
[2:40:50.320 --> 2:40:52.320]  that my work and others I woke up woke you up
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:54.320]  I mean how is it that we brought in such a mighty
[2:40:54.320 --> 2:40:56.320]  harvest
[2:40:56.320 --> 2:40:58.320]  and then you're like a bad son
[2:40:58.320 --> 2:41:00.320]  who is 14 years old
[2:41:00.320 --> 2:41:02.320]  and is embarrassed to go out to eat with their parents
[2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:04.320]  and basically hates their parents and hates how your parents
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:06.320]  look and hate how they talk
[2:41:06.320 --> 2:41:08.320]  now once you're 25 and have kids you'll love your parents
[2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:10.320]  and realize how good they were and everything they did
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:12.320]  but you're like snot nose 14 year olds
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:14.320]  looking at your daddy
[2:41:14.320 --> 2:41:16.320]  and who's your daddy you know
[2:41:16.320 --> 2:41:18.320]  a lot of you know it I'm your daddy
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:20.320]  you don't like it
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:22.320]  now listen I never claimed I'm the best daddy
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:24.320]  in this movement and you know I've tried to
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:26.320]  skew the mantle
[2:41:26.320 --> 2:41:28.320]  a million times
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:30.320]  but I just can't do it
[2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:32.320]  I mean if I'm going to risk my life go all the way
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:34.320]  against the new world order do everything I can
[2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:38.320]  against it
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:40.320]  number one I'm not your leader
[2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:42.320]  but I recognize a lot of people see me as a leader
[2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:44.320]  and you've got to start being more sophisticated folks
[2:41:44.320 --> 2:41:46.320]  the government knows how to manipulate
[2:41:46.320 --> 2:41:48.320]  your envy your greed your avarice
[2:41:48.320 --> 2:41:50.320]  your hatred
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:52.320]  your lust all of it
[2:41:52.320 --> 2:41:54.320]  and they know how to whip you up into
[2:41:54.320 --> 2:41:56.320]  just incredible things and you know every time I talk
[2:41:56.320 --> 2:41:58.320]  about this my detractors howl
[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:00.320]  with glee thinking that they're hurting me
[2:42:00.320 --> 2:42:02.320]  you're not in a sick way
[2:42:02.320 --> 2:42:04.320]  through negative energy you're actually
[2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:06.320]  building and energizing and pushing
[2:42:06.320 --> 2:42:08.320]  this show
[2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:10.320]  and you know if you really cold
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:12.320]  bloodedly hated me you'd never talk about me
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:14.320]  I mean if you really cold bloodedly wanted to hurt this
[2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:16.320]  radio show you would ignore it and forget it existed
[2:42:22.320 --> 2:42:24.320]  so understand attacks on this
[2:42:24.320 --> 2:42:26.320]  show only intensify
[2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:28.320]  only make it stronger
[2:42:28.320 --> 2:42:30.320]  I mean attacks with people
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:32.320]  out creating fake websites where they
[2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:34.320]  claim that I'm saying kill people and
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:36.320]  trying to get murder for hire going
[2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:38.320]  that only made people realize
[2:42:38.320 --> 2:42:40.320]  that it was a fraud
[2:42:40.320 --> 2:42:42.320]  and then there's other schizophrenics
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:44.320]  and crazies and nuts
[2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:46.320]  and people who
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:48.320]  I really feel sorry for I wish I could sit down with them
[2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:50.320]  and you know
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:52.320]  get a hold of their hand and look them in the eye
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:54.320]  and you know because
[2:42:54.320 --> 2:42:56.320]  it's easy to hate some jealous envious person
[2:42:56.320 --> 2:42:58.320]  who doesn't like you or dislike
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:00.320]  them or you know just disregard
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:02.320]  and not care and laugh at it but it's
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:04.320]  sad when there's well meaning
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:06.320]  weak-minded people
[2:43:06.320 --> 2:43:08.320]  who have picked up on co until pro
[2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:10.320]  and mockingbird disinformation that's what mockingbird is
[2:43:10.320 --> 2:43:12.320]  you know the CIA puts out their info then others
[2:43:12.320 --> 2:43:14.320]  parrot it and just
[2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:16.320]  to see that you know to see people who I
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:18.320]  know are deceived and to see
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:20.320]  people I know are in bondage
[2:43:20.320 --> 2:43:22.320]  and people I know could have so much
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:24.320]  more potential
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:26.320]  with their radio shows and their films
[2:43:26.320 --> 2:43:28.320]  and their websites
[2:43:28.320 --> 2:43:30.320]  if they just wouldn't be
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:32.320]  in fighting little bastards and you know
[2:43:32.320 --> 2:43:34.320]  you know who these people are there's hundreds of them
[2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:36.320]  and they always attack and there's always someone new
[2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:38.320]  they're attacking and it's always about
[2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:40.320]  who's the best or who puts out what info
[2:43:40.320 --> 2:43:42.320]  or who's right about this hey
[2:43:42.320 --> 2:43:44.320]  folks we're now nearing
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:46.320]  the economic collapse I mean they're
[2:43:46.320 --> 2:43:48.320]  deploying regular army to the US for
[2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:50.320]  a homeland mission against the American people
[2:43:50.320 --> 2:43:52.320]  what's in John Warren defense authorization act
[2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:54.320]  is now openly stated by the army
[2:43:56.320 --> 2:43:58.320]  the rubber is now meeting the road and
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:00.320]  people you really need to just
[2:44:00.320 --> 2:44:02.320]  have a gut check
[2:44:02.320 --> 2:44:04.320]  and really analyze your own mindsets
[2:44:04.320 --> 2:44:06.320]  out there and ask yourself what
[2:44:06.320 --> 2:44:08.320]  direction you're going in
[2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:12.320]  and you need to do it now
[2:44:12.320 --> 2:44:14.320]  because we need everybody in this movement
[2:44:14.320 --> 2:44:16.320]  so any of you that aren't government agents
[2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:18.320]  any of you that aren't being handled
[2:44:18.320 --> 2:44:20.320]  you need to really
[2:44:22.320 --> 2:44:24.320]  be circumspect about it
[2:44:24.320 --> 2:44:26.320]  and look at yourselves
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:28.320]  and I try to look at myself every day and believe me
[2:44:28.320 --> 2:44:30.320]  I don't like what I see a lot of the time
[2:44:30.320 --> 2:44:32.320]  and I have to pull up and behave myself
[2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:34.320]  I mean Lord knows I'm a worldly person
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:36.320]  and I've been around the block a couple times
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:38.320]  and you know I don't claim to be perfect
[2:44:38.320 --> 2:44:40.320]  but I try every day to be a good person
[2:44:40.320 --> 2:44:42.320]  I try every day
[2:44:42.320 --> 2:44:44.320]  to not be wicked I try every day
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:46.320]  to make moral decisions and to be
[2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:48.320]  sharing and loving and compassionate
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:50.320]  and helpful and to have empathy for people
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:52.320]  and I know when you have empathy it hurts
[2:44:52.320 --> 2:44:54.320]  because you see all the other bad things
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:56.320]  that are happening to people and then you care
[2:44:56.320 --> 2:44:58.320]  and then it gets to you
[2:44:58.320 --> 2:45:00.320]  or you could just be a hard person
[2:45:00.320 --> 2:45:02.320]  who just doesn't care and I'm out for myself
[2:45:02.320 --> 2:45:04.320]  that's so what
[2:45:04.320 --> 2:45:06.320]  and kind of go through life but then
[2:45:06.320 --> 2:45:08.320]  you shudder yourself in
[2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:10.320]  you limit who you could truly be
[2:45:10.320 --> 2:45:12.320]  by not opening your soul up to the world
[2:45:12.320 --> 2:45:14.320]  by not being a good person
[2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:16.320]  so I would just tell everybody
[2:45:16.320 --> 2:45:18.320]  we're coming towards points in time
[2:45:18.320 --> 2:45:20.320]  when things are going to get much worse than they are now
[2:45:20.320 --> 2:45:22.320]  that's undoubted
[2:45:22.320 --> 2:45:24.320]  I mean that's a foregone conclusion
[2:45:24.320 --> 2:45:26.320]  the only question is how severe
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:28.320]  will the military, socioeconomic, political
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:30.320]  societal
[2:45:30.320 --> 2:45:32.320]  I mean it's not just the government that's going to hell
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:34.320]  I mean the public is acting like ravenous demons
[2:45:34.320 --> 2:45:36.320]  in parking
[2:45:36.320 --> 2:45:38.320]  in stores on the street
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:40.320]  in business
[2:45:40.320 --> 2:45:42.320]  hacking of all types is way up
[2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:44.320]  just stealing is way up
[2:45:44.320 --> 2:45:46.320]  I mean it's going to get bad
[2:45:46.320 --> 2:45:48.320]  I mean it's going to get bad
[2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:50.320]  and I would challenge
[2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:52.320]  our movement to spend all the time you can
[2:45:52.320 --> 2:45:54.320]  exposing things we can stop
[2:45:54.320 --> 2:45:56.320]  the bankers are behind it
[2:45:56.320 --> 2:45:58.320]  the bankers are criminal, the bankers engineered it
[2:45:58.320 --> 2:46:00.320]  don't drink sodium fluoride
[2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:02.320]  and the other toxins they put in there under that name
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:04.320]  you know learn how to properly filter
[2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:06.320]  don't take mercury filled shots
[2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:08.320]  don't give it to babies
[2:46:08.320 --> 2:46:10.320]  don't eat GMO foods
[2:46:10.320 --> 2:46:12.320]  don't eat MSG, don't eat aspartame
[2:46:12.320 --> 2:46:14.320]  I mean this is stuff killing millions of people
[2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:16.320]  every year
[2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:18.320]  and this is something we can do now
[2:46:18.320 --> 2:46:20.320]  something warning people
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:22.320]  folks are really listening, we've reached
[2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:24.320]  exponential flash point
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:26.320]  now is when people will actually listen to you
[2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:28.320]  the CPS is in trouble
[2:46:28.320 --> 2:46:30.320]  child protective services
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:32.320]  family services caught raping
[2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:34.320]  killing kids everywhere
[2:46:34.320 --> 2:46:36.320]  rape rooms at the
[2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:38.320]  dormitories, it's all over the news worldwide
[2:46:38.320 --> 2:46:40.320]  in the US, in England, Europe
[2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:42.320]  the government is really being discredited right now
[2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:44.320]  we can go and take over local governments
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:46.320]  peacefully, we can get rid of the electronic
[2:46:46.320 --> 2:46:48.320]  voting machines, we're having victories in many areas there
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:50.320]  where people fight back
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:52.320]  but people say give me a solution
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:54.320]  give me a solution, it isn't some silver bullet
[2:46:54.320 --> 2:46:56.320]  out of congress, it is you
[2:46:56.320 --> 2:46:58.320]  gut checking, looking in the mirror
[2:46:58.320 --> 2:47:00.320]  not spending your time spinning your wheels
[2:47:00.320 --> 2:47:02.320]  fighting and infighting with our movement
[2:47:02.320 --> 2:47:04.320]  and saying who's right or who's this
[2:47:04.320 --> 2:47:06.320]  or who's that or he doesn't cover this
[2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:08.320]  he doesn't cover that
[2:47:08.320 --> 2:47:10.320]  somebody didn't cover and something calling to the show
[2:47:10.320 --> 2:47:12.320]  and don't accuse them of not covering it
[2:47:12.320 --> 2:47:14.320]  say hey you ought to have this person on, hey let me tell you about this
[2:47:14.320 --> 2:47:16.320]  you know have an attitude
[2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:18.320]  of winners because the world needs us
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:20.320]  the salt of the earth, the light of the world
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:22.320]  they need people that love liberty
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:24.320]  and love God and love honor
[2:47:24.320 --> 2:47:26.320]  and love innocence
[2:47:26.320 --> 2:47:28.320]  and you're needed folks
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:30.320]  not to have this morbid new world order spell
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:32.320]  of just you know just
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:34.320]  with each other
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:36.320]  it's disgusting
[2:47:36.320 --> 2:47:38.320]  and not just against me, it's everybody doing this
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:40.320]  it has to stop
[2:47:40.320 --> 2:47:42.320]  those of you that are aware of this information
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:44.320]  have a sacred duty and honor
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:46.320]  to get this information out
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:48.320]  well how do I do that then, tell me exactly how
[2:47:48.320 --> 2:47:50.320]  hey there's a million ways to do it
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:52.320]  I'll give you examples
[2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:54.320]  we got loaded phone lines here, somebody disagrees
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:47:56.320]  so I'm going to skip ahead of
[2:47:56.320 --> 2:47:58.320]  they dropped off
[2:47:58.320 --> 2:48:00.320]  they dropped off
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:02.320]  and there's no phone lines open
[2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:04.320]  nope they're all full
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:06.320]  they're all full
[2:48:06.320 --> 2:48:08.320]  Michael and Oregon said you disagreed
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:10.320]  if you can call back at
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:12.320]  1-800-25 at 999-231
[2:48:12.320 --> 2:48:14.320]  I'll put you ahead of the line
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:16.320]  there's so many here, I don't know who's first
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:18.320]  Scott in Arizona
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:20.320]  go ahead
[2:48:20.320 --> 2:48:22.320]  oh hey Alex
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:24.320]  my question is
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:26.320]  we know that we're going to be the ones paying this
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:28.320]  bell out back, alright
[2:48:28.320 --> 2:48:30.320]  and I talked about this before but I want to
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:32.320]  find out, we know it's 5 trillion
[2:48:32.320 --> 2:48:34.320]  what Bloomberg's reporting is probably true
[2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:36.320]  where are they getting this money
[2:48:36.320 --> 2:48:38.320]  first of all, where are they getting
[2:48:38.320 --> 2:48:40.320]  the money, they released that
[2:48:40.320 --> 2:48:42.320]  exactly, printed that out
[2:48:42.320 --> 2:48:44.320]  they're going to sell debt
[2:48:44.320 --> 2:48:46.320]  that basically
[2:48:46.320 --> 2:48:48.320]  the US taxpayer has to pay for
[2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:50.320]  so let me explain
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:52.320]  they're just going to levy taxes
[2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:54.320]  and fines and fees
[2:48:54.320 --> 2:48:56.320]  and they're going to raise some of the money
[2:48:56.320 --> 2:48:58.320]  by selling US
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:00.320]  securities on the world market
[2:49:00.320 --> 2:49:02.320]  what are the securities that they've listed
[2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:04.320]  there's different types of bonds
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:06.320]  different types of government bonds
[2:49:06.320 --> 2:49:08.320]  different types of government securities
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:10.320]  and that's going to come up with
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:12.320]  700 billion that they're talking about
[2:49:12.320 --> 2:49:14.320]  it's called the national debt
[2:49:14.320 --> 2:49:16.320]  but again
[2:49:16.320 --> 2:49:18.320]  part of it's financed
[2:49:18.320 --> 2:49:20.320]  part of it's done through
[2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:22.320]  but again
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:24.320]  then when those become mature
[2:49:24.320 --> 2:49:26.320]  the American people through taxes
[2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:28.320]  have to pay off on those bonds
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:30.320]  understand how that works
[2:49:30.320 --> 2:49:32.320]  they issue the bonds and then when it's time to cash in
[2:49:32.320 --> 2:49:34.320]  the one year, the two year, the three year
[2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:36.320]  the ten year
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:38.320]  when it's time for those to come in
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:40.320]  they're always coming in, we pay
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:42.320]  guys in black schemas come and kick down
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:44.320]  your door and drag you out and sell all your stuff
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:46.320]  and sell your house
[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:48.320]  I got a question for you
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:50.320]  you think they're going to come up with a debtors prison
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:52.320]  for Americans that are
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:54.320]  England is actually setting those up
[2:49:54.320 --> 2:49:56.320]  and they're talking about arresting you now
[2:49:56.320 --> 2:49:58.320]  for debts in this country, yes
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:00.320]  our debts will not be forgiven
[2:50:00.320 --> 2:50:02.320]  that's what I'm wondering about
[2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:04.320]  because that sounds like something they're going to come out in the future here
[2:50:04.320 --> 2:50:06.320]  real shortly
[2:50:06.320 --> 2:50:08.320]  they're bastards, all kinds of stuff

[2:54:24.320 --> 2:54:26.320]  Alex
[2:54:26.320 --> 2:54:28.320]  yes sir
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:30.320]  you know that they're understating it
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:32.320]  the amount of money for the bailout in the bill correct
[2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:34.320]  yes
[2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:36.320]  you know that Bloomberg said 5 trillion
[2:54:36.320 --> 2:54:38.320]  and he's getting closer right
[2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:40.320]  yes sir
[2:54:40.320 --> 2:54:42.320]  and you know that he's getting closer
[2:54:42.320 --> 2:54:44.320]  right
[2:54:44.320 --> 2:54:46.320]  and you know it's a lot further out than that
[2:54:46.320 --> 2:54:48.320]  right
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:50.320]  but well in the bill
[2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:52.320]  the way they have structured it
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:54.320]  it's basically unlimited
[2:54:54.320 --> 2:54:56.320]  it says they can just do whatever they want
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:54:58.320]  exactly and I've been following you
[2:54:58.320 --> 2:55:00.320]  and listening to a lot of this stuff
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:02.320]  and you know that we know that
[2:55:02.320 --> 2:55:04.320]  is this going to change anything
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:06.320]  it's going to rapidly devalue the dollar
[2:55:06.320 --> 2:55:08.320]  and government is going to squeeze at every level
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:10.320]  to get assets to pay it
[2:55:10.320 --> 2:55:12.320]  eventually
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:14.320]  yes eventually and it will be far worse
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:16.320]  far worse
[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:18.320]  now do you think this will change any of their agendas
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:20.320]  for Iran
[2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:22.320]  or confronting Russia
[2:55:22.320 --> 2:55:24.320]  by doing this they will continue to fund their operation
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:26.320]  so it will allow them to continue
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:28.320]  right and isn't this thing so far out
[2:55:28.320 --> 2:55:30.320]  that they actually need to capture
[2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:32.320]  even more resources
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:34.320]  and more control
[2:55:34.320 --> 2:55:36.320]  eventually to keep the Ponzi scheme going
[2:55:36.320 --> 2:55:38.320]  you said it all brother
[2:55:38.320 --> 2:55:40.320]  and what are we doing here
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:42.320]  why shouldn't we have approached this
[2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:44.320]  not as a bailout
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:46.320]  but we should approach this as a buyout
[2:55:46.320 --> 2:55:48.320]  of the Federal Reserve and end this nonsense
[2:55:48.320 --> 2:55:50.320]  I agree I've been saying
[2:55:50.320 --> 2:55:52.320]  nationalize the Federal Reserve
[2:55:52.320 --> 2:55:54.320]  take it over and arrest them and you heard Ron Paul saying
[2:55:54.320 --> 2:55:56.320]  they should be arrested and that needs to be a headline
[2:55:56.320 --> 2:55:58.320]  on info wars dot com right there
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:56:00.320]  I agree you know
[2:56:00.320 --> 2:56:02.320]  you know what's going to happen here
[2:56:02.320 --> 2:56:04.320]  they're going to bankrupt everything
[2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:06.320]  they're going to suck everything dry
[2:56:06.320 --> 2:56:08.320]  that's why the one in ten college grads
[2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:10.320]  homeland security it's going to shift
[2:56:10.320 --> 2:56:12.320]  into a military industrial complex economy
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:14.320]  and it's going to be hell on earth
[2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:16.320]  and it's going to be at the barrel of a gun
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:18.320]  they're going to kill a lot of people
[2:56:18.320 --> 2:56:20.320]  yep they're planning a malice regime
[2:56:20.320 --> 2:56:22.320]  and folks we're going into hell
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:24.320]  and Alex
[2:56:24.320 --> 2:56:26.320]  wouldn't you and I know you would because
[2:56:26.320 --> 2:56:28.320]  you're similar you have children like I have
[2:56:28.320 --> 2:56:30.320]  wouldn't you rather go through a few years
[2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:32.320]  of misery
[2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:34.320]  and face and help other people
[2:56:34.320 --> 2:56:36.320]  survive this misery
[2:56:36.320 --> 2:56:38.320]  and go back to a
[2:56:38.320 --> 2:56:40.320]  you know a well yes I would
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:42.320]  I mean there's three choices let it crash
[2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:44.320]  let them expand the scam
[2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:46.320]  and crash it even bigger to consolidate later
[2:56:46.320 --> 2:56:48.320]  or
[2:56:48.320 --> 2:56:50.320]  arrest them grab these private institutions
[2:56:50.320 --> 2:56:52.320]  that have engaged in crime
[2:56:52.320 --> 2:56:54.320]  and then bail the American people out
[2:56:54.320 --> 2:56:56.320]  and build the infrastructure back
[2:56:56.320 --> 2:56:58.320]  and you even heard Ron Paul say
[2:56:58.320 --> 2:57:00.320]  as big a libertarian as he is
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:02.320]  we are so debased
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:04.320]  to have to be government support of the people
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:06.320]  Alex there's not going to be any
[2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:08.320]  resolution to any of this until we approach
[2:57:08.320 --> 2:57:10.320]  the idea of the Federal Reserve and buy them out
[2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:12.320]  well not even buy them out and they need to be
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:14.320]  arrested it needs to be directly
[2:57:14.320 --> 2:57:16.320]  you know
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:18.320]  nationalized right now
[2:57:18.320 --> 2:57:20.320]  you know the when they talk about putting full
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:22.320]  brigades and they're rotating them
[2:57:22.320 --> 2:57:24.320]  in and out of Iraq when I understand
[2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:26.320]  they're going to build up a huge force it's not one
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:28.320]  when they're here and they finally get
[2:57:28.320 --> 2:57:30.320]  disgusted with having to do this
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:32.320]  horrible task of confronting
[2:57:32.320 --> 2:57:34.320]  the people who will resist
[2:57:34.320 --> 2:57:36.320]  then they when they finally look like they may
[2:57:36.320 --> 2:57:38.320]  acquiesce to the people then they're going to
[2:57:38.320 --> 2:57:40.320]  float them out again
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:42.320]  well they're also going to find out who likes it
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:44.320]  and who doesn't and then keep them here
[2:57:44.320 --> 2:57:46.320]  in sheep dipped local commas are
[2:57:46.320 --> 2:57:48.320]  so you'll just have them in a local
[2:57:48.320 --> 2:57:50.320]  federal police uniform strutting around

[2:57:52.320 --> 2:57:54.320]  and hotcakes and strutting around

[2:57:56.320 --> 2:57:58.320]  and marching and everyone

[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:02.320]  oh god I love the government
[2:58:02.320 --> 2:58:04.320]  it's just a bowing broke back

[2:59:42.320 --> 2:59:44.320]  then Cole, Brian and Christopher
[2:59:44.320 --> 2:59:46.320]  Bob Chapman rides shotgun
[2:59:46.320 --> 2:59:48.320]  the international forecaster.com
[2:59:48.320 --> 2:59:50.320]  the rest of the hour with us
[2:59:50.320 --> 2:59:52.320]  so much has happened since he was on with us last week
[2:59:52.320 --> 2:59:54.320]  things are accelerating fast
[2:59:54.320 --> 2:59:56.320]  Bob let's break down
[2:59:56.320 --> 2:59:58.320]  from your perspective with the biggest newsletter
[2:59:58.320 --> 3:00:00.320]  in
[3:00:00.320 --> 3:00:02.320]  financial history in the US
[3:00:02.320 --> 3:00:04.320]  military intelligence before that
[3:00:04.320 --> 3:00:06.320]  one of the largest gold and silver brokers
[3:00:06.320 --> 3:00:08.320]  in one of your incarnations
[3:00:08.320 --> 3:00:10.320]  and you're back out of retirement now with one of the biggest newsletters
[3:00:10.320 --> 3:00:12.320]  again the international forecaster
[3:00:12.320 --> 3:00:14.320]  you've been forecasting and breaking all this down
[3:00:14.320 --> 3:00:16.320]  for a long time
[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:18.320]  you've said within the next two years total depression
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:20.320]  basically no way to get out of that
[3:00:20.320 --> 3:00:22.320]  Ron Paul was saying it looks like they are going to try to go into
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:24.320]  martial law with the army brigades
[3:00:24.320 --> 3:00:26.320]  the congress is agreeing
[3:00:26.320 --> 3:00:28.320]  to the total bailout basically making Paulson
[3:00:28.320 --> 3:00:30.320]  supreme dictator
[3:00:30.320 --> 3:00:32.320]  the world economy, the power to buy
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:34.320]  sell, raid any companies
[3:00:34.320 --> 3:00:36.320]  the way other analysts have read this
[3:00:36.320 --> 3:00:38.320]  it allows them to grab houses
[3:00:38.320 --> 3:00:40.320]  infrastructure under executive orders
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:42.320]  just break down
[3:00:42.320 --> 3:00:44.320]  what we're witnessing from your own
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:46.320]  perspective in your own words
[3:00:46.320 --> 3:00:48.320]  Bob Chapman
[3:00:48.320 --> 3:00:50.320]  well first of all
[3:00:50.320 --> 3:00:52.320]  the people who are ostensibly
[3:00:52.320 --> 3:00:54.320]  trying to save us
[3:00:54.320 --> 3:00:56.320]  from all of this
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:00:58.320]  are the people who executed
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:00.320]  the whole thing in the first place
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:02.320]  and the American public
[3:01:02.320 --> 3:01:04.320]  doesn't know that
[3:01:04.320 --> 3:01:06.320]  no one has told them that
[3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:08.320]  and
[3:01:08.320 --> 3:01:10.320]  you'd think that'd be a big news item
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:12.320]  a huge issue that literally
[3:01:12.320 --> 3:01:14.320]  the architect of this even more than
[3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:16.320]  Greenspan is Paulson
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:18.320]  he is the chief
[3:01:18.320 --> 3:01:20.320]  scallywag
[3:01:20.320 --> 3:01:22.320]  the chief thief, the leader
[3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:24.320]  of this gang of pirates
[3:01:24.320 --> 3:01:26.320]  and he's running around as our savior
[3:01:26.320 --> 3:01:28.320]  exactly
[3:01:28.320 --> 3:01:30.320]  and he was with
[3:01:30.320 --> 3:01:32.320]  Goldman Sachs when all this was going on
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:34.320]  and so he was a contributor
[3:01:34.320 --> 3:01:36.320]  to the
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:38.320]  in part to the collapse
[3:01:38.320 --> 3:01:40.320]  of the economic system
[3:01:40.320 --> 3:01:42.320]  and that was caused by
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:44.320]  voracious greed on the part
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:46.320]  of all of these people
[3:01:46.320 --> 3:01:48.320]  the ringmaster
[3:01:48.320 --> 3:01:50.320]  was previously
[3:01:50.320 --> 3:01:52.320]  Sir Alan Greenspan
[3:01:52.320 --> 3:01:54.320]  and now we have Ben Bernanke
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:56.320]  whose idea of
[3:01:56.320 --> 3:01:58.320]  settling a financial question
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:00.320]  is to use helicopters and
[3:02:00.320 --> 3:02:02.320]  piles of money that they can dump out of
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:04.320]  and it'll be tell you something
[3:02:04.320 --> 3:02:06.320]  were they not able to pass this
[3:02:06.320 --> 3:02:08.320]  bailout they would have
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:10.320]  ran the thing anyway
[3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:12.320]  and just continue to create
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:14.320]  masses of amounts of money
[3:02:14.320 --> 3:02:16.320]  and credit to keep the system floating
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:18.320]  the whole thing is all about
[3:02:18.320 --> 3:02:20.320]  bailing out Wall Street
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:22.320]  and the bankers
[3:02:22.320 --> 3:02:24.320]  the numbers that we're talking about here
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:26.320]  the minimum losses over the next 5 years
[3:02:26.320 --> 3:02:28.320]  will be 3 trillion dollars
[3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:30.320]  it could get as high as
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:32.320]  10 trillion nobody really knows yet because
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:34.320]  so you think that's a good number
[3:02:34.320 --> 3:02:36.320]  out of Bloomberg 5 trillion
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:38.320]  is that what they said
[3:02:38.320 --> 3:02:40.320]  yes
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:42.320]  well that's a good number
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:44.320]  a very good number
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:46.320]  because I'm being conservative 3 to 10
[3:02:46.320 --> 3:02:48.320]  and I don't know where yet because
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:50.320]  I don't know what's on everybody's balance sheets
[3:02:50.320 --> 3:02:52.320]  because they're hiding it
[3:02:52.320 --> 3:02:54.320]  and these are the same people
[3:02:54.320 --> 3:02:56.320]  that Bernanke
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:02:58.320]  and Paulson
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:03:00.320]  are acting for
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:02.320]  to relieve them
[3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:04.320]  of all of this debt that they created
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:06.320]  through either their incompetence
[3:03:06.320 --> 3:03:08.320]  the corruption or their greed
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:10.320]  well
[3:03:10.320 --> 3:03:12.320]  I mean
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:14.320]  reading this where it says no one can question
[3:03:14.320 --> 3:03:16.320]  no one can investigate anything they want
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:18.320]  to buy, sell, any activity
[3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:20.320]  all of them retroactively
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:22.320]  have
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:24.320]  liability, protection
[3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:26.320]  that's not even the right word they're
[3:03:26.320 --> 3:03:28.320]  literally being given a pardon
[3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:30.320]  immunity
[3:03:30.320 --> 3:03:32.320]  I mean this is just
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:34.320]  and the public's just walking around going
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:36.320]  I mean I say that but you only have 28%
[3:03:36.320 --> 3:03:38.320]  even worse
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:40.320]  Alex is the Congress
[3:03:40.320 --> 3:03:42.320]  they know what's going on
[3:03:42.320 --> 3:03:44.320]  they've known for four years that Fannie
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:46.320]  and Freddie were bankrupt
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:48.320]  it's a conspiracy of silence
[3:03:48.320 --> 3:03:50.320]  and I'll tell you if they vote for this thing
[3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:52.320]  you people out there
[3:03:52.320 --> 3:03:54.320]  have got to vote everyone
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:03:56.320]  out of office who voted for it
[3:03:56.320 --> 3:03:58.320]  in both houses
[3:03:58.320 --> 3:04:00.320]  we don't want them anymore
[3:04:00.320 --> 3:04:02.320]  the polls out there are now showing
[3:04:02.320 --> 3:04:04.320]  that 66% of the people
[3:04:04.320 --> 3:04:06.320]  are against this
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:08.320]  I mean is that plain enough
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:10.320]  actually the Ross
[3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:12.320]  the mission poll this is very accurate shows 28%
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:14.320]  for it so
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:16.320]  that'd be 70
[3:04:16.320 --> 3:04:18.320]  72% against it
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:20.320]  stay there Bob Chapman we'll come back

[3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:34.320]  a terrorist act of war
[3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:36.320]  against this country
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:38.320]  the enemy struck America on September 11

[3:07:42.320 --> 3:07:44.320]  final hour
[3:07:44.320 --> 3:07:46.320]  we'll be breaking down what we're seeing unfold
[3:07:46.320 --> 3:07:48.320]  right now
[3:07:50.320 --> 3:07:52.320]  we won't know until probably Saturday
[3:07:52.320 --> 3:07:54.320]  what's going to go on
[3:07:54.320 --> 3:07:56.320]  but all they're doing
[3:07:56.320 --> 3:07:58.320]  is buying a little time here
[3:07:58.320 --> 3:08:00.320]  a little time maybe a year or two years max
[3:08:00.320 --> 3:08:02.320]  to extend the process
[3:08:02.320 --> 3:08:04.320]  of collapse
[3:08:04.320 --> 3:08:06.320]  and the price is going to be paid as this
[3:08:06.320 --> 3:08:08.320]  horrific debt
[3:08:08.320 --> 3:08:10.320]  and then on top of it
[3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:12.320]  you're going to have massive inflation
[3:08:12.320 --> 3:08:14.320]  because the money that's going to be put into the system
[3:08:14.320 --> 3:08:16.320]  was just created
[3:08:16.320 --> 3:08:18.320]  out of thin air
[3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:20.320]  effectively
[3:08:20.320 --> 3:08:22.320]  and it's immediately going to get monetized
[3:08:22.320 --> 3:08:24.320]  and immediately be translated
[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:26.320]  to inflation
[3:08:26.320 --> 3:08:28.320]  as opposed to that normal money and credit being
[3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:30.320]  injected into the economy
[3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:32.320]  it takes about a year and a half
[3:08:32.320 --> 3:08:34.320]  or a year or six months
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:36.320]  for it to show up
[3:08:36.320 --> 3:08:38.320]  in a form of inflation
[3:08:38.320 --> 3:08:40.320]  this happens immediately
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:42.320]  we're calling inflation at 13 and 5
[3:08:42.320 --> 3:08:44.320]  8%
[3:08:44.320 --> 3:08:46.320]  and I would think that next year
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:48.320]  inflation would be over 20%
[3:08:48.320 --> 3:08:50.320]  and if they continue to do that
[3:08:50.320 --> 3:08:52.320]  because they don't need $800
[3:08:52.320 --> 3:08:54.320]  or $700 billion
[3:08:54.320 --> 3:08:56.320]  they really need $3 trillion
[3:08:56.320 --> 3:08:58.320]  well, you get Weimarism
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:00.320]  written all over it
[3:09:00.320 --> 3:09:02.320]  and we're going to go through the same thing that they did
[3:09:02.320 --> 3:09:04.320]  in Germany in 1920 to 1923
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:06.320]  now Bob
[3:09:06.320 --> 3:09:08.320]  explain to people because it hasn't been taught in school anymore
[3:09:08.320 --> 3:09:10.320]  explain what 15%
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:12.320]  or 20%
[3:09:12.320 --> 3:09:14.320]  compounded each year inflation
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:16.320]  means, that's like
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:18.320]  someone coming in your bank account each year
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:20.320]  and stealing 20% out of it
[3:09:20.320 --> 3:09:22.320]  and then it compounds
[3:09:22.320 --> 3:09:24.320]  each year until in just three or four years
[3:09:24.320 --> 3:09:26.320]  there's nothing left
[3:09:26.320 --> 3:09:28.320]  major federal studies and those are even white washes
[3:09:28.320 --> 3:09:30.320]  admit that the last six years
[3:09:30.320 --> 3:09:32.320]  half the buying power
[3:09:32.320 --> 3:09:34.320]  of people on social security has already been lost
[3:09:34.320 --> 3:09:36.320]  my god, if another 20% has lost in the next year
[3:09:36.320 --> 3:09:38.320]  I mean this is going to be terminal
[3:09:38.320 --> 3:09:40.320]  for the real economy
[3:09:40.320 --> 3:09:42.320]  that's right
[3:09:42.320 --> 3:09:44.320]  absolutely correct
[3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:46.320]  they don't want to talk about that in congress
[3:09:46.320 --> 3:09:48.320]  I mean these people
[3:09:48.320 --> 3:09:50.320]  are absolutely despicable
[3:09:50.320 --> 3:09:52.320]  in our congress
[3:09:52.320 --> 3:09:54.320]  they know what's going on
[3:09:54.320 --> 3:09:56.320]  and yet they're going to go along with the bankers program
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:09:58.320]  the program to save the rich
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:00.320]  and
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:02.320]  I'm not a rich guy, poor guy
[3:10:02.320 --> 3:10:04.320]  sort of person
[3:10:04.320 --> 3:10:06.320]  life long, hardcore, rock hard
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:08.320]  conservative
[3:10:08.320 --> 3:10:10.320]  and I'm telling you
[3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:12.320]  this is fascism
[3:10:12.320 --> 3:10:14.320]  first class
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:16.320]  and I see them talking on CNBC
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:18.320]  about
[3:10:18.320 --> 3:10:20.320]  if you can believe this term
[3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:22.320]  and I heard Robert Reich this morning
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:24.320]  who's the former evil dwarf
[3:10:24.320 --> 3:10:26.320]  of the Clinton administration
[3:10:26.320 --> 3:10:28.320]  he's an economist at Harvard
[3:10:28.320 --> 3:10:30.320]  talking about
[3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:32.320]  socialism
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:34.320]  and capitalism
[3:10:34.320 --> 3:10:36.320]  the marriage of them two together
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:38.320]  which would be called social capitalism
[3:10:38.320 --> 3:10:40.320]  I never heard
[3:10:40.320 --> 3:10:42.320]  anything so insane in my life
[3:10:42.320 --> 3:10:44.320]  and this guy teaches at Harvard
[3:10:44.320 --> 3:10:46.320]  he's better off teaching
[3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:48.320]  tiddlywinks
[3:10:52.320 --> 3:10:54.320]  well, we're going to have lots of inflation
[3:10:54.320 --> 3:10:56.320]  we're going to have lots of unemployment
[3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:00.320]  and
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:02.320]  I think that wages are not going to increase
[3:11:02.320 --> 3:11:04.320]  they've been increasing
[3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:06.320]  in about 3% a year
[3:11:06.320 --> 3:11:08.320]  so inflation is 13.5%, 5-8%
[3:11:08.320 --> 3:11:10.320]  then
[3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:12.320]  we're losing 10%
[3:11:12.320 --> 3:11:14.320]  you know, the average wage earner is
[3:11:14.320 --> 3:11:16.320]  and so
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:18.320]  you know, 10 years of that
[3:11:18.320 --> 3:11:20.320]  you don't have anything in buying power
[3:11:20.320 --> 3:11:22.320]  another thing that people seem to miss here
[3:11:22.320 --> 3:11:24.320]  is that
[3:11:24.320 --> 3:11:26.320]  our economy has been slowing down into recession
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:28.320]  for the last one and three-quarter years
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:30.320]  almost two years in February
[3:11:30.320 --> 3:11:32.320]  now
[3:11:32.320 --> 3:11:34.320]  during that process
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:36.320]  we've been having people get laid off
[3:11:36.320 --> 3:11:38.320]  and so
[3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:40.320]  we've got three figures from unemployment
[3:11:40.320 --> 3:11:42.320]  the 6.1 they tell you about
[3:11:42.320 --> 3:11:44.320]  the U6 which is 10 and 7-8
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:46.320]  and the long-term unemployment
[3:11:46.320 --> 3:11:48.320]  and these are government figures
[3:11:48.320 --> 3:11:50.320]  which is 14 and 7-8%
[3:11:50.320 --> 3:11:52.320]  now that is going to at least double
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:54.320]  over the next three years
[3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:56.320]  but again, we have all the parents
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:11:58.320]  already have
[3:11:58.320 --> 3:12:00.320]  my punchline here, hold on
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:02.320]  now, 70% of the GDP
[3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:04.320]  right now
[3:12:04.320 --> 3:12:06.320]  comes from consumerism
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:08.320]  and I see some figures
[3:12:08.320 --> 3:12:10.320]  have been as high as 72%
[3:12:10.320 --> 3:12:12.320]  we'll call it 70%
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:14.320]  the average long-term
[3:12:14.320 --> 3:12:16.320]  mean since the Second World War
[3:12:18.320 --> 3:12:20.320]  that the consumer contributed to GDP
[3:12:20.320 --> 3:12:22.320]  is 64.5%
[3:12:22.320 --> 3:12:24.320]  if we just go back to 64.5%
[3:12:24.320 --> 3:12:26.320]  the mean
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:28.320]  unemployment will be 35%
[3:12:30.320 --> 3:12:32.320]  now I want you to slowly go back over that again
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:34.320]  because that is so huge
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:36.320]  everywhere I hear it parroted
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:38.320]  oh, unemployment is only 6.1%
[3:12:38.320 --> 3:12:40.320]  but they cook that number
[3:12:40.320 --> 3:12:42.320]  because after you go off the unemployment roles
[3:12:42.320 --> 3:12:44.320]  after six months and are not
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:46.320]  re-employed, they take you out of the role
[3:12:46.320 --> 3:12:48.320]  but when you look at the real number
[3:12:48.320 --> 3:12:50.320]  which they don't publicize
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:12:52.320]  the long-term unemployment
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:54.320]  is about a staggering
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:12:56.320]  double-digit figure
[3:12:56.320 --> 3:12:58.320]  and my god, that is
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:00.320]  depression level to have
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:02.320]  go over those numbers again
[3:13:02.320 --> 3:13:04.320]  the short term is 6.1%
[3:13:04.320 --> 3:13:06.320]  the intermediate term
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:08.320]  including the people that just left
[3:13:08.320 --> 3:13:10.320]  unemployment lines
[3:13:10.320 --> 3:13:12.320]  or unemployment payments
[3:13:12.320 --> 3:13:14.320]  is 10 and 7.8%
[3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:16.320]  the long-term
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:18.320]  people going back to 1990
[3:13:18.320 --> 3:13:20.320]  is 14.7%
[3:13:20.320 --> 3:13:22.320]  or 14.7%
[3:13:22.320 --> 3:13:24.320]  which is 14.875
[3:13:26.320 --> 3:13:28.320]  and the government doesn't want
[3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:30.320]  you to hear about it, just like you said Alex
[3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:32.320]  they don't publicize it
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:34.320]  but they do publish it
[3:13:34.320 --> 3:13:36.320]  they never talk about
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:38.320]  the birth-death ratio
[3:13:38.320 --> 3:13:40.320]  this is a little trick that they've got
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:42.320]  that they use and they hypothetically
[3:13:42.320 --> 3:13:44.320]  out of thin air
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:46.320]  pull figures out
[3:13:46.320 --> 3:13:48.320]  as to how many people
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:50.320]  work for us
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:52.320]  and how many people got jobs
[3:13:52.320 --> 3:13:54.320]  that they think they got but they don't know
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:13:56.320]  it's absolute insanity
[3:13:56.320 --> 3:13:58.320]  well that was my next question
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:00.320]  go over some of the tricks they use
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:02.320]  to cook the books because I
[3:14:02.320 --> 3:14:04.320]  well that's the main one
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:06.320]  the birth-death ratio as it's called
[3:14:06.320 --> 3:14:08.320]  and in the CPI they have another thing
[3:14:08.320 --> 3:14:10.320]  called hedonics
[3:14:10.320 --> 3:14:12.320]  that's a real fancy name
[3:14:12.320 --> 3:14:14.320]  for heediness I guess
[3:14:14.320 --> 3:14:16.320]  and that figure
[3:14:16.320 --> 3:14:18.320]  what it belongs to is this
[3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:20.320]  somebody goes to the store
[3:14:20.320 --> 3:14:22.320]  and they want to buy a pound of steak
[3:14:22.320 --> 3:14:24.320]  and it costs $5
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:26.320]  they say I'm not going to pay $5
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:28.320]  I'm going to go over there and get that
[3:14:28.320 --> 3:14:30.320]  chop meat for $3
[3:14:30.320 --> 3:14:32.320]  so they're saying
[3:14:32.320 --> 3:14:34.320]  that when prices rise
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:36.320]  people will go to
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:38.320]  lesser cuts of meat
[3:14:38.320 --> 3:14:40.320]  and get them cheaper
[3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:42.320]  thereby reducing inflation
[3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:44.320]  now if you can back into that
[3:14:44.320 --> 3:14:46.320]  thing in philosophy
[3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:48.320]  you want to be an insane asylum
[3:14:48.320 --> 3:14:50.320]  they're saying inflation
[3:14:50.320 --> 3:14:52.320]  they're saying inflation isn't bad
[3:14:52.320 --> 3:14:54.320]  because you
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:56.320]  if you can't afford a Cadillac
[3:14:56.320 --> 3:14:58.320]  or you can't afford
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:00.320]  a Ford
[3:15:00.320 --> 3:15:02.320]  you can have an old Grimlord or Pinto
[3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:04.320]  and so now the amount of money you have
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:06.320]  basically has been indexed off into
[3:15:06.320 --> 3:15:08.320]  something else it's just total crap
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:10.320]  let's take some phone calls and I want to get
[3:15:10.320 --> 3:15:12.320]  because you have a lot of expertise in this
[3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:14.320]  after we take a
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:16.320]  gamut of calls here
[3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:18.320]  Bob Chapman
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:20.320]  into banning the short
[3:15:20.320 --> 3:15:22.320]  trades for 10 days
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:24.320]  which is going to end at the end of the week
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:26.320]  and you know 700
[3:15:26.320 --> 3:15:28.320]  something financial institutions it's only banned on them
[3:15:28.320 --> 3:15:30.320]  and the way I see this is
[3:15:30.320 --> 3:15:32.320]  they have turned loose
[3:15:32.320 --> 3:15:34.320]  the financial institutions
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:36.320]  of the architects of this doom
[3:15:36.320 --> 3:15:38.320]  that we're facing
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:40.320]  they've now turned them loose on what's left
[3:15:40.320 --> 3:15:42.320]  of the real economy
[3:15:42.320 --> 3:15:44.320]  and they're now crawling all over
[3:15:44.320 --> 3:15:46.320]  what's left of the Fortune 500 that does manufacturing
[3:15:46.320 --> 3:15:48.320]  just blowing the daylights out of it
[3:15:48.320 --> 3:15:50.320]  and sabotaging it
[3:15:50.320 --> 3:15:52.320]  and gang raping it
[3:15:52.320 --> 3:15:54.320]  and climbing all over it
[3:15:54.320 --> 3:15:56.320]  and trying to short and drive down
[3:15:56.320 --> 3:15:58.320]  I mean all sorts of things going on so I want to
[3:15:58.320 --> 3:16:00.320]  talk about that with you Bob Chapman
[3:16:00.320 --> 3:16:02.320]  because this appears just to be
[3:16:02.320 --> 3:16:04.320]  not just a power grab
[3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:06.320]  but just an all out
[3:16:06.320 --> 3:16:08.320]  military assault on anything
[3:16:08.320 --> 3:16:10.320]  part of the criminal banking order
[3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:12.320]  let's go ahead and talk to Ricardo in New Jersey
[3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:14.320]  Ricardo thanks for holding
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:16.320]  you're on the air with Bob Chapman
[3:16:16.320 --> 3:16:18.320]  Ali how are you?
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:20.320]  good sir
[3:16:20.320 --> 3:16:22.320]  thank you for taking my call
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:24.320]  I want to talk to you about
[3:16:24.320 --> 3:16:26.320]  a police brutality that happened in
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:28.320]  Redback New Jersey
[3:16:28.320 --> 3:16:30.320]  okay
[3:16:30.320 --> 3:16:32.320]  last week
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:34.320]  September 10 my wife was
[3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:36.320]  she had like a small lipo
[3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:38.320]  of her arms and tie
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:40.320]  so it was like an early in the morning
[3:16:40.320 --> 3:16:42.320]  so I picked it up like a
[3:16:42.320 --> 3:16:44.320]  one o'clock she looked fine
[3:16:44.320 --> 3:16:46.320]  she looked perfect so
[3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:48.320]  she went to get my son
[3:16:48.320 --> 3:16:50.320]  it was around 2.33 o'clock
[3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:52.320]  unfortunately she got involved
[3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:54.320]  in a little fender bender
[3:16:54.320 --> 3:16:56.320]  okay what happened to your wife?
[3:16:56.320 --> 3:16:58.320]  so the
[3:16:58.320 --> 3:17:00.320]  cop took him out of the car and they told him
[3:17:00.320 --> 3:17:02.320]  listen you drunk and my wife said no
[3:17:02.320 --> 3:17:04.320]  I can't be drunk I don't drink
[3:17:04.320 --> 3:17:06.320]  yeah you smell like alcohol
[3:17:06.320 --> 3:17:08.320]  so they did the test
[3:17:08.320 --> 3:17:10.320]  and they let you know
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:12.320]  they make you blow that thing
[3:17:12.320 --> 3:17:14.320]  everything comes zero
[3:17:14.320 --> 3:17:16.320]  so all of a sudden this guy comes over
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:18.320]  grabbed it through her arms and said
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:20.320]  I just had a surgery please it hurts
[3:17:20.320 --> 3:17:22.320]  and the guy put it right
[3:17:22.320 --> 3:17:24.320]  against her car
[3:17:24.320 --> 3:17:26.320]  she started bleeding really bad
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:28.320]  well that's what Iraqis
[3:17:28.320 --> 3:17:30.320]  that's what happens to the Iraqis
[3:17:30.320 --> 3:17:32.320]  so they slammed her head in the car
[3:17:32.320 --> 3:17:34.320]  and they were holding through her arms
[3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:36.320]  and then another cop came over
[3:17:36.320 --> 3:17:38.320]  they took my son at her side
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:40.320]  my son was crying
[3:17:40.320 --> 3:17:42.320]  they put him in the car by himself
[3:17:42.320 --> 3:17:44.320]  and the officer yelled my son
[3:17:44.320 --> 3:17:46.320]  you stay in the car still today
[3:17:46.320 --> 3:17:48.320]  that my son gets up like 4 o'clock in the morning
[3:17:48.320 --> 3:17:50.320]  having a nightmare
[3:17:50.320 --> 3:17:52.320]  they're hiring men whose minds
[3:17:52.320 --> 3:17:54.320]  are completely gone from Iraq
[3:17:54.320 --> 3:17:56.320]  I'm going to hold you over if you need me
[3:17:56.320 --> 3:17:58.320]  but Bob they're now announcing army
[3:17:58.320 --> 3:18:00.320]  of your grades to patrol America as you know
[3:18:00.320 --> 3:18:02.320]  last week there now
[3:18:02.320 --> 3:18:04.320]  police brutality is just exploding everywhere
[3:18:04.320 --> 3:18:06.320]  the police have been told basically have your way
[3:18:06.320 --> 3:18:08.320]  with the public
[3:18:08.320 --> 3:18:10.320]  I mean is the government looking for a war
[3:18:10.320 --> 3:18:12.320]  Bob?
[3:18:12.320 --> 3:18:14.320]  they're looking for civil insurrection
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:16.320]  so they can put it down before
[3:18:16.320 --> 3:18:18.320]  too many people are mad enough to stop them
[3:18:18.320 --> 3:18:20.320]  and if they nip it in the bud now
[3:18:20.320 --> 3:18:22.320]  and do not allow
[3:18:22.320 --> 3:18:24.320]  the total breakdown
[3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:26.320]  financially and economically within society
[3:18:26.320 --> 3:18:28.320]  because that will make
[3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:30.320]  everybody mad at government
[3:18:30.320 --> 3:18:32.320]  and other things
[3:18:32.320 --> 3:18:34.320]  and they won't have anything
[3:18:34.320 --> 3:18:36.320]  they won't have anything to lose except their lives
[3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:38.320]  and they'll figure maybe I'll lose them anyway
[3:18:38.320 --> 3:18:40.320]  and they'll fight back so they want to get them before that
[3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:42.320]  well there's all these videos
[3:18:42.320 --> 3:18:44.320]  where the women do nothing
[3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:46.320]  they're tazored, they're beaten, they're attacked
[3:18:46.320 --> 3:18:48.320]  and it's really destroying the police name out there
[3:18:48.320 --> 3:18:50.320]  God help us
[3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:52.320]  so what ended up happening to your wife
[3:18:52.320 --> 3:18:54.320]  did they take her to jail after they beat her up?
[3:18:54.320 --> 3:18:56.320]  Ricardo?
[3:18:56.320 --> 3:18:58.320]  all of a sudden one of the cops
[3:18:58.320 --> 3:19:00.320]  they told her get in the car
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:02.320]  so
[3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:04.320]  they had it in the car and they took it to the hospital
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:06.320]  to do some urine tests
[3:19:06.320 --> 3:19:08.320]  so the officer
[3:19:08.320 --> 3:19:10.320]  told my wife you better shut up
[3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:12.320]  because I'm going to call diapers on you
[3:19:12.320 --> 3:19:14.320]  so they would throw her, they took it to the hospital
[3:19:14.320 --> 3:19:16.320]  call who on you?
[3:19:16.320 --> 3:19:18.320]  do they threaten to CPS your children?
[3:19:18.320 --> 3:19:20.320]  the officer
[3:19:20.320 --> 3:19:22.320]  threw my wife down, they were going to send
[3:19:22.320 --> 3:19:24.320]  diapers to my house
[3:19:24.320 --> 3:19:26.320]  to
[3:19:26.320 --> 3:19:28.320]  stay there, stay there, we're going to skip the break
[3:19:28.320 --> 3:19:30.320]  we're going to be talking behind the scenes
[3:19:30.320 --> 3:19:32.320]  Ricardo continue, send who? I don't understand you
[3:19:32.320 --> 3:19:34.320]  send who to your house?
[3:19:34.320 --> 3:19:36.320]  no, no, the officer
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:19:38.320]  told my wife
[3:19:38.320 --> 3:19:40.320]  he was really nasty and told my wife
[3:19:40.320 --> 3:19:42.320]  you know what? you shut up
[3:19:42.320 --> 3:19:44.320]  because I'm going to send diapers
[3:19:44.320 --> 3:19:46.320]  to your house
[3:19:46.320 --> 3:19:48.320]  what's diapers?
[3:19:48.320 --> 3:19:50.320]  diapers is when you mistreat your son
[3:19:50.320 --> 3:19:52.320]  no, I knew it, I knew it, that's how they beat you up
[3:19:52.320 --> 3:19:54.320]  then they steal your children
[3:19:54.320 --> 3:19:56.320]  God help you
[3:19:56.320 --> 3:19:58.320]  so what, he was mad that she hadn't been drinking
[3:19:58.320 --> 3:20:00.320]  so he decided to beat her up
[3:20:00.320 --> 3:20:02.320]  and then how did this end?
[3:20:02.320 --> 3:20:04.320]  you know, my wife didn't drink
[3:20:04.320 --> 3:20:06.320]  she had a surgery in a
[3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:08.320]  you know, and they gave her some local
[3:20:08.320 --> 3:20:10.320]  no, no, no, I mean I understand
[3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:12.320]  there's big articles where people go to the dentist
[3:20:12.320 --> 3:20:14.320]  and they CPS their kids
[3:20:14.320 --> 3:20:16.320]  so tell me
[3:20:16.320 --> 3:20:18.320]  they took her to the hospital
[3:20:18.320 --> 3:20:20.320]  because they want to do some kind of test
[3:20:20.320 --> 3:20:22.320]  and this guy tells
[3:20:22.320 --> 3:20:24.320]  my wife is a small thing
[3:20:24.320 --> 3:20:26.320]  she's 5'2", 120 pounds
[3:20:26.320 --> 3:20:28.320]  that guy was 6'4", 6'5", at least
[3:20:28.320 --> 3:20:30.320]  300 pounds
[3:20:30.320 --> 3:20:32.320]  two guys
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:34.320]  so my wife was desperate to find out
[3:20:34.320 --> 3:20:36.320]  that was my son, I'm trying
[3:20:36.320 --> 3:20:38.320]  so the guy told my wife
[3:20:38.320 --> 3:20:40.320]  sit right there, my wife said
[3:20:40.320 --> 3:20:42.320]  I cannot see, it hurts
[3:20:42.320 --> 3:20:44.320]  and you already destroyed me
[3:20:44.320 --> 3:20:46.320]  so all of a sudden
[3:20:46.320 --> 3:20:48.320]  she gets up and the guy jumps
[3:20:48.320 --> 3:20:50.320]  up at her and they
[3:20:50.320 --> 3:20:52.320]  broke all the stitches in her leg
[3:20:52.320 --> 3:20:54.320]  she started bleeding unstoppable
[3:20:54.320 --> 3:20:56.320]  and the son of my god they would tell me
[3:20:56.320 --> 3:20:58.320]  yeah, your wife is a headquarter
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:21:00.320]  and I was a headquarter waiting for her like an idiot
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:02.320]  while she was in the hospital
[3:21:02.320 --> 3:21:04.320]  all of a sudden I get an anonymous call from the hospital
[3:21:04.320 --> 3:21:06.320]  saying
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:08.320]  your wife is in this hospital
[3:21:08.320 --> 3:21:10.320]  come over to the hospital
[3:21:10.320 --> 3:21:12.320]  so I told the guy, well you've been lying to me
[3:21:12.320 --> 3:21:14.320]  my wife is not in the headquarter
[3:21:14.320 --> 3:21:16.320]  she's at the hospital
[3:21:16.320 --> 3:21:18.320]  I knew that I was on my way to the hospital
[3:21:18.320 --> 3:21:20.320]  lying to the American people is like part of the game
[3:21:20.320 --> 3:21:22.320]  it's like a cat playing with a mouse
[3:21:22.320 --> 3:21:24.320]  your pain is nothing but pleasure
[3:21:24.320 --> 3:21:26.320]  for these demons of hell
[3:21:26.320 --> 3:21:28.320]  rapidly, now
[3:21:28.320 --> 3:21:30.320]  how did all this end, they didn't kidnap your son
[3:21:30.320 --> 3:21:32.320]  did they?
[3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:34.320]  no, no, they gave me my son
[3:21:34.320 --> 3:21:36.320]  and
[3:21:36.320 --> 3:21:38.320]  they gave her a DWI ticket
[3:21:40.320 --> 3:21:42.320]  you see when somebody
[3:21:42.320 --> 3:21:44.320]  they want to get you in the system
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:46.320]  they want to get you for the national debt
[3:21:46.320 --> 3:21:48.320]  is as a slave, by getting you into the criminal system
[3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:50.320]  you are now their slave
[3:21:50.320 --> 3:21:52.320]  here in this life
[3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:54.320]  and New Jersey
[3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:56.320]  sir is one of the worst, Florida is very bad
[3:21:56.320 --> 3:21:58.320]  New York
[3:21:58.320 --> 3:22:00.320]  is very bad, Michigan is very bad
[3:22:00.320 --> 3:22:02.320]  California is very bad
[3:22:02.320 --> 3:22:04.320]  if I was you I would flee New Jersey
[3:22:06.320 --> 3:22:08.320]  so Bob Chapman
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:10.320]  you want to comment on this?
[3:22:10.320 --> 3:22:12.320]  it's terrifying, it's heartbreaking
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:14.320]  it goes on
[3:22:14.320 --> 3:22:16.320]  all day, every day
[3:22:16.320 --> 3:22:18.320]  and I don't know whether finding these people
[3:22:18.320 --> 3:22:20.320]  to hire on the police departments
[3:22:20.320 --> 3:22:22.320]  but they're not there to protect and serve
[3:22:24.320 --> 3:22:26.320]  they're there to pick on people
[3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:28.320]  make arrests
[3:22:28.320 --> 3:22:30.320]  particularly on minorities
[3:22:30.320 --> 3:22:32.320]  there's no question
[3:22:32.320 --> 3:22:34.320]  there's many racists in our society
[3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:36.320]  and some of them happen to be policemen as well
[3:22:38.320 --> 3:22:40.320]  and
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:42.320]  you know in the states where you can
[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:46.320]  get a license to carry
[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:48.320]  and they pull that crap
[3:22:48.320 --> 3:22:50.320]  shoot them
[3:22:50.320 --> 3:22:52.320]  well Bob
[3:22:52.320 --> 3:22:54.320]  that's an interesting perspective on that
[3:22:54.320 --> 3:22:56.320]  what else are you going to do if you're being attacked?
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:22:58.320]  well you go to the FEMA camp
[3:22:58.320 --> 3:23:00.320]  you hand your children over to them
[3:23:00.320 --> 3:23:02.320]  you let them ship the drugs in
[3:23:02.320 --> 3:23:04.320]  I never in the last
[3:23:04.320 --> 3:23:06.320]  40 years in the United States
[3:23:06.320 --> 3:23:08.320]  I never
[3:23:08.320 --> 3:23:10.320]  in my children when they became 12 years old
[3:23:10.320 --> 3:23:12.320]  never
[3:23:12.320 --> 3:23:14.320]  when a day without carrying a weapon
[3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:16.320]  well Bob I just think it's wrong
[3:23:16.320 --> 3:23:18.320]  the founding fathers were bad like the government says
[3:23:18.320 --> 3:23:20.320]  like FEMA teaches
[3:23:20.320 --> 3:23:22.320]  we should just submit to any level of tyranny or anything evil
[3:23:22.320 --> 3:23:24.320]  that's what freedom is all about
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:26.320]  this is the land of enslavement
[3:23:26.320 --> 3:23:28.320]  the land of tears
[3:23:28.320 --> 3:23:30.320]  how dare you conspiracy theory that it's the land of the free
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:32.320]  home of the brave
[3:23:32.320 --> 3:23:34.320]  it's very extreme and sickening
[3:23:34.320 --> 3:23:36.320]  I'm very ashamed of you
[3:23:36.320 --> 3:23:38.320]  what else are you going to do
[3:23:38.320 --> 3:23:43.460]  if Schwab or
[3:23:43.460 --> 3:23:45.460]  I don't know
[3:23:50.960 --> 3:23:52.960]  all right well for those that are listening
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:55.320]  on theода
[3:23:55.320 --> 3:23:57.320]  battering his wife's head in the car
[3:23:57.320 --> 3:23:59.320]  beating masseur
[3:23:59.320 --> 3:24:01.320]  up bullet stitches from a surgery she had
[3:24:01.320 --> 3:24:03.320]  saying cps is going to take your child
[3:24:03.320 --> 3:24:05.480]  reveling in the blood
[3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:09.400]  And Ricardo, that's just par for the course.
[3:24:09.400 --> 3:24:11.840]  I mean, in Iraq, they rape children in front of their parents.
[3:24:11.840 --> 3:24:14.480]  They pour battery acid on their body parts
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:16.520]  and do things Jeffrey Dahmer did.
[3:24:16.520 --> 3:24:18.640]  I can't even mention on air official army reports.
[3:24:18.640 --> 3:24:21.240]  So there was a big article in The Chronicle this week
[3:24:21.240 --> 3:24:22.920]  about all the psycho cops.
[3:24:22.920 --> 3:24:24.680]  I mean, four or five tours.
[3:24:24.680 --> 3:24:26.120]  Hell has taken their souls.
[3:24:26.120 --> 3:24:27.600]  Some of them others just break down.
[3:24:27.600 --> 3:24:30.160]  Others still can keep their humanity.
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:33.400]  But how did all this end, Ricardo?
[3:24:33.400 --> 3:24:38.200]  They're still, you know, when the guy jumped on top of her
[3:24:38.200 --> 3:24:41.200]  at the hospital, there was a dramatic hush.
[3:24:41.200 --> 3:24:44.240]  You know, there was some social workers there.
[3:24:44.240 --> 3:24:47.960]  They, and everybody was in shock at the hospital.
[3:24:47.960 --> 3:24:52.560]  So the social workers didn't, were not vampiric.
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:53.520]  They didn't go after you.
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:54.720]  Well, that's good.
[3:24:54.720 --> 3:24:57.520]  No, they tried to help them out actually.
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:24:59.640]  And but the bothers me, they didn't
[3:24:59.640 --> 3:25:01.640]  knew when to tell me where she was.
[3:25:01.640 --> 3:25:04.080]  She was at the hospital, they tell me.
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:06.720]  Well, that's the good news is that not all the social workers
[3:25:06.720 --> 3:25:07.920]  are bad.
[3:25:07.920 --> 3:25:09.360]  And more and more of them are waking up.
[3:25:09.360 --> 3:25:11.120]  That's why they have 50% turnaround
[3:25:11.120 --> 3:25:12.440]  with new social workers.
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:14.400]  Half of them just say, I can't do this.
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:17.440]  And there are actually good divisions of social workers.
[3:25:17.440 --> 3:25:19.760]  It's just the system is corrupt and bad.
[3:25:19.760 --> 3:25:23.760]  Ricardo, did your wife get out of the hospital?
[3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:25.960]  Yes, she got out of the hospital.
[3:25:25.960 --> 3:25:28.520]  Psychological Alex, she's destroyed.
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:30.440]  She will not dry.
[3:25:30.440 --> 3:25:33.720]  My son gets up like 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning,
[3:25:33.720 --> 3:25:35.040]  crying, shaking.
[3:25:35.040 --> 3:25:36.080]  Well, that's why they do it.
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:39.800]  It's to let you know, sit down, shut up.
[3:25:39.800 --> 3:25:41.920]  The Congress has been told, sit down and shut up.
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:43.840]  The army brigades are here.
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:45.320]  And it's, it's disgusting.
[3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:46.840]  Listen, Ricardo, I appreciate your call.
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:47.920]  We'll pray for you and your wife.
[3:25:47.920 --> 3:25:49.360]  What's your wife's name?
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:50.120]  Irma.
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:52.080]  Irma, OK, Ricardo, take care.
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:54.640]  Bob, you know, this is the one thing I don't like about this show.
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:25:57.240]  I have stacks of news of government corruption.
[3:25:57.240 --> 3:25:59.760]  And people think I'm trying to make the government look bad.
[3:25:59.760 --> 3:26:03.840]  No, I can't bring myself half the time to even cover it.
[3:26:03.840 --> 3:26:08.200]  And I know it's, it's true and worse than Ricardo
[3:26:08.200 --> 3:26:09.240]  could even describe.
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:12.320]  And I don't even hate these people anymore.
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:16.360]  I am just so disgusted that we have a nation of men
[3:26:16.360 --> 3:26:17.760]  that aren't manly.
[3:26:17.760 --> 3:26:21.640]  I mean, a real man doesn't enjoy beating the hell out of women.
[3:26:21.640 --> 3:26:25.160]  A real man doesn't enjoy fighting people that are weak.
[3:26:25.160 --> 3:26:27.680]  A real man, you know, doesn't like fighting.
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:29.800]  But if they have to, you know, that men are warriors.
[3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:31.800]  They want to fight other warriors.
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:36.320]  And it's just, I don't know, it's these emasculated, tough guys
[3:26:36.320 --> 3:26:38.880]  that watch, you know, fake wrestling growing up.
[3:26:38.880 --> 3:26:40.280]  They play the violent video games,
[3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:42.080]  and they go to the military and get brainwashed.
[3:26:42.080 --> 3:26:44.120]  And they just, they're mad dogs.
[3:26:44.120 --> 3:26:46.800]  Bob Chapman, you want to speak to that?
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:48.600]  No, I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:51.800]  And, and, you know, many of these men
[3:26:51.800 --> 3:26:54.440]  have been in three or four tours over there.
[3:26:54.440 --> 3:26:58.880]  And, you know, what else do we expect them to come back as?
[3:26:58.880 --> 3:27:01.560]  I mean, if their lives have been in jeopardy all day long,
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:04.200]  every day, every time they're out there,
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:07.120]  their adrenaline's pumping 100 miles an hour.
[3:27:07.120 --> 3:27:09.640]  And it, you know, by the time they're in their 30s,
[3:27:09.640 --> 3:27:13.000]  they're totally physically and mentally burned out.
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:16.520]  And obviously, police departments are hiring them.
[3:27:16.520 --> 3:27:19.800]  And so it's not unusual to have things like this happen.
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:22.520]  It's, it's because we shouldn't have had a war
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:23.880]  in the first place.
[3:27:23.880 --> 3:27:25.040]  And if we were going to have a war,
[3:27:25.040 --> 3:27:27.000]  at least we should have sent enough people
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.240]  to be able to do what we have to do.
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:30.240]  Well, I'm going to say this.
[3:27:30.240 --> 3:27:31.080]  They didn't do that.
[3:27:31.080 --> 3:27:33.160]  Yeah, I'm going to say this.
[3:27:33.160 --> 3:27:35.920]  And it's happening more and more.
[3:27:35.920 --> 3:27:38.720]  Nobody better ever do anything to my children
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:41.520]  because I just can't, I can't control myself.
[3:27:41.520 --> 3:27:43.160]  And, and, and I think the police know
[3:27:43.160 --> 3:27:44.640]  that's starting to happen with people.
[3:27:44.640 --> 3:27:46.680]  I mean, you can only push so far.
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:49.760]  And so what do you say to that, Bob?
[3:27:49.760 --> 3:27:54.760]  If anybody laid a, just a hand, one of my children
[3:27:54.760 --> 3:27:56.920]  or tried to do anything to them,
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:27:59.560]  of course they're older now, the your age,
[3:28:01.080 --> 3:28:03.080]  they better go into hiding
[3:28:03.080 --> 3:28:04.920]  because I ain't taken any prisoners.
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:08.200]  And if I go to jail for the rest of my life
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:11.760]  or I get hung, that's the price I got to pay.
[3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:13.520]  But I'm taking them down.
[3:28:13.520 --> 3:28:16.000]  Well, that's the attitude that made this country gray.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:17.640]  And that when tyrants are afraid,
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:19.280]  they're not afraid anymore.
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:20.360]  And Bob, I don't think these,
[3:28:20.360 --> 3:28:22.000]  I think the establishment does realize at the top
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:23.880]  at low level, I don't think these bullies
[3:28:23.880 --> 3:28:25.080]  realize what's rising.
[3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:27.200]  I don't think they understand what is,
[3:28:27.200 --> 3:28:30.800]  what is waiting behind just a thin wall, a thin line,
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:32.920]  just, just, just waiting on the other side.
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:34.920]  I don't think they have any idea, Bob.
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:37.240]  Well, I know there's going to be trouble,
[3:28:37.240 --> 3:28:38.560]  but they think they can handle it,
[3:28:38.560 --> 3:28:40.800]  just like they thought they could handle
[3:28:40.800 --> 3:28:43.080]  the last corrupt bubble on Wall Street,
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:44.600]  which was the real estate bubble.
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:47.000]  Or just like they thought the whole Israeli,
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:47.840]  or just like the Israel.
[3:28:47.840 --> 3:28:50.320]  And certainly those guys on television today,
[3:28:50.320 --> 3:28:53.400]  they've been wrong about everything.
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:28:55.000]  There's nothing they've been right about.
[3:28:55.000 --> 3:28:57.240]  Well, Bob, they also thought that the entire
[3:28:57.240 --> 3:29:00.240]  Israeli military can handle a few Hezbollah
[3:29:00.240 --> 3:29:01.520]  and checkerboard foundations.
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:03.480]  But those guys said, we're not retreating,
[3:29:03.480 --> 3:29:05.520]  we're not backing off, we're going all the way,
[3:29:05.520 --> 3:29:07.240]  and you just can't stop people that are like that,
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:08.400]  can you, Bob?
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:09.240]  No, you can't.
[3:29:09.240 --> 3:29:11.560]  And you're fighting on their territory.
[3:29:11.560 --> 3:29:14.680]  And, you know, the Israelis have not told us the truth.
[3:29:14.680 --> 3:29:16.000]  Stay there, we're going to skip this break.
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:17.760]  We're going to skip this for info or stream listeners.
[3:29:17.760 --> 3:29:18.600]  Here we go.
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:21.920]  Bob, go ahead and make your point about how they,
[3:29:21.920 --> 3:29:24.040]  I mean, they've quote been wrong about everything.
[3:29:24.040 --> 3:29:25.480]  I mean, they're the authors of this,
[3:29:25.480 --> 3:29:27.960]  and they're going to the Israeli thing, go ahead.
[3:29:27.960 --> 3:29:31.640]  And the invasion of Lebanon,
[3:29:31.640 --> 3:29:34.640]  they just got the crap kicked out of them.
[3:29:34.640 --> 3:29:39.640]  And then in the last 72 hours before the declared truce,
[3:29:42.320 --> 3:29:46.600]  they dropped thousands and thousands of these bombs
[3:29:46.600 --> 3:29:51.600]  with the things that go out that hang in trees
[3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:53.360]  and are on the ground.
[3:29:53.360 --> 3:29:54.200]  What do they call them?
[3:29:54.200 --> 3:29:57.000]  Cluster bombs, and they also use nerve gas.
[3:29:57.000 --> 3:30:00.400]  And all they're killing today is innocent civilians.
[3:30:00.400 --> 3:30:02.120]  Children will pick them up on the street
[3:30:02.120 --> 3:30:05.960]  and get blown up in farmers who are out in the fields
[3:30:05.960 --> 3:30:09.000]  and touch one and they don't have any legs anymore.
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:11.540]  And it's horrible what they did.
[3:30:11.540 --> 3:30:16.540]  Well, they also used admittedly nerve gas from artillery.
[3:30:19.180 --> 3:30:20.820]  Artillery delivered nerve gas,
[3:30:20.820 --> 3:30:23.220]  and then that still didn't work.
[3:30:23.220 --> 3:30:26.420]  I just, God help us, man, God help us.
[3:30:26.420 --> 3:30:29.460]  Because the New World Order could care less
[3:30:29.460 --> 3:30:30.620]  about the police and military.
[3:30:30.620 --> 3:30:32.460]  I mean, they don't care if we get into some shooting
[3:30:32.460 --> 3:30:33.300]  or with them.
[3:30:33.300 --> 3:30:37.300]  In fact, that's part of the larger I-4 plan.
[3:30:37.300 --> 3:30:42.260]  Speaking of the bankers, we're gonna come back and take calls.
[3:30:42.260 --> 3:30:43.660]  We're still in the air right now, though,
[3:30:43.660 --> 3:30:44.820]  to the internet audience.
[3:30:44.820 --> 3:30:49.220]  Bob, you say that they planned this economic collapse,
[3:30:49.220 --> 3:30:52.340]  but it came too early and it's out of control for them.
[3:30:52.340 --> 3:30:55.820]  Is it even more out of control for the establishment now, Bob?
[3:30:55.820 --> 3:30:56.820]  I think it is.
[3:30:56.820 --> 3:31:01.820]  I think that having to act economically with no way out,
[3:31:03.460 --> 3:31:07.060]  no way to go back has really stuck them
[3:31:07.060 --> 3:31:09.980]  and even knowing that,
[3:31:09.980 --> 3:31:11.580]  and they know more about this than I do,
[3:31:11.580 --> 3:31:13.020]  because they planned it,
[3:31:13.020 --> 3:31:15.700]  even knowing that they still went ahead
[3:31:15.700 --> 3:31:17.620]  with the real estate bubble
[3:31:17.620 --> 3:31:22.220]  and the securitization of mortgages gouging,
[3:31:22.220 --> 3:31:23.580]  not only the public,
[3:31:24.620 --> 3:31:27.980]  but particularly other bankers in other countries.
[3:31:27.980 --> 3:31:31.860]  You know, 48% of that toxic waste was bought
[3:31:31.860 --> 3:31:34.220]  by bankers in Europe.
[3:31:34.220 --> 3:31:36.540]  Never mind how much was bought in Asia.
[3:31:36.540 --> 3:31:39.620]  And we'll guess it, 55%.
[3:31:39.620 --> 3:31:43.300]  So what they did is they laid the paper on these people
[3:31:43.300 --> 3:31:47.180]  and then they laid the rest of it off in the United States
[3:31:47.180 --> 3:31:49.020]  into what they couldn't lay off,
[3:31:49.020 --> 3:31:51.580]  because what happened is,
[3:31:51.580 --> 3:31:53.020]  Merritt the Whitney came out and said,
[3:31:53.020 --> 3:31:55.300]  well, Citigroup isn't worth what they say it is
[3:31:55.300 --> 3:31:56.580]  because of this and that,
[3:31:56.580 --> 3:31:58.260]  and that started the ball rolling
[3:31:58.260 --> 3:32:01.780]  an untoward event that they never thought would happen.
[3:32:01.780 --> 3:32:03.060]  And it happened,
[3:32:03.060 --> 3:32:05.980]  and that just really complicated things for them,
[3:32:05.980 --> 3:32:09.260]  because that brought on the credit crisis.
[3:32:09.260 --> 3:32:14.260]  And so, yes, they've got serious, serious unsolvable problems.
[3:32:15.260 --> 3:32:18.100]  And then they troop these people up
[3:32:18.100 --> 3:32:19.500]  and tell us how smart they are.
[3:32:19.500 --> 3:32:21.420]  I wanna tell you something.
[3:32:21.420 --> 3:32:26.420]  My score in the SAT was 1595 out of a 1600.
[3:32:26.900 --> 3:32:29.580]  So they are not any smarter than I am.
[3:32:29.580 --> 3:32:31.820]  And we know what they're doing.
[3:32:31.820 --> 3:32:33.900]  And we're gonna catch them at it.
[3:32:33.900 --> 3:32:35.260]  And we're gonna try them.
[3:32:35.260 --> 3:32:36.100]  Stay there.
[3:32:36.100 --> 3:32:37.420]  We're coming back to the full audience.
[3:32:37.420 --> 3:32:38.260]  Stay there.
[3:32:42.460 --> 3:32:43.300]  Welcome back.
[3:32:43.300 --> 3:32:44.780]  Bob Chapman was just going over the fact
[3:32:44.780 --> 3:32:47.100]  that the Neural Order folks are not invincible.
[3:32:49.020 --> 3:32:50.180]  And he was saying they're gonna be caught,
[3:32:50.180 --> 3:32:51.660]  they're gonna be tried, they're gonna be brought to justice.
[3:32:51.660 --> 3:32:53.220]  Ron Paul was saying that
[3:32:53.220 --> 3:32:55.100]  former Fed chairman needs to be arrested
[3:32:55.100 --> 3:32:56.100]  in the current one.
[3:32:56.100 --> 3:32:58.500]  That's a headline we need at prisonplanet.com
[3:32:58.500 --> 3:33:00.300]  and infowars.com.
[3:33:00.300 --> 3:33:01.700]  That's a fireball out there.
[3:33:01.700 --> 3:33:02.940]  And that's the kind of talk we need
[3:33:02.940 --> 3:33:04.300]  to punish these people.
[3:33:04.300 --> 3:33:06.380]  And then that'll bring confidence back in the markets.
[3:33:06.380 --> 3:33:07.940]  Bob, you were talking about people not trusting
[3:33:07.940 --> 3:33:10.060]  as then we're going to Cole, Brian, Christopher, Jamie
[3:33:10.060 --> 3:33:11.500]  and others.
[3:33:11.500 --> 3:33:14.220]  The Chinese are no longer doing interbank lending
[3:33:14.220 --> 3:33:15.780]  with the United States.
[3:33:15.780 --> 3:33:17.940]  Germany and Reuters, their government's saying
[3:33:17.940 --> 3:33:20.060]  the US is collapsing.
[3:33:20.060 --> 3:33:21.940]  We'll lose its financial superpower status.
[3:33:21.940 --> 3:33:23.540]  I mean, it's happening.
[3:33:23.540 --> 3:33:26.540]  Bailout or no, it looks like it's going.
[3:33:26.540 --> 3:33:29.020]  And I don't know if it's gonna be two years, Bob.
[3:33:29.020 --> 3:33:31.620]  And we've got just on and on in here.
[3:33:31.620 --> 3:33:34.700]  What do you say to this report out of AP,
[3:33:34.700 --> 3:33:39.700]  on Salah to Shanghai, that China, here's a Reuters,
[3:33:40.460 --> 3:33:44.260]  China banks told to halt lending to US banks, SCMP.
[3:33:44.260 --> 3:33:46.580]  I mean, break that down technically for folks.
[3:33:48.780 --> 3:33:49.820]  SCMP?
[3:33:49.820 --> 3:33:50.660]  Yes.
[3:33:50.660 --> 3:33:52.100]  Well, I mean, break down the fact
[3:33:52.100 --> 3:33:54.780]  that Germany's talking about may suspend lending
[3:33:54.780 --> 3:33:57.820]  and then China's saying they are halting lending.
[3:33:57.820 --> 3:34:00.660]  Alex, we can sum it up very quickly
[3:34:00.660 --> 3:34:02.840]  and say, what took them so long?
[3:34:04.340 --> 3:34:06.900]  I mean, they've known this has been going on.
[3:34:06.900 --> 3:34:08.980]  You know, they're probably saying to one another
[3:34:08.980 --> 3:34:11.340]  in China and in Frankfurt and Paris,
[3:34:13.700 --> 3:34:16.340]  you know, how long are we gonna put up with this?
[3:34:16.340 --> 3:34:18.700]  Enough already.
[3:34:18.700 --> 3:34:19.740]  We don't need it.
[3:34:20.700 --> 3:34:23.060]  And they're burying every other country.
[3:34:24.100 --> 3:34:26.540]  All the bail themselves out.
[3:34:26.540 --> 3:34:29.340]  And you know, they've gotten away with it time after time
[3:34:29.340 --> 3:34:32.740]  because of the Fed control and who owns the Fed.
[3:34:32.740 --> 3:34:34.860]  And they think they can get away with it again.
[3:34:34.860 --> 3:34:37.340]  And there is protest.
[3:34:37.340 --> 3:34:42.340]  Whether it will evolve into an active situation
[3:34:42.940 --> 3:34:47.940]  where the Chinese don't buy treasury paper
[3:34:48.300 --> 3:34:51.340]  or any other agency paper or any other paper
[3:34:51.340 --> 3:34:56.340]  from the US government or Europeans do that, I don't know.
[3:34:56.340 --> 3:34:59.100]  I've been waiting for it to happen for several years
[3:34:59.100 --> 3:35:00.780]  and it hasn't happened.
[3:35:00.780 --> 3:35:02.860]  So I don't know what it's gonna happen.
[3:35:03.260 --> 3:35:05.020]  But you know, the constituents,
[3:35:05.020 --> 3:35:07.460]  the citizens of those countries,
[3:35:07.460 --> 3:35:08.780]  they've got to be saying to the government,
[3:35:08.780 --> 3:35:11.220]  look, you know, they're gonna destroy us.
[3:35:12.900 --> 3:35:16.100]  And so something is gonna happen and it's starting to happen.
[3:35:16.100 --> 3:35:19.180]  And when it starts to happen, you have that breakdown.
[3:35:20.180 --> 3:35:24.220]  And I think in time, if it happened quickly,
[3:35:24.220 --> 3:35:26.420]  I think that the United States would be forced
[3:35:26.420 --> 3:35:28.100]  to walk away from their debt.
[3:35:28.100 --> 3:35:29.900]  They would have to renege on it.
[3:35:30.740 --> 3:35:32.300]  They would have to go bankrupt.
[3:35:33.100 --> 3:35:35.100]  I don't see any other way out for them.
[3:35:35.900 --> 3:35:37.500]  And that means people throughout the world
[3:35:37.500 --> 3:35:38.580]  wouldn't take the dollar.
[3:35:39.980 --> 3:35:43.180]  I mean, they would have to have some sort of a medium
[3:35:43.180 --> 3:35:45.580]  of exchange that people could trust.
[3:35:46.220 --> 3:35:48.860]  And the backing on that medium of exchange
[3:35:48.860 --> 3:35:51.420]  would have to be someplace outside the United States,
[3:35:51.420 --> 3:35:53.820]  say, in a neutral country like Switzerland.
[3:35:53.820 --> 3:35:54.900]  Switzerland or Sweden.
[3:35:56.540 --> 3:36:01.900]  And they would have to probably start a new currency order.
[3:36:03.020 --> 3:36:05.180]  And all of the currency that they had before
[3:36:05.180 --> 3:36:05.860]  would be worthless.
[3:36:05.860 --> 3:36:09.060]  Well, that's what China, India, Russia
[3:36:09.060 --> 3:36:10.940]  are talking about a new cooperative,
[3:36:10.940 --> 3:36:14.140]  the Ring of Other Nations, a new world order system.
[3:36:15.100 --> 3:36:17.780]  They're calling it the new world order with a new currency.
[3:36:18.380 --> 3:36:21.700]  And Europe's talking about maybe allying with that.
[3:36:21.700 --> 3:36:23.300]  This looks like it was planned to me
[3:36:23.300 --> 3:36:24.300]  to bring the US down.
[3:36:24.300 --> 3:36:26.620]  The deindustrialization, the setup,
[3:36:26.620 --> 3:36:29.740]  the CIA releasing the torture photos,
[3:36:29.740 --> 3:36:32.180]  making 9-11 so sloppy where it was obvious
[3:36:32.180 --> 3:36:34.940]  the government did it, to then be blamed on the US,
[3:36:34.940 --> 3:36:37.980]  not on the globalist hand inserted
[3:36:37.980 --> 3:36:39.820]  into the Anglo-American system.
[3:36:39.820 --> 3:36:41.940]  I mean, Bob, don't you smell and see,
[3:36:41.940 --> 3:36:43.940]  and I saw this in some of their documents,
[3:36:43.940 --> 3:36:46.300]  pieces of this, a plan to set us up,
[3:36:46.300 --> 3:36:48.900]  or are you saying they're not that big of a virtuoso?
[3:36:48.900 --> 3:36:52.300]  Well, I think it was surprising
[3:36:52.300 --> 3:36:54.380]  that China said what they said,
[3:36:54.380 --> 3:36:57.580]  and they were going along with the program, so to speak,
[3:36:57.580 --> 3:36:59.180]  and they had to know what was going on.
[3:36:59.180 --> 3:37:00.180]  They're not dumb.
[3:37:00.180 --> 3:37:04.020]  And so, maybe this is a part of a larger plan.
[3:37:04.020 --> 3:37:08.460]  And, you know, maybe if the United States
[3:37:08.460 --> 3:37:10.100]  were to have insurrection,
[3:37:10.100 --> 3:37:12.900]  maybe they would invite foreign troops
[3:37:12.900 --> 3:37:16.740]  then to quell this uprising that can't be controlled
[3:37:16.740 --> 3:37:20.420]  by the American military,
[3:37:20.420 --> 3:37:23.900]  because 80% of them probably wouldn't shoot
[3:37:23.900 --> 3:37:24.900]  at their own citizens.
[3:37:24.900 --> 3:37:25.740]  Well, that's the thing.
[3:37:25.740 --> 3:37:27.980]  I mean, the people running the system are not stupid,
[3:37:27.980 --> 3:37:30.140]  and they know putting cops in black uniforms
[3:37:30.140 --> 3:37:31.940]  and telling them, get rough with the public,
[3:37:31.940 --> 3:37:34.260]  and then that goes out all over TV and the web.
[3:37:34.260 --> 3:37:36.940]  I mean, they know that this is setting the police
[3:37:36.940 --> 3:37:38.420]  and military up.
[3:37:38.420 --> 3:37:40.340]  I mean, they've got to know that the military
[3:37:40.340 --> 3:37:42.460]  and the police, if they go up against the American people
[3:37:42.460 --> 3:37:45.780]  and 1% fight back, that they're gonna get their butts kicked.
[3:37:45.780 --> 3:37:49.060]  I mean, 1% of the gun owners is over 100 million,
[3:37:49.060 --> 3:37:52.580]  over 1 million combatants out of that 100 million.
[3:37:52.580 --> 3:37:55.940]  My God, I mean, it's like, Mark.
[3:37:55.940 --> 3:37:56.980]  They don't stand a chance.
[3:37:56.980 --> 3:38:01.980]  And it could evolve where this new world order philosophy,
[3:38:03.140 --> 3:38:06.100]  we would have a president, one of these two jamokes
[3:38:06.100 --> 3:38:09.180]  that are running for the office right now,
[3:38:09.180 --> 3:38:13.140]  and they could invite the UN to bring in troops.
[3:38:13.140 --> 3:38:15.500]  And, well, I mean, Canada actually signed a deal.
[3:38:15.500 --> 3:38:17.540]  They have to fight the American military
[3:38:17.540 --> 3:38:18.740]  along with the public.
[3:38:18.740 --> 3:38:22.180]  Well, the United, yeah, going into global receivership.
[3:38:22.180 --> 3:38:24.180]  And you know something I've said for years,
[3:38:24.180 --> 3:38:26.500]  blue helmets make great targets.
[3:38:26.500 --> 3:38:28.420]  Well, God knows what's gonna happen.
[3:38:28.420 --> 3:38:31.180]  The point is, quietly a decade ago,
[3:38:31.180 --> 3:38:32.860]  they signed deals with Mexico and Canada
[3:38:32.860 --> 3:38:34.940]  to use troops, quote, to deal with American terrorists
[3:38:34.940 --> 3:38:37.740]  and for violence, break down a society.
[3:38:37.740 --> 3:38:39.060]  Civil unrest is the word.
[3:38:40.100 --> 3:38:41.700]  Now they signed a deal publicly,
[3:38:41.700 --> 3:38:43.620]  remember in January of this year,
[3:38:43.620 --> 3:38:45.700]  up in Canada with Mexican and Canadian troops
[3:38:45.700 --> 3:38:48.380]  to, quote, use them in the US for emergencies.
[3:38:48.380 --> 3:38:51.660]  And then the Congress said, hey, we didn't authorize that.
[3:38:51.660 --> 3:38:53.660]  The North Com just said, go to hell.
[3:38:54.580 --> 3:38:57.900]  So, folks, I know it all sounds crazy,
[3:38:57.900 --> 3:38:59.380]  but what's happening now sounds crazy.
[3:38:59.380 --> 3:39:01.380]  You can't make this stuff up.
[3:39:01.380 --> 3:39:02.220]  Let's take some calls.
[3:39:02.220 --> 3:39:04.660]  I don't wanna get into some other financial issues
[3:39:04.660 --> 3:39:05.500]  with Bob Chapman.
[3:39:05.500 --> 3:39:07.740]  We'll also tell you to get his newsletter before he leaves us.
[3:39:07.740 --> 3:39:10.380]  Cole in Florida, go ahead, Cole.
[3:39:10.380 --> 3:39:11.220]  How you doing, Alex?
[3:39:11.220 --> 3:39:12.340]  Thanks for waking me up.
[3:39:12.340 --> 3:39:14.100]  And you're a modern-day Morpheus.
[3:39:15.420 --> 3:39:17.700]  I wanted to bring attention to a show
[3:39:17.700 --> 3:39:18.940]  I called in early this week,
[3:39:18.940 --> 3:39:20.740]  and they had a talking point,
[3:39:20.740 --> 3:39:23.860]  talking about an October surprise from Al Qaeda.
[3:39:23.860 --> 3:39:27.940]  And I brought up some good points to the show,
[3:39:27.940 --> 3:39:31.180]  which is 100.7 FMWFLA, the morning show
[3:39:31.180 --> 3:39:33.500]  with Preston, Scott, and Eric Hager.
[3:39:33.500 --> 3:39:34.700]  And I brought up the big new,
[3:39:34.700 --> 3:39:36.660]  Brzezinski and a couple other facts
[3:39:36.660 --> 3:39:39.860]  about the North Woods documents and the Gulf of Tonking.
[3:39:39.860 --> 3:39:43.260]  And they failed to approve their point against me,
[3:39:43.260 --> 3:39:46.100]  and they started to call me names
[3:39:46.100 --> 3:39:49.500]  and not acknowledge any of the facts that I stated.
[3:39:49.500 --> 3:39:50.580]  Well, I guess it's funny,
[3:39:50.580 --> 3:39:52.700]  and they'll just end up being homeless.
[3:39:52.700 --> 3:39:54.740]  Right, and his main thing was,
[3:39:54.740 --> 3:39:57.660]  he said, I love those truth-or-guys that call in
[3:39:57.660 --> 3:40:00.100]  and think that we created our own destruction
[3:40:00.100 --> 3:40:02.700]  and our own demise and our own terrorists.
[3:40:02.700 --> 3:40:05.100]  And I was really appalled,
[3:40:05.100 --> 3:40:06.580]  and I said, I needed to call in.
[3:40:06.580 --> 3:40:09.220]  I was real nervous about calling into the show,
[3:40:09.220 --> 3:40:11.340]  but I felt I had to call in.
[3:40:11.340 --> 3:40:14.140]  And I've been doing research for over three, four years.
[3:40:14.140 --> 3:40:17.860]  So I'm pretty well knowledgeable on what's going on here.
[3:40:17.860 --> 3:40:20.300]  And I just was calling in to congratulate you
[3:40:20.300 --> 3:40:22.700]  on what you're doing and keep up the good work.
[3:40:22.700 --> 3:40:25.500]  And the other thing I want to bring to your attention
[3:40:25.500 --> 3:40:29.220]  is Michelle Obama and Jill Biden are coming to Tallahassee,
[3:40:29.220 --> 3:40:30.660]  which is where I'm at.
[3:40:30.660 --> 3:40:32.140]  And I was thinking about confronting them,
[3:40:32.140 --> 3:40:34.620]  and I was wondering, did you have any advice?
[3:40:34.620 --> 3:40:37.420]  Well, you know, they taser some people now,
[3:40:37.420 --> 3:40:40.780]  so just be polite, but, you know, get the question out.
[3:40:40.780 --> 3:40:42.940]  And I would just, the key is,
[3:40:42.940 --> 3:40:44.220]  we know their New World Order,
[3:40:44.220 --> 3:40:46.100]  so you're not going to change their mind,
[3:40:46.100 --> 3:40:50.020]  but I don't really even know about Michelle Obama.
[3:40:50.020 --> 3:40:51.180]  I know about her husband.
[3:40:51.180 --> 3:40:52.780]  But I know about Biden.
[3:40:52.780 --> 3:40:56.220]  Boy, he's a ring-knocker, a kingpin and all this.
[3:40:57.740 --> 3:40:59.460]  I mean, I would just bring up the fact to them
[3:40:59.460 --> 3:41:00.620]  that don't betray your people.
[3:41:00.620 --> 3:41:01.940]  It's not too late to turn back
[3:41:01.940 --> 3:41:04.740]  and say no to the New World Order.
[3:41:04.740 --> 3:41:07.820]  And, you know, I would bring up to them that, you know,
[3:41:07.820 --> 3:41:11.300]  will you investigate government-sponsored terrorism?
[3:41:11.300 --> 3:41:12.980]  What do you think, Bob?
[3:41:12.980 --> 3:41:15.740]  I mean, what's an idea for Cole to ask of these people?
[3:41:16.820 --> 3:41:20.940]  Well, I think that probably the most important thing
[3:41:20.940 --> 3:41:23.860]  on people's minds right now is the economy.
[3:41:23.860 --> 3:41:28.860]  And so, you know, how are you going to produce more jobs?
[3:41:29.220 --> 3:41:31.620]  Are you going to let Wall Street get away
[3:41:31.620 --> 3:41:33.780]  with what Congress has let them get away with
[3:41:33.780 --> 3:41:37.780]  by this legislation to loot the American public?
[3:41:37.780 --> 3:41:40.100]  What is your take on that, Mr. Obama?
[3:41:42.380 --> 3:41:44.380]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[3:41:44.380 --> 3:41:45.980]  Cole, what's that radio station again?
[3:41:45.980 --> 3:41:48.940]  And maybe others in your area can call in
[3:41:48.940 --> 3:41:51.020]  the next few days and support you.
[3:41:51.020 --> 3:41:55.260]  Okay, it's 100.7 FM WFLA,
[3:41:55.260 --> 3:41:57.420]  and the show's called The Morning Show.
[3:41:57.420 --> 3:41:59.380]  And the host is, the host I confronted
[3:41:59.380 --> 3:42:01.700]  was Preston Scott and Eric Eggers.
[3:42:01.700 --> 3:42:04.220]  Well, I would also just call in and say,
[3:42:04.220 --> 3:42:07.540]  hey, it's declassified that Gulf of Tonkin was staged,
[3:42:07.540 --> 3:42:10.220]  it's declassified that USS Liberty was staged,
[3:42:10.220 --> 3:42:13.060]  and you can give them mainstream news and say,
[3:42:13.060 --> 3:42:15.380]  you know, you act like this isn't going on.
[3:42:15.380 --> 3:42:16.340]  Good to hear from you, Cole.
[3:42:16.340 --> 3:42:17.860]  Brian in Florida, you're on the air.
[3:42:17.860 --> 3:42:18.700]  Welcome.
[3:42:20.140 --> 3:42:22.260]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[3:42:22.260 --> 3:42:23.340]  You bet.
[3:42:23.340 --> 3:42:24.900]  Yeah, two questions for you.
[3:42:24.900 --> 3:42:27.060]  Actually, a question and a comment for you today.
[3:42:27.060 --> 3:42:30.380]  I just got done reading the proposed constitutional model
[3:42:30.380 --> 3:42:32.860]  for the new States of America
[3:42:32.860 --> 3:42:35.260]  by the Center for Democratic Studies.
[3:42:35.260 --> 3:42:36.500]  Are you familiar with that?
[3:42:37.500 --> 3:42:38.340]  Yes.
[3:42:38.340 --> 3:42:40.300]  In Santa Barbara, California?
[3:42:40.300 --> 3:42:41.140]  Yes, sir.
[3:42:41.140 --> 3:42:43.820]  I was wondering both of your opinions on this.
[3:42:43.820 --> 3:42:46.060]  Is this something that they might have
[3:42:46.060 --> 3:42:48.140]  waiting in the wings where they developed
[3:42:48.140 --> 3:42:50.100]  this legislation years before
[3:42:50.100 --> 3:42:51.700]  and then bring it into effect?
[3:42:51.700 --> 3:42:54.900]  Or is this just an idea they had 30 years ago?
[3:42:54.900 --> 3:42:56.420]  No, no, they already tried to run that,
[3:42:56.420 --> 3:42:57.660]  they already tried to run that through
[3:42:57.660 --> 3:42:59.420]  at the Sesquicentennial,
[3:42:59.420 --> 3:43:00.420]  if memory serves right.
[3:43:00.420 --> 3:43:04.460]  And that's a Carnegie Ford finance deal.
[3:43:04.460 --> 3:43:05.980]  I'm going from memory,
[3:43:05.980 --> 3:43:07.740]  but Bob even knows where they're located.
[3:43:07.740 --> 3:43:08.580]  Is my memory serving?
[3:43:08.580 --> 3:43:10.620]  Oh, yes, I know them well.
[3:43:11.820 --> 3:43:14.020]  We removed their bell one time.
[3:43:15.140 --> 3:43:17.260]  Oh, tell us about that, Bob, back from the wars.
[3:43:17.260 --> 3:43:19.940]  Oh, they have a bell there that they used to ring
[3:43:19.940 --> 3:43:21.140]  and everybody would come
[3:43:21.140 --> 3:43:23.260]  and they'd have their meetings, you know.
[3:43:24.260 --> 3:43:27.300]  Very, very illuminous.
[3:43:27.300 --> 3:43:31.460]  Hutchinson or Hutchins used to run the place.
[3:43:31.460 --> 3:43:36.060]  And it's an illuminous training ground
[3:43:36.060 --> 3:43:37.940]  for things of the future.
[3:43:37.940 --> 3:43:40.900]  And that's basically what it is.
[3:43:42.660 --> 3:43:44.020]  Okay, I hope that answers.
[3:43:45.460 --> 3:43:47.980]  You know, I never told my nephew that we took their bell
[3:43:47.980 --> 3:43:51.060]  because he's the assistant chief of police there.
[3:43:51.060 --> 3:43:56.060]  Oh, anyways, go ahead, Cole.
[3:43:57.380 --> 3:43:59.460]  I mean, not Brian, go ahead, Brian.
[3:43:59.460 --> 3:44:01.860]  I was just curious if you thought this was something
[3:44:01.860 --> 3:44:03.860]  they might try to institute in the future
[3:44:03.860 --> 3:44:05.420]  after they crash the economy
[3:44:05.420 --> 3:44:07.780]  and possibly try to bring this legislation in.
[3:44:07.780 --> 3:44:11.020]  Yeah, they've been trying to set up this new system.
[3:44:11.020 --> 3:44:12.580]  I remember reading over that document
[3:44:12.580 --> 3:44:13.420]  more than a decade ago,
[3:44:13.420 --> 3:44:15.500]  and I proposed it officially, didn't they,
[3:44:15.500 --> 3:44:18.380]  on the Sesquicentennial and got some government funding
[3:44:18.380 --> 3:44:20.300]  for some big, disgusting event.
[3:44:20.300 --> 3:44:22.460]  It's all foundations, usually.
[3:44:22.460 --> 3:44:23.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:44:23.300 --> 3:44:28.140]  And it's a payoff also for people who have towed the line
[3:44:28.140 --> 3:44:31.060]  and they get a nice salary and that sort of thing.
[3:44:31.060 --> 3:44:32.260]  Brian, I gotta move quick here
[3:44:32.260 --> 3:44:33.780]  because I got some other questions.
[3:44:33.780 --> 3:44:36.060]  What was your comment?
[3:44:36.060 --> 3:44:38.980]  Just very quickly, I just wanted to recommend a book
[3:44:38.980 --> 3:44:42.140]  called The Shock Doctrine, The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.
[3:44:42.140 --> 3:44:44.260]  If anybody wants to understand what's going on
[3:44:44.260 --> 3:44:45.340]  in the country right now,
[3:44:45.340 --> 3:44:47.060]  I think that pretty much lays it out.
[3:44:47.060 --> 3:44:49.220]  Yeah, The Shock Doctrine of the IMF,
[3:44:49.220 --> 3:44:50.860]  which is designed to destroy an economy
[3:44:50.860 --> 3:44:52.900]  so they can consolidate it.
[3:44:52.900 --> 3:44:57.340]  But let's go ahead and talk to Christopher in Georgia.
[3:44:57.340 --> 3:44:59.780]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman, go ahead.
[3:44:59.780 --> 3:45:02.020]  Hey, hey, how you doing, Alex?
[3:45:02.020 --> 3:45:05.340]  I just had a quick question, kind of foreclosure,
[3:45:05.340 --> 3:45:07.700]  I guess, if I could put it that way.
[3:45:07.700 --> 3:45:12.100]  And it deals with the end of Dr. Paul's fight
[3:45:12.100 --> 3:45:13.180]  for the presidency.
[3:45:14.700 --> 3:45:17.460]  If all the supporters were behind him
[3:45:17.460 --> 3:45:19.740]  until the very end, come what may,
[3:45:19.740 --> 3:45:22.420]  and we risked all the resources that we had,
[3:45:22.420 --> 3:45:25.020]  or we barely had to raise money for him
[3:45:25.020 --> 3:45:27.460]  and spread his message and wouldn't have abandoned him
[3:45:27.460 --> 3:45:30.820]  for anything, why was there not a relentless effort,
[3:45:30.820 --> 3:45:34.420]  you know, on his part or on our behalf
[3:45:34.420 --> 3:45:37.420]  to expose the voter fraud that we all suspected?
[3:45:37.420 --> 3:45:39.980]  Well, look, look, we asked Ron Paul to run.
[3:45:39.980 --> 3:45:42.500]  He's the best candidate we had, he's not perfect.
[3:45:42.500 --> 3:45:45.260]  His chief of staff died, his wife's almost dead.
[3:45:45.260 --> 3:45:47.980]  He's 73 years old and really burned out,
[3:45:47.980 --> 3:45:49.420]  okay, if you really want to know.
[3:45:49.420 --> 3:45:52.260]  He's got arthritis so bad, he can barely open up his hands.
[3:45:52.260 --> 3:45:55.900]  He does 10, 15 radio interviews a day, he's burned out,
[3:45:55.900 --> 3:45:57.580]  and there's a lot of backstabbing
[3:45:57.580 --> 3:46:00.180]  and a lot of second guessing now.
[3:46:00.180 --> 3:46:02.380]  And the point is, is that he got in the arena,
[3:46:02.380 --> 3:46:04.860]  he got bloodied, he burned himself out.
[3:46:04.860 --> 3:46:07.140]  I'm a young man and this stuff's tough on me.
[3:46:07.140 --> 3:46:09.580]  And so, I'm hearing a lot of talk shows,
[3:46:09.580 --> 3:46:12.140]  say 9-Eleven, True's Dead, Bad Mounding, Ron Paul,
[3:46:12.140 --> 3:46:14.380]  all this crap, and then other people are kind of
[3:46:14.380 --> 3:46:15.740]  mockingbird and picking that up.
[3:46:15.740 --> 3:46:18.020]  Now, I was worried about this the whole time
[3:46:18.020 --> 3:46:19.220]  because there was delusion.
[3:46:19.220 --> 3:46:21.140]  Even when he was shutting down the campaign,
[3:46:21.140 --> 3:46:23.060]  it was just a lie, it's not really over,
[3:46:23.060 --> 3:46:25.940]  and some of these people said I was lying.
[3:46:25.940 --> 3:46:28.540]  Ron Paul hadn't told me that he didn't want people
[3:46:28.540 --> 3:46:30.780]  to try to take delegates from McCain,
[3:46:30.780 --> 3:46:31.940]  and then Ron Paul had to come on there
[3:46:31.940 --> 3:46:34.980]  and say he had said that, and I was still bad.
[3:46:34.980 --> 3:46:37.620]  And I'm not bashing you here, Christopher,
[3:46:37.620 --> 3:46:40.460]  it's just Ron Paul was one person, one vehicle,
[3:46:40.460 --> 3:46:42.260]  to wake up tens of millions and energize
[3:46:42.260 --> 3:46:44.980]  the young people on campus, and we did that,
[3:46:44.980 --> 3:46:46.500]  and it was one more step in the fight.
[3:46:46.500 --> 3:46:48.400]  This is a long fight, it didn't want punch.
[3:46:48.400 --> 3:46:51.140]  It's bam, bam, bam, it goes 12 rounds,
[3:46:51.140 --> 3:46:53.900]  then it goes 12 rounds again, and it's who wants it?
[3:46:53.900 --> 3:46:54.740]  You understand that?
[3:46:54.740 --> 3:46:57.420]  It's over and over and over and over and over and over
[3:46:57.420 --> 3:46:59.060]  and over and over and you don't stop.
[3:46:59.060 --> 3:47:02.380]  It's going the distance, it's going all the way,
[3:47:02.380 --> 3:47:04.700]  it's the dedication, it's the commitment.
[3:47:04.700 --> 3:47:05.580]  You understand that?
[3:47:05.580 --> 3:47:07.940]  And for those that get in the arena,
[3:47:07.940 --> 3:47:09.500]  it's easy to imagine things,
[3:47:09.500 --> 3:47:11.460]  and I'm sure you're in the arena too.
[3:47:11.460 --> 3:47:16.460]  The point is, is that Ron Paul has done a great job,
[3:47:16.820 --> 3:47:19.100]  he's not perfect, but no one is,
[3:47:19.100 --> 3:47:21.420]  and we just need to keep our bullets down range
[3:47:21.420 --> 3:47:22.260]  on the New World Order.
[3:47:22.260 --> 3:47:23.460]  Anything else, Christopher?
[3:47:23.460 --> 3:47:28.060]  Yeah, yeah, my wife is in the Navy Reserves,
[3:47:28.900 --> 3:47:33.380]  and I was just wondering, in the event of a major
[3:47:33.380 --> 3:47:36.580]  financial crisis or depression here in this country,
[3:47:36.580 --> 3:47:39.060]  do you believe that those serving in the armed forces
[3:47:39.060 --> 3:47:44.060]  are gonna suffer from any type of a pay slash
[3:47:44.580 --> 3:47:47.100]  or I wouldn't say unemployment,
[3:47:47.100 --> 3:47:50.020]  but how would they compensate?
[3:47:50.020 --> 3:47:53.060]  They're not compensating the trips for the inflation.
[3:47:53.060 --> 3:47:53.900]  Thanks for the call,
[3:47:53.900 --> 3:47:55.780]  and I wasn't trying to bash you, Christopher,
[3:47:55.780 --> 3:47:57.940]  but do you wanna comment on what he was saying
[3:47:57.940 --> 3:47:58.820]  about Ron Paul?
[3:48:00.500 --> 3:48:02.100]  Well, I think people are disappointed,
[3:48:02.100 --> 3:48:04.980]  and they don't understand the things that you do,
[3:48:04.980 --> 3:48:07.540]  and the man is 73 years old,
[3:48:07.540 --> 3:48:09.460]  he's two months older than I am,
[3:48:09.460 --> 3:48:11.380]  and he's not as lucky as I am.
[3:48:11.380 --> 3:48:13.700]  I don't have anything wrong with me, he does,
[3:48:13.700 --> 3:48:16.020]  and he did the best he could,
[3:48:16.020 --> 3:48:18.300]  and he woke up a lot of people.
[3:48:18.300 --> 3:48:20.820]  He showed that there was a lot of people
[3:48:20.820 --> 3:48:22.700]  who weren't happy in America.
[3:48:22.700 --> 3:48:24.420]  He brought the message to young people,
[3:48:24.420 --> 3:48:26.420]  which is most important,
[3:48:26.420 --> 3:48:28.180]  and I think he did a great job,
[3:48:28.180 --> 3:48:30.380]  and he just couldn't take it all the way,
[3:48:30.380 --> 3:48:33.100]  with his wife sick and his campaign manager gone,
[3:48:33.100 --> 3:48:37.260]  and the sniping, even from the upper echelon
[3:48:37.260 --> 3:48:41.140]  of the supposed right wing of the Republican Party,
[3:48:41.140 --> 3:48:44.180]  and I'm not talking about the fascists in Washington,
[3:48:44.180 --> 3:48:47.580]  and it wasn't easy for him,
[3:48:47.580 --> 3:48:50.600]  and I think you gotta cut him a little slack.
[3:48:51.780 --> 3:48:54.140]  Just be happy he was there for us.
[3:48:54.140 --> 3:48:55.700]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:48:55.700 --> 3:48:56.980]  and put his life in danger,
[3:48:56.980 --> 3:49:01.180]  I mean, and folks, you can't take victory from yourself,
[3:49:01.180 --> 3:49:02.860]  and this was a big victory,
[3:49:02.860 --> 3:49:04.180]  and instead of us coming together
[3:49:04.180 --> 3:49:06.700]  and breaking campaign records and all that,
[3:49:06.700 --> 3:49:09.340]  you know, COINTELPRO goes out and plants seeds
[3:49:09.340 --> 3:49:10.580]  at where'd all the men go?
[3:49:10.580 --> 3:49:13.100]  Well, it's all accounted for, we know where it all went,
[3:49:13.100 --> 3:49:14.340]  and it was all spent,
[3:49:14.340 --> 3:49:15.900]  and you know, well, what's going on with this?
[3:49:15.900 --> 3:49:16.820]  What's going on with that?
[3:49:16.820 --> 3:49:19.540]  We just, you know, keep it downrange, folks.
[3:49:19.540 --> 3:49:21.980]  Ron Paul isn't the problem, okay?
[3:49:21.980 --> 3:49:23.220]  He's not the problem.
[3:49:24.100 --> 3:49:25.540]  You know, I mean, it's that simple.
[3:49:25.540 --> 3:49:27.540]  I asked him to run, so that meant,
[3:49:27.540 --> 3:49:28.940]  and I begged him to run privately,
[3:49:28.940 --> 3:49:29.780]  and he said I was one of the people
[3:49:29.780 --> 3:49:30.740]  that finally turned him to do it,
[3:49:30.740 --> 3:49:32.980]  telling him it would be big, and it was big,
[3:49:32.980 --> 3:49:34.500]  and you know, he opened doors for folks
[3:49:34.500 --> 3:49:36.820]  that are coming in the future.
[3:49:36.820 --> 3:49:39.980]  Bob Chapman, behind the scenes at infowars.com,
[3:49:39.980 --> 3:49:40.820]  was a route of time,
[3:49:40.820 --> 3:49:41.900]  I want to come back to the final segment here,
[3:49:41.900 --> 3:49:43.220]  and maybe cram in a few final calls,
[3:49:43.220 --> 3:49:45.660]  but with you, but in the three minutes
[3:49:45.660 --> 3:49:47.380]  we're about to have behind the scenes,
[3:49:47.380 --> 3:49:50.420]  folks got to go to the infowars.com stream
[3:49:50.420 --> 3:49:52.260]  to hear this right now.
[3:49:52.260 --> 3:49:55.460]  We know that 740-something financial institutions,
[3:49:55.460 --> 3:49:57.380]  the inner criminal syndicate,
[3:49:57.380 --> 3:49:59.740]  the brokerage firms, the banks, the hedge funds,
[3:49:59.740 --> 3:50:04.740]  they don't have, you know, shorts are banned against them,
[3:50:06.300 --> 3:50:07.940]  which can be very damaging to their companies
[3:50:07.940 --> 3:50:08.780]  when they're in trouble,
[3:50:08.780 --> 3:50:11.860]  but then they got all this money from a previous bailout
[3:50:11.860 --> 3:50:14.060]  to go attack the real economy,
[3:50:14.060 --> 3:50:15.780]  and they're looting that as well,
[3:50:15.780 --> 3:50:19.580]  so really, this is a takeover, not just a bailout,
[3:50:19.580 --> 3:50:21.580]  so I want to get your take on that right now,
[3:50:21.580 --> 3:50:22.740]  then we'll be back for everybody else
[3:50:22.740 --> 3:50:24.180]  in the final segment.
[3:50:24.180 --> 3:50:27.700]  Stay with us, we'll be right back at infowars.com.
[3:50:27.700 --> 3:50:30.060]  Keep up.
[3:50:30.060 --> 3:50:32.100]  Okay, Bob, can you break that down?
[3:50:32.980 --> 3:50:36.340]  Well, it's a consolidation of power, the way I see it,
[3:50:36.340 --> 3:50:39.020]  and some of the people who are involved,
[3:50:39.020 --> 3:50:41.180]  who will be left by the wayside,
[3:50:41.180 --> 3:50:46.180]  have been devoted to serving the evil master, if you may,
[3:50:47.020 --> 3:50:50.220]  the alumnus, but they don't care about that.
[3:50:50.220 --> 3:50:53.620]  They're trying to bring together a situation
[3:50:53.620 --> 3:50:56.700]  where there's perhaps five major brokerages
[3:50:56.700 --> 3:50:58.860]  in the country, and perhaps five major banks,
[3:50:58.860 --> 3:51:01.580]  and don't hang on the numbers, they're just guesses,
[3:51:01.580 --> 3:51:04.180]  and that consolidates their power,
[3:51:04.180 --> 3:51:06.740]  and they're gonna do the same thing in transportation,
[3:51:06.740 --> 3:51:09.860]  and manufacturing in different segments.
[3:51:09.860 --> 3:51:11.980]  They're gonna do it with utilities.
[3:51:11.980 --> 3:51:14.700]  It's all part of national socialism.
[3:51:14.700 --> 3:51:18.860]  Read Mussolini's playbook on it,
[3:51:18.860 --> 3:51:20.020]  and for those who don't know,
[3:51:20.020 --> 3:51:24.660]  Mussolini was a Marxist before he was a fascist,
[3:51:24.660 --> 3:51:29.460]  and it's the marriage of the state
[3:51:29.460 --> 3:51:32.260]  with corporations and industries,
[3:51:32.260 --> 3:51:34.940]  and the government will end up owning everything.
[3:51:34.940 --> 3:51:39.940]  So all of these financial bodies will call them,
[3:51:40.220 --> 3:51:43.340]  they get left by the wayside, they don't care about that,
[3:51:43.340 --> 3:51:46.940]  and they don't care about the shareholders, obviously.
[3:51:46.940 --> 3:51:49.180]  They care about the bondholders, the Fannie and Freddie,
[3:51:49.180 --> 3:51:50.180]  because they're gonna pay the mom
[3:51:50.180 --> 3:51:52.100]  because most of them are foreigners.
[3:51:52.100 --> 3:51:55.860]  I think it's 1.1 out of 1.4 trillion in bonds
[3:51:55.860 --> 3:51:59.180]  belong to foreigners in Fannie and Freddie Mac.
[3:51:59.180 --> 3:52:01.140]  Well, legally, to bail them out
[3:52:01.140 --> 3:52:04.020]  and not the shareholders is insanity.
[3:52:04.020 --> 3:52:05.620]  I mean, they can't get away with that,
[3:52:05.620 --> 3:52:07.260]  but they're doing anything they want
[3:52:07.260 --> 3:52:09.660]  because we already have a dictatorial government.
[3:52:10.900 --> 3:52:12.980]  Well, there's no doubt about that, Bob,
[3:52:12.980 --> 3:52:15.700]  and that's why this is contrived,
[3:52:15.700 --> 3:52:17.420]  it's admittedly contrived,
[3:52:17.420 --> 3:52:18.820]  but it's even scarier that you're saying
[3:52:18.820 --> 3:52:20.340]  that you think they've lost some control.
[3:52:20.340 --> 3:52:22.340]  I think it's also an opportunity for us,
[3:52:22.340 --> 3:52:27.340]  the old Chinese symbol of opportunity as a negative
[3:52:27.940 --> 3:52:30.260]  and a positive side to it.
[3:52:30.260 --> 3:52:32.380]  May you live in interesting times.
[3:52:32.380 --> 3:52:33.580]  We certainly live in those,
[3:52:33.580 --> 3:52:36.620]  and then these are times where people are listening now.
[3:52:36.620 --> 3:52:39.020]  They are paying attention to what we say,
[3:52:39.020 --> 3:52:40.900]  and so all of you out there,
[3:52:40.900 --> 3:52:43.020]  this is the time to show people documentary films
[3:52:43.020 --> 3:52:43.860]  about the New World Order.
[3:52:43.860 --> 3:52:46.300]  This is the time to call them to talk shows.
[3:52:46.300 --> 3:52:47.460]  This is the time to be heard,
[3:52:47.460 --> 3:52:49.380]  and I'm glad to hear on Local Talk Radio
[3:52:49.380 --> 3:52:51.460]  every other caller's talking about the New World Order
[3:52:51.460 --> 3:52:52.540]  on mainstream stations
[3:52:52.540 --> 3:52:54.140]  and about how the Federal Reserve's private
[3:52:54.140 --> 3:52:55.500]  and how they engineered it,
[3:52:55.500 --> 3:52:58.180]  and so they are losing their control,
[3:52:58.180 --> 3:53:00.900]  and this is gonna be a growing up process for people,
[3:53:00.900 --> 3:53:04.380]  and we may actually get some real liberty out of this
[3:53:04.380 --> 3:53:07.220]  at the end of the day, Bob.
[3:53:07.220 --> 3:53:09.940]  Well, we may get some real leaders, too.
[3:53:09.940 --> 3:53:12.540]  A younger man, men your age,
[3:53:12.540 --> 3:53:15.300]  that can evolve over the next 30 years
[3:53:15.300 --> 3:53:18.980]  and take our country back to where it should be
[3:53:18.980 --> 3:53:22.780]  that will force government to lay the blame on these people
[3:53:22.780 --> 3:53:24.980]  and punish them for what they've done,
[3:53:24.980 --> 3:53:26.820]  and you know, I'm not talking about
[3:53:26.820 --> 3:53:28.580]  taking them all out and hanging them.
[3:53:28.580 --> 3:53:31.100]  I'm talking about taking their wealth away from them,
[3:53:31.100 --> 3:53:33.900]  which essentially they stole from the American public.
[3:53:33.900 --> 3:53:35.540]  Bob, we're into the final segment.
[3:53:35.540 --> 3:53:37.740]  I wanted to get, here we go, folks.
[3:53:39.980 --> 3:53:42.500]  ["The International Forecaster"]
[3:53:42.500 --> 3:53:45.660]  All right, we're almost out of time.
[3:53:45.660 --> 3:53:47.620]  Theinternationalforecaster.com, go there,
[3:53:47.620 --> 3:53:49.500]  get a free copy.
[3:53:49.500 --> 3:53:50.900]  By signing up, he'll send you one,
[3:53:50.900 --> 3:53:52.860]  comes out twice a week, the hard copy,
[3:53:52.860 --> 3:53:54.380]  a couple times a month.
[3:53:54.380 --> 3:53:57.140]  Theinternationalforecaster.com, give you a number.
[3:53:57.140 --> 3:53:58.100]  Now, there's also a number, Bob.
[3:53:58.100 --> 3:53:59.220]  Do you have that on you for people to call
[3:53:59.220 --> 3:54:00.980]  and get a free copy?
[3:54:00.980 --> 3:54:03.140]  Well, yeah, I do, I do, I do, I do.
[3:54:03.140 --> 3:54:03.980]  Where is it?
[3:54:03.980 --> 3:54:06.020]  Well, while you're digging it out,
[3:54:06.020 --> 3:54:07.860]  Ted Anderson gave a gold offer today.
[3:54:07.860 --> 3:54:09.660]  I basically gold it below Spock's.
[3:54:09.660 --> 3:54:12.460]  He was able to buy it before it went up again.
[3:54:12.460 --> 3:54:16.420]  I mean, to me, it's a no-brainer for people
[3:54:16.420 --> 3:54:18.540]  to call our sponsor Minus Resources
[3:54:18.540 --> 3:54:21.940]  and get high-quality gold at very good prices and silver.
[3:54:21.940 --> 3:54:24.180]  I mean, Ted's even having trouble getting it.
[3:54:24.180 --> 3:54:25.260]  There is a shortage.
[3:54:25.260 --> 3:54:26.940]  While they try to suppress the price,
[3:54:26.940 --> 3:54:29.100]  how long can they suppress it?
[3:54:29.100 --> 3:54:31.220]  I mean, it's already gone up $100, but...
[3:54:31.220 --> 3:54:32.820]  It's hard to say.
[3:54:32.820 --> 3:54:35.260]  I don't think it's gonna be too much longer.
[3:54:35.260 --> 3:54:36.660]  And that phone number you're looking for,
[3:54:36.660 --> 3:54:40.060]  to call in for a free introductory copy
[3:54:40.060 --> 3:54:42.020]  of the International Forecaster,
[3:54:42.020 --> 3:54:47.020]  is 877-479-8178, and that's toll-free,
[3:54:48.340 --> 3:54:53.140]  877-479-8178.
[3:54:53.140 --> 3:54:56.820]  Or you can go to theinternationalforecaster.com,
[3:54:56.820 --> 3:55:00.860]  theinternationalforecaster.com on the internet.
[3:55:00.860 --> 3:55:04.060]  Bob, in closing, when do you think gold's gonna go?
[3:55:04.060 --> 3:55:06.140]  I mean, it's gone up over $100 in the last week and a half,
[3:55:06.140 --> 3:55:08.060]  and they're doing everything they can to suppress it,
[3:55:08.060 --> 3:55:10.260]  but it's like holding a beach ball under water.
[3:55:10.260 --> 3:55:12.860]  When will it go up, you know, past 1,000,
[3:55:12.860 --> 3:55:15.260]  and then how high do you think it'll go in the next year?
[3:55:15.260 --> 3:55:17.620]  Well, we certainly have a shot at over 1,000.
[3:55:17.620 --> 3:55:20.380]  The next year, we gotta be looking somewhere
[3:55:20.380 --> 3:55:23.340]  between 2,203,000.
[3:55:23.340 --> 3:55:27.340]  And, you know, once they stop suppressing,
[3:55:27.340 --> 3:55:29.100]  because they don't have any more gold,
[3:55:30.300 --> 3:55:32.380]  like you say, it's gonna be the beach ball theory
[3:55:32.380 --> 3:55:33.580]  under the water.
[3:55:33.580 --> 3:55:35.220]  And there's no telling what'll happen,
[3:55:35.220 --> 3:55:37.980]  and you've got to, you must be in
[3:55:37.980 --> 3:55:40.220]  gold and silver-related assets.
[3:55:40.220 --> 3:55:42.340]  If you have any money at all, of course,
[3:55:42.340 --> 3:55:43.980]  you should have paid all your bills off
[3:55:43.980 --> 3:55:46.700]  and your credit cards and are prepared with food
[3:55:46.700 --> 3:55:50.780]  and weapons and filters and things like that.
[3:55:50.780 --> 3:55:52.220]  There's a lot of things for you to do.
[3:55:52.220 --> 3:55:55.820]  There's a lot of responsibility for you and for your family,
[3:55:55.820 --> 3:55:57.020]  and you gotta do it now.
[3:55:57.020 --> 3:55:59.220]  But there may come a time when the dollars are worthless
[3:55:59.220 --> 3:56:00.820]  in the bank sooner rather than later,
[3:56:00.820 --> 3:56:02.820]  and people will wish they transferred some of them
[3:56:02.820 --> 3:56:04.940]  into gold and silver before it was devalued.
[3:56:04.940 --> 3:56:05.940]  Bob, we'll talk to you soon.
[3:56:05.940 --> 3:56:07.260]  Thanks for coming on.
[3:56:07.260 --> 3:56:08.180]  Okay, bye-bye.
[3:56:08.180 --> 3:56:09.900]  Take care, amazing interview there.
[3:56:09.900 --> 3:56:12.100]  I'm sorry, the other callers, I'll get to you tomorrow.
[3:56:12.100 --> 3:56:13.260]  In fact, if you call in tomorrow
[3:56:13.260 --> 3:56:14.860]  and you say that you didn't get on today,
[3:56:14.860 --> 3:56:16.940]  from the line tomorrow, other big guests tomorrow,
[3:56:16.940 --> 3:56:17.860]  important information.
[3:56:17.860 --> 3:56:20.180]  I wanted to bring Ted up in the last minute and a half.
[3:56:20.180 --> 3:56:22.940]  Ted, I was just thinking, that's why I drug you in here.
[3:56:22.940 --> 3:56:25.060]  I was thinking, man, it's crazy.
[3:56:25.060 --> 3:56:26.940]  I mean, I totally believe in gold and silver.
[3:56:26.940 --> 3:56:29.540]  It's great prices, it's an introductory thing
[3:56:29.540 --> 3:56:30.580]  to get folks into the market.
[3:56:30.580 --> 3:56:33.900]  People don't need to wait until this thing even goes up more.
[3:56:33.900 --> 3:56:34.780]  In fact, I'm gonna call you today
[3:56:34.780 --> 3:56:37.980]  and get some of that silver to try to position myself
[3:56:37.980 --> 3:56:38.820]  even better.
[3:56:38.820 --> 3:56:40.740]  Tell folks about the offer, you got one minute.
[3:56:40.740 --> 3:56:41.700]  Yeah, sure, of course.
[3:56:41.700 --> 3:56:43.780]  We got the British sovereigns, they're at 241.
[3:56:43.780 --> 3:56:46.060]  We got the Franks, they're at 196.
[3:56:46.060 --> 3:56:49.660]  And we have the silver, and they're at $1.60 a dime.
[3:56:49.660 --> 3:56:52.260]  I gotta tell you, it's pandemonium right now, Alex.
[3:56:52.260 --> 3:56:54.420]  There's just so many things that are going on.
[3:56:54.420 --> 3:56:56.580]  I can't express it enough.
[3:56:56.580 --> 3:57:00.420]  People need, not if you should get in,
[3:57:00.420 --> 3:57:02.660]  and not when there might be a crash.
[3:57:02.660 --> 3:57:03.900]  We're having the crash.
[3:57:03.900 --> 3:57:05.700]  It's all coming right now.
[3:57:05.700 --> 3:57:06.820]  And we've told you what's happening.
[3:57:06.820 --> 3:57:07.980]  We told you what's going on.
[3:57:07.980 --> 3:57:10.380]  The paper is going down the tubes.
[3:57:10.380 --> 3:57:12.860]  The globalists are engineering this,
[3:57:12.860 --> 3:57:15.260]  and you know, it goes up, it goes down,
[3:57:15.260 --> 3:57:16.860]  but they're telling you depression,
[3:57:16.860 --> 3:57:18.060]  they're looting everything.
[3:57:18.060 --> 3:57:23.060]  Give Ted Anderson's brokers a call, 800-686-2237-1800.
[3:57:25.060 --> 3:57:29.220]  686-2237, folks will be there until midnight
[3:57:29.220 --> 3:57:32.140]  on that smoking deal on gold and silver.
[3:57:32.140 --> 3:57:34.260]  I hope you'll protect yourselves, get some firearms,
[3:57:34.260 --> 3:57:36.500]  food as well, but mainly wake your neighbors,
[3:57:36.500 --> 3:57:38.420]  your friends, your family up, know who to blame,
[3:57:38.420 --> 3:57:40.380]  discredit the criminal government.
[3:57:40.380 --> 3:57:45.380]  Again, that number, 1-800-686-2237.
[3:57:48.220 --> 3:57:49.580]  That's basically it for this transmission.
[3:57:49.580 --> 3:57:50.420]  Thank you, Ted.
[3:57:50.420 --> 3:57:51.460]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:57:51.460 --> 3:57:55.660]  Now, I had Ron Paul on in the second hour.
[3:57:55.660 --> 3:57:58.020]  I had Webster Tarpleon right near the front of the show,
[3:57:58.020 --> 3:58:00.580]  amazing analysis, and I had Bob Chapman on.
[3:58:00.580 --> 3:58:03.140]  Please tune in now for the retransmission
[3:58:03.140 --> 3:58:05.260]  at infowars.com only.
[3:58:05.260 --> 3:58:07.020]  Thanks to all the affiliate sponsors, everybody.
[3:58:07.020 --> 3:58:07.940]  God bless you all.
[3:58:07.940 --> 3:58:31.540]  We'll be right back at infowars.com.
