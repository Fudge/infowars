[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.520]  He stands for truth. He stands for justice. He stands for what's right. This is the Alex
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:35.640]  Jones Show. Call Alex now toll free at 877-590-5525. Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.400]  Now into the second hour. I'm here every Sunday evening or afternoon, depending on which time
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.680]  zone you're listening to this in, here in the North American Union. The toll free number
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.400]  to join us is 877-590-5525. We're locally in Central Texas. Well, I guess this is a
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.960]  village in Oklahoma and down in the Mexico in some areas. That's 836-0590. But we're
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.360]  going to get your calls, those of you that are holding from New York and Wisconsin and
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.840]  North Dakota. But that will be in the last 30 minutes of the show, interspersed with
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.040]  the key news I mentioned in the first hour. Orlando Sentinel neo-Nazi rally was organized
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.080]  by the FBI through an informant. Oh yes, why is the government staging Nazi rallies all
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.520]  over the country as to terrorize the public? And we'll break that down for you. Also, some
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.760]  new medical developments, some really scary stuff, and some good news as well. And I will
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.320]  spend some time getting into credit cards aimed at illegal immigrants. No ID needed
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.720]  to get them. And it just so happens I have an employee who has a Bank of America bank
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.080]  account. And they won't even let him do basic banking without two forms of ID. So you can
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.560]  have bank accounts with them. It doesn't matter. But if you're an illegal alien, man, you're
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.720]  like God. That's all part of the North American Union as well. We'll break that down. Now,
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.880]  I've been attacked by popular mechanics, good old yellow journalism, Hearst Publishing.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.920]  And I've been attacked by the Washington Post and Vanity Fair and literally hundreds of
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.400]  magazines and newspapers and dozens of national and international TV shows. And I get a little
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.340]  bit used to it. But the BBC came here, I don't know, back in August and for a week followed
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.000]  me around at my office, my home, my car, here at the studios here in North Austin where
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.240]  I do the Sunday radio show. I just started the show. We're developing it for syndication
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.780]  then for a few months before it kicked off four months ago. And rarely at the end of
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.980]  an interview, especially when I've spent off and on a week with people, would they just
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.260]  tell me that they don't believe a word I've said and laugh at me. But Guy Smith, the director
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.900]  of the program, a big mainline BBC production that aired tonight, it ended about an hour
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.060]  and eight minutes ago. I haven't had a chance to see it yet, but we saw the synopsis and
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.420]  four or five articles the BBC put out promoing it and several clips. And it was clear it
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.740]  was a hit piece. They admitted it was a hit piece, basically, while at the same time denying
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.340]  it. Like, oh yeah, they're a bunch of crazy cooks, but at the same time this is a balanced
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.300]  piece. Well, Paul Watson, who's a reporter for PrisonPlanet.com and the editor over there
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.760]  as well, joins us from the UK. And he had a chance to see it tonight and to write up
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.020]  some notes. And so this is delving into how they run these hit pieces, how they operate,
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.020]  their basic MO. So for this segment and part of the next, Paul will give us a rundown
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.620]  of 9-11 Conspiracies, part of the new BBC four-part series, quote, Conspiracies. And
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.980]  Paul Watson joins us now. Paul, thank you for coming on on Sunday evening.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.940]  Good to be here, Alex.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.980]  Paul, you had a chance to see it there with your girlfriend this evening. Tell me what
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.660]  the notes you have. I know a big article is coming out tomorrow on PrisonPlanet.com. You're
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.380]  going to analyze it. You wrote several articles previously this week, one that got picked
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.420]  up on the main page of Dig.com, hundreds of times bigger than the Drudge Report. And so
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.540]  we've got millions of readers just off of that report. What are you going to be writing
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.700]  about tomorrow?
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.700]  Well, I predicted in those articles at the end of the week, Alex, that this would be
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:20.060]  a highly sophisticated hit piece. Well, you can subtract the words highly sophisticated
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.140]  and then you'll have an accurate reflection of what it was. It was a hit piece, but it
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.020]  was blatantly obvious that it was designed to be that all along.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.740]  For the lowest common denominator.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.420]  Exactly. And you said that the BBC followed you around for a week, basically.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.140]  And at the end of it, just started laughing at me. And I literally felt like I was sitting
[00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.220]  there with operatives or something at the restaurant. We ate at P.F. Chang's after the
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.220]  Sunday show and they were just all laughing at me. They were like, oh, the government
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.100]  didn't kill Diana. And I go, well, 80-something percent of Brits believe it. And she said
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.700]  Charles told her he was going to kill her in a fake auto accident. And Dr. David Kelly
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.700]  said that the government was going to kill him. They laughed at me about that. They wouldn't
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.780]  let me put Operation Northwoods in there. None of the actual U.S. government plans to
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.980]  carry out 9-11 style attacks. They all wanted to just discuss straw men.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.380]  But Paul, you're here. You've seen it. Tell us about it.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:21.020]  All right. Just on the sheer numbers alone, they had three individuals representing the
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:32.020]  9-11 truth movement being Alex Jones, yourself, Jim Fetzer, and Dylan Avery. They had 11 individuals
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.940]  either representing the official story or the incompetence whitewash. So just by the
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.940]  very numbers, they had more than three times the amount of debunkers versus so-called 9-11
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.740]  truthers. And the method they used was...
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.540]  Well, that would... You said 14 to 3. That would be five...
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.940]  Eleven. Eleven to three.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.500]  Oh, eleven. Okay. Okay. So that would be almost four times.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.500]  Almost four times. The tactic they used was they would let the debunkers talk at length
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.740]  about their issues and the 9-11 truthers were highly edited. I mean, you alone to say that
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.660]  they spent a week with you, the total amount of time that you were on the show, I guess,
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.700]  would equate to about three minutes. And you had little segments alone, you know...
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.700]  They also promised to mention PrisonPlanet.com. I mean, I gave them free films, had stuff
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.060]  dubbed at great expense, spent just four or five hours a day, sometimes eight, nine hours
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.700]  a day, catering to these people, and you say I'm in the film three minutes.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.700]  Yeah, it's short segments of you. There's no mention of PrisonPlanet.com. In fact, on
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.900]  the BBC's own website, for the promo material, they linked to Infowars. They got the wrong
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.220]  link, so it was a dead link and they failed to correct it.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.380]  Yeah, I'm sure that was an accident.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.140]  But they say every great work of fiction has to have a strong beginning, middle, and end,
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.100]  and that's exactly what the BBC produced in this work of fiction. Because at the start
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.100]  of the program, the debate was framed so as to make it appear that 9-11 truth, and even
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.620]  asking any questions about it, was an insult to the victims.
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.500]  And they keep saying that we're emotional, and that it's a religion, and that we're not
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:24.500]  going off facts. The head, and you need to put this in the article, and I'm interviewing,
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:32.020]  the head of the biggest 9-11 families group now believes it's an inside job, and so the
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.740]  majority of the victims' families believe it's a total inside job. Be sure and add that.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.300]  They have had huge demonstrations at the White House. The majority of the firefighters we
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:47.820]  talked to in New York, we have them on video, believe it's an inside job. We have 84 percent
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.060]  of Americans in major polls believing they're being lied to about 9-11, but I did predict
[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.940]  they would claim that we were insulting and making the families mad, and of course they
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.340]  had some guy from the X-Files on there explaining how it's a religion we have, that we're a
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.300]  bunch of kooks, but go ahead, Paul.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.300]  Right. I mean, the very start of the show was a narrative of the official version of
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:16.300]  events, and as I predicted, it was this sneering, sardonic female narrative narrator, and then
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:23.380]  they showed images of the event while narrating the official story, along with the grief-stricken
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.420]  faces of the victims, therefore marrying the two, the official version of events and the
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:33.340]  poor, helpless victims in the mind of the casual viewer, and as you mentioned, failed
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.700]  to include the fact that the majority of family groups are now the ones asking the questions,
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:45.140]  and that it was a government cover-up in the very hours after 9-11 that has now resulted
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:51.420]  in 20% of the heroes, the first responders, dying as a result of that cover-up, which
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.460]  told them that the...
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.700]  And now it's admitted they have the EPA documents where they say they were ordered to cover
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.220]  it up and not give them medical treatment.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.980]  Right. And that's 20% of the first responders that are now dying.
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:08.260]  And by the way, all of the police dogs are now dead from nasal and lung cancer.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.180]  Right. And we know for a fact that they talked to first responders who were there at the
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.020]  scene, like Craig Bartman.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:22.420]  That's right. Who I've interviewed for video. Well, let's talk about that. Exactly. Oh,
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:29.420]  man. I mean, folks, there's so many... We're analyzing a hit piece. We're analyzing propaganda
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:36.420]  here. And so basically, it was an emotional piece that just went after emotion, Paul.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.100]  We'll find out on the other side from Paul Watson of PrisonPlanet.com. Find out the truth,
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.060]  folks. See TerrorStorm for yourself. We'll be right back on the other side of this quick
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.060]  break. Stay with us.

[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.580]  your e-mails and your chats, you're going back and forth with friends, even if it has

[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:38.860]  read back to you while you sit on the stand in court in front of a jury. This is unbelievable.

[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:28.260]  I'm sick of people talking about how the video games affect the kids. Video games for a lot
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.900]  of guys are entertainment. I don't call it entertainment. They show these to adults that
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.140]  are in the military so that they'll have no compunction about pulling the switch. Making
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.100]  the comment about training the guys to pull the trigger easier is completely inaccurate.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.500]  It affects the kids, it affects the adults, and people are just lying to themselves. Get
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:53.500]  your morning fix with Mark, Ed, and Sergeant Sam, weekday mornings from 5.30 to 10 on KLBJ.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:12:00.980]  How quickly we forget. Price of gasoline drops, the sale of hybrid cars collapses. It's amazing.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.720]  Hybrid cars have dropped, the sales of them, according to Edmunds.com, have dropped by
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:15.720]  a third since gas prices fell from their peak of over $3 a gallon. So we have short memories,
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:23.560]  and people who wanted hybrid cars during the run-up in gasoline found the prices of them
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:30.560]  being sold way, way, way above list. Now that's over, but now I'm looking at supply figures
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.780]  from the industry, and you've got a good shot moving forward that you're going to be able
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.440]  to deal on a hybrid. That's right. Instead of the dealer telling you what you're going
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.080]  to pay, you're going to be able to negotiate for a hybrid like any other vehicle. But even
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.280]  with that having been said, got to run the numbers comparing the hybrid to a regular
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.360]  gas engine car to see if you'll ever make up that extra cost that you pay up front.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:59.360]  I have fantastic news for you on the car front. This is Clark Howard with fantastic money
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:06.260]  saving deals on Chrysler products. Chrysler is having so much trouble unloading cars that
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:11.280]  are sitting on dealer lots and in parking lots owned by Chrysler that they're offering
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.160]  double incentives right now according to the Detroit News. Dealers right now are getting
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:23.160]  under the table money from Chrysler known as dealer incentives of up to $7,000 per model.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.920]  That's about the most extreme I've ever heard. And consumers are receiving targeted mailings
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:37.920]  for coupons for up to $1,000. Actually, they are worth $1,000 if you buy a Chrysler product.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:45.920]  These coupons will pretty soon show up on trading sites like Craigslist and eBay. So
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.880]  if you want a coupon and you didn't get one, you should be able to find one pretty easily.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.200]  And they need you so you can deal even beyond the vouchers.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.440]  Hi, it's Dr. Dean Adell. All right, you've got a kid in high school. If I were to ask
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.440]  you what you think your child has done sexually versus what your kid would say they really
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.440]  have done, do you think it would be the same?
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.440]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:18.440]  All right, welcome back. Your calls and a ton of really important news on other subjects
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:27.600]  coming up after the break, but about eight, nine months ago they had the Scripps Howard
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:34.560]  Ohio poll. Thirty-six percent believe 9-11 is a total inside job. Sixty-six percent in
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.720]  that poll believe they're being lied to. And a few months after that, now just about five
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.960]  months ago, Angus and Reid poll for the Wall Street Journal and ABC News found 84 percent
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.360]  believe they're being lied to about 9-11. You have documentary films on 9-11, being
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.640]  an inside job, being routinely number one and almost always in the top 100 of Google
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.080]  Video like my film Terror Storm that you can, again, watch for free. And then you've
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:04.400]  got the BBC constantly interrogating me, trying to get me to screw up, trying to get me to
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.560]  talk about straw men or issues of 9-11 that weren't true, because there are a lot of kooks
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.120]  out there putting out this info. And so I guess for a week, because they didn't plan
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.520]  to be here but for a day or two, but they just kept coming back and doing more and getting
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.040]  more and more frustrated and then pretty much on purpose saying, oh, we just need thirty
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.920]  more minutes. My wife's waiting for me to eat dinner. They take almost two hours. And
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.960]  I guess they didn't get what they wanted, Paul, because you say, I wasn't in there very
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.560]  much. Let me guess, Fetzer was in there a whole bunch.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:37.560]  That's correct. Fetzer especially got prominence, but the tactic they used was they played the
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.920]  statements of the debunkers at length and gave them a chance to talk, whereas your statements
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:51.920]  and Avery's statements were highly, tightly edited and brief. I mean, they had one shot,
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.040]  which was just of the interviewer asking Dylan Avery a question, and it shows Avery shifting
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:05.160]  his eyes, blatant attempt to discredit him. And this was not repeated.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.720]  They spent days with them, too. Exactly. Imagine me for a week having to keep my eyes straight,
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:13.840]  never picking my nose, never wiping my face, always when they have the camera not having
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.720]  to be totally on. Did they catch me in anything stupid because they were sneaking around the
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:25.240]  entire time? Did they catch me acting buffoonish? No, but what they did was they would refer
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:32.240]  to the debunkers as either heroes or sober professionals, but they referred to Dylan
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:39.960]  Avery as a self-confessed dropout, and they referred to you as an internet evangelist.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.640]  So they threw in those negative connotations immediately in the description of who they
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:52.640]  were interviewing. But another tactic they used, as I mentioned, they would let the debunkers
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:59.900]  talk at length, and then the sneering female narrator would lend them credibility by announcing
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.460]  the supporting evidence and referring to documents, and so...
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.280]  Let me guess. They used NIST to support why the towers fell, Building 7 not hit by a jet
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.120]  aircraft, did they mention? And at the time, I gave them the documents on this that NIST
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.360]  has removed the five reasons they claim the towers collapsed and are saying they're now
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.040]  having to look at explosives.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.000]  They did not mention that they were looking at explosives. All they said was it's subject
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.200]  to an upcoming report, which is most likely going to back up the official version of events
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.920]  which they first...
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.680]  But almost six years on, right now they're saying, okay, buildings have never fallen
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.640]  like this, there may be bombs. But I guess when I gave them that NIST report, they didn't
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.440]  care.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:47.440]  No. And the focus on Building 7 was so pathetic, it barely amounted to a minute. They focused
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:54.920]  their core attack around three issues, which were that a C-130 plane coordinated the attack
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:02.300]  on the Pentagon, the supposition that there was no plane in Pennsylvania, and the Jewish
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.640]  conspiracy angle. So it was...
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.720]  Now let's be clear, neither I, Avery, or Fetzer think it's an Israeli attack. In fact, they've
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.320]  had national polls of people that believe it's an inside job. Seven percent believe
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:21.040]  Israel was involved. They kept trying to get me to talk about that. I should know the military
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.720]  industrial complex, criminal elements of it. I laid all that out, and I saw from the promo
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.880]  and I predicted they would have someone who was Jewish who lost a family member saying
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.760]  he died, so why wasn't he warned not to go to work? And let me guess, is that what they
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.280]  had in the film?
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:45.280]  Yeah, that was one of the three centerpieces of it. They showed this Jewish victim photographs
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:52.160]  of his family, his baby. They regaled us with tales of how he saved other people in the
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.080]  building, thinking...
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.320]  Did they imply that I said that they weren't in the building?
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.720]  No, not to you personally. That was mainly...
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.200]  It was all guilt by association. That's how they operate. Well, that whole story started
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.580]  because Harach, Jerusalem Post, and Newsweek reported the fact that Otago Instant Message
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:13.240]  Company based in Tel Aviv warned their New York offices two hours before to get their
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.240]  employees out of the building, and the director of Otago is on record. But a lot of people
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:23.280]  got warnings. In fact, other companies got warnings. That's why at that time of day,
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.800]  that building was only at half the occupancy it normally was.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.000]  Right, but they said that Hezbollah was the source of that, so they then linked us in
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.560]  with Hezbollah and terrorists. What they did with the collapses, they actually showed the
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.200]  Nova animation, which shows the so-called pancake collapse.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.280]  Which says there were no central columns in Tower 1 or 2.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.680]  Right, and the animation shows the floors collapsing at a rate of about two or three
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:56.680]  a second, when we know that each tower collapsed in just over 10 seconds, meaning that 11 floors
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.960]  a second would have needed to collapse without resistance, and that was never mentioned.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:08.000]  Now let's be clear, they fell at free fall speed, impossible. By the way, underwriting
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.360]  laboratories who underwrote the buildings in a study and concluded it was impossible.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.240]  And then when the director of one of their projects went public, Kevin Ryan, they fired
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.680]  him. Okay? Whenever you see UL on a building, or UL on a fire extinguisher or a life vest,
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.280]  they certify everything in the Western world, folks. They said it's impossible, and then
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.480]  we're told for national security reasons not to report it.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:34.280]  Yeah, they were showing this Nova animation, which has been debunked time and time again
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.720]  because it shows two floors collapsing every second, which would have meant that the entirety
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:46.720]  of the building would have taken 50, 60 seconds to collapse, which is obviously not the case.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.120]  One collapsed in 10, one in, what about 11?
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:57.120]  Right. Another tactic they used was they lent the debunkers more credibility by telling
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.000]  the public that they were there. Well, they were there. They must have known what would
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.720]  have happened.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.440]  Let's go back to what you just said earlier. I've interviewed a bunch of police officers.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.020]  Next week we're going to literally have like 15 guests on concerning this. We're lining
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.440]  them all up because I've had them all on, but I want to have them on separate. I mean,
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.480]  we've had them on separate. I want them on together. Firefighters, police, emergency
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.000]  workers, EMTs saying they were told, get back from 7, the government's going to blow it
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.800]  up for everyone's safety. Get back. People saying they saw bombs go off. Firemen saying
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:35.160]  it was like molten steel, like lava, which jet fuel can't do. On and on and on. Again,
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.200]  the majority, I want to ask you during the break, my memory's failing me today. I interviewed
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.280]  you about a year ago. Who's the head of the 7,000 plus victims group? Doyle, Bill Doyle,
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.840]  who lost his son, Joey Doyle, came on my show. This is the guy you've seen all over the news,
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.040]  folks. The head of the biggest group and said, yes, the government did it. I didn't believe
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.760]  it. I looked into it. They did it. And I said, how many of your group believe it? He said,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.160]  more than half believe the government did it and the rest are starting to think it.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.680]  So I want that in an article too. I want the mother of all articles. I want to discredit
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:13.480]  every second they said with video, documents, NIST reports. I'm just going to crush you.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.800]  New World Order, we're coming at you. I just love the fact you lied and twisted. We've
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:24.800]  got you now. Paul, I got loaded phone lines, but I want to do just about four minutes with
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.000]  you on the other side because I want you to be able to get into any other facets. You
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.840]  guys got me laughing in there. I got cameras in here. The guys in the control room are
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:39.040]  laughing at me. It makes me laugh. This is not a laughing matter. Paul, stay there. Let's
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.680]  do about three or four minutes on the other side. All right. I'm Alex Jones. Paul Watson
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.000]  is our guest joining us from England. And I just love it. The New World Order just gets
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.760]  themselves deeper and deeper into trouble every time with their propaganda. We will
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.760]  now debunk them. Debunking the debunkers. Stay with us.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:04.760]  Hey, Bill. I'm buying lunch today. And check this out. I bought a new car.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.840]  Wow, John. I guess you took my advice and visited that website we were talking about
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.640]  over lunch last time we met, www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:21.040]  I did, and you were right. I learned how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week,
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.880]  starting with my very first week. And it's a simple program that does all the work for
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.960]  you. I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my fifth week.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.680]  Whoa, that's awesome. John, your business will keep growing as mine has. In fact, people
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:40.600]  are joining from all over the world. It's incredible. Everyone should go to www.didyourobbillgates.com
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.240]  and learn how this program can help them become financially independent too.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.760]  Thanks a million, Bill, for telling me about www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.120]  Check, please. I got this one, Bill.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:59.120]  Mr. John, let's tell everyone about www.didyourobbillgates.com. Deal.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.440]  News Radio 590 KLBJ. I'm Jeff Chapman. Good afternoon. It's 530. Topping Austin's news,
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.920]  state minority leader Mitch McConnell criticizes Democrats on CNN's late edition Sunday for
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.480]  their opposition to President Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.080]  They confirmed General Petraeus 81 to nothing to go out and try to succeed in this mission.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.920]  We ought to give him some support and give him a chance to succeed.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.640]  Two Senate committee chairmen have raised the possibility of modifying the resolution
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.800]  that authorized the president to go to war in Iraq. Democrat Carl Levin tells Fox News
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.560]  Sunday that adjusting the measure would provide a much more limited mission in Iraq. The overall
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:43.040]  winner in Austin of the women's division in the AT&T Austin Marathon was Zanabaye Mogues
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.080]  of Ethiopia. Her translator says the race was very difficult for her.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:56.560]  The men's winner was 20-year-old Kenyan Jenasee Baswati, Derek Williamson of Austin came in
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.680]  first in the half marathon. I'm Jeff Chapman live local news every half hour and breaking
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.480]  news right away from Austin's 24-hour news station, News Radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:11.480]  Women would prefer to get cash than receive a gift card from you. Four to one. Women?
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.480]  Alright now this is the shocker because I've been convinced that women prefer gift cards
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:24.480]  over cash. But a majority of women, about 60% to 40%, prefer cash over getting a gift
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.880]  card. Here's the challenge for you guys. How do you know whether the woman you're buying
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.360]  something for would prefer cash or a gift card? You don't want to offend them so that's
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:43.520]  the tough thing. But gift cards offend me because they're such a bad deal. If you want
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.160]  to give somebody something but you don't know what to give them, cash is much better than
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.160]  a gift card that comes with all kinds of strings attached.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.440]  Dad, can I ask you something? Sure. There's this girl I kind of like. Say no more. You
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.240]  just have to impress her. Okay, but how? Just pick up a lot of heavy things around her.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.440]  Like what? You know, desk, chairs, people. Grunt if you have to. Grunt? Yeah, be like
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:10.440]  grunt. There you go. You don't have to be perfect to be a perfect parent. When you adopt
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:14.040]  a child from foster care, just being there makes all the difference. To learn more, call

[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.720]  of Health and Human Services, and the Ad Council.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.760]  Rush Limbaugh. The drive-by media is invested in our defeat so that they can demonstrate
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.440]  to themselves their power to influence worldwide and national events. There is no question
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.320]  that there's a shadow government somewhere, and it's got the cooperation of the drive-by
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:49.040]  media. Defeating the United States in the war in Iraq, the war on terror, is clearly
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:56.040]  at the top of the agenda. Rush is live, weekdays from 11 to 2, on News Radio 590, KLPJ.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:08.040]  Listen carefully. Do you know what that is? That's the sound of someone being there. The
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:15.040]  sound of someone caring about a kid. Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:22.040]  the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:29.040]  Alright, Paul Watson. You talked about one of the police officers I interviewed at the
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:35.560]  memorials. An admitted hero. He's been in the newspaper as a hero. Talking about the
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.800]  bombs going off, everybody being told to get back from the buildings. He's now got serious
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.080]  medical problems. Sometimes you're with these guys and they've got to take respirators around
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.920]  with them. I mean, they're like Darth Vader or something. It's so sad. And they interviewed
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.020]  him. Tell folks about that story. Then let's talk about how Fox News has taken over part
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.500]  of the BBC and the insiders we had at BBC that reported to us, and now that's being
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.860]  proven pretty darn accurate, that this was a designed hit piece. Let's walk through that.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:07.860]  Right. Well, you make reference to Craig Bartmer, who was a former NYPD official who was in
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:16.140]  the service on the day of 9-11. He went down there to help out his buddies. Got the call
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:22.740]  through the radio that Building 7 was about to be brought down. He was running away from
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.780]  it when it was collapsing. And by the way, we don't just have him. We have CNN with two
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.500]  cops going, get back. They're going to blow the building up. They're bringing 7 down.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.660]  And then we have all the other firefighters, EMTs we've interviewed saying, yeah, they
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.980]  were going to blow it up. There's dozens. He heard the bombs tearing down the building
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:44.980]  as he ran away from it. But in this documentary, the only quote of a fireman or first responder
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:51.580]  that they use is somebody who says that the sprinkler systems in Building 7 have been
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:58.380]  damaged. Therefore, that then led them to make the case that Building 7 was imploded
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.020]  because the fires were out of control, and that's what caused it.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.600]  But how do you plant bombs, and the government says they didn't blow it up. Now they're trying
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.940]  to admit they did blow it up. But let's be clear. They interviewed him. Did they even
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.100]  use him in the film?
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:16.260]  No, they didn't use any first responder or fireman. They didn't even quote the official
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:21.860]  tapes from within the towers that reported bombs going off. Yet they used this one offhand
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.300]  quote.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.420]  Yeah, they got fire captains in there going, we've knocked the fires down almost nothing.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.620]  Wait, there's explosions. We've got explosives. We've got bombs. I mean, what more do you
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.420]  need? We've played all these.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:37.140]  No mention of the bombs in the basement either. No mention of the molten pools under the towers
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:43.420]  months, weeks after. They didn't use any quotes from firemen on the day, but they used this
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.060]  one to back up the narrative.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.540]  Well, we've got to do, if it takes a five-parter, we've got to do it. We've got to decipher
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:55.780]  and break down everything. I mean, don't they know that this just digs a deeper hole for
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.860]  them when they do these type of shoddy jobs?
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:04.860]  Well, it became so obvious that at the end, the sardonic sneering female narrator, just
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:11.020]  to mirror what these producers did in your company before they'd even finished filming
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:18.020]  this production, she was giggling at the end of the program, saying that the conspiracy
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:22.860]  theories are nothing more than theories. And when she said the word theory, she was actually
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.420]  giggling. So that's your balanced BBC, the narrator.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:32.300]  Now, let's be clear. We've got a former Fox exec, I mean, Viet Dinh's on the Fox board
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.900]  of directors, the guy that wrote the Patriot Act. He involved in this, and we had internal
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:41.540]  BBC reports saying this was going to be the mother, that previously it wasn't big enough
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.640]  of a hit piece, so they went in and re-edited. I talked to Guy Smith on Friday, the director.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.740]  He denied that, but said he couldn't come on Friday because they were still editing.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:56.820]  Right. It was always going to be a hit piece, but the pressure from harming BBC's corporate
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.700]  interests in America obviously made them go all the way.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.900]  Now, Smith also, you found out, is involved with the Ford Foundation?
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:10.900]  Oh, yeah. Mr. Guy Smith is a consultant for the Innovation Corporation, which is a media
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:22.620]  consultancy agency. It's run by an individual that is in the Ford Foundation, so that gives
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:29.380]  you an... It's basically the BBC, what they were trying to achieve in this production.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.380]  It's government television, by the way.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:36.740]  Yes. That's what we pay our license for. It's a tax. We get taxed for this government propaganda
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:43.380]  in this country. They're repeaters, and they want to repeat the establishment line because
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.140]  they're part of the establishment, and they weave all these psychological webs about how
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:53.140]  we need 9-11. We need to think it's something more than 19 Arabs for us to do it.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.780]  Oh, that's right. It's too scary to think 19 Arabs did it. It's not scary to think we
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:02.980]  have a criminal government that did it. It's a mentally ill religion that we have, which
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.620]  they put on their website before they even aired it. Hey, we're just going off the facts.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.820]  I kept saying, won't you talk about Northwoods, the declassified U.S. government plan to hijack
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:15.300]  jets, bomb DC, blame it on foreign enemies? Won't you talk about Gulf of Tonkin that
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:20.260]  they now admit was staged? Won't you talk... No, no. We're not talking about any of that.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:25.700]  No. They had you talking about our leaders of light who was again and again, and they
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:32.540]  said they needed an event like this to launch a preplanned war, whereas they would support
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.780]  the debunkers with further evidence via the narrative of what they had said. They did
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:43.540]  not mention P-N-A-C after you said that, and that was a tactic used time and time again.
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:48.140]  Which is what I did. I used their own documents. I gave them stacks of mainstream reports and
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.300]  their own documents. Right, and no mention whatsoever of Northwoods
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.460]  either. And they tried to play it as if the people we're interviewing, these experts,
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.380]  were there, you know, there at the scene. And they even interviewed the Popular Mechanics,
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:08.500]  yellow journalism, Hearst Publishing guy, at ground zero, just to give the impression
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.940]  that he was there as well, because they... And then Homeland Security Director's first
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.180]  cousin is the guy that directed the whole piece, and then they tried to lie and say
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.140]  he wasn't related, but they called his mother and she said, oh yeah, he comes over for dinner
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.660]  all the time. I mean, for those that don't know, Hearst Publishing, folks, is in the
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:32.260]  encyclopedia. You know, we're talking Citizen Kane here. They literally, yellow journalism
[00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:38.420]  means them. Right, and then just with the facts of it,
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:44.740]  they said that the Flight 93 debris field was not eight miles wide when the FBI and
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.860]  the NTSB admitted that it was. And we have the Associated Press.
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:56.260]  Yeah, and crash debris found eight miles away, Pittsburgh Tribune Review. They found papers
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.540]  from mail that was being transported from the plane eight miles from the crash site,
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.140]  and that's admitted by the FBI, but they just lied and said they basically implied that
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:08.940]  you made that up just because the river was one mile wide.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.580]  Oh, that was done here at the studios at the end of the radio interview. They were in here
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.380]  videotaping that. They said, oh, just a 20-minute interview and turned into, like, almost two
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:21.340]  hours, and they just kept saying, you're lying. That wasn't ever in the news. And
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:26.220]  I went, it's in AP. It's in Pittsburgh News. There was an engine four miles away. No, no,
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:30.500]  it's not. No, it's not. And I went, well, I go, well, let me go to the computer. I'll
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.740]  print them up. No, we know. We know it's not true.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:41.780]  I mean, and they had Spotnitz, the X-Files guy. I mean, it was like, it was like...
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.940]  They had the creator of the X-Files. I've seen that clip. That's what they promoed,
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.780]  going, they're just mentally ill, and they need to believe this, and it's just... And
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.780]  they get very upset, but they never exposed any of our facts, did they?
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:59.780]  No, and he was sat there talking uninterrupted, like, three or four minutes, whereas yourself
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:07.860]  or Dylan Avery got 10 seconds at best. And then it was told so as they were backed up,
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:14.740]  the debunkers, via the narrative, whereas you were dismissed as evangelists and dropouts.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.860]  Well, you know, in a contract agreement, I signed with them. I said, you've got to mention
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:23.360]  Infowars.com. And I guess that's why they put it on the BBC website, but accidentally
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.340]  got the link dead. Yeah, they also accidentally got the links
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:32.900]  dead to the 9-11 Commission on the NIST report, even though people had been emailing after.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.780]  And they didn't correct them, just by accident. Yeah, they want to go, here's the link to
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.260]  the report, but they don't want you to actually go read the NIST report that says, no, bombs
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:45.140]  could have been in the buildings. Oh, no, can't have that. Just say the NIST report
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:50.420]  says something else, and then, oh, the link's dead. We're sorry.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:56.380]  And Guy Smith, when you talked to him on Friday, said, assured you that it was a balanced piece.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:02.300]  And then hours after, up on the BBC website goes this questions and answers, what really
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:08.380]  happened, which was basically paraphrased from the Popular Mechanics piece, where they
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:14.700]  narrowly focused in, for example, on the demolition and said, oh, these squibs are just ejections
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.060]  of smoke as the floors are pressed onto one another. End of story.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:27.060]  But they're exploding seconds before it collapses. Right, so you've got this litany of supposed
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:33.100]  debunked questions about 9-11, which appear two days before the documentary, and yet this
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.420]  guy's still telling us it's a balanced piece.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:42.220]  But he's supposedly coming on my Monday syndicated show tomorrow. Paul, thanks for spending time.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.500]  Hit him hard. Get the reports out quick. Get a basic report out, and then I want a detailed
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.900]  report on PrisonPlanet.com by tomorrow. Thank you, Paul.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:50.900]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.500]  All right, absolutely incredible. All right, I promise. We'll go to T.J., George, Airman,
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.700]  and others, then get into the FBI, staging the Nazi rally. Stay with us.
