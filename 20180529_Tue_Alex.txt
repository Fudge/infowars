[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:22.000 --> 00:44.000]  Alex Jones.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.000]  We're broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, 29th of May, 2018 global transmission.
[00:56.000 --> 01:06.000]  Our own Harrison Smith and Trepid reporter, investigative journalist is on the ground with one of their team member in the UK.
[01:06.000 --> 01:17.000]  And he's going to be covering the continuing unfolding developments with the firestorm that is the secret arrest and secret imprisonment of Tommy Robinson.
[01:17.000 --> 01:31.000]  We are also going to have Godfrey Bloom, former member of the EU Parliament from the UK and a big patriot, joining us in the next hour to break down all the other political prisoners in the UK and in Europe.
[01:31.000 --> 01:55.000]  Gert Wilders, the Dutch leading politician close to winning the prime ministership there, he has gone and filed a formal complaint and says this is Sharia law and the tyranny of the Islamic takeover because in parliamentary systems it only takes 5, 10, 15% depending on the country to then leverage out and win every single election because you'll have up to 10, 15 major parties.
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  If the Islamists vote almost to a man and woman, they can then be the key tipping for every area.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  And that's why Sharia law is already going into effect in areas of London.
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  There are no go zones all over Europe.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  Just a few years ago, mainstream media denied this.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  Now they admit it and now they accept it.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.000]  It is incredible.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  But Tommy Robinson has captured the world's attention.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  Even Roseanne Barr tweeted out over the weekend that, oh, look, you exposed the pedophile rings, you get sent to prison in one hour.
[02:23.000 --> 02:32.000]  Folks go, oh, well, he's in contempt of court in a previous sentence for also covering the grooming gangs that he first exposed.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  So that is the reality of what we're dealing with here.
[02:35.000 --> 02:38.000]  So we're going to have Harrison Smith popping in.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  We're going to have Godfrey Bloom popping in.
[02:42.000 --> 02:52.000]  We're going to have members of Tommy Robinson's crew like Kalen Robertson, who really is not just his right-hand man, but the guy that's helped take Tommy the next level with the support he needed with infrastructure.
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.000]  And camera work and gentrification to use Kalen's term.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  He is going to be popping in to give us updates in the latest.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  And I'll just tell you this very, very soon.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  An exclusive piece of information is not today, tomorrow, but he's coming on today.
[03:07.000 --> 03:09.000]  Regardless, I'll leave it at that.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  Our people are on the ground with him in the UK.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  And then in studio again, he is one of the top First Amendment lawyers.
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.000]  So how about what's happening here, but also in Europe, Mark Rondaza is going to be in studio.
[03:21.000 --> 03:29.000]  We also have Mr. Nixon here, another lawyer receiving him on board, but working on some things behind the scenes.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  It's all coming up today.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  You definitely want to spread the word about this broadcast.
[03:33.000 --> 03:44.000]  Now, separately, you've got the fact that the media has been trying to spin things massively that, oh, Trump backed out of the summit and now it's back on.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  Oh, he's schizophrenic.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  Oh, he's ultra-skelter.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  Now, that's how the art of the deal works.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  It's how negotiations work.
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  Like, you're about to buy a car and they've agreed to sell it to you for $30,000 and suddenly, oh, you forgot about an add on cost.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  It's had more on the car than we thought.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  The car is $35,000.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  You say, oh, I'm walking.
[04:04.000 --> 04:05.000]  And they go, oh, you know what?
[04:05.000 --> 04:06.000]  We're going to take that off for you.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  You're right.
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.000]  It's a deal.
[04:08.000 --> 04:12.000]  The deal is $30,000.
[04:12.000 --> 04:13.000]  So that's what happened.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  And here's Trump's latest tweet.
[04:15.000 --> 04:25.000]  Sorry, I've got to start focusing on energy, on North Korea, nuclear, bad trade deals, VA choice, the economy, rebuilding the military, and so much more.
[04:25.000 --> 04:34.000]  And not on the rigged Russia witch hunt that should be investigating Clinton, Russia, FBI, Justice, Obama, Comey, Lynch, et cetera.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  Absolutely.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  Sorry, folks, because the media is challenging him to respond to all the latest Russiagate pitle.
[04:41.000 --> 04:45.000]  And he's saying, sorry, I'm going to continue turbocharging the country when it was about to go over the edge.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  So all that's coming up.
[04:46.000 --> 04:55.000]  And we've got Schumer tells the media that Spygate doesn't exist and don't report on it, even though we've got Clapper and Brennan, all of them admitting that they were spying on Trump.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.000]  These people are incredible.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  We'll be back.
[04:57.000 --> 05:22.000]  Stay with us.
[05:27.000 --> 05:53.000]  We'll be back.
[05:53.000 --> 06:15.000]  We'll be back.
[06:23.000 --> 06:52.000]  We have Katelyn Robertson and others who are members of Tommy Robinson's team joining us with exclusive information on the secret police arrest of a amazing journalist that has shocked the world.
[06:52.000 --> 06:53.000]  That's coming up the start of the next hour.
[06:53.000 --> 07:05.000]  We're also going to be joined by Godfrey Blum, a veteran military historian, a former member of the EU parliament, also a very famous and successful brokerage house operator.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  He's a real phenomenon, helped engineer the Brexit.
[07:08.000 --> 07:16.000]  He wants to explain what's really behind Tommy Robinson and other secret police activities that are explosive in the UK.
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.000]  He's going to dish out information never before heard.
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  And again, we're also looking at Nigel Farage for the next few days as our crew is there in the UK.
[07:28.000 --> 07:38.000]  Italy is about to explode because they're telling the Italians that they're under EU control and that their borders will be opened, whether they like it or not.
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  So that's all coming up as well.
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  And we have incredible developments with Schumer telling the media how to report on Spygate.
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  This guy, just like Hillary, has his fingers in the mainstream media.
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  In late night comics, you name it, telling them what to say and what to do.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  A memo to the press.
[07:55.000 --> 08:03.000]  When you quote the president saying Spygate, it is only fair to immediately follow that by noting there is absolutely no evidence of Spy being inserted into his campaign.
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  It seems to me, failure to do so is a disservice to your readers, viewers in the country.
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.000]  Now that real message is, I'll call your corporate bosses and have your ass fired if you don't tell the line.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  That's what Schumer does.
[08:17.000 --> 08:26.000]  He and his aides hours a day call up threatening people to get them in line.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.000]  Where does Jimmy Fallon?
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  Was it enough anti-Trump?
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  And a special phone call was made by Herr Schumer.
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  Fallon talked about how much trouble he got in from executives.
[08:36.000 --> 08:39.000]  So that's the incredible bullying we have.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  Clapper, Brennan, all of them on video admitting that Trump was being spied on.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  They say, oh, we don't like that type of word.
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.000]  That's all coming up.
[08:49.000 --> 08:54.000]  Also, Roseanne Barr, oh my gosh, goes on wild and racist, even though it's not.
[08:54.000 --> 09:01.000]  Tweetstorm about Clintons, George Soros, and Chris Salilzo.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  And you read it.
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  You know, Barr is such the big red-hot thing right now.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  And she was on the show a few times years ago because she said she was a listener.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  And you can tell she's a listener.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  And then she talks to my producer all the time.
[09:14.000 --> 09:15.000]  She says, oh, keep up the great work.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  I'll come on soon.
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  But never does.
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  I wonder if she's scared to come on as well.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  Because everybody's got to be afraid of the trailblazer and the tip of the spear.
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  See, our job is not to be popular with the establishment.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  Our job is to hit the barbed wire.
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  Our job is to cover uncomfortable, scary things so that there can be a larger debate about it.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  And you can see why the enemy wants to take us down.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  They know we're willing to break the facade, to blow through the enemy fortress walls,
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  and to open them up to larger attacks.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  That's our job.
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  And our listeners understand that.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  That's why they've had more than 50 articles I saw just last week trying to figure out how they can shut down info wars.
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  And the group suing me for the Newtown families.
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  The entire lawsuit is a misrepresentation of what I said, what I did.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  Statue limitations, all that applies.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  But they're the group that sued Remington, lost, and are on appeal.
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  That and other lawsuits caused Remington to announce bankruptcy.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  I'm on a search engine that.
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  So that's the type of enemies we're up against.
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  We've also, ladies and gentlemen, discovered something very interesting.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  That is going to be breaking later in the broadcast.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  And that deals with this whole Starbucks initiative.
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  And something very, very interesting and very, very newsworthy concerning it.
[10:41.000 --> 10:49.000]  That is quite frankly, devastating information.
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  We're not going to go to it yet.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  We're going to put a special report out by the end of the broadcast today.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  That shows you exactly what's going on with this social engineering.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  That's designed to cause division.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  And chips on the shoulders and social problems of the country.
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  Oh, look at drugs report.com.
[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  Look at drugs report.com right now.
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  Fears over 5g tech cancer from cell towers.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  New York CBS.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  That just broke.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  We guys print me an Asian get me these reports.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  Thank you.
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  Boy, who covered the 3g the 4g a decade ago?
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.000]  Who had scientists on?
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  Who read all the studies on air?
[11:31.000 --> 11:39.000]  And there's even an article out in the independent attacking me for talking about cell phone towers hurting you today.
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.000]  5g wireless services coming and so are health concerns over the towers that support it.
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  Well, they're not.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  They're not.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  Health concerns.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  They're absolute fact.
[11:55.000 --> 12:07.000]  That they just did a study last year with rats and 5g massively increased heart tumors and brain tumors.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  I sure don't want me one of them brain tumors.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  Do you?
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  But see, that's why they hate us.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  And I keep going back to this because they think we're all a bunch of nations of cowards.
[12:17.000 --> 12:23.000]  They think they're going to roll out this giant depopulation program.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  They think we're all stupid and we'll just adapt to dying.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  Well, I say we don't do that.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  And I say we stand up to Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and Google.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  Of course, they censor you when you send out an info wars.com link.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  Of course, they try to block you when you try to send out our videos.
[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  That's why you got to share them by hand.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  It's why you got to hand them out to people.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  It's why you got to download them and give people on disk.
[12:45.000 --> 12:49.000]  That's why you got to have viewing parties and say, this is the broadcast.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  This is the show.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  This is what the system fears.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  This is what they're trying to stop just like Tommy Robinson.
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  We got threatened out of the UK not to work with Tommy, not to fund Tommy, to desert Tommy.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  Tommy had a $400 used camera.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  So we bought him expensive cameras and gave him $20,000.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  Not a lot.
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  Not as much as we could do, but it's because I knew he was doing so much good.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  No strings attached.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  Just go out there and expose what's happening.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  What's the old saying?
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.000]  They're not sure who said it.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  When tyranny prevails, the best men rot in filthy jails.
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  And those that cried appease appease are hung by those they tried to please.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  You let tyranny go over into this tipping point.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  Once you go over to that point, everything collapses.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  You go into a Venezuela, a North Korea, a communist China overnight.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  You get all the yes men and women who have no honor, who line up to go along with it.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  But now the headline zero hedge up on info wars.com.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  We have it posted.
[13:59.000 --> 14:09.000]  Britain's rage over Robinson arrest as mass protest breakout worldwide in all over the country.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  We have it up on the street.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  People are talking about Tommy Robinson everywhere.
[14:12.000 --> 14:23.000]  So Harrison Smith and Kailin Robertson are going to go out the next day or so and just do live feeds seeing how angry and upset people are.
[14:23.000 --> 14:31.000]  It's all going to be covered here in info wars and the live streams and local radio stations and local TV stations you're listening to and watching.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  And we'll look at the worldwide protest country by country when we return on the other side.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  But remember, we have a Memorial Day week specials throughout this week.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  I can say that these are some of these are even better specials than we had during Christmas.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  We had some wider specials, hundreds of items on sale.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  We've got more than 15 on sale right now.
[14:53.000 --> 15:00.000]  But but on the storeable food, super high quality 50% off that is basically a loss leader.
[15:00.000 --> 15:07.000]  Power by my Patriots apply the highest quality, fresh, high quality, one month, three months, six months, 50% off and free shipping.
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.000]  The free shipping part is unprecedented on top of that.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  That special is about to end.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  We have 50% off brain force, our top quality.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  Neutropic.
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  It is better than top selling formulas that cost $60.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  People love it.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  It's 1995 right now.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  You will never find something anywhere close to that.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  That's a 4.8 stars out of thousands of reviews X to with bio true selenium.
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  They go together like a horse and carriage experience X to it is 50% off as well.

[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  It's all the same website info or store.com.
[15:52.000 --> 15:59.000]  It's info or life.com that she write to the supplements will be back as the world awakens to globalist heritage.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  Interested in trading as a way to generate extra monthly income.
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.000]  Listen up before you sign up for some garbage program or awkward in person seminar.

[20:23.000 --> 20:35.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:35.000 --> 20:42.000]  So we have the Pope's right-hand man in a secret trial in Australia
[20:42.000 --> 20:49.000]  where the court clerk was fired for even reading the charges privately.
[20:49.000 --> 20:58.000]  You have secret courts now in England with massive numbers of Muslims being tried and convicted
[20:58.000 --> 21:04.000]  for running giant child kidnapping and sexual exploitation rings.
[21:04.000 --> 21:11.000]  And you have Tommy Robinson, who first exposed it 11 years ago,
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  being tortured in prison for a year in general population,
[21:15.000 --> 21:19.000]  getting out a few years ago, going out and just covering the trial was happening,
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  being put in jail for that.
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  Now going and simply pointing out that there is a trial,
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  which you could even do under England's draconian law,
[21:28.000 --> 21:36.000]  and being given 13 months in jail within one hour revoking his suspended sentence,
[21:36.000 --> 21:39.000]  and demonstrations breaking out all over the world.
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  This is the type of thing that catches people's attention.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000]  Crowds climbing Saturday over 10 downing streets, gates, thousands in the streets.
[21:48.000 --> 21:53.000]  The media would show close video shots or close photos where you wouldn't see the crowd,
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000]  but we showed the crowd where it showed that it was thousands and thousands.
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  We've got some shots from up on top of the building and it's amazing.
[22:01.000 --> 22:06.000]  Headline from ZeroHedge.com, we have the full article posted at InfoWars.com as well.
[22:06.000 --> 22:13.000]  Britain's rage over Robinson arrest as mass protests break out worldwide.
[22:13.000 --> 22:21.000]  In Europe, in the US, in Australia, they're happening everywhere.
[22:21.000 --> 22:28.000]  And we've got the police all over the world trying to dial this back,
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  but it's not working and the more they try to suppress it, the bigger the pushback gets.
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  There's been at least six demonstrations have been held across Australia,
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.000]  in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Cambria, Brisbane, and other areas.
[22:42.000 --> 22:50.000]  Mass protests broke out all over England, not just in London on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  Tommy Robinson is a political prisoner whose life is in clear and pressing danger.
[22:55.000 --> 23:02.000]  German Member of Parliament Peter Beistrand said Saturday in a statement,
[23:02.000 --> 23:07.000]  Dutch Prime Minister, PM Gert Wilders showed up at the British Embassy in The Hague
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  to deliver his comments. We're going to play that in a moment.
[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  I'm here on behalf of millions. Freedom of Speech is being violated all over Europe
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  and also in Berlin. Let's talk freedom of speech. Gert Wilders, Dutch PM,
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  who's the leader to be their next president.
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  Wilders penned a letter to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs over the weekend
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  with five questions about Robinson's situation.
[23:30.000 --> 23:39.000]  And we've got also people like Godfrey Bloom joining us in the next hour,
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  coming out and saying it's an absolute tyranny,
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  but there are many other political prisoners.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  He's going to expose the situation, their fate coming up.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  Similar statements coming out, of course, Nigel Farage,
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  who we're looking for an interview the next few days with him directly in the UK.
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  It is all coming up as we see Europe and Australia and America and the UK
[24:00.000 --> 24:06.000]  awaken to just how authoritarian the political correctness movement is
[24:06.000 --> 24:12.000]  and how it's globally directed by the open foundation groups
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  who talk about how they want open society, but it's actually the opposite.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  So we'll be breaking that down with Katelyn Robertson,
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  the right-hand man of Tommy Robinson, you'd say as manager.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  And then we're also going to have Godfrey Bloom coming on.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  So that is in the second hour. You do not want to miss that information.
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.000]  We have Tommy's first message from prison posted up on infowars.com
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  via Katelyn Robertson.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  He was extremely eloquent when he joined me Sunday.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  That guy's on fire just like Tommy.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  And then we've also, again, are going to have the latest from Tommy.
[24:52.000 --> 24:58.000]  And I'm just going to leave it at that, but you may be hearing his voice here on air very, very soon.
[24:58.000 --> 25:03.000]  But I'm not going to count our chickens until they've hatched.
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  Not going to count a fish until it's in the boat on the ice.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  So pray for Tommy, support him.
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.000]  He is in a safer wing of the prison. They put him in a bigger prison.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  So he's not in general population with the Islamists who make up about half the prison population in London.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  They're let off by the way with slaps on the wrist because they're being used as a criminal underground of sex trade.
[25:27.000 --> 25:34.000]  You name it, that they operate in their own countries to be operated inside the UK for the British ruling criminal pedophile class.
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.000]  That is all coming down.
[25:37.000 --> 25:46.000]  Now, speaking of Gert Wilders, they've tried to kill him. They've tried to put him in prison for simply saying that Islam is a threat to Europe's future freedom.
[25:46.000 --> 25:55.000]  They've also indicted for the second time the leading nationalist, Marie Le Pen.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  And again, Marie Le Pen has pointed out to Trump and others.
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  Stop trying to pacify the left. Stop trying to work with them. They will never work with you.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  They want to conquer everyone. They're not going to stop. They're going for broke.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  It's time to be hardcore. It's what the people want. And Trump's been hardcore overall.
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  And we see him come out and be nice to the left so they then show their hand and ask for everything.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  But for our listeners, that message is true.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  All of us have to understand we're not trying to win a popularity contest at mainstream media.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  We're here to take them on.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  Just like Hitler talked bad about America during World War II.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  The globalists are going to say horrible things about us. They're going to attack us.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  They're going to lie about us. They're going to sue us. They're going to twist things.
[26:36.000 --> 26:43.000]  Because we're taking the country back from them and destroying their authoritarianism and they don't like it.
[26:43.000 --> 26:52.000]  Now, let's go ahead and go to this statement from in front of the Worldwide Embassy of England at the Hague.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  Here it is.
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  British Embassy in the Hague. And I'm here because I'm shocked and outraged.
[27:00.000 --> 27:06.000]  What happened in the United Kingdom last week is an absolute disgrace.
[27:06.000 --> 27:17.000]  Tommy Robertson, a freedom fighter and Islam critic, was jailed while the judge issued a gag order to silence the media.
[27:17.000 --> 27:24.000]  Freedom of speech is being violated all over Europe and also in Britain.
[27:24.000 --> 27:35.000]  The lights of freedom are going out. Islam critics are taken to court, jailed or targeted with fatwas.
[27:35.000 --> 27:46.000]  And the authorities try to silence us. However, Islamists are pampered, protected, defended and that is totally unacceptable.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  We will not accept this. Never.
[27:50.000 --> 27:59.000]  We will continue speaking the truth about Islam and horrendous crimes like rape, genital mutilation, honor killings and terrorism.
[27:59.000 --> 28:05.000]  For we protect our own people. Whatever the price may be.
[28:05.000 --> 28:11.000]  And that is why I stand here in solidarity with Tommy Robinson.
[28:11.000 --> 28:23.000]  Britain used to be a bastion of freedom of speech. Today its authorities are behaving like North Korea and Saudi Arabia.
[28:23.000 --> 28:32.000]  I'm here on behalf of millions. In the Netherlands, in Europe and also in Britain.
[28:32.000 --> 28:42.000]  And in their name, I say we will no longer be silent. Our future is at stake and we will protect it.
[28:42.000 --> 28:52.000]  Free Tommy Robinson. Release him from jail. Today, restore freedom of speech and stop gagging the people.
[28:52.000 --> 28:59.000]  That's Gert Wilders. I'm Alex Jones, the info war straight ahead with our reporter on the ground in London where there's a reporting gag.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  I tried other brands but I came back to my sunshine.
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best. Get a sunny bay heating pad.
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.000]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck or back or shoulder.
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny bay heating pad.
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[29:22.000 --> 29:31.000]  Sunny Bay heating pads are handmade with high quality, can be used at home or at work and have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  Why take another pill?
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  Many people use our sunny bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer can take its toll on your body.
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[29:45.000 --> 29:50.000]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care before we introduce them to the public.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  You can easily find Sunny Bay heating pads on Amazon.
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for Sunny Bay heating pads.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  That's why we have news sites like newswars.com that aren't as banned and aren't as blocked.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  So you can get those key stories out to warn people of what's happening.
[34:11.000 --> 34:25.000]  This just in, European Union approves Bayer, 62.5 billion takeover of GMO and pesticide giant, the good old folks at Monsanto.
[34:25.000 --> 34:33.000]  So that's two evil giants getting in bed together to make a horrific monster baby.
[34:33.000 --> 34:41.000]  Remember Bayer, the German company that worked of course with Hitler in World War II?
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.000]  But oh, that was World War II.
[34:42.000 --> 34:43.000]  I'm sure they didn't mean it.
[34:43.000 --> 34:49.000]  That's why they got caught in the 90s for over a decade working with Bill Clinton, I should add.
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  Because nobody else would take blood and then not test it and still certified as good.
[34:53.000 --> 35:10.000]  Creating factor eight and other blood products that gave estimated one million people, hepatitis A, B or C, or HIV and horrible death sentences.
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  But that's okay.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  California is legalized giving somebody HIV.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  So even though it can still kill some people, that's okay.
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  That's a liberal gift.
[35:18.000 --> 35:32.000]  So you got Monsanto famously dumping ox in the black neighborhoods and famously giving us Agent Orange and famously giving us all this GMO that in every study kills the rats and causes them to have huge tumors by the second generation.
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.000]  But that's okay.
[35:35.000 --> 35:43.000]  EU approves Bayer's 62 plus billion dollar takeover of GMO and pesticide giant Monsanto.
[35:43.000 --> 35:49.000]  But you know, Monsanto famously got to queue this up on short notice.
[35:49.000 --> 36:04.000]  Their top lobbyists would go all over the news for decades and would say over and over and over and over again that you could drink roundup.
[36:04.000 --> 36:15.000]  Glyphosate's brand name and that wouldn't hurt you. But then when he was confronted with the fact that Indian farmers were committing suicide by drinking and he said, oh, I'm not going to drink it.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  Are you crazy?
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  First, he says, of course, I'll drink it.
[36:19.000 --> 36:20.000]  They go, I have a glass right here.
[36:20.000 --> 36:21.000]  Are you crazy?
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  I'm not going to drink that.
[36:22.000 --> 36:28.000]  That's how dumb they think you are with 5G and the glyphosate.
[36:28.000 --> 36:36.000]  You know, Brazil had basically no breast cancer 20 years ago.
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  Isn't that just incredible?
[36:41.000 --> 36:47.000]  Now, think about that.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  Brazil had no breast cancer to speak of, very, very rare.
[36:52.000 --> 36:59.000]  But a few years after they adopted roundup, they're now just as high as the United States. Look it up.
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  It's amazing how these people operate.
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  EU approves Bayer.
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.000]  62.5 million takeover GMO, pesticide giant Monsanto.
[37:12.000 --> 37:13.000]  Isn't that just cute?
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  Isn't that just darling?
[37:17.000 --> 37:25.000]  They can just take their basic genetically stacked corn and things like that.
[37:25.000 --> 37:33.000]  And by the second generation, you have destruction of the DNA and the rats and massive tumors.
[37:33.000 --> 37:43.000]  By third generation, you have near complete sterility, but the few rats that are born or guinea pigs tend to, for some reason,
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  grow the testicles on top of their heads.
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  And hair grows out of their mouths. There's photos of this.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  And then the liberals always take that and make jokes about it.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  Like, oh, the frogs are sterile and they're gay.
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.000]  And oh, the rats have their testicles on top of their heads. It's funny.
[38:02.000 --> 38:03.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  Long running GMO study finds tumors in rats.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  That's one from 2013. They had studies before that.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  There's hundreds of these studies.
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  And then by the third generation, you can find the photos with the testicles on the head.
[38:15.000 --> 38:24.000]  That's just what happens and the hair growing out of the mouth.
[38:24.000 --> 38:27.000]  Now, when we come back from break, we're going to talk to our own Harrison Smith,
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  who's on the ground in London, England.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  And he's been out on the streets filing reports.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  He's got a lot of people to talk to.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  There's a supposed reporting ban there right now,
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.000]  even admitting that there's Muslim grooming gangs or on where Tommy Robinson is.
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  I'd say that attempt to ban it has failed.
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  Suddenly we're seeing British newspapers reporting on it,
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.000]  though with a hateful tone towards Tommy and anyone else that supports him.
[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  But you could say they're losing this PR battle big time.
[38:56.000 --> 39:01.000]  And there's demonstrations all over Australia, all over Europe, demonstrations in the U.S.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  It's amazing.
[39:02.000 --> 39:08.000]  We've got the zero hedge article, zero hedge dot com article on info wars dot com right now.
[39:08.000 --> 39:17.000]  It is critical to get that information out as fast as possible to keep this thing rolling.
[39:17.000 --> 39:25.000]  And the longer he's in prison, the more that the state is protecting Islamist will become evident.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  I mean, you can make a film about this whole subject.
[39:28.000 --> 39:35.000]  It's on record that returning ISIS and Al Qaeda members for many years are given the best housing,
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  the best free cars, the best welfare.
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  While pensioners, 75, 80 year olds retirees, that's what they call them over there as pensioners,
[39:44.000 --> 39:51.000]  retirees are having their gas allotments taken that we're talking are 300, 400 pounds a winter.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  And you can get really cold in England and you hear about old people on buses so they don't freeze to death
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  and being kicked off the buses as they'll drive around at night because their powers off,
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  they don't have money.
[40:02.000 --> 40:09.000]  So they're curled up in all these blankets and England gets really cold and really wet and thousands a year now die.
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  But don't worry, the Queen of England got hundreds of millions of pounds that came out in the news for her palaces.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  She got her gas allotment.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  The Queen gets taxpayers to pay for her gas allotment.
[40:20.000 --> 40:30.000]  So it's all snug as a bug in a rug, but old people, they don't get anything in the UK because they're just old dirty brits.
[40:30.000 --> 40:36.000]  They need to roll over and die and make room for guys in nightgowns, 80 plus percent that don't work,
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  that are on welfare, who have a side job trafficking your daughter.
[40:39.000 --> 40:46.000]  And if you give them any problems, the CPS comes and takes your kids from you and gives them to Muslim families.
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  That's on record because you'll put up with it.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  Thomas Jefferson was once asked, what is the limit of tyranny man can live under?
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  And he said, the limit is that which you will accept.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  True words have never been stated.
[40:58.000 --> 41:11.000]  He also said, we will not be transported towards liberty on a feathered bed.
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.000]  We're going to come back and actually show you some of the wide shot videos where you just see thousands of people demonstrating.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  It's amazing.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  We're going any further.
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.000]  If you don't support this broadcast, the globalist will be successful in shutting us down and blocking us.

[45:00.000 --> 45:11.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[45:16.000 --> 45:24.000]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  It is a classical 360 win.
[45:26.000 --> 45:36.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[45:36.000 --> 45:53.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[45:56.000 --> 46:07.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield InfoWarsLife.com.
[46:27.000 --> 46:36.000]  Go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against the InfoWars, psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[46:39.000 --> 46:54.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com, forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[46:54.000 --> 46:59.000]  That is critical to this fight. We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[47:25.000 --> 47:44.000]  Imagine if I told you as I did a decade ago that in the future, the governments would be opening their borders and bringing in tens of millions of Islamists and allowing them to rape little girls, children, to have people in massive sex trade.
[47:44.000 --> 47:57.000]  The Islamic mayor is over London, but the head of the border patrol and the Home Office and the paramilitary police, the federal police in the UK would be an Islamist, not even born in the country.
[47:57.000 --> 48:12.000]  And that they would be absolutely engaged in a reign of total control and that activists that exposed massive child kidnapping rings, confirmed, convicted, would then be in jail for talking about it on the streets of London, Tommy Robinson.
[48:12.000 --> 48:21.000]  Well, we've got a raft of interviews with Tommy Robinson's crew coming up today with the latest developments with Nigel Farage with Godfrey Bloom on the scene.
[48:21.000 --> 48:33.000]  So we're going to have HD interviews from England coming out also on the show via Skype. We've got so much because this is that big trigger point. This is the big awakening happening right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:33.000 --> 48:43.000]  This is historic and info wars.com and news wars.com. This is weird. The tip of the spear getting Trump elected tip of the spear exposing fluoride giving you brain cancer and bone cancer.
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.000]  Now Harvard admits it tip of the spear exposing global government tip of the spear exposing everything.
[48:49.000 --> 48:59.000]  We are now at the tip of the spear of this fight because of your support your prayers. So thank you all. Please support the local station you're listening to spread the word about the local station.
[48:59.000 --> 49:10.000]  Become a sponsor. Support the sponsors. This is a time to stand boldly against the enemy. You think the folks at the Texas Revolution were popular in Santa Ana's ranks? No.
[49:10.000 --> 49:22.000]  You think I'm popular in the globalist ranks? You think I'm trying to win a popularity contest? I'm trying to change the world putting my life on the line and I'm willing to do it because I know we can win and because I know you're supporting us.
[49:22.000 --> 49:35.000]  So joining us above Waterloo station is Harrison Smith, our Trevor reporter and crew. They're going to be out and about doing live feeds today in London and there are more demonstrations were told coming up.
[49:35.000 --> 49:46.000]  So Harrison, break down what you've witnessed the historic developments that are unfolding and your take being inside England right now for all intents and purposes is a police state.
[49:46.000 --> 50:00.000]  Under their current law, they could jail you for what you're about to say, even though that's a false interpretation. The law is corrupt. They selectively let other media outlets report it, but other media outlets in the UK are given denotices and told they can't report.
[50:00.000 --> 50:08.000]  This is outrageous, but then returning ISIS and Al Qaeda members are given free housing and coddled. It's incredible.
[50:08.000 --> 50:22.000]  Yeah, it is. Well, the good news is that the reporting ban has been lifted as of today, I believe. So now the story is actually getting out a little bit and hopefully that means that more Brits will be aware of exactly what's going on.
[50:22.000 --> 50:31.000]  That's going to be the topic of our on the street interviews today. We're going to go out and see if people have heard about it and what they think about it and get the general consensus here.
[50:31.000 --> 50:46.000]  Your statement about England being a police state is exactly right. And I've never been here before. But when we arrived yesterday, I mean, that was the first thing that struck me was not just the sort of overt presence of control mechanisms around such as just
[50:46.000 --> 51:02.000]  you know, things like just in front of the escalator, they have these these metal bars to stop you from carrying bags on. It's like it's like, you know, an amusement park where everything is soft and nothing's too dangerous. I mean, there's this this weird sense of sort of treating everybody like
[51:02.000 --> 51:09.000]  children and obviously that goes over to the imperial conditioning, the imperial programming. That's domestication.
[51:09.000 --> 51:21.000]  Yeah. And, and so yesterday we went to the gates at Downing Street at Whitehall, where the protest had gone on from Friday to Sunday, they had died out by the time we got there. Now you're seeing video of it here.
[51:21.000 --> 51:32.000]  So we were at that gate that the police presence was definitely increased, although there was not big crowds of people. We did as we're walking down the street, we hear this chant of Tommy Robinson's name.
[51:32.000 --> 51:43.000]  And so we sort of sought that out. And there were a couple guys standing on the street sort of still protesting and keeping it alive. But I do have a message from Tommy Robinson.
[51:43.000 --> 51:55.000]  This is something that he wants everybody to hear. He had a phone call with his wife and some of his crew earlier today and his message is that the big protest will be on the 9th. It'll be June 9th.
[51:55.000 --> 52:06.000]  And so there will be more details about that coming, but that is the date that is coming up. That will be the big demonstration. And that's what I have from Tommy today and then tomorrow.
[52:06.000 --> 52:14.000]  If our luck holds out, we will be having an exclusive with Tommy Robinson. And that just sort of depends on.
[52:14.000 --> 52:25.000]  Let's not get into the details exactly because they'll obviously try to do something there. But that's great. Get an interview with his wife, get an interview with his crew. We've got Kailin Robertson coming on.
[52:25.000 --> 52:37.000]  His interview Sunday was powerful. It went viral, drudged link to it. Millions and millions of views. And that's with the censorship. They still couldn't suppress infowars because of how powerful his message was.
[52:37.000 --> 52:49.000]  And he just said everywhere. People are talking about Tommy Robinson. They're upset. The denotus to where they didn't know what was happening and that the media wouldn't even say that he'd been arrested or put in prison.
[52:49.000 --> 52:57.000]  I think this has really crossed the line. I think this is a real point of no return and event horizon. Harrison, what do you think?
[52:57.000 --> 53:11.000]  Yeah, it definitely is. And I think the fact that they have now removed that that ban that they had placed on it really says that they kind of realized their mistake because definitely it's the it got a lot more attention.
[53:11.000 --> 53:18.000]  The fact that they banned, you know, talking about it, you know, it's the typical Streisand effect. I mean, it happens every time and it's like they don't learn their lesson.
[53:18.000 --> 53:29.000]  But they they ban this and just, you know, the the awareness of its skyrockets and also some good news from Tommy's crew is that the donations are pouring in to help his legal fund.
[53:29.000 --> 53:41.000]  They have pretty high hopes about about the outcome of that and being able to, you know, work some magic legally to hopefully at least get him some protection in jail.
[53:41.000 --> 53:55.000]  Well, if not, you know, released early although, you know, they haven't said anything concrete. They are saying that the donations are coming in rapidly and and that they say Americans are really pulling way more than their share of the weight.
[53:55.000 --> 54:06.000]  And, you know, they just say Americans, you know, anything free speech in the speech free speech realm Americans just open their hearts and and and really pour out goodwill.
[54:06.000 --> 54:14.000]  Well, they also understand that Tommy is has been a champion from the beginning, exposing this whole situation.
[54:14.000 --> 54:21.000]  They also understand that that that Tommy has gone through hell, lost his business, lost everything.
[54:21.000 --> 54:28.000]  They understand that he is the archetypal hero and they know what we've been through. They know what Trump's been through his family.
[54:28.000 --> 54:36.000]  You know, as Trump supporters wearing a make America great again hat or wearing an info wars dot com or a Hillary for prison shirt, they know what we go through.
[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  And they know about the harassment, the PIs and the lawsuits.
[54:40.000 --> 54:46.000]  I mean, Matt drugs basically wears a disguise when he's out in public.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  Right.
[54:47.000 --> 54:54.000]  And I mean, not like a Groucho Marx, you know, mask or anything, but you know, I mean, because that's what this has turned into.
[54:54.000 --> 55:06.000]  It's up against a tyranny where no, we know we are and we know that they're using Islam as their battering ram to bring it in and then make us comply to it when it's not compatible with our culture and our society.
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  So I'm against bombing the Muslims and invading them.
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  I was against all those wars.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  And now I'm against them coming here and taking us over as well.
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  And just as they've said, nobody invited these folks.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  Nobody said we're going to conform to you.
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.000]  We're tired of it.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  Go ahead.
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  Well, yeah, they didn't ask the people here that that was one thing Tommy Robinson has a very powerful speech where he says they never asked us.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  They never asked us if we wanted to be subjected to this.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.000]  They just enforced it upon us.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  That's, you know, it's a top down control.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  It's not democracy.
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  It's not anything like democracy.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  And yeah, and you know that most places can't talk about this.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  And that's what's so important about info wars.
[55:40.000 --> 55:47.000]  That's what I said from my report yesterday in front of the gate saying, look, you know, you need institutional power to be able to do stuff like this.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  You need to be able to send a reporter, you know, at a split notice from Texas to London to cover this.
[55:52.000 --> 56:01.000]  And most places that have that institutional power, they have they're under the they're under the control of the greater institutions, right?
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.000]  That's right.
[56:02.000 --> 56:03.000]  We don't have any institutions.
[56:03.000 --> 56:14.000]  And if you read the original Clinton Foundation documents from their law library, not the new foundation, but their presidential law library, the first thing they said in 1993 is we cannot allow
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  Christian or American style institutions.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  We must stop the Western Journalism Center and Joseph Farah.
[56:22.000 --> 56:25.000]  So they said we can't let them sell books.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  We can't let them make money.
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.000]  We've got to call them conspiracy theorist and we've got to ridicule them, selling anything.
[56:32.000 --> 56:38.000]  Because if they kickstart an economy, people are hungry for it and it'll build an ecosystem.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  And they call it the vast right wing conspiracy today.
[56:41.000 --> 56:48.000]  No, it's the vast common sense Americana free market system where we want to be free and we want to be left alone.
[56:48.000 --> 56:55.000]  And we're not bound to communism, globalism, socialism, Islam, pedophilism, globalist, Vaticanism, any of it.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  We are done, Hollywoodism, all of it.
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.000]  We're done with these groups trying to conquer us, Starbucks and all its George Soros brainwashing.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  We stand against it and we're saying no.
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.000]  Harrison Smith, great job.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  And we've got a raft of things coming up.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[57:12.000 --> 57:21.000]  And then we've got Kailin Robertson, really Tommy Robinson's manager joining us to talk about the latest developments straight ahead.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  Harrison, thank you so much.
[57:23.000 --> 57:24.000]  Thanks Alex.
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  And you're doing some live feeds today.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  So David Knight's host is the fourth hour.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  And so if that happens, pop in then or pop in later with us.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  Thank you so much.
[57:33.000 --> 57:34.000]  Sounds good. Thanks.
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  The number one thing you can do right now folks under enemy attack and enemy censorship is tell folks about that local station you're listening to.
[57:39.000 --> 57:46.000]  And spread the article, spread the videos and email out the link to infowars.com forward slash show.
[57:46.000 --> 58:10.000]  Stay weather sour number two, only minutes away.
[58:16.000 --> 58:24.000]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[58:24.000 --> 58:31.000]  With inadequate thyroid hormones, you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[58:31.000 --> 58:37.000]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.
[58:37.000 --> 58:50.000]  Take control of your chemistry today with this super combo. Discover the power of Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium at infowarslife.com.
[58:50.000 --> 58:56.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an info wars life.
[58:56.000 --> 58:57.000]  It take hours.
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[58:59.000 --> 59:00.000]  It's stronger.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  It's back in stock.
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.000]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  It's got the preglonone.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  So you can upload it.
[59:18.000 --> 59:27.000]  And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine four to five toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  That's a spray you do.
[59:28.000 --> 59:29.000]  You can also swallow it.
[59:29.000 --> 59:35.000]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver and a lot more without you.
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.000]  We couldn't do it.
[59:36.000 --> 59:41.000]  So thank you all for remembering infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you.
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  It's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  It's so essential to spread the word again.
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  Thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Arping on wars, we fight and griping about the way things are to be.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  And I don't mind them switching sides and standing up in things they believe in.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  When they're running down my country, man, they're walking on the fighting side.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  Old Monroe Haggard set that one line, yeah, hear about some squirrely guy who just don't believe in fighting.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  And I wonder, you know, I'm an anti-war guy when it comes to offense.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  And the globalists have put us in all these wars to build our world government at our expense.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  But at the same time, that doesn't mean that I hate our military.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  And that is what the globalists have done.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  They have us carry out these missions.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  Then they use their own publications to demonize the very missions they're making money off of.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  And then our men and women in uniform are getting their arms and legs blown off for.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  And when they get back, they give them horrible medical care.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  We're getting Kailin Robertson on the line via Skype.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  He was on fire Sunday night during the broadcast laying out the energy of the country.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  What's happening now demonstrations across the country.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  Demonstrations across Europe, across Australia, now some here in the U.S.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  But there's a big demonstration coming up.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  We talked to Mr. Robinson's wife, who's very, very private, you know why.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  They've got a Fadawa out against them.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  That's a hit, a contract, a religion of peace, wanting to kill him and his family.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  And they were there screaming and yelling at him.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  There's even a video of this dragging their fingers across their necks to him saying,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  we're going to get you and your family when the police arrested him for daring to stand outside a courthouse
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  and point out that they were having Muslim grooming gang trial inside.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  Think about that.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  Think about how far all this is going.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Tommy Robinson online.com is the website that Kailin Robertson helped set up.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  He gave the infrastructure he needed, the camera work, all of it.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  People can donate there, and as you heard earlier, from Tommy Robinson's wife through our man in England now over there,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  Harrison Smith, that does the lion's share.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  The donations are coming from right here in the United States and of course from this broadcast.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  So we really appreciate the listeners, what they're doing.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  But remember, as Harrison was saying, we've got to have the institution.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  The Clinton said, we fear an institution.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  The first thing they saw before Drudge even showed up two years later.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  He already had his email list, but he wasn't online in the classical web with drudgerport.com.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  They say in there, and I keep going back to this little obscure piece of obscurity, obscura.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  The Western Journalism Center, this could spread.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  We need to shut them down.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  We can't let them sell books.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  We've got to ridicule that.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  We've got to put regulators on them.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  We've got to stick the IRS on them.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  I know Ferry even looked at suing them, the statute of limitations.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  It's the same thing today.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  They're just working behind the scenes with lawyers and groups to shut us down, to crush us so they can crush you.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Because we're here pointing out when people are getting censored.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  And when we get censored, Drudge points out we're getting censored.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  And when Tommy gets censored, we point out he's being censored, so we're watching each other's backs.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  But it wasn't until infowars.com and drudgerport.com covered Tommy that there was even any coverage in this country.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  Sky News, others, they just took the reports down when the British government ordered it.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  So that's why I keep harping on how important info wars is.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  Now important is that you go to infowarstore.com while we have free shipping on our best-selling items.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  And 50% off on more than 15 items like X2, like Rainforest Plus, like the real Red Pill,
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  Plus, now, it's all there.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Plus, this means when we, under the whole FDA rules, when you update a brand or a formula, you have to change the name.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  So we just call it Plus.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  That just means better, higher quality.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Bodies is amazing.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  It's all there, infowars.com.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  We'll be right back with Katelyn Robertson.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  I want to plow into all of this.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts,
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  And I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  infowarslife.com, or triple-A-253-3139.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  We are launching our biggest recruitment and hiring operation ever in our 23-year history.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:23.000]  As we prepare to go 24 hours a day live on TV and radio from the infowars news center here in Austin, Texas.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000]  We're looking for video editors, live show producers, people that can run live TV and radio, investigative journalists.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  We're looking for reporters out in the field who can stay where you are currently yet.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  We're looking to hire around 15 people, maybe even more, as we take the information war to the next level in the face of the globalist.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  So please go to infowars.com, go to infowars.com forward slash contest, and you'll find the links to our major hiring drive.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  And we're also launching, as I just alluded to, a major reporter contest with $26,000 in prizes.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  First place, $20,000, second place, $5,000, third place, $1,000.

[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  It has a massive effect, and you've seen many of the reporters that have worked here over the years, like David Knight and others.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  They weren't even contest winners, but they were runner-uppers.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  But even if you don't want to be part of the contest and just want a shot at working here, we're looking for camera people.

[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  Now, we're going to be hiring right through into 2019 in this big expansion.

[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  And we are taking it directly to the globalist because we are the resistance.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color and creed who love liberty, that want to join the fight.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  Again, infowars.com forward slash contest to find all the rules and I'll see you on the front lines of the fight against the NWO.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin broadcasting worldwide on satellite, internet, AM, FM, UHF, VHF cable.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. This is the Black Sheep Broadcast.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  This is the cutting edge, the real tip of the spear, the hated sword in the fight against the globalist.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  And proud to be in that position. But I keep pointing that out because they've got their demonization campaign going against me like I'm a foreign government.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  They're getting ready to invade hundreds of thousands of articles, hundreds of thousands lying about us in the last few years.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Just last week, I looked it up in a full search. They published in more than 10,000 newspapers lies about me and Sandy Hook and the same group that sued Remington firearms to bankrupt them.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  Same group out of Connecticut. They beat the suit. They're just going out of business. Oldest firearms company in the nation.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  Over 10,000 news articles demonizing is lying about us and putting out the lies that are in that suit. And that didn't count the TV stations.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  I did a Lexus Nexus search. Guess what? Over 5,000 TV stations came up doing it as well.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  I mean, when I say hundreds of thousands folks, they are hitting us like cold war propaganda level because they've said if they can crush info wars, they're going to do it to everyone.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  This is the fight. Now we're getting Kailin Robertson on. He's having some trouble with the Skype for some reason where he's at the heroic gentleman fighting right alongside Tommy Robinson, helping take Tommy to the next level.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  And joining us later is Godfrey Bloom, one of the most fiery members of the European parliament. He's now out of the parliament getting into the media fight.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  Military historian, veteran, patriot, helped lead the Brexit. Here's his breakdown on Tommy Robinson and what he had to say about the worldwide demonstrations that are taking place right now.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  This Tommy Robinson business, and I've never met the fellow and I don't know anything about the case, but that's the point. It appears he's been sent to prison for 13 months and I don't know anything about the case. I don't know what the legal implications are. I don't know what the offence was. I don't know anything about it at all.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  All I know is what I've seen on social media. And it didn't look to me like he'd done anything wrong, but I don't know. I don't know. And neither do you.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  So what I'm suggesting is what is really, really wrong is the judge actually closing down any press comment on this.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  So the country doesn't know whether Tommy Robinson deserves to go to prison or not. We don't know. How can we make our own judgment on whether justice has been seen to be done or whether natural justice has been done?
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  And moreover, there is a caveat, is there not, that we have had one man sent to prison for putting a piece of bacon outside a mosque. He was given a year's sentence. It was only about three weeks before he was murdered.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  And another one came a little bit after that, and it was only about a week before he was attacked. Now what bothers me is, I think we all know, and a lot of my friends in both the police and the prison service tell me that there are some prisons which are run by the inmates,
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  a significant number of whom are natural enemies of Tommy Robinson, whether indeed he is safe or not. And I suspect that he isn't.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  All these things we don't know, all these things as citizens in a free society, we should be able to make our own judgments on, but we can't because they've closed down any press freedom on this.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  I'm 68 years old, you know. I'm just wondering where this country is going. I'm honestly wondering where this country is going, because it seems to me we're going back to sort of the East Germany of the Soviet Union.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  No freedom of speech, no freedom at all for the ordinary citizen to express his views, whether they be right, wrong or indifferent, it doesn't matter.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  That's a whole point of free speech that we can say what we like, when we like, as long as we're not actually hurting anybody else in the spirit of John Stuart Bell, for example.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  So this Tommy Robinson thing makes me deeply uneasy, and I think it makes us all deeply uneasy. And I think when we students are losing faith in the judicial system, it's the thin end of the wedge.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  And it's the end of a civilized society as we know it. I hope I don't go to prison for actually making this observation. Maybe I will, who knows.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  That's right. When he made that a few days ago, there was a reporting ban on it when Harrison Smith shot outside 10 Downing Street yesterday. It was a reporting ban when our good friend Kailin Robertson joined us, really the right hand man and the manager of
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Thomas. Well, Tommy's been so much more effective. He's had good support to last year and a half. I mean, who knows if he'll get arrested for when he came on Sunday, but I'm told we're going to break here in a moment, my friend, but I'm told Kailin that the reporting ban has now been lifted. Looks like this blew up in their face.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  It just has been lifted. I believe it was from massive pressure from a couple of local newspapers actually demanded that it was removed, which means, you know, it wasn't really properly standing in the first place if it was able to be taken away just with that little amount of pressure. So that's really, really good.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  That means I can now reveal to you in the next few minutes exactly what happened in the courtroom, exactly what was said back and forth legally, and we can go into that little bit, which is really good. Yeah, it's very good news.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  Wow. I didn't realize you can now tell folks what really happened in the courtroom. This is going to be an exclusive then. Well, I assume I can look at this is what happens when a press ban is lifted. It means that you can talk about what actually went on in the case.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  You can't talk about the case with the grooming scandal. That still has a press restriction, but you can talk about what happened here. So I have some notes. Obviously, I didn't didn't bring a pen and paper in the courtroom with me because it was such a short notice, which is what they really wanted.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  But I've written down what I remember. So I'm Kailin Robertson. I am blown away that we're getting the first look at this information that he were even scared to tell me privately over the phone and Skype in the weekend, what was happening.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  Though you told me some in confidence, but I didn't repeat it obviously because I couldn't. But now we're going to find out the public's going to find out what happened in that courtroom when he was sent away for 13 months for daring to just say that there was a Muslim grooming case going on period.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  The Tommy Robinson Firestorm continues on the other side. Stay with us.

[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:14.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  The most important thing that actually caused a little bit of a gasp in the room from a couple of the press was when the judge actually admits that he hadn't watched the full live stream of Tommy talking. He'd only watched a very, very brief moment of it before he made up his mind, which is really significant because that's at the center of this whole case.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  He didn't even watch the full thing. He looked at what Tommy actually said. It was just a couple of out-of-contact seconds, and that's really, really, really critical, really significant. It seems that he just made up his mind before any of this even started.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  I would say that's the most significant thing that happened there in a second, is that it was acknowledged in the courtroom by Tommy's appointed lawyer, not his official lawyer, because we didn't have time to put that into place, but the one that they gave him from the state, that if he goes to jail, it's extremely likely that he won't survive.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  He said he's had six attempts, very, very credible threats on his life where the police had to actually remove him from a situation where they've had someone like Al Qaeda or a very, very serious group, probably a terrorist attack on him.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  He said he's one of the most high-profile targets in the UK, and if he goes to jail, it's a very, very high likelihood that he's not going to survive.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  And the judge didn't seem to really be bothered about it, but it was acknowledged in the courtroom. He didn't really respond to it. He sort of said, oh, well, you know, that's it.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  He said that freedom of speech comes with consequences. That was probably one of the opening statements of what he said. He repeated it a couple more times.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  And he acknowledged that Tommy was on a suspended sentence from a previous thing last year. The judge said that he would have done this and given the same sentence to Tommy that he did a few days ago, regardless of that suspended sentence.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  He basically said it was irrelevant. He had nothing to do with it. So everybody who's saying, oh, well, of course he's being pushed to jail.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  His on a suspended sentence. It's actually irrelevant in this case. And the judge didn't really seem to be bothered about it.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  So those are the key, key points that I managed to note down from the room. It was such a short trial. There wasn't really much else mentioned. It was sort of in and out, a bit of a kangaroo core type thing.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]  So those are the main points.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  Kailin, I am rarely speechless as everyone knows. I am, my head is spinning as I look at these notes. He said, this is the consequence of your free speech. So a direct attack on the Magna Carta, you name it. And then said, this has nothing to do with your suspended sentence for covering another trial.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  I'm putting you in prison for this. And so, wow, how long did he then sentence him? We've heard 13 months. This is just, this is just mind blowing.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  Yeah, I can confirm it was 13 months. I know he did. They did say that there's a chance that it could be reduced to, I think, half of that on good behavior, that standard practice.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  So, you know, if that goes out throughout, you know, if he survives, if we don't get to that earlier, it would be around six and a half months on good behavior. But the actual sentence is 13 months.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  And let's be clear. He was attacked many times when he spent a year in prison. He was attacked when he was in for a few months last year. We showed news articles about that.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  A man that put a piece of bacon by a mosque, he was killed within a week of being in jail. Everybody else that criticizes Islam gets stabbed.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  So, there's the headline, Bacon on Mosque Offender Dies in Prison. The death penalty for putting a piece of bacon by the mosque that actually wasn't even on the mosque.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  So, they know exactly what they're doing. I'm also told that the judge was laughing and enjoying himself when the lawyer for Tommy, the barrister or the solicitor, brought up the fact that it'll be a death sentence if he's in jail, that the judge just didn't care.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  I can't confirm if he was laughing and enjoying himself at the same time when he said that. I think that was a mix of reports of when he was sort of smirking through the window, which was earlier, looking down when we were outside.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:30.000]  But he didn't really acknowledge it when the lawyer said that it's very likely he could die in jail. He's had really serious threats on his life.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  So, you're saying the same judge? Because this has all been secret until five minutes ago. The same judge is the one that sent a statement?
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  The one who was in the window that we took a picture of is the same person.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  So, the judge running the grooming trial is the one that also imprisoned the reporter for standing on the street. Wow, judge, jury and executioner. This is mega-city. This is Judge Dredd.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  Yeah, well, it's a really, really bizarre situation. It's a really, really bizarre case. I don't have full notes into the very, very, very, very...
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  Well, let me tell you, you're doing an incredible job, Kalen Robertson. I'm going to go to break and come back in about three minutes.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  But talk about, I know she's a very private lady, how Tommy's wife's doing, how the children are doing. I know there's a fight all the way out, a Muslim hit on them for years.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  But, I mean, how she's taking it, because you've met with her today.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  Yeah, well, obviously, I don't want to go into his family's lives too much because they're very private people like you've acknowledged.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:42.000]  But they're obviously very upset by it, but they're being very strong that they're dealing with it in the best way possible. They're just doing the same thing that we're doing right now, which is going down the legal battle, which is getting the best people we can to represent him, which is going down that route.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  So, yeah, that's what they're doing right now.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  And that's why you've got Tommy Robinson online.com. I've talked to you privately, I'll just say it. There's enough for part of the legal battle, very expensive to get good barristers, good legal counsel in England, even more expensive than the U.S.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  We're talking about 10,000 pounds a day or so when they're in court, tens of thousands in preparations, and the family obviously needs your support.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  So, Tommy Robinson online.com, infowarstore.com is how you support us. We've also been supporting Tommy. I'm going to make another donation myself tomorrow.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  But when you fund us, we become an institution, try to fund Project Veritas, what Tommy's doing, and so many others with no strings attached.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  That's how we've done it. So, we've got a lot of specials at infowarstore.com like Brainforce Plus, the amazing Neutropic, 50% off and you know.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  They've got Soros back groups and Hillary back lawyers that are direct lawyers for Hillary suing me all over the place.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  As fast as we throw them out, they file new ones, but the group that sued Remington into bankruptcy, they lost the case, but the same group is now suing me in Connecticut.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  So, I'm not whining. I came to this fight to take on the globalist, but they are in full gear against everybody that stands up for the truth.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  Donald Trump, myself, Roger Stone, infowars.com, they've come after my family. They've tried to take my children away. You've seen it all in the news.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  I'm not complaining. I'm just saying, if you support us, you pray for us. You back us. We will stand. We will not be defeated.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  But pray about it and decide who you want to support in this fight. I just know that behind the scenes, I've funded now hundreds of thousands in the child rescue groups here in the U.S.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  And we've had big successes with that because it's morally had to do it. God put it on my heart. I've funded what Tommy's doing. I've funded what Veritas is doing.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  And I'm trying to fund more things and they know I'm doing that, so they're really pissed at me because I'm like a super baby Soros.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  You know, I've only given out probably a million dollars over the years to groups fighting tyranny. I haven't given out 50 billion like Soros because I don't have the money.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  And I just want to take the money we get here from you to just maximize our fight back against them.

[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.

[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:50.000]  Katelyn Robertson is Tommy Robinson's manager, an amazing researcher, camera person that kicked out of university for just mildly criticizing Islam a few years ago and is now on the front lines of the fight the last year and a half with Tommy.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  Tommy is a world famous political prisoner of the West now and you just got the exclusive on what happened at the 30 minute trial and sentencing not for his previous suspended sentence.
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  The judge said no for what you've done. Incredible. And then during the break, he gave us the latest talking to Tommy this morning while he was there with his wife. And so you're going to hear the latest from Tommy directly from Katelyn about this big demonstration that Tommy wants to happen on June 9th.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  This is the exclusive directly from Tommy's manager. So Katelyn lay this out for us.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  Well, we can only get very, very tiny snippets of information from Tommy each day, very, very tiny number of seconds. But this morning, we actually made contact.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  And we wanted to see if he wanted to still go ahead with us, you know, working with these demonstrations and actually pulling something together. And he said, why don't you do it on the 9th? I fully support that. Do it outside Downing Street. Do it where we did Day for Freedom.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  Go ahead. So that's Tommy's public endorsement of what we want to do on the 9th that's coming up this month right outside Downing Street. As I said, where we did Day for Freedom, we want to get as many people there as possible.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  I'm still going to be working with people who can perhaps be speaking, but we just want to have the biggest show of basically force and support of Tommy that's sort of ever happened in Britain.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  So that's going to go ahead. That's the first time it's been mentioned. And yeah, it's under Tommy's approval. It's what he wants to go ahead with.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  Very, very historic. You know, I know his wife's very, very private. When I've been talking to Tommy and stuff, I only talked to her a few times.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  I know that the last times he's been thrown in prison for standing up for little children that are being kidnapped and raped in MASH, that his children were small enough to not really know what happened to Daddy, but now they are.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  Can you just repeat any of what you told me off there?
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  Yeah, I wouldn't really want to go into too much detail about Tommy's personal family. You know, it's very, very separate, but obviously it's a really, really tough situation.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  The last time they did this, the last time the tyrannical government decided to pull him away and take him away and harass him.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  You know, his children were very, very young and they didn't even realize that what was really sort of going on.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  And now that they're at an age where they're sort of trying to be able to comprehend this, it's even more sort of traumatic. It's even more difficult.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  It's a lot more pressure for his wife and it's really, really sort of heartbreaking seeing her go through all this.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:26.000]  Obviously, she's still keeping positive, focused on the legal process. There's still a huge amount of donations which are coming in, which are going to be supporting that.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000]  And that's giving her hope. But internally, it's a huge, huge burden to deal with.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:38.000]  This is probably the most difficult time now compared to all the other ones that have sort of happened in the past.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  And that's because most people that criticize Islam that are activists that get put in prison either get killed or close to killed.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  Well, look what happened with the man who threw the bacon sandwich outside of Moscow who left one there and he died in prison.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  You know, murdered in prison. We have cases like that up and down the country. Really, really scary.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  A lot of these judges and a lot of our politicians know that if you jail somebody for criticizing Islam, you're not just putting them away for a few months.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  You're giving them a life sentence. You're actually giving them the death sentence.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  It's how you can sweep people away and get rid of them.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  And it's obviously a major, major worry. We've already, obviously not acknowledged yesterday that if something like that ever happened,
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  that this country would completely erupt. It would probably be turned to rebel.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  People wouldn't take it. They absolutely wouldn't. It would be completely catastrophic.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000]  And I hope they do realize that. But yeah, it's extremely worrying.
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  Amazing, my friend. You have been there when the Antifa attacks you guys, 10 to 1.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  You have been there through the demonization of lies just a minute or two on what it's like your last year and a half with Tommy Robinson on the front lines of the Islamic invasion.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  Well, it's been a roller coaster. It was, it was absolutely intense. I didn't, the support has been completely unreal.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  When I first met Tommy, I didn't really, I thought he was sort of the most hated man in Britain.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000]  I thought it was only a couple of thousand people that might actually be supporting him given by the fact I only knew what was going on about him from the press,
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  which would have you believe that. But it was, it was absolutely incredible going up and down and seeing people shake his hand from universities,
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  from upper class, middle class, working class neighborhoods. It was, it was, it was really, really overwhelming.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  But obviously, incredibly stressful as well. There's, you know, video footage of us getting into Muslim no-go zones up and down the UK,
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  where we went to go to a Muslim MP's house who had defended a grooming gang and then loads of, loads of Muslim men in cars kind of drove around and bumped into our car
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  and smashed all the windows. There was obviously extreme violence we witnessed and all of our, my worst fears about the UK have been confirmed in those sort of
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  eight months of, of working with him. But we didn't, we just didn't expect this to happen. We didn't expect this to ever happen again.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  It seems to, we kind of thought there might even be a bit more of an immunity now because of the incident, because of his massive profile.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.000]  He's gone from sort of here to right, right to the top. And we thought it wouldn't, you know, it would never, ever happen again.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  But yeah, it's been very, very overwhelming. But also, it's actually been, excluding this case, quite a, quite a positive thing.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  Seeing, seeing how incredible, how, how all the incredible projects he's been doing has been sort of waking the country up.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  It's just such a shame what's happened recently. But when he does get out, and we believe that we can fight this and do that,
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  he's not going to be deterred. Speaking to him earlier on today, he's still standing strong. He's still standing positive.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  And he's going to come out guns blazing as soon as it's done, going at 100 miles an hour, and going to carry on doing everything he was saying before.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  Amazing. All right. Well, we'll be talking to you today, tomorrow, checking in. I know Harrison Smith is going to be hooking up with you very, very soon.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  He and the camera lady he's with. So again, thank you so much. We really appreciate what you're doing. Again, that is Kailin with a C.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  Kailin Robb on Twitter. Everybody should follow you there as well. That's Kailin Robb. One word. Kailin Robb. There it is on screen for TV viewers.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  This has been a major breaking news on the ninth protest that Tommy's calling for from prison and even bigger news, the exclusive.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  Now that the notice has been raised on what happened in his sentencing, the judge saying you're giving 13 months, not for last time for this.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  I'm sending you to prison. So Kailin, thank you so much.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  Thanks for having me. There goes. There goes Kailin. Thank you. Godspeed and be safe. Wow. This this has really caught the world's eye.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  Demonstrations all over Australia, now in the U.S. in Germany. Wilders. Wilders coming out saying this is tyranny going to the British Embassy at the Hague.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  German members of parliament going public offering him asylum.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  This is Chinese Communist level control in the U.K. and joining us for this segment, the next segment and part of the next.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  We played a statement earlier from a few days ago is Godfrey Bloom, military historian, former fiery member of the EU parliament who helped get Brexit through.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  Now that we know more about Tommy, because there was a news blackout, now that you've had a chance to look at this, what do you make of it, Mr. Bloom?
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  Well, this, of course, we need to go back. We're talking about, you know, the last few days, but we actually need to go back to the administration of Tony Blair in 1997.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  This is when the constitution, the British Constitution was allowed deliberately to deteriorate.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  So this kind of behavior by government, they could get away with this.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  So what they did, they destroyed the House of Lords, they reformed the House of Lords to pack it with their own people, with their own Lords who were people who were put there by Tony Blair because they were political cronies.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  So they're the people there. So we have a House of Lords, which is corrupted. So we have a law which is corrupted.
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  We have a judiciary, which is now part of the political system. We have a crown prosecution service, which was politicized by Tony Blair.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  And the prosecution service was taken away from the police, where the police would prosecute somebody if they felt it was right.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  But with the hands of the crown prosecution service, which is a political entity now. So this is, they were laying the ground for being able to make a political arrest, which of course is going completely against our constitution.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  They've now established commasars, and I remember at the time covering the constitutional change and people worrying this would happen.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:44.000]  It has now happened, but now there's pushback. And you know of many other political prisoners, not just Tommy Robinson that we'll talk about with God and Free Bloom, journalist, historian, or a member of the EU Parliament and one of the main engineers of the Brexit can follow him at Twitter.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  We have that on screen for everybody that would like to be able to follow him. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com. Please stay with us.

[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  Boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  But they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae. And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.

[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:42.000]  This is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  Yeah, putting on our little fight against the globalist, but they now recognize that so they pulled out all the stops and are trying to shut down infowars. They have had the FBI talk with 13 people, including army officers, you name it.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  The questioning now centers around a U.S. coup to steal the election from Hillary. They're now breaking away from Russia and they're trying to claim that I am at the center of it.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  That's how insane this has got. This is a conspiracy of wanting freedom and being open about it and promoting it.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  So in Europe, in England and all over, they're adopting Chinese style oppression, secret police, commasars, political crimes.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  We're going to break big news later in the broadcast about Starbucks and what's behind all this stuff. This is the plan. That's why England is so important. The Magna Carta and then everything we have here grew in common law out of that.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.000]  They had parliamentary votes for most. The British were for us not being able to be under the crown because it was being oppressive.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  Then the king came and addressed parliament. They voted for the war. They think of England as the enemy when we came from England.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  And now that basic system has fallen to classical tyranny. A decade after they predicted it would happen, or 16, 17, 18 years after they predicted it, it's now unfolded.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  I guess it's already 20 years after. And so Godfrey Bloom is our guest historian, former member of the EU parliament.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  He was getting into the basics and now it's devolved. And this authoritarianism is merging nicely with Sharia law and political correctness.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  And this has really got people to wake up, though, these images and these demonstrations and not reporting on what's happened and all the other things.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  You were saying when you talked to the producer that that's going to break the dam towards people being aware of some of the other political prisoners, Mr. Bloom.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  Yes, indeed it is. Broadvision isn't the only one, of course. There's another major one over here.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  But she blew the whistle on sex abuse by senior members, politicians and policemen and so on and so forth in Nottingham.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  And as soon as she blew the whistle, she was hustled away. She's now in solitary confinement and sedated in Peterborough.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  All right, God.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  What she did was blow the whistle on these things.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  Godfrey, you're over in the UK. Your skype's a bit hiccuppy right now. Tell us the name of the lady again and start over.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  Melanie Shaw, who was a whistleblower on the on the problems that the sexual abuse case was a sexual abuse case in Nottingham.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  She blew the whistle on it. She was in a home, an orphan's home. She blew the whistle and now she's sedated in solitary confinement in Peterborough prison.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.000]  Well, I use the term commissar when you said political crimes, but that was their specialty in the old Soviet Union, wasn't it?
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  Drugging you?
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:53.000]  Wasn't that their specialty, Godfrey Blum, in the old Soviet Union, would be grabbing people and drugging them?
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  Well, yes, indeed it is. And it's unbelievable that we've got here, but of course, they've degraded. We have a Bill of Rights.
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  We have a Toleration Act. We have a parliamentary system. We have a Court of Appeal.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:10.000]  And 20 years ago, if Tommy Robinson was to appeal this, it would be granted immediately. There was no question about it.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:18.000]  This whole thing is a stitch up. It's totally against the fundamental principles of English law, which we've abandoned.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  But we've also abandoned teaching children about the principles of English law in school.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  This is how the state gets away with it. It's just the same in America.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  If you grow up a generation or now with a second generation who has no knowledge about the principles of English law, it's very easy to take it away from them.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  Let me give you an analogy if I may, Alex.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  Please.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  I found a gold watch in a drawer in your house, which you'd forgotten you had, and I stole it.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  It would be years before A, you realized it had gone, and B, who could possibly have stolen it? It would be impossible.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  So this is what they do. They make sure that people don't know what their historical rights are in law, and it makes them easier to take away.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  And of course, what you get then is a very frustrated populace, which we have at the moment, who don't really understand what Tommy Robinson's done.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  They don't understand what Melanie Shaw has done and these other people.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  And as it comes out, people are now beginning to realize just how far down the path to a totalitarian state we've gone.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  Incredible. Yeah, there's the article. Child Abuse Witness held in Peterborough Prison drugged key whistleblower.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  Unbelievable. And I'm told that's why they're coming after me is exposing the pedophilia.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  And I've been told if I don't shut up, if I don't stop funding investigators that I'm going to basically be executed.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000]  Whatever then, somebody's got to stand up for these children. It's not heroics. It's basic instinct.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  But as you said, English common law is the basis of our law here. It's being stolen there.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  It's being stolen here. We're just a few years, three or four or five years behind you in some areas already just as bad.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  And if you don't know you have a freedom, it can be stolen much easier.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  People are having their birthright stolen. And as a great teaching moment, they're teaching you.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  We can secretly arrest Tommy Robinson, put him in a prison and then order the media not to report on it.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  That is just incredible.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  Yes. And I think we don't know, do we? How many other people have been arrested that we don't know about?
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  Because they didn't have a political profile. And you can go right back.
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  I don't know whether you remember the shooting in Dunblane, the mass shooting in Dunblane.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  There was a massive inquiry into that about two decades ago.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  And that overturned a very big paedophile ring. And that was closed down. There'd been books on it.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  Why was it all closed down? The whole investigation was closed down.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.000]  And the whispers were some very senior government ministers were involved.
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  And of course, if you look at, I'm not allowed to speak about certain things here.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  But if you drill down on some of the things coming up, there's so many people involved in all this.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  That's right. There it is. A big political coverup. 1980s paedophile ring, Washington Post and UK Parliament.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  But that was the old Washington Post before Jeff Bezos bought it. You won't be hearing about that anymore.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  And historically, we saw this in Rome. We saw this in other areas.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  They would use paedophile rings to compromise and control people because pretty much every culture would not put up with buggering children.
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  And so really, this is the evil thing that welds all of these networks together. We know the EU has unbelievable giant paedophile schemes.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  Satanism, little kids in cages found dead in the Netherlands. I mean, this is this all comes out, but then gets shut down.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  And then here you are, you know, famous member EU Parliament, you name it.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:56.000]  And you can't even talk about it because they've put D notices in now on the citizens not to talk about it.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  That is incredible, Godfrey Blum.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  Yes. And of course, the mainstream media go along with it. The mainstream media go along with it.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  But what you've got to understand is that the BBC is a state broadcaster.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  The governor of the BBC, the trustees are all selected by government.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Channel 4 is a publicly owned company. You can't broadcast on Sky TV, for example, without a license.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  So all mainstream media is very tightly controlled by the government.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  And it begs the question, does it not? I was talking to a colleague about this earlier on today.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  There seems to be a disproportionate amount of paedophiles in the political system.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  And one wonders, does one not, whether politics actually attracts these weird people?
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  Most politicians to me, I don't know about you over there, but they all seem weird.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  They're weird people. They don't have any friends. They didn't play team sports when they were at college.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  They're all weird people. I think perhaps this predilection for children or kiddie fiddling, as we call it over here,
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  is perhaps in the political side.
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  When I come back, you're a well-known historian and obviously worked in parliament at the EU,
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  so you understand what's happening. I think people are attractive,
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  but then they set up organizations of compromise through intelligence agencies.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000]  Cheating on your wife isn't enough to compromise you now.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  Your wife, at modern times, might want to join in.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  So now it's got to be the kids to compromise people. It's not enough to be gay.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  And so it's a rite of passage from my research into many of these satanic corrupt networks
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  to do really bad things to become a made member of the gang.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000]  We'll talk to Godfrey Bloom for five more minutes when we come back.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  Godfreybloom.uk can also follow him on Twitter.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  We'll put that on screen. That's Goddard's Bloom at Goddard's Bloom on Twitter.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  Now, we are running free shipping on all of our best-selling items for the week of Memorial Day.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  Memorial Week sales right now, running throughout the week,
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  these are some of the biggest sales we've ever offered,
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  like the high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  Some of those are discounted 50%.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  We've got the super high-quality storable food, 50% off, and free shipping.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000]  That's huge on the food because a lot of the cost is the shipping.
[01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  So 50% off of the storable food and on the three months, six months, one month,
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  and the free shipping. That's huge.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  X2, the good halogen, 50% off with bio tricillinium, brain force, amazing Neutropic,
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  50% off with free shipping.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  I can't go over it all. It'll take 20 minutes to do.
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  These are big sales and they help you and your family get great products
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  while funding an institution in full wars that is under sustained attack
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  by these very child-fiddling networks.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000]  We are going on to the end no matter what happens.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  We've only begun to fight. Stay with us.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  Between debt crisis, natural disasters, or even simple power outages,
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  having a supply of storable meals is crucial.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000]  With InfoWars' life-select storable food,
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000]  you can make sure you and your family are ready for any emergency.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  With drinks, snacks, and meals in amounts ranging from 72 hours to a full year,
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000]  there's no better place to look for healthy, easy, and incredible meals,
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  including meals such as traveler's stew, homestyle potato soup,
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  and a variety of other meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000]  InfoWars' life-select storable food will help you eat comfortably in a time of need.
[01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000]  They even work great for camping.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000]  Simply pack a 72-hour kit to go and you have easy to cook
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  and transport food for you and your loved one's trip.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  Don't be caught surprised by an emergency.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  Make sure you're stocked up today with all the food you need
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  for an affordable price with InfoWars' life-select storable foods.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  The Slate magazine has a professor and others saying,
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.000]  go beyond censorship, brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com,
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000]  so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can bully their way in
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue
[01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  as a society that is critical to this fight.
[01:59:44.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  This is the syndicated radio broadcast.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000]  It turned into a TV broadcast 15 years ago.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  It's only 23 years and I've seen the whole world change.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  The globalists, the evil forces are on the run,
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  but their counter-strike is serious authoritarianism
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.000]  against anybody that sticks their head up too high
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000]  in an attempt to intimidate people.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  Godfrey Bloom, you were as a historian,
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  not just a former member of the EU parliament,
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  one of the leaders of Brexit, getting into the proclivity,
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000]  the high concentration in some of these elite circles
[02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  of pedophilia, and you heard me get into the fact that
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  for my sources, they're using it to compromise, folks.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000]  Even people that don't want to do it are told to get into it
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  or they're not in the club.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  What's your intel on that and other ways to turn the tide against this?
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000]  That's Godfrey Bloom.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  His Skype is usually good.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  We've had some real problems with it today,
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  but that's the beauty of Skype.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  It's like we're talking to somebody.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  How far away is England from Texas?
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  5,000, 6,000 miles?
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000]  So, Godfrey, you're back.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  What are they using the pedophiles for in government
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.000]  to compromise people?
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  Well, it's the one thing that an accusation of
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  that you can't bounce back from.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  If it does, if the cat gets out of the box,
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  as you rightly said, Alex,
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  if it's just straightforward embezzlement
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000]  or it's fraud or it's adultery,
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  anything goes in politics these days.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  But this is something you can't bounce back from.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  So, if it's pedophilia, it's very, very difficult to get out of.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:55.000]  So, it's a huge black male hole all over people.
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  But, of course, the other problem that we have
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  is that these blasphemy laws and the laws that all go with this
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  are only one-sided.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  And so, it's only one section of the community
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  that suffers from these sort of things.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  And it's the indigenous population.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  And this is what is making people so angry.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  You can criticize Christianity as much as you like.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000]  But if you criticize Islam, you go to prison.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  This isn't a blasphemy act that's equal.
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000]  This is a one-sided blasphemy act.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  And we got rid of the concept of blasphemy in 1688
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  with the Toleration Acts.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  We've gone back hundreds of years now
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  because the one side controlled the shots
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  in the same way one might argue,
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  that up until the Toleration Acts,
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  it was the other side in Northern Europe
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  with the Protestants who controlled it.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  And in Southern Europe, it was the Catholics who controlled it.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000]  But we have this quite extraordinary situation at the moment
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  where we've gone back to thought police.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  You know, if you have a bad thought,
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  somebody's only got to complain that they're offended.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  You criticize them for their sexual predilections
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000]  or their faith, their religious faith.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  Criticism means that you can get arrested for that.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  So that actually closes down free speech of any sort.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  And that's the whole basis for the British way of life.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  And indeed, the American way of life is free speech.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000]  And that's gone.
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  And I've been doing podcasts on this now for nearly six months.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000]  And I've been leading up to this.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  This is a natural, this Tommy Robinson thing
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  and this Melanie Shaw thing are a natural progression of this.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  Well said.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  But seeing demonstrations pop up all over the world
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  and seeing the anger, I think people are starting to wake up.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  I mean, you see the populism, the nationalism,
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  you see Italy about to explode.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  I mean, I really think that the globalists are in trouble.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  Again, Godfrey Bloom has been our guest.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  He's really a smart guy.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  I'm going to try to get him with a better internet connection
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  because I want him to be a contributor
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  and join us a lot more often because he really knows his stuff.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  Godfrey, I see your skype's back.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000]  We've got about 30 seconds.
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000]  It's a great pleasure.
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  Sorry about the connection.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  Don't know quite why.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000]  It's been perfect over the last few weeks.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  Well, we'll see what's going on.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  God bless you.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  You did a great job.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  Really, really, really amazing points.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000]  Thank you.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  Again, folks, we're going to come back now
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  and get into the left's coordinated attack worldwide
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  in free speech and how once that goes, everything else goes.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  So they've been attacking the Second Amendment with lawsuits.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  Now they're attacking the First Amendment with them.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  And we need Congress.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000]  We need the president to move with laws to shield
[02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  the First Amendment in this country.
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  We need to break up the big tech giants
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  that are the heart of this anti-American activity.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  with prebiotic fiber by InfoWarsLife.

[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  and support overall digestive health

[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients,

[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  only at the beginning of the colon,
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.000]  but our premium organic acacia fiber
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  throughout the entire colon
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  for maximum prebiotic effect.

[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000]  or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000]  Tommy Robinson, frequent guest of this show,
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000]  has been disappeared
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000]  given 13-month sentence in one hour,
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  and there's a national ban on talking about it,
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  and I've talked to scores of reporters and others
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  who are afraid to even come on air.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:25.000]  Fox News then talked to his lawyer
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  who said, I can't tell you, I'll be arrested.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000]  What was Tommy Robinson reporting on?
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  Giant confirmed child kidnapping rings nationwide.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:39.000]  Now, you're watching on some TV, you can see this.
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  DrudgeReport.com.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  Look, he's got articles about Tommy Robinson,
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  activists Tommy Robinson arrested outside UK court,
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  jailed for 13 months on the same day.
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  Third link, judge orders media blackout.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  Boom, Fox News.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  Fox News, folks.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  Something has gone wrong.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  It seems you clicked on a bad link
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  and stumbled upon a 404 error.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  But when you see somebody like Tommy Robinson
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  who 11 years ago was the first person to expose
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  Muslim, grooming, and mass sex-travelling range.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000]  Yeah, this was basically the story of how
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.000]  political dissidents who made commit thought crime
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000]  are now being kidnapped off the streets of Britain.
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  There was an individual who was quite prominent
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  in the anti-Islamic extremism movement
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  who was going to attend a draw-mohammed cartoon contest last week
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  that police re-arrested him for a previous charge
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  that had already been released for
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  in order to prevent him from attending this conference,
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000]  literally just so he wouldn't offend Muslims.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000]  So that's the story.
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  We've done a report on that outside Big Ben.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  That's a massive story.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  It's going to be up tomorrow before the show.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  Here have been slave caravans and slave women
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  and slave children being sold
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  for 6,000-plus years of recorded history
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.000]  in North Africa, in the Middle East,
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  and in Central Asia.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000]  By the way, there are other cultures
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.000]  as well. It's just those cultures never came up
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  to the 21st century.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000]  So I have a whole stack of mainstream British news
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000]  after 11 years of them covering it up,
[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000]  having to admit that indeed every major town
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000]  has thousands of little girls and some boys
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  trained, recruited, and then put into sex slavery
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  by age 9, 10, 11.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  And if the parents, the poor parents, get up and say,
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  no, the police come and set them up and arrest them
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  and have CPS, Child Protective Services, take their children.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  They're now having parliamentary hearings on this
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.000]  so they could cover it up for decades
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  but because of Tommy Robinson breaking the ice,
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000]  blowing a hole in the lie,
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  being put in prison for a year five years ago
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  over this, and not shutting up,
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000]  others had the courage to go public.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  So the pedophile rings that run England,
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  that's mainstream news, are really angry.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000]  So now they've ordered in the courts
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  that no one report on the trials, period.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000]  Don't even say they exist.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000]  And so Tommy Robinson was arrested on Friday.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000]  He already had a suspended sentence from last year
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000]  after serving three months in prison.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  He had 13 months of it suspended
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  as long as he, quote, wouldn't go into trials
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000]  and cover them live, which he'd done before.
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  Like, press should be able to do until a few years ago
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  anywhere in the Western world.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  That protects pedophilia.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000]  You can go to any other trial you want.
[02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  So he just went outside one.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  I watched the whole live stream after it was archived
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  and just said they're having a grooming trial here.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000]  Didn't say the details, any of that.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000]  Now this is all confirmed.
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000]  We reported on it Friday and Saturday.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  Fox News has a big article that details it.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000]  It's up on infowars.com
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  because they removed the Fox News article.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  It just disappeared.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000]  Not corrected.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  The one that Drugs is linked to, it's just gone.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  Fox News confirms Tommy Robinson
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  sentenced to 13 months
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  for reporting on pedophile grooming trial.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  Here's the Fox News article that's been deleted.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  The link that Drugs is linked to has been deleted.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000]  Right wing activist Tommy Robinson
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  reportedly jailed after filming
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  outside child grooming trial.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  This is Fox News confirming everything we already told you.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  But it says it's shocking.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  His lawyer isn't allowed to talk to us.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  He says this is a police state.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  My own listeners yesterday afternoon
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  I was shooting live reports.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000]  They were like, Alex, there's not a ban
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  on reporting on Tommy Robinson.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  And they started commenting and the feed's going,
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  oh, we apologize, there is.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000]  Oh my god, you can do that in England?
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.000]  Yeah.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  We are drugged out.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  We are following other people's opinions.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000]  We are controlled by the media.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]  Today it all changes.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000]  It is a choice.
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000]  Just like what I said, slavery is a choice.
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000]  Einstein says the depth of insanity
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  So we keep on saying, I hate you.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  I hate you.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  You fuck you.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000]  You fuck you.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000]  to change something.
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  Now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000]  They say Trump's crazy.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000]  They say I'm crazy.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  But I'm here to show love.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000]  It's a bigger plan.
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  And I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  All right, Mark Rondaz, it joins us for the balance of the hour.
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  Let's get a little bit into the next ahead of David Knight
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  and our key reporting from the EU and from Europe
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000]  on what's happening.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:14.000]  We're also going to have another corporate lawyer in here,
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  Mr. Nixon, to break down a bunch of different angles
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  that are taking place and unfolding as well.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  Now, Mark Rondaz is one of the top First Amendment lawyers
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  in the country.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  And he's also known for taking on basically anybody's case
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  to defend the First Amendment.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  But we are now in a climate, not just here, but all the world,
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  where communist Chinese-style standards are being adopted.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  We were just talking here in the break.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  You were already going to come here a week ago.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000]  But now it's the perfect time with Tommy Robinson,
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  who isn't even a racist and who is exposing the fact that you
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  can't even report on child kidnapping rings that are confirmed
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  when he's the first guy to expose them.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000]  He was put in prison for it.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  I just had a former member of the EU Parliament
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  on talking about all the political prisoners.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000]  They're grabbing women that expose pedophilia and putting them
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  in prison.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  I mean, Europe and the UK is just crazy.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000]  Well, they don't have the same safeguards for freedom
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000]  of expression that we do.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.000]  So in the UK, I saw a little bit of the order.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.000]  And it says that in the interest of justice and making sure
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  there's a fair trial, that there should be no reporting
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000]  on the trial.
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000]  Now, that's pretty unusual even in the UK.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000]  But you can even do that here.
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  Here, we do have the First Amendment
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.000]  balanced against the Sixth Amendment.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  But it's a really heavy burden because in a democratic society,
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  you can't have fair courts.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000]  You can't have a fair trial.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  You can't have a fair justice system unless, you know,
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  as a judge I was before in Nevada one time said,
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  in a case, you know, the best way to show the people
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:48.000]  that your court system is fair and just is to tell them,
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  come and see for yourself.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000]  Well, when we can't come and see for ourselves,
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  it certainly raises-
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  But they've expanded it past that with these D notices where
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000]  they said, don't even report on Tommy Robinson's arrest.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  And don't even report that there is a child grooming
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000]  pedophile ring hearing.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000]  Well, that's not inside reporting on the names of the kids
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  or anything.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000]  I can see a judge saying, don't report the names of the kids.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  But they're not doing that.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  He's just outside saying, see, I told you that town had that
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.000]  going on.
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000]  Boom.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  Yeah, I mean, look, as far as the facts that he's reported,
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  I don't know anything about them.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000]  And, you know, I can't speak to them.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  But what I can say is it troubles me when what is supposed
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  to be a democratic country shuts down reporting on anything
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  that's a matter of public interest.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000]  By the way, it was overturned because major papers reported it.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.000]  We just had the exclusive on earlier with the man that was
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000]  there in the court when the judge did it.
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000]  And now it's been overturned today.
[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  Has it?
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  He was able to talk about what the judge did.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  The judge said, I'm not putting you in jail for violating
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  the last gag order.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000]  I'm putting you in jail for 13 months for what you did today.
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000]  Getting outside the courthouse saying there is a Muslim
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:52.000]  grooming gang trial happening inside.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  Well, I mean, to go to jail for making a statement like that
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000]  seems excessive to me.
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  I mean, if it's defamatory, then let somebody bring a civil case.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  But to put someone in prison for something like that just seems
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  troubling to me.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000]  But, you know, this is not just something that we got to look
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  across the ocean at as a problem.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  You know, here in the U.S., I'm finding more and more cases
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:17.000]  getting sealed by judges when certain powerful litigants want
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.000]  them to.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000]  You know, for example, there's a case I'm, I can't talk too
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000]  in too much detail on it because I'm working on it.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.000]  But Giffrey versus Maxwell is taking place up in the southern
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000]  district of New York.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  And in that case, the entire case has been sealed for the most
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000]  part.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000]  And that's because the judge hasn't really articulated much
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  where before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  DeMore versus Google, James DeMore, the dissident from Google.
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  I mean, their Google's lawyers have moved to seal that case.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  And the complaint in that case is now no longer a matter of...
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.000]  By the way, we know why.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  They make them worship people as dragons and as golden buildings.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000]  It's totally nuts.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  We call it the crapper, water closet, outhouse or bathroom.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  But where do you go when there's nowhere to go?
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  The answer is the Biffy Bag.
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  The Biffy Bag is a pocket-sized disposable toilet that fits in
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  your glove box, tackle box, toolbox, backpack or purse.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  The Biffy Bag has everything you need for a sanitary
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000]  and comfortable relief experience.
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000]  It's ready to use in just seconds.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  And just toss it in the trash when you're done.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000]  It's your Biffy in a Jiffy.
[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  BiffyBag.com.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:18:04.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:56.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000]  You're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000]  And I'm 32 now.
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.000]  I remember back when Info Wars and Prison Planet,
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000]  it was just blue text on a white screen
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  And I thought it was pretty cool.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  And read all the books and seen all the DVDs
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000]  and followed all your guests.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.000]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000]  of Survival Shield.
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality,
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Michael ZX Body.
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000]  It's all amazing.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.000]  Thank you, brother.
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind,
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000]  you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000]  And it's just the more you know God,
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000]  with you, the crew, and the listeners out there.
[02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.000]  1776 World War.
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  Welcome back.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  I'm Alex Jones, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  There is so much going on.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000]  It is such an insane time to be alive.
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000]  We're with Mark Rondaza of rondazagroup.com.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  I knew he was a top First Amendment lawyer,
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000]  but then I was talking to one of my lawyers.
[02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.000]  One of the top guys.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000]  So it's great to have him here in town.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  He's always flying back and forth across the country,
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  has offices in a whole bunch of states.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000]  And so we're blessed to have him here.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:02.000]  Let's get into Roseanne on the First Amendment.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.000]  So much here.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.000]  Roseanne canceled the ABC following racist tweet.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  Maybe it's the show already started to sink.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000]  Roseanne Barr goes on wild racist tweet storm
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.000]  about Clintons, George Soros, and others.
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:16.000]  Then I read her tweets.
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  I didn't really see anything racist in there.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  It's about George Soros and people.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.000]  But hey, ABC.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.000]  She works for them.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  It's their contract.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  They're allowed to do it.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000]  Just like the NFL.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  You've, you know, you're viewing that.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  Yeah.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000]  I mean, look, you know, I saw some of her tweets.
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  It looked like she was comparing some black women
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  to apes, which is...
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.000]  Oh, I didn't see that.
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  Yeah.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  I mean, I saw that on Twitter.
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:39.000]  I don't know if they were doctored or what,
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  but in any event, it doesn't matter.
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000]  Yes.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:45.000]  The ABC can get rid of her for whatever reason they want.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:46.000]  They don't like what speech she makes.
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.000]  They can do that.
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000]  And yes, it is the same as the NFL.
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:52.000]  The NFL has every right to tell these players
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  that they can't protest.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000]  But I think in both situations, just because they can
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000]  doesn't necessarily mean they should.
[02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:02.000]  You know, free speech is a different thing
[02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  than the First Amendment, right?
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000]  The First Amendment protects your right to free speech
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000]  from interference by the government.
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  Free speech is larger than that.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.000]  But, you know, as Americans, I think there ought to be
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:17.000]  a higher regard for freedom of expression.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  There should be more latitude for it.
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000]  It shouldn't be a minefield that if Roseanne steps on it
[02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  with a stupid tweet, that means the end of some show
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  because this network has to be so clear to make sure
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  that it signals to everybody how virtuous it is.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  You know, just like on the opposite end
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000]  of the political spectrum, the NFL feels like it has
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:39.000]  to, like, make this patriotic move, which I think
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  is the least patriotic thing that the NFL could do.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  You know, the NFL is, to me, represents America
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  about as much as Bruce Springsteen and, you know,
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.000]  big V8 engines.
[02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:54.000]  But then you've got them really just taking a dump
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  on these players' free speech rights, and I think
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000]  that there's enough room in the NFL and there's enough
[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  room on ABC to tolerate these players' speech
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  and there's enough room to tolerate Roseanne's speech
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  because what we have is this narrowing of what is tolerated.
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  But if it's a corporation and it's a company,
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000]  you can have rules. I mean, I agree that it's a slippery slope,
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  but look, we're going to break news later today
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:20.000]  that exclusively, that, and we already knew this,
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:23.000]  but that you've got the government and the leftist
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  and some big organizations working with Starbucks
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  to have all this race training stuff
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  and asking patrons of their races
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000]  to create racial division and hysteria
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000]  and that this is the psychological control
[02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000]  that some very wicked corporations are involved in
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  pushing this whole anti-free speech agenda.
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000]  So I totally agree with you that it's ominous,
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000]  it's dangerous, it's bad, but we have the proof
[02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  of major think tanks and psych warfare groups
[02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  we're going to break later today.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000]  As soon as the report's done, let me know, guys.
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  I mean, this is diabolical.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000]  Look, I don't know anything about any of that,
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000]  but I can tell you that it is, to me,
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  the amount of divisiveness that we seem to be trying to create.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000]  It's as if, you know, the two guys who got thrown
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000]  out of Starbucks, it was wrong.
[02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.000]  I think what happened to them was bad,
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  but they seem to have a lot of class about it.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  You know, they settled that case for $1
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  and I thought that sent the right message.
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  You know, and now Starbucks has this reeducation camp
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  here for everybody where they're shutting down
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  for a whole day with their private company.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  They can do that.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  Frankly, though, I don't know that it's really constructive,
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:36.000]  but that's their right. That's a great way to put it.
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  Starbucks is becoming a giant reeducation camp.
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000]  The schools are.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  This is a classic Soviet-style reeducation camp.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  That's what the sensitivity training is.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000]  And it's funny you say that because we have the documents.
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  We're putting together right now.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.000]  I could have just brought it out on air,
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  but they're doing a special report right now
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  where it's premeditated to create more division
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  and create a cultural crisis.
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  Look, if that's the case, it would make perfect sense.
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.000]  I mean, it's a good idea if you have people,
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  if you're at the top of a pyramid,
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  what you want is the people at the bottom of the pyramid
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000]  fighting with each other over crumbs.
[02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  So it would make perfect sense.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  But, you know, but back to the real free speech issue here
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  is that we need a societal commitment to it.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  And that means we need more tolerance for it,
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000]  both from the right and the left.
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  You know, it's like we've seen a lot of it
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  from the left recently,
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  but I think we're seeing just as bad from the right.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  When you see people cheering this NFL policy,
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000]  you know, these are the same people that we've relied on
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000]  for the past few years.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  No, I thought that the other day.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000]  I mean, I agree they have the right to do it as a corporation,
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  but I made the point now we got the right wing coming in
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  and attacking speech and the left wing,
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000]  but there'll be nothing left when they're done.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  And that's the problem.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000]  You know, we're all just dividing into tribes
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  instead of having free speech being our tribe
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  and then saying we can differ on policy.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000]  We can differ on race theories.
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  We can differ on gender theories.
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  But see how they segue it in is like
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  saying video game makers are causing mass shootings.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  No, some mentally ill people on Prozac type drugs
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  tend to be influenced by them,
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  but that's like saying somebody runs somebody over with a truck
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  because they're crazy.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  So it's the truck's fault.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000]  You know, with myself and others,
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  the new thing is Jones set someone into the pizzeria.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  Totally not true.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  Then they say someone killed someone in the pizzeria.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  Then they say Jones sent some woman that,
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000]  by the way, doesn't even like me
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  and some guy to some woman's door in Connecticut
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  to be mean to people saying their kids didn't die
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  when I never said that, never named those people.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  So the way they're extending to get free speech
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  is claiming that it's causing violence like fire in a theater.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  And then they extend it further,
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  claiming that then it's this distress that I'm putting them under
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  because of what crazy people did that I have no connection to.
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  Yeah, look, there's always been this argument.
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000]  You know, back to the 50s
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  when people tried to claim comic books
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000]  were causing kids to be mentally ill.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  You know, when I was a kid,
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:54.000]  they were saying that Ozzy Osbourne was causing it
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  or that heavy metal music was causing it
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  or kids playing Dungeons & Dragons
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.000]  and now it's racist speech
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.000]  or now it's extremist speech of some kind
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  and they'll define that
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  and the ever-expanding definition of racism or extremist
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  which will fit just pretty much anything
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  that they want to suppress.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.000]  At the end of the day,
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  you got to look at these arguments for what they are.
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  It's the same warmed over garbage.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000]  You know, when they said that pornography
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000]  was causing rape, for example.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  The science showed that in Denmark
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  when pornography became legalized,
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000]  it dropped the sexual assault rate.
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  Uh-oh, what now?
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.000]  You have this constant assault
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  on what is easy to get rid of.
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  It makes it really easy.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  When you can point at some content and say,
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  I don't like that content and I think that's causing it.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  Exactly, and then they set the precedent.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.000]  They first build a straw man of who I am
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  and you can take stuff out of context
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  and then they demonize that and we looked it up.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  Do you know how many articles they've put out
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  the last two years on me on Sandy Hook?
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.000]  I do not.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  It's in the hundreds of thousands.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000]  Because they'll put one out and it's syndicated everywhere.
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000]  This is like propaganda you put out
[02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  before you invade a country.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  Sure.
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000]  And now they admit in the Wall Street Journal
[02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  the plan is when they take me down in WikiLeaks,
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000]  they are planning, they said,
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  to end the free web as they know it.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  This is public.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  I can show you the article.
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  You're one of the few media personalities
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  who isn't beholden to one of these large companies.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000]  So I could see why that would be troubling to them.
[02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000]  I mean, I can see why some people might not like your views,
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  but what's wrong with letting them be out there
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  and combating them with your own?
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  I mean, they had A.R. America.
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  It didn't work out that well.
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  I mean, people just didn't want to listen to it.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  Sorry.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  When sometimes there's ideas out there
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  that I like but the marketplace rejects them,
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  I have to just sit back and look at it like a game
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  where my team didn't...
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  That's right. Stay right there, Mr. Andazza,
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  our great first woman lawyer.
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  When we come back to more on Roseanne,
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  because I guess some of these are insensitive tweets.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:29:21.000]  I hadn't read them all. We'll be right back.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:27.000]  You have been lied to.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000]  My name is Kevin Ship.
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  Finally, someone has come out and written
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000]  and our government is now being run and ruled
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  by a shadow government.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks,
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  doesn't mean other people are.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library,
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  to give them a church.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  Get them right now at KillingUncleSanBuck.com.

[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000]  InfowarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.000]  in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:04.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way
[02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000]  to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:10.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:13.000]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.000]  that people who ate certain quail eggs
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000]  experienced less seasonal immune
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000]  and inflammatory responses.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:29.000]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000]  In fact, current research has found
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.000]  that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000]  and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:51.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000]  Winner's Sun is the result of our pursuit
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000]  of the best source of Vitamin D3.
[02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000]  The research and development took over two years,
[02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:33.000]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,
[02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:36.000]  is the best vegan Vitamin D3 product in the world.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.000]  Read the facts at infowarslife.com
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:42.000]  about Winner's Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.000]  Not only does Vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood,
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  but Vitamin D supports our memory and brain function,
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000]  something the globalists are targeting.

[02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created
[02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000]  a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000]  and joint support.
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000]  of turmeric available.
[02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years
[02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000]  and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000]  It is well known in traditional medicine
[02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000]  for its soothing properties.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000]  makes for optimal absorption to help boost
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:26.000]  and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function,
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  immune system, and so much more.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  Regular turmeric root from the store
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:33.000]  only contains 1-5% of active ingredients,
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  but our turmeric root extract contains
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:38.000]  over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:41.000]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs
[02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.000]  such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:47.000]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  Mark Rundazen,
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000]  one of the top First Amendment lawyers
[02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000]  here in the studio with us getting into the
[02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000]  what would you call it, all-out, systematic,
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:40.000]  corporate, university, private assault on free speech
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  where we're being inducted into this
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000]  neurotic, politically correct,
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000]  virtue signaling hellhole.
[02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000]  And then you read the WikiLeaks,
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000]  and you see these, but it talks about
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  we need more culture war to keep control of the masses.
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000]  What you said earlier about the pyramid,
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  and it makes sense that that's what they've always done
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:59.000]  in other third world countries and in ancient feudal nations.
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:02.000]  Well, every society, and it is a cultural issue.
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  It's not just the legal issues, not just the corporations.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  It needs to be those of us that are just regular people
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000]  have got to start reaffirming a commitment
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:14.000]  to freedom of expression or we're going to lose it.
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000]  And you're going to turn around one day,
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  for example, the ACLU championed hate speech laws for years.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  And now they are completely losing their mind
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000]  because hate speech laws are being used now
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:29.000]  to protect police officers from hate speech.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  And it's like surprise, you know,
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000]  you thought that the cheetah wouldn't claw your face
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  when you let it out of the cage, that's what happened.
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  So we have this cultural problem, and yes,
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  it's been bubbling up for years.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  I mean, I remember when I started college,
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  I mean, I had a poster on my wall on my door,
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  on my dorm room that had the Nazi swastika
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000]  with the red circle around it with the line through it.
[02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000]  It was from a Dead Kennedys album.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  I was kind of a punk rock kid back then.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000]  Still am, just changed my hair a bit.
[02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000]  But, you know, I got written up
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000]  for having an anti-Semitic display.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.000]  I know, it's incredible. Exactly.
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000]  And I said, do you not recognize the big red circle
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  and the big red slash through it?
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  That means the exact opposite of what you're charging.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000]  But the virtue signalers are so wanting to find it
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000]  because it's their whole cosmology, their whole world.
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  That's why they've reported like 99% of the dorm rooms,
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000]  swastikas and all the rest of it are staged,
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  self-inflicted for attention.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  Yeah, I mean, there have been...
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000]  They can't ever hardly find real ones.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000]  No, I mean, we have a mutual friend, Mike Sarnovich,
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000]  who's putting out a film right now called Hoaxed,
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.000]  which has documented hundreds of cases of this.
[02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  You know, it's as if, you know, there is this...
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  If something like this does happen to you, it's terrible.
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.000]  And it immediately gives you a platform.
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  It immediately gives you some moral authority.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000]  So it's not surprising that there is an allure
[02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  to somebody hoaxing themselves in a, you know,
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  hoaxing everybody that they've been involved
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000]  in an incident like this.
[02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  Well, that's like the statistic showing in the U.S.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000]  about half of rape claims are completely fake.
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  There are real rape going on. It's terrible.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000]  I've got three dollars. Somebody rapes one of my daughters.
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000]  They're dead. I'm not saying rape doesn't happen,
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  but then take Morgan Friedman. He's talking about Sue and CNN
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000]  because they admit this was women.
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  He's hitting on them. It's a little creepy a couple times,
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  a little over the top, but at the same time,
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000]  the women are laughing everything. That's not harassment.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000]  That's not assault.
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000]  That's not women on TV shaking their heads
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  and losing endorsements.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  It's just piling on.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  And then that takes away from Harvey Weinstein
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  and, you know, the clear evidence that where their smokers fire,
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  it looks like hundreds of women
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000]  and really serious stuff.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000]  Well, have you seen that video of Morgan Friedman?
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.000]  I mean, he's sitting there next to, I think it's Michael Cain,
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.000]  who says to a woman who was six months pregnant,
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  I'm sorry, I wasn't, I didn't congratulate you
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000]  because one time I congratulated a woman
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  on being six months pregnant and she wasn't,
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  and, oh boy, was I embarrassed and I'll never do that again.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  And Morgan Friedman says, I wish I was there.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  Because it'd be funny. Right.
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  He's not talking about being there when she was pregnant.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  No, I mean, I don't see how anybody could interpret it that way,
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000]  but this woman was so desperate to be offended
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:15.000]  because, you know, offense and victimization
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000]  is the coin of the realm now.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:20.000]  So even though it doesn't really do anything for most people,
[02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  and then once they do it, once they file the fake EEOC complaint,
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.000]  once they do that, then they don't get hired
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000]  because they blackballed themselves, not the other people.
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000]  They don't understand it.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  Yeah, back this up.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000]  We're going to play the EEOC offensive clip in a minute.
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  This is them talking about going in style
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  and then the women all sit up, they're all angry.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  We're CNN.
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000]  They might have one report every six months
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  about thousands of women sold to sex slavery
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  every month out of Sub-Saharan Africa
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000]  by Arab slave traders in cages.
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  The Arab slave trade is back
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  and there is zero coverage in the New York Times,
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.000]  Washington Post, but then there's women shaking their heads
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.000]  about Morgan Friedman here. Let's play the clip.
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  I congratulate the woman.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000]  I'm very pregnant and she wasn't.
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000]  So I've never done it again.
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  For 50 years I've never done it.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  You've learned your lesson.
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  I learned my lesson.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000]  I wish I was there.
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000]  This movie is...
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  And the women look like they've seen the ultimate criminal here.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  Well, my favorite part of that clip
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  is actually when you show the two women.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  I don't know if I'm just interpreting the woman
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  on the left's view,
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  but the woman on the left here seems to be looking at her co-host.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  She looks at her at one point like,
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000]  this is what you brought me on for?
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  Wait, I don't know.
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  That looked to me right there.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000]  If I can read her, she's like, you've got to be kidding me.
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000]  How do I keep a straight face?
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000]  Although who knows?
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  Maybe she's sitting there saying, me too, a sister.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  But it's just...
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  There are close to a million people killed
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000]  in the Arab Spring that Hillary and Obama funded.
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000]  They took out moderate people
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  who made deals with us,
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000]  who they betrayed in deals,
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000]  who murdered them,
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  and then under the Islamic caliphate idea,
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000]  blacks aren't fully human.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000]  They're the ones that started the modern slave trade.
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000]  Even Al Jazeera admits
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  tens of thousands of women a month
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000]  are being sold in slave auctions.
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000]  Almost no coverage.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000]  Where are these women shaking their heads about that?
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  It really makes me mad, Mark.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000]  Well, you might wind up
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  in a politically incorrect quagmire
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  if you start criticizing that.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  It's much easier to go pick somebody here
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000]  who's a freeman.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000]  Why not pick on Harvey Weinstein?
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000]  Harvey Weinstein, he's a bad guy.
[02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000]  But his own driver and his own valet
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  and his own assistant said,
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000]  I think they're all probably have some culpability.
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  Oh yeah, he would pin women
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  every week in the car
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000]  and rape them.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000]  How do you drive a guy like that
[02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000]  and not pull the car over and say,
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000]  what the hell is wrong with you?
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  No job as a driver is a good enough job
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  to go through that.
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000]  What he was doing was getting less than a hundred pound of women.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  And then reportedly
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  this is what he would do is he would pin them
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000]  and then do that begging.
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  He'd heard the tapes and say, come on, it's okay.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  He'd start smothering them
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  and then they would just finally be smothered
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  and then he would cover their mouth up
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  and go, no, no, no, no.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  They would just let him.
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  Doesn't sound very fun.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  No, the fun of having sex with a woman
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  is convincing her to do it with you.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  She wants to do it.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  I mean, I don't know if it's just this kind of show,
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  but yes, that's the more fun way to do it.
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  Well, no, I mean, I just thought about that.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  Yeah, it's a family show at the same time.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  That's natural. Men and women.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  It's like James Constance.
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  I played the clip last week when you were on.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  They're like, that's not Morgan Freeman.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  He's like, isn't that what men and women have done
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  since the beginning of time? That's what mammals do.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  You know, they get together.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  It's this feminist radical idea that a man and woman
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  even initiating like, hey, you look good.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000]  No, it's not 10 amounts of rape and it's Hollywood
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  where they abuse women more than any other group
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000]  out there in my reading and my research
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000]  that is the ones pushing men against women.
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000]  What do you think is behind that?
[02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  Look, I heard a really good comedian.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000]  I wish I could remember her name,
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  but she said, you want to know how to keep
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  from getting accused of sexual harassment?
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  She said, be hot.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  I mean, I, you know,
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  look, if Harvey Weinstein was Brad Pitt,
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000]  I wonder how that all would have gone down.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  So, you know, I just
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  think that this, this is like a,
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  it's a hysteria
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  that unfortunately there is fire, okay?
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  It's not like where there's smoke,
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  there's fire and there isn't.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  But they keep equating rape.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  Yes. And really evil stuff
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  like Bill Cosby ended up
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  clearly doing with,
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  and Morgan Freeman did add saying
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000]  Trump's the secret communist
[02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  removing him from office.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  Morgan Freeman's a sellout.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  He's in way too many movies. I used to like him.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000]  Moving out, I'm like, God, it's the same.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  He plays God in every show.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000]  I like him. I get a kick out of
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  if God looks like Morgan Freeman.
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  But if, yeah.
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  No, but I think he's over-saturated.
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  It very much diminishes what,
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  you know, what the women went through under
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000]  Bill Cosby or, you know,
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000]  or Harvey Weinstein to then
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  kind of pull in a guy like Morgan Freeman
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000]  who say what you will about his views,
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  say what you will about his acting,
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  say what you will about his face.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  I happen to be a fan of his,
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  but, you know, there is nothing
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000]  I've seen that he's done that warrants
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  even the slightest bit of criticism.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  I mean, if anything,
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000]  he's certainly
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  as far left as you can get,
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000]  but they always want to eat their own
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  because there's this allure
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000]  in any movement.
[02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000]  When you can be cruel to somebody
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000]  and you can beat on somebody,
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  but do it from a position of virtue,
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  that is so alluring.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  I totally agree with you.
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  You know, Tuxley wrote about that.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  I'm going to say this though about Valerie Jarrett.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  It's not because she's part black or whatever.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  I think she looks like a snapping turtle
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000]  on PCP.
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:43:14.000]  You can make sure you and your family are ready for any emergency.
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  With drinks, snacks, and meals

[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000]  This late magazine has a professor and others
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  saying go beyond censorship,
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:27.000]  brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000]  so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.000]  or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter

[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  and so the censors can bully their way in
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  as a society that is critical to this fight.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:56.000]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.

[02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000]  It's the other equation in probiotics.

[02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:33.000]  It's a spray you do.
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:34.000]  You can also swallow it.

[02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:47.000]  and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake,
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000]  but it's other people that aren't awake
[02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000]  and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000]  Again, thank you so much for being part
[02:46:53.000 --> 02:47:15.000]  of the second American Revolution.
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:39.000]  Mark Rondaza of rondaza.com is here.
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  It's got nationwide legal First Amendment and boy,
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000]  like you said, when you went to Georgetown,
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  the very university suing me with the made up stuff
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  out of what happened and the whole crisis
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000]  and the deaths that happened last year
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000]  and all the things that went on in Charlottesville,
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000]  and you're saying,
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  but now you are in real demand.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  That little obscure area you got into
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  because there was no need to defend it.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:02.000]  It wasn't under attack.
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.000]  Now you've definitely hit pay dirt.
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  Well, there's always been a reason to have First Amendment lawyers.
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  Yes, but there were, I think when I first started doing it,
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.000]  there was a lot of questions like people would say,
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  well, what kind of lawyer are you?
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:17.000]  Let's say a First Amendment lawyer
[02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  and then I'd have to explain what that meant.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000]  I don't have to explain what that means so much anymore,
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  which in some ways that makes me happy,
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000]  that there's a little more awareness
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  of what the First Amendment is,
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  but unfortunately there seems to be a less of a commitment to it.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  At one time, and I say just in sort of,
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.000]  there's that Zen story about the guy,
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  the general who gets a horse and gets it to his son
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  and then his son breaks his leg.
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:48.000]  It's in a couple movies where it's every single piece of the story.
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  That sounds like Wilson's war.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:50.000]  That's it.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000]  Yeah, it sounds like it's a good thing that happens.
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  You see the different angles.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:54.000]  Right.
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:55.000]  Multidimensional chess.
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  Right.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.000]  And I remember when the Soviet Union fell
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  and Eastern Europe became free,
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  it looked like it was a great thing.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  And now we look back and I think maybe at least in America,
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.000]  I'm not sure because there was always this thing
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000]  that we could point across the Atlantic and say,
[02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.000]  over that wall, that's what we don't want to be.
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:17.000]  And now over here, it seems like
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.000]  we don't have the government so much shoving it down our throats
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000]  as we are just screaming for it.
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000]  We are begging for...
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  Well, it's corporatism.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.000]  Globalism is megacorporations acting as government.
[02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  And bigger than government, more powerful than government.
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:36.000]  I mean, look, if you tried to reign in Twitter and Facebook's censorship,
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  which, you know, they are allowed to do what they're doing
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  under the First Amendment, at least for now.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:44.000]  I mean, I'm hoping that there are some legal theories
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:47.000]  that percolate, that somehow reign them in.
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  But, you know, I recognize that the weight of the authority
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:51.000]  right now says they can do that.
[02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  Let me break this down.
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  I know this is organized because I've read
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:56.000]  what the IMF and World Bank have said.
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  I've seen the WikiLeaks.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  I've seen what Zuckerberg says on Hot Mike's.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  Matt Drudge came here.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:04.000]  He's only done one interview since about two and a half years ago.
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  No, about two years ago.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  And he stood right there because he wanted to be on camera
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  because of repercussions of people attacking him.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  And he said, I've met with the Supreme Court Justice a month ago,
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000]  the other conservative that's still alive,
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:16.000]  that was on the court then.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000]  And he said, I've been briefed.
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.000]  I mean, there is a U.N. Soros plan.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  And the Congress is going along with it,
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  both parties, because even Republican, you know,
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  media like Wall Street Journal doesn't like competition.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  News Corp behind the scenes is going along with all this.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  I like Sean Hannity.
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  I like, you know, Tucker Carlson.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  But they're not the guys running News Corp.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  The New Fox is going to be even worse.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  It's going to be only sports and media
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.000]  as they split off from Disney.
[02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000]  And they're coming after it.
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  And in those meetings,
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  they told the Supreme Court Justice,
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  you just have to go along with this.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  It's global.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000]  You better sign on.
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.000]  And the Supreme Court Justice said, no, I won't.
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000]  But just because Trump got in,
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  they're still going ahead with the plan, bro.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:00.000]  And so this is organized to come in
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:03.000]  and take somebody like me, set me up as the demon,
[02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  lie about what I've done, destroy me,
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:06.000]  and set the precedent.
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000]  So I'm not building myself up.
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  I'm not that important or powerful to have
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  over a hundred thousand articles about me
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:14.000]  just on the Sandy Hook,
[02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000]  misrepresenting what I said or did.
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000]  But they admit this is the case
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000]  to destroy the First Amendment.
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000]  And that's why they fired all the other torpedoes
[02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000]  and lied and said in Charlottesville
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000]  that I said some guy I never heard of
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000]  killed a woman.
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:28.000]  I didn't say that.
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000]  I said, Soros, funding the demonstrators,
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:31.000]  the police standing down,
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:34.000]  contributed to the atmosphere that got that woman killed.
[02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:35.000]  They don't care.
[02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:36.000]  Georgetown is funding it.
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000]  They're coming for me because it's organized.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000]  So how do we face something like that?
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000]  Look, have you ever had a client
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000]  where they had a hundred thousand articles
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000]  to destroy them on one subject?
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000]  Never had a client with a hundred thousand articles.
[02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.000]  No.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:50.000]  I can show you.
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.000]  One hundred thousand.
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:52.000]  Sure.
[02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000]  But the problem or more or more,
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:55.000]  I think what you're maybe pointing at
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  or maybe it's tangential to it
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000]  is that the traditional media
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000]  used to be the standard bearer
[02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  for the First Amendment.
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000]  We depended on organizations
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  like the Washington Post and the AP
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  and the New York Times
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:12.000]  to take these fights all the way.
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:16.000]  If you read about the Pentagon Papers case
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  and you think about what they did at that time,
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:22.000]  just how much they fought for our freedom
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:23.000]  at that time,
[02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000]  the newspapers were really a proud soldier
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:26.000]  in that fight.
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:30.000]  And now, I remember when my career first started
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:33.000]  and I'd see cases go on
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:36.000]  and I'd see traditional media come
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000]  and fight these cases
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:41.000]  and they would make sure to fight them so narrowly
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  because this is when blogs were first starting to come up.
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000]  The new media was first starting to come up
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:49.000]  and I saw them carefully tailoring their legal arguments
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  to make sure that that circle
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000]  only encompassed their corporate interests
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000]  and it really annoyed me.
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:58.000]  Then I see, for example,
[02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:01.000]  Florida recently passed an anti-slap law finally
[02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:04.000]  and it made sure to listen to corporate lobbyists
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  that ensured that it didn't apply to the little people.
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  It only applies to the big guys.
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:13.000]  I see cases like these open courts cases
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:16.000]  where I've got new media people,
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:20.000]  like Mike Cernovich we talked about before coming in
[02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000]  and he's fighting to open the thing
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  and then the Miami Herald shows up 13, 14 months later
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:28.000]  and decides, well, here we are, Johnny, come lately.
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:31.000]  The problem is the mainstream media has fallen asleep
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  at the switch largely, I think, because of corporate ownership.
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000]  It's no longer independent.
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:37.000]  I agree.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000]  It's no longer fighting to bring the news to us
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000]  and it's no longer fighting for the First Amendment.
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000]  I agree, but the perfect storm
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:46.000]  is that corporate media doesn't have the power.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000]  It's having layoffs.
[02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000]  It's consolidating. It's falling apart.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  That's why they want to demonize me.
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000]  They can't just put it out in the New York Times or something.
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:57.000]  They've got a syndicated everywhere, over and over and over again,
[02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:00.000]  and their final power is still to all get together
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000]  and just chirp the same line for long enough
[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000]  and then they can still get a new war.
[02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:07.000]  They can still get a scam like Obamacare through.
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.000]  They can still defraud people when they all work together.
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:13.000]  The problem is even that power is dissipating.
[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  And so you have corporate media, Republican blue bloods,
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:19.000]  Democrat establishment, multinational corporations,
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  Communist Chinese coming to Davos last year and saying,
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:27.000]  don't worry, we'll defeat the rebellion of Europe against the EU.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  Unelected EU.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  We will defeat Trump and his populist movement.
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  Look at NewsWars.com, brand new article.
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:37.000]  Soros unveils plan to save the EU
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:40.000]  and it goes through, oh, a big global Marshall plan
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000]  and how to go into the countries
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  and stop them from kicking them out
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:48.000]  and how to flood them with even more refugees.
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  On and on and on and on and on.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  This is unbelievable tyranny at NewsWars.com.
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  Very powerful article that everybody needs to get out.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:57.000]  But that's what we're dealing with.
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000]  When we come back in a moment for another five minutes
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  before David Knight comes in loaded for bear,
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.000]  we have who was behind the whole Starbucks situation
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  and a quick special report on that
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000]  that one of our reporters put together.
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000]  But this is shocking stuff.
[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  Again, we have Mark Rondaza, rondaza.com, r-a-n-d-a-z-z-a.com.
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  You've got offices in how many cities?
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:23.000]  We've got Massachusetts, Connecticut, Florida,
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  California, and Las Vegas.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  And you're busy now, Dennis?
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000]  I am quite busy, yeah.
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:33.000]  I'm on airplanes pretty much a couple days a week.
[02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  Well, I got to tell you, we are up against
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000]  very tumultuous times and when this is all
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  setting down the dust settles, history will be here.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:42.000]  Ride Shot, come with me for one more segment.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  Sure.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  For David Knight to come in and we can have that meeting.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000]  We were going to talk about some stuff
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  with Baylin and some other people before we go any further.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  Listen, it's simple.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:55.000]  They made us stronger by going after our sponsors
[02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  and six, seven years ago stripping most of them.
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  And I said, you know, I know what high quality products are.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  I already sell my own books, my own films,
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  my own t-shirts, my own coffee cups.
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  I said, in short way radios and cool stuff.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  I said, I'll just go out with the top firms in the country
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  and I'll put out some of the best supplements out there
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000]  and then slash the prices.
[02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  I'll just go out and sell the very best water filtration
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:17.000]  and air filtration.
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000]  I'll just go out and sell the highest quality storeable foods.
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:22.000]  I'll just do it all myself and we've expanded in four words
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000]  in the face of that and they hate this model
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:27.000]  because if it picks up other places in the independent media,
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  whether you be liberal, conservative, Christian,
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:32.000]  whatever it is, this is what works.
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  And it's selling good products at really great prices
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  to the listeners where they like them and they buy them again
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  and then you're self-sufficient and now the big corporations
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  can't control you with the ad apocalypse and all the bullying
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  and now they're taking the liberals advertising on YouTube.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.000]  The answer is direct sales and we've got free shipping
[02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  on all our best-selling items at infowarstore.com

[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000]  went out to the top lab in the country.
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  I said, I want the strongest, best wide-spectrum probiotic out there.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  We've got it and when you purchase it, it funds our operation.
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:22.000]  A true 360 win.

[02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:51.000]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:52.000]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:56.000]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet,
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000]  it was just blue text on a white screen
[02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:04.000]  and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  and I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000]  and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.000]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  and since then I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality Decay Man,
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:20.000]  the Real Red Pill, MycoZX body.
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  It's all amazing.
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:22.000]  Thank you, brother.
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much,
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body,
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:30.000]  you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God,
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000]  but the more you chase God.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:38.000]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you,
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:42.000]  the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:50.000]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy
[02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:53.000]  for their commencement and said, America is back.
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:56.000]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore,
[02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:00.000]  but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge
[02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:03.000]  and the world is taking notice.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day
[02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000]  and the great sacrifices of our veterans,
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:10.000]  we are offering free shipping at infowarstore.com

[02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000]  Help support the information war,
[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  get great products at the same time,
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:24.000]  and continue to fund an operation that is the thorn on the side of the globalist
[02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:28.000]  and is continuing to back President Trump and other patriots,
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:31.000]  not just here but worldwide, in support of free market capitalism,
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:34.000]  support of Christianity, support of family,
[02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000]  support of basic freedom.
[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:40.000]  Huge Memorial Day specials are running throughout this weekend
[02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000]  until the month of May ends.
[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:59.000]  And then infowarstore.com and infowarcelife.com take advantage today.
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000]  That's according to Website InfoWars.
[03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  It's how we get confirmed there are recent shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:23.000]  After Martin Luther King has been shot to death and messed with Tennessee,
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  It was almost a just a planned impulsion.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  It just panicked.
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  They took the babies out of the incubators.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  They left the children with their agricultural farms.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they were operating.
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  Folks, David Knight and others are coming in in the next hour.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.000]  Then there's the war room with Owen Stroyer, Roger Stone, Mark Rondaza,
[03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  Rondaza.com, great First Amendment lawyer is here with us.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:58.000]  I wanted to do one more big piece of news here.
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:05.000]  When that Starbucks racial bias training will be costly but could pay off in the long run.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  Now, why did they do this when it tanked their stock last year,
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  asking white people they were racist when you came in to get a coffee?
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:14.000]  It's bizarre.
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:15.000]  Why did they do this?
[03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  Because it's part of creating hysteria.
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  It's part of turning the general country into what universities already are.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:28.000]  It is turning the country as Rondaza said earlier into a giant reeducation camp in their own words.
[03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  But the perception institute, research, representation, reality, making reality,
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  what do they say here in the article?
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:42.000]  Who do they say on their own website they're funded by?
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.000]  By the Open Society Foundation, that's George Soros,
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  by the Ford Foundation, that's Liberation Theology,
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:52.000]  and all these same groups, the California Endowment,
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  are trying to create this division and this control because at the top of the pyramid,
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  they want us fighting, as Rondaza said earlier, down lower in the pyramid.
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  So we're going to play this quick one minute report, breaking it down,
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:07.000]  and then get Mark Rondaza's take on it. Here it is.
[03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:12.000]  You may have heard that Starbucks is closing up shop today to implement mandatory implicit bias training.
[03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  The move will cost an estimated $12 million in lost revenue,
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:20.000]  and critics say that it amounts to no more than virtue signaling.
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:24.000]  What's worse, experts claim that when you mandate this type of training,
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000]  it actually does more harm than good.
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  How would Starbucks go through with such a controversial move when it's costly and ineffective?
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:36.000]  Meet the Perception Institute, a think tank with the goal of propping up intersectionality,
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  which is at the cornerstone of the liberal thought plantation.
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:44.000]  Here's the kicker. The Perception Institute is supported by, you guessed it,
[03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:50.000]  the George Soros Open Society Foundation, as well as another globalist foundation, the Ford Foundation.
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:54.000]  Now that we're able to follow the money, we can see exactly how the story turns.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  The Perception Institute has partnered with Starbucks to set the precedent for other companies
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  to mandate this type of training and make it a cultural norm.
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  If this is something you're opposed to, try supporting the local coffee shop,
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:10.000]  where you can check out more reports like these at infowars.com. Matt Webber reporting.
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  That's a quick report he fired out. Good job on the research on that, Matt Webber.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  Mark Rondaza, I mean, it's just, it's always the same players.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  Look, first off, I'm from New England, so I go to Dunkin' Donuts anyway.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  I can avoid Starbucks. I do. I don't like their coffee. I don't like the atmosphere.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  But, you know, if, when you look at something like this,
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:34.000]  you got to think about it in terms of what is this corporation trying to tell society?
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  You know, are they, dude, they must have at some level some idea
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  that either this is going to make them more money or it's going to steer things in a direction that they want.
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  You know, this article here says it's going to be costly, but it may pay off in the end.
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:52.000]  I'm not really sure how. I haven't seen any part of this.
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:56.000]  The paying off is the global mission for the corporations all unified, pushing this crap.
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  They're getting rid of religion and the new religion is this.
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:00.000]  Perhaps.
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  I'm sorry, I'm racist.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  Well, it's like, you know, it seems to me that today, look, I think fighting racism is a normal,
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  excuse me, a noble cause.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:17.000]  But it seems to me that it is becoming what communism was in the 50s during the Red Scare.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  Not that, you know, somebody is actually racist, but it's this question.
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  I can't, you know, I think at some point we're going to see people in front of microphones being asked,
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:30.000]  are you now or have you ever been affiliated with somebody who could be perceived as racist?
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:34.000]  That's right. What they're doing is initiating a class war.
[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:41.000]  What they're doing is initiating culture war and they admit they're doing it and they're manipulating the poor folks at the lowest levels of it.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  I'm not seeing bars or having reparations where blacks get free drinks.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  Look at that.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  In reality, I think, you know, these people should understand we all do actually get along pretty well.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  That's right, they're trying to make us not get along.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:05:15.000]  Alright, David Knight's coming up.
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:26.000]  Your Bumate Leaf Extract. And more.

[03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:58.000]  Alex Jones.
[03:05:58.000 --> 03:05:59.000]  Alex Jones.
[03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:02.000]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:11.000]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:20.000]  It sounds like it confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:23.000]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:26.000]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:29.000]  It was almost as if this was a planned infusion.
[03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000]  It just panicked.
[03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000]  He took the baby out of the incubators.
[03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000]  He left the children to die on the cold spot.
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:38.000]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:45.000]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they were operating in areas that we can't control.
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:46.000]  USA.
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000]  Is this global governance at last?
[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:51.000]  Is it one world the central bank has been charged?
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000]  Israel claims the fact was accidental.
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:56.000]  Some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[03:06:56.000 --> 03:07:00.000]  They describe today's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:05.000]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  Russian, stop!
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000]  He denied everything. He called it all fake news.
[03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:12.000]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000]  This is a national emergency.
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:20.000]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000]  This is a female high-level emergency.
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:25.000]  We are at war with Russia.
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:31.000]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange in which weeks?
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:34.000]  The White House and the president are citing info wars.
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:37.000]  They can shut us down. You're next.
[03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:41.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:07:41.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:12.000]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f**k you, f**k you.
[03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:15.000]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000]  Why don't we just try love?
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000]  Why don't we just try love?
[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:27.000]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf**kers to change something.
[03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:30.000]  Steve Jobs is crazy. Now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000]  They say Trump's crazy. They say I'm crazy.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000]  But I'm here to show love.
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000]  It's a bigger plan.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:40.000]  It's doing what the universe told me.
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:52.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:56.000]  All right, welcome back. This is David Knight with Tyler Nixon.
[03:08:56.000 --> 03:09:03.000]  And we're going to talk about free speech and the many attacks on free speech that are happening right now because it's not just what's happening with Tommy Robinson.
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:07.000]  I mean, that's pretty amazing as we look at what's going on in the UK.
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  And I think when we look at what happened with Roseanne Barr, it shows us that this is not strictly a UK issue.
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:18.000]  We're going to talk about why the two are related coming up.
[03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:22.000]  But you are related to former President Nixon.
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000]  I am. I am very distantly.
[03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  Yes. And so I wanted to talk about the Electoral College because this morning on Real News with David Knight,
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  it was something that I just barely got to.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  We had a clip from Hillary Clinton talking about the Electoral College.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:44.000]  And before we get to that, I want to go back, take a brief flashback to October 27, 2016.
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  And this is about a week before the election.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:57.000]  And we had Politico lecturing President Trump, who was then candidate Trump, lecturing him on how he should handle his upcoming defeat.
[03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:06.000]  And one of the things that they went back to was the Electoral College and the 1960 election that was narrowly lost by Richard Nixon to John F. Kennedy.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  And so they talk about this.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  I said, you know, it looks like President Trump is complaining about how we have a rigged system here that this is,
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:19.000]  we don't really know how he's going to handle this because we're certain, said Politico, a week before the election.
[03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000]  We're certain that President, that Trump is not President Trump.
[03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  We're certain that Trump is going to lose the election.
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:30.000]  Is he going to be a good sport about it like Richard Nixon was? Because, you know, Richard Nixon had a lot more to complain about than President Trump is.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:34.000]  Because President Trump isn't just going to get scumped in this election.
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  But Richard Nixon narrowly lost it to JFK.
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000]  And as they've talked about this.
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  I'm going to say if you read Roger Stone, you know, InfoWars mainstay, Nixon's secrets, as well as the man who killed Kennedy in the case against LBJ,
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  that election was stolen from Richard Nixon.
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  Right here in Texas, as well as in Chicago.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:56.000]  That's right. And that's what they point out in Politico.
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  They say, look, it was a very narrow set of votes.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  I think it was about 8,000 votes or something in Chicago that flipped.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:10.000]  And of course, in Mayor Daley's office, it flipped Illinois for JFK.
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  And then the other key one, as you just mentioned, Tyler, was here in Texas.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  And of course, you had LBJ.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  And as they look at this, they said it was the thinnest of margins.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  His lead in the popular vote was only 118,000 Kennedys lead out of 69 million votes.
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  The tightest popular vote margins since Grover Cleveland's defeat of James G. Blaine in 1884.
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  And Benjamin Harrison's subsequent victory over Cleveland in 1888.
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:39.000]  He won the Electoral College but lost a popular vote by 100,000.
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  So they're looking at this.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  And I think this is very important when we talk about the Electoral College and we talk about how easily elections can be rigged in key areas.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  Because if we don't have an Electoral College and it is simply a one person, one vote, as Hillary Clinton said.
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000]  And of course, she's not looking at one person, one vote.
[03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:03.000]  Because what we really should say is one citizen, one vote.
[03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:08.000]  Because the Democrats now, the game is to stuff the ballot with illegal immigrants.
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  Which is astonishing.
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  I mean, I'm just flabbergasted.
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:14.000]  They've reached the point where it's like, you don't even have to be a citizen.
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000]  You can vote in certain jurisdictions.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  They're trying to register non-citizens to vote.
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000]  I mean, why have a country?
[03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:24.000]  Why have any type of sovereignty?
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  That's right.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000]  Or even claim to have it.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  They're upfront about it.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:31.000]  And so I think there's two key things about the Electoral College.
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:32.000]  I want to see if you agree.
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:35.000]  Number one, in the wisdom of the founding fathers, they said,
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  we don't want to have the vast majority of the country ruled by a few very densely packed areas, which is what would happen with a rigged popular vote.
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.000]  And we know that that's what would happen.
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:53.000]  And I've seen this as a matter of fact in county elections back in North Carolina.
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:13:01.000]  We had a switch from a situation where we had it broken down into certain regions.
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:12.000]  And so you had one little corner of the county was highly and densely populated from people who had spilled over from the county that had a very liberal college in it.
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:20.000]  And the rest of the districts in the county were very lightly populated with farming families that have been there for generations.
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:26.000]  And they changed the district representation.
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  They changed it to an at large.
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:34.000]  And what happened was this small corner that had such a large population,
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:40.000]  they wound up taking over the entire county government and changing everything to a very left-wing agenda.
[03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  I can speak to that as well in this little state of Delaware.
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  The northern county Newcastle County is completely dominated by labor Democrats and has been for many years.
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  And they rule the state.
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  It doesn't matter if the entire lower two counties are largely very conservative and Republican, the further south you get,
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:03.000]  the state is basically at the mercy of the northern liberal Democrats.
[03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:06.000]  And that's why you need an allocation.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  The Electoral College is a perfect example of it.
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:16.000]  In the Federalist Papers, they wanted a diffusion of the direct popular power, the direct Democratic power.
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  We are not a democracy, we are a representative of a republic, and that's the whole point of it,
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:29.000]  is not to have the inflamed impassions of the people or any particular very close votes way
[03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  within a national, say, or a giant popular election be able to determine the fate of everybody
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  without there being sort of a breakdown of those constituents.
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:40.000]  Now, remember, we're the United States of America.
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:44.000]  And people think of that as one thing, but no, it's the United States as in plural.
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:48.000]  That's what is the constituents of this country.
[03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:52.000]  Prior to the Civil War, people talk about the United States are.
[03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:55.000]  And then after the Civil War, they talk about the United States is.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:01.000]  They saw it as a single administrative entity in a top-down pyramid structure, but it was never envisioned to be that way.
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  The Tenth Amendment makes it clear that they wanted to have powers reserved to these individual states
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:11.000]  because the thing that the founders feared the most was the consolidation of power into a central area.
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:14.000]  And that's what we would have if we didn't have the Electoral College.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:19.000]  We would have a consolidation of power into urban centers, which is what these people like to have.
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  We're supposed to have a federal republic.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  What we've been moving towards since the era of FDR is a unitary national state.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  It's all concentrated nationally.
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:30.000]  That's it.
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  We're, like you said, we're one giant government, not a constituent of these states, not a creation of the states.
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  And that's the way, obviously, the centralized authoritarian status wanted.
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:42.000]  That's right. All right, we've got to take a quick break. We're going to be right back.
[03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  I'm David Knight with Tyler Nixon.
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:47.000]  We're going to play that clip from Hillary Clinton, and then we're going to get into free speech issues.

[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:32.000]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight, and we're here with Tyler Nixon, and before we get into the free speech issues, and of course they just keep coming.
[03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:40.000]  It's not just Tommy Robinson, it's not just the slap lawsuits against InfoWars, but now we have Roseanne Barr taking off the air.
[03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  If you want to get to that in just a moment, unpack that as well as I want to get Tyler's take on this court decision saying that Trump cannot block anybody or even mute them on Twitter.
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:21:02.000]  It's an interesting court decision, and I think it's going to backfire on them just as I think the takeover of the Italian election is going to backfire on the globalist.
[03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:21.000]  Let's finish up with the Electoral College, because we had Hillary Clinton in her self-pity tour, weigh in on this again, and just as a reminder, a week before the election in 2016, we had Politico lecturing President Trump, who was then candidate Trump, lecturing him on being a gracious loser.
[03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:34.000]  Nixon believed that the election was stolen from him by corruption in Chicago, where Mayor Daley was there. They had that whole state was flipped by 8,800 votes, largely due to margins in Chicago, where Mayor Daley was there.
[03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:41.000]  Very well known as a corrupt individual. And then the other place where it was flipped was in Texas, home of LBJ.
[03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:54.000]  And they said if Nixon had carried both of these states, he would have easily won the Electoral College 270 to 252. And they said, well, the FBI believed that Daley had flipped this.
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:57.000]  So it was a question about the FBI, because they had people listening to Daley.
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:05.000]  You also got to think, with a margin that thin, 8,800 votes, I guarantee you they were flipping, you know, there was a lot more vote corruption than that.
[03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  So you got to think Nixon would have probably won convincingly in those two states. Just the fact that it's that slim a margin even with the corruption.
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:19.000]  Well, it was a little bit more in Texas. And when they're talking about this, one of the individuals who reported on this at the time wrote a book on it.
[03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:24.000]  As you pointed out, Roger Stone has written a book on it as well. But this one individual said, well, in Texas it was a little bit larger.
[03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:32.000]  It was 46,000 fraudulent votes would have had, were required a skilled manipulator. You don't think that Lyndon Johnson is a skilled manipulator?
[03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:39.000]  No, no, that's totally, that makes total sense. Lyndon didn't, he stole big time. He didn't steal small time for sure.
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:43.000]  That's right. It was mostly old stuff. And he had a lot of people in Texas to help him.
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  But I want to play for you what Hillary Clinton said about the Electoral College, because she is so desperate.
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:57.000]  Maybe we should send this article from Politico a week before the 2016 election, where they were lecturing Trump on how to be a good loser,
[03:22:57.000 --> 03:23:03.000]  because it was quite clear to them that he was going to lose by much larger margin. Maybe we should send that article to Hillary Clinton.
[03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:08.000]  But here she is on her self-pity tour now talking about the Electoral College. And it's not just Hillary Clinton.
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:16.000]  A lot of Democrats are talking about the Electoral College. They want to get rid of one more safeguard that the founders put into the Constitution.
[03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:18.000]  Here's Hillary Clinton.
[03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:28.000]  So, and finally, I know this is another really obvious thing to say, vote in every election, not just presidential elections.
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:40.000]  You know, it is maddening because one of the panelists said, we get the government that we vote for.
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:51.000]  Now, we have this odd system with the Electoral College, and maybe, you know, we could get President Faust to explain the roots of that,
[03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  because it's a little troubling. But nevertheless, we've got it. I've been against it, by the way, since 2000.
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:08.000]  Not that you need to know that, but I have been, because I just think it is absolutely contrary to, you know, one person, one vote.
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:14.000]  So, you've got to find an issue that you really care about and go deep.
[03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:18.000]  All right, so there's Hillary Clinton. She said, we have this odd system that's called the Constitution.
[03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:24.000]  She's been against it since 2000, and she wants all of us to be against the Constitution as well.
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:32.000]  And it's not just the concentration of political power into urban centers that would be what we wind up with nationwide, not just in state by state.
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  I mean, in Virginia, you talked about your experience. In Virginia, you've got the areas just outside of Washington, D.C. as well as Virginia Beach.
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:47.000]  They dominate that otherwise conservative state. But that would be what would happen nationally if we didn't have the Electoral College.
[03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:49.000]  But, you know, she doesn't like that.
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:58.000]  Well, she's been against it since 2000, you know, so, and I'm sure that if Hillary had won the election that, you know, she would have been calling for the abolition of the Electoral College as well.
[03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:03.000]  And the Second Amendment, she would be rewriting the Constitution as we speak. It would be very quick.
[03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  You know, one more thing I want to say about this.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:08.000]  The loser of all time, Hillary Clinton. That's right.
[03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:18.000]  And one of the reasons that you've got the Democrats pushing so hard to get rid of the Electoral College, let's understand, this is about illegal immigrants, foreign citizens.
[03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  Okay, illegal immigrants are foreign citizens. They're criminally trespassing in nine states. She wants them to vote, as do the other Democrats.
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:33.000]  And the state of Alabama is now suing the Department of Commerce and the Bureau of Census to make sure that illegal aliens are not included in the census.
[03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  Because if they are, then the apportionment of congressional seats is going to work to the advantage of California.
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  It will make them more powerful by counting the illegal immigrants.
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:55.000]  And so the state of Alabama is saying, we don't do that. We're not a sanctuary state. And so we don't want foreign citizens counted in California so that California can get more federal power.
[03:25:55.000 --> 03:26:00.000]  Oh, it's complete insanity. I mean, you know, what it is, it's majoritarian force.
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  They just want to overwhelm all the safeguards that the founders put in place to protect, you know, from majoritarian tyranny, which was the whole point of our system.
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  It was very carefully constructed with, you know, the checks and balances, the balance of power between, you know, amongst the branches.
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:25.000]  And as well as the way the voting was not to be direct, you know, direct voting, direct democracy on any issue or any particular election, with the exception of the elections of the House of Representatives.
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  And, you know, as you know, the United States Senate used to be directly or elected only by the state legislatures.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  And that was changed by the, I believe, the 20th...
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:41.000]  Early 20th century, yeah. It was right around the time that they frustrated the power of everybody with the federal reserve and the income tax.
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  Yeah, it was all in one fell swoop.
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:44.000]  That's right.
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:48.000]  The ability for the state legislatures to assert states' rights, in a sense.
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  And I'm not saying that with a loaded term. I mean, literally the state's...
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:52.000]  Well, state power.
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  State power, correct.
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:27:01.000]  Sovereignty, their ability, you know, the state's ability as individual jurisdictions to have a say over how the country, you know, what the fate of the country is.
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:04.000]  They used to elect the United States Senate. People don't realize that.
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:07.000]  Now it's a direct election, and now they want the president directly elected.
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:14.000]  So, you know, they're just trying to overwhelm, again, the barriers that keep the Constitution in place, that keep us from being overwhelmed by majoritarian tyranny.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:19.000]  That's right. It was about a balance of power. It was about checks and balances in that power.
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:26.000]  It was about making sure that the states, essentially, if we were to look at it today, it would be as if we had the United Nations.
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:31.000]  We decide to get out of the United Nations, and they decide that we're not going to get out.
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  And then afterwards, we just become an administrative arm of the United Nations, and we don't get to have any say so in what is happening there.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  Don't give them any ideas, David.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:51.000]  Yeah, I know. Well, I can see it coming. I can see it coming not over slavery, but over something like the environment, you know, taking everybody's power away from them.
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:59.000]  It's also part of globalism, basically. They want a global government, and, you know, having all these barriers and these sub-jurisdictions does not serve that purpose.
[03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:00.000]  That's right.
[03:28:00.000 --> 03:28:07.000]  They just want the mass that they can manipulate and say, hey, everybody voted for this, and therefore, you know, the whole world's got to abide by this, or the whole world's got to live with it.
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  Which, of course, you know, is ultimately manipulated anyway.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:12.000]  And I wouldn't trust any of these mass elections.
[03:28:12.000 --> 03:28:21.000]  And the fact of the local, you know, we have local jurisdictions, local sovereignties being able to control their own elections also is a backstop against fraud, against things like that.
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:22.000]  That's right.
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:23.000]  That would rig elections.
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:32.000]  I think that the, I talked to Michael Mahary of the Tenth Amendment Center earlier today on Real News, the morning broadcast, and he was making that case.
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:38.000]  He said, look, we're not going to get Washington to surrender power so that we can have our liberty back.
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:43.000]  We're going to have to take it at the local level. We're going to have to reassert the Tenth Amendment.
[03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  And we can see that happening with medical marijuana.
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:51.000]  We can see that happening with people putting teachers in schools with guns, even though the feds have a law against that.
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:29:20.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:23.000]  It is The Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[03:33:23.000 --> 03:33:31.000]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight here with Tyler Nixon and let's take a look at the free speech issues because we've just had another one pop up and that's Roseanne Barr.
[03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:40.000]  She has now been canceled by ABC News because they didn't like what she tweeted and understand that this show that they've just canceled, they had already renewed it, why?
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:47.000]  Because it is the most popular television show on TV. ABC canceled this and of course they're owned by Disney.
[03:33:47.000 --> 03:33:57.000]  It was the season's number one scripted series on all of broadcast television. It was the highest rated, most watched series of the entire season and they have canceled it.
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:07.000]  Because Tyler, just like we're seeing with the bomb of the Han Solo Star Wars thing, I think when you look at Disney getting involved in Star Wars,
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:14.000]  they're more interested in selling their political agenda and their political correctness than they are in ratings or in profits.
[03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:16.000]  I mean that comes first, doesn't it?
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:17.000]  Or even just entertainment period.
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:30.000]  That's right. I mean Roseanne was very, this was a cutting edge show. It used to be that we would celebrate something that was able to be a sensation that maybe had some political undertones or even overtones to it.
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:41.000]  Because hey listen, you know, got people talking, it brought it out into issues into the open. Murphy Brown was a big sensation. I granted it was for the other side relatively back in 1991-92.
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:47.000]  But now, forget it, Tim Allen silenced off the air. You know, hugely popular. Roseanne Barr, you know, and Roseanne...
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:49.000]  And it was ABC that canceled Tim Allen.
[03:34:49.000 --> 03:34:57.000]  Oh yeah, no, same network, same network. No, they don't care about entertainment. They apparently don't care about ratings or even money, profits, whatever, advertising.
[03:34:57.000 --> 03:35:11.000]  None of it. It matters to them only that they silence their opponents, that they not have any type of straying from their speech code from what they think is acceptable discussion, acceptable discourse, even in a, you know, light hearted.
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:15.000]  Although, you know, I honestly feel like that was a show that could bridge the divide.
[03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:25.000]  They could bring people, bring issues out in the open in a way that people could relate to, that they could understand, hey, we can have these discussions and not be like at each other's throats all the time about it.
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:38.000]  And maybe simplify it somewhat. Because, you know, she used to be a very, very liberal oriented, hated Bush and was always, you know, and look, she is consistent in terms of her, you know, she's an honest person, can't have that on the air.
[03:35:38.000 --> 03:35:48.000]  Well, let's take a look at some of the sins of Roseanne Barr. Earlier in the day, before it was put out that she was canceled, the headline was this.
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:57.000]  Roseanne Barr goes on wild and racist tweet storm about Clinton's George Soros and Chris Saliza and some of the things that she had to say.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:03.000]  She said that George Soros is trying to overthrow the Constitutional Republic. She talked about CIA Mind Control and MK Ultra.
[03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:15.000]  I wonder why she would do that. Oh, that may be because we've got a court case in Canada now of relatives of victims of the MK Ultra program back in the 1970s.
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:20.000]  And as a matter of fact, I'm going to talk to one of them tomorrow morning on real news with David Knight.
[03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:24.000]  If you want to catch that, we're going to have somebody who lived this firsthand.
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  And folks, Mind Control by the CIA, these projects by the CIA by DARPA have not ended.
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:38.000]  You had a $4 billion allocation to the Brain Project, and that was an acronym, just like DARPA is an acronym, under Obama.
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:45.000]  They are still working on ways to alter people's personalities, to implant memories, to delete memories.
[03:36:45.000 --> 03:36:49.000]  And so this is something that only the technology has changed and the labeling has changed.
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:53.000]  So she's talking about the crazy idea of CIA Mind Control.
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:58.000]  You're crazy if you don't understand. That's what they had been focused on for the last 60 years.
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:02.000]  She called reporter and effing mouth breather. I don't even know what that means.
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  I think most of us breathe through the mouth anyway, and said that Hillary Clinton was a colostomy jug full of Shiite.
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  I love that woman.
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:25.000]  So the one that now they're focusing on is the fact she said that Valerie Jarrett was a cross between the Muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a baby.
[03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:28.000]  So that was the quote unquote racist tweet.
[03:37:28.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  Let me tell you, it was just a few weeks ago that we had Mel Brooks at 93, I think he was, 93, 91.
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:46.000]  Talking about how in today's environment, he'd never be able to do anything like the producers, where you're kind of making fun of Hitler and the Holocaust and so forth.
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:50.000]  And that was the premise there. As a matter of fact, he had some of the actors who said, I'm not doing that.
[03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:58.000]  They were Jewish, they were a must. But we can't have comedy as we've been told by Monty Python, John Cleese and others.
[03:37:58.000 --> 03:38:02.000]  It's a death of comedy. You couldn't have any comedians like Mel Brooks do their stuff today.
[03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  You couldn't have Monty Python doing their stuff. You couldn't have Rodney Danger and none of these people could do a comedy routine today because of the political correctness.
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:20.000]  Now, the left is nothing if not humorless, dour and consistently hip, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They're phony pieties constantly in your face.
[03:38:20.000 --> 03:38:31.000]  And yeah, it is the death of humor. I mean, George Carlin, you look at, and even Mel Brooks' remake of the famous to be or not to be, which was originally done by Jack Benny in the 1940s.
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:32.000]  Oh, look at Blazing Saddle.
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:33.000]  Yeah, all the race jokes that he had.
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:39.000]  You never, never, my God. And it's very sad just in within our lifetimes. They cannot, you cannot have humor.
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:53.000]  You know, I think of Patrice O'Neill was a great comedian who sadly passed away a few years ago, who was someone who went on Fox News as, you know, a black comedian who was very cutting edge and defended humor.
[03:38:53.000 --> 03:38:58.000]  Defended the ability to say anything because that's the point of it is to push the envelope just as free speech.
[03:38:58.000 --> 03:39:03.000]  The point of it is protect speech that is not acceptable to the main.
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  That is not, you know, that is, that is disturbing to people. That's why you need free speech protections, not to protect what everybody is fine with.
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:12.000]  That's what I have in the first place.
[03:39:12.000 --> 03:39:13.000]  That's right.
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  And I would also point out, you know, this isn't even controversial. There is no question that MK Ultra existed.
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:20.000]  This isn't like a conspiracy theory.
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:22.000]  This was brought out by the church commission.
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:25.000]  This is an acknowledged reality of our government.
[03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:31.000]  They were involved in mind control experiments and everything you can think of horrific stuff documented, admitted.
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  Same thing with Mockingbird.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  You know, the project or Operation Mockingbird where the, you know, it was Colby at the time could not testify openly as to the implanting or the emplacement of CIA assets in every major news organization in our country.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:51.000]  And that's not just there, but it's also in presidential campaigns.
[03:39:51.000 --> 03:39:52.000]  Yeah, no, of course.
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:40:00.000]  Yeah, and it's informant, right? This guy just, you know, who worked with the CIA, whose brother is involved, or he has a family member, I believe, is related, involved.
[03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  You know, I'm talking about with, he's MI6, something along those lines.
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:06.000]  Yeah.
[03:40:06.000 --> 03:40:10.000]  These people are the spooks. These people are the ones who, you know, dance in the ring.
[03:40:10.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  Oh, there's a definite connection between London and Langley. I talked about that this morning.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:15.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:20.000]  You got all these different people. You even got Stefan Halper, who's an American, but he was working in Cambridge.
[03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:29.000]  And he throws out a little bit of a bone to Brennan and these other people saying, you know, I think, I saw Michael Flynn talking to a Russian at a history symposium.
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:32.000]  So maybe you should investigate the entire Trump campaign.
[03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:34.000]  And so that's the little wedge that they use to get that in there.
[03:40:34.000 --> 03:40:38.000]  But we're talking about the death of humor, the death of comedy.
[03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:45.000]  And folks, if we don't get rid of this concept of hate speech, it will be the death of free speech.
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:54.000]  And that's what we're seeing here, I think, with Roseanne, because when we look at Tommy Robinson, we have to understand that the First Amendment was eviscerated in Europe,
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  because the European Union and the UN saying that if you say something that is offensive to somebody, we're going to shut you down.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:10.000]  Now, that is at the root of the UK's beef with Tommy Robinson when he's out there reporting on these Muslim pedophile gangs.
[03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:18.000]  That's basically their understanding of that. But it's now gone way beyond that, because it's bad enough that they would arrest him,
[03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  that they would give him this kangaroo court process where in just one day he would be arrested, have a quick speedy trial without a lawyer,
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:27.000]  and be sent to jail for 13 months.
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  But then when the judge takes it to the next level and says, nobody can report on this, and if you report it on it, you've got to flush it down the memory hole.
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:41.000]  That is the thing that's making everybody say, what in the world has happened to the UK?
[03:41:41.000 --> 03:41:50.000]  Why even have that process? It's a joke. One day the judge rules on this guy and sends him away and says, you can't report on it.
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:59.000]  That's not substantive or procedural due process. They might have all literally just issued a dicta from whatever murky powers were behind this and just lock him away.
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:09.000]  Why even present him before a court? I mean, it's a farce, it's a complete joke, and this is why we threw off the chains of the British Empire.
[03:42:09.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  Let's not forget, folks.
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:17.000]  That's right. That and religious freedom, free exercise, religion. But if we go back and look at the tactic, Tyler, that the judge is using,
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:24.000]  he's using something that's called a de-notice. What does the de-notice mean? It means defense.
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:30.000]  Everything in America has been, we're told that we don't have any privacy, we don't have any liberty.
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:34.000]  They're going to surveil us because we have to do something for national security.
[03:42:34.000 --> 03:42:41.000]  How is putting a gag order on news media about this kangaroo court proceedings on Tommy Robinson?
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:46.000]  How does that relate to national security? It doesn't make any sense at all. Stay with us. We'll be right back.

[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:23.000]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:28.000]  That's right, they just tell us what they think we ought to know and if they think we should know it.
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:31.000]  They put a gag order, at least that's the way they do it in the UK.
[03:47:31.000 --> 03:47:41.000]  I'm David Knight here with Tyler Nixon and we're going to be going to Harrison Smith in the UK to give us a live update on what is happening there with Tommy Robinson.
[03:47:41.000 --> 03:47:46.000]  We were pointing out before this judge issued and this is the next step of this.
[03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  First it begins with hate speech and saying we're going to take down anybody if we think that what you're saying is hurtful or if anybody is offended by it, it goes.
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:56.000]  And that is already happening. It happened with Roseanne today.
[03:47:56.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  It is happening to you on social media.
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:02.000]  We have people that are being purged and silenced on social media.
[03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:04.000]  That is how it begins.
[03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:11.000]  And those labels of hate are being put out there by the Southern Poverty Law Center by Snopes and by others on the left.
[03:48:11.000 --> 03:48:20.000]  And if we allow this to happen, folks, we are going to be sliding into the same kind of censorship that we see in the UK, but they've taken it another step further.
[03:48:20.000 --> 03:48:28.000]  Now they have gone through a kangaroo court process and the same day they arrested Tommy Robinson, the judge sentenced him to 13 months in jail,
[03:48:28.000 --> 03:48:36.000]  took him off without a lawyer due process and then he put out a denotus which used to stand for defense.
[03:48:36.000 --> 03:48:38.000]  That's what it originally stood for.
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:43.000]  Now I guess as we're talking about over the break, Tyler, I guess now the D stands for disappearance.
[03:48:43.000 --> 03:48:49.000]  That appears to be what they are using it for now because you can't argue that this is an issue of national defense.
[03:48:49.000 --> 03:48:50.000]  Who are they defending?
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:51.000]  Right.
[03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:54.000]  Are they defending their culpability in protecting these Muslim gangs?
[03:48:54.000 --> 03:48:58.000]  Well, I mean national security now, it's code for control basically is what they want.
[03:48:58.000 --> 03:49:01.000]  They want control and that's what they'll use it for.
[03:49:01.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  They're control freaks basically.
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:06.000]  You look at someone like a Brennan who is a complete psychopath.
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:10.000]  I mean, what this man thinks, I mean, he literally, it's like, you're out of power, man.
[03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:11.000]  Like you're done.
[03:49:11.000 --> 03:49:14.000]  So stop threatening the president and acting like you're still in power.
[03:49:14.000 --> 03:49:15.000]  And over there, obviously...
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:16.000]  Who knows, maybe he is.
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:17.000]  Yeah, right.
[03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:18.000]  God only knows.
[03:49:18.000 --> 03:49:19.000]  All right, let's go to...
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:27.000]  We got Harrison standing by, Harrison Smith and the UK Harrison, do you have an update on the status of Tommy Robinson?
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:31.000]  Well, I got to say that intro song could not be more appropriate.
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  What I've been doing here is you can see I'm in front of the London Bridge on the pier here.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:40.000]  And I've been asking people from London locals what they know about the Tommy Robinson trial.
[03:49:40.000 --> 03:49:44.000]  And they all are informed, but they're misinformed.
[03:49:44.000 --> 03:49:50.000]  You know, I had one guy say, well, you know, I heard the judge tell him specifically that he was not allowed in the courtroom.
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:53.000]  So he goes in the courtroom, I'm glad that he got caught.
[03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:55.000]  And I say, well, you know, he wasn't in the courtroom.
[03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:56.000]  He says, oh.
[03:49:56.000 --> 03:49:57.000]  Oh, really?
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  I said, yeah.
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:49:59.000]  And there were a couple other things.
[03:49:59.000 --> 03:50:05.000]  And so I kept asking him, are you not concerned that you're making decisions with incomplete or incorrect information?
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:07.000]  And it's like it doesn't even phase them.
[03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:12.000]  You know, this particular guy, at least, was just like, yeah, well, you know, that's just the way it is sometimes.
[03:50:12.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  And if the court says that they had a reason, then they had a reason.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:16.000]  And there it is.
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:17.000]  It's so bizarre.
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  So that song, when it says, you know, they only tell us what they want us to know.
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:27.000]  It's amazing how everybody here has, well, anybody that knows about him has a very strong opinion on Tommy Robinson.
[03:50:27.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  And for the most part, as far as I can tell, it's just based off complete falsehoods.
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:36.000]  And so they can characterize this any way they want, as long as they put a gag order on the press.
[03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:42.000]  And I think the other side of this is the supine compliance of the British press,
[03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:47.000]  where they just bow down to this judge and they're not going to stand up against that.
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:52.000]  You know, we just had the left congratulating themselves about the Pentagon Papers.
[03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:55.000]  And I think the Washington Post did the right thing in terms of putting that out.
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:58.000]  Maybe you should ask them about Julian Assange.
[03:50:58.000 --> 03:51:02.000]  I mean, they, you know, they don't support the free press with Julian Assange.
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:04.000]  They don't support it with Tommy Robinson.
[03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:09.000]  If you can get beyond what you think about Julian Assange or what you think about Tommy Robinson
[03:51:09.000 --> 03:51:14.000]  and look at the principle of having an open, free society where you've got a free press,
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:19.000]  I mean, that's really the issue here. Get beyond the left and right thinking.
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:23.000]  Yeah, absolutely. And the Julian Assange point is excellent,
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  especially how the Democrats have this habit of Trump, Trump will point out,
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:32.000]  President Trump will point out that the press is lying and they say, oh, it's an attack on the press.
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:36.000]  He hates the press. He hates the free press and he's going to destroy it all.
[03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  And then you have Julian Assange airs some of their dirty laundry and they're just like, hey, can we kill this guy?
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:49.000]  Let's go ahead and kill this guy. You know, I mean, it's just incredible that the dichotomy that's being set up here,
[03:51:49.000 --> 03:51:51.000]  it's just absolutely ridiculous.
[03:51:51.000 --> 03:51:55.000]  Yeah, I had to respond to a tweet actually. Well, the statement Adam Schiff says he won't,
[03:51:55.000 --> 03:52:00.000]  Assange is offered to speak to Adam Schiff and, you know, clear Trump and say there was no collusion.
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:03.000]  And he says not unless he's extradited and someone said when he's extradited.
[03:52:03.000 --> 03:52:06.000]  So, well, you have to be charged with a crime to be extradited, right?
[03:52:06.000 --> 03:52:10.000]  The Justice Department's last position was Assange is committed no crimes,
[03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:14.000]  unless you want to jail the New York Times and everyone, you know, Pentagon jail the New York Times,
[03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:19.000]  jail the Washington Post, and we should dig up the graves of Ben Bradley and Catherine Grant.
[03:52:19.000 --> 03:52:29.000]  I think they're deceased. You know, dig them up and, you know, desecrate their bodies because they're not worthy of being respected.
[03:52:29.000 --> 03:52:33.000]  But that's the double think of the left, isn't it?
[03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:40.000]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And especially with the Tommy Robinson case, I mean, it's just so Orwellian, right?
[03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:45.000]  I mean, you just, you couldn't get more totalitarian in this way that, I mean, essentially,
[03:52:45.000 --> 03:52:50.000]  he would have just disappeared if it hadn't been, you know, a couple of people with him that saw what happened
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  and then knew what happened that he was able to keep in touch with.
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:52:59.000]  It would have been very easily for them to, you know, arrest this guy, sentence him that very day,
[03:52:59.000 --> 03:53:03.000]  put him away for 13 months and tell no one and have nobody know.
[03:53:03.000 --> 03:53:07.000]  And everybody could just ask questions and answering those questions would have been illegal.
[03:53:07.000 --> 03:53:12.000]  I mean, the level of absurdity, the level of, there's not even a word for it.
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:17.000]  I mean, it's terrifying. It's just a terrifying precedent that's being set in a formerly sort of,
[03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:22.000]  a paragon of free speech and of speaking to power that England once was.
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:25.000]  Well, it's very much like the movie V for Vendetta.
[03:53:25.000 --> 03:53:28.000]  I mean, honestly, the black bags and they carry away and that's the end of you.
[03:53:28.000 --> 03:53:33.000]  I mean, honestly, I never thought in my lifetime I would see that come to life in Great Britain.
[03:53:33.000 --> 03:53:37.000]  Now, I mean, the thing is though, you know, Great Britain, obviously, you know,
[03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:41.000]  there is a lot of history there in terms of human rights, but nobody in Britain has ever said,
[03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:45.000]  I know my rights, you know, because they didn't have them ever enshrined and protected.
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:53:48.000]  You know, it's a royalist society, effectively.
[03:53:48.000 --> 03:53:52.000]  So, you know, they, I mean, we look like just what two weekends ago we had this, you know,
[03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:56.000]  this big parade for the royal wedding and so forth and all this gushing and so forth.
[03:53:56.000 --> 03:54:02.000]  And here's this poor man being literally black bagged and taken off and disappeared in the same country
[03:54:02.000 --> 03:54:05.000]  and within like days. It's very, it's...
[03:54:05.000 --> 03:54:09.000]  I guess one of my questions, Harrison, maybe you might ask people, you know, the denotus.
[03:54:09.000 --> 03:54:11.000]  That was always put up during wartime.
[03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:15.000]  That's when it first started coming out, World War I. They ended it after World War II.
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:19.000]  But then they came up with the denotus. What does the D represent?
[03:54:19.000 --> 03:54:25.000]  It was about national defense. How is taking Tommy Robinson and gagging the press about reporting
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:27.000]  the facts of this case so that people are ignorant?
[03:54:27.000 --> 03:54:32.000]  How is that an issue of national defense? Or who are they defending?
[03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:36.000]  Yeah, well, it's pretty clear cut.
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:40.000]  If you're doing things that you think might cause people to rise up against you,
[03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:46.000]  yeah, I guess it is, you know, in defense of your position, at least, that nobody else knows that it happened, right?
[03:54:46.000 --> 03:54:52.000]  And that's kind of another one of those things. It's almost the more ridiculous their overreach is.
[03:54:52.000 --> 03:54:59.000]  It sort of becomes an argument for the suppression of that being brought to light, right?
[03:54:59.000 --> 03:55:02.000]  It's like, well, we can't tell anybody about this or else they'd be so mad.
[03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:06.000]  I believe there was a leaked quote from Hillary Clinton that said, you know,
[03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  if this gets out, we'll all swing from nooses. I mean, that's essentially what the case is.
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  I think what this represents, and we all understand this is happening.
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:19.000]  We can see it happening in the United States with social media.
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:21.000]  We can see it happening with Roseanne Barr.
[03:55:21.000 --> 03:55:25.000]  If you don't support the free speech of people that you disagree with,
[03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:29.000]  even people that you think are repulsive, then you will have no free speech whatsoever.
[03:55:29.000 --> 03:55:36.000]  This all began with the hate speech laws and so forth that are being imposed on us by our social media oligarchs here.
[03:55:36.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  But we're imposed on the UK by the UN, by the EU, by their redefining of free speech.
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:48.000]  Once you get to that point, and once they're able to silence speech on that basis,
[03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:53.000]  now we have still taken it to the next level with Tommy Robinson and this denotus that should be frightening.
[03:55:53.000 --> 03:55:59.000]  But I think we all see that we're on a slippery slope where we have thrown away the values of Western society
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:01.000]  and what really is tolerance.
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:04.000]  You know, they always want to talk about how, oh, you're so intolerant and everything.
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:06.000]  They're intolerant of speech that they don't agree with.
[03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  Well, how much differently...
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:09.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:12.000]  I was going to say, how much differently is a denotus from national security letters?
[03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:13.000]  FISA warrants.
[03:56:13.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  That's right.
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:15.000]  You know, we have that in our own country right now.
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:16.000]  Let's face it.
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:18.000]  You can't even speak about it if you have a national security letter.
[03:56:18.000 --> 03:56:19.000]  Even to your attorneys.
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:20.000]  That's right.
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:23.000]  I don't see how that jibes with anything, but go ahead, Harrison.
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:24.000]  I'm sorry.
[03:56:24.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  I jumped in there.
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:26.000]  Oh, that's fine.
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:27.000]  Oh, no.
[03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  It reminds me of another story that just came out today of what's our second amendment,
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:36.000]  which is gun control.
[03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:42.000]  In England, a judge just came out and said, maybe we should dole knives.
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:44.000]  Maybe we should blunt the end of knives.
[03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:45.000]  I know.
[03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:52.720]  And so it's this thing where what they really hate is the idea that people are angry enough
[03:56:52.720 --> 03:56:53.720]  to cause violence.
[03:56:53.720 --> 03:56:57.280]  So the end result is, let's just stop people from being angry.
[03:56:57.280 --> 03:56:58.280]  Let's drug people.
[03:56:58.280 --> 03:57:01.600]  So it's really the emotion that's the cause.
[03:57:01.600 --> 03:57:08.000]  Because what they're doing is they're eliminating the use of the tools, but the base cause of
[03:57:08.000 --> 03:57:09.000]  it is still there.
[03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:11.160]  It's the same thing with free speech.
[03:57:11.160 --> 03:57:16.400]  They use hate speech laws or breaching the peace or denoting.
[03:57:16.400 --> 03:57:20.700]  They're trying to eliminate the tools, but really what they want to do is eliminate you
[03:57:20.700 --> 03:57:22.160]  having a free thought at all.
[03:57:22.160 --> 03:57:24.520]  Well, I think this stuff is going to backfire on them.
[03:57:24.520 --> 03:57:29.040]  I think gradually the people of England are going to wake up to this tyranny.
[03:57:29.040 --> 03:57:33.640]  I think the movement by a judge here in the United States saying that President Trump
[03:57:33.640 --> 03:57:35.840]  cannot ban people on Twitter.
[03:57:35.840 --> 03:57:36.840]  He can't block them.
[03:57:36.840 --> 03:57:38.600]  He can't mute them.
[03:57:38.600 --> 03:57:40.240]  Well, if he can't do that.
[03:57:40.240 --> 03:57:47.480]  How can the president of Twitter do that?
[03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:52.440]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[03:57:52.440 --> 03:57:53.440]  yeast.
[03:57:53.440 --> 03:57:57.000]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew

[03:58:38.200 --> 03:58:48.560]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and
[03:58:48.560 --> 03:58:51.120]  said America is back.
[03:58:51.120 --> 03:58:56.440]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana
[03:58:56.440 --> 03:59:00.840]  are back in charge and the world is taking notice.
