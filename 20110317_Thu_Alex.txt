[00:00.000 --> 00:12.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.600 --> 00:21.400]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.400 --> 00:34.960]  we are live my friends it is thursday the 17th day of march 2011 we're gonna be
[00:34.960 --> 00:40.680]  here at least for the next three hours live now dr. dug rocky is undergoing
[00:40.680 --> 00:45.800]  medical treatment a nuclear physicist in his own right former head of the
[00:45.800 --> 00:52.040]  pentagon's du program and radiation testing safety program for the entire
[00:52.040 --> 00:56.160]  army but he wrote the pentagon program on du itself he was both the head of the
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.320]  pentagon program and the army program is unable to join us he should be able
[01:00.320 --> 01:05.440]  to join us next week he's had over 30 plus surgeries from du exposure he's
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.000]  there at the va hospital in dc you need to pray for him but he did give us his
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.160]  colleagues name a number who it turns out is one of the most prestigious people
[01:14.160 --> 01:21.320]  out there working and reporting for bbc you name it dr. chris busby will be
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.200]  joining us today and he's tracking the government and private radiation monitors
[01:26.200 --> 01:31.920]  in the pacific in the allusions in alaska and here in the united states the
[01:31.920 --> 01:35.320]  new york times did confirm that the united nations and federal government
[01:35.320 --> 01:41.400]  expect for radiation to make landfall sometime tomorrow in southern california
[01:41.400 --> 01:46.480]  the jet stream that will be like a snake winds around the earth the band that goes
[01:46.480 --> 01:52.120]  over japan moves between northern united states southern canada and southern
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.440]  california it moves back and forth the band that went over six days ago when
[01:57.440 --> 02:05.520]  the meltdowns began at fukushima complex again it's moving north and south back
[02:05.520 --> 02:11.600]  and forth that band that was over japan six days ago will now be reaching the
[02:11.600 --> 02:16.800]  united states tomorrow and coming in around southern california though it
[02:16.800 --> 02:22.360]  will then if it follows past forecast i will start moving north again over
[02:22.360 --> 02:31.440]  oregon washington state and southwestern canada but the lighter
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.200]  radiation was released in the first two days obviously friday and then into
[02:36.200 --> 02:41.280]  saturday and then fukushima one blew up obviously the big release was fukushima
[02:41.280 --> 02:44.200]  number three blowing sky high with hundreds of thousands of spent fuel
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.120]  rods stored on top the building ejected into the atmosphere that should be
[02:48.120 --> 02:54.720]  arriving sunday or monday and again we don't know where the jet stream will be
[02:54.720 --> 02:59.480]  exactly but it's forecast to move north at that point so the first radiation
[02:59.480 --> 03:04.760]  that's going to be hitting is forecast by the new york times to be light the
[03:04.760 --> 03:15.360]  problem is we reported on this yesterday cart nimo did it was some of the crew in
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.320]  there that pointed out that japan in the fukushima prefecture and surrounding
[03:20.320 --> 03:28.160]  states was and we'll show that map on screen was not repeat not reporting from
[03:28.160 --> 03:33.680]  the worst hit areas five days in there still not reporting will put that map
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.200]  up live time they're still not reporting in those key areas again most of us
[03:38.200 --> 03:42.200]  being blown out to see if you look south though you see the red area where they
[03:42.200 --> 03:46.800]  are reporting high levels of radiation but they're saying that they're under
[03:46.800 --> 03:54.040]  survey and still collating data from the fukushima area and north of there and we
[03:54.040 --> 03:59.560]  wrote the article governments corporations push cover-up of Japanese
[03:59.560 --> 04:05.640]  nuclear nightmare and a data map of radiation levels in japan posted by the
[04:05.640 --> 04:10.320]  target map website has omitted information from the fukushima prefecture
[04:10.320 --> 04:16.040]  that's the state where nuclear reactors are currently melting down now this
[04:16.040 --> 04:20.920]  morning we posted this yesterday afternoon when the show was still
[04:20.920 --> 04:25.200]  running not bragging I'm just showing we know what we're talking about here we
[04:25.200 --> 04:29.160]  are a very credible source of information not because we're smart but
[04:29.160 --> 04:32.920]  because we're not lying to you we're following historic nuclear fallout
[04:32.920 --> 04:40.120]  patterns cover-up patterns reportage patterns USA Today does report that
[04:40.120 --> 04:44.760]  Japanese government radiation report for the 47 states Wednesday had notable
[04:44.760 --> 04:49.040]  omission fukushima ground zero and the surrounding areas about a hundred
[04:49.040 --> 04:53.240]  kilometers in all areas there is a cover-up but the cover-up expands into
[04:53.240 --> 04:58.280]  our own government radiation set to make landfall in t-minus less than 24
[04:58.280 --> 05:04.760]  hours southern california a very wealthy u.s. citizen is predicting that in 2011
[05:04.760 --> 05:09.320]  we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years he says
[05:09.320 --> 05:13.040]  it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel invest

[05:16.240 --> 05:19.640]  family now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[05:19.640 --> 05:24.400]  the crazy part is he's usually right you see he predicted the collapse of GM
[05:24.400 --> 05:27.680]  panty may friday mack and america's biggest mall owner general growth
[05:27.680 --> 05:32.840]  properties in fact barons called his work a dire prophecy recently he created

[07:05.840 --> 07:10.400]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[07:10.400 --> 07:14.000]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.880]  have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[07:18.880 --> 07:23.640]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as american
[07:23.640 --> 07:28.000]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.280]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[08:05.920 --> 08:13.880]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[08:16.840 --> 08:23.440]  well the situation is deteriorating quickly obviously the new york times
[08:23.440 --> 08:30.160]  talking to multiple government sources the u.s. department of energy the
[08:30.160 --> 08:36.920]  international atomic energy agency at the united nations are all confirming that
[08:36.920 --> 08:43.160]  they expect radiation to hit the elution islands today and to hit southern
[08:43.160 --> 08:48.800]  california tomorrow now remember this is the radiation from fridays fukushima
[08:48.800 --> 08:54.720]  leak which did report moderate levels of three different isotopes strontium
[08:54.720 --> 09:02.560]  cesium and a radioactive isotope of iodine those are nothing they're very
[09:02.560 --> 09:08.240]  toxic very radioactive but nothing compared to uranium and plutonium from
[09:08.240 --> 09:12.400]  looking at it knowing that 600,000 plus rods were stored there when fukushima 1
[09:12.400 --> 09:18.480]  blew up saturday that radiation will be arriving a few days after the
[09:18.480 --> 09:23.360]  radiation from friday or as early as a day after we're talking about saturday
[09:23.360 --> 09:30.080]  the jet stream winds like a snake around the world but it's one stream the
[09:30.080 --> 09:34.520]  stream that goes directly over japan is the stream that moves north the south it
[09:34.520 --> 09:39.080]  varies in a weather pattern from southern california is as southerly as it
[09:39.080 --> 09:43.080]  generally goes sometimes it goes into northern mexico and then it goes as high
[09:43.080 --> 09:50.680]  as alaska it moves back and forth the band that was going over japan on friday
[09:50.680 --> 09:55.800]  when fukushima first was hit by the 9.1 earthquake and the tsunami that knocked
[09:55.800 --> 09:59.880]  out its diesel power and its emergency battery repower as well as its primary
[09:59.880 --> 10:06.560]  electrical power line power it was going over fukushima when it had leaks that
[10:06.560 --> 10:09.120]  are nothing compared to what's happened since then so that's the first
[10:09.120 --> 10:14.720]  radiation that's getting here weather forecast following past models believe
[10:14.720 --> 10:19.800]  that the jet stream will start moving in the next few days more northerly and
[10:19.800 --> 10:25.680]  that's bad news for oregon washington state and southern canada so it's gonna
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.600]  start moving now more to the north reportedly in the next few days after
[10:30.600 --> 10:34.920]  that first radiation reportedly makes landfall the mainstream media will seize
[10:34.920 --> 10:39.160]  on the low-level radiation readings tomorrow and say see no big deal not
[10:39.160 --> 10:46.000]  pointing out that the bigger explosions and the internal containment vessels got
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.360]  breached on monday tuesday wednesday through thursday with continual fires
[10:50.360 --> 10:55.160]  and explosions abc news reported the japanese government stated yesterday we
[10:55.160 --> 11:00.440]  read the quotes on air that the explosions and radiation is so high that
[11:00.440 --> 11:04.480]  they morally don't even want to send in the fukushima 50 who have said they're
[11:04.480 --> 11:12.520]  willing to die they have a hundred and eighty men in 50 person rotations going
[11:12.520 --> 11:16.320]  in it's also being reported by mainstream news we pointed out two days
[11:16.320 --> 11:22.000]  ago where are japanese robots the japanese are robot crazy where are the
[11:22.000 --> 11:26.160]  robots at fukushima well the truth is robots just can't get the job done at
[11:26.160 --> 11:31.040]  their current developmental stage that humans can though robots also have
[11:31.040 --> 11:36.440]  trouble operating in radiation as well so does camera equipment you name it and
[11:36.440 --> 11:41.680]  the radiation is obviously rising off the charts that's why on monday when
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.720]  fukushima 3 the plutonium based system blue sky high with hundreds of
[11:46.720 --> 11:50.880]  thousands of rods stored on top of the building ejected into the sky not just
[11:50.880 --> 11:54.840]  the containment area breached but those rods ejected into the sky that's when
[11:54.840 --> 12:00.880]  the USS ronald reagan hauled tail out of the area and us troops were ordered to
[12:00.880 --> 12:07.520]  pull back and not be involved in the relief effort now here is the key the
[12:07.520 --> 12:13.920]  japanese are covering up the radiation levels in the two prefectures or the
[12:13.920 --> 12:20.160]  states surrounding fukushima most the radiation from weather patterns is going
[12:20.160 --> 12:24.640]  out to see that's good for tokyo the winds changes for a few hours as you
[12:24.640 --> 12:29.880]  know on tuesday sparking millions to try to flee the 37 plus million metro area
[12:29.880 --> 12:32.720]  of tokyo then the winds changed tuesday night
[12:32.720 --> 12:40.120]  wednesday into today straight to the east out over the ocean with the jet
[12:40.120 --> 12:44.520]  stream going west to east directly towards the united states so the first
[12:44.520 --> 12:50.040]  radiation the new york times reports is set to be hitting the elution islands
[12:50.040 --> 12:55.680]  today and the southern west coast of the united states southern california
[12:55.680 --> 13:01.520]  tomorrow with the jet stream set as it moves up and down south to north on a
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.280]  daily basis to as the worst radiation comes in moving more towards the north
[13:06.280 --> 13:10.320]  or it may stay on southern california and that is one of the worst case
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.200]  scenarios reported on monday and tuesday by a meteorologist is that if that
[13:15.200 --> 13:23.520]  radiation comes in as you know with smog with the mountains to the east of
[13:23.520 --> 13:29.120]  san diego and los angeles in other areas that it will trap the radiation
[13:29.120 --> 13:37.120]  over the city if i lived as a precaution i personally if i lived in los angeles
[13:37.120 --> 13:41.680]  or in that area hemmed in by the mountains by the high desert where you
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.400]  have the jet stream that comes in and then builds up and then turns north
[13:46.400 --> 13:51.280]  there because of the mountains and runs up the mountain range i would calmly
[13:51.280 --> 13:58.800]  be heading southeast i would be going into arizona i would be going into texas
[13:58.800 --> 14:02.800]  i would be going into mississippi and louisiana i will be honest with the
[14:02.800 --> 14:08.000]  audience i am not leaving the united states
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.760]  but i don't sit here and take a government that covered up chair noble
[14:11.760 --> 14:15.040]  that covered up three-mile island when this clearly is now dwarfing it
[14:15.040 --> 14:19.440]  make no mistake there's been multiple total meltdowns fires in the reactors
[14:19.440 --> 14:23.680]  fuel rods 600 000 of them thrown every way you can imagine fires in every
[14:23.680 --> 14:28.160]  containment facility that place is a total nightmare
[14:28.160 --> 14:32.000]  and um what happens is you get moderate exposure
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.880]  and then your child who's eight years old gets leukemia when they're 18
[14:36.880 --> 14:40.000]  or your two-year-old gets leukemia when they're seven
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.080]  and we know uh and this is even in the new york times in associated press
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.680]  that an estimated one million people in the last 25 years have died
[14:49.680 --> 14:53.360]  from complications in europe from chair noble
[14:53.360 --> 14:57.600]  in an article that is extremely detailed and extremely important
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.160]  by paul joseph watson that must be gotten out to everyone
[15:02.160 --> 15:05.520]  us government cannot be trusted on radiation plume
[15:05.520 --> 15:11.360]  we have the animated government map uh of what happened
[15:11.360 --> 15:17.360]  in 1986 in europe and if you're a prison planet dot tv viewer
[15:17.360 --> 15:20.960]  we're going to be playing that video over the audio while i'm speaking here
[15:20.960 --> 15:25.120]  we'll start rolling that now showing what happened in the 10 days
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.800]  after chair noble as it went out of ukraine
[15:28.800 --> 15:32.720]  into northern europe into scandinavia turned back
[15:32.720 --> 15:36.320]  west over england over germany over france
[15:36.320 --> 15:42.560]  and then settling in over idly for six months the italian government i saw a
[15:42.560 --> 15:45.520]  comment in the news article i pulled it up it turned out it was true
[15:45.520 --> 15:48.880]  for six months in idly they only ate frozen food
[15:48.880 --> 15:54.880]  from the united states and asia they would not feed in the schools public and
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.920]  private by government order any fresh produce or milk
[15:59.920 --> 16:03.600]  products grown in europe and you can see the map on screen
[16:03.600 --> 16:10.640]  all of europe got a dose of it all of europe eastern europe and russia
[16:10.640 --> 16:14.320]  got massive dose and that is only over 10
[16:14.320 --> 16:18.400]  days it then circled the earth at measurable levels
[16:18.400 --> 16:22.640]  for another two years the red area you see is guaranteed
[16:22.640 --> 16:26.240]  death within a week to a year the orange area
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.320]  they're talking about decades taken off your life the yellow area
[16:30.320 --> 16:33.920]  many years taken off your life increased cancers
[16:33.920 --> 16:37.520]  just absolutely incredible what happened
[16:37.520 --> 16:44.400]  with chair noble now remember chair noble was a smaller plant
[16:44.400 --> 16:48.960]  that only had one explosion and then fires for a day
[16:48.960 --> 16:57.440]  and then another eight days of steam rising out of the
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.000]  reactor four the other reactors there did not explode
[17:02.000 --> 17:09.600]  and were not damaged one million dead in the 25 years since 1986
[17:09.600 --> 17:13.440]  one million dead i'm going to be honest with you
[17:13.440 --> 17:17.440]  i'm trying with we're talking to family right now trying to find somebody to go
[17:17.440 --> 17:20.560]  with my wife and children and leave the united states perhaps for a month
[17:20.560 --> 17:24.160]  but you know why because i know radiation i've studied it
[17:24.160 --> 17:26.560]  i know the government's going to tell us everything's fine
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.200]  and that those maps are going to be suppressed from the american people
[17:31.200 --> 17:34.240]  and we're not going to be told how bad it is and i'm not going to sit there
[17:34.240 --> 17:38.080]  and let my children huff uranium and plutonium and strontium
[17:38.080 --> 17:44.960]  and radioactive iodine and cesium so i'm going to stay here and report
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.240]  but i'm telling you right now i'm watching the weather patterns i'm going
[17:48.240 --> 17:51.440]  to watch what comes out from private
[17:51.440 --> 17:55.280]  radiation meters in california in washington
[17:55.280 --> 17:59.120]  in origan in southern
[17:59.360 --> 18:04.960]  areas of canada uh in alaska because some of the winds are also sending it up
[18:04.960 --> 18:10.720]  towards alaska uh in the allusions and i personally
[18:10.720 --> 18:16.560]  will send my family to the caribbean because i'm not going to sit here and
[18:16.560 --> 18:20.880]  have my little darlings huffing that stuff like the europeans did
[18:20.880 --> 18:24.640]  period period now it will blow over you'll get mixed in with
[18:24.640 --> 18:28.160]  sand and dirt and and and and and and and then
[18:28.160 --> 18:31.600]  tends to get diluted it's still radioactive for billions of years but
[18:31.600 --> 18:36.000]  you have less of a chance of breathing it but when rain hits in the next week
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.200]  across the united states after this radiation passes
[18:39.200 --> 18:42.320]  believe me folks you don't want to be out there running around the rain
[18:42.320 --> 18:45.760]  uh you don't want to get any of this on you because
[18:45.760 --> 18:49.280]  you it will increase your cancer risk exponentially
[18:49.280 --> 18:52.720]  and the government and the media is not going to tell you this i'll guarantee
[18:52.720 --> 18:56.160]  you that they're not going to tell american school children especially
[18:56.160 --> 18:59.520]  where it makes landfall in southern california with those mountains
[18:59.520 --> 19:03.360]  blocking it in to not eat the produce and drink the milk uh for a long
[19:03.360 --> 19:06.240]  period of time there's not going to be testing a milk
[19:06.240 --> 19:10.000]  or if they do it's going to be fake testing because the globalist
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.520]  have a long history especially in the u.s of covering everything up
[19:13.520 --> 19:17.200]  including three-mile island which was estimated a decade after
[19:17.200 --> 19:20.480]  in the early 1980s a decade after it happened in the early 1970s
[19:20.480 --> 19:25.760]  to be at least 100 times what they had said and that was on the east coast
[19:25.760 --> 19:30.160]  that blew out to sea most of that blew out to see
[19:30.160 --> 19:33.680]  okay what's happening in japan is blowing out to see
[19:33.680 --> 19:41.520]  directly towards us okay now four reactors have blown sky high
[19:41.520 --> 19:47.280]  600 000 rods are in a state of disarray ejected into the air on fire
[19:47.280 --> 19:52.000]  this is dwarfing chair noble conservatively
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.680]  dwarfing chair and many experts are now saying that dr bob bowman three days
[19:55.680 --> 19:58.480]  ago said this could easily dwarf chair noble i want to get him to pop back in
[19:58.480 --> 20:02.320]  today we do have a big expert coming on

[24:29.520 --> 24:33.520]  viewers for listeners who are radio listeners just go to info wars dot com
[24:33.520 --> 24:37.120]  the japanese government us say today is confirmed what we first reported
[24:37.120 --> 24:44.160]  yesterday is not repeat not reporting
[24:44.160 --> 24:49.600]  radiation levels from the two states surrounding fukushima with the four
[24:49.600 --> 24:53.360]  reactors that are in a state of total bedlam
[24:53.360 --> 24:56.240]  headline government corporations push cover-up
[24:56.240 --> 25:03.680]  of japanese nuclear nightmare continuing with this news the latest
[25:03.680 --> 25:10.000]  article at info wars dot com this morning pentagon cover-up of data on
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.400]  fukushima disaster it is not only the japanese that have
[25:14.400 --> 25:18.880]  detectors in that area the fleet is there the troops are at okinawa the
[25:18.880 --> 25:21.760]  troops there with with the nbc nuclear chemical
[25:21.760 --> 25:26.480]  biological detectors very high tech are in ceo and all over
[25:26.480 --> 25:30.800]  the pacific area we are now six plus days
[25:30.800 --> 25:34.320]  into this unfolding disaster six and a half
[25:34.320 --> 25:37.840]  days ago this began and we have been given nothing
[25:37.840 --> 25:42.160]  from fukushima that is blowing directly out to see
[25:42.160 --> 25:48.000]  do you understand the treason this is the same government that puts
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.840]  sodium flora in our water knowing it causes bone cancer
[25:51.840 --> 25:55.840]  that's seven times the rate for men three times for women
[25:55.840 --> 26:00.240]  this is the same government that rolls out gmo's that every other country
[26:00.240 --> 26:03.360]  refuses this is the same government that approves drugs
[26:03.360 --> 26:05.280]  on the market that other countries want to prove
[26:05.280 --> 26:10.720]  they could care less about us again the headline pentagon cover-up
[26:10.720 --> 26:14.880]  of data on fukushima disaster it is not only
[26:14.880 --> 26:18.320]  the japanese doing this as i told you yesterday
[26:18.320 --> 26:22.560]  government's corporations put cover-up of japanese nuclear disaster
[26:22.560 --> 26:26.400]  curtain emmo's article breaks down that our government the japanese
[26:26.400 --> 26:31.200]  government and others are covering this up they are not releasing the data
[26:31.200 --> 26:35.600]  you've had four reactors blow sky high 600 000 rods
[26:35.600 --> 26:39.760]  ejected all over the place fires going intensely
[26:39.760 --> 26:43.200]  since saturday intensifying monday tuesday
[26:43.200 --> 26:50.240]  wednesday today fires smoke continuing radioactive and now
[26:50.240 --> 26:55.280]  the u.s military this is the wall street journal at a glance u.s begins
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.240]  evacuations of japan the u.s department of state is authorized
[27:00.240 --> 27:03.120]  last night the voluntary evacuation of u.s dependence
[27:03.120 --> 27:06.880]  of u.s government personnel based in northeast japan as concerns mounted
[27:06.880 --> 27:10.000]  about the levels of radiation emerging and emanating from the stricken
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.680]  japanese nuclear reactors as of yesterday morning
[27:13.680 --> 27:17.440]  all the top experts said that if they don't contain this in 48 hours
[27:17.440 --> 27:20.480]  it will be worse than chair noble ladies and gentlemen it was worse than
[27:20.480 --> 27:24.000]  chair noble when the mark 1 fukushima 3 blew up in
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.600]  that big black mushroom cloud and ejected hundreds of thousands of fuel
[27:27.600 --> 27:31.920]  rods stored on the roof into the atmosphere
[27:31.920 --> 27:37.600]  okay and again new york times with quotes from department of energy and
[27:37.600 --> 27:40.480]  the united nations they expect radiation to hit the
[27:40.480 --> 27:42.560]  illusions we went and looked at the illusion island
[27:42.560 --> 27:45.440]  detectors says you got a register we can't get in
[27:45.440 --> 27:49.120]  we'll keep trying but they're expecting that today we know the
[27:49.120 --> 27:52.640]  government's clamping down on media and we saw that bizarre report out of
[27:52.640 --> 27:56.400]  alaska who would be one of the first to get it from some of the northerly winds
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.320]  that they had detected it in the article they said that they hadn't detected it
[28:00.320 --> 28:04.400]  we don't know what's going on and we're going to have to rely
[28:04.400 --> 28:08.000]  on the private detector sites uh that are out there
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.080]  and organizations that we're creating lists of to post at info wars dot com
[28:12.080 --> 28:15.440]  and prison planet dot com and that's the prime directive to all my writers
[28:15.440 --> 28:19.760]  right now listening start collating large lists because we link to just one as
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.720]  we've done it crashes them to all the private
[28:22.720 --> 28:26.240]  universities public universities private networks
[28:26.240 --> 28:30.160]  that are tracking radiation we are seeing youtube
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.680]  videos but we don't know if they're real the people in southern california
[28:33.680 --> 28:37.680]  already showing a doubling and normal background radiation
[28:37.680 --> 28:41.440]  from the tabletop units that are hooked in to internet networks
[28:41.440 --> 28:44.400]  that's also in paul joseph watson's article
[28:44.400 --> 28:48.720]  us government cannot be trusted on radiation plume
[28:48.720 --> 28:53.920]  and we'll put that article back on screen so you can see the u.s. say today
[28:53.920 --> 28:58.640]  Reuters slash graphic again u.s. today actually posted the new york times
[28:58.640 --> 29:04.320]  Reuters graphic radioactive plume radiation from crippled you mean blown up
[29:04.320 --> 29:08.960]  japanese reactors will be diluted as it travels across the pacific ocean and
[29:08.960 --> 29:12.320]  at worst would have extremely minor health consequences
[29:12.320 --> 29:15.920]  in the u.s the new york times reported on thursday
[29:15.920 --> 29:20.480]  well isn't that funny isn't that funny because that's what they always say they
[29:20.480 --> 29:24.000]  tell the troops there's no health effects from depleted uranium
[29:24.000 --> 29:28.240]  which we know has been devastating and a 12 to 15 times increase
[29:28.240 --> 29:32.080]  in cancers in cities like feluja in iraq where it's been used
[29:32.080 --> 29:37.920]  and it is child's play compared to live plutonium uranium and other isotopes
[29:37.920 --> 29:41.920]  splattered into the atmosphere so that's all coming up
[29:41.920 --> 29:44.480]  we're going to be breaking it all down there's also some type of leak at a
[29:44.480 --> 29:47.600]  reactor going on in canada that we mentioned yesterday
[29:47.600 --> 29:51.200]  there's more news on that will break down after the break
[29:51.200 --> 29:55.040]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:55.040 --> 30:00.000]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.800 --> 30:04.000]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.080]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[30:08.080 --> 30:11.760]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:11.760 --> 30:15.440]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[30:15.440 --> 30:19.680]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.680 --> 30:23.280]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[30:23.280 --> 30:27.760]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[30:27.760 --> 30:31.600]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[30:31.600 --> 30:34.800]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[30:34.800 --> 30:38.720]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[30:38.720 --> 30:42.560]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[30:42.560 --> 30:45.200]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[33:35.680 --> 33:42.880]  okay uh fox news is now reporting that the cooling has failed uh and the
[33:42.880 --> 33:46.640]  emergency efforts have failed at fukushima and they're now accelerating
[33:46.640 --> 33:50.160]  the evacuation area
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.000]  fox news is now reporting that japan quake us charters planes to help
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.680]  citizens leave again government corporations push cover
[33:59.680 --> 34:04.240]  up a japanese nuclear nightmare us today confirmed our report
[34:04.240 --> 34:07.520]  today that indeed the japanese are not releasing the real
[34:07.520 --> 34:11.440]  radiation levels for several hundred mile
[34:11.440 --> 34:15.840]  circumference around fukushima disaster site
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.320]  we have all of those reports we also have the star out of canada reporting
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.440]  that there is a
[34:25.440 --> 34:28.880]  demineralized water leak from the pickering nuclear station
[34:28.880 --> 34:34.400]  they're saying it's no threat uh up in canada pickering nuclear plant leaked
[34:34.400 --> 34:38.480]  radioactive water is the afp headline thousands of leaders of radioactive
[34:38.480 --> 34:40.960]  water have been released to lake ontario
[34:40.960 --> 34:44.240]  as a result of an accident a canadian nuclear power plant according to
[34:44.240 --> 34:49.040]  authorities the event was a low-level regulatory event oh since they said
[34:49.040 --> 34:52.880]  regulatory it's okay with only negligible effect to the
[34:52.880 --> 34:55.920]  environment and no public health implications ontario power
[34:55.920 --> 35:00.160]  said in a statement uh so just like they said at three mile island
[35:00.160 --> 35:05.840]  uh same type of garbage uh on that front
[35:05.840 --> 35:10.160]  uh going back to japan we are watching the situation the plants closely
[35:10.160 --> 35:14.480]  said daniel poneman the u.s deputy secretary of energy and announcing the
[35:14.480 --> 35:17.440]  evacuation directive u.s officials said the
[35:17.440 --> 35:20.800]  dependence of u.s defense department officials
[35:20.800 --> 35:23.760]  based in japan's northeast would also follow the state department's
[35:23.760 --> 35:26.640]  authorization concerning the evacuation of dependence earlier
[35:26.640 --> 35:30.400]  wednesday the obama administration recommended the evacuation of all american
[35:30.400 --> 35:33.360]  citizens get me that fox news headline you told me about on screen because i
[35:33.360 --> 35:37.520]  don't have that thank you so much um
[35:37.520 --> 35:42.480]  we do have a dr christ busby uh joining us as a british scientist and activist
[35:42.480 --> 35:45.360]  known for his work on the health effects of ionizing radiation
[35:45.360 --> 35:49.680]  addition to his academic appointments uh busby was the national speaker of the
[35:49.680 --> 35:52.880]  science technology and the scientific secretary of the european
[35:52.880 --> 35:56.960]  committee on radiation risk uh he's a uh
[35:56.960 --> 36:03.600]  chemist and uh he will be joining us he's also as a phd uh from the
[36:03.600 --> 36:09.360]  university of kent and researching um ramen spectro electrochemistry or
[36:09.360 --> 36:13.360]  dealing with the effects of radiation so he's a radiation poisoning specialist
[36:13.360 --> 36:18.640]  in chemistry and radiology uh he will be joining us
[36:18.640 --> 36:21.840]  he's also one of the advisors uh to the bbc
[36:21.840 --> 36:25.760]  on nuclear power plant uh accidents and incidents
[36:25.760 --> 36:29.680]  he'll be he'll be joining us uh coming up
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.200]  right before i went live for this latest segment i was given
[36:33.200 --> 36:37.600]  some bombshell news and information uh dealing with
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.440]  fox reporting that the cooling has failed in the emergency effort
[36:41.440 --> 36:44.240]  so maybe we should just go to the front page of fox
[36:44.240 --> 36:48.240]  news to uh to see that information right now
[36:48.240 --> 36:52.160]  because i was given that two seconds before i i walked in here and
[36:52.160 --> 36:56.240]  actually catching my breath dealing with that information
[36:56.240 --> 37:00.320]  right now but we'll continue to collate all this information
[37:00.320 --> 37:07.920]  and post it at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[37:07.920 --> 37:12.640]  there's also a lot of other news on the economic front uh there's also a lot of
[37:12.640 --> 37:15.600]  u.s news and uh middle east news we're gonna be
[37:15.600 --> 37:19.120]  breaking down uh there's the headline confusion over
[37:19.120 --> 37:23.120]  nuke cooling mission uh and it says photos give an
[37:23.120 --> 37:26.400]  inside look of the crippled nuclear plant as japanese officials
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.080]  appear at odds over weather helicopter and water cannon dumps
[37:30.080 --> 37:33.680]  on the earthquake ravage facilities have been effective
[37:33.680 --> 37:37.280]  here's the headline japanese officials at odds of water dumps have
[37:37.280 --> 37:41.040]  uh crippled nuclear plant japanese officials are at odds of whether the
[37:41.040 --> 37:44.720]  water dumps on the crippled fukushima niachi nuclear plant
[37:44.720 --> 37:49.440]  today has worked as high radiation levels have been detected 19 miles away
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.600]  remember most of it's blowing out to sea towards us in the united states and
[37:53.600 --> 37:56.560]  canada a spokesman for the tokyo electric power
[37:56.560 --> 38:00.800]  company told japan news agency nhk that it appears the mission was
[38:00.800 --> 38:04.720]  successful all the spokesman for the nuclear and industrial safety agency
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.160]  says the water cannons failed in their attempt to cool the unit
[38:08.160 --> 38:12.400]  there's still reports of smoke and fire uh when the water failed to reach its
[38:12.400 --> 38:16.400]  target from safe distances japanese military helicopters dumped water
[38:16.400 --> 38:19.840]  onto the crippled fukushima niachi nuclear plant i mean when they pump sea
[38:19.840 --> 38:22.560]  water in that didn't work with masses amount of it
[38:22.560 --> 38:26.160]  little helicopter dumps i don't think it's gonna work i hope it does
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.160]  they went on to say crews tried unsuccessfully to douse the reactors
[38:30.160 --> 38:34.240]  with water an official from the tokyo electric power company told japan news
[38:34.240 --> 38:37.520]  that there is a greater possibility they will be able to fill the spin fuel rod
[38:37.520 --> 38:42.480]  pool from unit three reactor the pool requires 1200 tons of water
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.680]  to be filled but the power company official says you only need one third of
[38:45.680 --> 38:49.440]  the amount to cover the spin fuel rods but what about the hundreds of thousands
[38:49.440 --> 38:53.440]  splattered everywhere from the explosion they're covering up the
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.680]  radiation levels our supposed military that's
[38:57.680 --> 39:00.800]  really there to guard the foreign banks when they loot us and rob us and take
[39:00.800 --> 39:03.840]  our pension funds and to suppress the states
[39:03.840 --> 39:06.720]  under the john warren defense authorization act if we try to take the
[39:06.720 --> 39:10.480]  country back legally and lawfully and constitutionally
[39:10.480 --> 39:14.320]  they're not telling us what the radiation levels are not
[39:14.320 --> 39:18.720]  just the japanese government not just tokyo
[39:18.720 --> 39:25.200]  power and electric they are not telling us i called congress yesterday i called
[39:25.200 --> 39:29.360]  the winehouse i was hung up on they don't want to hear it
[39:29.360 --> 39:32.640]  all i'm hearing about on our news is march madness
[39:32.640 --> 39:36.800]  as six days of radiation clouds make their way
[39:36.800 --> 39:40.240]  the first stuff that's going to hit us is from the small leaks friday
[39:40.240 --> 39:43.360]  not the explosion saturday at fukushima one
[39:43.360 --> 39:47.360]  not the explosion monday at fukushima three not the explosions
[39:47.360 --> 39:52.400]  on tuesday at fukushima two and four not the spent fuel rods splattered into
[39:52.400 --> 39:57.200]  the atmosphere do you read me and i've sent the twitter question
[39:57.200 --> 40:00.640]  out twitter.com forward slash real alex jones you want to follow us there
[40:00.640 --> 40:04.960]  or send us any intel i've read the mainstream news articles on
[40:04.960 --> 40:07.840]  air where meteorologists were particularly worried of the jet stream
[40:07.840 --> 40:10.640]  happened to be coming in at the time when the radiation reaches the u.s in
[40:10.640 --> 40:14.400]  southern california in the la area where the mountains
[40:14.400 --> 40:17.920]  block if you look at the normal activity of that jet stream coming in
[40:17.920 --> 40:22.640]  where the jet stream bands around over japan to the u.s
[40:22.640 --> 40:27.040]  it hits southern california and turns up and runs up the coast because the
[40:27.040 --> 40:30.880]  mountains block it it comes in on a high altitude and lowers down
[40:30.880 --> 40:34.880]  to about 10 000 feet and meteorologists have pointed out and radiologists that
[40:34.880 --> 40:39.360]  it will dump in and will concentrate over los angeles now
[40:39.360 --> 40:43.120]  i said that days ago our guests said that days ago
[40:43.120 --> 40:49.520]  now ladies and gentlemen usa today and the new york times are both reporting
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.600]  exactly what we said but with this background statement
[40:53.600 --> 40:57.200]  of you don't need potassium iodate and people being blocked from getting it
[40:57.200 --> 41:00.720]  when it does cover you with one of the number one things thrown off by these
[41:00.720 --> 41:03.520]  reactors what we know has been released in massive amounts
[41:03.520 --> 41:08.000]  radioactive iodine coming up in 20 minutes we have a top
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.560]  radiation poisoning expert joining us great job by the way to the crew for
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.800]  getting that information here's what some of the twitter
[41:16.800 --> 41:23.200]  commenters are saying oda i1011 says i
[41:23.200 --> 41:26.400]  would definitely evacuate southern california
[41:26.400 --> 41:29.440]  david handby says in the next few days southern california
[41:29.440 --> 41:33.680]  will become a very bad bad place to be but see they almost make it like it's
[41:33.680 --> 41:36.800]  kooky to warn people should i even call charlie sheen up people i know in la
[41:36.800 --> 41:39.280]  and tell them about the news i'm sure they're already reading info wars in
[41:39.280 --> 41:42.080]  prison planet have a talk to them in a few days
[41:42.080 --> 41:45.440]  in the next few days southern california be a very bad place to be
[41:45.440 --> 41:51.520]  another one from poblo go uh goera i think you're overreacting alex japan is
[41:51.520 --> 41:55.360]  way too far away from california well sir go to poll
[41:55.360 --> 42:01.360]  joseph watson's article u.s government cannot be trusted on radiation plume
[42:01.360 --> 42:04.880]  with a government released graph years ago
[42:04.880 --> 42:09.280]  of what radiation detectors picked up in just the 10 days after chair noble
[42:09.280 --> 42:13.120]  all of western europe much of eastern europe and russia
[42:13.120 --> 42:19.200]  covered there is the new york times slash reuters
[42:19.200 --> 42:25.440]  graphic put together with information by the u.s weather service
[42:25.440 --> 42:28.960]  the department of energy and the united nations
[42:28.960 --> 42:35.040]  and you see the plume reaching with orange level orange level the highest
[42:35.040 --> 42:38.000]  is red then orange it's got a graph of the
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.560]  rads there in fact roll down so i can read it please
[42:40.560 --> 42:43.040]  actually have it printed out in front of me thank you
[42:43.040 --> 42:51.520]  um relative levels of radiation red being high and dangerous
[42:51.520 --> 42:54.880]  orange being somewhat dangerous with long-term exposure
[42:54.880 --> 42:59.840]  uh yellow being moderate increases but not considered overall
[42:59.840 --> 43:06.000]  to be extremely life-threatening now there you see orange and
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.680]  the darker yellow hitting southern california with an orange blob right
[43:11.680 --> 43:15.120]  over los angeles why did the meteorologists say that
[43:15.120 --> 43:18.720]  because they've done pollution test over and over again
[43:18.720 --> 43:21.760]  from the stuff that comes out of chinese and japanese
[43:21.760 --> 43:26.320]  coal powered plants and other systems and there's been big complaints about the
[43:26.320 --> 43:29.760]  fact that they don't have scrubbers in china same jet stream goes over china
[43:29.760 --> 43:32.480]  than japan and they're always picking up high levels
[43:32.480 --> 43:35.760]  of lead arctic other things from the dirty coal plants
[43:35.760 --> 43:39.680]  hitting and building up it comes in out of the pacific and hits those mountains
[43:39.680 --> 43:45.440]  and dumps into la everybody knows that there's the new york times
[43:45.440 --> 43:51.200]  roiders graphic an orange dot directly over los angeles
[43:51.200 --> 43:55.760]  and they then show it going on in to the rockies and over colorado
[43:55.760 --> 43:59.520]  i watch the jet stream live time and satellite feeds we've shown them to you
[43:59.520 --> 44:02.160]  here and generally it hits and turns up the
[44:02.160 --> 44:06.000]  coast running up that mountain range into canada so i don't know why they're
[44:06.000 --> 44:10.160]  showing that uh to me it doesn't but i i'm not going to argue with their
[44:10.160 --> 44:15.760]  meteorologists the point is that okay i'm overreacting you
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.120]  know what i'll tell you something paul goerra fuster
[44:19.120 --> 44:23.600]  i hope that you are a hundred percent right please please be right sir i
[44:23.600 --> 44:27.040]  i hope i'm wrong i hope us today's wrong i hope roiders is wrong
[44:27.040 --> 44:31.120]  i hope the new york times is wrong okay the fact is they've been whitewashing
[44:31.120 --> 44:34.720]  how bad this is and the pentagons got readings out to see that's why the
[44:34.720 --> 44:37.760]  aircraft carriers raced away monday when the mark one fukushima
[44:37.760 --> 44:42.400]  number three blew up here's another one i would
[44:42.400 --> 44:48.000]  start a plan to stay out of on the other side of the rockies for a bit
[44:48.000 --> 44:55.280]  that is uh west of the rockies with that radiation coming in uh from the east
[44:55.280 --> 44:58.640]  to the west look i don't know what to say at this point
[44:58.640 --> 45:02.400]  um i love my children i try to do everything i can for them i don't want
[45:02.400 --> 45:07.040]  them to be gone for two three weeks but i've looked at maps
[45:07.040 --> 45:11.120]  southern caribbean's the place to be i don't want to send my wife alone with
[45:11.120 --> 45:14.000]  my children i've got to try to wrangle up somebody in
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.360]  the family that wants to go with them and chaperone them and help them
[45:17.360 --> 45:22.080]  uh i'm going to stay here and i haven't decided to do this yet
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.240]  i don't have much time though friday saturday as the first radiation that
[45:26.240 --> 45:31.680]  was limited from friday hits uh they forecast to try to gauge it
[45:31.680 --> 45:35.600]  but we know what's coming from saturday and sunday
[45:35.600 --> 45:39.600]  and monday and tuesday and wednesday and thursday and friday it just keeps
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.840]  on a coming they estimate that for 10 days there was off gassing from
[45:43.840 --> 45:48.320]  chernobyl one million people the new york times estimates
[45:48.320 --> 45:52.640]  from the un and the e u monitors have died from cancers
[45:52.640 --> 45:58.720]  and leukemias associated with this how will i feel 20 years from now if one or
[45:58.720 --> 46:01.840]  more of my children and because of the us at 300 above
[46:01.840 --> 46:05.440]  ground the rest of the country is about 200 it's over 500 combined according to
[46:05.440 --> 46:09.360]  the encyclopedia according to los alamos laboratory
[46:09.360 --> 46:14.880]  uh why do you think cancer has gone up so much since they did that but a nuke
[46:14.880 --> 46:22.240]  dissipates a lot of its radioactive isotopes a reactor is far worse and
[46:22.240 --> 46:25.520]  people are saying hey japan's thousands of miles away
[46:25.520 --> 46:30.000]  don't you understand that they've had plants blowing up sky high
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.560]  three thousand feet or more and then drifting tens of thousands of feet on
[46:34.560 --> 46:40.160]  the news out to see smoking now for six days
[46:40.160 --> 46:44.160]  towards us don't you understand that they i told everybody
[46:44.160 --> 46:48.480]  on 9 11 the news said there's nothing wrong with the dust it's safe
[46:48.480 --> 46:56.000]  on 9 12 2001 9 13 the head of the epa christina Todd Whitman came out and
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.760]  said the air is safe to breathe we've done the test now it turned out
[46:59.760 --> 47:04.000]  three years later it got released via lawsuits that they knew it was deadly
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.800]  that she said we've got to tell people to stay out of here for months and they
[47:06.800 --> 47:09.840]  said no we're opening the schools we're opening the stock market
[47:09.840 --> 47:13.120]  and i remember going on air that day in the day after and saying don't listen to
[47:13.120 --> 47:17.040]  them you've got to have breathing apparatus asbestos lead mercury
[47:17.040 --> 47:22.000]  arsenic all that stuff and i got laughed at and i'm being laughed at again
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.560]  it's so funny to laugh at me it's so funny to say
[47:26.560 --> 47:31.040]  i can't see any radiation it's not going to reach here
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.520]  for the last six days shut up alex it doesn't come across the pacific ocean
[47:35.520 --> 47:39.040]  now the media and the government are having to cover their butts
[47:39.040 --> 47:43.680]  their hind ends and they're saying yes some is going to get here probably
[47:43.680 --> 47:48.000]  tomorrow on the west coast coming in in southern california
[47:48.000 --> 47:53.280]  is first place it's going to make landfall but it's not a problem
[47:53.280 --> 48:01.040]  here's more twitter comments this is by uh kittens
[48:01.040 --> 48:06.000]  tasty i would leave california
[48:06.000 --> 48:14.080]  indy ne id w a that's washington heck even the northeast coast uh here's gaol
[48:14.080 --> 48:20.240]  says i'm in santa cruz california and i would have i could
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.640]  here's another one from don braxton hundred percent yes i've worn my friends
[48:24.640 --> 48:28.960]  there and they just laughed they can't say they weren't warned
[48:28.960 --> 48:34.560]  alex if you are stuck in los angeles what would you recommend stay indoors
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.240]  stay out of the rain absolutely that's just just go
[48:38.240 --> 48:41.680]  search the term we got a top radiation expert about to join us
[48:41.680 --> 48:45.200]  with normal precautions but you'd seal up your windows
[48:45.200 --> 48:49.520]  you'd go ahead now and change today all the filters in your air conditioning
[48:49.520 --> 48:54.800]  system not even though it won't be on still it's coming in from the outside
[48:54.800 --> 48:59.040]  that's a system that's got off vents to the outside i would close your doors
[48:59.040 --> 49:02.080]  when this stuff makes landfall hope it blows over because see it's when it's
[49:02.080 --> 49:05.280]  coming in it's so dangerous once it hits the dirt it gets diluted you still got
[49:05.280 --> 49:08.480]  a chance of breathing it later but it's it's a lot lower chance
[49:08.480 --> 49:12.800]  it's when it's coming in you're outside in southern california when this makes
[49:12.800 --> 49:15.920]  landfall or on the west coast period it's splattered all over because the winds
[49:15.920 --> 49:22.160]  are blowing to the north east uh east southeast then back to east now so it's
[49:22.160 --> 49:27.840]  going to be just shooting all over the pacific towards the united states if i'm
[49:27.840 --> 49:32.880]  standing here at fukushima looking out east towards the united states
[49:32.880 --> 49:39.680]  western seaboard and the lower 48 the wind was first going to the north
[49:39.680 --> 49:43.040]  then it was going straight east then it was going southeast it's now been for
[49:43.040 --> 49:47.520]  two days back east it's just blowing blowing blowing blowing
[49:47.520 --> 49:52.160]  blowing blowing blowing we had just smoke going up full of
[49:52.160 --> 49:57.280]  radiation up into the sky admitted high levels but they won't say how high
[49:57.280 --> 50:00.000]  we've gotten reports from on aircraft carriers that
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  monday when fukushima one three blew up that the detectors just went off the
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.800]  charts but the pentagon's not releasing that they're not
[50:06.800 --> 50:10.240]  telling us exactly what's coming our way they're not telling us how to take
[50:10.240 --> 50:13.280]  precautions they're saying radiation's coming because they know private
[50:13.280 --> 50:18.800]  detectors are going to pick it up and so they're saying don't worry about it
[50:18.800 --> 50:22.480]  go out enjoy yourself have a great day and yes if it rains
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.240]  friday saturday sunday monday tuesday wednesday into next week
[50:26.240 --> 50:29.120]  as long as these things burn as long as they explode
[50:29.120 --> 50:31.920]  as long as the meltdowns continue and they say the big meltdowns could be
[50:31.920 --> 50:34.560]  coming the total meltdowns of the contained cores
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.080]  two of which have already been breached they say who knows what's going on
[50:38.080 --> 50:41.360]  what they admit is horrible
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.760]  that makes me mad to sit here and watch how we've been trained to live in denial

[53:04.960 --> 53:07.600]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic
[53:07.600 --> 53:09.920]  circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[53:09.920 --> 53:13.040]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold
[53:13.040 --> 53:16.320]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[53:16.320 --> 53:18.640]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[53:18.640 --> 53:22.400]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[53:22.400 --> 53:26.160]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[53:26.160 --> 53:29.840]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[53:29.840 --> 53:33.120]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[53:33.120 --> 53:37.040]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a

[54:15.520 --> 54:19.280]  the associated press has been reporting since last night
[54:19.280 --> 54:24.960]  that nbc reporters including one of their anchors has tested positive for
[54:24.960 --> 54:29.200]  radiation bloomberg is reporting and we're going to get this
[54:29.200 --> 54:32.160]  up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[54:32.160 --> 54:38.400]  tokyo passengers trigger u.s airport detectors new york post is reporting
[54:38.400 --> 54:42.560]  radiation detectors at dallas fort worth and chicago hair remember the
[54:42.560 --> 54:46.240]  military's worried about their personnel coming back this stuff so radioactive
[54:46.240 --> 54:50.880]  that they're carrying it on them this is this is a huge disaster
[54:50.880 --> 54:56.320]  600 000 rods blown sky high in every direction on fire
[54:56.320 --> 55:03.520]  okay all blowing out towards us but they'll tell you everything's fine
[55:03.520 --> 55:06.880]  radiation detectors at dallas fort worth and chicago hair airports
[55:06.880 --> 55:10.320]  were triggered when passengers from flights that started in tokyo passed
[55:10.320 --> 55:13.520]  through customs the new york post reported they got nuke
[55:13.520 --> 55:16.800]  detectors in there tests at the dallas fort worth
[55:16.800 --> 55:20.320]  indicated low-level radiation and travelers just like the tsa told you
[55:20.320 --> 55:23.920]  the scanners were low-level it turns out they lied us today less variety
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.520]  luggage so passengers luggage and the aircraft's cabin
[55:27.520 --> 55:32.320]  filtration systems no passengers were quarantined the newspaper said yeah just
[55:32.320 --> 55:36.000]  we're not gonna they got all these multi-billion dollar containment systems
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.760]  they have these public fear mongering events where they do terror drills and
[55:39.760 --> 55:43.600]  everybody go out and get washed by the scrubbers to get the radiation off of
[55:43.600 --> 55:46.720]  them but oh you actually have radiation oh the plane has it
[55:46.720 --> 55:50.400]  oh your luggage you're going through with it we're not going to confiscate your
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.280]  luggage and do you favor so you don't kill your

[55:57.440 --> 56:01.680]  go on through with it yeah when there's an actual real threat
[56:01.680 --> 56:05.120]  what does government do nothing it's all about fear mongering with things that
[56:05.120 --> 56:08.880]  aren't a threat to train you to do whatever they say
[56:08.880 --> 56:12.480]  tested Dallas fourth worth indicated low-level radiation and travelers
[56:12.480 --> 56:15.520]  luggage and the aircraft's cabin filtration system
[56:15.520 --> 56:18.400]  no passengers were quarantined the newspaper said what do you want to bet
[56:18.400 --> 56:22.160]  they put new passengers on those planes i'll take right back off don't want to

[56:51.280 --> 56:53.680]  statement about why the pentagon hasn't released
[56:53.680 --> 56:57.600]  all the radiation monitor information from ships and bases in the area
[56:57.600 --> 57:00.880]  and aircraft we know been flying through it they lied yesterday and said a
[57:00.880 --> 57:05.440]  spy plane might fly through it today and and and get some heat
[57:05.440 --> 57:10.320]  signature photos to find out what's going on
[57:10.320 --> 57:15.280]  this is absolutely incredible this is absolutely amazing that this is all
[57:15.280 --> 57:18.000]  going on listeners have asked us to try to secure the
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.840]  medical grade potassium iodate we have found a source that it turns out i've
[57:21.840 --> 57:25.120]  known for more than a decade here in texas and my
[57:25.120 --> 57:28.720]  folks are dispatched there now to try to get a large amount of it the place is
[57:28.720 --> 57:31.600]  small it's a big outfit but they've been swamped by
[57:31.600 --> 57:34.320]  so many calls and online orders that they can't even
[57:34.320 --> 57:36.720]  fulfill it so we're gonna try to team up with them and help them
[57:36.720 --> 57:41.120]  we do have uh as our nutritionist and pharmacist have said
[57:41.120 --> 57:45.120]  the regular seaweed kelp based system that doesn't give you the mega dose but
[57:45.120 --> 57:48.560]  gives you a good dose to give some partial uh protection
[57:48.560 --> 57:52.560]  to fill up the thyroid those are available at info wars team calm
[57:52.560 --> 57:55.840]  but i can't even say if we get the medical grade stuff that you should
[57:55.840 --> 57:58.640]  take it read the insert that's up to you to make
[57:58.640 --> 58:02.080]  the decision because it does have some side effects on its own and some people
[58:02.080 --> 58:05.360]  are allergic to iodine but you know if you're allergic to iodine as you eat
[58:05.360 --> 58:08.560]  fish you get sick there's a lot of other ways to get high
[58:08.560 --> 58:11.120]  levels of iodine shellfish and things like that
[58:11.120 --> 58:14.400]  i'm not going to tell you what to do i know what i'm doing
[58:14.400 --> 58:17.520]  um so we're working on all of that as well we're gonna go ahead and get that

[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.760]  similar to what we heard in 86 from chair noble or from in the 70s with
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.760]  three-mile island uh dr busby thank you for joining us
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.400]  yes uh hello we've only got about four minutes in this segment but but what
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.080]  what is most important from your expertise that we should know
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.680]  well the radiation from this plant we don't know exactly how much there is
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.080]  we've been crossing the the uh the plumes from the from the various
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.440]  releases uh very hard to know how much is being released but
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.040]  it's almost certain that the uh in my opinion that the
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.680]  some of the pressure vessels at least have been have been
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.120]  breached and radio nuclei will have been coming out
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.960]  and there's also the other extremely serious problem is that there's over a
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.400]  thousand tons of mixed uranium and plutonium
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.160]  spent fuel in ponds uh which normally where they're
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.480]  stored just to keep them from heating up and these ponds seem to have become
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.160]  breached and the water's come out so that smoke that you see coming off
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.360]  in the photograph right in the pictures from the reactor that smoke
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.120]  is probably radioactivity um pure radioactive particles
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.040]  boiling out of these uh out of these spent fuel ponds and we've got a thousand
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.000]  that we've got over a thousand tons of material there
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.240]  I'm told by my informants um which which was being stored there but should
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.840]  really have been taken to a particular facility so that's the most dangerous
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.960]  thing well anyway the stuff kind of is coming is
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.040]  presently being released and it is contaminating the
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.240]  north island of Japan there's no question about that we've been picking
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.840]  up um signals of increased radioactivity
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.640]  from Tokyo um now the problem is this that the radioactivity measurements do
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.640]  not actually basically uh um show the amount of radioactivity
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.120]  there because an awful lot of the material coming out the radio new
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.920]  cars coming out don't aren't detected by ordinary gamma
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.400]  radiation measuring equipment like geiger counters so particles of plutonium
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.600]  for example and there is plutonium in these ponds these particles cannot be
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.360]  detected by geiger counters they're pure alpha emitters and that's what dr
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.520]  bowman did by geiger counters is uh an isotope of hydrogen called tritium of
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.360]  which there'll be a huge amount they're flooding these reactors with water
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.720]  and the material is being washed out by the water into the atmosphere and tritium
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.200]  is a form of radioactive water with a half life of about 12 years
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.440]  and also there'll be another isotope called carbon 14 so various isotopes
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.720]  that just do not get detected by geiger counters so if you get a small
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.480]  signal on a geiger counter it's not it's not fair as they have
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.160]  been to compare that to natural background radiation
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.400]  there's a lot of invisible stuff there well you know all this stuff is invisible
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.680]  so what's going to happen is it's going to if nothing gets worse
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.520]  there'll be just continuous releases of radioactivity from these uh
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.760]  from the from the fuel ponds and from the reactors themselves and when the wind
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.480]  and of course you know the wind is generally westerly although it will
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.160]  be moving around a lot the plumes will eventually come across
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.640]  america and then it will come across the atlantic and
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:16.560]  come across to europe and like chinovel they will go all around the world
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.680]  circulation the concentrations at the moment probably won't be
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.560]  enormously high but they will certainly cause an effect
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.400]  and the reason and the most important thing you need to know is that is that
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:30.160]  when they say when the authorities say that these levels of radioactivity
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.680]  don't cause harm that is a lie that is absolutely untrue
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.680]  doctor doctor we've got a break stay there only to recap and repeat all that
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.040]  talk about some of the other isotopes that are being released that's what
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.080]  dr bob bowman said three days ago is that
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.080]  geiger counters only pick up a certain spectrum of this
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.840]  and we also know the japanese usa today has confirmed are covering up
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.000]  the true radiation readings uh just with the regular geiger counters
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.360]  and so the pentagon also has assets there they're covering up as well
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.440]  when you're out on the road the last place you want to be
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:11.760]  is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.200]  diamond gussets there's a place down in tennessee
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.920]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:30.320]  they so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.040]  and put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:42.240]  blue diamond gussets got it others don't we turn jeans inside out
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.880]  diamond gusset jeans made in the usa with unparalleled quality
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.120]  our defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with kevlar protection
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.040]  so you can ride all day with confidence order yours at gusset
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:00.560]  dot com diamond gusset jeans got it others don't
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.760]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.760]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.200]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.440]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.520]  grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.440]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.560]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.480]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:41.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.480]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:14.800]  thank you ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.520]  professor christopher buzzby comes highly recommended by dr
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:39.520]  dug rocky who literally wrote the book for the pentagon on du effects
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.240]  and he is a professor a doctor of chemical physics he is one of the
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:48.880]  leading experts in the world in studying the
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.800]  effects of radiation exposure fallout he's one of the chief advisors
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.400]  there for the bbc for his assessment of the radiation danger
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:02.240]  following the earthquake tsunami in japan he joins us for the next
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.960]  40 minutes and if you missed the last segment
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.640]  he was talking about tritium being the number one thing
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.520]  that history shows is going to be released from
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.080]  this facility and that normal detectors do not pick this up so sir
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.920]  let's start from the beginning do you believe there's a cover-up
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.360]  explosions the 600 000 spent fuel rods stored there
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.400]  on top of the facilities the the reactor number three the mark one mox
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.520]  plutonium uranium based reactor ejecting
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.320]  rods into the air three thousand feet that's on record
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.840]  the japanese admit two of the internal containment live reactors
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.760]  have been breached we're getting lots of conflicting reports
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.360]  and the pentagon who's got assets all over the island
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.240]  all over the pacific all over south korea uh is not giving us any data
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.560]  usa today confirms that japan is not releasing the radiation
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.400]  readings from two of the regions or the states
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.960]  uh the the the prefectories as they call them
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.200]  uh so so please cover that spectrum first then let's get into the fallout
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.720]  uh and the fact that a lot of this cannot be easily
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.880]  measured does the government then have that's a lot of questions have systems
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.760]  to be able to measure that right that's rather a lot of things but i'll try and
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.560]  cover those the late professor john guffman who was an advisor to the atomic
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.520]  energy commission in america a very senior man said in the 1980s that the
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.600]  that the america the nuclear industry is waging a war against humanity
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.760]  what what and this is this is this is another battle in that war it's a
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.320]  battle for the truth after chenobal there was a consistent and
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.600]  continuous attempt to cover up the effects of chenobal and this is still
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.600]  ongoing the international atomic energy agency took control of the world
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.520]  health organization in order to cover up the effects of chenobal and they still
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.800]  are doing that and you see the international atomic energy agency
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.200]  talking down this accident at fukushima which is absolutely appalling it's a
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.320]  catastrophe uh the material coming out of the fukushima
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.920]  site can be measured i mean many many colleagues of mine
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.120]  are measuring increased radioactivity as far away as
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:19.680]  tokyo and and which is some 150 kilometers south and we have been plotting
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.960]  using the supercomputer of the noaa in america
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.880]  uh where where these materials from the part have been going from the beginning
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.840]  and and the the plots uh agree with the measurements of radioactivity
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.480]  that we have been finding in various parts of japan reported now the problem
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.280]  is this but this these materials um about about half of the material coming
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.120]  out of that part is undetectable with a geiger counter so if you get a slight
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.280]  increase in tokyo and it says there's four times natural background what
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.840]  happens is that the nuclear industry um spooches and the iaa and and the people
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.040]  who are trying to cover up the fear is they prey on ignorance
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.680]  they what they do is they say that this is um but this is acceptable because the
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.400]  limits are are are acceptable under the current risk model but what you have to
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.320]  realize is that the current risk model is just completely wrong it relates to
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:13.600]  external radiation exposure like standing in front of the
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.280]  outside in the sun or being x-rayed or whatever but it doesn't relate to
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.800]  internal radiation and i'm sure you know from what Doug Rocky has been
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.200]  telling you that it's the internal radiation effects of uranium particles
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.000]  which are which are responsible for all these terrible things that are
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.400]  happening in iraq and to the Gulf war veterans and and the same situation is
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.840]  developing here that the smoke that you see coming off
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.920]  um in the pictures from those reactors from the Fukushima reactors and from the
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.640]  fuel ponds where they're overheating and boiling
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.880]  is smoke consisting of radioactive particles these particles are invisible
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:49.440]  once they get into the air and they float about the place
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.880]  they're not detected at all by Geiger counters because they are alpha
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.200]  emitters in the case of tritium it's a it's a liquid gas just like water
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.720]  and it's a beta emitters not detected either by Geiger counters so
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.560]  if there's a little bit a little increase in in the millisever sort of being
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.560]  measured in some place you may be sure that associated with that is a very
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.000]  large number of very small particles that you will be inhaling and that will
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.520]  certainly cause a significant increase in ill health
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.560]  cancer congenital malformations uh a whole range of illnesses the same ones
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.760]  that we saw after Chernobyl now what will happen is there'll be a cover-up
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.640]  after Fukushima people will be dying all over the place
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.080]  they're bicarbonate from cancer and other diseases and they'll say oh well
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.160]  you know it's a result of exposure to the tsunami or the figures are wrong or
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.680]  whatever the nuclear industry will will will make some
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.200]  way in which they can continue with their operation which is basically
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.480]  polishing off the human race in in small you know by this doctor
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:50.320]  you know i made the statement yesterday what is giant profits
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:55.920]  worth if your children die of cancer what is the whole world worth if you
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.960]  lose your soul i agree with you i mean i and it's worth
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:04.640]  from that because i've been studying in this regard
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.800]  the the health effects in iraq uh and in the middle east and those
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.360]  depleted uranium particles which float around the world
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.800]  are most concentrated in that area and a study was carried out
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.880]  a year or two ago in jerusalem which showed that the sperm count in the
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.960]  Israeli men uh was falling rapidly and and these people
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.480]  predicted these um in this scientific paper they predicted
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.240]  that if this continued at the same rate by the year 2020
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.920]  there would be no more Israeli people that it would it would actually finish
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:37.840]  off the Israeli people because they would be inferred completely infertile
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.760]  and this is a consequence i believe of the releases of these
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.760]  radionuclides in this particular case you know uranium in the middle east but
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.440]  but but now we have more radionuclides and since 1955 when they started atomic
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.560]  testing writes through to Chernobyl and and the releases from
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.600]  nuclear power stations which we know cause childhood leukemia
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.960]  these are if you like just the outward signs of something that's happening to
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.080]  the genetic makeup of the human race and the
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.120]  fertility will go down and down and down there'll be more and more cancers and
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.520]  eventually we will have polished ourselves off
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:14.880]  and all because the nuclear industry wants to make money and people invest
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.120]  in uranium shares and and they're determined to ensure the uranium shares
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.400]  don't don't disappear which of course they will do if the nuclear industry is
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.320]  not gone ahead as a result of this disaster at Fukushima
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.680]  the uranium shares will just turn into dust in people's hands
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.840]  uh doctor let me back up what you're saying here i've seen numbers in western
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:37.360]  europe uh and and and the maps you know as you
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.560]  pointed out major studies not just in israel but in western europe
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.280]  france the united states canada who have a lot of
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.480]  nuclear reactors japan we see an 85 to 87 percent
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:52.320]  uh sperm fertility drop the sperm don't have tails
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.960]  they don't have proper uh heads their genetics
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:01.680]  are very seriously damaged and i've just cbs news reported a few months ago
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.760]  all over tennessee texas wherever they've had these big
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.320]  nuclear weapons production facilities or the rod production facilities
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.000]  uh clearly it's leaking into the water and that's another reason not just the
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.320]  500 plus above air test done 300 of which were
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.200]  done by the u.s uh themselves that that this is a clear connection that they
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.520]  know that radioactive isotopes directly attack
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:31.440]  uh the sperm production centers uh in the mail the testicles
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:36.000]  and and and here's another example pickering nuclear plant leaking radioactive
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.640]  water afp and they say they released radioactive
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.400]  water into the lake uh in canada in ontario
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.920]  but they say this is not a problem i mean it's just ongoing these people
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:55.120]  are killing us well you have to ask yourself why i mean are they just stupid
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.640]  or is it perhaps i mean and there are people who believe that there's some
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.000]  it this is some method of trying to control the number of people on earth
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.360]  my own feeling is it's not that i think they are just stupid i i've met these
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:08.160]  people at the very highest level on government committees
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.280]  they have a very curious way of seeing the world they try to see the world
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:15.120]  through mathematics that's the problem and but if you see the world through
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.120]  mathematics you have to exclude all the second order observations you know
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.360]  you in mathematics only that you can only deal with
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.720]  the rather simple problems they're doing one-dimensional mathematics
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.440]  you're right you're right they don't do joined up thinking
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:31.760]  um and in fact that i was that i was i met a neurophysiologist very famous
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.840]  neurophysiologist a few months ago who said that the problem with the modern
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.960]  world is that it is driven by scientists who only
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:43.040]  use a left brain and the left brain thinking that thinkers are very good
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.200]  at looking at very small disconnected problems but they don't seem to be able
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.640]  to act all that all of these things together to get to any reasonable
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.680]  conclusion physics is like that you know what it does
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.280]  is it tries to isolate problems in the laboratory and take away all the second
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.160]  order effects and look at them under a microscope and then come to some
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.600]  conclusions but the problem is that you can't then put all those facts back
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.840]  together and get back to reality well reality as you know doctor
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.520]  yeah and and and the globalists even admit this is one of the problems with
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.720]  their system they're looking at at one simple
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.960]  system and the effect that that's going to have and not all the butterfly effects
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.280]  and endless ripple effects as it connects into everything else but
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.920]  you give the example of the sperm count in israel alone
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.760]  i mean this is a fact and it's just like israel using du
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.520]  in lebanon four years ago even though the wind is mainly blowing
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:39.120]  blowing south right back on them i mean this is like a gun
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.880]  where you pull the trigger and it kills your enemy but fires a delayed bullet
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.240]  right back at you absolutely and we saw that in particular with
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:50.160]  with the gulf war where the united states went in there and shot all that
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.680]  uranium all over the place and then there was a huge increase in ill health
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.520]  in in their and and also for infertility and congenital
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.760]  malformation in the children in their own population and the soldiers who
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.720]  came back it's quite extraordinary that they can continue to
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:09.040]  to bury their heads in the sand and and not not recognize that they're
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:12.880]  destroying the human race with all this nuclear radiation and the radio
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.600]  nuclides that they're dissipating into the biosphere
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.960]  i mean it is truly appalling and we have
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:26.000]  incidentally managed to interview the main man in the international
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.760]  commission on radiological protection the doctor jack valentin
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.200]  and this video is on vimeo if anyone wants to look at it if they put in
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.800]  valentin buzzbee on google they'll find it on and then vimeo they'll find the
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.160]  video uh this is hold on dr buzzbee an open meeting
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.400]  a year or so back and this man who's the scientific secretary of the
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.840]  international commission on radiological protection but who had just resigned at
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:52.960]  that point met with me and he admitted that
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.000]  well i'll tell you what dr buzzbee we got to go to break stay right there come
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.360]  back and recap this key information you're giving us then let's look at

[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.480]  world government i believe first of all that we now
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.600]  need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial

[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.720]  to the bbc he's also a professor and dr dug rocky from radiation illnesses to
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.160]  too ill to come on he is tough as nails 30 plus surgeries
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.360]  many of his team have died just cleaning up du which is uh
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:30.400]  again gets inside the body but dr long segment coming up this one short
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:34.080]  um you got cut off by the break trying to give out
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.960]  some videos that people can watch and a top
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.360]  uh government regulator uh admitting something to you please continue
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.520]  yes no you need to know that the the risk model that the u.s is using in every
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.800]  other country is using to to estimate the amount of
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.080]  health damage you get from radioactive exposure
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:57.600]  is run is operated by an um an outfit called the international commission on
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.880]  radiological protection the icrp well i met with the
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:04.160]  headman in the icrp his name is jack valentine in stock
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:08.160]  home uh 2009 april and he just retired
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.760]  and i i i did a face-to-face interview with him on video which you can find on
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.680]  vimeo.com um and if you type in busby valentine
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:20.320]  that's probably the easiest place to to find it valentine is v a l e n t i n
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:25.280]  anyway on this sir we'll post it we'll post it on info wars.com sorry go ahead
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:28.560]  okay on in this debate in this talk that we had
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.720]  he admitted that the risk model that's currently being used is inaccurate
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.320]  for internal radiation by a factor of up to 100 times
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.160]  no up to 900 times 999 times two orders of magnitude
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:44.480]  and that's kind of what we're saying so if and this will explain the effects from
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.280]  uranium that you see in the Gulf war it would also
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.600]  would also predict that the exposures to the material from the Fukushima reactor
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.640]  will have a significant effect you'll get increases in cancer
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.160]  leukemia all sorts of things but they will be denied on the basis of the
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.960]  current risk model that risk model is wrong
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.480]  it's easy to show that it's wrong and this is this is probably the greatest
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.000]  public health scandal of all time because that is the operative model
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.320]  since about 1955 and it's been there just to save the nuclear industry and
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.560]  enable it to continue to make bombs and nuclear power and all the other stuff
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.240]  doctor many experts we've interviewed and many experts i see in the news are
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.760]  saying since monday that this is a cover-up that they believe meltdowns have
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.800]  already occurred that the japanese now admit that some of the cores two of
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:31.120]  them are exposed what about the 640 plus
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.760]  thousand rods they admit were stored there most of which were stored on top
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.480]  of the containment buildings and have been ejected
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.280]  into the atmosphere spectacularly when the mark one mox reactor at reactor three
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:48.480]  blew up monday yes yes absolutely i i i agree with all of those things and i
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.240]  said this quite early on on the british radio and
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.560]  and television night i knew about the mox and i mean what an incident what an
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:01.040]  a curious and stupid place to put your your spent fuel on top of the reactor
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.400]  i mean it's almost asking for trouble to put it right on top of the nuclear
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:08.240]  reactor but actually the amount of radioactive fuel
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:13.200]  outside these reactors is greater than the amount that's inside the reactors
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.120]  and if that melts down which it can do incidentally if the plutonium melts down
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.560]  we could have a nuclear explosion like they did have in mayak in 1950
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:24.800]  in 1957 the famous kishtim explosion and that explosion created
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.800]  a wasteland of 350 square miles in in in russia
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.320]  which is still a wasteland in breakdown that incident for those that aren't aware
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.280]  of it uh... in 1957 a waste tank in in the mayak
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.280]  facility exploded kishtim in russia and we didn't find out for
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:44.880]  several years that this had happened and it then it blew radioactive waste
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.160]  plutonium and so forth over an area of six of 350 square miles i believe
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:54.080]  and created a wasteland which which anybody can see in the russian film
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.680]  stalker incidentally the very famous film by andrei Tarkovsky
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.120]  the background from this for the stalker film is the wasteland of the of the
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.160]  mayak facility which is still fenced off and nobody can go in there because it's
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.560]  so radioactive unbelievable and
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.280]  continuing uh... we're about to go to break but
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.520]  what would you do if you were on the west coast most the models new york times
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:18.800]  uh... us department of energy know that you mentioned
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.360]  say that uh... the the main blim is going to hit
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:25.520]  los angeles and then turn north along the mountain range
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:29.520]  uh... and that's just the first leakage from friday
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.720]  days behind that is the more intense
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:36.720]  i've already we've already put a signal out on the low-level radiation campaign
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:41.360]  website lrc dot org we're we're we're monitoring the situation what we told
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.600]  people to do is you have to stay inside you have to drink
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.960]  uh... what bottle water you please don't drink the milk and seal the windows
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.640]  get hold of a tiger counter for any increases in radiation get inside fast
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:57.600]  okay because because any increases in gamma radiation will signal the arrival
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:00.720]  of these particles and it's the particles that you have to worry about
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:04.720]  because one particle when you inhale it can get into the lymphatic system and
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.080]  cause trouble uh... well cause cancer cause leukemia and
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.200]  the problem the problem about external and internal radiation is that the
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.240]  particles deliver an enormous dose to local tissue
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.480]  it's really simple it's not rocket science if you get a big dose from outside
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:22.320]  you get so many tracks going through each cell but if you inhale one single
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.440]  particle you can get a lot a lot more tracks just through through
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:28.800]  through the little tissue volume close to that particle
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.160]  and that is the problem that's that that's a mistake that's been made by the
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.480]  icrp and which this guy valentin now concedes to be a problem in fact there
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.720]  was a bush government committee set up just
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:42.240]  to consider this it was set up by the the british
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.160]  minister for the environment michael lee
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.760]  alright doctor stay there
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.280]  long segment coming up we'll be right back with you sir to continue along that
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:55.280]  line we're on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:00.160]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:06.400]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:09.600]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.600]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.800]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.200]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:25.440]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.080]  attention for the republic identifies the
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:31.520]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.600]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.480]  government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.760]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.560]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.080]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.120]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.760]  we're seeing the impact right here in the united states
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:15.360]  ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.760]  hit a 30 month high in february and pump prices are expected to reach five
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.720]  dollars a gallon because of shipping costs food
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.320]  is being priced out of the reach of millions of americans with an expected
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:30.160]  35 jump in the next 60 days move quickly while you

[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:04.640]  a very wealthy u.s citizen is predicting that in 2011
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.720]  we will witness the most important day in america in more than 50 years
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.480]  he says it will change everything about our lives the way you shop travel
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:15.920]  invest educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.880]  own family now this man has made some outrageous predictions
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.000]  over the years the crazy part is he's usually right
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.520]  you see he predicted the collapse of gm panty may friday mac
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.960]  and america's biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.440]  barons called his work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you

[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.960]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:42.640]  i can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video online
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.720]  today he explains everything you need to know

[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:21.280]  you want answers well so does he it's alex jones on a gcm radio network
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:27.520]  dr chris buzzley is our guest he is a chemical physicist a chemist and a
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.680]  physicist and everything he's saying
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:35.680]  dovetails with the research we've done with countless other researchers
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.440]  physicists chemists medical doctors radiation specialists
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.200]  with the depleted uranium they use thousands and thousands of tons of it
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:47.440]  in each war now they use it at local shooting ranges and proving grounds
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:51.440]  all over the world they use it in hawaii they use it in texas
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:56.160]  hundreds and hundreds of sites total just 20 years ago they wouldn't dare
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:00.000]  they had the pentagon zone manuals that it was a cold war emergency weapon at
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.520]  the russians poured into europe once nuclear war was already on
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:07.600]  it has a four plus billion-year half-life now they say well it doesn't put off a
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.880]  lot of radiation though you shouldn't sit on the ammo can
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.160]  but that's not the issue it's that when you breathe it in and it aerosolizes
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.520]  when it hits targets and when you fire it it's on fire when it goes out of the
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:26.080]  m16 the 308 the 50 cal the the abram's gun the artillery
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.840]  when you breathe it it goes in and gets in your lungs in your lymphatic system
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:34.880]  and causes cancer and this is admitted the british medical journal 12 to 15
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.600]  times deformities in feluja alone four time increase in our troops of
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.760]  congenital birth defects cancers caused directly by it they know
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.560]  but they use it which shows a brazen psychopathic
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:52.080]  attitude now we're talking about stuff much worse than du now
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.520]  we're talking about tritium we're talking about uranium plutonium
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.320]  we're talking about all the things that all this way spewing into the air
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:02.720]  touches now becoming radioactive in a chain reaction
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.600]  and blowing towards the west coast and doctor they've gone from denying
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:11.680]  that it would reach the illusion islands today and then
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:15.600]  the west coast tomorrow and when that first low-level radiation hits from
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.120]  just the leak on friday they're going to spend and say no big deal
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.840]  but then follow it that's what that's what they're going to say because they're
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.040]  going to say that the radiation doses that you measure on
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.760]  on using geiger counters are only only some fractionally
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:33.040]  higher levels than natural background radiation
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.720]  now and that is the basis of the lie and it is a lie that has resulted in the
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.920]  greatest public health scandal of human history
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:45.440]  which began with the weapon nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.960]  and produced the cancer epidemic which began in the 1980s
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:52.320]  and everybody has seen that cancer epidemic and that is a consequence of
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.320]  the earlier exposure to the weapons fallout then we had the Chernobyl accident
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:00.400]  which increased the levels of cancer and now and now if you look at the cancer
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.880]  data which i've been studying now for 20 years
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:07.600]  it's just been continuing to increase in all of the countries that keep data
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.520]  and the reason for that is exposure to all of these materials that we've been
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:14.720]  talking about mainly these particles but other internal
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.200]  radionuclides like tritium and like strontium 90
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.840]  materials which bind to dna this is the point the uranium binds to dna
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.280]  plutonium binds to dna strontium 90 binds to dna so
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.840]  they actually deliver their radioactivity they deliver the electrons
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.000]  directly into the dna whereas external radiation
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.920]  it delivers it into the body and most of the energy is lost in the water
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.440]  so you don't get you don't get such a high dose of the dna and this is
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.280]  this is why these internal radionuclides are very very much
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:51.440]  more dangerous and why they have resulted in this cancer epidemic and as i said
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.880]  earlier in the in the reduction in sperm count and therefore the
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.160]  decrease in fertility so that all of the young people now who want to have
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:01.920]  children are running or offing having IVF treatment and all sorts of peculiar
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.160]  treatments or and now even i even heard about a situation where
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.480]  they can produce a child with three parents so you have one cell and you
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:14.000]  want dna from the father and dna from the mother and and a cell from somebody
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.360]  else again so they destroy just like the gmo companies
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.400]  destroy the capacity of indigenous populations
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:24.560]  to grow their own natural food and then sell them terminator seeds that they
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.480]  have to buy each year now is the human genetic systems destroyed
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:31.840]  then we have to go get artificial treatments to continue to reproduce
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.760]  giving the scientific dictatorship control over reproduction
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.320]  and over the future of the species i wanted to expand on something
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.800]  here with you doctor along the lines of the radiation
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:48.480]  situation what do the people in the establishment
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:51.840]  think i mean you say that that some think it's population reduction which
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.360]  a lot of top globalists have stated they want but on the other hand they're
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.680]  being affected by it as well is it just a i mean here's an example
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:06.080]  during the early 1960s dozens of high-powered hydrogen bombs were
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:10.000]  detonated in the upper atmosphere and in the van ellen radiation belt
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.640]  quote just to see what it would do just to show how crazy they were and they
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:17.920]  thought that some of this might ignite the atmosphere
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:22.160]  and burn the entire earth up but they still did it i mean it seems like these
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:25.600]  are psychopaths i i agree with you you know and in
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.280]  fact the science for me the science is not is not as interesting
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.880]  as asking the question why do people believe what they believe in mine
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.520]  particular do these people believe what they believe
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:39.440]  that is a very interesting question and i think it has to do with the filtration
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:43.840]  of particular types of personality into the realm of science and physics
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:47.280]  i think a lot of these people who hire people who i've met
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.200]  are they come out to touch reality they kind of started
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:54.720]  as people who were shy and so they wanted to try and control the world
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.000]  themselves and feel less fearful by dealing at home with mathematics with
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.880]  things that they could understand and trying to model the world in these
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.760]  curious mathematical arcane
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.920]  distracted ways and and they really are very out of touch with the reality i mean
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.680]  i saw one guy for instance a chap i know quite well who used to be head of
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:16.800]  research for british nuclear fields in cellar field he was trotted out on the
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.360]  bbc to talk about how safe it was if this material came over and of course he
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.160]  did what he was supposed to do and said how safe it was
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.280]  but this guy i know i got to know reason that we will because he was on this
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:30.560]  this government committee where we were discussing the effects of internal
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.120]  radiation and i have to say that i think the chap is
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.200]  quite mad he is completely detached from reality he was a
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:40.640]  particle physicist to begin with and has turned himself into some kind of
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.160]  nuclear expert which of course the people who run the nuclear industry
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:47.280]  like because they make money out of scientists like that so there is a
[01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:51.120]  particular type of scientist who tells the government or the
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.080]  nuclear industry or whoever it is that wants to make money more or less what
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.760]  they want to hear and so the people the people who are
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.880]  running the show tend to believe this lot and and and i think that has to be
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.920]  how it works in some kind of personality filtration
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:09.120]  sure doctor different kinds of people different kinds of personalities and they
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.680]  do get filtered into different jobs don't they
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:15.120]  sure that's that that's the social engineer mastercraft
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:18.720]  is picking different types that they study and track and then putting them
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.760]  into certain specific areas so they don't see the larger
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.640]  larger systems i think that's certainly true it's what i've seen
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:30.320]  uh in in my travels amongst these amongst the realms of the exalted
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:34.560]  yes and yeah so you've seen i mean that that that is my message of the planet
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.160]  i get it if you get it you know since this does go out into america the most
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.160]  important message that i have to give you all is that all of this is the same
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.160]  thing that the belt down at Fukushima and the responses to it are the same
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.080]  as the meltdown at the explosion in Chernobyl and the responses to that
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.200]  and the and the and the various responses of the nuclear industry to the
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.960]  arguments uh based on science on on epidemiology on many many studies
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.720]  but there have been huge increases in cancer and other ill health
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.720]  in fact destruction of the human genome following exposure to radiation
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:11.600]  um and and all of this all of this stuff is has become the greatest public
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:15.200]  health scandal of all time and it has to do with the difference in the way in
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:18.320]  which radio and euclides are modeled the difference between between
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:21.600]  external radiation from an x-ray machine or from natural background
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.400]  radiation and internal radiation from a whole new range of substances that
[01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:31.280]  never existed until 1945 entirely novel in terms of
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.880]  evolution and these substances are slowly killing everybody
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.800]  yes sir doctor i want to shift gears into some other areas but adding just a
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.640]  caveat to what you've said i've interviewed countless medical
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:46.720]  doctors here many of them who went to medical school in the 40s 50s and 60s
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:51.520]  to find a child with cancer then was like finding a four-leaf clover it was so
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:55.040]  rare that that doctors would travel from thousands
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:58.560]  of miles to see them now there are children all over my neighborhood with
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:01.200]  cancer dying they're all over the schools you go
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.080]  out to the mall you see them with their hair falling out from
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:08.160]  chemotherapy you read them in the obituaries every day
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:11.120]  we know cancers on average are up over 2000 percent
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:17.440]  even more statistically in children and then you see the tsa with unmetered
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:20.960]  radiation systems scientists come out and say it's 20 to 50 times the
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.480]  radiation uh they lie about it then then we
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:27.600]  learned it's at least 10 times this week that they were covering it up and
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:32.240]  that it's frying the tsa workers who are standing around all day but they
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:37.200]  think they can wave a magic wand of false irrational exuberance
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.040]  and say we're fine you know this is safe
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:47.360]  and it just shows almost a mass false confidence
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.760]  yes i agree with you i agree with you it's very hard to understand how it goes on
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:54.960]  it really is uh it's a sort of group thing
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.720]  involved in which these people just talk to each other and and assume that
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:01.840]  everybody else is stupid my my my belief is in fact
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:05.680]  that the ordinary people are actually quite clever
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.960]  and they can usually figure out what's going on and i see that that's happening
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.720]  in japan incidentally everybody's everybody's fleeing if they can't
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:17.600]  you know nobody's believing the government and and the the
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:23.040]  credibility of the authorities has been decreasing well that was my next
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:26.320]  question doctor that was my next question now we've got reports the
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:29.520]  japanese are getting angry we have no homes the radiation
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:33.840]  is higher than what you said how is well number one
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.360]  we're now six days into this there the the media is saying
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.960]  the point of no return may have been reached they may fully melt down a lot
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.840]  of experts believe that meltdowns have already occurred
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.080]  they're covering up the real levels in those two states in and around fukushima
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.880]  and the six stricken reactors four that have blown up
[01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:55.360]  or on fire uh a how do you statistically
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.000]  see this generally unfolding how long could the disaster go on weeks
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.880]  months how much this is a very good question there's three possibilities
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:10.480]  and two of them are very bad um and the one that i think is likely to happen
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:15.120]  is one of those now there's about 1500 1700 times of mixed
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:18.640]  ox mixed uranium and plutonium fuel there my feeling is that the radiation
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.160]  levels will get so high that those guys will have to they will either die or
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:25.760]  they will have to get out and probably you know they're not they're not really
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.800]  doing an awful lot of good from what i can see this is desperate nonsense you
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.240]  know they may as well try and piss on those things as in terms of
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.120]  trying to do anything because there's huge amounts of radio of plutonium and
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.320]  uranium there getting hotter and hotter and hotter so two things can
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:44.480]  happen the first thing is that they can do do the sort of china syndrome melt
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:47.440]  down and that's probably the best thing that can happen so they will just
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.960]  melt down and fall through the ground and a lot of bad smoke will come out
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:56.320]  but it will mainly be will be confined to the north island of japan so a lot of
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:00.480]  stuff will come across the united states but it won't be like huge amounts but
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:03.840]  i tell you what the main problem is that if the plutonium
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.360]  which is much more critical critically able to
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.720]  to produce neutrons and explode in what's called
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:14.960]  a prompt fission if that gets together in the bottom of a tank and explodes like
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:18.480]  in the kishtim accident then it will be absolute nightmare for the globe never
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.600]  mind about japan that stuff will go up into the atmosphere and it'll get into
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.160]  the sea and it'll float everywhere and it's a really serious serious accident
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:29.440]  but i mean much worse than Chernobyl the amount of uranium that came out of
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:33.600]  Chernobyl in the explosion was 50 tons we've got 1700 tons
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.320]  untold in the spent fuel and about 600 tons in the reactors themselves
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:42.320]  and if they can't keep that stuff in and it does go up in a nuclear explosion
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.600]  it will be spread all over the planet and that will be
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.720]  unimaginable the consequences of that unimaginable
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.920]  so that's so those are the two things first of all let's hope that it melts
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.440]  through the bottom of everything and goes into the ground and disappears down
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:58.640]  with at least that will produce an area that they can contain so they can throw
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:02.000]  friends around it and they can call the north island of japan
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.640]  mankind is folly and the sea will become contaminated and the fish will be
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.120]  contaminated and people can't eat them and all the rest of it
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.560]  the second one is the explosion which we we just keep our fingers crossed and
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.480]  hope to god doesn't happen and the third one is they could just
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.840]  keep pouring water on it forever and radion that radion
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.280]  euclides will slowly leak out all over the place but i i don't think that's
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:26.480]  going to be possible myself but i mean i may be wrong the trouble is you know
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.560]  we're in science fiction territory here nobody has ever actually been able to
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.760]  do it nobody's ever done this before this hasn't happened before anywhere
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:37.280]  so we don't know what's going to happen that the calculations say that there
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.040]  will be a china syndrome you know like that famous film but we don't have any
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:46.480]  hollywood actors to come and protect us as they did in the film
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:50.880]  and uh in fact the u.s as ronald reagan is i think steaming away as fast as it
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.920]  can go since it started to pick up radio activity on it
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:01.760]  well doctor um continuing along this line
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:05.920]  um you know fully understanding where this is going
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:10.160]  i don't think that this is something the nuclear industry is going to be able
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.840]  to spend this is a bridge too far and the fact that they've been trying to
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.240]  cover it up i think is going to be the death knell to their
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:19.280]  credibility because we didn't have the internet during chair noble or during
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:23.120]  three mile island a comment on that yeah and we don't we didn't have gaga
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:27.520]  counters either after chenobyl so many gaga counters were being sold on ebay
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.200]  that an awful lot of them are out there now i mean when chenobyl was happening
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.480]  i was i was here in wales and we got the radiation from chenobyl came here i
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:38.480]  couldn't afford a gaga counter nobody else had one but now everybody's got one
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.360]  and i've got a laboratory here with several and the internet is there and
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:45.920]  they're giving minute by minute reading us from all sorts of sites all over
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:48.720]  the united states and japan and everywhere else
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:52.000]  so yeah they can't spend they can't spend it on that level but i tell you how
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.600]  they will spin it what they'll do is they'll say that the doses are very much
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:59.920]  too low just like i said before so that the number of millie seabirds
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:03.360]  involved when you go and it gets to america will be very low and then when
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:06.960]  you do get an increase in cancer five years later there'll be a big increase
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.640]  in cancer they'll say oh well it's because of all you know there's an aging
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:13.920]  population or or they'll find some reason to
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.120]  say that the cancer is nothing to do with the exposure just like they did with
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:20.880]  chenobyl where they were saying that cancer was caused by radiophobia i mean
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:25.680]  i was at a conference in Kiev in 2000 where the international atomic
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.760]  energy agency was saying that cancer was caused by drinking vodka
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:34.960]  so they will certainly have a go at spinning it you can be sure of that
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:38.480]  they will certainly have a go at it you can be assured of that i mean look i
[01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.160]  have children three of them and i am in the the realm of reality that's why i
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:46.960]  told people friday it was worse than they were saying saturday
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.280]  monday the fuel rods hiding in plain view it's in mainstream news that 600
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:54.160]  thousand fuel rods are there that hundreds of thousands were stored on
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:57.680]  top of plants that blue sky high and then they're
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.000]  not releasing the radiation information the media made fun of people
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.920]  saying that radiation would come here friday saturday sunday monday tuesday
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:09.360]  wednesday now they admit it's coming here but the usual can
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:13.040]  responsive oh it's no big deal you know it's it's three or four times what you
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:16.240]  get from the sun uh no it's going into your body ladies and
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:19.920]  gentlemen and it's it's it's it's affecting your lifetime dose
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.680]  we already get cancer because of the natural amount of
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:26.960]  of radiation out there and i've seen the studies of mummies
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:32.880]  uh in china not just in egypt and cancer is unknown these are real numbers
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.760]  cancer was almost unknown 150 years ago and in the last 50 years
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:41.600]  listen i i've got friends that work in the office whose girlfriends
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:46.640]  have died of cancer or dying kids dying it it's school i mean it's it's an
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:50.720]  epidemic and and this and and elitist children are dying
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:55.040]  and clearly a big part of this is the dioxins and the mercury and the
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.920]  vaccines but the big driver from the studies i've seen
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:02.400]  is the radiation the runoff from the plants the runoff from the
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:05.600]  from the weapons plants and they're killing us
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:09.040]  and look at america the biggest you know nukesite in the world after russia
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:12.000]  highest cancer rates then they lie and say well
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.920]  are you know we're living longer actually the u.s uh population
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:19.040]  uh numbers have gone down and they don't tell you that
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.440]  fetal birth rates baby's dying that number's gone down
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.600]  on average about 30 of children 100 years ago would die from complications but
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:31.280]  if you made it past five if you look at the numbers and average those out the
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:36.480]  average person lived past 85 now with men it's about 73
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:40.720]  women it's 76 and then they have all these advanced technologies to keep you
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.360]  alive for 20 years when you start getting sick
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.960]  sick at 55 but it's unnatural we'll talk about that
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:51.440]  that with the dr busby website greenaudit.org an amazing individual
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.560]  all of his information integrates with my own research
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:57.520]  and the countless physicists doctors we've interviewed
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:00.880]  i believe and i know this is a eugenics operation by design
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:03.920]  we'll be right back hi this is alex jones did you know that the global
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.560]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.160]  storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.360]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.640]  it's true seeds have outperform even gold and silver before in this country
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.480]  and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:23.360]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:27.040]  seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:31.280]  produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:34.640]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:37.680]  any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:42.240]  acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:49.040]  that's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:55.600]  that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:59.280]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for

[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:07.120]  advice for all those interested in practical economics and sound
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:11.120]  money it's certainly worth reading that's what congressman ron paul said
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.040]  about chachin wisdom 123 practical universal truths about
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.040]  money the new book by dr. david berry the cool part of this book certainly it'll

[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:25.600]  investments but it also can be generalized into the nation what's
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:28.640]  going on as a nation we do these same things as personally that we do as a
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:32.720]  nation dr. berry's book chachin wisdom presents many facets of your
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:36.560]  relationship with the once almighty dollar and how current national and

[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.640]  about that they're not just economic they're
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:45.360]  philosophical there's psychology involved in this book there's

[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:28.320]  young and reduces inflammation one world way protein powder may be able to
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:31.840]  raise your glutathione production by 64 or more
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:35.840]  one world way is more effective than any other way protein powder on the market
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:39.120]  because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows

[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.040]  explosion
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:16.880]  what do you think is going to happen if there are huge and we don't know it
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:19.120]  could have already happened with the cover-up that's going on
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:22.800]  what's going to happen to Tokyo 150 miles away from Fukushima
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:28.480]  now most of it's going out to sea but as the wind changes and blows over that
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:33.360]  disaster site it is almost incalculable what is going to happen
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:38.000]  Dr Christopher Busby is our guest for just a few more minutes
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.880]  he is a chemical physicist sir in the time we have
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:47.440]  what can we do obviously put pressure on the government we know the pentagons
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:50.480]  out there getting readings they're not telling us they just moved the chips
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:54.160]  back 200 miles there there's clearly a cover-up going on
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.000]  here what can we do to try to deal with this I mean
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.520]  I mean here's an example here in Austin they have an experimental
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:04.880]  reactor and a second reactor at the JJ Pickle Center
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:08.560]  it's been there for decades and I tell the average Austinite about it
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:11.280]  and then I'm concerned about it and they laugh at me there's almost like an
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.800]  inbred gibbering giggling pre-programmed psychological
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:21.200]  compulsion program to giggle yes that's right you're right about that
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:24.480]  I've noticed that as well they giggle that's true this this guy was telling
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:28.000]  you about he was giggling incident
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.200]  it's kind of like a denial thing you know because their mind sort of switches
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:35.360]  off and all the cogs start meshing in in such a way so they giggle
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.960]  very interesting response I agree listen here's what you can do
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:42.240]  the point is that you have to destroy the current belief
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:46.160]  in the government in their in their risk model there is an alternative risk
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:50.080]  model out there which my colleagues and I started working on in 1997
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:54.160]  and you can find all this stuff on the website of the European Committee
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:56:00.560]  on Radiation Risk which is uradcom.org and most of the stuff I do now is
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:03.840]  actually on the website of the low-level radiation campaign
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:08.480]  so that's llrc.org you'll find a lot of my stuff on green order but frankly I'm
[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:12.720]  working so hard on on all these things these days but I don't have time or
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:15.840]  money to you know keep the green-ordered
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.880]  website up to date let me throw this at you real fast
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:22.480]  they now literally hundreds of studies admitting that cell phones are causing
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.000]  brain tumors and that it's it's it's uh...
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.040]  microwave radiation that it vibrates the DNA
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.400]  in the brain tissue and and changes it
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.720]  uh... I mean that's another example well that's right but at the way in which
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:39.680]  that works is by modulating ionizing radiation
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:42.560]  we're getting together very big studies to show this
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:46.160]  um... what happens is that just like that just like you wiggle the electrons in
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:50.560]  a in a in a tv cathode ray tube the electrons that are produced from the
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:53.520]  ionizing radiation from the plutonium from all that stuff they get
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.040]  wiggled by the cell phone radiation and you always have some of those in your
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:59.840]  body from natural background radiation you know from the
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.240]  the normal natural background stuff in your body potassium 40 and so on
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:07.440]  so if you if you found on the cell phone what happens is that
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:11.040]  the microwave electromagnetic radiation that goes into your tissue
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.600]  and causes those electrons to wiggle more and they that produces more energy
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:19.600]  and increases your ionizing radiation dose we believe that is the
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.960]  uh... origin of these increases which are very real incident well they've now
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:26.080]  admitted that brain activity increases when you're on a cell phone
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:30.160]  yes well that's because it gets heated up but that's just because what happens
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.640]  is that the as you wiggle the electrons
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:36.640]  you heat up the material just like you heat up in the microwave cooker you
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.960]  heat up your food same as the same thing
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:43.840]  unbelievable that this is going on but
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.880]  i don't think that the nuclear power industry is going to really be able to
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:50.480]  survive this i hope so i sincerely hope so but i didn't
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:54.640]  think it was able to survive to novel and it did
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:59.360]  and i've seen a lot of the modern greenies and briefly now coming out saying
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:05.200]  nuke is the answer they want neighborhood nukes they say are safe
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:10.000]  no nukes are safe no nukes i mean just operating normally they produce loads
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.320]  of radioactivity which goes and we and we see childhood leukemia near all the
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.200]  nukes of plants in germany and incidentally also all the nukes of
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:21.280]  plants that i've studied several of those um you get increases in childhood
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:24.080]  leukemia and those are like a minor's canary so if the
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:27.200]  childhood leukemia is going up it means the dna is being damaged and that's in
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.520]  the parents as well so we need to find increases in breast cancer
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:36.080]  absolutely dr busby out of time thank you so much i look forward to speaking to
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:42.640]  the near future thank you for your information

[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:31.600]  we are live into the third hour today thank you so much for joining us
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:37.760]  i want to open the phones up specifically if you are in the elution
[02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.880]  islands where they're reporting that the radiation should be arriving right about
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.600]  now or if you are in japan trying to flee south
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.280]  or have any reports or if you have family or in the military or you're in the
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:51.440]  military that have given you reports about
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:54.480]  preparations on the west coast the epa says they are preparing
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:57.280]  with more radiation monitors i guess so they can get out
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:00.720]  in front of the story and tell people that increases in radiation set to hit
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:04.400]  the west coast tomorrow are no big deal i want to open the phones up
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:13.440]  1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 we're all in the same boat as our

[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:29.680]  it's used in in firing ranges all over the world
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:33.680]  the israelis are using it now blowing back on them
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:37.760]  this is insanity and it's a hundred percent admitted
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:42.000]  12 to 15 times depending on which british or us study it is increase in
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.440]  cancers in areas of feluja where they used heavy du
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:51.120]  four times increase in our own troops this is the psychopathic nature of the
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:54.560]  new world order and you heard the doctor saying that
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.680]  you know many believe they're doing this on purpose
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:01.200]  but that they'll never admit that to him and he travels in the top circles in
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:04.000]  europe he's on the top boards in the government
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.920]  boards they just laugh and google and snicker
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:12.720]  and enjoy themselves well i happen to have the white house science our own
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:16.720]  documents talking about sterilizing us i happen to know
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:20.560]  that they are mining sodium fluoride out of
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.160]  rock formations that have uranium and other isotopes
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:27.600]  radium you name it and that that's being put in our water
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.440]  and i told you that years ago and that dr conradon talking about it years ago
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.280]  and now it's mainstream news that oh we don't know there was a cover-up of
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:38.880]  radiation in the water all over texas and other states oh the government didn't
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:42.400]  want you to know of folks they aren't just putting the fluoride in
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:47.760]  they're putting uranium and other isotopes in your water
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:51.920]  and in a way this meltdown and these explosions is a wake-up call
[02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:55.520]  we're already under this attack it's already going on they're building more
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:58.720]  reactors everywhere in canada they announced yesterday they
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:02.240]  released a bunch of radiation into the lake that it's based on and then it
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.920]  cools from and said oh don't worry it's not much above normal background
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:09.600]  yeah you put a geiger counter over it oh that's only double or triple normal
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.560]  yeah but if you drink it it sits there it gets in your bones it gets in your
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:18.400]  liver it gets in your thyroid it it gets in your
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:24.160]  limbic system it gets in your lungs and you cannot deny sperm counts in every
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:28.320]  industrialized nation are plunging plunging plunging plunging plunging
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:38.400]  plunging 1-800-259-9231-800-259-9231 we will get you
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:46.640]  up and on the air we will get you up on the year to discuss these issues
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.480]  i want to hear what you have to say if you're in japan
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:53.840]  uh if you're in the illusion islands set to be hit today
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.840]  uh if if you can get through if you run a radiation detection system in a
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:02.320]  university or private corporation we were posting videos of people with
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:05.280]  radiation detectors that are part of organizations that hook into the web
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:08.560]  to track these and they're already showing increases on the west coast
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.920]  moderate you know doubling quote from safe background level i don't know if
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:15.200]  that's accurate we're trying to track it all in infowars.com
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:18.480]  and prismplanet.com we're trying to do the best job
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:22.560]  we can but your phone calls specifically on those issues
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:30.320]  coming up on the other side of this quick break 1-800-259-9231
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.360]  and obviously we'll probably have to go into overdrive again today
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:38.640]  as all of this unfolds this is such a serious time to be alive and to see
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:43.040]  the fallout from this the media cover up the pentagon on site all over the
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:47.200]  place in japan in the pacific they know what's going on
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:50.000]  they know what's being released the japanese won't release it
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:53.440]  usa today confirm what we told you yesterday today the japanese are
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:57.440]  covering up the radiation meters i mean this is we don't know what's happened
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:02.240]  we know it's bad with all those explosions and fires
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:05.680]  you've heard alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:09.360]  respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:12.640]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:16.400]  how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:19.680]  body my name is mario safaldi and i'm the
[02:05:19.680 --> 02:05:23.840]  developer of the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:27.040]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:30.880]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:35.200]  to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:39.360]  this includes the eyes ears nose lungs
[02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:43.120]  topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:46.720]  be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:53.440]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:57.440]  as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:03.200]  that's www.silverlungs.com this is alex jones with five good reasons
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:06.560]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:10.000]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.320]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:17.920]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:21.360]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:25.040]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:28.080]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:31.920]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:35.120]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:39.040]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:42.800]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:46.240]  the solar power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:51.120]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:49.840]  seems like i just woke up one day and it was gone
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:52.880]  long gone
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:55.520]  but i know in my heart it's still a little late
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:08:01.600]  again go to gusset.com forward slash america today
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:04.960]  this is communications radio network proudly presents
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:10.720]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:14.480]  well i want to commend our audience i gave the number about five minutes ago
[02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:19.360]  for only people in japan or folks that have military
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:22.960]  information on what the military is preparing to do
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:28.240]  or folks in the allusion islands uh u.s.a today new york times all reporting
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:33.040]  confirming what we said yesterday the japanese are not releasing
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:37.440]  geiger counter data we know it was double triple or quadruple before they
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:40.720]  don't want to show 10 20 30 times if it's melted down
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:44.320]  what's really happening there that's confirmed it's also confirmed that
[02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:47.760]  they're estimating uh noah the uh you know a national
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:52.560]  weather service is predicting that the first radiation that's lower from just
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:56.480]  the smaller problems last friday we'll be reaching southern california
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:01.280]  tomorrow uh via the wind streams and not just the jet stream but the trade winds
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:05.040]  below it and the surface winds hopefully most of it will go in the ocean
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:08.480]  we're going to be here tracking all this live but i i commend the listeners i
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:13.120]  said only if you have intel or you're in japan call in and we only got one caller
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:19.440]  uh so again open phones for those uh who've got radiation detectors on the
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:23.360]  west coast who are planning to track this have you gotten higher levels are you
[02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:27.280]  in japan do you have family in japan 800
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:37.360]  259 92 31 800 259 92 31 will get you up and on the air uh right now
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:41.280]  and uh ron in california hung up ron you you were fine you you had a military
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:45.120]  source in your family that you were going to uh
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:49.440]  fill us in on what they'd said i wasn't criticizing i was saying i'm glad
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:52.960]  that you'd called it's people with specific information here's somebody
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:57.440]  else i want to open the phone up for folks in australia because the winds move
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:01.360]  also southerly and for a whole day they were blowing south
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:05.040]  and the aussies are freaking out because the japanese have such a history
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:09.200]  of covering things up i want to get your take on what your media is saying there
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:14.640]  i got emails and saw comments by aussies uh folks there in australia saying your
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:18.560]  media is basically though trying to spin it like it's no big deal some of the
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:26.640]  media is being more honest about it 1800 259 92 31 and i'll widen the field
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:30.960]  for folks to call in if you're a nuclear physicist or work in plants
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.880]  or have comments about the explosions and fires that we've seen and now the
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:39.120]  japanese saying they may have to abandon hope that they may not be able to
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:43.120]  cool these things down other reports saying they haven't lost hope
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:50.640]  i want to hear from you one 800 259 92 31 800
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:57.920]  259 92 31 let's go to chris in hawaii also in the past chris you're on the air
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:04.560]  hey alex how you doing good and i just uh i was searching the local news and i saw
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:10.720]  hawaii usps checks japan mail for radiation
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:15.280]  the first paragraph says uh us postal service in hawaii has begun checking
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:20.320]  mail arriving from japan after mail in san francisco in new york
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:25.360]  showed low levels of radiation ups official said
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:28.960]  so i just want to call you guys and turn you on to this story
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:32.400]  yes sir uh bloomberg did report two hours ago
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:42.480]  that flights from tokyo into dallas uh and into chicago uh oh hair and df w
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:47.040]  both had radiation in the planes and on the people and their baggage
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:50.960]  and they just released them and i mean that's the time to confiscate their
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:54.800]  bags and say sorry this is going to a nuclear waste dump
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:57.200]  sorry we're not going to let you take it home to your family and your kids and
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:01.760]  your neighbors or in the taxi cab the planes are getting contaminated
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:04.720]  they're also reporting mbc reporters have been contaminated
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:09.040]  and the answer is don't put them in scrubbers don't put them in decontamination
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:12.480]  facilities for their own health put them in where they scrub down with soap and
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:15.520]  water and get it all off of them and then they blast that out
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:20.640]  no just send it on into america bring it on in because radiation isn't bad
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:23.840]  see if they start acting like that radiation could be dangerous then they
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:33.200]  have to admit there's a danger see yes it's very scary now we do have those
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:39.600]  reports anything else chris no i'm just uh i'm on the big island of hawaii and
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:45.120]  just watching that jet stream and it's pretty worrisome they're not telling us
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:49.200]  anything here um civil defense you know there's no
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:53.840]  local uh rad detectors here you know i got one in the mail
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:58.720]  coming but you know living a life stuff takes four five six days to get here
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:02.320]  and well you heard what the what the chemical physicist was explaining
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:05.680]  amit dr bob bowman explained uh three degrees in physics
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:10.160]  and what countless other experts have said like dr dug rocky also a physicist
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:15.040]  uh former head of the pentagon's program on it that that even a doubling is
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:18.720]  super dangerous because if you breathe it in but the media's spinning it like
[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:21.280]  it's no big deal
[02:13:21.280 --> 02:13:26.080]  um anything and you know people in hawaii man it's
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:30.480]  there's nobody's awake here it's i've been i was talking up weeks before this
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:34.720]  and then this hit and i'm glad i just want to thank you for
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:39.600]  waking me up because uh you know my food and water and i'm ready to go get
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:43.520]  plastic from my windows i don't know you know it's the jet stream looks like
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:46.080]  this weekend it's going to kind of spin around hawaii
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:51.840]  from what i see but uh those you know we we don't have the info and i just want
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:55.840]  to thank you for keeping us informed man
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:59.120]  well sir i appreciate your call and i'm not trying to gripe at you but everybody
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:03.040]  who calls in needs to kill their radio or it becomes a distraction
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:08.560]  uh again headlines here radiation found at df w o hair this is all up on info
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:12.640]  wars dot com brought over by airline passengers detectors
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:16.720]  installed at lax radiation spurs fears around food
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:23.280]  despair turning to anger in japan um that's also all up on the drudge report
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:26.800]  and also they're reporting that some of the mail coming into the west coast
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:33.760]  has tested positive for radiation uh continuing uh no home no help no hope
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:37.760]  now japan's uh despair turns to anger tempers fray
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:43.760]  as homeless wait for food and medicine uh as folks are saying they're now six days
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:48.560]  into this uh with no evidence of being given any type of help
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:51.760]  again i've specifically asked for callers
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:56.000]  on the issues that we've been covering but no one has called in
[02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.960]  with specific intel so i'll open the phones up completely
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:02.480]  with any comments questions or points you have or if you want to point out any
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.800]  other news that we've not been covering with the economy
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:10.000]  the stock market the middle east uh the police state while we've been focused
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:14.240]  on the radiation clouds ongoing boiling out of fukushima
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:20.800]  coming our way 800-259-9231 dr bob bowman hasn't joined us in a
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:23.680]  couple of days he'll be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour to
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:27.680]  give us his expert analysis on the deteriorating situation
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:33.440]  the k itv television reporting hawaii usps checks japan mail for
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.480]  radiation san francisco new york centers
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:40.720]  find low levels of course they said for two weeks that uh
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:45.040]  that uh chair noble was low level and they said for a lot longer
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:50.800]  uh than that uh that uh there was no big deal from three mile island we now
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:53.680]  know that that was a lie the the u.s postal service in
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:57.600]  hawaii has begun checking mail arriving from japan after mail in san francisco
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:01.760]  in new york showed low levels of radiation usps official said hawaii
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:05.600]  usps spokesman duke gonzalez said there has been no mail in
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:09.040]  honolulu found with radiation yet the customs and border patrol in
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:13.120]  honolulu is hoping to ensure that the mail is screened properly he said
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:18.560]  but in dalis in in chicago they just go ahead and send it on through
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:23.920]  now i've looked at the jet stream and there's different bands of it but the
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:28.480]  main jet stream going over japan loops up in one piece by
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:32.400]  alaska down another part of it goes over by california
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:35.760]  and looking at the map if they're saying it's supposed to hit california
[02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:40.320]  tomorrow alaska is a lot closer and maybe it's true what the
[02:16:40.320 --> 02:16:44.000]  television stations reported yesterday that they picked up radiation but it
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.200]  was low level don't worry but then in the article said well it isn't here yet
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.360]  but we think it'll be low level i mean all very very suspicious
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:55.440]  will continue to watch this as it unfolds michael in new york says he
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:17:00.000]  disagrees so we'll skip josh and uh birch and go to them in a
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.680]  moment michael you're on the air worldwide
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:08.240]  why there um i wanted to talk about harp a little bit
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:12.480]  i mean i understand the concern about you know what's gonna happen immediately
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:17.200]  now but nobody really knows what this harp does
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:20.720]  and um we've had our own earthquakes here in arkans
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:25.280]  well in arkansas and with all the birds dropping out of the air right before
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:31.360]  they had their earthquakes um and then the entire pacific plate
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:35.040]  has had activity around it except california
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:38.400]  and i just think that we need to be talking a little more about harp and
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:43.040]  what exactly does it do well ma'am you may not have
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:47.920]  heard our broadcast michelle sorry i called you michael i'm looking across
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:51.840]  the room here at the names uh but we have covered harp a lot over the years we
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:56.560]  sell videos and books by dr nick megach on it uh i've interviewed the the head
[02:17:56.560 --> 02:17:59.360]  the director of harp we know that it is involved in
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:02.960]  weather modification and reportedly manipulating the magnetic field of the
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:07.760]  earth but we know last 11th march 11th on friday
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:10.880]  that hours before the mega tsunami and earthquake
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:14.800]  a huge solar flare one of the biggest ever recorded directly hit the earth
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:18.400]  that is the magnetic energy from it hit uh the
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:22.720]  Antarctic uh and uh oh even mainstream news was
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:25.600]  predicting earthquakes from it and we have the moon
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:28.960]  and we've had a astrophysicist on whose pierce corbin
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:32.400]  saying he believes the two things together clearly the moon and when it's
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:35.600]  closer you have higher tides you know higher waves
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:40.000]  it also pulls magma bulging towards the moon with its gravity
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.560]  and so pierce corbin who's highly respected has an incredible prediction
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:47.760]  rate of over 85 percent a year out on severe weather
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.920]  believes it was the combo of the moon being close and that solar flare that
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:54.240]  caused it i mean i mean it wasn't harp that
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:58.160]  caused palm pay 2 000 years ago it wasn't uh harp
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:01.520]  that caused krakatoa you know 80 something years ago to go off i mean
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:04.720]  do you see what i'm saying no i understand that i know you've
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:08.720]  covered it in the past but what i meant was just you know talking about harp
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:12.480]  in relation to this disaster that's you know
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:15.200]  what i'm saying well you you must have missed me reading secretary of defense
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:19.280]  william cohen in 97 and army times admitting that there are our governments
[02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:22.640]  with earth quake weapons uh but yes i think we should talk
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:25.440]  about it more in fact that's a great guy to get on let's get
[02:19:25.440 --> 02:19:28.800]  dr nick baggach on the next few days let's get him on tomorrow or on the
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:32.960]  sunday broadcast he's a great guy uh to have on uh to talk
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:36.240]  about that thank you michelle for pointing that out we do need to cover
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:39.280]  that more you're right we will start looking into it more
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:42.960]  i just i'm mainly looking at the fallout i got children you know you get older
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:46.000]  you don't really care about yourself too much you get resigned to death
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.280]  i enjoy life but you know what it's coming so gut up and
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:52.560]  kind of like jumping off a railroad trestle 300 feet into the water you just
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:56.240]  gut up and know it's coming and we're all got to jump someday we're all
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:01.440]  gonna die my little babies ladies and gentlemen i'm i'm very upset for them
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:05.200]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:08.880]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:12.240]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:14.880]  silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:17.840]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:20.400]  happen again so our friends at solutions from
[02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:25.040]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:38.080]  food you get a lot of it gets shipped in from asia
[02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:42.240]  a lot of it gets shipped in from hawaii wherever this radiation plume goes
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:45.200]  and while we're taking calls i'm going to put that map of the first 10 days
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:49.680]  after the 1986 chernobyl disaster
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:53.040]  and even the new york times here admits they estimate a million people have

[02:26:57.440 --> 02:27:00.880]  over lou excuse me we know they're not showing the
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:03.840]  readings for hundreds of miles around it which is a
[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:08.720]  super scary indicator again uh us today admits a cover up
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:12.080]  you're saying you got back you're talking to friends tell us as much as you
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:14.800]  can where they're located what they're telling
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.640]  because if they're having instant effects that means super high radiation
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:21.680]  and we're going to start seeing deaths this is horrible news you've got the
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:24.720]  floor uh thank you very much and i'm going to try
[02:27:24.720 --> 02:27:29.040]  and speak as briefly as i can about it just from what i'm hearing from the
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:33.760]  few people i'm talking to um in the chiba japan area and the
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:37.680]  surrounding area that's east of tokyo and then
[02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:44.560]  obviously north is where everything went down uh people are experiencing these
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:49.680]  sort of um these red blotches on their skins
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:53.840]  vomiting um all these symptoms which are like
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:59.840]  flu like and it's it's widespread this isn't just like one or two people
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:02.720]  from what i'm understanding from my friends out there
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:06.720]  and i can't you know i'm not there and there is a language barrier but i do
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:11.040]  know them that they are um receiving that kind of uh
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:15.920]  you know a massive fact already they're already receiving this and then
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.640]  after that i'd like to go into the fact that there was a secret shipment of a
[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:26.720]  nuclear bomb material from europe to japan in 1999 greenpeace had released
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:30.000]  this information now that was from mainly france
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.920]  and it was enough they reported to run japan for several hundred years
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:38.400]  or to build over 10 000 bombs or warheads i remember and in a bunch of
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:41.360]  countries wouldn't let it sell through their waters in the triple hole
[02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:45.920]  tankers yes it's this mox mixture which is
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:50.080]  actually weapon grain a weapon grade uh plutonium
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:53.440]  and that is the entire thing and the big you know uh
[02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:57.440]  thing that blows the cover off this you can look this up i can send the uh
[02:28:57.440 --> 02:29:01.360]  whole thing greenpeace did the pdf now i remember that send it send it to show
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:05.440]  tips and info wars dot com but i i was on the air in 99 i remember
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:10.000]  the big hubbub over the ship from france to japan
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:15.520]  yeah and uh that to me was just enough to really blow the top up this entire
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:18.720]  thing and then you know thank you and god bless you for what you're doing for
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:23.200]  the american people because it's all indoctrination and people have to get
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.520]  off the mainstream they have to hold on i'm just doing my job don't thank me

[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:24.880]  remain named anonymous because their government is
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:29.040]  they're indifferent you know they they work and they're very dedicated to their
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:32.080]  government um so i don't know if they would be
[02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:36.320]  willing to come forward about this but there there is a very high amount of
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:39.440]  integrity in what i'm saying because the people that the
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:43.120]  information is coming from are highly dedicated
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:48.640]  martial art students okay um my face is red i'm feeling you know like i've

[02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:05.040]  you know these type of things are what i'm hearing from
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:09.600]  friends of friends of friends of entire groups of people
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:13.520]  and they're concerned that maybe it's the stress maybe it's the barometric
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:18.480]  pressure maybe it's something else and i'm trying to come up with more
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:22.000]  hopeful thought than oh you know your radiation poison
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:27.520]  and be positive with them uh not that i would would want to lie to them and i
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:30.640]  want them to know the truth and whatever precautionary actions that they
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:33.600]  could take however you know these are the
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:37.280]  symptoms that i'm being reported to from a small you know this is a
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:41.280]  microcosm group of people i can't claim that you know this
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:44.480]  is happening everywhere but from the people that i am talking to
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:49.360]  they are absolutely receiving uh you know splotches all over their bodies
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:52.800]  numbness vomiting redness of the face
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:57.360]  earaches headaches uh flu like symptoms
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:02.160]  you know i okay sir go ahead okay please continue reporting to bowman sorry go
[02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:04.880]  ahead i thought you were done go ahead no no that's a that's
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:09.200]  that's pretty much it it's a very small area it's a you know this isn't the
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:12.320]  hundreds of people this is several dozen people
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:16.160]  you know and i think it's big news because it does show
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:19.520]  you know that there are people out there with these type of symptoms
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:22.960]  and i didn't want to say that and so i went and looked up at my myself
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:27.120]  what the specifics are of radiation poison or
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:31.520]  how fast you can be affected by that because you know maybe they're just
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:34.880]  having uh delusions or they're upset or they're you
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:38.480]  know you see this place and it's the devastation around you
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:43.200]  you could have an anxiety attack which makes you think that as well
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:46.240]  so they're you know i'm trying to give them hope but at the same time
[02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:50.080]  there are tons and tons of people you know
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:54.000]  dozens of people from friends that i know that are complaining of
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:58.240]  very similar symptoms redness numbness flu like
[02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:02.960]  vomiting all this stuff that's going on is that a possibility or are they you
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:07.280]  know uh just kind of freaking out is my whole
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:10.400]  question to them really you know i don't know but this is what they're
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:13.920]  calling me okay let me ask this how far are they
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:18.000]  from the reactor okay we're looking at chiba
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.080]  japan is south so uh an actual mile that i was
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:30.560]  google earth that um just to look i mean bukasima is north we're looking at a
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:36.560]  scale of uh 200 miles would be my estimate uh which is it's east
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:41.440]  chiba is east exactly east of japan or what yeah it's east of
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:49.680]  tokyo i'm sorry okay so it's east of tokyo uh sort of on the coast
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:54.640]  uh sort of on the coast but inside it's like a little Florida type of
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:41:00.160]  peninsula okay well my answer to you is i'm not
[02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:05.360]  surprised and i'm not a medical doctor but uh
[02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:09.760]  i'm afraid that sounds exactly like radiation sickness
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:14.880]  and it's not surprising considering the level of radiation that
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:22.560]  has come out of uh that plant and uh the distance that they are
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:26.560]  now you know if i was getting this report
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:33.280]  from somebody in illinois i would say it's psychosomatic your fears are getting
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:37.280]  the best of you it can't be radiation sickness
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:44.560]  but coming from there i'd say uh it almost
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:49.360]  certainly is i'm afraid yes and then of course i went in the
[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:52.560]  conversation with alex about this green piece
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:56.640]  speaking about uh this weapon grade plutonium that
[02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:00.800]  these particular reactors have and there's no question about it
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:04.720]  that this is you know uh the significant the difference in this
[02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:08.160]  internoble it's you know it's turnables on steroids
[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:12.640]  um so this doesn't surprise me and i'm very
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:16.240]  concerned because of the the kindness these are the most wonderful most
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:19.680]  respectful people i mean you don't even know respect
[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:23.440]  until you visit the country and see how they treat each other and it's
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:28.560]  it's sick and i've been there yeah and then to think that it's going to come
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:31.360]  to america and just like alex said with the children and
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:35.600]  you know does it blow up to chicago too i mean what are they i mean the mass
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:39.920]  effect of this you know this is big and i'm just you know if they're feeling
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:44.400]  that already uh there there is absolutely some type of
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:48.400]  evidence and you know this is several dozen people it's not the world
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:51.280]  though a microcosm we're still looking at you know
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:55.600]  evidence here that hey you know there is something happening out there and it's
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:59.520]  a lot more than we uh think and you know i thank them for the
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:01.920]  information but they're in my hopes and prayers
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:06.000]  every minute that i could pray you know for them because this is it's serious
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:09.840]  you know i wouldn't have made this call if i didn't think this was serious
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:16.480]  yeah well uh i can assure you that the similar
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:20.800]  thing is not going to happen in chicago
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:28.560]  radiation dissipates with the cube of the distance
[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:36.080]  and so there is an enormous difference between 200 miles
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:46.480]  and 6 000 miles uh the difference is like 270 000
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:51.280]  so but have we and i apologize for interrupting you sir but have we
[02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:55.440]  do we have this kind of information on this type of
[02:43:55.440 --> 02:43:59.040]  plutonium or this specifically have we ever
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:03.120]  i mean do we know did the american people even know that the repercussions
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:07.360]  of this do we have any data to go by to say that that's
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:14.720]  absolute you know with the potency of this particular type of uranium
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:23.120]  well the the fears come when uh some of that particularly in the mox
[02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:30.960]  reactor where you have a mixture of uranium oxide and plutonium oxide
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:36.720]  the plutonium if it gets caught up in the jet stream and
[02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:40.400]  carried all the way across the ocean to the united states and
[02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:47.280]  and particles fall out it's possible to breathe one of those particles in
[02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:51.680]  and in that case there is a good chance that
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:56.000]  sometime in the next 50 years you're going to come down with cancer
[02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:02.640]  uh but there is essentially no chance from what i know
[02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:07.120]  of anyone in the united states coming down with radiation sickness
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:12.320]  splotches nausea vomiting headaches that kind of thing
[02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:18.560]  there just isn't enough radiation uh by the time it gets to the united states
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:24.000]  to do that well dr bowman let me i let me just interject here for a moment
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:29.200]  specifically and lou i appreciate your phone call god bless you
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:32.400]  undoubtedly if they're not giving us radiation levels and we've seen
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:35.600]  four of the plants explode several of them sky high
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:38.960]  there's 600 000 spent fuel rods we now know many of them were contained
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:42.880]  on top of the facilities that blew up that there's a huge cover up the pentagon
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:46.640]  has readings they know what's going on they're not saying anything
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:51.840]  uh a doctor a lot of experts are in the news saying this may have already gone
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:54.480]  churnobyl they admit that two of the containment facilities
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:57.840]  have been breached they're talking about radiation levels so high they may pull
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:01.120]  out all of the relief effort with the fukushima 50 who
[02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:03.920]  say they're willing to die and that they may die
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:07.600]  i mean if this is indeed going on this looks like it could be bigger than
[02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:11.280]  churnobyl correct oh absolutely and i've been
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:15.360]  saying that for a number of days that it could be bigger than churnobyl
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:21.200]  uh and uh for the people of japan it is absolutely catastrophic
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:25.120]  and the the winds the low level winds
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:29.520]  can be fickle and they can turn where they're
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:32.560]  generally blowing from west to east they can
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:35.840]  turn and blow from the north to the south toward tokyo
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:39.920]  and they've done that uh on occasion already
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:47.200]  for brief periods uh and so the the people in tokyo are at risk
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:56.480]  uh of radiation sickness and death from this um so i i don't want to minimize
[02:46:56.480 --> 02:47:05.680]  this because to the people of japan uh it is probably worse than churnobyl
[02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:12.640]  already and the area around the plant
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:23.360]  uh may uh never be habitable again uh but i do say that uh the people of the
[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:28.080]  united states should not panic and go out and start taking iodine pills
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:32.640]  because uh it it's a waste and it's
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:37.360]  damaging to your thyroid uh the use for those pills is when
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:43.760]  you know that you have been exposed and that's the time to
[02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:51.120]  take those pills when you're in danger of radiation sickness uh the iodine pills
[02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:56.640]  cannot prevent you from inhaling a radioactive particle
[02:47:56.640 --> 02:48:00.080]  that over a period of years can give you cancer
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:03.360]  iodine pills can't help with that all iodine
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:11.520]  can do is keep the radioactive stuff from getting into your thyroid
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:18.160]  and causing immediate uh radiation sickness and death the iodine can be
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:22.800]  helpful for that so you have to understand uh
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:29.040]  when it's called for and when it isn't and uh not get climbed up now uh the
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:34.240]  people in the illusion islands in alaska are more vulnerable
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:40.240]  than we are in the continental united states
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:48.640]  um hawaii unless the jet stream dips unusually
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:58.000]  uh may escape most of it so uh you really don't know but
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:02.640]  uh yes it's probably worse than chernobyl
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:08.720]  uh but in chernobyl caused enormous uh
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:15.280]  consequences in uh eastern germany and in finland
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:22.080]  and in areas uh that initially didn't expect to be hit because
[02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:26.320]  they were west of chernobyl not east of chernobyl
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:30.640]  but they did get affected uh the the fallout
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.280]  from these freak lower level winds and any little
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:42.480]  higher low can can do that uh the fallout got into the
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:49.200]  grass in finland and affected you know reindeer and all that
[02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:55.520]  it got into uh the the mushrooms and so forth and
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:50:03.040]  the uh wild uh hogs in germany
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:08.960]  ate them and their meat became radioactive uh one thing we have to be
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:13.040]  concerned about is the food chain in the ocean
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:17.360]  and how the radioactive particles that fall out into the ocean and i think
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:23.520]  most of it will uh can possibly get into the food
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:30.240]  chain and up to the fish that we eat now that may not happen but uh
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:34.560]  i'm not familiar with the mechanisms of the food chain and how that
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:39.520]  radioactivity can get to them but there is a possibility
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:42.480]  dr bob bowman stay there can you ride shotgun with us a little bit in the

[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:36.480]  i just got out of a vtc with commander naval forces japan
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:40.400]  and i'm going to tell you the president of the united states
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:47.920]  has authorized a military assisted voluntary departure of dependence
[02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:54.560]  from japan so what does that mean that means within the next 24 hours
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:55:01.040]  there will be uh air force cargo air force passenger airplanes landing here
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:04.800]  at at suki and taking first women and
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:10.720]  children out of here most likely over to korea
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:15.280]  for one or two days and then for further transfer
[02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:18.240]  to some other place whether that's the united states
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:23.600]  or that part of it has not come through with the plan yet
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:27.920]  so the first phase of the equipment is going to be
[02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:31.760]  pacific air force uh aircraft they're going to fly into
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:35.440]  narita and fly into yakota and they're going to fly into
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.320]  at suki and we're going to take family members
[02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:46.560]  out of here uh estimate about 10 000 a day that we can get out through all three
[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:52.160]  of those uh those sites uh the president also authorized the craft
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:56.480]  one and two that's uh so that would be the next phase craft is
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:59.600]  taking civilian airliners flying them into
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:04.320]  okay spaces that's a navy address it's up on info wars dot com and prison
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:07.120]  planet dot com uh so we're now getting the women and
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:12.640]  children first dr bowman oh yeah that's a good idea
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:18.320]  i tell you watching those explosions and the hundreds of thousands of fuel
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:22.400]  rods and the smoking and the fires still ongoing what
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.080]  uh you know as a nuclear physicist as a combat pilot as a
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:29.840]  former head of the star wars program you know what would you do if you were
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:35.680]  president obama right now would you be doing ncaa basketball picks on tv
[02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:39.600]  well there there's a lot of stuff that i would be
[02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:44.320]  doing that he's not doing i think getting the women and children out of
[02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:49.120]  japan is is a good idea i would go further than that
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:54.000]  any military personnel in japan that can't assist
[02:56:54.000 --> 02:57:00.320]  in the relief effort and in uh uh taking care of survivors
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:05.120]  uh they should be pulled out too uh as a matter of fact of course that my
[02:57:05.120 --> 02:57:09.600]  position for a long time is that we ought to bring home all our troops
[02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:12.880]  from the 700 bases we have around the world
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:21.440]  and uh give the bases all back uh you know after 66 years i think it's time
[02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:25.120]  to end the occupation of germany and japan
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:32.080]  and uh uh use our military to protect our borders and our people period
[02:57:32.080 --> 02:57:38.160]  and could having this overseas empire which puts our troops at risk
[02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:42.480]  uh but don't get me wrong since they're there
[02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:47.120]  using them to actually help the people of japan i'm all for that
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:50.160]  i don't see that happening around there to
[02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:55.440]  to uh be part of the empire building but doctor we're seeing
[02:57:55.440 --> 02:57:59.920]  a pullout that certainly signifies that things have deteriorated
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:02.720]  of course they have
[02:58:03.440 --> 02:58:07.680]  he looked pretty shook up when he was on there you couldn't see the video
[02:58:07.680 --> 02:58:11.520]  but the viewers could and the listeners can go see it on info wars.com
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:15.120]  he looked like he was trying to control himself and like he was hiding
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:19.920]  something well not surprising
[02:58:19.920 --> 02:58:23.520]  dr bowman stay there calls from australia straight ahead
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:27.920]  japan are you experiencing radiation sickness are you vomiting is your skin
[02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:33.040]  getting red country code zero zero one zero zero four one
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:37.920]  one six five one six nine five seven seven seven seven
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:45.280]  will be right back four hours straight ahead
[02:58:45.280 --> 02:58:51.600]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[02:58:51.600 --> 02:58:54.800]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:58:54.800 --> 02:58:58.800]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:01.280]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:05.120]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:08.320]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:59:08.320 --> 02:59:11.840]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:15.520]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:59:15.520 --> 02:59:18.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:22.400]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:26.000]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:29.840]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:33.680]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[02:59:33.680 --> 02:59:36.560]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
[02:59:36.560 --> 02:59:38.880]  sponsors you can get more information at

[03:00:42.320 --> 03:00:45.520]  federal government weather services that may start hitting tomorrow
[03:00:45.520 --> 03:00:49.440]  on the west coast landfall around los angeles couldn't be any worse than if
[03:00:49.440 --> 03:00:53.280]  you asked me where the forecast is saying it's coming in
[03:00:53.280 --> 03:00:58.320]  jack says he's in japan jack where are you in japan

[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:09.840]  yeah i'm uh i'm i'm here about 200 kilometers southwest of the event in
[03:01:09.840 --> 03:01:13.760]  fukushima wow tell us what you're witnessing
[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:17.840]  well basically um you know the the japanese people themselves they're
[03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:22.080]  they're staying cool they're staying calm and um i really have to give it up to
[03:01:22.080 --> 03:01:25.920]  them they're really um you know considering the seriousness of this
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:30.640]  event they're really are you seeing any radiation sickness
[03:01:30.640 --> 03:01:37.920]  um no but i can tell you that um on the website that i have for my own local
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:43.840]  area here um we are showing um elevated signs of radiation
[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:49.280]  um basically something around the area of ten times the amount of the
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:52.480]  radiation that we get in a regular day here in Japan
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:58.400]  how many times sir ten times ten times and we had a doctor of physics on
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:01.520]  earlier explaining that it's the internal ingestion that makes it much
[03:02:01.520 --> 03:02:04.960]  more deadly dr bob bowman uh three degrees in physics
[03:02:04.960 --> 03:02:08.800]  is with us sir we know about the japanese sites can you
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:14.640]  tell us the address or the headline of the uh prefactory or the county uh of
[03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:18.000]  that you're in that is showing the ten times
[03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:24.960]  yes i mean i mean i mean gunma how do you spell that uh g u n m a
[03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:30.880]  say say it again g u n m a g u someone
[03:02:30.880 --> 03:02:37.200]  g u n m a so gunma correct okay if someone if someone wanted to check it
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:45.440]  out it's uh w w w dot uh p r e f dot g u
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:51.280]  in m a dot j p okay we're writing that down again
[03:02:51.280 --> 03:03:00.720]  copy again that's w w w dot p r e f dot
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:10.720]  gunma g u n m a dot j p dot j p and that's been the
[03:03:10.720 --> 03:03:13.440]  key for three days we've looked at these and haven't hardly shown them on air
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:18.080]  that they're showing you read us what it says to dr bob bowman
[03:03:18.080 --> 03:03:21.280]  well basically what i've got right now is um
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:25.200]  let's see in terms of uh milley sievert's
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:32.320]  uh is what they're telling us um uh point uh zero nine one
[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:38.160]  um and two days ago when i when i called you a couple days ago
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:41.760]  um we when when you had dr bob bowman on
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:49.600]  um we had point um uh five uh five oh one but uh but yeah we've got point zero
[03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:52.640]  nine one right now
[03:03:53.520 --> 03:03:56.080]  i'm gonna have you hold sir as we're about to go to break stay there but
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:03:59.200]  briefly in a minute and a half we've got dr bowman what does that sound like to
[03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:04.400]  you well it's fairly good news because uh ten
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:09.520]  times background radiation is uh something that tokyo has been
[03:04:09.520 --> 03:04:15.120]  experienced seeing all along with momentary spikes higher than that when
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:19.360]  the wind shifts uh so that's about as low as you can
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:24.560]  expect it to have for some time and generally that's not enough
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:30.720]  to to cause radiation sickness the people uh that we were hearing
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:34.160]  about earlier that are suffering from radiation sickness
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:39.920]  are probably uh those that are getting uh closer to a thousand times
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:44.960]  the background radiation okay we're on the site and do see those
[03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:48.560]  numbers most of it's in japanese but on air and we come back
[03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:52.320]  with the caller from australian dr bowman will have the caller who obviously
[03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:57.360]  speaks japanese and can read it uh we'll have uh jack as this is on screen
[03:04:57.360 --> 03:05:01.040]  describe it for us and read it for us and show us where to focus in stay with
[03:05:01.040 --> 03:05:05.440]  us before you throw away your used batteries you need to listen to this

[03:06:19.600 --> 03:06:24.160]  the world under their control the united nations would take over america
[03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:28.880]  the trilateral commission would control the world invisible empire chronicles
[03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:32.480]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:06:32.480 --> 03:06:36.320]  to establish an oppressive world government i believe first of all
[03:06:36.320 --> 03:06:39.520]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[03:06:39.520 --> 03:06:43.280]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the g20
[03:06:43.280 --> 03:06:46.960]  so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else
[03:06:46.960 --> 03:06:50.880]  and i got news for you you're everyone else invisible empire

[03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:03.840]  there's a man named dr walloch who is anything but your typical doctor
[03:07:03.840 --> 03:07:07.520]  both a veterinary and a naturopathic physician doc asks
[03:07:07.520 --> 03:07:11.120]  why does the united states spend more money on health care by far
[03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:14.560]  and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide
[03:07:14.560 --> 03:07:18.320]  he believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding
[03:07:18.320 --> 03:07:20.720]  of nutrition taking charge of their life
[03:07:20.720 --> 03:07:24.160]  and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition
[03:07:24.160 --> 03:07:27.440]  not by toxic prescription drugs leading to side effects
[03:07:27.440 --> 03:07:31.520]  this is clearly a deadly recipe the good news is doc walloch's message is
[03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:35.200]  resonating with an increasing number of americans who are waking up to all the
[03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:38.880]  big government big pharma manipulation of our health care system
[03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:41.920]  i like what doc walloch is saying and doing to enlighten people
[03:07:41.920 --> 03:07:45.440]  about health care and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader
[03:07:45.440 --> 03:07:48.720]  spread his message visit info wars team dot com
[03:07:48.720 --> 03:07:52.960]  and listen to dr walloch's deadly recipes lecture it makes a lot of sense
[03:07:52.960 --> 03:07:58.160]  and i want you to join our info wars team go to info wars team dot com that's
[03:07:58.160 --> 03:08:02.160]  info wars team dot com
[03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:09.200]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:15.360]  it is thursday the 17th day of march 2011 dr bob bowman
[03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:18.720]  nuclear physicist also degrees in aeronautics
[03:08:18.720 --> 03:08:23.040]  is our guest we're talking to jack in japan we'll go next australia
[03:08:23.040 --> 03:08:28.080]  in a moment that we'll put on screen the particular
[03:08:28.080 --> 03:08:34.320]  county or prefect that um he is in gunma and you can go to all these
[03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:37.120]  different places my big question is if the japanese
[03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:41.280]  government in the two uh region regional governments around
[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:44.720]  fukushima will not release data for four days and keep saying they're
[03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:47.600]  still collating data uh and of course we know most of the
[03:08:47.600 --> 03:08:51.120]  radiation is going out the sea just a little bit of it went south
[03:08:51.120 --> 03:08:55.040]  into tokyo and surrounding areas can we trust these numbers
[03:08:55.040 --> 03:09:00.800]  with japan's famous record uh dr bowman and for jack both in japan uh to give
[03:09:00.800 --> 03:09:04.720]  us real numbers uh your take on that dr bowman
[03:09:04.720 --> 03:09:10.080]  well no of course not uh the uh the only numbers that you can
[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:16.400]  trust are the numbers that uh uh you get on your own
[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:22.960]  um the government is passing on information that they get
[03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:29.120]  from tepco the utility company who has been
[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:36.080]  uh lying and obfuscating and avoiding things for years uh we know that the
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:42.320]  japanese were warned a couple of years ago at least
[03:09:42.320 --> 03:09:48.240]  uh that something like this could happen and uh you know they
[03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:55.120]  didn't do anything about it and so um we can't trust the numbers just as
[03:09:55.120 --> 03:10:00.080]  we can't trust our government to do the right thing our government
[03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:06.800]  keeps uh extending the life of uh indian point near new york city
[03:10:06.800 --> 03:10:10.480]  and diablo canyon and san anofri in california
[03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:15.440]  on fault lines and using these facilities as dumps we do have the
[03:10:15.440 --> 03:10:21.840]  uh living guide for foreigners from the region of uh the area that our caller
[03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:25.600]  gunima uh is calling us from he said uh very nearby
[03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:28.640]  briefly again jack tell us exactly where that's located
[03:10:28.640 --> 03:10:32.720]  near fukushima and are you outdoors you're not seeing people vomit
[03:10:32.720 --> 03:10:37.200]  you're not seeing people with red faces as the caller who just left japan says
[03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:40.480]  his friends nearby are experiencing you're not seeing that that's
[03:10:40.480 --> 03:10:45.360]  that's some good news you know i'm not seeing anything like that at all um
[03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:50.880]  however um in ibaraki prefecture which is just south of fukushima um
[03:10:50.880 --> 03:10:56.880]  they do have severely uh elevated uh radiation levels and my question to uh
[03:10:56.880 --> 03:10:59.440]  don't hold on let me stop you there because you're there sir and then you
[03:10:59.440 --> 03:11:03.920]  can ask your question uh what what prefect is that and
[03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:07.120]  obviously we can because they're all listed in sequential order we can just
[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:14.400]  go to www.pref and then the name of that uh region
[03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:19.920]  dot gm after that correct right exactly okay okay okay okay say the name of the
[03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:24.240]  prefect again junma no no i know i know you're in
[03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:27.520]  gunma what's the one you listed that has higher levels
[03:11:27.520 --> 03:11:33.200]  i'm sorry it's ibaraki which is the prefecture immediately south of fukushima
[03:11:33.200 --> 03:11:41.200]  how do you say that ibaraki uh i b a g r a g i
[03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:46.400]  say that again please uh that's i a
[03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:56.480]  b a g a r i i a b a g r i a r yeah exactly a r y
[03:11:56.480 --> 03:12:01.200]  a a r i a r i okay we're gonna put that in at the end of that
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:04.720]  so so because the federal government's not giving us numbers uh that's one of
[03:12:04.720 --> 03:12:06.880]  the places on our maps they're not giving us numbers
[03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:09.760]  you're saying you're getting it from the state what does it say there this is
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:13.680]  breaking news oh basically it just they've got
[03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:17.840]  really extremely elevated uh levels of radiation there and it's but they're not
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:21.120]  showing a graph because what's the graph say
[03:12:21.120 --> 03:12:24.640]  well what i found on the map that i was able to find um
[03:12:24.640 --> 03:12:31.120]  was that uh they had basically um somewhere on the uh scale of maybe 150
[03:12:31.120 --> 03:12:34.720]  times the normal you know one day's level of
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:38.000]  radiation uh that was coming in there all right well this is
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:41.520]  something usa today could do that well they followed our lead saying they're
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:45.680]  not releasing the info on those two uh counties or regions
[03:12:45.680 --> 03:12:49.920]  prefectories how do you pronounce them properly uh it's
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:54.560]  prefecture prefecture prefecture prefecture and so
[03:12:54.560 --> 03:12:59.760]  if if uh you're saying that map is currently up saying 150 times
[03:12:59.760 --> 03:13:03.600]  yes man i should have been doing this myself for two days i've been saying i
[03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:05.520]  need to go through these and they come in and i don't even sit there and do the
[03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:08.400]  basic journalism i deserve to be punched in the nose and drug to the
[03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:11.680]  screens ladies and gentlemen not thanked stay there jack
[03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:15.520]  dr bowman we're going to uh go in there don't people to flood the site and
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:17.600]  crash it now folks wait till we get there
[03:13:17.600 --> 03:13:25.920]  www.prefiabagari.gm hit it hit it hard
[03:13:25.920 --> 03:13:31.120]  dr bowman if this is confirmed 150 times levels what does that mean
[03:13:31.120 --> 03:13:34.640]  well that's sort of on the borderline where some people may start getting
[03:13:34.640 --> 03:13:38.960]  uh radiation sickness uh by the way that
[03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:43.920]  uh url you gave out i don't think was correct first after
[03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:48.240]  after the prf you have to have a dot and then i'm not sure the name of that
[03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:53.200]  prefecture is spelled right and then another dot and then jp for
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:57.280]  japan well we pulled it up with what he told us
[03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:01.840]  about the gm and it came up it's jp i'm sorry i'm out of it
[03:14:01.840 --> 03:14:04.640]  here live on air okay we're pulling it up right now
[03:14:04.640 --> 03:14:07.600]  how would you spell it dr bowman
[03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:12.240]  uh
[03:14:12.240 --> 03:14:16.000]  uh i'd be uh
[03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:22.880]  a r a g r y i do something like that i'm not sure but
[03:14:22.880 --> 03:14:26.960]  uh we need to just get a listing of the keep trying
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:35.440]  but uh it is dot jp at the end okay okay uh man i tell you uh we will um
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:39.280]  we will we will pull that prefacked up right now uh jack please can see you're
[03:14:39.280 --> 03:14:42.080]  on there you we pulled up what you said and it did
[03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:45.920]  show in your county uh that it's uh 10 times you're
[03:14:45.920 --> 03:14:51.040]  saying you're looking at it it's 150 well yeah for for uberagi
[03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:57.840]  prefecture um it's uh severely elevated at this point
[03:14:57.840 --> 03:15:02.320]  but that's not news being put out by the national japanese news correct
[03:15:02.320 --> 03:15:06.960]  um no not by the national japanese news but by the um
[03:15:06.960 --> 03:15:12.240]  the how can i say the state level news um they are definitely putting out uh
[03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:16.560]  you know the information as they see it and so there's definitely a
[03:15:16.560 --> 03:15:20.080]  move by the the state governments to go ahead and put out the news that's
[03:15:20.080 --> 03:15:23.920]  you know that's the best that they know um in order to
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:26.800]  project the people
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:32.320]  okay we're working on this right now and obviously i'll get curtain them on
[03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:36.480]  everybody else on it but um so the local news is reporting that it's 150
[03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:41.440]  times yeah and i wouldn't be surprised if that figure
[03:15:41.440 --> 03:15:47.360]  has fluctuated considerably above that over the last few days
[03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:55.760]  because it goes in ebbs and flows yeah with the wind and all the rest
[03:15:55.760 --> 03:15:59.520]  all right jack from japan anything else you'd like to add
[03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:04.560]  well just basically you know the the the french british uh australian german
[03:16:04.560 --> 03:16:09.600]  and uh u.s governments have uh declared that anybody who wants to evacuate the
[03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:13.840]  country you know that they've got free uh air flights out of the country
[03:16:13.840 --> 03:16:22.160]  and um and really um i'm to be honest i just i'm i'm not really sure how how
[03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:25.520]  certain i can be of the uh the government at this point
[03:16:25.520 --> 03:16:31.200]  um you know the everybody's saying you know if you want to get on out of here
[03:16:31.200 --> 03:16:35.600]  you can um the japanese government is telling us that uh if you're within
[03:16:35.600 --> 03:16:39.920]  uh 20 or i believe it's uh 30 kilometers of the event that just go
[03:16:39.920 --> 03:16:44.240]  ahead and uh shut your house up and uh stay in your house all right jack let me
[03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:47.280]  stop you we've got new information we did find
[03:16:47.280 --> 03:16:50.800]  that local government website but navigating it
[03:16:50.800 --> 03:16:54.080]  it is in english but we're now going into pdf files
[03:16:54.080 --> 03:16:58.480]  tell my crew and they're listening how you found the graph or the area that
[03:16:58.480 --> 03:17:02.640]  that had the numbers of the 150 times safe levels
[03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:06.560]  see what you want to do is um from the front page
[03:17:06.560 --> 03:17:12.960]  there's a there's a there's a red dot uh that uh uh with a little uh you how
[03:17:12.960 --> 03:17:20.080]  can i say uh the triangular uh uh sign that says um well gosh uh
[03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:25.760]  alex gordon put me on with your people and i'll explain to them in detail
[03:17:25.760 --> 03:17:30.320]  okay well you're on a phone line that's in minnesota we're here in texas
[03:17:30.320 --> 03:17:34.480]  uh but uh no it's fine do it live on air it's fine
[03:17:34.480 --> 03:17:38.720]  all right well basically if you um if you go one two
[03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:44.800]  three four five uh five uh uh how can i say squares on the
[03:17:44.800 --> 03:17:50.960]  right hand side and then uh there's a uh there's a
[03:17:50.960 --> 03:17:54.800]  how can i say a thing you can click on there um and then
[03:17:54.800 --> 03:17:59.920]  there is a uh right uh on the right hand side on the
[03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:03.680]  lower right hand side there's a uh signal that you can click on that
[03:18:03.680 --> 03:18:08.160]  goes to um uh where you can get information
[03:18:08.160 --> 03:18:11.200]  for the you know basically for the emergency
[03:18:11.200 --> 03:18:17.760]  and um and click on that yeah we're in that it seems hidden continue
[03:18:17.760 --> 03:18:23.840]  oh gosh can you email us the actual sub url
[03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:27.440]  only because we're running out of time in broadcast i'd be calm and i meant to
[03:18:27.440 --> 03:18:30.400]  do this the last few days i could literally kick myself but where's the
[03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:34.240]  mainstream news they just let the federal government of japan
[03:18:34.240 --> 03:18:38.080]  give them no information so they say we don't know and now i'm here floundering
[03:18:38.080 --> 03:18:41.040]  around doing the job that the u.s military should be doing
[03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:48.160]  dr bowman what's your take on this well i i'd say keep at it and dig for that
[03:18:48.160 --> 03:18:53.360]  information uh i i'm not you know i think what you
[03:18:53.360 --> 03:18:57.280]  find will be better than what we've been getting from the federal government
[03:18:57.280 --> 03:19:01.920]  but it's still not not be everything uh but uh
[03:19:01.920 --> 03:19:07.680]  keep at it uh the bottom line i think is that uh
[03:19:07.680 --> 03:19:16.960]  the japanese people uh are in enormous danger and uh
[03:19:16.960 --> 03:19:22.240]  i i think uh if i was over there and i didn't have something i had to do or
[03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:26.640]  wasn't going to be useful in saving lives uh i think i'd leave
[03:19:26.640 --> 03:19:29.680]  well they've certainly been doing that uh we're going to come back in a final
[03:19:29.680 --> 03:19:33.840]  segment with dr bob bowman and i appreciate all of jack's help uh stay
[03:19:33.840 --> 03:19:37.920]  with us jack but i want to ask this question to dr bowman
[03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:44.800]  we had uh dr christ busby a chemical physicist on who's an advisor to the bbc
[03:19:44.800 --> 03:19:48.000]  he said this is a cover-up meltdown has probably already occurred
[03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:52.400]  bigger than a heritage uh bigger than chernobyl as you said doctor
[03:19:52.400 --> 03:19:58.160]  and and he went on to to talk about the internalization of the radiation
[03:19:58.160 --> 03:20:03.120]  and how the nuclear industry spends that i'm gonna talk to you doctor
[03:20:03.120 --> 03:20:07.520]  alex has told you that the mid-east uprisings over food prices and shortages
[03:20:07.520 --> 03:20:11.440]  caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide we're seeing the impact right
[03:20:11.440 --> 03:20:15.360]  here in the united states ethanol that was supposed to reduce petroleum use
[03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:20.080]  and fuel prices hit a 30 month high in february and pump prices are expected
[03:20:20.080 --> 03:20:24.640]  to reach five dollars a gallon because of shipping costs food is being priced
[03:20:24.640 --> 03:20:27.760]  out of the reach of millions of americans with an expected 35
[03:20:27.760 --> 03:20:32.000]  percent jump in the next 60 days move quickly while you could still afford

[03:22:20.400 --> 03:22:24.960]  you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[03:22:24.960 --> 03:22:28.800]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure
[03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:32.240]  if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:35.840]  for the realists there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:39.600]  with gold since 2001 the us dollar index has tanked
[03:22:39.600 --> 03:22:44.080]  30 percent while gold has risen 300 percent right now savvy investors are
[03:22:44.080 --> 03:22:48.000]  adding gold to their portfolios you should too find out what they know

[03:23:01.600 --> 03:23:06.800]  david j smith for news watch magazine did you know that the united nations is
[03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:10.880]  a trojan horse and that the secretary general of the united
[03:23:10.880 --> 03:23:15.200]  nations has always been a socialist from the day that it was founded
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:19.440]  therefore it can only bring about a one world communist government
[03:23:19.440 --> 03:23:23.680]  do you realize that they will be in charge of all weaponry
[03:23:23.680 --> 03:23:27.760]  if the united states and every other nation turns over to it
[03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:31.440]  any nation that rebels they will just send the nuclear weapon

[03:24:18.720 --> 03:24:23.360]  dot com for announcements don't forget dr bob bowman's excellent website the
[03:24:23.360 --> 03:24:28.080]  patriots dot us and we'll continue to have dr bob bowman another
[03:24:28.080 --> 03:24:31.040]  physicist nuclear physicist on the broadcast
[03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:35.760]  the retransmissions coming up in a moment with dr christ busby incredible
[03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:38.960]  hour very informative we did with him and all the
[03:24:38.960 --> 03:24:42.640]  latest will be covered after the break but dr bob bowman
[03:24:42.640 --> 03:24:46.880]  looking at this and what's coming towards the west
[03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:51.760]  and the the level of the cover up can can you describe to people
[03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:56.080]  what what dr doug rocky's talked about dr christ busby's talked about both
[03:24:56.080 --> 03:24:58.960]  physicists that that the nuclear industry has a
[03:24:58.960 --> 03:25:02.080]  false gauge saying well it's two it's ten it's 20 times
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:05.360]  you know what safe levels that might hit the u.s but that's no big deal it's
[03:25:05.360 --> 03:25:08.960]  like sunshine well no you're ingesting these particles
[03:25:08.960 --> 03:25:13.600]  and these doctors were saying that's what's so devastating is that correct
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:18.480]  yeah it's if you ingest the particle if you breathe it in
[03:25:18.480 --> 03:25:24.960]  that is what is difficult and dangerous now
[03:25:24.960 --> 03:25:29.120]  most of the radiation of course will fall in the ocean some will fall on the
[03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:33.440]  land might possibly get into the food chain
[03:25:33.440 --> 03:25:40.640]  uh breathing it in is uh sort of hard to do when
[03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:47.120]  there's so little of it falling out and uh
[03:25:47.120 --> 03:25:51.520]  how much has gotten into the jet stream now probably not much
[03:25:51.520 --> 03:25:55.040]  the explosions have not gone very high that
[03:25:55.040 --> 03:26:00.480]  got a few thousand feet you have to send that stuff up to 30 35 thousand feet
[03:26:00.480 --> 03:26:04.640]  before it gets caught in the jet stream so
[03:26:04.640 --> 03:26:13.200]  uh yeah if you're concerned wear a mask just one of these paper masks
[03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:19.440]  uh that will make a huge difference and then also if anybody could get potassium
[03:26:19.440 --> 03:26:22.880]  iodate consult your doctor of course but once
[03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:26.560]  once radiation levels did go up it would be advisable to take that correct
[03:26:26.560 --> 03:26:31.840]  doctor once the radiation levels are up
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:35.520]  uh you know a couple hundred times normal or
[03:26:35.520 --> 03:26:38.960]  more than that or there's any indication of
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:43.280]  radiation sickness that's the time to take it all right Dr Bob Bowman
[03:26:43.280 --> 03:26:47.040]  we will talk to you again in the very near future thank you for spending so
[03:26:47.040 --> 03:26:51.120]  much time with us we're very thankful okay maybe next time we can talk about
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:55.120]  other stuff like the wars in 9 11 and all the rest of it yes sir we do cover
[03:26:55.120 --> 03:26:57.920]  all of that here as you know yeah you bet
[03:26:57.920 --> 03:27:00.800]  absolutely and hopefully you're becoming to austin april we'll have you in
[03:27:00.800 --> 03:27:03.520]  studio take care of my friend great bye bye
[03:27:03.520 --> 03:27:08.640]  we've got some other shocking news here uh this being reported out of fox
[03:27:08.640 --> 03:27:14.880]  television in dc windows at washington dc republican office shot out
[03:27:14.880 --> 03:27:18.320]  there've been a lot of death threats by the union connected people
[03:27:18.320 --> 03:27:23.200]  against republicans as of late the msnbc's been hailing all of the vitriol
[03:27:23.200 --> 03:27:26.960]  but when but when the key part of people just protest they call it violent and
[03:27:26.960 --> 03:27:29.840]  dangerous police are searching for suspects that were someone shot out
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:33.680]  windows at a republican office in the district police say the vandalism
[03:27:33.680 --> 03:27:36.960]  occurred Tuesday night all the windows of the office were damaged the
[03:27:36.960 --> 03:27:40.880]  executive director republican committee says an air gun was probably used so
[03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:44.160]  that's good news that it was just a bb gun could have just been vandalism or
[03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:48.080]  could have been a dumb kid in fact that's what the mo i would say
[03:27:48.080 --> 03:27:52.960]  type of person that would do it also
[03:27:52.960 --> 03:27:57.600]  regular potassium iodine drops and things only give you thyroid help from
[03:27:57.600 --> 03:28:00.240]  the doctors and pharmacists we've interviewed they only make sure you
[03:28:00.240 --> 03:28:03.440]  have a healthy thyroid and might keep you from absorbing some of the radiation
[03:28:03.440 --> 03:28:08.880]  but i can't give medical advice i am about 98 percent sure we can get it if
[03:28:08.880 --> 03:28:12.640]  we want that because it happens being texas
[03:28:12.640 --> 03:28:16.480]  the only known supply of potassium iodate in the country
[03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:19.440]  um that is readily packaged and available
[03:28:19.440 --> 03:28:22.720]  it's a group that sells the mainline pills the government itself but also
[03:28:22.720 --> 03:28:26.400]  puts together these other types that is the raw
[03:28:26.400 --> 03:28:30.080]  iodine but in the proper dosage we're there researching it happens to be in
[03:28:30.080 --> 03:28:34.080]  texas gonzalez our people are there now
[03:28:34.080 --> 03:28:37.840]  look for that at info wars dot com this evening but there's not going to be that
[03:28:37.840 --> 03:28:41.440]  much of it because it's almost all gone this happened because my staff was
[03:28:41.440 --> 03:28:45.120]  looking for it for themselves i have pills i bought years ago
[03:28:45.120 --> 03:28:48.640]  a decade ago they were all basically expired but i've talked to folks for
[03:28:48.640 --> 03:28:50.960]  myself personally looks like they would still work
[03:28:50.960 --> 03:28:54.080]  but my wife's not sure so we've been tearing things apart and found it right
[03:28:54.080 --> 03:28:57.760]  under our nose with folks we interviewed 11 12 years ago
[03:28:57.760 --> 03:29:00.800]  dealing with it uh and i'm probably going to get them on air their folks
[03:29:00.800 --> 03:29:05.520]  that also build nuclear detectors um reyman tex friends with them and
[03:29:05.520 --> 03:29:08.080]  worked with them in the past tried to get me into it 10 12 years ago about how
[03:29:08.080 --> 03:29:12.320]  dangerous reactors were but the point is is that we've got to have all the
[03:29:12.320 --> 03:29:15.680]  inserts and the facts and you got to get your medical advice first we're not
[03:29:15.680 --> 03:29:19.280]  doing that but it's something legally sold all over the country but it's gone
[03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:23.600]  and so look for that at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we also have
[03:29:23.600 --> 03:29:28.080]  the dulce uh and uh seaweed based uh iodine pills
[03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:32.400]  available at info wars team dot com but again that's just for regular health
[03:29:32.400 --> 03:29:36.080]  folks i i i and the whole point is with this iodine
[03:29:36.080 --> 03:29:39.200]  stuff is you don't take it till the irradiation's here and you know what's
[03:29:39.200 --> 03:29:41.600]  going on according to dr bob bowman he's a doctor in
[03:29:41.600 --> 03:29:44.400]  physicists so i'll listen to him but you take your own advice your own
[03:29:44.400 --> 03:29:48.880]  research key retransmission coming up now info wars dot com and on the radio
[03:29:48.880 --> 03:30:06.720]  stations and then dr chris busby key info coming up
