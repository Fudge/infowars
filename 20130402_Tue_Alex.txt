[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:22.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.080 --> 00:29.400]  ladies and gentlemen the war for our liberties is on and we know this if we
[00:29.400 --> 00:35.440]  counter in fear if we submit to the tyranny if we give into it things will
[00:35.440 --> 00:40.080]  accelerate and be a lot worse than they will be if we stand up if we say no if
[00:40.080 --> 00:45.840]  we block the system at every level we now have a completely illegitimate
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.680]  federal government engaged in every type of criminal activity known to man in
[00:50.680 --> 00:55.160]  front of us it openly works for foreign megabanks who want to take our private
[00:55.160 --> 00:59.920]  bank accounts pension funds and what's left of our industry and basically shut
[00:59.920 --> 01:05.840]  it all down as a tool of total control then they can come back in with all
[01:05.840 --> 01:12.000]  their fiat currency their SDRs their global cashless currency and buy
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.040]  everything up at the barrel of a gun homeland security type systems have been
[01:18.040 --> 01:22.080]  set up everywhere the globalists are in control and everywhere they're in
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.200]  control they have paramilitary police and even foreign mercenaries in the case of
[01:26.200 --> 01:35.400]  Cyprus and Greece EU mercs security guards they're called with MP4 HK
[01:35.400 --> 01:41.200]  submachine guns guarding the banks so that no one can go in as the money is
[01:41.200 --> 01:46.960]  wired and siphoned out all of the elite the Russian mafia the globalist mafia
[01:46.960 --> 01:52.080]  the Bankster mafia the insiders the regular mafia for months it's now out
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.320]  in the news they took billions out they're taking retired auto mechanics
[01:58.320 --> 02:03.080]  and police officers pensions and the police that still have their jobs are
[02:03.080 --> 02:09.320]  there helping all of this happen in fact I was on our Twitter this morning real
[02:09.320 --> 02:14.840]  Alex Jones and I saw the cartoon there perhaps you guys can punch that up it's
[02:14.840 --> 02:21.960]  in the image section of a line of police blocking a bunch of protesters in
[02:21.960 --> 02:28.080]  Europe and it shows you know classic Monopoly man type top hat bankers walking
[02:28.080 --> 02:32.120]  and they're saying gee I hope the cops don't find out we've stolen their
[02:32.120 --> 02:39.680]  pension funds yeah there it is I'm just hoping we can keep this whole thing
[02:39.680 --> 02:45.840]  under control after the police find out we're stealing their pensions and that's
[02:45.840 --> 02:50.600]  what happened in Russia it's what happened in Chichescus Romania it's what
[02:50.600 --> 02:56.560]  I'd see if it's what's happened most places the globalist are going to kill
[02:56.560 --> 03:03.400]  the Golden Goose all of us have a responsibility to realize 92 on average
[03:03.400 --> 03:08.000]  percent of the global debt that they're signing Portugal and Greece and Spain and
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.840]  the US and Australia and Iceland on to some places it's 95 percent some it's
[03:13.840 --> 03:21.000]  89% on average it's 92% of the debt is not ours we were signed on to the
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.440]  derivatives and here's the best part I know I say this every day because it's
[03:24.440 --> 03:29.600]  the answer to everything the media the collaborator media that calls looting
[03:29.600 --> 03:34.960]  people's bank accounts in Europe a bailout oh a tough bailout now they
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.600]  won't even say on the news what's happening over there you can tell the
[03:38.600 --> 03:45.040]  orders have gone out I was watching Fox Business and I was seeing people on
[03:45.040 --> 03:49.080]  there that would never have said this is okay that are saying it's okay because
[03:49.080 --> 03:53.760]  they've been told you could see the talking point you get on board with
[03:53.760 --> 03:58.840]  this or you're off the air we don't care how high your ratings are plus they
[03:58.840 --> 04:02.960]  got the Justice Department breathing down the neck of Rupert Murdoch they'll
[04:02.960 --> 04:08.240]  indict his butt and arrest his butt if he didn't play ball and and that's why
[04:08.240 --> 04:12.240]  you're seeing Republican leadership come out for gun control that's why you're
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.880]  seeing all this because the screws are being applied and folks if we roll over
[04:16.880 --> 04:27.640]  to the screws can you say it's over two words it's over it's over it's over now
[04:27.640 --> 04:32.080]  I want to give you the full-out assault from Colorado to Connecticut the
[04:32.080 --> 04:37.000]  outright gun bans that are happening and when there's the next event staged or
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.640]  provocateur or naturally occurring we are scripted to be blamed also they are
[04:41.640 --> 04:44.680]  raiding and arresting veterans everywhere there is a nine of the long
[04:44.680 --> 04:49.720]  knives push this always happens people are like I can't believe they say the
[04:49.720 --> 04:54.040]  new terrorists aren't al-qaeda their veterans of course they are I told you

[08:49.880 --> 08:55.800]  wars nightly news at info wars news dot com and prison planet dot TV and I will
[08:55.800 --> 08:59.480]  be hosting the news tonight and the interview portion of the nightly news
[08:59.480 --> 09:05.120]  will be conducted by David Knight tonight no pun intended
[09:05.120 --> 09:10.920]  wow here we are it's all unfolding so what do we do about it we discredit the
[09:10.920 --> 09:16.520]  system we expose it and we nullify it and we point out that all laws that are
[09:16.520 --> 09:22.560]  unconstitutional and repugnant to common law are no and void I saw a big
[09:22.560 --> 09:27.240]  federal court ruling yesterday where they declared the common law dead when
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.080]  the common law is what the bill of rights constitution and common sense
[09:31.080 --> 09:36.240]  springs from this is a criminal what you're witnessing is a criminal
[09:36.240 --> 09:41.880]  revolution and everyone is now realizing that I talked to that you don't
[09:41.880 --> 09:47.000]  put perfume on a pig that that that that the worst-case scenario is now
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.640]  unfolding and that we are indeed in deep trouble in fact I'm seeing hardly
[09:52.640 --> 09:58.720]  anyone out there who is in denial now but I am seeing something very
[09:58.720 --> 10:03.040]  disgusting that I knew we would see and I've said this for many years studying
[10:03.040 --> 10:07.840]  history humans repeat the same activities over and over again rarely do we
[10:07.840 --> 10:16.040]  learn from serious mistakes of the past and head them off at the past before we
[10:16.040 --> 10:25.760]  repeat the full horror of the total state nightmare but looking at what is
[10:25.760 --> 10:32.320]  unfolding you have masses of people awakening what they tend to get depressed
[10:32.320 --> 10:39.360]  they tend to go into despair and just pull into themselves and quite frankly I
[10:39.360 --> 10:42.520]  don't blame them but that is not the path to victory and it's not the path to
[10:42.520 --> 10:48.040]  enlightenment it's not the path to empowerment it's not the path to the
[10:48.040 --> 10:53.840]  great challenge that is our age we should be honored and I and I'll be honest
[10:53.840 --> 11:00.280]  with you thinking our lucky stars to be alive in a time such as this because when
[11:00.280 --> 11:08.600]  you look to the people and on to the political mist to the truly powerful in
[11:08.600 --> 11:14.680]  their high places they are scared of humanity they are scared of the light of
[11:14.680 --> 11:18.600]  liberty that we carry in our hearts and minds that is only a reflection of the
[11:18.600 --> 11:24.920]  great Creator and they are the ones that are worried and they should be so
[11:24.920 --> 11:32.120]  never forget despite how powerful the enemy is if you pull back there are
[11:32.120 --> 11:35.640]  things much greater in this universe when you're standing up against the
[11:35.640 --> 11:41.720]  Leviathan the the mountain of corruption and all its pumps all its dupes all its
[11:41.720 --> 11:48.680]  sycophantic servants all its minions and it looks unstoppable and huge pull back
[11:48.680 --> 11:55.440]  and look above the mountain and then you will see he that created the universe
[11:55.440 --> 12:04.480]  and that's who we stand with now that said there is a great awakening
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.720]  happening not just here but on a planetary scale all of us are leaders
[12:09.720 --> 12:14.160]  in the fight for human dignity and truth and justice and all the things that
[12:14.160 --> 12:24.080]  have become almost forgotten the cynical scorn it the evil depend on you not
[12:24.080 --> 12:30.480]  realizing your potential but there's not just those that are joining with good
[12:30.480 --> 12:34.560]  there are not just those that are choosing sides right now and choosing
[12:34.560 --> 12:42.800]  the right side there are many that have chosen through fear through a love of
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.920]  sadism through a lust of power that they don't understand through the worship
[12:47.920 --> 12:54.040]  of evil and corruption
[12:55.800 --> 13:03.560]  there are many that have chosen to join with the forces of global governance and
[13:03.560 --> 13:14.240]  the dark cult of genocide the dark cult of democide the cryptocracies the
[13:14.240 --> 13:26.400]  kleptocracies that make up the kingdom of this world they have chosen they
[13:26.400 --> 13:36.280]  believe wisely to join with the new world order they have chosen to sing their
[13:36.280 --> 13:38.960]  love song
[13:39.840 --> 13:50.040]  to all that is bad they are nuzzling up against the downy breast feathers
[13:50.040 --> 14:00.840]  under the dark wings of the new world order and they are fed on the
[14:00.840 --> 14:06.840]  expropriated wealth eaten up by the great bird of prey and a vomited back
[14:06.840 --> 14:13.600]  down on its children sometimes I do get depressed or not even depressed I get in
[14:13.600 --> 14:24.760]  a dark mood realizing that this is only the beginning of the rise of evil and
[14:24.760 --> 14:29.560]  that we're going to have to watch even more of the innocent and the defenseless
[14:29.560 --> 14:39.920]  overrun and trampled in the dirt by these vipers and so there is a great
[14:39.920 --> 14:46.280]  frustration that the best of us are cheerful and meek and do not see
[14:46.280 --> 14:54.640]  themselves as leaders and so we'll not take the field against the globalist but
[14:54.640 --> 14:58.240]  whether it is a foregone conclusion that evil overtake the world in a
[14:58.240 --> 15:13.440]  technocratic technotronic technocracy nightmare it is still our test to
[15:13.440 --> 15:20.040]  decide which side we will be on and I would tell you choose wisely think hard
[15:20.040 --> 15:24.280]  and think deep but don't be lukewarm about this decision because you are the
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.760]  people in the middle of the road that are overrun you are simply the food in
[15:29.760 --> 15:36.920]  this fight you are not respected by either side I respect evil though I
[15:36.920 --> 15:43.880]  disdain it and disgust it I respect its power and I know its will and evil
[15:43.880 --> 15:49.920]  respects those of us that are awake and see it and that is a far better
[15:49.920 --> 15:56.080]  position to be in than on the fence I want to warn those of you that know
[15:56.080 --> 16:00.480]  that this great time of judgment is coming upon us who think you're going
[16:00.480 --> 16:06.720]  to sit on the sidelines you are sitting in the most dangerous position because
[16:06.720 --> 16:15.520]  the food is in the bleachers you are in the game you are on the field whether
[16:15.520 --> 16:22.560]  you sit there on your butt your spiritual hind in or not and if you don't
[16:22.560 --> 16:30.160]  have an over-driving animating spirit of resistance against evil if you aren't
[16:30.160 --> 16:37.200]  burning with a desire to confront these people I want to give you the news flash
[16:37.200 --> 16:45.920]  you've already chosen a side I went to a big mega church here in town that my
[16:45.920 --> 16:53.160]  wife likes it's pretty good church overall with Dave Mustaine and his family
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.840]  when they were here visiting us on Easter and I saw the preacher during a
[16:59.840 --> 17:04.000]  break got the word that I was in the audience and they were looking at Dave
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  too and I could see them looking and then afterwards we're waiting to pick up my
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.160]  children at Sunday school and to leave and I saw the assistant preacher the
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.840]  sheriff's deputy and the head preacher and they didn't come over to us and they
[17:17.840 --> 17:24.080]  looked like they were scared of us and you know because everybody's got their
[17:24.080 --> 17:28.360]  own little happy thing going and you know people that are smart enough to
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.640]  give a good sermon are smart enough to know how the world really works and
[17:32.640 --> 17:37.000]  is smart enough to know I judge the official church I don't say I don't
[17:37.000 --> 17:47.680]  judge your soul I judge its fruits and it it it it is not calling people to
[17:47.680 --> 17:53.000]  confront the powerful evil in this world that church I was going to does call
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.120]  people to be world changers and go out there and be the light in the world
[17:56.120 --> 17:59.760]  assault in the world which is good most establishment churches don't even do that
[17:59.760 --> 18:11.320]  now but so many people think that well I'm making things bad or when I talk
[18:11.320 --> 18:16.800]  about things it's manifesting it that's not how the world really works you can
[18:16.800 --> 18:20.400]  have an idea and then build it and manifest it I'm here talking about
[18:20.400 --> 18:38.880]  these things to warn you because God helps those that helps themselves people
[18:38.880 --> 18:49.600]  should be totally committed and given over to resisting this right now I
[18:49.600 --> 18:55.520]  mean the corruption is off the charts the government is devaluing your savings
[18:55.520 --> 19:02.040]  right now that's why commodities are all going up from oil to gas to all their
[19:02.040 --> 19:08.120]  forms of energy food you name it we're being robbed here like they're being
[19:08.120 --> 19:12.040]  robbed in Europe just in a different way and they're moving and announcing
[19:12.040 --> 19:15.680]  they're going to take your pension funds public and private they're going to take
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.320]  the money out of your bank accounts at one point or another probably sooner
[19:19.320 --> 19:23.240]  rather than later this is all going to happen the whole system set up for
[19:23.240 --> 19:28.840]  capital controls and capital flight controls when you try to fly if you've
[19:28.840 --> 19:32.480]  got a thousand dollars in your bag they pull it out and look at it's what's got
[19:32.480 --> 19:36.440]  strips in it if you've got three silver dollars they take them from you but the
[19:36.440 --> 19:40.880]  the the TSA's training for highway checkpoints border checkpoints where
[19:40.880 --> 19:45.080]  you're not going to get out they're coming for the guns so that you can't
[19:45.080 --> 19:48.760]  defend yourself because they're gonna do things so horrible they know you're
[19:48.760 --> 19:54.040]  going to resist they're now purging veterans raiding them nationwide taking

[24:22.040 --> 24:27.320]  down and destroyed in many areas of the United States as they've taken guns
[24:27.320 --> 24:31.800]  everywhere else in the world or one of the last countries you need to understand
[24:31.800 --> 24:36.040]  fools that the system is going to take your free speech it's going to take your

[24:41.120 --> 24:45.800]  going to take your health that is the eugenics population reduction plan and
[24:45.800 --> 24:55.520]  it is a delusion to believe that ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine

[25:01.160 --> 25:07.400]  you are out of your minds to believe you're on a winning team because you've
[25:07.400 --> 25:11.720]  not only got people that are deciding to wake up and fight evil now because it's
[25:11.720 --> 25:17.840]  so historically obvious you've got people deciding to join it and I see them on
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.360]  television I talk to them I run into them because I'm in the position that most
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.600]  of you aren't where I'm well known now and so I get to have these people now
[25:26.600 --> 25:31.760]  at public places walk up to me and tell me you bet we're taking over you bet
[25:31.760 --> 25:37.200]  we're winning and you're gonna get it and I'm like well who are you are you a
[25:37.200 --> 25:44.640]  billionaire globalist you're gonna get it to you stupid idiot and I have told
[25:44.640 --> 25:49.320]  the police and military I told you this 11 years ago when they set up homeland
[25:49.320 --> 25:53.040]  security I said they're gonna flip this from al-qaeda to gun owners
[25:53.040 --> 25:58.320]  conservatives libertarians veterans and state and local police who don't become
[25:58.320 --> 26:02.920]  federalized and don't play ball you're gonna not just get kicked out of the
[26:02.920 --> 26:10.280]  police force they're going to come and arrest you unless America is the one
[26:10.280 --> 26:12.240]  exception out of every other place
[26:12.240 --> 26:15.800]  authoritarians have taken over what do you think happened when a new Caesar would
[26:15.800 --> 26:20.320]  come in kill his cousin kill his brother kill his dad you know happened all the
[26:20.320 --> 26:27.880]  time what do you think happened to the entire leadership of the Roman military
[26:27.880 --> 26:36.280]  and the centurions internationally and then domestically the petroleum that's
[26:36.280 --> 26:41.320]  the federal police what do you think happened your throat's got slit you got
[26:41.320 --> 26:49.480]  thrown in the arena your fools fools fools from the foundations of the earth
[26:49.480 --> 26:54.360]  you get rid of due process you might as well burn your own house down and the
[26:54.360 --> 27:08.040]  articles are pouring in absolutely pouring in to my offices and they're up
[27:08.040 --> 27:15.560]  on info wars.com right now veterans guns confiscated after forced
[27:15.560 --> 27:25.360]  psychiatric evaluation Navy veteran no criminal record honorably discharged had
[27:25.360 --> 27:34.800]  done absolutely nothing wrong and it's all on record here and the police came
[27:34.800 --> 27:41.440]  and grabbed him threw him in the hospital at him forcibly evaluated and he
[27:41.440 --> 27:44.280]  thought that what was happening to him was wrong so you think the government's
[27:44.280 --> 27:47.360]  corrupt that's proof of the mental illness and all his guns have been taken
[27:47.360 --> 27:53.080]  and his concealed carry quote permit and then he was charged for the hospital
[27:53.080 --> 28:02.280]  stay and this is happening all over the country and they're saying Diane Feinstein
[28:02.280 --> 28:06.800]  said two weeks ago in Congress in the Senate hearing she said no we can't have
[28:06.800 --> 28:11.240]  an exemption from these gun laws for police and military even when they're
[28:11.240 --> 28:14.760]  retired why they're some of the most mentally ill people out there so as a
[28:14.760 --> 28:21.520]  group they're saying as even though statistically retired police retired
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.640]  military have some of the lowest crime rates you can pull up the numbers FBI.gov
[28:25.640 --> 28:31.040]  there's a group you're guilty how do you like that how do you like it police who
[28:31.040 --> 28:34.720]  for five six years have been getting the internal stuff where veterans gun owners
[28:34.720 --> 28:41.440]  conservatives they're saying of the terrorists returning veterans now it's you
[28:41.440 --> 28:45.400]  and it's going to be you and as soon as you get off the force or as soon as you
[28:45.400 --> 28:48.680]  retire or soon as you get disabled they're gonna take what you've got as
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.960]  well and then when the UN finally takes over under State Department plan and UN
[28:52.960 --> 28:59.720]  international treaty and public law 7277 that's an executive order that
[28:59.720 --> 29:06.360]  becomes law by bureaucratic fiat under 7277 go read it and go look at the
[29:06.360 --> 29:10.840]  graphics it shows our military being phased down to nothing as the UN NATO
[29:10.840 --> 29:14.880]  military is built up our helmets get little in the graph their helmets get
[29:14.880 --> 29:21.360]  big in the graph and then when they're finally done making you hate the police
[29:21.360 --> 29:24.760]  and the revolution and the takeover the globalists are in the revolution they're
[29:24.760 --> 29:30.400]  then going to disarm all the police as well and all you'll have is big UN
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.880]  green zone command cities that run the deindustrialization shutting down the
[29:35.880 --> 29:41.840]  agricultural systems and run the extermination Iraq was a model 1,200,000

[33:33.960 --> 33:51.320]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live thanks for joining us on this Tuesday
[33:51.320 --> 34:02.840]  edition already the second day of April 2013 all right here's what I want to do
[34:02.840 --> 34:06.280]  I want to get into the second amendment news the economic news the geopolitical
[34:06.280 --> 34:10.280]  news the police state news and some other key information and then we're going
[34:10.280 --> 34:16.360]  to have completely open phones interspersed with a special report in
[34:16.360 --> 34:21.520]  the second hour and then a friend of mine Eddie Craig is also a talk show
[34:21.520 --> 34:26.360]  host and he's a Nacodotus sheriff's deputy who saw massive corruption and
[34:26.360 --> 34:30.960]  quit over it and exposed it and then now just cleans the clocks of corrupt
[34:30.960 --> 34:35.680]  police bureaucrats and judges all over the state of Texas and teaches very
[34:35.680 --> 34:40.280]  popular classes on the Bill of Rights and Constitution he's going to be
[34:40.280 --> 34:44.920]  joining us to talk about that line in the sand that police are gonna have to
[34:44.920 --> 34:49.280]  ask themselves how many unlawful orders are you gonna follow because you will be
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.800]  where the rubber meets the road and a revolution against liberty will be like
[34:53.800 --> 34:59.160]  a car or a truck driving down a highway with spikes all over it and you're the
[34:59.160 --> 35:03.720]  tires now the globalist up top they're not too worried about it they don't care
[35:03.720 --> 35:08.360]  if they're driving on the rims with sparks shooting out the sides but you had
[35:08.360 --> 35:14.240]  better you you want to be afraid of something I'm afraid of it I'm afraid
[35:14.240 --> 35:19.480]  of letting it get that far I'm not physically afraid any of this I'm
[35:19.480 --> 35:23.520]  certainly not looking forward to it if it goes into full bore gun battles all
[35:23.520 --> 35:27.640]  up in the place because then it's going to be open season and the
[35:27.640 --> 35:33.040]  establishment will commit atrocities and the public will take the gloves off and
[35:33.040 --> 35:37.200]  the establishment will commit atrocities and blaming on us it won't matter
[35:37.200 --> 35:40.480]  that then the gloves will be off everybody knows the foreign banks are
[35:40.480 --> 35:44.560]  staging the terror attacks everybody who counts who can rub two brain cells
[35:44.560 --> 35:48.760]  together knows the new world order staged Oklahoma City everybody knows
[35:48.760 --> 35:53.800]  about Operation Gladio and Ajax and Gulf of Tonkin and Operation Northwood's
[35:53.800 --> 35:58.440]  everybody that counts does everybody I talked to in the Navy Seals and Delta
[35:58.440 --> 36:08.440]  Force in the Army everybody I talked to in the CIA retired everybody I talked to
[36:08.440 --> 36:15.520]  everybody knows as the song goes everybody knows that the dice were
[36:15.520 --> 36:24.040]  loaded everyone rolls with their fingers crossed everybody knows the war is
[36:24.040 --> 36:31.760]  over everybody knows the good guys lost
[36:36.920 --> 36:43.600]  are we going to admit that to ourselves so that we can set about taking
[36:43.600 --> 36:48.160]  humanity back from the clutches of the globalist or are we going to live in
[36:48.160 --> 36:55.200]  denial that my friends is up to you
[36:58.400 --> 37:02.000]  but this is the great test art enough of the preaching I'm gonna get to the
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.720]  news when I open the phones up I want to get your take on ways to take back the
[37:07.720 --> 37:13.560]  Republic ways to defend the Second Amendment what you're planning to do when
[37:13.560 --> 37:17.760]  they pull you over and search your car or you come home and they've searched your
[37:17.760 --> 37:21.560]  house and they say we have a record of that 30 round mag you didn't turn in
[37:21.560 --> 37:28.240]  you're charged with a felony are you going to comply and turn all the guns
[37:28.240 --> 37:34.000]  in because then they'll ban the other guns you see once you pass the test
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.640]  once they can take 10% out of your Cyprus accounts first it was 7.7 then
[37:39.640 --> 37:47.960]  it was 9.9 then it was 10.2 then it was 14.5 then it was 35% 40% 60 70 80 now
[37:47.960 --> 37:57.160]  they're just saying we're taking all the money out I laugh cuz man this isn't
[37:57.160 --> 38:01.920]  hard to figure out how this works you lay down to a bunch of wolves they're
[38:01.920 --> 38:10.640]  gonna tear our guts out and I am sick of being nice guy and putting up with all
[38:10.640 --> 38:15.640]  this bull while a bunch of criminals run all over us and walk all over us and
[38:15.640 --> 38:20.920]  tell the world that the good guys are the bad guys that's when you know you're
[38:20.920 --> 38:27.040]  two minutes to midnight is when they're killing the unborn in the womb and then
[38:27.040 --> 38:31.120]  they say let's start killing kids up to age three let's have death panels you're
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.600]  like that'll never happen it's the law they kill babies all over this country
[38:35.600 --> 38:40.600]  that are a year old two years old they've got people strapped down in local
[38:40.600 --> 38:46.000]  hospitals and nobody's coming to save them who who don't have any family and
[38:46.000 --> 38:52.200]  rewards of the state who can talk begging for water and when they don't die
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.040]  they remove the nurse and reprimand them and say I know you're given Mr. Johnson
[38:57.040 --> 39:01.440]  water I've had the nurses on I've had the Wall Street Journal writer best-selling
[39:01.440 --> 39:06.560]  author Wesley Smith on he's been there trying to give you a lot of hospitals
[39:06.560 --> 39:10.720]  who are going thank you for helping me you know the guy was slightly brain
[39:10.720 --> 39:15.160]  damaged paralyzed chest down was the was up to winlan case people let them kill
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.600]  me and then he was alive 30 days later when they said take the water and food
[39:19.600 --> 39:24.880]  so they just remove the nurses and put in the nurses that like to kill and then
[39:24.880 --> 39:28.480]  five six days later the tongue is cracking because all the water goes to
[39:28.480 --> 39:34.360]  the central organs and the blood starts coming out all the orifices the blood
[39:34.360 --> 39:36.960]  starts coming out of the cracks in the eyes the blood starts coming out of the
[39:36.960 --> 39:42.800]  gums and the people like please get me water please please please strap down
[39:42.800 --> 39:46.680]  and they got water in coming they're killing people all over the place every
[39:46.680 --> 39:54.040]  major hospital they're murdering people right now right now right now and now
[39:54.040 --> 39:57.800]  they come out the journal of bioethics that's the death panels the bioethics
[39:57.800 --> 40:03.960]  boards and they say federally appointed boards we're gonna start killing kids up
[40:03.960 --> 40:07.720]  to age three but if you spank your two-year-old who tries to open the
[40:07.720 --> 40:10.560]  back gate and go on the street for the fourth time they're gonna take your
[40:10.560 --> 40:14.680]  child because they love them
[40:14.680 --> 40:23.280]  they love killing them slow with a hundred plus vaccines they get by age
[40:23.280 --> 40:32.880]  five now they love bringing them up and watching you flounder watching you cry
[40:32.880 --> 40:37.240]  night after night as your autistic child has diarrhea and health problems and
[40:37.240 --> 40:43.600]  mental problems they feed on that pain and they intend it to continue the
[40:43.600 --> 40:47.440]  truth is they don't like to just kill kids right out in the open quickly they
[40:47.440 --> 40:53.200]  like to take their time and brain damage them while the television programs
[40:53.200 --> 40:58.960]  them with satanic brainwashing to hopefully get their souls isn't that
[40:58.960 --> 41:04.480]  just sweet isn't that sweet all of you that like evil all of you that like to
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.520]  play with evil you think it's gonna give you power but you've never really seen
[41:08.520 --> 41:12.000]  into evil and you don't know what it's really gonna do to you go ahead stick
[41:12.000 --> 41:20.120]  your arm in that dark hole go ahead work with the dark side go ahead you
[41:20.120 --> 41:27.480]  think there's power there you're like a moth to the flame of the black sunshine
[41:27.480 --> 41:43.560]  black sunshine rolling like a slug from a 45 true death a self-destructive
[41:43.560 --> 41:56.560]  fascination screaming to the edge of nothing nothing you see I get in here
[41:56.560 --> 42:00.880]  a little bit dark yesterday and I I don't go with it so that's what happens
[42:00.880 --> 42:04.680]  instead I'll just go with it today what do they say in Cheech and Chong's first
[42:04.680 --> 42:09.800]  movie and they're out there with the van and the pizzas and he goes look at you
[42:09.800 --> 42:15.960]  like what's happening he goes sir I get over he goes oh just go with it just go
[42:15.960 --> 42:29.040]  with it those of you that have decided to sign on to this are the biggest idiots
[42:29.040 --> 42:35.000]  you've got the whole birthright for life and liberty and justice and all that's
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.760]  good and you think evil and cheating is powerful you think lying to yourselves
[42:41.760 --> 42:51.480]  are powerful let me let me plug a couple things I'm gonna get to the news right
[42:51.480 --> 42:55.320]  now again you're listening the Alex Jones show if you just joined me I'm
[42:55.320 --> 42:59.960]  Marvel at the New World Order system I can't believe people can't see it aren't
[42:59.960 --> 43:04.400]  concerned about it and it's just so ridiculous that I do laugh occasionally
[43:04.400 --> 43:11.040]  because it's a defense mechanism it's a defense mechanism because I will get
[43:11.040 --> 43:15.960]  very very bummed out and you can't get bummed out in a depressing world while
[43:15.960 --> 43:21.880]  we have to take your guns from you especially if you're a veteran and so
[43:21.880 --> 43:27.600]  why not I mean I think it's reasonable and liberal to want to kill a 65 year
[43:27.600 --> 43:30.800]  old person just not giving many cancer treatment even though it's operable like
[43:30.800 --> 43:35.800]  to do in England I think that's great free healthcare I'm gonna imagine I'm on
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.920]  the winning team and you know what's wrong with killing healthy children up to
[43:39.920 --> 43:44.600]  age three they're not even saying kill you know kids that have birth defects or
[43:44.600 --> 43:49.640]  anything up to your age three they're saying kill let that let let parents
[43:49.640 --> 43:53.880]  kill their children they're like that'll never happen oh really it already goes on
[43:53.880 --> 43:58.200]  all over the place we broke that last year people didn't believe it even though
[43:58.200 --> 44:07.480]  it was in the Journal of Bioethics let me plug something here yeah now Planned
[44:07.480 --> 44:11.680]  Parenthood official argues for right to post birth abortion that was in the
[44:11.680 --> 44:16.560]  Florida legislature last week I mean what's the big deal she's wearing a suit
[44:16.560 --> 44:27.960]  I mean she's got nice jewelry she doesn't look like a gang banger I mean
[44:27.960 --> 44:32.440]  everybody knows that if you're wearing a sports jacket and a nice shirt and
[44:32.440 --> 44:39.000]  calling for dead babies I mean that's liberal and I could just imagine that
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.360]  I'm with them I would always like you to imagine I'm with the New World Order as
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.840]  they poison as they destroy my future as they do all this I just imagine I'm part
[44:46.840 --> 44:50.280]  of it and I turn on that I watch the state of the Union and look at Obama and
[44:50.280 --> 44:58.600]  oh he's he's for me oh he likes me oh oh I've got a newborn baby coming I'm gonna
[44:58.600 --> 45:02.640]  go give it a bunch of shots and then you know the babies 18 months old walking
[45:02.640 --> 45:05.440]  around getting a laugh and it gets the next round and then has convulsions and
[45:05.440 --> 45:12.560]  ever talks again but that's not the shots oh the government loves me the
[45:12.560 --> 45:18.840]  government is a loving group okay let me let me just stop the new magazine is
[45:18.840 --> 45:21.840]  out and it's selling very very quickly and of eight issues we've sold out I
[45:21.840 --> 45:25.760]  think five of them we've got a couple of the back issues because I printed an
[45:25.760 --> 45:29.360]  extra 10,000 of the revolution and they're trying to start the second
[45:29.360 --> 45:33.160]  American Revolution that they're controlling a kind of a Soviet style
[45:33.160 --> 45:41.160]  takeover and so I just want to encourage everyone who's out there to get
[45:41.160 --> 45:44.360]  the new hoax issue they can hopefully wake people up from the matrix that
[45:44.360 --> 45:47.520]  they're literally in an Alice in Wonderland level and it gets into the
[45:47.520 --> 45:50.360]  hoax on saying there's no bullets there's no drones there's no police state
[45:50.360 --> 45:54.800]  the vaccines don't hurt you and it covers the the big water crisis it
[45:54.800 --> 45:59.240]  covers democide with incredible graphics it covers attacks on the first
[45:59.240 --> 46:03.880]  amendment you know go back and pause that for TV viewers look at that photo
[46:03.880 --> 46:08.040]  right there no no going forward look at that photo of the guys in Austin all
[46:08.040 --> 46:11.320]  reading the info wars magazine when we had our street team handing them out
[46:11.320 --> 46:17.360]  that's a real photo when you actually look at it it looks like Norman Rockwell
[46:17.360 --> 46:23.000]  that photo you can't really see it all there because the page is bent but my
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.840]  point is you support true free speech and get the word out big color glossy

[54:05.920 --> 54:12.760]  alone on the hill I sit here and watch the globalist absolutely overturn all
[54:12.760 --> 54:17.840]  basic liberty here's the Washington Times article we have a new American
[54:17.840 --> 54:23.080]  article up at info wars.com but it's basically the same accurate info if you
[54:23.080 --> 54:25.840]  go to drudgereport.com we can punch that up for TV viewers
[54:25.840 --> 54:33.200]  UN goes for the guns and it says UN passes sweeping international arms
[54:33.200 --> 54:37.080]  regulation viewed by some as second-of-a-ment override I am an expert on
[54:37.080 --> 54:40.640]  the treaty and I've had Bob Dacey who writes the New American magazine who's
[54:40.640 --> 54:44.600]  an expert on it he's also a gun dealer a good friend of mine about 15 years and
[54:44.600 --> 54:50.640]  I've had the other lawyers on congressional advisors the UN thing
[54:50.640 --> 54:56.200]  legislation says states have the right to have guns but that's not individuals
[54:56.200 --> 55:02.040]  and then they they have little clauses that says you go to this meeting and the
[55:02.040 --> 55:06.120]  minutes of this for the interpretation and we've written countless articles on
[55:06.120 --> 55:10.080]  this if you want to pull them up the point is you then go read and it says
[55:10.080 --> 55:13.960]  that the civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power
[55:13.960 --> 55:17.280]  monopoly of the state and there must be a complete abolition of private
[55:17.280 --> 55:21.680]  ownership of any type of small arm including BB guns and other air-powered
[55:21.680 --> 55:30.240]  systems and that's Unideer July 7th 2001 certified in New York and added to the
[55:30.240 --> 55:35.600]  current current piece of global legislation what they don't want is
[55:35.600 --> 55:40.060]  third-world countries getting their own arms or citizens to fight back to UN
[55:40.060 --> 55:44.600]  and mercenary extermination operations I know you see Miss America up there
[55:44.600 --> 55:48.400]  saying I love the UN and shirts of little starving kids and all the UN's
[55:48.400 --> 55:51.760]  helping the UN's they're cutting their food off and then once they've already
[55:51.760 --> 55:56.360]  killed most of them they'll have a photo op giving some kids some food the UN and
[55:56.360 --> 56:02.280]  Rwanda helped kill a million people on record you can type in UN troops killing
[56:02.280 --> 56:07.360]  children and if you want them if you got the nerve to look at it it's
[56:07.360 --> 56:12.680]  barbecuing them raping them roasting them over fires beating their brains out
[56:12.680 --> 56:19.120]  they were there with machine guns set up when they had was the Hutus killing the
[56:19.120 --> 56:23.520]  Tootsies the Christian minority and then if they tried to get out of the camps
[56:23.520 --> 56:26.920]  they would run them to refugee camps the UN would then pull out and wait with
[56:26.920 --> 56:30.040]  heavy machine guns because they don't want to spend too many bullets a human's
[56:30.040 --> 56:34.440]  not worth a bullet and they would send in the one tribe to hack them up
[56:34.440 --> 56:38.680]  there's the Guardian UN troops stand by and watch carnage they'd stand by and
[56:38.680 --> 56:45.840]  watch they run the operations they run the operations I mean they go into
[56:45.840 --> 56:49.280]  villages in Africa and Latin America this is in the New York Times and they
[56:49.280 --> 56:56.720]  just line everybody up and just shoot them but again it's liberal I mean it's
[56:56.720 --> 57:03.520]  the UN Obama's a peace prize winner I mean look at Gaddafi bombing the whole
[57:03.520 --> 57:06.840]  country killing 40,000 blacks lining them up shooting them say you're not
[57:06.840 --> 57:09.320]  allowed to be in Libya you know this is Africa what do you think Africans live
[57:09.320 --> 57:14.560]  here I mean that's the kind of stuff going on and we've got to sit here while
[57:14.560 --> 57:17.840]  these criminals armed to the teeth against us and government arms of the
[57:17.840 --> 57:29.000]  teeth oh you and admits Rwanda genocide failure oh BBC well Hitler should have
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.560]  come out and said I'm leaving the bunker I'm not gonna get arrested I admit
[57:32.560 --> 57:41.920]  failure was what I did in the death camps it was an accident UN backed Congo
[57:41.920 --> 57:46.080]  troops kill more civilians than rebels says human rights watch that's even the
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.200]  Huffington Post having to admit that well that's AP on HuffPost surprise they
[57:50.200 --> 57:58.880]  even ran that well there I mean the UN is a mass murder machine and they say
[57:58.880 --> 58:03.040]  they're gonna take your guns why do you think national security agencies and
[58:03.040 --> 58:08.120]  groups were involved in the last two shootings guaranteed stage Colorado
[58:08.120 --> 58:12.560]  hands down their stage in all this stuff and they're gonna stage more this is

[1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:12.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:19.840]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:29.920]  Alex Jones well I'm gonna admit it all over the world the UN the pediatric
[1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:34.200]  journals the bioethics journals the death panels are calling for killing old
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:38.040]  people children anytime they want killing anybody in the state once you
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:40.960]  dead they just kill you even if you're totally healthy I think that's
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:44.040]  reasonable I think the state should be talking about how humans are scum and
[1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:46.680]  now they want to kill us I think it's good they're taking everybody's bank
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:49.640]  accounts now they're saying it's gonna take all the money out in Cyprus and
[1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:53.440]  they have foreign mercenaries flown in to guard the banks while the money's
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:57.160]  transferred out I think that's great I think it's good the Federal Reserve is
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:02.120]  devaluing the dollar right now and the 85 billion a month is given to foreign and
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:05.960]  offshore banks I think it's good that all the ultra-rich or totally tax-exempted
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:10.440]  pay-no-income tax or corporate tax on an offshore and I just think it's all
[1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:14.840]  wonderful and then Buffett does something on one little small accounting
[1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:21.080]  thing on some domestic money he has as a stunt I think that's sweet too I think
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:23.760]  it's good he shut down the pipeline that would have brought more oil and
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:29.240]  lowered gas prices here in the US out of Canada I think it's good that the
[1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:35.840]  Keystone pipeline was shut down and that's gonna be sent to China put that
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:42.200]  back on they all feel powerful for the state response Kim Jong-un ordering his
[1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:47.440]  forces to be poised to strike American targets other good people he has
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:01:51.160]  according to his state news they're not mindless to brainwash which that's how
[1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:55.120]  our government is US bases literally in the sites I had this guy tell me he's
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:01:58.400]  just basically a commie this photo is works for the government he's taking
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:03.920]  over the order it's complete with a map charts and the words look at that sack of
[1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:08.960]  crap and this may all seem bizarre to the outside world but it's designed for a
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:15.440]  domestic audience portraying strength and shoring up Kim's legitimacy it's all
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:19.760]  a direct response to the use by America of its stealth bombers yesterday during
[1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:24.680]  a joint exercise with the South the United States insists the use of nuclear
[1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:29.240]  capable aircraft was not intended to provoke the North but instead part of
[1:02:29.240 --> 1:02:34.040]  the planned exercise so you've got one little rotten state now so the big
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:37.200]  global rotten state that that has even better weapons because we had more
[1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:41.120]  liberty so they so they get to steal all that liberty and have an even bigger
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:45.240]  you know system to go menace other people and us because we're now paying
[1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:48.760]  for Homeland Security to get billions of bullets and armored vehicles and
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:54.560]  trained to confiscate our guns and then the minute they're done using the
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:58.920]  military to have a civil war and try to take our guns they're gonna take your
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:05.160]  guns it's like firing a gun that shoots your enemy but fires another bullet
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:10.280]  back at you it's not a good weapon to use everybody's so scared it's like
[1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:12.520]  North Korea we better do what the government says they're listening to

[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:28.960]  everyone likes what Obama's doing that's all a giant hoax only the weakest
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:32.960]  minds hear that and go oh that football team's winning I better get on the band
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:38.440]  wagon you're just a bandwagon fan well I've been a Dallas Cowboy fan since I
[1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:45.040]  was two years old what are you doing moving to Dallas like into cowboys I
[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:49.800]  grew up actually hearing talk like that and I thought it was stupid it's okay
[1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:55.200]  like a football game but like my whole life's about the Dallas Cowboys and you
[1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:59.320]  boy you better why it's the same thing with government I'm a winner cuz I'm
[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:06.640]  with Obama I get free health care you get free health care hmm oh that why the
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:09.680]  insurance companies wrote it you know what the insurance companies I went and
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:14.800]  looked you know what they're lobbying for in all 50 states you know what the
[1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:21.400]  insurance companies are lobbying for at the federal level just when what they
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:24.920]  want they get they are the big mega offshore banks just like the military
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:28.320]  industrial complex is owned by the big offshore banks who can create unlimited
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:33.240]  fiat money they need a trillion bucks they just created then they go oh the
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:38.040]  economy will implode if this implodes shine on your faith and credit of your
[1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:44.160]  government of Iceland or Germany or the US and then we're told that's our debt
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:49.440]  by their operatives on the news and that's a good trick if you can get
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:52.240]  people to accept it and they can only do that because they won't even tell
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:56.520]  people on our media now they did they did it first but the memo went out don't
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:01.280]  talk about Cyprus don't say that's a theft don't talk about money out of bank
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:07.600]  accounts so now it's called Cyprus got its bailout good news for its people
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:13.200]  next up on Fox News I actually heard that on Fox radio and saw that on Fox TV
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:19.400]  tuned over to CNN last week same thing well Cyprus got some good news they got
[1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:23.120]  their bailout that'll keep them going under some people didn't like it there
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:33.720]  was some firebombing you know those troublemakers of course what they could
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:37.280]  just say no like Iceland and find out that 90 plus percent of the debt was not
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:42.440]  theirs and fire and banker debt what did England the British government first
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:45.320]  say when Iceland three years ago said we're not gonna pay back this debt it's
[1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:51.040]  not ours they announced in the news that all Icelanders all 400,000 were
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:55.800]  terrorists and could not board British Airways flights if you're wondering what
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:59.640]  homeland securities for here and the same systems in Europe it's for if you
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:03.080]  try to get your money out of the bank you're a terrorist they're aiming guns
[1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:07.420]  that you out of the teller window literally you can pull up video and
[1:12:07.420 --> 1:12:10.800]  photos you've seen it inside person other areas where they now have brought
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:15.360]  in foreign mercenaries foreign security firms is what they're called to stand
[1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:22.160]  outside and inside with loaded submachine guns so you don't give the
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:26.080]  bank a problem because there are some elitists who are exempt and you know some
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:33.480]  people only get 10% out some 100% taken out of their after-tax money and this
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:36.800]  is what they're going to do here see when you don't have a second amendment
[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:40.440]  let me tell the cowards because there's not just authoritarians that have an
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:50.000]  instinct to disarm the American people yeah there's the BBC Iceland Britain's
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:54.320]  unlikely new enemy and then announces how they were all terrorist of course the
[1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:57.880]  Icelanders called their bluff and said fine don't let us fly on British
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:02.520]  Airways or come to England and then they had to remove that but but no they
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:06.000]  tried to say you're a terrorist and folks there that's why FEMA gets up and
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.280]  says George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are terrorists and anyone that
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:14.600]  supports the Constitution is a terrorist I have that on video in my film
[1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:24.120]  Road to Terrorine with all the government documents it's making the rounds
[1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:28.680]  as George Washington blog linked to it today's we put it up on info wars.com
[1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:34.160]  and people 12 years after I got that footage I got it right before 9-11 out
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:38.000]  of Kansas City a firefighter at a law enforcement they're trying to turn
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:43.880]  firefighters in the cops you know spies now and most the cops were agreeing and
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:47.280]  they just said I have 18 hours of it I got to find that on VHS it's somewhere
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:51.600]  in the warehouse and put the whole thing on the web people said why didn't you do
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:54.280]  it 12 years ago back then was really hard to put stuff on the web there was no
[1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:58.560]  YouTube I put the clip of the bribery on my own servers when I caught bribery at
[1:13:58.560 --> 1:14:05.200]  the Capitol and I got like I forget it was some giant $15,000 bill when you
[1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:09.760]  know a few hundred thousand people watched it and there it is FEMA founding
[1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:20.000]  fathers were terrorists terrorists terrorists so I want to get your take
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.240]  on all this they officially say they've got to restrict our guns to get us in
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:29.760]  line with the UN treaty and the UN treaty says only states can have guns
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:34.800]  private citizens cannot and the media goes oh no it doesn't say that and then
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:38.920]  Forbes went and actually read the whole treaty and said no it's true it it goes
[1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:45.480]  after your guns and they even recommend how to get the guns first license them
[1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:49.600]  then confiscate them like you did in over 160 other countries in the last 50
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:55.000]  years you mean that way you know in Burma they they took the guns from the
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.840]  natives very few of them had them and then the two years after they had a gun
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:03.520]  buyback and took them they went in and killed Fort the British government did
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:11.080]  on record 4,000 plus of the population because they wanted their land they just
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:14.400]  mowed them down and again it's always every day I see the back of the paper
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:18.320]  oh yeah UN forces killed a bunch of people I showed you articles last hour
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:22.000]  BBC you name it bragging about it you're lighting up little kids blowing their
[1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:25.840]  heads off but see they don't make it a big deal when they do that but when 20
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:30.280]  people get killed at Sandy Hook which you can bet your boots was a staged
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:33.640]  operation and by the way there were kids they're not going to pass up an
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:37.960]  opportunity to grease some kids that's what they enjoy their work it's like
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:40.960]  one time they asked Prince Philip you know why do you like gardening and doing
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:45.200]  it yourself it was why enjoy gardening you know you that's part of the thing
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:52.280]  getting your hands dirty and I mean the UN is an army of pedophiles everywhere
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:56.280]  they go they rape and murder children and it always comes out and then it's not
[1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:59.880]  on the news and now they just arrest reporters for violating interpoll and
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:05.360]  global rules of the expose it in fact you know they're going after reporters
[1:16:05.360 --> 1:16:08.600]  that expose White House corruption now they should get a Pulitzer prize how
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:15.520]  about you go to jail you see and why because we've bent over to corruption
[1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:21.760]  we've bent down and licked its boots and and people think that's a virtue now and
[1:16:21.760 --> 1:16:26.920]  the globalists go to public places and they take one look at the soft weak
[1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:31.400]  pathetic people and they say we're gonna take everything they've got and give
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:34.480]  them ridiculous cover stories and they're such cowards they're gonna go along
[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:38.000]  with it and they go well who do we have to worry about historically the police
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  in military we've done the questionnaires we know who's good we know
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:48.800]  who's bad and for them the the bad is the good we know who'll do anything yeah
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:52.480]  but we got to worry about them they'll try to form a coup against us like they
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:56.000]  always will we'll take care of them oh yeah oh that was the last message they're
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:01.400]  not just gonna go after the good police and and and military the number one

[1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:35.160]  right outside your door but I have to tell you could literally make the
[1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:39.360]  difference between life and death for you and your family watch my video at
[1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:44.800]  crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis you'll
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:48.720]  be shocked see the controversial video that thousands of other smart
[1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:52.560]  patriots have already seen in the last three months go watch my video now at
[1:23:52.560 --> 1:24:01.040]  crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down again that's crisis123.com
[1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:15.040]  if we simply get the word out as a culture as a society and really show
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:20.200]  people the two different sides that are there and then tell folks to make a
[1:24:20.200 --> 1:24:24.240]  choice what side they're on will win this thing we have the moral authority
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:29.920]  but if people buy into the hoax we're going to probably lose this thing now
[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:33.120]  those of you that try to enforce it are gonna be the biggest losers but but
[1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:37.000]  still they will get their new world order because wrecking America and other
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.600]  Western countries is part of the globalist plan they're decade and 50 year
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:50.080]  planners that's why every sitcom every cop show every drama every program out
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:56.600]  there demonizes gun owners libertarians conservatives returning veterans every
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:25:05.520]  show the following where you have a psychopathic leader with a cult of
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:10.000]  psychos that try to impress him surrounds himself with police that are
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:15.520]  secretly anti-New World Order and surrounds himself with people that are
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:21.840]  constitutionalist and militias and farmers I've now had a chance to go and
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:25.440]  watch some of the episodes clips of it online and it's the same as the show
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:32.240]  founding fathers where talking to Shane Steiner he saw the episode I haven't
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:35.960]  seen it he described it to me I think was Shane described it to me where the
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:41.760]  veteran joins al-Qaeda overseas and comes back and now he's leading the local
[1:25:41.760 --> 1:25:45.560]  Patriot Tea Party but he's really al-Qaeda people like how are they gonna sell that
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:50.760]  see the real manuals for about four years say the Pentagon expects this is
[1:25:50.760 --> 1:25:54.760]  army war college has been in the mainstream news we first broke it people
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:58.960]  couldn't believe it and then the news picked it up oh it must be real see we're
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:05.600]  bad because we break things that are accurate we're not uplifted or exalted
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:10.920]  because of that and it said yeah the Tea Party the Pentagon predicts will merge
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:14.680]  with al-Qaeda and try to overthrow the US government now what does that really
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:18.640]  mean the globalists are gonna blow stuff up and say al-Qaeda did it with the tea
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:23.040]  party that's about the most Islamic phobic group out there you know I told
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:26.680]  you this guy a few weeks ago overseas running around saying you know former
[1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:31.240]  army or former a Marine guy saying I'm with that with al-Qaeda and I'm over
[1:26:31.240 --> 1:26:35.880]  fighting against the side and they said so you work for the US government too and
[1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:41.320]  he goes yeah well you know we we work both sides and I said they'll probably
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:45.480]  I said they're probably stage his arrest or works they may put him in jail
[1:26:45.480 --> 1:26:50.560]  because he bragged I can fly back and forth I mean what a dumb guy definitely
[1:26:50.560 --> 1:27:00.200]  not an agent yet an operative a asset I mean they've got whole brigades of US
[1:27:00.200 --> 1:27:03.200]  soldiers over there with beards and everything fighting alongside the
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:11.040]  Saudis Brigades some estimates are 30,000 US European troops over there with
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:17.640]  the 50 to 60,000 jihadis out of Saudi Arabia and Qatar that's on record
[1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:27.040]  just like the Navy SEALs all grow beards in Afghanistan and all you fools I told
[1:27:27.040 --> 1:27:32.040]  you they'll probably use some of you and say you're real al-Qaeda on the news to
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:36.120]  you know I said this about a year ago I said they're using forces they're
[1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:39.800]  sheep dipping them and making them join al-Qaeda they think they're infiltrating
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:44.400]  al-Qaeda and you're gonna be the rollout to save veterans in the US are all
[1:27:44.400 --> 1:27:47.600]  secretly al-Qaeda because when I started seeing these internal manuals that
[1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:52.000]  federal people were sending me and stuff you know that said the Tea Party is gonna
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.680]  merge with al-Qaeda I'm like wait that makes no sense no one will buy it and I'm
[1:27:55.680 --> 1:27:58.920]  gonna wait how would they do that all right well I know they're actually
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:02.440]  running al-Qaeda so they've got special forces they'll order special forces to
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:06.920]  go undercover that's what they do spies special forces means military spy
[1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:11.440]  specially trained combat spy is really what it is and no one even describes it
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:15.120]  like that on the news but that's what it is specially trained combat spies high
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:19.080]  IQ well you high enough IQ to know criminals run America and the planet
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:24.680]  now you're being sheep dipped like McVay was sheep dipped into militias to then
[1:28:24.680 --> 1:28:28.360]  blame militias when they set him up for the bombing we know the names of the
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:33.680]  feds that did it with all the eyewitnesses now they're sheep dipping the
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:40.120]  military into al-Qaeda to then say the military is all secretly al-Qaeda and I
[1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:45.160]  said that's how they do it I mean it's the it's the only way they do it and now
[1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:50.720]  to back it up they've got at least it was five six shows on TV that I happen to
[1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:55.640]  have run into or know about no no seven sorry they showed me one other one
[1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:59.240]  forget the name of the show it's where criminals go and become good and help
[1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:01.840]  people fix their houses up but the bad guys on the show are always
[1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:06.840]  constitutionalist and you know they can't be reprieved and godowners who was
[1:29:06.840 --> 1:29:10.600]  telling me about that it was David Knight was telling me about that show no
[1:29:10.600 --> 1:29:13.120]  no was a construction guy was here telling me about that the other day
[1:29:13.120 --> 1:29:16.440]  because he was sitting in there waiting to meet with me while I was shooting the
[1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:21.280]  news and he had to listen I said that sounds crazy he was no no no there's
[1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:23.840]  this show I watched with my wife where they do the same thing so I got to go
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:28.720]  check on that my point is this is the whole plan okay that's so military you
[1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:32.280]  are al-Qaeda just get ready they're gonna put you in a forced labor camp you
[1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:35.600]  don't think the Soviets globalists are gonna work you're gonna work in the

[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:30.920]  police personnel worldwide never take part in role-playing or drills because
[1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:35.040]  99% of the time it won't be an issue don't take part in drills where you play
[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:39.480]  the part of a radical Islamic terrorist or a radical right-wing terrorist
[1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:44.400]  because one day you're gonna drive a real truck of explosives onto a military
[1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:50.760]  base or if they pick a federal building that's got a daycare there's not many of
[1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:53.720]  them there's a good chance you better check in the back of that truck that's
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:59.040]  gonna be real explosive and you're gonna go down in history as the right-winger
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:02.840]  who secretly worked for Al Qaeda and again new listeners are going that makes
[1:34:02.840 --> 1:34:06.920]  no sense I mean if they told people to throw their kids off cliffs to prove
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:10.080]  they didn't like Al Qaeda right-wingers would do it I mean it's a total phobia
[1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:16.680]  they love hating Muslims it's a religion that's why it's so funny it's so sick
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:23.000]  they've got US forces Marines Army special forces ordered to go Al Qaeda
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:28.800]  against Syria and other areas in Africa African all over North Africa and
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:33.200]  they're now setting them up and arresting them as I said they would do
[1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:39.320]  people are like how do you know this because it's shaking bake I I know how
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:45.560]  to cook a pork chop with shake and bake I mean it's like read the directions
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:51.000]  they do this all the time I see the new narrative they're putting out to the
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:55.600]  feds out of the ADL's other Barbara Law Center that represent the foreign banks
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:58.680]  that have captured America to a great extent now they want to shut down the
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:01.960]  free media mop up who their enemies are and who are their enemies
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:06.320]  constitutionalists that want sovereignty and don't want to take over and so what
[1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:09.160]  do they do they've set up Homeland Security for terrorists they're gonna
[1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:14.440]  say veterans and patriots are Al Qaeda how do you do that you stage stuff and
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:18.440]  say patriots who are Al Qaeda do it did it how do you introduce the idea you just
[1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:22.800]  start having news articles four years ago going soon white Al Qaeda whites will
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:27.200]  link up with Al Qaeda no one had ever done it it was nowhere wasn't true then
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:30.440]  you order the military to join Al Qaeda it doesn't matter they're ordered to do
[1:35:30.440 --> 1:35:37.160]  it you put them in jail and now they're going and confiscating the firearms of
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:42.480]  veterans and I'm gonna get to that after I take some calls 800 259 92 31 Rob

[1:35:49.760 --> 1:35:56.400]  ratified the Senate what does what the UN doesn't want you to know and it was a
[1:35:56.400 --> 1:36:00.840]  witness to UN missions with slave trade kidnapping children you name it
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:08.920]  London Telegraph and this is just one of let's be conservative tens of thousands
[1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:14.240]  of admissions of the UN I mean if the UN ever occupies your area they will hunt

[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.800]  American people most importantly the veterans because they are the first
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:17.400]  threat have you heard of a TV show on the history channel called gangland yes I
[1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:23.360]  have okay they're claiming that there's a lot of infiltration of gangsters
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:28.160]  that are being because they're desperate to get bodies to fill the spaces of the
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:32.240]  regular American people that don't want to join the military there yeah and then
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.840]  they have all these big shows about how many units are totally crimp and blood
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:40.280]  and and Mexican mafia and white supremacist just like the prisons are
[1:38:40.280 --> 1:38:44.400]  broken into that the military is and and of course it's still a small percentage
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:48.680]  but yes the total destruction of our military is coming it's gonna be drones
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:54.720]  robots foreign mercs the US military's done the official plan is it's gone I
[1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:59.160]  mean I saw them ten years ago in the Army War College on C-SPAN tell the
[1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:03.680]  generals that you work for the world government the foreign banks so yes
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:07.360]  that they the the generals have known this for over a decade this is official
[1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:12.400]  and this is the beginning of it go ahead so you you you don't think it's
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:19.360]  propaganda there that's that's true fact oh it's what there's massive gangs in
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:24.040]  the military right right that's a fact that's absolute fact okay very good
[1:39:24.040 --> 1:39:28.360]  well this is another thing I want to speak about why don't they put these
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:32.840]  individuals and the TV show with all the cities across the country are
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:37.200]  infested with gangsters why don't they open the FEMA camps and put them in
[1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:42.160]  there well they're not gonna do that and again they sold an MTV gang culture
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:46.400]  then they shipped the drugs in to break down the society to give them a culture
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:50.480]  of death and then now you know all the kids no matter what color they are or
[1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:54.160]  taught the culture of death and so they just passed around a poison drink to
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:59.160]  enchant us you know to to to put us under the spell of corruption to where you
[1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:03.560]  know our young women think somebody that acts like a thug is a man and a man a
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:07.800]  real man who actually works hard and is good and decent so wimp and the women
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:12.440]  wonder why they're so unhappy because again they follow what the TV says you
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:17.800]  do what the TV says and it says you know be married to a crackhead so it must be
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:22.880]  good and again the TV says go join the military so they can inject you with
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:28.040]  soft-killed binary bio weapons and then give you the rest of poison later and
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:32.720]  then I mean look it's over the beginning of the destruction of the US military is
[1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:37.840]  on they in ten years it will be completely robot and of course you know
[1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:40.960]  they want to have the trendies it will be nothing but the globalist kind of
[1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:45.840]  Soviets at the grass roots level who will be piloting and overseeing the
[1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:49.600]  autonomous drones they'll kind of be like the you know the toilet attendant of
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:53.720]  the stigial you know person there at the command center who believe there's two
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:58.120]  but this is all been actuaried all been planned all official Bill Joy wrote about
[1:40:58.120 --> 1:41:01.240]  it 12 years ago told you the official plan and he went to the meeting the
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:04.520]  globalist they're gonna kill everybody he said do you care no one did okay we're
[1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:08.680]  gonna destroy you and the public is begging rolling around begging begging
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:11.640]  to have their children have convulsions and die in front of them after the shots
[1:41:11.640 --> 1:41:16.480]  begging to be put in prison begging to let police boots and so that the system
[1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:20.800]  is gonna destroy everybody because we want to be destroyed how's that sound
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:28.200]  disgusting now if I think that is the true threat to national security is
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:34.800]  the technocratic rise of the robot transhumanist singularity the
[1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:40.200]  singularity is our death they're planning to have Skynet they're planning our
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:46.600]  death they are merging with the machines yeah I'm sorry go ahead you were
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:50.160]  saying that is the and I interrupted you well no that that's what I'm what I'm
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:53.120]  saying I think if you look at everything as a whole that is the
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:59.320]  destruction and that is the the real true threat is them converting everybody
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:03.600]  into this gangster mentality and yeah but only so they can all be divided and
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:07.920]  controlled by the federal UN force we must be totally divided into racial and
[1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:14.360]  religious and and ethnic sub sub districts to then be ruled right out of
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:21.440]  hunger games by floating fortresses yeah and everyone is now ready for that
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:24.720]  because is what they've been taught and the way they're gonna kill us is with
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:29.200]  blimps at a hundred and twenty thousand feet with microwaves on them and they
[1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:32.480]  just love your city and microwave your city by grids everybody wonders while
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:36.800]  they die a year later of cancer and then that's all official Alexander Hague
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:41.600]  wrote about it 20 years ago I saw him bragging about it 167 knows it was I
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:45.520]  saw him 20 years ago he wrote about it 25 years ago I mean it's just it's all
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:49.560]  their plans general Alexander Hague it's all lovely very lovey lovey but I
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:54.520]  appreciate your call truth is strange with the fiction
[1:42:54.520 --> 1:43:01.360]  Reverend X you're on the air go ahead Alex Jones was happening oh I'm just

[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:08.720]  everybody it's pretty fun watching them turn up the ambient background
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:12.720]  radiation here's what people need to get up get get a home through their head
[1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:17.400]  okay after this Fukushima deal okay the radiation is already here if we don't
[1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:21.880]  stand up now that's the biggest problem in the world if we don't stand up to
[1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:25.800]  this other stuff now we're not going to be able to deal with the actual problem
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:28.120]  is that what you actually called in about that's weird that I brought up
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:33.160]  radiation well yeah well it happens that way anybody that's seen my web show
[1:43:33.160 --> 1:43:37.720]  knows about that you just kind of go with what's there okay as far as the
[1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:42.640]  UN treaty goes okay nobody's ever read that document nobody that I've ever
[1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:48.400]  met out I have okay but so many people are willing to just lay down throw away
[1:43:48.400 --> 1:43:53.080]  the Constitution throw away God I love it ready to turn their life over to the
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:56.760]  UN that's right have you ever know have you ever known the UN to help anybody
[1:43:56.760 --> 1:44:02.200]  well I mean all of the actresses and Matt Damon says so and I mean Angelina
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:05.920]  Jolie openly was an admitted Satan worship her who loves death and blood I
[1:44:05.920 --> 1:44:11.440]  mean she said so she's nice well apparently that that must make it you
[1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:18.520]  know the new movie the book at least the the World War Z the UN murders gun
[1:44:18.520 --> 1:44:21.760]  owners worldwide and the and love the zombies because they help bring down
[1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:28.560]  America and they actually say Marxism is the answer in the book yeah that's
[1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:32.760]  gotta be the high point of this okay there is no Marxism everything's fine
[1:44:32.760 --> 1:44:38.240]  yeah you know our last night that there was a couple down in Brazil that got
[1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:43.640]  raked and beaten for several hours did the UN help them absolutely not
[1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:49.480]  everybody thinks that I mean our modern evolution is sir the UN engages in the
[1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:55.160]  most when UN aircraft land they are there to harvest children I mean I mean
[1:44:55.160 --> 1:44:58.760]  it's like a movie where the bad guys come to steal the kids but everyone just
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:02.440]  begs and worships it because they're the UN because every Miss America says they
[1:45:02.440 --> 1:45:06.960]  love kids I mean I mean you go to the mall and every you know beautiful young
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:11.680]  woman is wearing a UNICEF or World Wildlife on shirt I mean it must be
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:18.440]  loving here but here's the thing that our modern evolutionists believe that
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:22.760]  only a bad guy would have a gun right I mean you're a bad guy you like guns I'm
[1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:27.040]  a bad guy I like no no no it's only bad when they don't have the guns and we
[1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:34.160]  have they have the guns we don't that way they can take their time with us yeah
[1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:38.160]  middle there's a guy there's a people think that we shouldn't have guns but
[1:45:38.160 --> 1:45:42.920]  only they're hired mercenaries should have guns yes that's the plan we we've
[1:45:42.920 --> 1:45:48.800]  got to wake them up these guys are never there when you need them okay they are
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:55.320]  never helpful they never do a damn good thing for anybody but for some reason we
[1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:59.440]  have to pay trillions of dollars to have them around okay because when the
[1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:03.360]  rights get taken and God is out of everything and your rights are going to
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:07.920]  be at the discretion of some office in the UN and you know you're gonna know
[1:46:07.920 --> 1:46:14.040]  how to get there thanks for your time Alex yeah I appreciate your call no I
[1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:18.800]  mean that's it I mean the globalists are bad mass murderers they want our guns
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:23.280]  to take our bank accounts and rob us and the state's gonna take over our kids
[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:27.080]  and vaccines are gonna be mandatory and everybody will be dying around you like
[1:46:27.080 --> 1:46:31.400]  they already are and getting sick and they'll just say that's normal and then
[1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:34.960]  they'll take away anyone that criticizes it is mentally ill that's the
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:39.440]  authoritarian model it's here it's happening
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:45.840]  and their people are marching around on power trips getting off on the
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:49.320]  authoritarianism because they're so decadent when you really get decadent
[1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:54.560]  you get into authoritarianism you think it's cool I mean when you look at the
[1:46:54.560 --> 1:47:00.440]  people that run this thing they are just scum but we lay down to them and so
[1:47:00.440 --> 1:47:05.560]  they've taken over America was built on not bowing to government America was
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:10.680]  built on government better be small and respectful and it works for us their
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:14.680]  public servants they're not called public servants they're called authorities
[1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:21.320]  officials we are civilians you know every sack of garbage sack of traitorous
[1:47:21.320 --> 1:47:25.920]  trash like our mayor here in Austin Lee new UN laughing well every
[1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:30.160]  authoritarian you know punk swollen punk they're you know they always call
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:34.800]  themselves the authority and they go you civilians he stands around all the
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:41.160]  police with their guns and we're gonna take your guns we're gonna take everything
[1:47:41.160 --> 1:47:46.200]  you got that's liberal
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:53.880]  let's talk to Todd in Canada Todd you're on the air go ahead sorry today it's a
[1:47:53.880 --> 1:47:57.240]  real honor to talk to you and I've been trying to hold you for a long time and
[1:47:57.240 --> 1:48:01.560]  I'm hoping one day to shake your hand I have an idea for the show I just want
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:05.120]  to blow past you you can take it or you leave it and I can assure you it's
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:09.800]  sincere go ahead my friend my idea for the show is because I've heard quite
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:12.960]  often people say where are the men in this country and I agree where are the
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:15.960]  men in this country I'm calling from Canada I can tell you it's hard to find
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:19.800]  people who are awake see what's going on and I'll tell you right now man I got a
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:23.840]  signed copy of the Constitution and I'm in my bedroom I love the Constitution and
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:27.160]  I love America I love North America I love everybody that's a mental illness
[1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:31.720]  according to the and they're the authorities hey look they've put
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:38.680]  hormones in the water to feminized men and so if you gave those hormones to
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:43.520]  to bulls they would act docile we're under chemical warfare I mean the
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:48.440]  White House science are admits they put stuff in the water eco science he's
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:52.520]  written a couple other books this is all a fact and even now as it comes out
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:55.720]  they drug the water they go yeah we're gonna drug it more now we're gonna put
[1:48:55.720 --> 1:49:01.200]  lithium in to make you behave I mean these people are flaming authoritarian
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:06.960]  monsters and that's where the men went brother I agree with you but I do think
[1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:09.520]  there are still a lot of men in the country and I know they're out there
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:13.000]  listening right now and I want to speak to them for just a moment and my diet my
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:16.720]  idea for the show is for these people to call in just a short segment of your
[1:49:16.720 --> 1:49:20.480]  show when you do have callers to call in and we want to hear from the men in
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:23.840]  this country because I know they're out there I'm calling right now man I'm one
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:30.120]  of them I'm making videos on YouTube I'm speaking to people keep going telling
[1:49:30.120 --> 1:49:32.720]  you like I'm fighting hard man I'm fighting up here I'm fighting with you
[1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:35.880]  guys and you guys down there need to know you got brothers in the trench up
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:40.120]  here in Canada big time we're together and we're I'm here to fight with you man
[1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:43.760]  well I know there are people worldwide not this issue of the magazine but the
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:48.840]  next issue we're gonna put three bumper stickers in it full-size bumper stickers
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:55.040]  that'll be about three hundred and forty thousand bumper stickers that are
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:49:59.320]  gonna go out to be put on legal and awful places in your car give to friends
[1:49:59.320 --> 1:50:04.880]  your book back or whatever that will certainly get the word out but just
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:09.880]  just it's a spirit of resistance and look record low numbers for TV viewers
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:13.800]  record low numbers for cable viewers record low the establishments dying
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:18.440]  that's why they're trying to totally take over right now not from a position of
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:22.840]  strength but from weakness but they're doing a psychological tactic now of
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:25.680]  hiding in plain view that's why they're like of course we're gonna kill old
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.120]  people and babies they're after they're born it's liberal of course the UN
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:32.720]  murders everyone the new you know we have to it's for the earth of course the

[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:17.520]  Colonel Jackson down to mighty missus you notice they never made a movie about
[1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:21.000]  Andrew Jackson's and they caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:27.960]  it's like reading Conan the barbarian novels or something you can love Andrew
[1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:32.680]  Jackson or hating but I mean he grew up as tough as they come didn't even learn
[1:54:32.680 --> 1:54:35.400]  how to read and write till he was about 16 because the war came when he was like
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:41.000]  I don't nine years old time he was about 12 he was running courier notes and
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.680]  shooting redcoats his mother and brother his dad died his little kid working the
[1:54:44.680 --> 1:54:50.120]  land his mother and brother died in a British concentration camp they invented
[1:54:50.120 --> 1:54:54.480]  it they invented it Scotland and Ireland and of course they didn't call it a
[1:54:54.480 --> 1:54:58.960]  concentration camp that was the idea to put natives and reservations that
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:02.840]  actually came from Ireland and Scotland locking everybody up oh we didn't
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:06.640]  execute them we just let them starve to death out in the open weather they let
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:11.480]  them freeze to death and of course it was he ended up using those same policies
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:15.560]  against Native Americans himself I guess the abuser the abuse becomes the
[1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:20.480]  abuser but I mean you read the whole life of Andrew Jackson and then Davey
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:25.480]  Crockett Davey Crockett was trying to basically imitate Andrew Jackson he was
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:31.520]  the big icon of all the battles and wars and stabbings and shootings and you know
[1:55:31.520 --> 1:55:36.560]  shot three times stab bleeding for a week straight refusing to die I mean just
[1:55:36.560 --> 1:55:44.160]  tough as nails Andrew Jackson I read those British descriptions of the battle
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:49.920]  New Orleans where they describe him up on the parapet while they're firing all
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:53.600]  their cannons at him for hours because they were losing until he arrived he
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:56.960]  just stood there like a black cloak they could see his eyes from hundreds of
[1:55:56.960 --> 1:56:00.840]  yards away they like they describe like a grim reaper just radiating hatred at
[1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:06.000]  them I mean that stuff's incredible folks when you've read like the ships logs and
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:09.560]  all the stuff of those wars and like they just couldn't shoot him was just like
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:17.400]  George Washington because by then it didn't even have any teeth hardly and
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:20.200]  they're like all that gray hair up there hasn't that was before he was even
[1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:25.480]  president at the time it was president he couldn't even talk he had no teeth
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:35.760]  oh man it's so bizarre and then look what we've become today what have I
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:41.760]  become my sweetest friend everyone I know goes away in the end but you could

[2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:36.600]  plutocracies monarchies and the unyielding rule is they wage war against
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:41.680]  common sense reality and decency especially the more aged and decadent
[2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:47.960]  the empires get and they always end up trying to turn the population into
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:52.440]  cattle they always want to dumb them down to make them more easily managed and
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:59.000]  they always have their own undoing as they get rid of checks and balances as
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:02.040]  they get rid of the checks and balances they get rid of any protection they hand
[2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:06.480]  but now they're just globalists they're offshore in the law they're exempt and
[2:01:06.480 --> 2:01:11.280]  then we're tied down with all these fraudulent laws so the answer is start
[2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:14.360]  ignoring it all I mean it I mean it really those of us that are upright
[2:01:14.360 --> 2:01:18.080]  decent and good we just got to figure out ways to resist the system not go

[2:01:31.060 --> 2:01:34.200]  caller wants to know about a list of the responsible Dean that's a good idea
[2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:37.920]  people argue about who should be responsible but Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:43.960]  Chase the UN the club of Rome Bilderberg groups Ames the Rockefellers the Roth
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:50.560]  Childs Peter Singer I mean it George Soros I mean these are the authors of
[2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:55.960]  Ted Turner Bill and Melinda Gates I mean they're the ones pushing the whole
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:01.720]  agenda who do you think should be on that list Dean in California or on the
[2:02:01.720 --> 2:02:07.280]  air oh Alex thank you so much I'm a first-time caller I've only been listening
[2:02:07.280 --> 2:02:11.080]  to you for about a year and a half although I've probably been of your
[2:02:11.080 --> 2:02:15.320]  mindset and belief system for a lot longer than that and unfortunately I
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:20.760]  live in the ground zero of nutcases here in California well you and people that
[2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:24.280]  are buying in that they're winners because they drank the Kool-Aid that
[2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:28.800]  these are cult members they're very sad actually that's why they'll laugh at you
[2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:31.720]  and say I don't believe the reality you're saying they talked to you like a
[2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:35.840]  cult member and go I'm powerful I'm part of the Jim Jones cult I'm part of the
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:39.600]  New World Order cult and it's like no listen I mean I tried to lovingly talk
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:42.640]  to this collectivist the other day who said basically we're taking over he
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:46.920]  just laughed and said you can't reach me he was so wrapped up in his blanket of
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:51.880]  idiocy I was like okay that's why I was sad I we shouldn't feel bad when they
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:55.320]  laugh at us these are these are gibbering idiots I'm sorry go ahead make
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:03:01.240]  your point well yeah my my question was if there was such a list or if you had
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:06.960]  ever had any requests for you know here's the list of the 101,000 people that
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:12.360]  actually are the ones responsible here's Dr. Rothkopf head of the Kissinger
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:16.280]  Group wrote a book called superclass that I did read and it's pretty accurate
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:20.200]  he's telling you how lucky we are to have the superclass 6,000 mega gophers
[2:03:20.200 --> 2:03:24.400]  less than 20 ruling families I think people should there there are corporate
[2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:28.780]  governance maps out there that show pretty good accurate things this is a
[2:03:28.780 --> 2:03:33.680]  unified crime wave we're dealing with of Eugenicist I mean you like the Koch
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:37.200]  Brothers they're on the Cold Springs Harbor Eugenics board I mean there's
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:39.480]  just all even though they're enemies with the other globalists it's just all
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:43.760]  the same people they're God we're not we're animals so they can run over us I
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:49.440]  mean it's that attitude when it all blows back on them so I think everybody
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:53.040]  should make their own list everybody should talk about the villains everybody
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:57.900]  it's important it's important they be knee-deep in the list our founders did
[2:03:57.900 --> 2:04:03.560]  that for decades before 1776 they circulated a list of the tyrants yeah my
[2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:09.360]  thought was that it would be effective if someone as widely recognized as you
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:13.480]  had that kind of a list at least so that they were aware that we are watching
[2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:18.000]  and we know specifically who they are not just some faceless oh they know
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:21.760]  they're being watched I mean that's why they live on country roads with
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:25.800]  homeland security cameras scanning everybody's driver's license everybody's
[2:04:25.800 --> 2:04:30.200]  plates and that's why they you know live behind armored doors and have body
[2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:33.640]  guards I mean they know they've they've ripped off countries they've ordered
[2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:40.240]  hits they've this is mafia sir and I hopefully don't ever have to take up
[2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:44.000]  arms although my wife and I are more than prepared to do that and again
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:48.160]  hopefully that doesn't come to that well they're trying to script if there's a
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:52.640]  civil war graph of the police the police are just either brainwashed or they're
[2:04:52.640 --> 2:04:56.680]  not you know they're already on our side if they start a war folks the

[2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:05.080]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even
[2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:08.640]  if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led
[2:07:08.640 --> 2:07:13.160]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in
[2:07:13.160 --> 2:07:16.120]  the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[2:07:16.120 --> 2:07:21.280]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that

[2:08:37.080 --> 2:08:44.960]  above is to wage war on corruption to crash the lies and disinformation to
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:53.040]  satellite brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere a great battle
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:58.920]  is now raging against any form of liberty freedom or healthiness the
[2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:02.960]  globalists wish to sicken us with their poison of degradation so we'll roll over
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:09.320]  having all of our basic freedoms scrapped and burned on the ash heap of
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:16.040]  history again ladies and gentlemen it is the second day the second day of
[2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:20.200]  April 2013 I have a lot of news I'm gonna be mentioning this hour on the
[2:09:20.200 --> 2:09:25.960]  economic front but I wanted to get and next time I want to get him in studio
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:29.240]  because I want to give him on the nightly news as well to do an entire two-hour
[2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:33.080]  presentation to kind of do his presentation he teaches in Constitution
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:38.560]  class for our TV viewers because I'm setting up a lecture in the whole area
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:42.520]  we're gonna have special you know educational forums put on to really
[2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:48.160]  understand liberty with former Macadoshes County Sheriff's Deputy Eddie Craig
[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:52.720]  and Eddie lives here in Austin now as a talk show host and I was listening a few
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:56.160]  weeks ago on local radio he was talking about police are going to decide which
[2:09:56.160 --> 2:09:59.960]  side of the line they're on as the corruption gets more and more out in the
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:04.640]  open and how every time the police pull you over they're breaking laws and they
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:10.480]  can rationalize that but but now we've gotten to the point of three weeks ago
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:15.360]  I'm on a very rare vacation at the Texas Coast and I get a call from Max
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:19.880]  Cabrera running my street team and he says the police are here they're giving
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:24.440]  us tickets for handing out magazines and they say the company car was actually
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:31.040]  Max's car cannot have an info wars com sticker on it parked in a meter and I
[2:10:31.040 --> 2:10:35.040]  said I believe you but I don't believe you I mean even I know we're entering but
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:41.480]  I couldn't believe it but I should have known you see this all over the country so
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:45.800]  later they got the head code enforcer who was commanding the cops they wouldn't
[2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:49.840]  talk they said talk to this guy he's here I get on the phone the guy tells me
[2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:54.760]  as a listener he apologizes it's like I'm I'm sorry I'm doing this to you I mean
[2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:58.760]  in Nazi Germany do they apologize to folks down on the ditch but he goes yeah
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:02.040]  I'm told I'm gonna have to give the ticket and then if you don't stop after
[2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:07.520]  that's a rest you can't have that car parked there and we say it violates
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:10.400]  advertising in the right away that's how it's interpreted by my bosses I don't
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:15.000]  agree with it and your people can't hand out magazines he said I know this street
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:19.200]  team they're down here I've never heard of this but this is the order and I said
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:23.760]  alright I'm gonna sue you and you tell the cops I'm gonna sue them personally so
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:27.120]  the cops went oh we don't want to be sued they went to their superiors and they
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:30.160]  said well we're not gonna enforce the ordinance which is which was being
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:34.160]  wrongly applied but the point is if I would have gone along with it people
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:37.800]  say oh go along with it I had South by Southwest employees walking by when I
[2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:41.200]  finally got down there the next day protesting going get a life buddy quit
[2:11:41.200 --> 2:11:44.920]  causing trouble Alex and coming up to the glass windows the convention center
[2:11:44.920 --> 2:11:48.880]  and flipping me off and laughing oh look there's the coke that thinks we ought
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:52.960]  to be able to head out magazines on street corners what a piece of trash
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:57.880]  they would all get together because that's how they think and stand at the
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:02.320]  windows we have us on video and point and go and I could see their badges they
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:09.560]  were management like I'm three years old and other kids laughing at me gets to me
[2:12:09.560 --> 2:12:12.560]  it actually did get to me but not in a way you thought I thought I looked at you
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:16.480]  went no wonder the enemies overrunning us look at those weak pathetic peer
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:21.600]  pressure driven blobs my god what would our forebearers that were as hard as
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:25.880]  nails you know they drug those guns from Tygan Tycander roga like a hundred
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:30.320]  miles I forget and that's why their shoes fell apart old-fashioned shoes
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:36.720]  were leather bottoms and there was a trail of blood written by a British
[2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:40.280]  newspaper reporter who saw it and went back and wrote about it and it actually
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:42.880]  freaked out the red coats obviously because you know what was when you
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:47.080]  march in the snow for a hundred miles dragging giant cannons pure liberty
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:50.920]  driven we people some people lost their toes because some people died how far
[2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:54.400]  do they pull is it 30 miles a hundred I forget Tycander roga through mountain
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:59.360]  passes you tried to walk through gullies and passes pulling giant guns that no
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:04.600]  one said could even be gotten down from the mountain capturing those guns now
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:08.920]  that compared to fat little blobs and I mean spiritually fat but they were fat
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:13.960]  pointing and they would walk up and go haha I knew a fake laugh like oh whoa
[2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:17.640]  like the collectivist that came up to me when I was at a resort for Easter to
[2:13:17.640 --> 2:13:22.200]  family reunion this weekend and I was in the hot tub and I'm talking about yeah
[2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:26.200]  the tyranny and their listeners and we'll they take our bank accounts here and
[2:13:26.200 --> 2:13:29.360]  oh my god how bad will it get and the Republican leaderships control there's
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:32.240]  a guy sitting there for 20 minutes he gets up and goes you're all gonna fail
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:35.920]  we're taking over nothing can stop us he heard us talking about authoritarianism
[2:13:35.920 --> 2:13:40.040]  and how dangerous it was and he wanted to get up and celebrate and point his
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:44.360]  finger and go you're right we're taking over and I go who are you I'm a
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:49.360]  government professor scientist in viruses and he smiled and I went oh my
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:54.920]  god you're a population reductionist eugenicist and I said you know I what
[2:13:54.920 --> 2:13:58.320]  you got taken down the basement of the of the facility when you were you know
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:02.040]  you know getting good grades in college and brought into it and he was like who
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:07.160]  who what where did you that got thrown out though by the time I got older I
[2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:11.520]  hit him one time he was like oh wait wait you know about the club I mean I'm
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:16.320]  like of course I know who you are this is folks they're gonna kill hundreds of
[2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:21.000]  millions of us they got reeducation camps official FEMA documents this is
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:26.520]  real history happening of course I know the enemy I make it my business to know
[2:14:26.520 --> 2:14:31.680]  the enemy and they the globalist think Americans are people that if they put
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:35.840]  out sitcoms and dramas where patriots are all terrorists will act but people
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:39.120]  will actually watch that and then believe when they hear my show that we're
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:43.560]  really terrorists folks the terrorists have taken over they run al-qaeda our
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:48.560]  government runs al-qaeda publicly it's foreign banker run Eddie Craig you hear
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:52.960]  my rant here we got calls coming up again it got lost in translation about a
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:56.240]  month ago I said let's get Eddie Craig in here to do his whole traffic course
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:14:59.920]  and then I also want to get you on about something else a few weeks ago but
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:03.280]  well I want to have you in next week maybe for an hour in studio and then two
[2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:07.520]  hour presentation because I'd like to put that out to everybody and you could
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:11.720]  call it you can follow Texas law but it's similar most as you know but I just
[2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:15.840]  wanted to get into what what would you do because you're very successful in
[2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:19.240]  court you really know what you're talking about if this isn't Patriot
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:23.360]  mythology you follow this is the real deal it's I want to expand your knowledge
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:28.680]  out to a larger base out there but Eddie what would you have done I mean what
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:32.880]  should I do that they gave us tickets saying that there is no free speech in
[2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:37.680]  Austin Texas and and and I guess should I maybe I should be laughed at maybe I'm
[2:15:37.680 --> 2:15:41.240]  the bad man maybe the first amendment's bad too I mean you know the
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:44.560]  authoritarian left let's get rid of everything let's get rid of the second
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:48.840]  amendment the first minute private property I mean maybe maybe I should cry
[2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:52.040]  that they laughed at me Eddie would you cry if they laughed at you would that
[2:15:52.040 --> 2:15:57.680]  shake you up pretty bad I'd probably cry at the level of stupidity because
[2:15:57.680 --> 2:16:03.640]  these are mental patients what do you call that though where they
[2:16:03.640 --> 2:16:07.560]  laugh at you because they think it gets to you I mean these are really pathetic
[2:16:07.560 --> 2:16:15.600]  jellyfish well you can't help but just kind of smile to yourself about the
[2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:19.600]  ignorance of the people that we have running things I mean that's just there's
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:23.960]  no other way to put it they're either ignorant because they haven't been taught
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:31.840]  or they're willfully ignorant because they refuse to be taught what do you
[2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:36.000]  call this type of mind control that we're seeing the society go under am I
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:41.480]  wrong that the tyranny is radically accelerating no you're not wrong every
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:47.040]  time they create something new it has to be something that is based upon more
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:53.080]  control you see it in everything they do there is no basis in any law for what
[2:16:53.080 --> 2:17:00.600]  TSA does but TSA does it on the premise that the American public has been
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:06.000]  converted to enough of a domesticated animal that they will simply do what
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.360]  their master commands for fear of punishment even though there's no
[2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:13.960]  authority behind the master's command the legislators are doing it the city
[2:17:13.960 --> 2:17:18.680]  councils are doing it the county commissioners are doing it as long as
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:24.000]  we allow them to continue to believe what they're doing has an authority they
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:30.680]  will continue to exercise it as if it does well look at how they're saying you
[2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:34.640]  will buy insurance and the price doubles in health care the power to tax power
[2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:38.480]  to destroy now they're saying federally and at state level they're gonna make
[2:17:38.480 --> 2:17:43.200]  you get insurance to have guns or ammo where you waive your rights when you sign
[2:17:43.200 --> 2:17:47.920]  the agreement I mean this is slavery if they can make you do all this and pay
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:55.480]  them for the right to self-defense it is it's definitely the end game well
[2:17:55.480 --> 2:18:00.800]  you're correct it is I mean the more they criminalize what we do the more it's
[2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:06.880]  gonna come down to where there is nothing we can do and American people I'm
[2:18:06.880 --> 2:18:15.200]  sorry folks but our founding fathers are are laughing at us this is exactly what
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:20.080]  they went to war to fight against this is exactly why the rebellion occurred
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:25.200]  they want Britain wanted to disarm the colonists they wanted to tax the
[2:18:25.200 --> 2:18:29.080]  colonists without them having any sense so in their government they wanted the
[2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:33.560]  military to control the people on the king's behalf it was going to be
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:39.960]  completing total dictatorship not a monarchy a dictatorship because the king
[2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:44.880]  would not have been here personally it would have been his military people that
[2:18:44.880 --> 2:18:48.800]  would have been running everything it would have been a complete and total
[2:18:48.800 --> 2:18:54.560]  dictatorship and we're about three steps from falling completely over the
[2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:57.760]  edge of that precipice right now yeah people keep saying it's coming we're
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:03.560]  already deep into it oh yes we're very close to it all you have to do is look
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:09.120]  around and see every interaction that we have a public servant no longer do we
[2:19:09.120 --> 2:19:14.800]  get yes sir no sir I'm sorry about that sir I'll see what we can do to help
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:18.400]  you sir it's like well that's the way we do it and if you don't like it too bad
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:24.080]  this is how we run things this is how we do things that's the mindset of every
[2:19:24.080 --> 2:19:28.360]  public servant you come across oh I know I haven't come to be now in public and
[2:19:28.360 --> 2:19:32.400]  dress me down and they go look you're a slave bud and they laugh at me I mean the
[2:19:32.400 --> 2:19:38.000]  word has gone out they rule well that that's a fact and one of the things that
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.680]  I started teaching in my class is I have written up what I call a
[2:19:41.680 --> 2:19:47.120]  transportation script it's it's a set of instructions that I've given for
[2:19:47.120 --> 2:19:51.280]  people that get pulled over for traffic stops and things these are the things
[2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:55.880]  you say and these are the things you do and you do not deviate from this
[2:19:55.880 --> 2:20:02.200]  deviation will lead you down a path you stand there want to go devastating
[2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:05.800]  events like earthquakes tornadoes floods hurricanes or the threat of

[2:24:13.320 --> 2:24:33.400]  All right, Eddie Craig's our guest, Alex Jones here, and Eddie, I want to get you back on
[2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:36.920]  about how they're breaking the laws every time, you know, the way they pull you over,
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:37.920]  what they do.
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:41.280]  I'm going to fight it in court, actually, and they still haven't sent me in with the
[2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:47.400]  court date, the state police pulled me over going to work, and, you know, it's the standard
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:48.400]  deal now.
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:52.360]  Are you drinking, you know, and it's not in the morning.
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:53.360]  Where are you going?
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:58.080]  It's like, come on, man, give me your fake ticket, but, but it's, again, now the state
[2:24:58.080 --> 2:25:02.280]  police will, every time somebody's shooting a gun anywhere in the country, they now swat
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:06.760]  team the house and people's ranches, you'd have 10,000 acres, they're coming, and they're
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:09.280]  just acting like we're criminals.
[2:25:09.280 --> 2:25:13.280]  And a lot of police have actually woken up, but still they follow unlawful orders, but
[2:25:13.280 --> 2:25:17.240]  still others get downright rude with you.
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:19.560]  And of course it depends on the department.
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:20.800]  How has this been done?
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:22.880]  Why has this been done, Eddie Craig?
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:29.440]  Well, the thing that most people do not know or understand about a traffic stop is that
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:35.920]  they, the officer is intentionally trained to always attempt to escalate the stop to
[2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:39.960]  either a DUI or a drug enforcement bust.
[2:25:39.960 --> 2:25:42.440]  That is mandatory in their training.
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:43.840]  This is what you will do.
[2:25:43.840 --> 2:25:47.440]  That's why you get those questions, are there any drugs in the car?
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:48.560]  Have you been drinking?
[2:25:48.560 --> 2:25:49.560]  How many?
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:50.560]  Where have you been?
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:51.560]  Where are you going?
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:56.560]  This is all to give the officer a rabbit trail to follow where he may discover additional
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:26:00.400]  things he can use to cause that escalation to occur.
[2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:05.720]  So the whole purpose of what I put in that transportation script is to not allow the
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:10.240]  officer to control that flow of information from you.
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:17.040]  You have to be willing to actively engage him in responses in order for him to get that
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:18.040]  information.
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:20.680]  Stop doing that.
[2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:27.880]  You cannot be compelled to answer his questions or give him anything, especially if he can
[2:26:27.880 --> 2:26:32.840]  use it against you in court or use it to attempt to incriminate you.
[2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:38.520]  And I'm telling you, everything you give them will be used for those purposes.
[2:26:38.520 --> 2:26:41.800]  So stop allowing them to have it.
[2:26:41.800 --> 2:26:44.040]  Stop engaging them.
[2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:45.520]  Most people don't understand.
[2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:46.520]  That is a mistake.
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:49.100]  Well, let me stop you right there.
[2:26:49.100 --> 2:26:53.080]  We went to particular hospital because we knew the doctor and she's a nice lady, a patriot.
[2:26:53.080 --> 2:26:58.840]  But still, they have computer terminals and I've had three children in the same hospital
[2:26:58.840 --> 2:27:03.560]  and they say, oh, well, honey, will you take this down to the first floor for me, this
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:04.560]  chart?
[2:27:04.560 --> 2:27:08.440]  And when I come back, she goes, that head nurse was asking, do we have money?
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:10.320]  Do I beat you?
[2:27:10.320 --> 2:27:11.320]  Am I depressed?
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:14.280]  And I went, oh my gosh, they were putting it in the health department registry.
[2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:16.360]  This is like 11 years ago, folks.
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:17.600]  I've learned a lot.
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:23.840]  So by the second time I knew and told her, no thanks, you can ask us both those questions,
[2:27:23.840 --> 2:27:26.640]  but she's there hooked into the government.
[2:27:26.640 --> 2:27:31.120]  She is now an agent of the government, not reading you Miranda rights to try to get your
[2:27:31.120 --> 2:27:32.120]  kids.
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:36.760]  And again, no one, the TV won't tell you this and none of it will tell you.
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:37.760]  These are criminals.
[2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:41.480]  They'll take your kids for not taking shots, though there's no law.
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:43.520]  And it's all part of a criminal swarm.
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:45.160]  So it's not just the cops.
[2:27:45.160 --> 2:27:49.520]  They've turned everybody that comes in your house into spies.
[2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:53.480]  They've turned workers into spies and that's why you'll see it when they're on power trips
[2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:54.480]  looking around your house.
[2:27:54.480 --> 2:27:56.680]  And I'm just like, look, there's nothing illegal here.
[2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:58.180]  And they'll go, what's there?
[2:27:58.180 --> 2:28:00.680]  What's going to look just go do the electrical.
[2:28:00.680 --> 2:28:02.560]  I'm coming to my house one time.
[2:28:02.560 --> 2:28:03.560]  Just okay.
[2:28:03.560 --> 2:28:06.600]  Just I know you're feeling powerful, your government spy and you get percentages of
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:07.600]  it and stuff.
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:08.880]  Well, I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:11.800]  I go, I know you like people creeping around your house.
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:17.640]  You come creeping around my house and the next thing you're going to have is a chalk
[2:28:17.640 --> 2:28:18.640]  outline.
[2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:23.720]  What I'm saying is when you invite workers into your house, unless you know them now,
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:25.920]  everybody's a spy and they're on these power trips.
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:29.320]  Well, I mean, did you know about when you go to have a baby, they're spying on you and
[2:28:29.320 --> 2:28:30.320]  filling out reports?
[2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:31.320]  Oh yeah.
[2:28:31.320 --> 2:28:33.680]  Well, they've actually been doing that for decades.
[2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:38.280]  I mean, they actually have you fill out tons of paperwork and they have for many, many years.
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:41.440]  They push it at you and tell you it's required, but it's not.
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:45.680]  That's why most babies have a social security number issued at birth.
[2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:47.400]  And I didn't get mine until I was 16.
[2:28:47.400 --> 2:28:49.960]  Yeah, it's hard to go ahead.
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:54.160]  The hospital personnel push all that paperwork at you and tell you it's all mandatory required
[2:28:54.160 --> 2:28:55.160]  by the hospital.
[2:28:55.160 --> 2:28:56.160]  When in fact, it's not.
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:29:00.800]  Now, as far as what you're saying on what they're doing in the hospitals, it's not just
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:01.800]  for your children.
[2:29:01.800 --> 2:29:05.720]  It's also to get your guns if and when the state wishes to do so.
[2:29:05.720 --> 2:29:10.120]  They use that information to have you declared non-composimentous.
[2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:15.160]  They will appoint a state guardian, especially if you're someone that has property or something
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:17.040]  the state would like to get its hands on.
[2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:18.040]  Yeah.
[2:29:18.040 --> 2:29:19.240]  They make you a ward of the state.
[2:29:19.240 --> 2:29:23.440]  They now control everything you own, whether you have heirs or not, is irrelevant.
[2:29:23.440 --> 2:29:24.440]  They're mafia.
[2:29:24.440 --> 2:29:25.440]  Period.
[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:26.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:29:26.440 --> 2:29:27.440]  They speak for you.
[2:29:27.440 --> 2:29:31.440]  Oh, my dad is a physician and he says people that he's known for years, especially rich
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:35.920]  people, are having this happen to him with their other doctors and other, and I mean,
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:36.920]  it's bad.
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:43.800]  It's a criminal run organization with mafia, government and foreign banks raping 24-7 every
[2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:44.800]  way they can.
[2:29:44.800 --> 2:29:48.920]  We'll talk about how to protect yourselves, but remember, everyone in the system is now
[2:29:48.920 --> 2:29:50.520]  a stasi spy.
[2:29:50.520 --> 2:29:51.800]  We're on the march.
[2:29:51.800 --> 2:29:54.240]  The empire's on the run.

[2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:41.760]  We're going to go back to our guests and take a few phone calls.

[2:33:57.080 --> 2:33:59.080]  I've sent my crew down there before to cover it.
[2:33:59.080 --> 2:34:00.520]  He does it at Brave New Books.
[2:34:00.520 --> 2:34:05.360]  We're going to have Eddie Craig here with us next week in studio for the third hour

[2:34:14.760 --> 2:34:16.680]  We've got the servers to do it now.
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:17.680]  Used to I did something like that.
[2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:18.680]  It would cause problems.
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:19.680]  We've got a lot.
[2:34:19.680 --> 2:34:20.680]  We've got 10 years now.
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:21.680]  Or is it more?
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:22.680]  Is it 11 years?
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:26.160]  Now, April is our anniversary of, I think it's 11 now, isn't it?
[2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:28.480]  I keep saying 10 for like a year.
[2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:36.120]  For prisonplanet.tv and we've now got all these great reporters, researchers just doing
[2:34:36.120 --> 2:34:38.560]  such a fabulous job.

[2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:28.200]  I see somebody with a big mansion doesn't excite me.
[2:35:28.200 --> 2:35:30.840]  I see somebody defeating tyrants.
[2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:31.840]  I get butterflies.
[2:35:31.840 --> 2:35:35.480]  I get tears in my eyes and I want to meet them.

[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:06.680]  It lapses and I have two months to judge it.

[2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:13.320]  Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant is the prisonplanet.tv operation.
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:14.480]  And I'm just testing things.
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:16.320]  Hey, let's see what 300,000.
[2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:19.200]  I just gave away 150,000 free bumper stickers.
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:20.200]  Shipping included.
[2:36:20.200 --> 2:36:24.400]  I said, okay, let's see what 300 plus thousand does in the next issue with the magazine three
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:27.800]  free ones.
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:31.640]  I mean, we're just here waging war, ladies and gentlemen, we're on tyranny.
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:34.640]  I mean, we're just absolutely committed.
[2:36:34.640 --> 2:36:38.000]  And that's why when people call them say, oh, thank you, you're such a hero.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:41.760]  I'm like, listen, don't call me a hero and I appreciate you.
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:45.240]  You could wild horses couldn't drag me away from this.
[2:36:45.240 --> 2:36:50.920]  I mean, I know that they know the vaccines are designed to brain damage children and
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:55.240]  when you get overcooked, you get completely autistic, you know, when it when it kills
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:36:58.440]  too much of the cerebral cortex, it's a lobotomy.
[2:36:58.440 --> 2:37:04.360]  I've got all the documents written by these people, Edward Bernays, who's the other big
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:12.040]  Nobel Prize winner, Bertrand Russell, all of them, the current White House science
[2:37:12.040 --> 2:37:13.440]  are John P. Holdren.
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:20.680]  I take that personal that they if they can't abort your kid, they want to brain damage
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:21.680]  him.
[2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:22.680]  And now autism is one in 50 something.
[2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:24.760]  The new Canadian government numbers just came out.
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:31.520]  You know, I talked to the lead singer of anthrax because I was out at dinner with Dave Mustaine
[2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:36.400]  and some other folks in the Steiners Steakhouse and we're talking about vaccines and the
[2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:42.360]  guy was a lead singer from another band was there and he was saying that, you know, he
[2:37:42.360 --> 2:37:44.160]  was talking about vaccines how deadly they are.
[2:37:44.160 --> 2:37:45.960]  He didn't know who I was.
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:49.920]  And then he was saying, and then Dave was like, well, you know, the lead singer, the
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:54.680]  former lead singer, you know, the founding lead singer of anthrax, he's also a famous
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:55.680]  watchmaker.
[2:37:55.680 --> 2:37:59.400]  He was saying, you know, his kids have been damaged by this and it's a famous case because
[2:37:59.400 --> 2:38:05.400]  they were two and running around in TV ads and stuff and like becoming famous on their
[2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:06.400]  own right.
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:07.400]  I guess it's twins.
[2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:08.400]  There's two of them.
[2:38:08.400 --> 2:38:09.400]  I'm going from memory here.
[2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:10.400]  I'm getting them on sometime this week or next week.
[2:38:10.400 --> 2:38:14.680]  And they took the shots and had the, you know, you know, had the headache went to sleep for
[2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:19.440]  two days and then whenever back, they do things like that and then they just ignore it all.
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:22.800]  So of course they're going to make nurses now take all these shots when there's no law.
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:25.520]  Of course they lie to you and say, it's the law.
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:26.760]  You can't have your kid.
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:32.080]  They told one of my crew members this until they found out he worked here.
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:34.560]  And this was a preemie that was barely alive.
[2:38:34.560 --> 2:38:35.560]  Two pounds.
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:39.960]  They were trying to shoot up and that was the bioethics board.
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:42.000]  They would have just capped that kid right there.
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:44.440]  I mean, everyone knows you don't give a preemie shots.
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:46.280]  Everyone knows you don't give pregnant women shots.
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:48.800]  They're trying to cap the fetus.
[2:38:48.800 --> 2:38:52.280]  And again, do not call and say I'm a hero.
[2:38:52.280 --> 2:38:53.280]  They're murder.
[2:38:53.280 --> 2:38:54.760]  I should be doing more.
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:55.960]  I should be more inventive.
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:38:58.800]  I pray to God I'm a sack of garbage.
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:00.880]  I'm a dirty rags here folks.
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:02.040]  That's how I feel.
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:04.400]  I'm not doing one one hundredth of what I should.
[2:39:04.400 --> 2:39:08.760]  I pray to God, please give me lead, lead me, guide me and direct me to fight these people
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:10.200]  as best I can.
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:14.800]  Please help me not be a wicked devil.
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:16.200]  And God says, well, that's why I chose you.
[2:39:16.200 --> 2:39:20.200]  I know you're a wicked devil, but you know, you're my wicked devil and your heart is good.
[2:39:20.200 --> 2:39:21.200]  I see these people.
[2:39:21.200 --> 2:39:22.200]  I know how they think.
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:23.200]  I know who they are.
[2:39:23.200 --> 2:39:24.920]  And I just want to get my hands around their neck.
[2:39:24.920 --> 2:39:25.920]  I'll be honest with you.
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:29.320]  Eddie, I'm ranting here, but you know, seeing all this tyranny, getting into how everything's
[2:39:29.320 --> 2:39:32.120]  been turned into a spy grid.
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:35.560]  What I do when somebody's spy gritting me, renting a car, getting a hotel, having a
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:39.000]  kid, I go, look, I know this is being put in a government database.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  Read me my rights.
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  They go, ooh.
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:42.000]  Ooh, you're bad.
[2:39:42.000 --> 2:39:43.600]  I go, no, you're bad doing this.
[2:39:43.600 --> 2:39:44.600]  What about this hospital?
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:47.320]  What about how you keep blood samples of every baby born?
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:50.040]  Oh, I'm not supposed to know that.
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:51.560]  You're part of a criminal conspiracy.
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:54.560]  Now I suggest you go get your boss and find out who I am.
[2:39:54.560 --> 2:39:57.000]  And I suggest you stop preying on innocent families.
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:58.560]  I bet you try to take kids.
[2:39:58.560 --> 2:39:59.560]  People don't take shots.
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:01.960]  They were saying they would take his kid.
[2:40:01.960 --> 2:40:04.920]  One of my crew members, I haven't said his name yet on air.
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:07.280]  The baby months later, still not out of the hospital.
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:11.640]  They would take a kid with its heart valves going back and forth, barely hanging on by
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:12.640]  the grace of God.
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:13.640]  She's better.
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:14.640]  She's a dad.
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:17.120]  We're going to take your kid if we can't go in there and give it shots.
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:19.720]  I mean, that's what America is, okay?
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:22.120]  It's demons seeing how far they can push.
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:27.160]  Eddie, I'm ranting, but go ahead, Eddie Craig, talk show host, Austinite, former sheriff's
[2:40:27.160 --> 2:40:29.360]  deputy who got out of it and blew the whistle on corruption.
[2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:33.240]  I mean, what do you call this wall of evil where they're just seeing what they can get
[2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:34.240]  away with?
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:39.240]  It's like there's a dam with evil on one side and you open the gate, unlimited evil
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:40.240]  comes in.
[2:40:40.240 --> 2:40:43.360]  How do we shut that gate?
[2:40:43.360 --> 2:40:47.000]  Well, the first thing you have to do in order to shut the gate is realize what's trying
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:51.920]  to get through it and know where the gate is, and most Americans don't.
[2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:57.600]  We think we've built this great wall of freedom and liberty and that we're the freest, best
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:40:59.580]  country in the world.
[2:40:59.580 --> 2:41:00.980]  That's proof positive.
[2:41:00.980 --> 2:41:04.960]  They don't have a clue where the gate is or what the fence means.
[2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:10.560]  It's very much that old story of how do you catch wild pigs?
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:15.600]  Basically, you go out and slowly but surely you lead them to a place where you want to
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:20.280]  feed them and you make them dependent upon that supply of food so that they stop foraging
[2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:22.080]  for themselves.
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:26.280]  Then once they keep coming to where the food is to be found, you slowly but surely build
[2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:30.800]  a pin around the spot till finally one day when they come in to get the food, all you
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:33.480]  got to do is walk up behind them and lock the gate.
[2:41:33.480 --> 2:41:39.800]  Now they're in and that is where we are and people have been indoctrinated into it so
[2:41:39.800 --> 2:41:47.640]  long and so slowly just like these wild pigs, they don't have a clue what happened to them.
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.280]  How do we get out of it?
[2:41:49.280 --> 2:41:55.080]  The first thing is to educate the pigs to recognize what is happening.
[2:41:55.080 --> 2:41:59.320]  Right now, that willful ignorance is playing a big part in preventing that.
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:04.960]  As you said, when you say and do what you do and when I say and do what I do, more people
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:11.160]  are laughing at us because they don't understand out of their ignorance, then there are a dream
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:12.960]  with us and that's why.
[2:42:12.960 --> 2:42:16.800]  They simply don't have a clue what's happening.
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:21.480]  They've been indoctrinated by the schools, they've been indoctrinated by their peers,
[2:42:21.480 --> 2:42:25.680]  they've been taught that their telephone, their text messaging, their Game Boy, their
[2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:32.520]  sports, their news, whatever they have other than being involved in what's being done
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:36.260]  to their country is what's important.
[2:42:36.260 --> 2:42:37.760]  That's where we are.
[2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:39.560]  How do we fix it?
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:45.240]  Wake them up, educate them, show them piece by piece, step by step how they got to the
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:47.720]  point of view they have now.
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:52.960]  There's no guarantee you'll be able to wake them up but there absolutely is a guarantee
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:57.080]  they will never wake up if someone doesn't attempt to wake them up.
[2:42:57.080 --> 2:43:00.360]  Well, what I'm finding is there's record number of people waking up but those that
[2:43:00.360 --> 2:43:04.920]  aren't waking up are just getting deeper into the delusion.
[2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:09.920]  They're moving, they admit the Pentagon and foreign intelligence agencies scan all our
[2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:11.600]  bank accounts in live time.
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:15.160]  We knew that long time ago, now it's admitted, so they can steal it all.
[2:43:15.160 --> 2:43:19.640]  They're devaluing the dollar, they're pushing for forced inoculations which we know are
[2:43:19.640 --> 2:43:23.160]  meant to dumb us down and kill us on record.
[2:43:23.160 --> 2:43:29.320]  We are in a giant high-tech concentration camp on a prison planet and they're turning
[2:43:29.320 --> 2:43:35.640]  the heat up towards getting rid of us and it's all in triplicate and they're set up
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:40.640]  knowing those of us that are aware they want to push us into a civil war so they can get
[2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:41.640]  a hot war going.
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:46.920]  What do you think is going on with the gun bullets, the two billion bullets, the guns,
[2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:50.000]  the tanks, the foreign troops training?
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:53.600]  Are they trying to start a civil war or do they just think that all of that's going
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:54.600]  to protect them?
[2:43:54.600 --> 2:44:03.120]  Well, I think it's probably a mixture of both, I mean DHS is by definition a domestic agency.
[2:44:03.120 --> 2:44:09.560]  They have no extra continental or extraterritorial authority of any kind.
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:15.720]  The only thing they can do is function within the territorial borders of the United States.
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:22.120]  Now the problem there is, is not understanding what the United States is and what it isn't.
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:27.640]  The United States definition in federal law is not within the territorial borders of any
[2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:32.080]  of the several states, it's something completely different.
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:39.040]  So depending upon how your viewpoint is, they intend to use it within the several states.
[2:44:39.040 --> 2:44:46.680]  Making us believe that the United States they're operating in is that, but it's not legally.
[2:44:46.680 --> 2:44:53.240]  The problem there is, is that they have nowhere to use this ammunition or any of these vehicles
[2:44:53.240 --> 2:44:55.120]  except against us.
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:57.000]  It's the only place they're authorized to act.
[2:44:57.000 --> 2:44:58.000]  Oh, they're on record.
[2:44:58.000 --> 2:45:04.840]  They are a fifth branch domestic Northcom army who trains exclusively now to fight gun
[2:45:04.840 --> 2:45:07.560]  owners, returning veterans, conservatives, libertarians.
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:13.800]  They are the foreign occupation army to absorb the old republic into the IMF World Bank,
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:16.880]  of Settlements OECD Receivership.
[2:45:16.880 --> 2:45:24.440]  Well, again, I mean, if the federal constitution was still a valid document and hadn't had
[2:45:24.440 --> 2:45:29.200]  that self-destruct clause built into it, if it was still in existence the way it was supposed
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:32.520]  to be, they're forbidden to have a standing army.
[2:45:32.520 --> 2:45:38.680]  I mean, that's exactly what law enforcement has become, a private standing army to serve
[2:45:38.680 --> 2:45:40.840]  government against the people.
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:47.200]  So DHS is not going to be acting entirely on its own when DHS kicks in whatever this
[2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:53.600]  master plan is going to be for martial law or takeover or inciting riots or just gaining
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:57.200]  general military control of everything.
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:02.040]  They're going to have the full cooperation of a large portion of our local law enforcement
[2:46:02.040 --> 2:46:03.040]  agencies.
[2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:04.040]  That's right.
[2:46:04.040 --> 2:46:07.760]  And that's why they've all come out like in Austin and calling to take the semi-autos,
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:12.680]  you know, to take the clips, to register everybody for total gun confiscation after
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:17.000]  that because they're following the globalist collaborator edicts.
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:19.320]  Well, that's true.
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:26.040]  And again, the problem there is is the people that we have serving us in those capacities
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:31.240]  are just as asleep and ignorant as those that are not in that capacity.
[2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:34.400]  Yeah, that's the average thing is that the average cop, even if they're a listener, I
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:37.200]  talk to them, most of them still don't get.
[2:46:37.200 --> 2:46:41.160]  And I get up here and say the Vici French model of collaborator, I mean, they really
[2:46:41.160 --> 2:46:42.600]  are collaborators.
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:47.600]  It's not that you're a bad person, but you've joined or been born into a family that is
[2:46:47.600 --> 2:46:50.840]  now part of an occupied, controlled police department.
[2:46:50.840 --> 2:46:54.200]  There are some good sheriffs out there and a few good police chiefs and there are a lot
[2:46:54.200 --> 2:46:56.080]  of good police, but it doesn't matter.
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:46:58.400]  You're still in the King's Army.
[2:46:58.400 --> 2:47:00.840]  You're still in the New World Order foreign banker army.
[2:47:00.840 --> 2:47:04.760]  They say at Davos, they've conquered Europe and America.
[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:07.180]  They say we're under a technocracy.
[2:47:07.180 --> 2:47:10.000]  You are now in the New World Order army, boy.
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:11.000]  Go ahead.
[2:47:11.000 --> 2:47:12.600]  Yeah, you're correct.
[2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:14.360]  That is exactly what they're saying.
[2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:19.240]  If you want money from us, this is what you have to do in order to get it.
[2:47:19.240 --> 2:47:23.840]  Now this to me is one of the problems that the states have created for themselves.
[2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:29.600]  When the states agreed to send money to the federal government in any capacity outside
[2:47:29.600 --> 2:47:37.000]  of the 18 enumerated powers, they facilitated their own demise because now you get all this
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:41.640]  money back from a federal government that it should have never had to begin with.
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:47.800]  Now granted, even if the states didn't supply it, they would have just had the Fed print
[2:47:47.800 --> 2:47:49.280]  it.
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:54.320]  So they would have gotten the funding somehow, but again, had the state stuck by what they
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:48:00.640]  were supposed to and actually refused to accept any monetary exchange with the federal
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:08.480]  government that was not entirely gold and silver coin as required, then the Fed could
[2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:13.160]  never be used to facilitate this takeover.
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:14.160]  That's right.
[2:48:14.160 --> 2:48:15.160]  Let's go back to this.
[2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:17.240]  We can see that insurance is how they're going to destroy us.
[2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:19.920]  You got to get healthcare insurance that doubles the first year, of course.
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:22.040]  I mean, it's an industry that makes you buy their product.
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:24.680]  Now they're saying we're just going to make you have insurance to own a gun.
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:27.680]  That's the fact of registration and you wave your rights with it.
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:32.360]  We can really see how they're going to enslave us with insurance, which is the ultimate nanny
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:33.360]  state.
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:34.880]  People are like, well, you got to have insurance, really?
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:38.000]  How do we ever operate before with horses and things?
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:40.480]  If you hurt somebody, you had to go to court.
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:41.920]  You were liable for it.
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:45.800]  And so it was about personal responsibility.
[2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:50.840]  And technically it still is, but they have used exactly the same premise when it comes
[2:48:50.840 --> 2:48:54.680]  to things in the transportation code and the likes of insurance.
[2:48:54.680 --> 2:48:55.680]  It's a scare tactic.
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:58.840]  Well, if you don't have insurance and get into an accident, how are you going to cover
[2:48:58.840 --> 2:49:00.360]  somebody's bills?
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:05.800]  Well, you basically would have been sentenced to provide them with whatever you could for
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:08.640]  as long as you had to to make it up to them.
[2:49:08.640 --> 2:49:12.440]  You would have lost in a court of law for the harm you committed.
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:17.120]  Now granted, that wouldn't have gotten you paid as quickly as an insurance company might.
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:22.480]  But then again, in today's society, you'll wind up taking the insurance company to court
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:28.720]  and they will nine times out of 10 wind up having either no liability or a very limited
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:29.720]  money.
[2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:33.240]  Well, look, I mean, you got foreign banks that are in here lobbying for their insurance
[2:49:33.240 --> 2:49:36.760]  company divisions for us to have to get insurance from them.
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:39.080]  It's the same thing, you know, on guns or anything.
[2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:40.280]  This is their real tyranny.
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:43.280]  This is where we've got to stop them.
[2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:44.400]  Well, you're right.
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:48.840]  But again, by forcing that insurance down our throats and then making us have to fight
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:55.880]  to collect on what we paid for and then saying the insurance company isn't actually liable.
[2:49:55.880 --> 2:50:01.080]  I mean, it's a catch 22 steal the money from the people and never provide them with the
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:02.480]  service they're paying for.
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:06.640]  Well, it's like Monsanto has now been given liability protection with all their poison
[2:50:06.640 --> 2:50:07.640]  products.
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:08.640]  Exactly.
[2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:09.640]  The vaccine makers.
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:11.120]  I mean, this is just lawlessness.
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:17.280]  Well, it's the system protecting its own.
[2:50:17.280 --> 2:50:21.600]  There's no question that Obama would not be where he is without the money from these
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:22.600]  people.
[2:50:22.600 --> 2:50:23.600]  That's right.
[2:50:23.600 --> 2:50:24.600]  People say he's a communist.
[2:50:24.600 --> 2:50:25.600]  He's not.
[2:50:25.600 --> 2:50:30.040]  He works for foreign banks that are mega fascist, but they use communism at the, you know, it's
[2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:31.640]  a two story house, folks.
[2:50:31.640 --> 2:50:34.600]  We're down here in collectivism.
[2:50:34.600 --> 2:50:37.600]  Socialism in the communism, they're all exempt from it.
[2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:39.640]  You're all tied up in the nightmare of red tape.
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:40.640]  They're exempt.
[2:50:40.640 --> 2:50:41.640]  They can fly.
[2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:42.640]  We sleep.
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:43.640]  They live.
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:44.640]  Sleeper awakened.
[2:50:44.640 --> 2:50:47.640]  And at the police out there, look, you're a human being.
[2:50:47.640 --> 2:50:48.640]  I care about you.
[2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:49.640]  I don't hate you.
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:53.560]  But you're just like the general public brainwashed.
[2:50:53.560 --> 2:50:57.840]  Are you a biological Android or are you a sentient being with a spirit?
[2:50:57.840 --> 2:51:01.480]  All those that have a spirit can hear me.
[2:51:01.480 --> 2:51:06.920]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011.
[2:51:06.920 --> 2:51:11.200]  Storms and floods raged across the U.S. costing us 20 billion and lost crops alone.
[2:51:11.200 --> 2:51:15.240]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[2:51:15.240 --> 2:51:19.080]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:20.520]  The fact is, you are.
[2:51:20.520 --> 2:51:21.680]  We all are.
[2:51:21.680 --> 2:51:24.160]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[2:51:24.160 --> 2:51:28.920]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:32.600]  the cost and availability of your food supply with eFood Direct.
[2:51:32.600 --> 2:51:34.080]  Be prepared before you need it.

[2:51:37.480 --> 2:51:39.840]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[2:51:39.840 --> 2:51:43.480]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, horrible foods out there from
[2:51:43.480 --> 2:51:44.480]  eFood Direct.

[2:52:00.640 --> 2:52:04.640]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[2:52:04.640 --> 2:52:05.640]  Box.
[2:52:05.640 --> 2:52:08.560]  I want you to know some very important information.
[2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:13.360]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:17.640]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:23.280]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[2:52:23.280 --> 2:52:28.360]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:33.480]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[2:52:33.480 --> 2:52:34.640]  normal cell.
[2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:39.080]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells
[2:52:39.080 --> 2:52:42.360]  to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[2:52:42.360 --> 2:52:46.720]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[2:52:46.720 --> 2:52:50.280]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[2:52:50.280 --> 2:52:57.680]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[2:52:57.680 --> 2:52:58.680]  Protect your immune system.
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:53:00.160]  It's the only one you've got.
[2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:04.880]  Chicago is a virtual battlefield, more than 500 shooting deaths in 2012 have made Chicago
[2:53:04.880 --> 2:53:06.400]  the murder capital of America.
[2:53:06.400 --> 2:53:10.440]  Proof that gun control doesn't work, disarming law-abiding citizens ensures that only criminals
[2:53:10.440 --> 2:53:14.440]  have guns, and Rom Emanuel and the Chicago Machine want to keep it that way.
[2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:18.000]  If we can't stop them in Chicago, we may lose the whole battle, but there's hope.
[2:53:18.000 --> 2:53:22.400]  On April 9th, we have a chance to send billionaire Mike Bloomberg, Rom Emanuel and his Chicago
[2:53:22.400 --> 2:53:26.760]  Machine a crystal clear message, that we have a natural right to defend ourselves, our homes
[2:53:26.760 --> 2:53:30.000]  and our families, and that they need to keep their hands off our guns.
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:34.360]  Illinois Republican Paul McKinley is sending that message in a bitterly false special election
[2:53:34.360 --> 2:53:38.920]  to replace disgraced ex-rep Jesse Jackson Jr. Every vote, every voice in support of Paul
[2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:42.200]  McKinley is a stand against the gun-grabbing Chicago Machine.
[2:53:42.200 --> 2:53:44.080]  Will you stand up and defend your gun rights?
[2:53:44.080 --> 2:53:49.600]  Call 800-979-1555, 800-979-1555.
[2:53:49.600 --> 2:54:01.160]  Paid for by T-Party Leadership Fund, back, not authorized by any candidate or candidates
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:04.920]  committee, thetpartyleadershipfund.com.
[2:54:04.920 --> 2:54:14.800]  You know, I was just talking about Janet Reno during the break, back during the Nightly
[2:54:14.800 --> 2:54:20.560]  News TV office, and Rob Duce said, whatever happened to Janet Reno, and I said, well,
[2:54:20.560 --> 2:54:22.840]  she's probably pretty sick from Parkinson's.
[2:54:22.840 --> 2:54:28.760]  She had it really bad when I confronted her about Waco 13, 14 years ago when she was still
[2:54:28.760 --> 2:54:29.760]  Attorney General.
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:31.680]  But let's punch her up here on screen.
[2:54:31.680 --> 2:54:35.320]  You know, when she was a district attorney down in Florida, she reportedly liked to check
[2:54:35.320 --> 2:54:40.520]  little kids out that CPS had taken, and well, let's just say take them for a little ride.
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:45.680]  And one time, a state trooper found her, vomit all over her in the naked 13-year-old in the
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:46.680]  back of a car.
[2:54:46.680 --> 2:54:49.680]  I thought you could look that up, that was actually in the local paper.
[2:54:49.680 --> 2:54:54.720]  And that's when Bill Clinton said, a few years later, man, that's who we need to hire.
[2:54:54.720 --> 2:55:01.000]  Can you imagine me and little kid, and that's coming after you?
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:04.800]  And Eddie, you know, it's more than just ignorant people in the system, they hire a bunch of
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:05.800]  scum.
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:08.360]  What about this case up in Williamson County that's now come out where they knew the guy
[2:55:08.360 --> 2:55:13.000]  was innocent, but, you know, had him in jail and tried to suppress the bandana?
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:19.200]  But the Michael Mortensen case, I mean, it just shows how evil these systems are.
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:25.080]  Why is Williamson County listed by some groups as the most corrupt county in America?
[2:55:25.080 --> 2:55:27.360]  Because it is.
[2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:34.080]  I mean, I actually, I'm sure you've heard about her, but the attorney that they raked
[2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:39.520]  over the calls over there that was fighting for the rights of the people that were being
[2:55:39.520 --> 2:55:46.520]  accused in Williamson County courts, they actually railroaded her into an asylum here
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:47.760]  in Texas.
[2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:51.080]  I was at her initial trial.
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:54.520]  The judge that sat up there had no oath of office to be sitting.
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:55:57.640]  He hadn't taken an oath since 1999.
[2:55:57.640 --> 2:56:04.280]  He is a visiting judge, Texas law specifically requires that all visiting judges retake the
[2:56:04.280 --> 2:56:09.680]  oath of office each time they sit on the bench in a case.
[2:56:09.680 --> 2:56:14.280]  Anytime they sit down in a new instance, they have to retake that oath.
[2:56:14.280 --> 2:56:21.440]  Now on top of that, he completely violated Texas law on procedures for commitments.
[2:56:21.440 --> 2:56:26.240]  He violated 900 different ways at every turn.
[2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:30.440]  They refused to allow Carolyn Barnes to defend herself.
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:34.520]  They refused to allow her to obtain a proper attorney.
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:40.240]  The one that they gave her did everything he could to undermine her defense and assist
[2:56:40.240 --> 2:56:47.280]  the court in getting her committed to the point of signing agreements without her consent.
[2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:53.320]  It is the most lawless corrupt county that you will find short of Minnesota where the
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:57:00.720]  judges get to create law from the bitch by complete permission of the legislature there.
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:06.200]  There's actually a statute on the books in Minnesota that says the courts may create
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:12.440]  the law and form it as they de-necessary for proceeding.
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:17.680]  It really is incredible that we've gotten to this point.
[2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.840]  I was talking about the Michael Morton case where even when new district attorneys came
[2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:26.880]  in and knew he was innocent, they fought to keep him behind bars.
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:30.400]  What is it about Williamson County where they love putting innocent people in jail with
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:34.680]  no criminal record because I've covered it, I've seen it.
[2:57:34.680 --> 2:57:38.960]  Williamson County actually doesn't like good people.
[2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:41.160]  Well, it's beyond that.
[2:57:41.160 --> 2:57:45.320]  It really has nothing to do with good, bad, or anything else.
[2:57:45.320 --> 2:57:50.440]  It has to do with the same thing that it always does, money.
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:55.400]  The more people they have in the system, the more money they generate from the federal
[2:57:55.400 --> 2:57:56.400]  government.
[2:57:56.400 --> 2:58:03.720]  Most people are not aware that every jail in America, county, city, whatever, that receives
[2:58:03.720 --> 2:58:09.880]  federal funding gets paid according to incarceration headcount.
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:18.680]  Whoever is currently in the jail at a certain time of day, twice a day, then the system
[2:58:18.680 --> 2:58:22.000]  pays them X amount of dollars per head.
[2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:24.800]  And again, why are the feds involved in that?
[2:58:24.800 --> 2:58:29.560]  And now you've got the big Wackenhut prisons getting state laws passed to guarantee 90%
[2:58:29.560 --> 2:58:30.560]  occupancy.
[2:58:30.560 --> 2:58:33.560]  And that's why everybody they're teaching you you're a criminal, because most of us
[2:58:33.560 --> 2:58:38.240]  are going into jail and they're going to take our property, our guns, our children,
[2:58:38.240 --> 2:58:43.000]  and finally they're going to blow our brains out.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:46.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:28.360]  Nick and Michael.
[3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:30.800]  I'm going to get Eddie Craig in here for a full hour next week and then two hours in
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:31.800]  the nightly news.
[3:00:31.800 --> 3:00:36.560]  I'm going to play out some very good knowledge that still while there's some bill of rights
[3:00:36.560 --> 3:00:39.560]  the Constitution left has quite a big effect.
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:43.680]  Michael, no, no, no, the first Mika, Mika in Texas, you're on the air with Eddie Craig.
[3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:44.680]  Go ahead.
[3:00:44.680 --> 3:00:45.680]  Greetings, guys.
[3:00:45.680 --> 3:00:47.200]  It's great to talk to you again.
[3:00:47.200 --> 3:00:49.280]  My name is actually Michael Coleman.
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:50.280]  I apologize.
[3:00:50.280 --> 3:00:51.960]  I read it in Mika.
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:52.960]  I'm an idiot.
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:53.960]  Michael.
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:54.960]  You all good?
[3:00:54.960 --> 3:00:55.960]  Yes, sir.
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:00:59.680]  I'm actually playing the part of Paul Rear, the anniversary of his ride.
[3:00:59.680 --> 3:01:03.120]  I wanted to give an update to your listeners since last time I spoke with you.
[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:04.120]  Sure.
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:06.120]  Give me a huge favor and turn your radio off.
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:07.120]  Oh, sorry.
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:08.120]  It's one second.
[3:01:08.120 --> 3:01:11.880]  Yeah, I don't understand, people.
[3:01:11.880 --> 3:01:13.800]  You can't be on radio with your radio on.
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:14.800]  Tell me what.
[3:01:14.800 --> 3:01:15.800]  Email me some info.
[3:01:15.800 --> 3:01:16.800]  I got to let you go.
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:17.800]  It sounds like the radio is still on.
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:18.880]  Thank you very much, Mika.
[3:01:18.880 --> 3:01:20.880]  Just email me the info.
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:21.880]  I'd like to talk about it.
[3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:24.160]  Maybe I was talking about covering with my crew.
[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:25.880]  Send an email to Showtips.
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:26.880]  Okay.
[3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:27.880]  Yeah.
[3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:28.880]  Let's go ahead.
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:30.880]  I've got feedback going on the board.
[3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:33.640]  Let's go ahead and go to Jason in Connecticut.
[3:01:33.640 --> 3:01:35.000]  Jason, you're on the air.
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  Go ahead.
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  Hey, Alex.
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  How are you doing?
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  Pretty good.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:43.160]  I was something that really concerned me yesterday.
[3:01:43.160 --> 3:01:45.040]  My father-in-law passed away a few years ago.
[3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:48.040]  He had a pretty cool gun collection.
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:51.480]  My mother-in-law came by the house last night and I saw she had a long list of stuff.
[3:01:51.480 --> 3:01:52.480]  I said, what's that?
[3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:58.080]  She said the homeowner's insurance wants a list of all dad's guns and serial numbers
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:01:59.080]  and everything.
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:00.800]  And I said, when did that start?
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:02.800]  When did you have to start supplying something like that?
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:03.800]  Is that normal?
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:04.960]  It just really concerns me.
[3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:05.960]  No, no.
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:07.440]  The insurance companies are the government.
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:08.440]  They're foreign banks.
[3:02:08.440 --> 3:02:09.600]  They are the occupiers.
[3:02:09.600 --> 3:02:11.640]  They're going to make you turn your guns in.
[3:02:11.640 --> 3:02:15.640]  That's why they're going to make you pay to have guns under new insurance like Obamacare
[3:02:15.640 --> 3:02:19.800]  started in Chicago six months before it was law.
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:25.960]  So yes, the insurance companies are already moving to make you de facto register your
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:27.960]  guns and then they will confiscate them.
[3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:28.960]  You've done it everywhere else.
[3:02:28.960 --> 3:02:31.360]  The insurance companies are now the enemy.
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:32.720]  No one should be with the big ones.
[3:02:32.720 --> 3:02:33.720]  Bare minimum.
[3:02:33.720 --> 3:02:37.560]  You're with the small one, but no one should be with big insurance companies.
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:39.480]  They are criminal organizations.
[3:02:39.480 --> 3:02:40.480]  Eddie Craig.
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:42.960]  Well, I would agree with that.
[3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:49.360]  I mean, you used to when you were forced to pay for insurance in case something bad happened,
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:50.680]  they called that racketeering.
[3:02:50.680 --> 3:02:54.520]  Yeah, the mafia came and said, we're going to burn down your grocery store if you don't
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:02:55.520]  buy insurance.
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:02:58.240]  I mean, people run it today.
[3:02:58.240 --> 3:02:59.240]  Exactly.
[3:02:59.240 --> 3:03:02.080]  Now, like, give me a list of your guns and I know you're going to do it.
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:05.040]  And the average American poops or pants says, yes, sir.
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:11.000]  Yeah, I mean, and the problem is, is now the power of the state is making that racketeering
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  legal.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:15.120]  Yeah, we have them off your government.
[3:03:15.120 --> 3:03:16.560]  So there you go, sir.
[3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:21.080]  Obviously they're going to want guns, quote, if they got stolen, but I mean, generally
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:24.240]  you just have photographs of stuff and then if it came up, they got stolen.
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:25.760]  We just proved you had them.
[3:03:25.760 --> 3:03:26.760]  It's for gun confiscation.
[3:03:26.760 --> 3:03:27.760]  All right.
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:28.760]  Yeah.
[3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:29.760]  Yeah.
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:30.760]  And the serial numbers and everything.
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:31.760]  That's crazy.
[3:03:31.760 --> 3:03:32.760]  Hey, guys, thank you very much for everything you guys do.
[3:03:32.760 --> 3:03:33.760]  I appreciate it.
[3:03:33.760 --> 3:03:34.760]  You bet.
[3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:35.760]  No, no, no.
[3:03:35.760 --> 3:03:39.720]  I remember seeing an article in 2002, headline scoff loss caught when ordering pizzas.
[3:03:39.720 --> 3:03:45.560]  USA Today was a 2004 and when you call to get a pizza or anything, they run you through
[3:03:45.560 --> 3:03:49.880]  a database to see if you have a warrant instead of a pizza, you got a SWAT team.
[3:03:49.880 --> 3:03:53.520]  Everything's surveilled and they're turning everyone into agents under the Cybersecurity
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:54.520]  Act.
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:59.240]  Anyone with IT with over 100 customers under federal law has to spy on everybody.
[3:03:59.240 --> 3:04:03.240]  We're refusing to do it, but I mean, it's just total evil.
[3:04:03.240 --> 3:04:04.240]  It's total evil.
[3:04:04.240 --> 3:04:06.240]  The government is cancer.
[3:04:06.240 --> 3:04:07.240]  Eddie Craig.
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:09.520]  Well, I agreed.
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:14.480]  It's gotten way out of control and but the problem is, is we're doing nothing to put
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:15.480]  it back.
[3:04:15.480 --> 3:04:19.160]  You were speaking before about people waking up in record numbers.
[3:04:19.160 --> 3:04:22.880]  Well, the wake is good, but what are they doing?
[3:04:22.880 --> 3:04:25.280]  I agree.
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:26.560]  I mean that that's the problem.
[3:04:26.560 --> 3:04:29.080]  How long ago did you wake up, Eddie?
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:36.520]  I woke up probably just before the mid nineties when I started seeing what they were doing.
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:41.880]  My real battle started when the county tax assessor tried to take my mother's property
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:46.480]  and I started studying the Texas tax code to find out how they were doing what they
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:47.980]  were doing.
[3:04:47.980 --> 3:04:52.960]  What I found enabled me to make them back off and leave her alone.
[3:04:52.960 --> 3:04:53.960]  Absolutely.
[3:04:53.960 --> 3:04:56.120]  They are criminals, criminals, criminals.
[3:04:56.120 --> 3:04:57.120]  Thank you, sir.
[3:04:57.120 --> 3:05:20.300]  Well, I built something if you can just steal it.
