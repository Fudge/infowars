[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:38.920]  Texas Alex Jones it is Wednesday the 24th day of August 2011 after 42 years in
[00:38.920 --> 00:45.240]  power Moammar Gaddafi has reportedly been driven from Tripoli if we were to
[00:45.240 --> 00:51.080]  believe these new radio transmissions that he's been putting out the Al Qaeda
[00:51.080 --> 01:00.720]  forces have officially entered under NATO protection into the government
[01:00.720 --> 01:09.640]  complexes and the new Civil War quagmire can begin and Gaddafi is telling
[01:09.640 --> 01:16.080]  a different tribal groups around the country to begin attacking the quote
[01:16.080 --> 01:20.960]  new Al Qaeda government and it is an Al Qaeda government just last night I was
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.360]  doing some more research on it and ran across more than 10 different mainstream
[01:25.360 --> 01:34.600]  news articles where they admit that this is Al Qaeda that's the dominant group
[01:34.600 --> 01:39.600]  and that Sharia law will now be put into effect which should make a lot of
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.280]  the neocons and others very very happy because now they can have this clash of
[01:44.280 --> 01:51.560]  civilizations between the West and the quote extremist which is the central
[01:51.560 --> 01:57.200]  banking cartels plan see people tend to think of it as America versus the Muslims
[01:57.200 --> 02:03.600]  or America versus the Chinese or vice versa or hey Moody's down great at
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.800]  Japan isn't that great their economy is falling apart will do better that's not
[02:07.800 --> 02:13.600]  how economies really work this will only hurt the United States that Japan is
[02:13.600 --> 02:18.560]  slipping in to a well it's been in a deeper session for 15 years which you
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.640]  could call a depression on the heels of Fukushima disaster so we tend to think
[02:23.640 --> 02:27.640]  of this as nation-states but really it's global special interests that are
[02:27.640 --> 02:33.680]  above the law perching and sitting upon the nation-states playing us off
[02:33.680 --> 02:41.120]  against each other so that is some of the news some of the information that we
[02:41.120 --> 02:49.200]  are going to be going over and breaking it down today now obviously we'll get
[02:49.200 --> 02:55.960]  more into US East Coast may be at risk for aftershocks the yesterday's 5.9 it
[02:55.960 --> 03:01.760]  was a 5.8 upgraded to a 5.9 also a strong East Coast quake highly
[03:01.760 --> 03:06.080]  unusual seismologists and other scientists that study earthquakes and
[03:06.080 --> 03:10.960]  other geological activities have said cracks discovered in the Washington
[03:10.960 --> 03:16.960]  monument a nuclear plant near epicenter of course shut down yesterday as a
[03:16.960 --> 03:20.520]  precaution problem is that there's a real disaster the government has a
[03:20.520 --> 03:24.600]  history of covering that up so we don't know also witnesses saw DC building
[03:24.600 --> 03:28.920]  shake during 5.9 earthquake that affected eight different states and was
[03:28.920 --> 03:37.840]  felt all the way in to Canada so that is also coming up today and on the Libya
[03:37.840 --> 03:43.640]  front there's lots of hype now about Gaddafi and rebels in hiding and will
[03:43.640 --> 03:49.160]  they release a dirty bomb on us now and can homeland security eradicate all of
[03:49.160 --> 03:54.480]  our rights to keep us safe for the bankers to rape us up excuse me sorry
[03:54.480 --> 04:01.280]  had a Freudian slip keep us safe from al-Qaeda who is Gaddafi but he's
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.760]  actually not al-Qaeda al-Qaeda is the new government but what are you going to
[04:06.760 --> 04:11.280]  do at the end of the day so that is some of the news I'll be breaking down on
[04:11.280 --> 04:16.880]  that front also some interesting news Ron Paul picks up steam despite minimal
[04:16.880 --> 04:26.000]  media coverage KHOU television is covering that here in Texas so he is
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.120]  winning more and more of the polls or in a dead heat with Mitt Romney Rick Perry
[04:30.120 --> 04:35.840]  and Michelle Bachman that's all the systems still ignoring him he still gets
[04:35.840 --> 04:39.360]  the least amount of coverage of any of the candidates even candidates that don't
[04:39.360 --> 04:43.160]  even show up five percentage points in the polls get lavish with two three four
[04:43.160 --> 04:47.760]  times the coverage that Ron Paul gets so we're gonna be going over that and wide

[07:25.280 --> 07:29.860]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[08:42.280 --> 08:46.720]  giving a toll-free number out here in a few minutes after I have gone over some
[08:46.720 --> 08:51.720]  of the news then coming up for about 30 minutes we're part of the third hour
[08:51.720 --> 08:56.120]  Gatewood Galmarith a perennial candidate and well-known political activists
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.000]  across the country based in Kentucky is going to be coming on to discuss this
[09:00.000 --> 09:07.880]  news article out of alternate how JP Morgan took over all of Kentucky's
[09:07.880 --> 09:15.600]  financial services and why you should be scared and it just shows the complete
[09:15.600 --> 09:21.800]  and total financial domination of this country so he'll be joining us coming up
[09:21.800 --> 09:25.960]  and I have other little interesting tidbits of news the foreign ownership of
[09:25.960 --> 09:32.960]  our media is accelerating Carlos Slim increases
[09:32.960 --> 09:44.440]  Slim increases his stake in New York Times Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim
[09:44.440 --> 09:49.160]  has increased his stake in the New York Times Company just weeks after the US
[09:49.160 --> 09:55.000]  newspaper group repaid the emergency quarter billion dollar loan it took
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.200]  for mr. Slim in 2009 and he's now up to stake from six point nine percent to
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.600]  seven point three percent that's out of the financial times of London mr. Slim
[10:06.600 --> 10:11.440]  who made his money with a telecommunications monopoly in Mexico
[10:11.440 --> 10:18.560]  and other ways so interesting to see that going on but I mean what's it
[10:18.560 --> 10:24.760]  matter of a monopolist baron out of Mexico is buying larger stakes or of
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.920]  the Saudis own the largest percentages of Fox News Corps I mean at the end of
[10:29.920 --> 10:36.480]  the day US taxpayer money has been reportedly pumped into MSNBC you name
[10:36.480 --> 10:42.160]  it it's all just a bunch of propaganda and that's why the establishment is so
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.520]  secure in their takeover of this country in the rest of the world because they
[10:46.520 --> 10:50.280]  get away with bloody murder now I want to get into the financial news the big
[10:50.280 --> 10:56.720]  developments in Libya the earthquake news and more but but first this morning
[10:56.720 --> 11:06.320]  it hit me and it hits me all the time but it really hit me that we've gone
[11:06.320 --> 11:12.680]  over the edge we're not on the edge we're over the edge when it comes to
[11:12.680 --> 11:19.840]  historical corruption and tyranny really really blooming really growing this
[11:19.840 --> 11:26.120]  country is is just overrun by corrupt individuals carrying out corrupt
[11:26.120 --> 11:32.680]  practices our economy is more and more converting from a free market free
[11:32.680 --> 11:39.680]  society to a crony insider monopoly system and that can only happen because
[11:39.680 --> 11:47.080]  we have several generations of very spoiled people very entitled people who
[11:47.080 --> 11:53.080]  are so self-centered that even as they lose their productivity their future
[11:53.080 --> 11:58.600]  and their standard of living they still don't want to get up and get involved
[11:58.600 --> 12:03.320]  and take their country back those that are politically involved are somewhat
[12:03.320 --> 12:08.480]  awake across the spectrum but they really don't get the the the the finer
[12:08.480 --> 12:15.920]  details and they also miss the larger backdrop of of mega banks powerful
[12:15.920 --> 12:25.760]  families insiders huge huge combines that have a decidedly anti-human
[12:25.760 --> 12:34.960]  anti-family anti-free market really hyper authoritarian mindset and I've
[12:34.960 --> 12:42.800]  talked a lot about this if you've studied history you know that dictators
[12:42.800 --> 12:51.440]  corrupt oligarchies endless wars torture secret arrest power tripping
[12:51.440 --> 13:00.560]  ruling classes demanding your daughters service them going into farming belts and
[13:00.560 --> 13:07.880]  massacring everybody powerful elites when when they're not opposed run rampant
[13:07.880 --> 13:14.080]  because it's their nature they like overrunning they like burning cities they
[13:14.080 --> 13:21.520]  like wars they don't like commerce they use monopoly commerce to destroy real
[13:21.520 --> 13:29.080]  commerce it's a scorched earth mindset a spirit of total monopoly that that
[13:29.080 --> 13:35.960]  sees any form of independence strength or beauty as its enemy and in the final
[13:35.960 --> 13:44.120]  equation that's why I am fearless that's why I am willing to sacrifice my
[13:44.120 --> 13:52.400]  time my energy my name in this fight I know that the road I'm on does not lead
[13:52.400 --> 14:02.720]  to a very happy place individually but history also shows that when things start
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.480]  to get dark when things start to get really bad that's when the best in
[14:08.480 --> 14:15.080]  humanity shines and that if we counter the deceptive narrative of the
[14:15.080 --> 14:20.720]  globalist and their false global economic political spiritual paradigm
[14:20.720 --> 14:29.200]  that we can trailblaze and really give the population an alternative to the
[14:29.200 --> 14:40.120]  globalist model and we are in a race we are in a race for our very existence our
[14:40.120 --> 14:51.680]  very future I don't want to say that I'm depressed I'm not depressed I'm more
[14:51.680 --> 14:59.040]  chastened or chilled I don't mean chilled in a relaxed way sitting back in
[14:59.040 --> 15:05.920]  an easy chair drinking a dosseki's like mr. tough guy I mean chilled to the bone
[15:05.920 --> 15:10.360]  with the realization that
[15:10.360 --> 15:27.080]  history's roadmap has served us well and that my analysis Ron Paul's prognosis
[15:27.080 --> 15:34.720]  other historians view and assessment of our situation was absolutely on target
[15:34.720 --> 15:43.800]  except in one facet we tend to underestimate evil we tend to underestimate
[15:43.800 --> 15:58.520]  avarice and greed and hatred and corruption it is the great plenty it is
[15:58.520 --> 16:14.960]  the prosperity that liberty generated that freedom generated that triggered the
[16:14.960 --> 16:19.600]  corrupt power elite and the robber barons to focus their energies on the
[16:19.600 --> 16:26.560]  United States to then overtake it and use that wealth and prowess to take over
[16:26.560 --> 16:34.840]  the world while at the same time destroying our republic from the inside
[16:41.400 --> 16:46.040]  and it is because there's still so much food on the table and so much
[16:46.040 --> 16:50.280]  entertainment that even as the oxygen is taken out of the room even as our
[16:50.280 --> 16:55.360]  society rots and the roads fall apart and the police are laid off and the
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.320]  taxes go up and as the borders are opened and as the illegals are legalized
[17:00.320 --> 17:07.600]  as the country rots into the ground it does it incrementally so that still the
[17:07.600 --> 17:12.840]  average person can't recognize it people are starting to see it starting to smell
[17:12.840 --> 17:20.920]  it but if the general public could know what I know or could know what Ron Paul
[17:20.920 --> 17:25.640]  knows or what other people who've studied common sense and history know
[17:25.640 --> 17:31.960]  people would be repenting and by repenting I'm not even if you're not a
[17:31.960 --> 17:37.160]  Christian I mean repenting saying I'm angry at myself for not doing more for
[17:37.160 --> 17:41.800]  not being informed for being lazy for valuing things that don't really have
[17:41.800 --> 17:47.200]  value and and and and not appreciating things that really are the heart of
[17:47.200 --> 17:55.800]  civilization the heart of freedom bondage is a horrible thing the
[17:55.800 --> 18:02.760]  humiliation of not being a free man and not controlling your own destiny is a
[18:02.760 --> 18:05.840]  thousand deaths
[18:07.600 --> 18:14.160]  a person of courage only dies one death but a coward a slave dies thousands of
[18:14.160 --> 18:27.120]  deaths and I see the excesses and the wanton prosecution of tyranny against
[18:27.120 --> 18:33.920]  every form of goodness and the religious fervor with which the system
[18:33.920 --> 18:39.680]  destroys the republic destroys the bill of rights destroys the Constitution I
[18:39.680 --> 18:51.640]  am watching our shields fall the hedge fall I'm watching what our forebears
[18:51.640 --> 18:58.520]  built a system to protect the individual and to protect
[18:58.520 --> 19:12.760]  basic freedom I am watching it burn up before my eyes like a city on fire
[19:12.760 --> 19:22.480]  collapse daily things that the globalist would only attack from the side with a
[19:22.480 --> 19:28.680]  glancing blow things that they would only chew at on the edges or decades they
[19:28.680 --> 19:33.800]  are now just wrecking balls to the war powers act wrecking balls the power of
[19:33.800 --> 19:40.120]  the purse wrecking balls to congress with the super congress wrecking balls to
[19:40.120 --> 19:46.240]  the second amendment wrecking balls to sovereignty in the border I mean they are
[19:46.240 --> 19:52.880]  just it is all being destroyed right now anyway you look at it we now have a

[24:18.560 --> 24:26.160]  so Muammar Gaddafi is vowing to fight for years and it's buried all over the
[24:26.160 --> 24:31.880]  even mainstream media that the main rebel force is real Al Qaeda that these
[24:31.880 --> 24:38.600]  are rebels that fought us forces in Iraq and that they are now to be given
[24:38.600 --> 24:51.160]  control of the government of Libya and undoubtedly now they will let these
[24:51.160 --> 24:56.480]  groups attack the United States and then simply take more of our liberty see
[24:56.480 --> 25:03.560]  see that's the masterpiece that is stage terror but don't forget what CNN and
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.400]  Fox News are both reporting first responders to cry exclusion from 9
[25:07.400 --> 25:16.920]  11 ceremony they are not allowed to be there the government says well we're
[25:16.920 --> 25:22.280]  gonna try to recognize you but you're not allowed into ground zero only the
[25:22.280 --> 25:28.080]  politicians are why is that well it's because most of these responders are
[25:28.080 --> 25:32.880]  mad about the fact that they have been denied health care for nine plus years
[25:32.880 --> 25:37.160]  when they finally were authorized to get it they have to go through homeland
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.640]  security every time they access health care to quote check them to make sure
[25:42.640 --> 25:47.840]  they're not terrorist and all over the country and many different types of jobs
[25:47.840 --> 25:52.840]  now including union jobs you have to get homeland security authorization before
[25:52.840 --> 25:57.640]  you can have that job and I'm talking about janitorial jobs street sweeping
[25:57.640 --> 26:03.000]  jobs see the war on terror is about making us all prisoners who've got to
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  get government permission even if you've never committed a crime to buy a gun to
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.720]  have a job to travel that's the essence of an internal checkpoint in an
[26:14.720 --> 26:18.440]  authoritarian system but it's all done to fight the terrorist and then
[26:18.440 --> 26:26.000]  meanwhile real al-Qaeda for six years has been
[26:26.800 --> 26:29.880]  attacking
[26:29.880 --> 26:36.120]  the Iranians in stage terror attacks in their country to undermine that
[26:36.120 --> 26:43.160]  government and our own supposed government admits it and then they're
[26:43.160 --> 26:46.000]  used against the Serbs they're used against the Russians they're used
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.520]  against Qaddafi as I've told you some have been laudan with CIA created and
[26:51.520 --> 27:02.120]  trained 9-11 was a staged event the official story is a fraud and 9-11 has
[27:02.120 --> 27:07.840]  been used to burn our republic to the ground we're now just basically more
[27:07.840 --> 27:12.400]  real estate if we don't have that bill of rights if we don't have that
[27:12.400 --> 27:22.480]  Constitution then we're just more dirt like North Korea or Mexico or Russia
[27:22.480 --> 27:29.040]  China Joe Biden yesterday said he totally understands China's one-child policy
[27:29.040 --> 27:32.840]  and doesn't have a problem with it I bet he doesn't have a problem with it it
[27:32.840 --> 27:36.680]  was the United States went over there and signed an agreement to industrialize
[27:36.680 --> 27:42.240]  China and to sign tax deals to ship our jobs there in the mid 1970s you've seen
[27:42.240 --> 27:47.400]  the results of that if China would reduce their population that's how
[27:47.400 --> 27:55.280]  important it is to the globalists to kill people this is a command and control
[27:55.280 --> 28:01.920]  system meant to level society meant to bring us back to the Stone Age all the
[28:01.920 --> 28:09.760]  elites behind their national security cordons enjoy the advanced
[28:09.760 --> 28:15.600]  technologies that our tax money has financed the development of
[28:18.880 --> 28:23.400]  you know until just about three years ago all over the world it was in basic
[28:23.400 --> 28:29.560]  medical handbooks not to give a pregnant woman vaccines now they tell them
[28:29.560 --> 28:34.840]  vaccinate pregnant women first and often causes all sorts of neurological
[28:34.840 --> 28:39.520]  disorders brain damage in the baby that's admitted I've got an article by a
[28:39.520 --> 28:47.560]  medical doctor today Dr. Mark circus vaccine assault on children by world
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.480]  government and it goes through the fact that they go into areas with
[28:51.480 --> 28:56.720]  debilitated and already sick children who they know are sick and inject them
[28:56.720 --> 29:04.640]  knowing it's going to absolutely devastate them all over the world I see
[29:04.640 --> 29:09.200]  articles coming out every week now where they give people more shots filled
[29:09.200 --> 29:16.520]  with sterilants filled with live viruses polio with live virus and I just sit
[29:16.520 --> 29:22.160]  here and watch the scientific dictatorship spiking our food spiking
[29:22.160 --> 29:26.920]  our water spiking our air admitting they're chemtrailing us now and they
[29:26.920 --> 29:31.840]  just sit there and you watch the adult brain damage population squirming and
[29:31.840 --> 29:35.880]  flopping around and I watch the globalists like a cat playing with a
[29:35.880 --> 29:42.160]  mouse is torturing humanity and getting away with it and just stealing and
[29:42.160 --> 29:47.320]  robbing and it's got to come to an end humanity must awaken all right I'll get

[33:40.200 --> 33:45.920]  we are back live we're gonna have open phones and a ton of news now that I've
[33:45.920 --> 33:52.240]  had a few segments to pontificate about the fact that a effective dictatorship
[33:52.240 --> 33:59.120]  of the bureaucracy itself financed and peopled by members of the Fortune 100
[33:59.120 --> 34:06.000]  that control government via the revolving door and of course their
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.960]  political contributions but that's a small part of it it's the it's the payoffs
[34:09.960 --> 34:14.200]  by hiring politicians and generals once they get out of government and then go
[34:14.200 --> 34:19.160]  back into government it's the payoffs by hiring their wives and their children I
[34:19.160 --> 34:24.040]  mean this is a system where big corporations can come in pay government
[34:24.040 --> 34:29.320]  off and government will openly let them write the regulations to shut down
[34:29.320 --> 34:35.080]  their competition it is the essence of true discrimination but notice people
[34:35.080 --> 34:41.600]  only think about discrimination in terms of what color someone is now the toll

[34:49.600 --> 34:58.080]  800 259 9231 getting briefly back to the first responders being barred from the
[34:58.080 --> 35:03.680]  10th anniversary that's not a joke I was on man Cal Muller's syndicated radio
[35:03.680 --> 35:09.760]  show today as I am every Wednesday as a guest 15 minutes or so and I brought
[35:09.760 --> 35:13.840]  this up to him and he didn't believe it at first and then it went and then his
[35:13.840 --> 35:21.480]  producers were able to pull up associated press New York Times CNN that
[35:21.480 --> 35:26.920]  indeed they're not allowed in ground zero with the thousands of people only
[35:26.920 --> 35:31.040]  the politicians and corporate chiefs are allowed there to talk about the heroes
[35:31.040 --> 35:36.080]  of 9-11 and sell giving up our liberties because the first responders
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.160]  want us to give up our freedoms but they're not allowed to be there because
[35:40.160 --> 35:45.040]  most of them don't buy the official story the vast majority I've met hundreds
[35:45.040 --> 35:51.640]  of them again I would go down there five six years ago and would get flipped off
[35:51.640 --> 35:56.760]  some would get yelled at by some of the firemen some of the police who were
[35:56.760 --> 36:00.840]  there for the memorial some of them a lot of them shook my hand pat me on the
[36:00.840 --> 36:03.840]  back and gave us interviews we've interviewed quite a few police officers
[36:03.840 --> 36:10.320]  firefighters medics and others the last time I was there wow it's now three years
[36:10.320 --> 36:13.360]  ago I haven't been back in three years or is it you know it's it'll be three
[36:13.360 --> 36:19.160]  years this year I couldn't walk down the street I mean it was commanders and
[36:19.160 --> 36:24.800]  captains and firefighters and police now there were a few Marines one guy was
[36:24.800 --> 36:28.360]  leading a horse he was part of a parade he flipped us off we have video that and
[36:28.360 --> 36:32.160]  posted on the web and later we ran into him in a restaurant and of course he
[36:32.160 --> 36:36.840]  wasn't there on 9-11 but you know he flipped us off and thought that was real
[36:36.840 --> 36:41.840]  tough that we were out there saying 9-11 was an inside job but you're there
[36:41.840 --> 36:46.680]  saying 9-11's an inside job and thousands of police and military and
[36:46.680 --> 36:50.640]  firefighters are going by and they're going we appreciate you Alex yes sir we
[36:50.640 --> 36:55.560]  know good job good job like you don't talk on camera no no just I mean it was
[36:55.560 --> 37:00.000]  like the head honchos we're out there firemen and police you know the guys
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.560]  the the commanders were Alex we appreciate you
[37:06.080 --> 37:10.840]  and then but again those were people who were there officially because they
[37:10.840 --> 37:15.320]  were people that responded that day I could go around the corner and protest
[37:15.320 --> 37:18.960]  and have you know you port authority cops come over and get in our face and
[37:18.960 --> 37:27.880]  act like gangster thugs but I mean I've interviewed the police officers on this
[37:27.880 --> 37:33.160]  show who were there and heard the countdown to blow up building 7 but I
[37:33.160 --> 37:35.880]  don't need to have them on as a guest I heard it on the radio they're gonna
[37:35.880 --> 37:39.880]  blow up building 7 we've played the clips they're gonna blow up building 7
[37:39.880 --> 37:46.000]  police saying get back they're blowing it up again are my lying eyes lying no
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  they're not so why won't the the firemen and police and medical people the real
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.680]  heroes of 9-11 who did respond many of which died many of which were injured
[37:56.680 --> 38:00.400]  why can't they be there because they can't be trusted ladies and gentlemen
[38:00.400 --> 38:05.440]  they know they were lied to about the dust the asbestos their treatment was
[38:05.440 --> 38:12.600]  blocked now they've got to be put through a terrorist database firemen and
[38:12.600 --> 38:18.320]  police officers that I've interviewed on this show get men in suits showing up
[38:18.320 --> 38:24.280]  at their house threatening them they get set up they get robbed they get beat
[38:24.280 --> 38:32.200]  up do you know how much surveillance they're under they know about the bombs
[38:32.200 --> 38:40.680]  they know about the molten metal they're not allowed in there in fact I want to
[38:40.680 --> 38:44.560]  tell my producers now I want to go back over and see who Luke recommends because
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.080]  he keeps a tally and knows all these great men and women we need to like as
[38:49.080 --> 38:53.920]  we lead up to 9-11 not only a week and a half away at tragic event 10 years later
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.360]  we need to go back over all those police officers firefighters emergency
[38:58.360 --> 39:03.320]  responders military people who we've had on who saw the bombs going off heard
[39:03.320 --> 39:09.080]  the bombs heard the Fed say we're gonna blow up building 7 we need to get them
[39:09.080 --> 39:13.160]  on the show a lot of them we've gotten on and then I call back a year later and

[39:32.140 --> 39:37.480]  legs cut off and stuff I mean I've interviewed these people and you're on
[39:37.480 --> 39:41.920]  the phone with them and they're under surveillance and harassment because I
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.560]  mean this is what goes on in America people say well then why are you alive
[39:46.560 --> 39:53.800]  they'll take over Libya they'll kill their former asset Saddam they will
[39:53.800 --> 39:59.680]  kill JFK Martin Luther King Robert Kennedy why aren't you dead and believe
[39:59.680 --> 40:03.920]  me I asked that question a lot and at the end of the day I think it's people
[40:03.920 --> 40:09.920]  praying for me I know it is and it's also from the establishment's position
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.000]  they don't want to underline highlight put 10 exclamation points behind
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.600]  everything I've said and done you know I've been doing this for 16 plus years
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.680]  and came from total obscurity and have had a slow burn and now reach millions
[40:26.680 --> 40:31.880]  and millions of people every day and I think they've made the calculation that
[40:31.880 --> 40:36.200]  if they kill me it could turn me into a martyr and they've tried to set me up
[40:36.200 --> 40:40.720]  and they've tried to throw the women at me and they've tried to infiltrate my
[40:40.720 --> 40:45.040]  office and they've they've sent cops up and you know hey let's do something violent
[40:45.040 --> 40:52.480]  I mean I've been through all that and by the grace of God I'm still here but it
[40:52.480 --> 40:58.360]  is creepy and and it's sad because if we had a real free market and a fairer
[40:58.360 --> 41:03.640]  system where we strive for innovation where we strive against corruption where
[41:03.640 --> 41:07.440]  we strive to have an open and free and healthy society where goodness is
[41:07.440 --> 41:12.400]  honored we have a much better world that way doesn't mean it's perfect but we
[41:12.400 --> 41:17.840]  strive towards that instead the corruption so bad a lot of people just
[41:17.840 --> 41:22.000]  have the attitude of just it there's nothing you can do just let it you know
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.720]  let it run wild well when you have that attitude nothing is held back and you
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.880]  get an absolute race to the bottom I mean I was thinking this morning about
[41:34.880 --> 41:40.760]  everything our so-called government does to destroy this country tax incentives
[41:40.760 --> 41:45.320]  to move overseas bail out money to the auto industry to move to South America
[41:45.320 --> 41:51.040]  China and Eastern Europe billion plus dollars per fact paying to move it I
[41:51.040 --> 41:59.600]  mean that is so over the top it's so over the top to say no first responders
[41:59.600 --> 42:04.040]  are allowed at ground zero I mean it's gigantic you could fit 50,000 people in
[42:04.040 --> 42:09.240]  there they bring thousands of them in every year the problem is is that I've
[42:09.240 --> 42:13.120]  been there and I've been invited in by the way by first responders who were
[42:13.120 --> 42:17.240]  allowed to bring a few friends and I've said no there's in one case my six cents
[42:17.240 --> 42:21.760]  said don't do it it might be a setup but I've seen the video shot by Luke and
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.200]  others who've gotten in because they're with victims family members and others
[42:25.200 --> 42:30.800]  and it is politicians get their arms grabbed going I know you blew it up you
[42:30.800 --> 42:35.200]  know we know it's an inside job and firemen saying we know what you did I
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.000]  mean they are scared of the cops and the firefighters and they should be the
[42:40.000 --> 42:43.840]  firefighters know all about fire they know those buildings were blown up they
[42:43.840 --> 42:48.800]  were all told they were blown up that day for five weeks there was molten lava
[42:48.800 --> 42:54.960]  under the buildings from jet fuel that doesn't burn half that hot they use
[42:54.960 --> 43:07.040]  super weapons on that baby and I wish every day this wasn't true this is not
[43:07.040 --> 43:11.960]  fun I didn't ever imagine I would get in this position in the fight against
[43:11.960 --> 43:15.960]  tyranny I was just gonna be a guy on access TV and they called up and said
[43:15.960 --> 43:19.800]  hey you want a local radio show you're good on access TV and then here I am all
[43:19.800 --> 43:24.640]  these years later and I have this incredible responsibility and I wish it
[43:24.640 --> 43:29.960]  wasn't true I wish I could lie to myself and and and say this wasn't real but
[43:29.960 --> 43:37.000]  don't you understand folks we don't have any future I mean if I would have sold
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.360]  out a decade ago and seven years ago when I got big establishment offers oh
[43:42.360 --> 43:48.240]  you'll end up having a TV show book deals everything else I don't even call
[43:48.240 --> 43:55.200]  when big publishers call now offering me national book deals I don't even have
[43:55.200 --> 44:02.160]  enjoyment when famous people call me up anymore there's no ego there's no there's
[44:02.160 --> 44:09.240]  no oh it's fun to be a radio talk show host it's all now just the duty to to
[44:09.240 --> 44:14.840]  research this horrible stuff and then to present it to you I mean it's like you're
[44:14.840 --> 44:17.600]  driving by and you see a horrible car wreck and see people getting thrown out
[44:17.600 --> 44:22.720]  of the car and it's not fun it's your duty to pull over and render a maid and
[44:22.720 --> 44:26.040]  you walk over and the woman's got her neck chopped open and blood squirting
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.720]  out and another guy's got his nose torn off and they're begging for help and you
[44:30.720 --> 44:34.400]  know you put pressure on their neck for them
[44:35.440 --> 44:40.560]  I'll ever forget the two really bad car wrecks I saw where I help people the
[44:40.560 --> 44:45.040]  smell of blood and the smell of fear and humanity dragging itself along the
[44:45.040 --> 44:50.860]  ground I'm so sad when I look at the public and see how weak they are how
[44:50.860 --> 44:55.560]  weak their eyes are how soulless they become and I know they're being poisoned
[44:55.560 --> 44:59.480]  I know that's why I can't even get mad at them and say look idiot wake up
[44:59.480 --> 45:03.120]  because they're they were set in front of a television from birth and they were
[45:03.120 --> 45:08.160]  drugged and poisoned the whole time and they're like zombies who just giggle at
[45:08.160 --> 45:11.920]  you they've been chemically lobotomized they're like people in a mental
[45:11.920 --> 45:16.720]  institution and they look at someone who is hyper aware hyper involved hyper
[45:16.720 --> 45:21.200]  researched and they see me as the bad man and I know why they see me as the
[45:21.200 --> 45:28.240]  bad man I understand it it's so over the top to use al-qaeda to kick out
[45:28.240 --> 45:35.320]  qaddafi it's so over the top to take the veteran's death benefits and now
[45:35.320 --> 45:38.440]  announced they're going to cut half their pensions they'll get the other half
[45:38.440 --> 45:43.680]  to it's so over the top to have Obama legalize all the illegals that we're
[45:43.680 --> 45:47.760]  about to be deported and say that's it you're all legal from now on it's so
[45:47.760 --> 45:52.920]  hardcore to give 16 trillion and then 1.5 trillion another 8 trillion other
[45:52.920 --> 45:58.920]  4 trillion to foreign banks and US newspapers and Rachel Maddow and MSNBC
[45:58.920 --> 46:08.200]  direct taxpayer money I mean that is so hardcore it is so hardcore to
[46:08.200 --> 46:11.680]  know that they gave over a hundred million Americans knowingly this is
[46:11.680 --> 46:15.320]  declassified US government you can pull up US government admits over a hundred
[46:15.320 --> 46:21.200]  million Americans got cancer from polio vaccine and then the reports they just
[46:21.200 --> 46:25.240]  talk about it like they're talking about the price of tires or something or you
[46:25.240 --> 46:29.200]  know something in the green sheets it's like well yes over a hundred million did
[46:29.200 --> 46:35.880]  get cancers and died from it hmm and then you got to some CBC TV piece where
[46:35.880 --> 46:40.000]  they interview the you know the the vaccine doctor who developed it and he
[46:40.000 --> 46:49.760]  just goes yeah millions died your mama your daddy I mean they killed them
[46:49.760 --> 46:54.720]  they're killing us and it's funny it's cute it's it's it's it's like their
[46:54.720 --> 47:00.640]  ego they they get off on spiking the factor 8 with HIV and hepatitis knowingly
[47:00.640 --> 47:05.960]  and chipping it out they these UN doctors get off on giving African kids
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.520]  vaccines that sterilize them and brain damage them and give them HIV and it's
[47:10.520 --> 47:16.840]  just it's just fun and it just goes on and on and on and on evil upon evil
[47:16.840 --> 47:24.200]  upon evil and I know why they haven't killed me yet they don't want to spook
[47:24.200 --> 47:31.200]  people they are poisoning and killing and microwaving us with the cell phones
[47:31.200 --> 47:37.680]  and spiking the water with uranium and radium and everything else and they are
[47:37.680 --> 47:43.640]  just enjoying themselves this is like a long 50 course meal that never ends for
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.800]  these psychopaths and it's so beautiful for them it's so it feels so good to know
[47:48.800 --> 47:53.080]  how many children are throwing up and dying under chemotherapy right now where
[47:53.080 --> 47:56.320]  their hair falling out and the light going out of their eyes it's so
[47:56.320 --> 48:02.000]  wonderful for them and so beautiful to them that that and they don't want to
[48:02.000 --> 48:10.600]  spook anybody it's like I'm a little spike buck coming out in the edge of the
[48:10.600 --> 48:17.880]  field following the dough I'm a yearling and I'm coming out with my little
[48:17.880 --> 48:22.800]  horns my little antlers and they've got me right there on their sites and they
[48:22.800 --> 48:29.360]  go no no don't spook anybody you kill him that'll only give him credibility this
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.640]  guy's too on target let him go on to the feeder and then go on in the woods
[48:34.640 --> 48:40.400]  because I know there's a big 20-point there's a big wall hanger because I've
[48:40.400 --> 48:44.320]  checked where he's rubbing over there I've checked where he's bedding down he's

[50:04.040 --> 50:10.280]  feel like you're on the winning team I'm talking about corporate chiefs
[50:10.280 --> 50:17.800]  bureaucrats assassination teams special forces police all of you you need to
[50:17.800 --> 50:24.080]  understand you didn't sign on like Enos or Roscoe Pico train to boss hogs

[50:36.240 --> 50:40.480]  this might as well be it it's it's as evil as you can imagine and more you've

[51:09.000 --> 51:16.320]  40 pounds I lost 55 pounds I went from a size 14 to a size 8 their secret is
[51:16.320 --> 51:21.240]  amber in the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones
[51:21.240 --> 51:25.920]  naturally the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance

[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:38.520]  trepidate the earthquake yesterday the economy reports of millions of unseen
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:44.680]  species fill the earth we're gonna be breaking all of that down coming up but
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.400]  right now Danny in Arkansas thanks for holding her on the air hey alex I was
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.720]  just wondering if you know about the executive order that bush signed back
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:59.800]  September 23rd of 2001 the executive order 13224 you're talking about how
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:06.320]  the first responders at 9-11 had to get go to the Patriot database to get
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.920]  medical care well since that executive order was signed anybody who buys or
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.680]  sells property or gets a mortgage in the United States has to go to the Patriot
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.160]  database well that's right the Patriot Act system and when you rent a car they
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.480]  run it through it everybody's turned into a little indentured servant Stasi
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.720]  agent and it's really know your customer but then Wachovian Wells Fargo can
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.880]  launder 376 million and they don't get in trouble it's it's it's a complete
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:42.800]  joke well that's a good point that you raise but they're now running again the
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.400]  first responders through the Patriot Act terror database before they can get
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.720]  healthcare but then Al Qaeda is being handed to Tripoli what do you think of
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:58.520]  that I think it's just par for the course for for what they're wanting to do to
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:02.920]  the rest of America and the entire world do you agree with me that that it's
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:07.840]  horrifying to think what are they gonna do next super congresses amnesties
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.520]  carbon taxes yeah you're gonna have rolling blackouts and increased power
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.360]  prices yeah we don't need laws who needs state I mean do you agree that more and
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.320]  more this is a dictatorship absolutely it's been a dictatorship for quite a
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.240]  while since they got rid of JFK we've been under a dictatorship you know I
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.800]  think you're right and now they're just really coming out in the open with it
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.880]  because they're getting us ready for the total depression yep thanks Alex you
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:40.880]  keep up the good work thank you Danny I'll try it's so creepy there's been a
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.280]  quasi dictatorship since Kennedy was killed but now they're really putting it
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.560]  in place it's kind of like they had the car started before but now they've got
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:55.880]  it rolling down the street and they're picking up speed let's talk to Tony in
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.840]  Washington then Allen and Denmark and others go ahead Tony hey Alex thanks for
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.680]  what you're doing this first sergeant and I'm preparing my retirement papers
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.600]  right now otherwise it wouldn't be calling you I got a call to China the
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.600]  guy on the carpet okay number one is there's a lot of us who would like to
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.640]  have a published list a published list of deliver against some others number two
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:27.120]  the Chenevik the reason why he's clamoring to talk about all this is
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.680]  because he's one of the ones who devised all these plans that are being
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:37.600]  utilized on us and he's very well aware of that he's just a weird animal it's
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:43.640]  like you got to have him but you got to hate him too and going back we have
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.920]  published this year and then several years back the Bilderberg attending
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.680]  list at first was leaked to the media and then it always gets leaked so then
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.680]  they get mad and then publish it on their own website and then they run a
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.280]  psyop saying look we published it don't say it was secret but but no going back
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:07.400]  about a decade ago people would leak it from inside to Jim Tucker then they would
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.360]  get mad started setting up their own website so Bilderberg has a website and
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.240]  you can now read the attendee list we've again a decade or so ago it didn't
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:22.200]  exist now they admit it exists but just keep it secret well yeah I understand
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.880]  that it's just the list is always expanding it'd be nice to put a little
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:32.240]  more spotlight personally on these people the other thing is if he is such a
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.320]  patriot and believe me I know some of the people that are in them in that whole
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.520]  system you know soft-target long-distance acquisition I'm very familiar okay
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.600]  then if he's such a patriot he has all these colleagues and how come we aren't
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.840]  taking care of business here
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:55.440]  well look I'm a news broadcast and I mean I think to ask somebody why they're
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.920]  not taking out corrupt people I'm gonna break that down when we come back

[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:33.800]  day of August 2011 coming up at the bottom of the hour I am gonna blitz
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.560]  through a bunch of news we've also got some other breaking news on the economy
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:42.160]  we're going to be following I want to go to Allen and Denmark Seth in California
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.480]  Bill and many others here in just a moment but we had a caller in the last
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:52.080]  segment if you missed it who said hey if somebody like Dr. Steve Pachinic who was
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.320]  in black ops all over the world and wrote psychological warfare manuals for
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.920]  the State Department if he's saying our government's so bad why aren't you know
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.840]  people like Pachinic dealing with problems here at home this is a news
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:10.360]  broadcast I don't get into talk about taking this person out or taking that
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:18.080]  person out this is a corrupt system and I liken it to shark teeth if all of the
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.920]  leadership of the New World Order disappeared and was put on a deserted
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:28.600]  island right now or liken Superman were you know put into a pane of glass and
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:36.760]  ejected into deep space from the planet Krypton it is our individual laziness
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.360]  and our individual corruption to not be involved to not be informed that we would
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:49.320]  instantly end up in it just as bad a position perhaps even worse see the
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.840]  globalists are able to run things because they don't care if things get
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:58.520]  worse fact they like it as long as they control the resources and the police they
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:04.000]  love the new civil war that's gonna last years even the State Department even
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.120]  the British Foreign Service is saying yeah this is gonna last years they might
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.160]  could have killed Gaddafi today or tomorrow but this is gonna go on for
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:15.760]  years that's good an industrialized country the hub of Africa destroyed
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:22.200]  Western forces just guard the oil fields and the refineries and shut down
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.440]  that waterway they had to get water to Africa you're not gonna get that stuff
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:31.120]  for free you're gonna pay and and that makes all of their assets go up in
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:37.960]  value when you burn down somebody's country from the globalist perspective
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:42.720]  that makes your value go up then you come in and loan them fiat money why do
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.320]  they accept your fiat money because you got a military backing it up because you
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.760]  bought that military in that country with your Ponzi scheme see real Ponzi
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.440]  scheme operators don't go to prison like Madoff they take over they rule they
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.400]  lecture us on we shouldn't be able to have you know take a shower or have
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.920]  more than one change of clothes for the earth but then they're living in 25
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:12.000]  palaces and giant yachts the size of destroyers and dozens of you know wide
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:19.600]  body aircraft and 567 kids while lecturing us and they didn't make their
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.560]  money through free market they stole every stinking sin of it and shut their
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.720]  competition down and now they want everything they don't want you growing
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.360]  your own crops and selling it to your neighbor producing your own eggs and
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.440]  selling it we're having lemonade stands that's all over the whole police state
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:45.840]  apparatus is here to revenue generate and to shut down the underground economy
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.880]  that's the essence of an occupied country when you're living in an occupied
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:57.360]  nation when you're living in the most occupied type of country you aren't
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:04.000]  allowed to do deadly squad we have to have an awakening to the culture of
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.840]  liberty rediscover it and then just stop complying and we have to support
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:12.480]  candidates who will run who will educate people even if they don't win the
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.200]  first three or four times we have to expose the electronic voting machines
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.200]  we have to defend the second amendment we have to expose the globalist because
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:26.080]  if they can blame puppets you know they love the fact that Obama has the lowest
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.680]  approval rating in history of any president two and a half years into an
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:36.640]  administration and Obama is meant to go sit there at Martha's Vineyard and
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:43.880]  enrage everyone he's meant like a shield to take all the hits and when the
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.880]  globalists are done they're gonna throw him down and pick up another puppet a
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:59.360]  Sarah Palin a Mitt Romney a Rick Perry that's why they love all the other little
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.200]  shills because they're just armor they're just a distraction they're just a
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.400]  front for the new world order that's why they ignore or if they're forced to talk
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:15.760]  about him demonize Ron Paul and talk to you like you've got a IQ below room
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.200]  temperature and say he cannot win but wait he keeps winning most the polls
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:27.400]  shut up we said we told you and people less and less buy into that when they
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.120]  talk to you like you're two years old you're like you know what I'm not two
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.360]  years old I see what you're doing and they're like really maybe we need to
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.600]  just shut down the alternative media maybe UT party people are terrorists hmm
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:45.400]  you see this homeland security system shut up and do what we say give us your
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:51.600]  pension funds or we might have to arrest you for terrorism and they openly
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.200]  smile and put out White House memos saying how great terror attacks would be
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:03.040]  they mean to be out in the open now and come within one micron of admitting
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.200]  their staging terror they don't care if you know Al Qaeda is you globalist run
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.600]  and being given Libya they don't care if you know the first responders are
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.840]  barred from the 10th anniversary they don't care if you know they're openly
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.920]  getting ready to take at least half the pension funds of the military that
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:24.200]  they're announcing it how great it is they don't care you get they like it
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.400]  they're offshore in armored fortresses they want you to blow stuff up and run
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.440]  around crazy and start killing cops that's the terrorism they're talking
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.920]  about they they have like throwing two Chinese fighting fish in a tank and
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:45.320]  watching them kill each other they sit there and play these games with us the
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:52.120]  globalist are a third party sitting back all right I'm gonna shut up but
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:58.200]  there's your answer look I'm only for violence in defense and I will defend
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:09.440]  myself and I hope it doesn't come to that because I don't want to play along
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.920]  with their game I'd rather police and military grow up study a little bit of
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.640]  history and look at what's happening in this country and really really join
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.920]  humanity but you know they're not the bad ones it's it's the corporate whores
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:29.800]  it's the politicians it's all these oily mile-wide inch deep all had no
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:36.200]  cattle type people who are completely shallow completely worldly and just
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:40.360]  prance around from party to party and enjoy being given awards and enjoy
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:46.400]  golfing with their buddies and acting tough and they they are just they are
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:53.280]  the end result of a decadent society they're that scum that rises up right
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:16:02.000]  before all the fish in the pond die and there are the first that are going to
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.320]  run around like a chicken with their head cut off when when when their world
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:19.160]  ends you know at least mercenaries and police have to live in the dirt and see
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.960]  the crime and see what's happening to humanity and have to live in the real
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:28.480]  world these these bureaucrats and these politicians these whores they just sit
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.200]  up there in their little ivory towers all day playing with our lives like it's
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:37.040]  their little toy to use the words of Bob Dylan and I'm tired of it I want my
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.240]  freedom jack and I want it right now and I want you out of my life I want you to
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:48.080]  stop sucking off me I'm gonna do my best to identify who did all this and let the
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:53.840]  people do the rest because if they can't divert us with Obama or the fake
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.680]  Republicans if they can't make us think that those little puppets are actually
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.840]  the people running it then they're gonna get the blame the people that deserve
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:08.160]  to get the blame can't can't operate if they get the blame they've got a run
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.680]  under stealth with their little front men and their little operatives out there
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:19.000]  or their power is over Wizard of Oz it's an analogy a book a play written
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.160]  during currency manipulations

[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.600]  they want you to think homeland security is the big scary face it's meant to scare
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.880]  thinking people it's a message to those that can think yeah we're a tyranny
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:51.560]  better shut up but for the dumb down it's a message to them to just accept it
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:57.240]  they're like a they're like a trained trained domesticated cow that just
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:04.440]  walks right into the slaughterhouse there's a giant meat grinder and the

[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:27.920]  news I know I've been preaching a lot today I I just I don't know if the
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:36.160]  general public realizes what going into hardcore tyranny is like yeah there's the
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.160]  headline cops confiscate cameras at Ohio congressman's town hall curtain
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:46.880]  emo just amazing it's just everywhere they're just they're just going after
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:54.400]  everybody's basic liberties public events grabbing cameras man why don't the
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:25:01.120]  police say no more I guess they did out in court site they all got fired
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:09.000]  all right let's just go to your calls Alan and Denmark and then Seth Sean
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.200]  Bill Marcus and others go ahead Alan welcome hello please don't call me that
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:23.480]  what's on your mind today sir why not you are our conquer but my point is I
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:30.600]  would like to talk about Greenland in 2008 Greenland became independent that
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:36.840]  would be like if Hawaii became independent but my point is why do you
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:42.600]  think that the world all has plans for oil like in Alaska or is it about the
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:48.960]  tool base or what do you think well a lot of times when countries are quote
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.400]  given their independence it's really just because they're being handed over
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:57.320]  directly to a corporate interest and I don't know enough about that with
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:03.280]  Greenland but I am aware of it and there there is reportedly going to be some
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:10.480]  expanded exploration into Alaska and other areas because the cartel cannot
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:15.760]  have a pure monopoly because Russia isn't playing ball and is exploring a
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.880]  lot of oil in their country and so as you know Scotland some of the other
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:26.680]  Scandinavian countries east of there are going ahead and developing those
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:32.760]  different operations and that's a good thing or we would really see higher
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.000]  power prices from what we see now but the globalists are trying their best to
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.640]  shut down as much exploration as they can
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:49.120]  okay but it's just because of the tool base that has been built in 1951 and now
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:54.040]  it's part of the Air Force base command I was just wondering if they're gonna
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:01.680]  expand the underground bases all but if you don't know then I do not know but I
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.280]  know there's underground bases all over the place there's one out here in
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:08.480]  Berkstrom under the Hilton Hotel it used to be the sat command base it's
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:16.480]  connected to railways all over the United States okay so you don't know I do not
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:21.400]  know specifically if you send me some information on that Alan I'll try to
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:26.320]  dig it up for you thank you so much okay let's go ahead and talk to Seth in
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.560]  California you're on the air welcome hey what's happening Alex how you doing

[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.900]  everyone I talked he wants to vote for him unfortunately the people watching
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:53.480]  TV don't think he can win so I just keep putting the message out there well
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.680]  you've got to love it how the media always says well he wins all these online
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:02.080]  polls even scientific ones but the internet's not the real world well no
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:05.920]  it just so happens to be statistically a higher educated more informed
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:09.720]  population that's well known not just in any marketing study you look at but
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:15.920]  now he's winning first second or third place in every scientific poll most of
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.160]  them second place some first place a few third place he's winning most the
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:26.000]  straw polls are coming in statistical ties with Bachman and they just keep
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.160]  parroting he can't win in fact I have an article here today Gallup has another
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:36.840]  one out Ron Paul now polls almost at dead heat with Obama outstripping the
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:41.840]  other Republican candidates I mean Ron Paul is dominating he is if you had to
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:48.880]  pick one person you had to pick one person who is the real front runner it's
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.520]  Ron Paul and then when they do analysis of him against Obama he does the best
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.920]  because there are some liberals who are really progressives who do really want to
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.960]  end war and end torture and who do want states rights and who do want freedom
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:06.520]  you know Thomas Jefferson was a liberal these names all change you can call me a
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:11.840]  paleo-conservative a classical liberal you know to be a liberal today is not
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.120]  really liberal to be a mainline conservative is to be like some kind of
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:21.680]  Nazi warmongering lying torture loving gibbering idiots so all these terms
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:27.680]  mean nothing Ron Paul can absolutely dominate anything else there Seth are
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.760]  you know I think that's about it man thanks for all you do I like you rock
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:36.120]  no I'm listen we're all in this together man I appreciate everybody
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:40.560]  thanking me but I would be insane to know what I know and not fight these
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.320]  people they're not given his quarter they don't want to domesticate us they
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:50.240]  want to kill us okay we'll be right back with more calls stay with us

[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.600]  info warriors to call all the mainstream media networks complaining that we want
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:14.880]  Ron Paul coverage fight the wrong Paul media blackout Alex and my hero thank
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:18.320]  you well thank you boy you can tell there's a lot of Ron Paul support out
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.440]  there especially on this show let's talk to bill in New Mexico bill you're on the
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:29.160]  air hi Alex it's bill I'm here in New Mexico and I found out about five or six
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:35.960]  years ago that there's a place called the Los Lunes Decalogue and this Los
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.400]  Lunes Decalogue is a the only place they found the Tank Commandments written in
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.920]  the script of Moses and that's fine all Wikipedia has their little thing nothing
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:50.440]  to see here but what's actually located there is an Israelite tabernacle site
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:58.880]  that dates to a solar club since 759 BC actually September 27th 759 BC and this
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:04.040]  all goes to like four years of research right up until I found out about you and
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:09.720]  your offshore cartels what I was researching was this false god idea why
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.640]  was it just idols that they were worshiping and it turned out that it
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:18.160]  wasn't they actually had priests who packed and shipped all the goods of
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:24.840]  Venetians so these were corporations of their age well I know that the New
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.720]  World Order law is the trade law of the Venetians I know about that the other
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.720]  stuff kind of confuses me but I mean I know that a lot of the globalists are
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:38.240]  into the occult a lot of politicians are obsessed with numerology and are very
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:42.920]  superstitious I mean that's been confirmed in every age and every society
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:50.080]  for whatever reason yes and none of them are actually toting this mountain no
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.800]  and totes this mountain matter fact itself sits barren with the only place on
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.960]  earth that the Ten Commandments is written in stone and it's written there
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:04.040]  but like a hundred years report to our law before the Exodus of Babylon so well
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:09.120]  I didn't know that the Ten Commandments were carved in stone pre pre Moses
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:18.600]  after Moses all right well send me some information because again I'm not saying
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:26.120]  it's an awful wall issue I understand some of it but again I'm not I'm not the
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.880]  omnipresent here that is aware of everything please send me some
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:36.440]  information on that guys start getting the video ready of this this article
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:45.040]  congressman has cops confiscate cameras I want to get that video ready again the
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:51.160]  headline is cops confiscate cameras at Ohio congressman's town hall Roger Roger
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:57.960]  on that fantastic okay I'm gonna get to the news here in a moment but let's
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:02.440]  continue with your phone calls let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Tennessee
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:07.680]  welcome hey Alex how you doing good hey I just wanted to point out two things
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:11.080]  real quick I said this fact to my cousin about three years ago I never thought
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:16.000]  that obama and his little plan there was ever gonna lay his power down I think
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.800]  the reason they're poking is they're hoping that will rebel so it gives them
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:22.720]  excuse to go ahead and bring in full power and I think that a prom plexi gets
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:26.400]  close to getting the nomination I think that they may actually instigate
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:30.080]  something to go ahead and control us or to go ahead and take full dictatorship
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:36.640]  do you agree with that absolutely I I think Sean what you're saying has a lot
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:42.040]  of truth to it everything the system's doing now is trying to outrage people
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.200]  trying to make people angry and I remember three years ago getting the
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:51.000]  Mayak and homeland security reports where they were they're teaching police the
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.640]  number one threat is returning veterans that the veterans are evil and that they
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.680]  support the Constitution and actually you know says they talk about the
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.920]  Constitution their pro-second amendment and they're the number one terror threat
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:10.040]  and they taught police in in in every city veterans will attack you it's not a
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:16.040]  question of if but when the veterans are going to kill you and I'm like man that
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:22.120]  is bold to to switch from al-qaeda to the veterans and it's bold to actually use
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:26.080]  al-qaeda against Qaddafi and it's bold to bar the first responders from the
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:29.760]  tenth anniversary and if you're a new listener I know that sounds like a lie
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:35.240]  Fox News AP CNN again I was on a syndicated show this morning and they
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:40.280]  didn't believe me at first and I don't blame them I when I saw this on Monday I
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:46.280]  saw we had a link to CNN on info wars comm and I clicked it and I was like am
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:50.000]  I reading that so then I went to the government press release about it and
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:57.120]  and this is what tyrants do I mean they just get crazier and crazier and crazier
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.240]  but they're crazy like a fox they're trying to break our will for the general
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:08.480]  public but also make a lot of people go over the edge and then they won't have
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:15.080]  to provocateur I mean I can't tell you folks how many 75 year old veterans
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.680]  there are who serve 25 years you know 23 years in the army or whatever and and
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:27.560]  they they take their pension away they're gonna get angry and then when
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:32.840]  their house is getting repossessed and the sheriff comes with the deputies to
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:37.480]  take their home it is not gonna be pretty how about the sheriff just doesn't
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:44.520]  take the house how about we say you know what give us the 28 trillion back or
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:48.560]  27 trillion back we've given you foreign banks that more than paced for all the
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:54.800]  liquid mortgages seven times over paced for all the mortgages in the US almost
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.000]  twice not just a liquid but all of them how about you just give us our tax
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.800]  money back and then we'll talk about taking grandpa's house so so you've
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:09.120]  absolutely hit on something here Sean bring up one more thing of course go
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.400]  ahead I was actually law enforcement for right at ten years I've been out of
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.000]  about six years and you touch on that a lot I just want to kind of give you a
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.720]  little bit I'm no expert but a little bit of an insight on how they get they
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.800]  think it's like anything I think that when you get anything with power or
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.920]  anything with control like that it's easy to get compartmentalized and I
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:34.000]  adulterous in it something I even had to wrestle with my first two years and you
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.480]  have the power to seize people's movement and take control of them that's a
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:43.200]  lot of power whether they think about it or not and I think that's easy to get
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.000]  locked into that and it becomes kind of cultic and where they protect each other
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.480]  it's just kind of like a I don't know I won't say boys club but it's just very
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:59.000]  adulterous no it's the largest street gang on earth there's a lot of great
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  guys in it though don't get me wrong there are a lot of great guys but just a
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.600]  few that are in it that make it horrible for everybody else because they're so
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:11.080]  visual that it over it's just overbearing to the guys that are in it
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.480]  because they actually care and you'll find a lot of guys are in it because they
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.840]  care sure getting out of it well what's happening is is that there there's
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.200]  mob psychology in any group I've caught myself leading a demonstration or at a
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.400]  demonstration and I actually go wild and that's the same thing that happens with
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.320]  police in a group where they just attack peaceful demonstrators because we are we
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:37.560]  have that animal side to us like a bunch of wolves and that's why even the best
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.760]  militaries get out of control that's why George Washington you know would hang
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.600]  someone for looting the British it was just oh go do it and bring me part of
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.400]  the loot George Washington was marveled at around the world that who he
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:54.480]  actually hangs people if they loot because he knew that if he let it get
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.760]  out of control he even wrote that they would lose the hearts and minds of the
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:02.960]  people it wasn't just that he was extremely moral and upstanding he knew
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:07.960]  they had to be absolutely upright and that the British were engaging in looting
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.080]  and atrocities that that was helping the cause of liberty and so the larger
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:17.440]  problem with police from studying it studying criminology and history is that
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:20.880]  they've now even if you have good leadership you're gonna have problems
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:26.720]  when you get corrupt politicians in control of police departments you become
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.960]  a third-world country anything else yeah I was gonna one more thing a bully
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:37.320]  will smack you across the face as many times as we let them so if we don't
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:40.960]  stand up soon we're not gonna have another cheek to turn well how do you
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:44.240]  suggest we stand up then I'm just trying to wake people up I'm saying
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.960]  non-compliance expose the central banks it does look like they might indict the
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:53.840]  head of Goldman Sachs he's retained the Enron lawyers I mean they've committed
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.360]  the crimes I mean the ruling class that did all this that runs this are
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:02.680]  openly criminals so I mean how do we how do we stand up against them without
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:09.720]  being violent um yeah we're running out of room it's sad and I hope that never
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:14.560]  has to come to those kind of things but it would take so many people waking up
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:18.840]  so quickly to make such an upward that they would have to back down out of fear
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:23.040]  of the people not being violent necessarily but putting them in prison
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:28.800]  taking down their industries and their powers of power I mean it's just gonna
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:31.760]  take a lot of people waking up and I just promise you I hope that Ron Paul is
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:37.320]  able to wake enough people up in you and people like you and if we don't I don't
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:40.560]  know I hope it never comes to that but either that there's not gonna be a
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:47.680]  republic left well the the republic is cold and dead on the gurney we've been
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.960]  dead about five minutes politically we might be able to shock the heart back
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:58.760]  into motion but but we can always reinstate the republic you know it
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:03.840]  basically rises again because it's an idea and it lives in us my friend God
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:08.840]  bless you I appreciate your call Sean in Tennessee it's just every time I think
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:13.320]  about it I get chills I was jogging this morning it's like I'm a menopausal woman
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:21.000]  or something I mean my whole life I've had a bad feeling and every time it's
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.040]  right I get up and somebody's breaking in my car outside even though I didn't
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:30.160]  hear a noise or something tells me don't walk into the field house and then I
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.080]  go I'm gonna go ahead and walk in and then somebody's cousin you know who I
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:38.560]  got in a fight with you know blindsides me and breaks my nose and I'm like wow
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.320]  should have listened to that my whole life I have this this this this chill I
[01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:48.840]  get and I don't get it watching horror movies I don't get it now I only get the
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:54.960]  chill when when like deep down my body my soul is saying man this is and now I'm
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:01.160]  getting chills 50 times a day something bad's about to happen I'm telling you
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.920]  folks it's gonna be bad like nothing we've ever seen it could be suitcase
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:08.840]  nukes it could be anything but I'm telling you I'm getting chills all the
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:15.320]  time now chills chills chills chills chills chills chills chills chills and I
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.360]  might just be grief for this country but just watching the lawlessness of the
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:22.560]  government and knowing that they're getting away with it well they're gonna
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:27.240]  just do more see that's what happens with tyranny once it it's hard to get it
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:31.960]  rolling but once it starts rolling it's hard to stop in fact it just starts
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:36.240]  speeding up and I'd say tyranny's going about 100 miles an hour right now and
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.880]  this thing can go about 10,000 miles an hour and it just starts going faster and
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:45.880]  faster and faster and faster and
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:53.600]  you know I talk about the chill it's like more than an adrenaline rush have
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.400]  you ever seen a child walk out into a busy street and you see a big truck
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.560]  coming I know I've seen this a couple times we've all seen it in movies and
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:02.360]  have that same feeling but have you ever been in a parking lot and have your
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.360]  toddler run out behind you and a car is going 10 miles an hour and you have that
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:11.680]  feeling not even of not even of adrenaline but but more of just like you
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:19.840]  get chills like my whole world is about to be run over and and and it's a
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:25.400]  feeling of wanting at my deepest level and I know you want this as well to have
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:34.680]  things get better to turn it back to just just just reverse the evil but you
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:38.280]  know what I guess this is what has to happen every time I get really upset
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:45.720]  about this I realized that we lied to ourselves we let ourselves give into
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:51.240]  corruption all of us I mean at the time of Roe v. Wade around half the country
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:56.640]  thought that abortion was a good thing now it's about 30% so we're winning that
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:04.240]  moral fight it took time but 51 to 52 million babies are dead and people don't
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:07.120]  like it when I talk about abortion I had so many radio stations over the
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:10.240]  year say you talk about it one more time you're not gonna be on our radio
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:16.320]  station well you think I would be complicit in the death of children to be
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:25.200]  on the radio you think I would sell my soul out I'm not a good person ladies
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:30.400]  and gentlemen I'm not a bad person I know the point is I know I'm not perfect
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:36.040]  it's not special that I don't want to join with evil and that's why we're in
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.600]  so much trouble people are like oh Alex you have such courage to stand up against
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:49.120]  these people oh Alex you you know you what am I supposed to do this is self
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:56.960]  preservation ladies and gentlemen don't you understand you can't make a deal
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:03.160]  with evil you can't invite it into your house oh it's slick it knows how to
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:08.320]  smile at you it's got the sparkle in its eye like Rick Perry but at the end of the
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:18.000]  day it's a predator that enjoys conning people stop being willful chumps the
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.720]  tyranny is now blazing obvious and it's gonna get worse you think the tyranny
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:29.280]  looks scary now at 100 yards away because it's like it's a flaming dragon of
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:33.720]  evil wait till it starts getting close it starts burning your skin as it's
[01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:39.720]  coming at us I told you that light far off was a big flaming corruption coming
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:43.640]  our way people all know it's not now it's up close people are going oh that
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:59.920]  does what oh yeah exactly so once this stuff really goes hot once this stuff
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.120]  really triggers once this stuff kicks off and the Globalist Institute of Civil
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.200]  War in this country and terror attacks and bad lemon secret arrest and all the
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:15.280]  rest of stuff that comes with it there's not going to be putting a genie back in
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:20.560]  the bottle there's not going to be a turning it around okay we got to turn
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.320]  this around right now and then just what that former police officer just said
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:32.320]  they want it to get violent we have got to stop that from happening because they
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:35.720]  are going to use that to have a crackdown on this country against
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:40.160]  everybody and then it's going to get even more violent the globalists don't
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:48.040]  care they're sitting it out watching it they're not in the arena let's go to

[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:32.680]  they have the police confiscate the video cameras to quote protect the
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:37.240]  constituents a local TV station however was allowed to video take the meeting
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:52.400]  and the brazen move by Chabot and the cops Wow this is this is really crazy but I
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.200]  see this stuff all the time police chief stands up you're fired there no one's
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:02.560]  allowed to speak I rule I mean just bizarreness and people roll over to it
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:08.960]  and so they get more people ask what is tyranny it's just when you give in to
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:18.080]  corruption it runs wild so and I'm gonna stop ranting let's go to Vanessa in
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:28.400]  Idaho welcome Vanessa hey welcome hi long-time listener first-time caller
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:32.920]  here welcome I'm hoping my kids will be quiet so I can make my point here real
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:38.760]  quick Mike I woke up about three or four years ago and I was just really
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:45.440]  amazed at the correlation between what I was learning and what was foreseen by
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:48.520]  profits two thousand years ago in a book called the Book of Mormon have you
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:52.480]  heard of it well I have heard of the Book of Mormon and I think I've scanned
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:59.360]  through it once or twice but I mean I don't really generally have a religious
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:03.440]  style show because then it just turns into folks you know debating this view
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:07.560]  or that view even within Christianity you know there's lots of groups all
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:13.160]  saying that they're the one way to go I just have a personal relationship with
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:21.080]  Christ and so that's basically where I stand but give us your view and I know
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:25.520]  mainstream scholars and they try to discredit and ignore it but I'm just
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:31.640]  hoping I can just read a quick verse of scripture it's just a warning from a
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:36.640]  prophet named Maronai and just for people our day in this country and he says
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:40.800]  wherefore the Lord commanded you when you shall see these things come among you
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:44.400]  you shall awake to a sense of your awful situation because of this secret
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:47.880]  combination which shall be among you for it come with the past that who so
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:51.800]  build us it up seek us to overthrow the freedom of all lands nations countries
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:56.080]  and it brings it to pass the destruction of all people for it's built up at the
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:57:00.160]  devil who is the father of all lives yeah don't Mormons call that a
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:05.200]  conspiracies they call it a secret combination well that's what the people
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:08.880]  in the Book of Mormon their civilization was overthrown by a secret
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:13.960]  combination and their book is written to warn us that if we don't stand up in
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.280]  the wake that the same thing is going to happen and it's just full of these
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:20.640]  warnings it's there's a great video on YouTube called
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:26.040]  all situations secret combinations above us and it gives a lot of those well I
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:30.360]  know that you call them conspiracies call them secret combinations they
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:33.720]  certainly exist throughout history I appreciate your call good to hear from

[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:20.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:26.120]  Alex Jones okay I've had a smattering of some of the top news but I'm going
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:29.880]  through all of it coming up the next segment and back into your calls and
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:37.280]  we have a guest joining us to break down the Bankster criminal activity the
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:41.760]  Daily Beast asked could Blank Fine Face prison and I've also got mainstream
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:45.120]  articles saying that he's gotten the big criminal defense lawyer that
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:49.520]  represented in Ron and the word is that Lloyd Blank fine might actually get
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:55.360]  indicted now I would start having faith in America again it would be a good sign
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:59.120]  if this guy got indicted so I'm gonna tell you more about that coming up that
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:05.120]  is very exciting oh man that guy is such a crook okay I was talking to John in
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:11.520]  Australia and John was bringing up that when you don't watch Fox News or CNN
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:16.120]  often I mean I watched little clips people send me of key things like oh
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:22.920]  here's a clip from Meet the Press where Greenspan is saying we'll just print
[02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:26.320]  money we'll never default which is another way to default is to print money
[02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:30.640]  it's so ridiculous how dumb he thinks the public is and I guess they are dumb
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.200]  to a certain extent that he got away with it he did get laughed at by the
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:38.080]  host and the other globalists were like really smiling and holding back laughter
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:43.120]  but it was more embarrassed laughter but when you don't watch it regularly and
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:49.720]  you sit back and watch sitcoms dramas news there's even more propaganda and
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:57.880]  sitcoms and dramas when you sit back and watch it it is just laced with cartoon
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:02.200]  level propaganda I mean if I was gonna make a science fiction movie about a
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:07.000]  futuristic ridiculous absurdist police state you could pretty much just show
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:13.800]  them what's on TV now though I did actually watch some TV this weekend the
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:18.840]  science channel because I finally got a high-def television don't watch a lot of
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:22.080]  me we usually when I'm on the national news my wife wants to watch it or
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:25.600]  something we've got to spend an hour trying to hook it up but but but we've
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.680]  got we live in the country now so we have dished network and man they're high
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:33.520]  def channel I don't know how they're compressing it but on that TV it was like
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:39.040]  reaching into the screen on the science channel talking about the universe and
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:43.320]  how it was created and the graphics it was just amazing but so there is some
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:47.560]  good stuff on television it actually watched like three or four programs and
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:54.160]  wasn't brainwashed or or told how evil the Second Amendment was or anything so
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:59.680]  wow there is some hope but going back to John in Australia finish your point
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:04.320]  about that my friend yes point I was gonna make is I just want all your all
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:11.080]  your listeners today just to hear that you in the United States are living in
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:16.080]  an absolute media bubble you are basically spoon-fed what you are meant
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:20.360]  to hear and that's it in a nutshell and I got to tell you that people here in
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:24.440]  Australia are pretty wise to what's going on you know they're trying to pass
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:29.440]  this carbon tax to you carbon tax here and you know we see a little bit on
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.560]  the news but it's almost laughable you know people are asking well what do we
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:37.080]  need this for and just people know what's going on they've tried three
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:41.480]  separate times and it keeps bringing down the governments and then the next
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.640]  government does it because they've got orders even though it politically
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:48.560]  destroys them and the Aussies are starting to really get woken up and get
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:52.360]  angry and that's good news listen they were as soon as I first got here they're
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:57.000]  all asking me hey is 9-11 a conspiracy what do you think you know and I'm just
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.440]  like you know at that point I I you know my point I was well I don't I didn't
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:05.160]  have all the answers I don't know that any of us are gonna really have all the
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:10.640]  answers but you know it's kind of the old old adage of if it looks like a duck
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:16.520]  and it quacks like a duck well then it's probably a duck so and you know
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:21.800]  thankfully you're you know tuning everybody into to really what's going
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:26.280]  on all you gotta tell Aussies is this I've seen the numbers they're being blocked
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:32.000]  from having new coal power plants but China gets to have three a week now is
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:36.520]  that fair the coal power plants here you know they're trying to pass this
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:41.000]  this whole carbon tax and of course Australia has some of the dirtiest coal
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:48.360]  plants around they're inefficient yeah they need to just upgrade them all right
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:54.480]  I appreciate your call you know coal's not perfect but it is 51% of US power and
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:58.400]  you think our economy's in the toilet now these taxes go through which they
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:03.840]  up this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:08.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:12.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:16.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:20.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:24.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:28.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:33.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:36.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:40.960]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:44.360]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:36.200]  network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones level of corruption is
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:45.680]  nothing less than staggering we have seen the core leadership of the rebels
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.800]  admittedly being al-qaeda that has killed us troops the LA Times Reuters
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:57.520]  others have admitted it it's now admitted that for six months notice
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:01.520]  Obama said that he could launch the war with you and approval doesn't need any
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:07.200]  stinking Congress badges we don't need no stinking badges Congress we don't need
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:14.400]  no stinking Congress that they launched that attack six months ago that was in
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:20.240]  Reuters this morning that six months ago the West began aiding rebels the
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:24.920]  rebels hadn't even attacked yet six months ago they trained them it turns
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:31.280]  out NATO a year ago did drills of bombing different cities the West went
[02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:39.240]  in funded violent terrorist al-qaeda groups to attack Libya and to take the
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:44.960]  country and they've shipped arms into them from the beginning from before the
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:54.560]  start of conflict and now it is admitted in Reuters I was reading today and
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:03.600]  there it was in Reuters it said the six month campaign and that they'd been
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:08.800]  aiding them from the beginning for months and months they denied this even
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:14.280]  though it leaked out the foreign press I mean they just lie and lie and lie and
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:18.040]  then these rebel commanders are in the news shooting their mouths off about
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:24.080]  yes I have killed Americans and Iraq and I will kill more again but first I will
[02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:35.600]  kill Qaddafi what I mean I'm living in the twilight zone here and so Qaddafi
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:42.080]  42 years in power is now saying that he's going to fight on till the end he
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.680]  will either die as a martyr or be victorious against the dogs and devils
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:53.400]  to quote him that have taken over quote his country and the issue is he was
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:58.520]  clearly a benevolent dictator I don't like dictators I don't like centralized
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:02.120]  systems but every once in a while you get a guy who wants to build up the
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.320]  country and build up the continent and most the money actually was spent on the
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:12.040]  people and the bureaucracy was very very small and the women got tuition to go
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:17.200]  to college and everybody got thousands of dollars of stipend every year and
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:22.160]  automobiles and houses and apartment buildings built everywhere and the
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:26.640]  globalists looked at that and they said this ain't happening especially when
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:30.480]  Qaddafi went to the rest of Africa and said let's make our own currency let's
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:37.520]  create our own credit back currency really the American system and the
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.760]  banker said uh-huh and Qaddafi even tried to invest with the globalist he
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:45.800]  tried to make deals with him seven years ago and they went in and hired Al
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:50.720]  Qaeda to attack called him rebels called him protesters and have now taken
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:56.240]  Tripoli and Qaddafi's hiding in his underground labyrinth that he's built in
[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:03.880]  40-plus years of knowing that this time was coming and the civil war is now
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:08.800]  beginning and he's called on the different tribes they're loyal to him to
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:16.240]  fight incessantly and if you study the fascist when they went into Libya out of
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:22.960]  Italy under the leader of Italy at the time the dictator but he told Mussolini
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:29.560]  el duche or wherever you call him they fought him for a decade and if you look
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:35.080]  at the monarch the British installed constant fighting so you were told this
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:39.880]  was being done for humanitarian reasons that country is now going to descend
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:45.960]  back into the sand from which it came and good old boys seem to think that they
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:50.680]  get ahead by going glass parking lot them glass parking lot them they're just
[02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:55.720]  people like us that want a future and this does not send a very good message
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:13:00.040]  of the world that Qaddafi tried to quote work with the West and got double
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:06.640]  crossed and now they're gonna put Sharia law in that was reported yesterday so
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:11.680]  the women that thought they were gonna run around and drive cars and be doctors
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:20.760]  uh-uh you are going home and you're gonna put a bag over your head and that's
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:27.480]  the end of that and that's victory because they do not want the establishment
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:31.280]  does not want the Middle East and North Africa or any other country for that
[02:13:31.280 --> 02:13:38.840]  matter region to rise up to build itself up and they do not want countries that
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:43.480]  are upwardly mobile and so they have been bombed into the Stone Age and they
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:50.560]  will be kept there and the more people get killed the better the globalist they
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:54.760]  could care less about US troops and mercenaries that die and they sure could
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:14:00.600]  care less about the Libyan people and so this is a huge humanitarian bloodbath
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:08.760]  in the name of peace by our peace laureate Qaddafi has fled Tripoli
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:15.280]  headquarters ransacked by rebels that is confirmed they've taken over one of
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:21.880]  his bases and are now in tunnel battles all under the country trying to find
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:29.320]  out where Qaddafi is and Qaddafi is you can say whatever you want about him he is
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:34.040]  a fighter he knows that when they kill him he's gonna be a martyr so they're
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:43.440]  gonna try to not killing but Qaddafi is probably gonna go out shooting they've
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:47.600]  put a big price on his head to trying to get his inner circle to turn against him
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:58.920]  so very disgusting what's going on there and some of the other news it's been
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:03.040]  confirmed at the Green Square video that you were shown three days ago the
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:08.640]  rebels occupying it was fake and was shot another country but it worked it
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:13.760]  the Libyans saw that and thought oh the city's been taken and the special forces
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:18.600]  that were inserted creating havoc were able to create enough fear to get
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:22.360]  Qaddafi's forces to basically run around a wild goose chase looking for them
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:26.440]  long enough for the rebels to converge and start destroying government
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:31.720]  buildings and basically panic and route Qaddafi's forces so they just kept
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:38.040]  trying the same sigh up over and over again till it worked now here's the big
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:41.920]  issue of the day and I really should have opened the show with this I think I
[02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:47.240]  mentioned it but I should probably shoot a special report on this alone because
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:54.280]  this is the threat I've seen from the beginning they corner Qaddafi he could
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:16:01.280]  really activate some previously paid off sleeper cells similar to the sleeper
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:06.520]  cells that attacked in Tripoli and linked up with the flotilla that came in
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:11.760]  in the night with the Arab Al Qaeda fighters backed by British SAS French
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:18.120]  commandos US commandos they could activate real sleeper cells in the
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:23.120]  west blow some stuff up which is basically giving the globalist if Qaddafi
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:30.800]  does that a big present which makes me think that's why Qaddafi hasn't launched
[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:34.840]  nerve gas or hasn't attacked Europe as he threatened to do because then that
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:41.960]  will only legitimize some of this so they'll probably do it the guarantee of
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:44.240]  they're looking at stage and stuff I don't know they're gonna pull the trigger
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:49.640]  and blaming it on Qaddafi to then legitimize it well see he's a terrorist he
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:53.440]  blew up a school bus if Qaddafi was really gonna do things he'd have sleeper
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:17:03.040]  cells to target politicians here you know sleeper cells that would wait say a
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:10.800]  year or go after certain bankers or certain oil company heads but but the
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:14.360]  truth is most these countries don't really have terror forces they don't
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:18.840]  have special forces they don't have sleeper cells that's America that has
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:22.720]  that because we're not America we're run by the bankers and they have sleeper
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:26.320]  cells blow stuff up and blame it on whoever they want to invade next so the
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:31.400]  truth is you never know who's really staging these things you sure know who's
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:34.720]  got scripts out minutes though to capitalize on these events don't you
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:42.720]  yep our horror media nuclear expert warns of Libya dirty bomb who dirty bomb
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:48.320]  they're gonna get you a research center near Tripoli has stocks of nuclear
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:53.040]  material that could be used to make a dirty bomb a former senior UN inspectors
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:57.760]  said on Wednesday warning of possible looting during turmoil in Libya oh yeah
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:01.240]  that's the other narrative Al Qaeda that's that's the good Al Qaeda there
[02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:05.760]  there's bad Al Qaeda and our media says then there's loving good Al Qaeda now
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:10.360]  loving good Al Qaeda is real Al Qaeda that's actually actually killed US
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:16.040]  soldiers in Iraq then there's the bad fairy tale Al Qaeda that supposedly
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:21.480]  carries out the terror attacks but they're saying that the bad Al Qaeda
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:27.560]  might get the the the fissile material that a CIA officer was caught four months
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:34.240]  ago trying to give to the Pakistani Al Qaeda but the ISA stopped him before they
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:41.600]  could do that frame up and so now they're they're saying that somebody
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:46.360]  could get it and dirty bomb us and then they'll tell us that it came from from
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:51.400]  Libya and Muammar Gaddafi and Al Qaeda because he works with Al Qaeda don't
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:55.840]  you know he was the guy to first put out an interpol arrest warrant for him in
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:00.200]  96 and then they tried to have Al Qaeda assassinating that's all confirmed but
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:04.880]  but see he's Al Qaeda that's why Al Qaeda just took over the country cuz cuz
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:08.880]  cuz cuz they're fighting who they work for Muammar Gaddafi because the
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:14.720]  television said so seeking to mend ties with the West Libyan's Muammar
[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:19.560]  Gaddafi agreed in 2003 to abandon efforts to acquire nuclear chemical and
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:23.600]  biological weapons a move that brought him in from the cold and helped in
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:29.840]  decades of Libyan isolation and the setup you know Gaddafi really sold out to
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:33.200]  the globalist before he kept most the wealth and gave it to the population and
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:37.120]  kept some for himself in the last eight years he did start giving it to the
[02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:42.440]  bankers and you see how they repaid him just like they're gonna repay all you
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:46.200]  u.s. military people by taking your pension funds same thing for you
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:53.520]  mercenaries but hey so they're now saying Al Qaeda Libya you're gonna get us

[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:38.920]  our stories up at drunchreport.com on the right hand side cops confiscate
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:46.560]  cameras at Ohio congressman's town hall and it I see these type of videos all
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:51.600]  the time now it's just becoming mainstream you have a public meeting
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:57.520]  town hall people want a video tape it and the congressman who's supposedly a
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:03.720]  public servant doesn't want it seen so he tells cops to take cameras away from
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:07.080]  people and then we've got video in fact you can roll it behind me while I talk
[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:12.880]  because the audio isn't very good of them then wrestling a camera away from a
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:22.000]  middle-aged woman a older lady I mean this is insane but then they leave the
[02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:27.120]  mainstream news camera there you know they're allowed to it's only low-level
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:33.760]  slaves like old ladies she looks like she's probably 65 70 she's not allowed
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:41.080]  to have it and so she's got to she's got to get grabbed here and and and have her
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:45.600]  camera taken a congress from from Ohio had cops grab the camera of
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:50.120]  constituents during a town hall meeting what type of arrogant lunatic is this
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:59.040]  guy I mean does he understand just the ridiculous PR nature of this Steve
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:04.720]  Chabot a Republican had cell phones and cameras confiscated in order to prevent
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:09.520]  an embarrassing YouTube for making the rounds according to Carlos Miller who
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:13.160]  runs a blog documenting efforts by the state to stable the first amendment
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:18.400]  rights of photographers yeah I've had cops many times well I'll be like 200
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:22.520]  yards away videotaping a checkpoint or something they'll walk over go excuse me
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:27.440]  what are you doing here I go I'm just videotaping this well who are you well
[02:26:27.440 --> 02:26:32.440]  I'm Alex Jones independent news well let me see your ID now hold on just a
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:36.480]  minute I'll show it to you even though it's not the law failure to ID the
[02:26:36.480 --> 02:26:39.520]  courts have ruled it I don't care if you got a law here in this town you know
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:43.360]  it's been thrown out and by then the cops are going well this guy can talk I'm
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:47.200]  gonna stand back because I'm nice to him I'm calm sometimes I'll say hey how
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:51.320]  you doing buddy and then they'll sometimes they'll still say well I don't
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:55.720]  want you videotaping and I'll say am I interfering with you and if they say yes
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:27:04.920]  I go at 200 yards away I'm interfering and I'll say alright how far would you
[02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:09.960]  like me to back off just to illustrate how absurd and they'll say down there at
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:13.440]  that corner at one time this happened when the guys were down there videotaping
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:18.320]  at the IRS they had to move back like 300 yards and then more cops came and said
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.200]  move back even more because at the end of the day I'm not trying to get arrested
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:28.000]  now sometimes if I've got a tape I'll say and this is on tape I'll say nope go
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.800]  ahead and arrest me I'm not interfering with what you're doing especially when
[02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:35.720]  it's our demonstration and the cops show up and say you can't videotape I just
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:41.160]  say look this isn't a third-world country do you want your kids to grow up in a
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:44.320]  third-world country where they don't have a right stand on a street corner with
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:48.880]  video camera and the cop will say look I've been ordered to tell you to go well
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:52.400]  call your boss over here and then I remember once at a Rick Perry
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:57.480]  demonstration here comes the boss yeah you don't have a permit to demonstrate
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:03.400]  and I said the city of Austin's lost scores of lawsuits over this do you want
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:07.400]  a new lawsuit I don't want to sue you but I'm gonna sue you personally as well
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:11.840]  don't violate my first amendment I go officer I know the law if I wanted to
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:15.960]  block a road for a demonstration then I'd have to get a permit because you'd
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:22.080]  have to provide a roadblock and he goes nevertheless I'm gonna arrest you I go
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:27.640]  go ahead then pal and the cops backed off and didn't I mean what is wrong with
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:35.640]  you people man these are your rights to okay every time you butcher somebody
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:44.120]  else's rights every time you run over somebody's liberties you trample your
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:54.640]  own and this cop at a public town hall in some college gymnasium is just I can't
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:29:03.080]  believe that because a congressman told him to not videotape and I guess what
[02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:07.280]  happened is some union or something showed up and so because he didn't like
[02:29:07.280 --> 02:29:10.200]  the fact because they're all wearing the same shirt I'm guessing at who this
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:15.880]  group is but reportedly they were peaceful that that that oh look there's

[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:27.320]  prison planet TV member today Perry zooms to the front of the pack for 2012 GOP
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:33.520]  nomination and remember I told you that his pledge was fake not to run I told
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:38.120]  you he would run I've even told you the plan Sarah Palin's gonna wait she's
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:41.840]  gonna get in later then they're gonna be number one and number two and she's
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:47.880]  gonna join him as the vice presidential candidate now I told you this 14 months
[02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:54.200]  ago they may change the plan but so far they're following it with precision
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:58.320]  now Ron Paul is the number one number two or number three in every straw poll
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:03.160]  and every scientific poll he's number three right now in this new Gallup
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:09.080]  poll that's on him full wars.com it's also the top story on drudge right now
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:15.240]  drudgereport.com and Ron Paul is number three behind Mitt Romney and Rick Perry
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:21.680]  two truly fake people you think Obama's fake these guys are just as fake or
[02:38:21.680 --> 02:38:26.720]  worse especially Rick Perry I mean Rick Perry is and and and Mitt Romney is
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:36.400]  muy bad but I mean Rick Perry is is Beelzebub and I was talking to my
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:41.040]  friends I mean they're like they may vote for Obama if Rick Perry actually gets
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:45.400]  the lead look it's all bad out you can't vote for either one of these guys and
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:49.200]  they just keep trying to demonize Ron Paul so that he can't win we've just got
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:53.720]  to expose this hoax but he is no doubt number two or number three right now he
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:58.400]  was number one but Rick Perry came in to say get rid of the Federal Reserve to
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:02.320]  destroy the New World Order and a lot of people that just woke up a lot of
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:05.920]  folks we've woken up said well he's the younger Ron Paul let's go with him
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:10.680]  you're being betrayed don't get in the car with that man little boy little
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:15.760]  girl now for the balance of the hour maybe a little bit into overdrive if
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:20.040]  you'll do it with us as somebody who I've heard a lot about I know Willie
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:23.520]  Nelson said you know my buddy Gatewood Galbraith I'm like no Willie but I've
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:29.000]  certainly heard of him and to go over this whole guy's history he's an author
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:35.560]  you know political analyst all around rabble rouser and I know he well he's
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:44.480]  got a couple different publications out there and he's also got a book out that
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:50.160]  I think says it all and I'll probably just let Gatewood you know describe for
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:55.880]  folks who he is and what his political views are for folks that may not know
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:40:02.280]  who he is but he wrote the last free man in America meets the synthetic subversion
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:08.000]  and I like that term and so it is a good to have Gatewood Galbraith join us from
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.840]  Kentucky thanks for coming on well thank you very much Alex it's a pleasure and
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:16.360]  I listen to you every chance I get on my computer and I want to thank you for the
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:20.480]  great work that you're doing and getting the message out there wow I didn't know
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:23.960]  you were a listener well thank you sir we've got a happy up for a full hour in
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:28.080]  the near future because I really enjoy so many of your ideas and views did you
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:32.240]  ever think you could get this crazy and this bad as it has today I mean tell
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:36.000]  folks about your political awakening and and and your view of what's going on
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.800]  right now in America well very briefly and I did write a book called the last
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:44.040]  free man and people get it on Amazon and all but I'm not here to sell the book
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:51.960]  very briefly I was a child of the 60s 21 years old in 1968 I was barely
[02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:56.040]  graduating from high school because I was just different I was 24 years old went
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:00.040]  into Marines got discharged Marines because of asthma I didn't know that
[02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:04.920]  asthma cured cured that marijuana cured asthma I was 19 years old and when I was
[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:08.320]  21 a friend of mine the doctor told me to spoke marijuana for my asthma and
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:12.520]  bang it cured it right away so I became a champion of it and talked about
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:17.240]  changing the laws I was 24 years old in a milkman but I decided I was a grist
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:21.480]  for the mill and gonna end up in prison or dead so I had better learn the system
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:25.280]  so I decided to go to college to become an attorney and while I was gonna do that
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:28.760]  I was gonna become governor of Kentucky and lift Kentucky out of poverty by
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:33.560]  changing the marijuana laws so I was in 1971 I've gotten up every day for the
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:38.360]  last 40 years to do exactly that I became an attorney I had to try to change
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:42.440]  marijuana laws but other states that beat us to it I was really trying to
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:46.160]  revitalize Kentucky's economy over it it looks like we still may be able to but
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:51.200]  I've run for office on various occasions I ran for Commissioner by culture 1983
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:57.920]  in Democratic primary ran in 91 and 95 in the Democratic primary ran in 1999 as
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:01.840]  the reform party candidate for governor and got spent $20,000 and
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:09.160]  got 15.3 percent of the vote went to ran for Congress 2000 2002 as the
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:14.600]  independent got 27 percent of the vote is independent in 2002 I think it's fair
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:19.200]  to say you're best known for being a leading person against the prohibition
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:23.320]  against him that was the case that was the case but it's broadened out so much
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:26.560]  and that's how they've killed five men that's how they marginalized me in my
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:31.760]  past races but I am a candidate an independent candidate now Alex
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:35.160]  our governor in this November race there's only three governor's races this
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:40.120]  year I am an independent and we've already caught up with the Republican in
[02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:45.000]  this race I saw that in the polls and that shows how hungry the people are for
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:49.120]  real real change we're going to get into that but but the reason I thought to get
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:54.160]  you on last week was when I saw this article out of alternate then I went
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:57.480]  and looked it up and found some local newspaper articles saying that it was
[02:42:57.480 --> 02:43:03.360]  basically true how JP Morgan took over all of Kentucky's financial services and
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:09.320]  why you should be be scared JP Morgan is obviously in a lot of trouble they've
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:15.000]  been caught selling fraudulent paper so is Goldman Sachs the headline is could
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  blank find face prison the Goldman Sachs CEO didn't get a big time criminal
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:24.840]  defense lawyer because he's worried about an SEC wrist slap there's a real
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:28.680]  possibility of doing times as former Goldman managing director know me
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:33.800]  Prince but but we see Kentucky really with the banksters the robber barons in
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:38.200]  there for a long time yeah as a model for what they've done in other parts of
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:42.000]  the country what can you tell us about this report well it's absolutely true
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.040]  Chase Bank now owns Kentucky during all the financial transactions cutting all
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:49.960]  the paychecks and all but this is just a step of the implementation of the New
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:55.200]  World Order and global economy you know Kentucky has been the victim of free
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:58.720]  trade where the human beings no longer count as part of the trade
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:02.920]  relationships are and now that's doing it to us on a domestic basis where human
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:06.280]  beings no longer count but what's happening is that we're being taken over
[02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:10.440]  by the people I call the petrochemical pharmaceutical military industrial
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:15.440]  transnational corporate fascist elite SOB's you know we've never said the
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:18.560]  pledge believe this is like the United States of America or to the Republic for
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:21.800]  which it stands and they're not warm and fuzzy about you and me or our children
[02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:24.920]  or grandchildren and they see the Constitution and the Bill of Rights as
[02:44:24.920 --> 02:44:29.240]  impediments to the implementation of a new world order in global economy and
[02:44:29.240 --> 02:44:32.960]  you know this is just one of the small steps towards that globalization I ain't
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:35.760]  going down without a fight and we're going to use the state of Kentucky to do
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:40.880]  exactly that Alex let me tell you and our listeners we have a hell of a shot at
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.080]  winning governor of the state of Kentucky is independent with no party
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:50.760]  affiliation whatsoever it will be the biggest blow for independence and
[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:55.080]  sovereignty individual sovereignty that ever happened because I'm a very good
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:59.040]  water conservative and I don't listen to Limbaugh and Hannity I listen to
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:03.480]  Jefferson and Adams and Washington and Franklin those are my advisors and how
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:07.200]  to get good state of Kentucky out of poverty but trying to rediscover the
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:10.680]  values that were supposed to make America great and did it one time before
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:14.600]  they came under such assault absolutely I mean if you run on ending banker
[02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:19.520]  occupation of Kentucky it can be the same phenomenon with Rand no matter how
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:23.400]  much they demonized him it backfired on him and as you were saying I've seen
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:27.240]  those polls that's really got him scared that you've now pulled past the
[02:45:27.240 --> 02:45:31.160]  Republican so you've got a good chance of actually winning this time it's
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:34.720]  unbelievable brother I mean really the big shift is going to come in the last
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:40.240]  10 days but I said I said back when they ran the first poem we had 5% I said
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:44.640]  if we have if we have double figures by May we have 15 to 20 percent by
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:50.640]  September we're gonna win it we had 15% of 10 days before September so you know
[02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:54.280]  we have a heck of a shot if we need support Kentucky the poor state and I
[02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:58.280]  we stand for the poor folks you know any for visitors out there can go to
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:02.240]  gatewood.com and make the contribution I understand you may have as many as three
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:05.880]  or four or five million listeners Alex we do have five or six over the whole
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:09.240]  week but usually at one time there's probably a million people listening
[02:46:09.240 --> 02:46:13.440]  conservatively and then it kind of lives forever on the internet again what's the
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:19.080]  best website for folks to visit it's gatewood.com gatewood.com and you know
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:23.240]  they can eat there'll be a gatewood at gatewood.com you know what I really like
[02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:27.360]  to find Alex is what we'd all like to find I'd like to find a patron you know
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:32.640]  somebody who says I can put 50,000 into liberating Kentucky because I'm an
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:38.280]  attorney dude they always pay me a fee but listen tell me this what what what
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:44.120]  what would you do as governor of Kentucky? Okay here's the thing Kentucky
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:47.760]  dysfunctional right now both parties have their horns locked up like Tupole
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:51.360]  out fighting over territory while the business of people lays dead in the dust
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:56.640]  so what we first got to do is we've got to unlock those horns up there I want
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:46:59.840]  both parties to succeed I don't want to throw them out I want to do what they're
[02:46:59.840 --> 02:47:03.680]  supposed to do we're independent we don't care who gets credit for doing
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:07.360]  what's right just as long as they get the job done so we're gonna be we're
[02:47:07.360 --> 02:47:11.520]  totally nonpartisan we're gonna invite the best intention to both parties to
[02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:14.360]  come together and finally start addressing some of Kentucky's perennial
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:18.000]  problems but the first thing we had to do Alex is we've got to return
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.400]  transparency and integrity and trust into the system itself because there's a
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:26.640]  lot of good-minded well-intentioned people who won't even take part in the
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:31.160]  political process now because it's so mean-spirited and corrupt we need to get
[02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:35.080]  the decent-minded people back involved in the running of the people's affairs
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:39.520]  that's number one number two but we've got to find jobs and economy in this
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:43.400]  state we've got to downsize the government we've got to put the best
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:47.400]  active on the people the corporations have gotten so many tactics
[02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:50.400]  exemptions in the state of Kentucky that is the wage earner and the small
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:54.120]  business that are bearing the brunt of the cost well we'll get what expanding
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:59.440]  on that and looking at the rest of the country the same problems that Kentucky
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:04.320]  has are the same problems that we've got here and when you look at the fact that
[02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:08.720]  General Electric and Google and all these people pay zero are almost zero
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:13.800]  taxes and exempt themselves then they have Warren Buffett lecturing people on
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:17.320]  raising taxes on the rich but he's really talking about the middle class
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:23.040]  because the big corporates get most of that corporate welfare I mean that's
[02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:27.640]  really the big issue right there huge issue the attack has been called the
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:31.120]  combo the council for economic development that gives out tax and
[02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:35.840]  finish to get jobs to locate here and in 1993 the head of that said
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:41.000]  publicly I have a plan forever Kentucky about the year 2012 80% of
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:44.800]  Kentucky's are gonna be earning eight dollars an hour but how do you like it
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:48.000]  so far you know who's gonna buy the houses who's gonna buy the cars who's
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.720]  gonna start the families you know those corporate dividends fighting in eight
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:54.920]  dollar an hour jobs that's not creating a tax base we're never gonna be able to
[02:48:54.920 --> 02:48:58.680]  tax those eight dollar an hour earners but what that does it just puts extra
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:02.880]  dividends into the pockets of the dividends of these shareholders and so it
[02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:09.360]  is like it is a cannibalism well that's like JP Morgan out sources the
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:14.080]  unemployment phone banks and the welfare phone banks to India I mean if
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:19.920]  you're gonna have welfare it is the job servicing it by law should be in the
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:23.280]  United States my brother-in-law went through Wendy's the other day they went
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:26.960]  across a little bing-dong and the lady took his order and he got it he said
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:30.640]  it's down nice I'd like to buy your frosty she says I'm sorry you can't
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.360]  you know I'd like to he says you can't throw around in India I mean drive
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:38.200]  through at Wendy's you know they're paying who was who was hitting on the
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:43.400]  Wendy's girl my brother-in-law was trying to fire frosty but she was in India boy
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:49.960]  he's something else you guys is it like I tell you going back to high school in
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:53.960]  college that is the quickest way to get a date is just go after the waitress

[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.920]  grandmother all look good to me so don't be talking about I'm married but I
[02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:06.880]  it's it's funny I know I just your brother-in-law must be hilarious wait
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:11.920]  my brother-in-law he's married and he's talking to the girl with the frosty now

[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:25.840]  crossroads as is America this this election is a microcosm of next year's

[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:16.880]  minute TV show we have a lot of networks and cable systems that want to pick it
[02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:21.000]  up so we're developing it over the next few months for prison planet dot TV
[02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.600]  viewers expanded reports you name it and then also then deploy it onto certain
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:30.200]  networks cable systems around the world now well obviously up to having back up
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:34.320]  to really get into him because he was talking about how he gets pigeonholed
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:39.600]  with that but it really is a miracle plant most varieties of course don't
[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:44.160]  have any THC in it but those are banned from agricultural development even
[02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:50.640]  though most are sailing ship sales the ropes the clothes until the 30s were
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:55.600]  made out of it it was a bigger crop is cotton Canadians can grow it Russians
[02:54:55.600 --> 02:55:01.480]  can grow it Americans can't and that doesn't sound too free to me does it
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:11.480]  sound sound like a freedom to you but going back to our guest it you're right
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:20.520]  it is a very exciting snapshot to show how awake the population's getting that
[02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:25.440]  that your number two in a three-way race right now in Kentucky and just like
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:29.280]  ran came from behind I think you can win if people get behind you but I don't
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:32.880]  think it's any doubt about it we hit when we hit 20% that's going to be the
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:36.320]  critical mass you know right now there's a lot of well-intentioned people out
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:39.000]  there who's just saying well I'm afraid I'll waste my vote of vote for him
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:42.240]  because I don't think he can win but as soon as they see that I'm in second
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:46.320]  place and it was in the gap then that whole avalanche that whole critical
[02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:49.360]  map is going to be reached and this will be the first time and I think it was
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:53.320]  somebody in Rhode Island who used to be a US senator who went independent and
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:57.760]  one governor but it would be the first legitimate truly independent governor
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:02.000]  elected in the United States America for at least 150 years and we're going to do
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:05.680]  it on almost no money you know we're going to be outspent in this race we're
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:11.760]  going to be outspent about 40 to 50 to 1 and I'm a criminal defense attorney is
[02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:15.600]  what I do for a living and we don't have any special interest and and I put about
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:19.160]  a hundred thousand into it and the other folks that put in maybe forty fifty
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:22.720]  thousand so here we spent you know maybe a hundred forty thousand they've
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:26.440]  already spent millions that we're gaining on so you know a little bit of
[02:56:26.440 --> 02:56:30.560]  money goes a long way when you tell them the truth and plus my stock line is look
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:33.920]  folks I've run before if I was gonna lie to you I would already have been
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:39.320]  elected how are the Tea Party people liking you obviously they are or you
[02:56:39.320 --> 02:56:43.400]  wouldn't be doing so well in the polls but of course you know I spoke at the
[02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:47.160]  first three Tea Parties here in Kentucky and I told them then I said don't let the
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:52.320]  Republicans subsume you don't let the Republicans co-opt you you know stay
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:56.120]  strong that's where your real strength is so I spoke to the first three of them
[02:56:56.120 --> 02:57:00.880]  and did I was I was introduced as the person to whom Tea Party should apply so
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:04.960]  then last year I went to a big rally over in a lot of other people got into it
[02:57:04.960 --> 02:57:08.080]  started taking it off on their own probably can be to her but I went to a
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:11.280]  big one last year and I walked up to the front and one of the leaders says thank
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:14.200]  you for joining us Kate Wood and I said what do you mean thank you for joining
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:18.560]  me where the hell you've been the last 30 years you know oh I know it's
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:23.360]  incredible what do you think of the media has been proven by a few research
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:27.720]  blocking Ron Paul out and when they do talk about him demonizing him I think
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:31.600]  it's horrible I mean I contributed to him I wrote him in for president this
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:35.320]  last time Ron Paul is the most whether you agree with him or not is the most
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:40.640]  principal person that I have ever seen elected in my lifetime you know and I
[02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:44.680]  they demonize him they boy got him just the same way they did me the top two
[02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:49.320]  papers in the state would even print my name for my first four elections would
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:53.320]  even print my name for the first four elections you know because I stood out
[02:57:53.320 --> 02:57:56.600]  there I wanted to return him as a cash crop to our farmers not wanted to get
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:58:00.200]  medical marijuana in the hands of all the sick and dying people you know 30
[02:58:00.200 --> 02:58:03.680]  years ago that was I mean consider coming out with that 30 years ago you
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:07.760]  know absolutely but think of Kentucky would have been the first to do that you
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:11.320]  could have been sold it all over the world that the cotton you know the
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:16.240]  hemp cotton all of it that really would have turbocharged Kentucky Alex you
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:19.160]  know we ought to get on and talk about hemp as petroleum because that's what
[02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:23.920]  it is in this petroleum you get 20 barrels of petroleum off an acre of
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:29.080]  hemp it's real value is in biofuel and be planted seven percent of the US
[02:58:29.080 --> 02:58:32.720]  agricultural land and hemp we wouldn't have to import another drop of oil and
[02:58:32.720 --> 02:58:36.480]  as you know hemp grows rather stuff won't gatewood Galbra thank you so much
