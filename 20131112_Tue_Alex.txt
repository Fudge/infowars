[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:35.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  Well, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas has done it again and it's the top story up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  It looks like it's basically crashed a national review site, at least for now.
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  He's done it again, Acorn 2.0.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  It is Acorn-style groups that have been taking over the navigator jobs.
[01:02.000 --> 01:19.000]  It's been out of Kit Daniels here months ago, pointing out that it is groups with felony backgrounds and fraud backgrounds that are being given the contracts to carry out the navigators that come up and basically intimidate you into your social security number and driver's license number.
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  Well, now the shock video has just broken.
[01:23.000 --> 01:35.000]  Remember when he, years ago, I guess four years ago, went in and would go into multiple Acorn facilities and he would say, yes, I've got underage prostitutes that we've basically kidnapped and brought into the country.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  We're running, you know, sex slavery rings and it'd be fantastic.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  We'll teach you how to cover that up.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.000]  And then that, of course, brought down Acorn.
[01:42.000 --> 01:43.000]  Well, it didn't bring them down.
[01:43.000 --> 01:46.000]  They just went and renamed new organizations.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  But it did cut one of the big heads off, the Hydra, but we've got to cut all the heads off.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  Well, it's back.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  It is back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56.000 --> 02:11.000]  And they are there to get just literally billions of health care, health and human services dollars to go out and browbeat everyone into this.
[02:11.000 --> 02:26.000]  And now the navigators talk about how they lie to people on the consultations that they have with them to not let them know what really goes on with Obamacare and see the navigators.
[02:26.000 --> 02:36.000]  Folks are there to identify people that think they're going to get free health care so they can be put on a list so they can have their wages garnished.
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  If they ever get a job or have their refund check taken or their bank account grabbed.
[02:42.000 --> 02:48.000]  It was like the homeless guy that was on charity care and he found 850 bucks and went and turned it into police.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  And so they said, well, you have money now.
[02:50.000 --> 02:51.000]  You don't get health care.
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  This is written by the insurance companies, by the big hospitals to turn people away.
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  Period.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  That's what's going on.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  That's what's happening.
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.000]  That's what's unfolding.
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  And it is just over the top incredible that this is going on.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  Absolutely, totally and completely over the top.
[03:15.000 --> 03:28.000]  Now, that said, the other top stories on infowars.com and it's also one of the top stories I noticed on DrudgeReport.com right there in the middle, right there in the middle column.
[03:28.000 --> 03:38.000]  DHS funds installation of white boxes that can track population and actually haven't printed that article.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  Well, you guys print me that.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  Oh, actually, I do have it here in my stack.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  I'm just so much news.
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  I'm overwhelmed.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  And then that dovetails with information we got last night.
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  We confirmed the source.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  I'm not going to say where they are in government in Seattle.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  And we have an entire document we're going over right now.
[03:58.000 --> 04:06.000]  We're looking at excising some of the names to protect the innocent or some people in government that are in separate departments.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  But it looks like right now we can just publish the whole thing.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  This is Snowden level revelations.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  Snowden level revelations.
[04:15.000 --> 04:26.000]  We published stories the last two days about the street lights that listen to you about the white boxes put in by DHS that admittedly track your cell phone location.
[04:26.000 --> 04:34.000]  It's all to coordinate the cameras and the other surveillance systems on you and your cell phone ID.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  You don't have a chip in your arm.
[04:36.000 --> 04:41.000]  You have a chip in the phone attached to your name, you understand and GPS tracking you.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  So these boxes triangulate down to one foot where you're at and then they can have the cameras and everything track you as you go place to place.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  And then it creates a total record.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  This is unbelievably huge.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  It is NSA DHS run.
[04:56.000 --> 05:22.000]  This is Snowden level revelations breaking.
[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[05:29.000 --> 05:35.000]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  To learn more visit infowarshealth.com.

[06:00.000 --> 06:07.000]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  Renowned author and expert Joel Scalzen.
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.000]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming.
[06:17.000 --> 06:19.000]  They want that attack to come.
[06:19.000 --> 06:26.000]  Joel Scalzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[06:26.000 --> 06:28.000]  What I tell people is that you do have time.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  We talk about natural disasters.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  The health environment.
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000]  We talk about pollution.
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  The water quality.
[06:33.000 --> 06:41.000]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  This Christmas give the gift of preparedness.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  Strategic relocation to film with Joel Scalzen and Alex Jones.
[06:51.000 --> 07:00.000]  Available only at infowarshop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  My friends Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[07:06.000 --> 07:13.000]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[07:26.000 --> 07:32.000]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[07:36.000 --> 07:44.000]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available at infowarslife.com.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  Survival Shield nascent iodine.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  Secure your super high quality nascent iodine today at infowarslife.com.
[07:58.000 --> 08:12.000]  That's infowarslife.com.
[08:12.000 --> 08:32.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:32.000 --> 08:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Tuesday Worldwide edition of The Transmission.
[08:42.000 --> 08:56.000]  It, of course, is now the 12th day of November 2013 and we have a total information overload of just bombshell level developments.
[08:56.000 --> 09:07.000]  The company getting DHS funding to put in street lights that have video cameras and microphones to secretly videotape and listen to you,
[09:07.000 --> 09:18.000]  admits that they have voice print analysis systems to be able to track you by name everywhere you go.
[09:18.000 --> 09:27.000]  And the government already through NSA systems tied to your phone number and other systems has most people's digital photo and their biometric voice print,
[09:27.000 --> 09:36.000]  as well as face print and thumb print or index fingerprint at the DMV to get into college to get library books.
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  They've been phasing it all in.
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.000]  But most importantly now off of your cell phone, they know your personal ID and that that cell phone is yours.
[09:45.000 --> 09:58.000]  And so they use the tracking of the cell phone location to integrate it into a computer system to identify that John Doe is at the corner of second in liberty or second in tyranny, I should say.
[09:58.000 --> 10:12.000]  And then they're able to scan the audio and then attach it to your cell phone ID and then create a voice print key to put into the database if they didn't have your biometric voice print before.
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  Now, I know about all this because MIT and others 15 years ago openly published reports saying this is what they were rolling out, what they were developing.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  They also have at Walmart, Target and other places hidden retina scanners.
[10:25.000 --> 10:38.000]  This has been going on for at least a decade that scan in on your iris or your retina and create a digital print of that that now they can have when you walk into the store.
[10:38.000 --> 10:46.000]  The video camera is scanning in live time and then as soon as you turn your head up, they have lights aimed to get a print and then identify who you are.
[10:46.000 --> 10:52.000]  And then as you go to the store, you're being retina scanned or iris scanned analysis.
[10:52.000 --> 11:05.000]  So this is the information, ladies and gentlemen, that we are breaking down here today.
[11:05.000 --> 11:14.000]  Last night, again, Watson published a report that's gone into the featured news archive that we're going to be going over.
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.000]  We're going to have repost to the front page of infowars.com where the company admits this is going on.
[11:20.000 --> 11:35.000]  Separately, we separately have even the New York Times admitting that the gunshot detectors aren't really gunshot detectors, that they really are listening to audio and are now being used in crimes.
[11:35.000 --> 11:55.000]  Remember a few months ago, the DHS came out and it got leaked in documents in court and it was confirmed that the NSA is hooked into by several thousand major companies that dump their data in in exchange to get illegal data back.
[11:55.000 --> 12:15.000]  It's a big criminal pool, but more importantly, it came out that the major NSA systems when you talk about smoking marijuana with your friends or you talk about, you know, you have a pill addiction or whatever, that is all categorized and put in your master file.
[12:15.000 --> 12:29.000]  And the DEA goes through that without warrants. And then if they decide they want to prosecute you, they go create a fraudulent court docket with a fraudulent investigation with a fraudulent witness and an informant that swears to it.
[12:29.000 --> 12:38.000]  And then that is admitted into court. The judge engages in mass fraud consciously. And then you are convicted actually with NSA data illegally.
[12:38.000 --> 12:45.000]  The New York Times again reported last week that they are now admitting it in court and just saying we dispense with the Bill of Rights entirely.
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.000]  We will now use NSA data to convict, but you're not allowed to use NSA data to prove your innocence.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  They know full well that you're innocent in most cases.
[12:56.000 --> 13:09.000]  They have the Williamson County prosecutor and judge just now been indicted and arrested for knowingly setting someone up, knowing who really killed the wife in a famous case.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  And it's just standard. And that's the Michael Morton case.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  And this is what they do. Now, not every city or county is run by these evil people, but when you're run by evil, they don't want criminals in jail.
[13:21.000 --> 13:30.000]  They want nonviolent prisoners to work as slaves. This is how slavery has been re legalized. You understand?
[13:30.000 --> 13:38.000]  And so again, I've given you just a few data points there because there's thousands of these data points that are there.
[13:38.000 --> 13:47.000]  But the company admits that new smart lights can analyze voices and track people with the voice prints.
[13:47.000 --> 13:57.000]  But again, more importantly, if they don't have your voice print, they pick it up with a voice print because they put DHS boxes in these systems and others nationwide.
[13:57.000 --> 14:06.000]  We know because six years ago, this first broken England that they had boxes, wireless boxes that track your cell phone and then your ID.
[14:06.000 --> 14:15.000]  So cameras can zoom in in a coordinated computer program and digitally scan your face off the cell phone knowing that that's your cell phone.
[14:15.000 --> 14:25.000]  So instead of having a chip under your skin, you're carrying a computer that tracks you, that is connected to your ID.
[14:25.000 --> 14:36.000]  So that's your chip basically that you're holding in your hand that surveils you, that tracks you, that you report to the NSA through Google or through Microsoft Bing.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  When you search, you tell it everywhere you're going, what you're doing.
[14:39.000 --> 14:49.000]  So it's your nexus point, and so off that nexus point, off that tracking beacon, they can then now data mine with biometric cameras, your walk.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  So even if you try to cover your face and don't talk, they now know who you are.
[14:54.000 --> 15:03.000]  Your retina scan, your iris scan, your face scan, your voice print, these white boxes are meant to double and triple data mine this.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  Two years ago, it happened to Derriman Breen.
[15:05.000 --> 15:15.000]  He was able to stand with a first generation Kinect, and this is a big sofa and you can see the entire sofa is in the field of view of the Kinect sensor.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  Now, in addition to its 3D capabilities, Kinect also has a 2D color camera.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  I'm going to turn that on now.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  Hi, Kareem.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  Now you're seeing Kareem and 2D color.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  We've made that color feed 1080p across that large field of view.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  Great for Skype scenarios.
[15:29.000 --> 15:35.000]  But one of the challenges with color camera feeds is that they're very susceptible to changes in room lighting.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  So to show this, we're going to bring down the room lights.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  And gamers, they'll often play a game in a dimly lit room.
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  You often want to watch a movie in the dark.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  You can see that we've just lost Kareem completely in the shadows here.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  This is not very useful anymore.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  So we've introduced a new technology we call Active IR.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  We're going to turn that on now.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  And there's Kareem and Active IR.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  We have the ability to see in the dark with the new Kinect sensor.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  Let me just stop right there.
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  We're playing you a clip of an analysis of the Kinect sensors that everyone is paying to put in their houses.
[16:05.000 --> 16:07.000]  And they're putting them in the churches everywhere.
[16:07.000 --> 16:15.000]  It can see through up to a thousand feet through multiple walls and 3D scans, everything, including your face biometrically.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  Imagine that.
[16:17.000 --> 16:24.000]  You know, like the probes in the Prometheus movie, where they walk in and throw the probes up in the air and they go through scanning the whole structure?
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  That's literally what a Kinect system is.
[16:27.000 --> 16:36.000]  It is a probe that scans biometrically and with the radio waves, 3D bouncing back to a sensor, everything you're doing.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  That's my point.
[16:37.000 --> 16:43.000]  Street lights, cell phones are listening to you, even when they're off, tracking everywhere you go.
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  All the major new video game consoles coming out.
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  Track everything you're doing, run by Microsoft, hooked into the NSA.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Same thing with the new Sony systems coming out.
[16:52.000 --> 17:04.000]  So, see, here's my point. We are totally immersed in this and I haven't even gotten, I haven't even gotten yet to the big breaking news here today.
[17:04.000 --> 17:13.000]  You know that we have been reporting on the street lights that listen to you and watch you and then capture your voice print.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  And they admit that.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  And again, no other media is even analyzing this.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  They'll say, oh, the new street lights watch and listen to you, but they don't point out why they're doing it.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  It's to literally understand everything you're doing for a military takeover.
[17:27.000 --> 17:38.000]  These are the probe systems on record in the globalist own words to absolutely surveil the economy and then start shutting the economy off except for globalist controlled corporations.
[17:38.000 --> 17:46.000]  So it's total war, total siege, total scientific evil and totally illegal and totally insane and totally off the chart.
[17:46.000 --> 17:58.000]  Okay, so we've got, we've got all that information and we have this major breaking news from our source inside government in the state of Washington.
[17:58.000 --> 18:06.000]  This is, this is, this is Snowden level information, ladies and gentlemen, because remember they first lied and said the stone stuff wasn't real.
[18:06.000 --> 18:15.000]  Then they said it was real. Then they said he was a traitor and it was proving that they were listening to you and tracking everything in real time and integrating it all together in one heads up display.
[18:15.000 --> 18:21.000]  Or they can just go in and watch and listen to everything you're doing illegally and they are capturing everything in real time.
[18:21.000 --> 18:27.000]  This now shows the rollout onto the street of the white boxes in Seattle.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  They put them in Austin. They've got them hidden in transformers in Dallas.
[18:31.000 --> 18:44.000]  This has been going in multi generations for several decades, but now these new systems integrate and track your cell phone in live time everywhere you are to integrate all the cameras, the face scanning, the microphones,
[18:44.000 --> 18:52.000]  the police in their own private HD internet to watch and track and stalk you in live time and it gets worse.
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  It gets worse to then have shut down codes just like they're announcing at the Olympics coming up in Russia.
[18:58.000 --> 19:03.000]  The Olympic Committee has said no cell phones will work. No internet will work unless authorized by them.
[19:03.000 --> 19:13.000]  They're putting up white boxes in the Russian city for the Olympics coming up that will kill everybody's cell phones to again control information completely.
[19:13.000 --> 19:23.000]  So understand when they put out free wireless internet that's really paid for by taxpayer money under FCC and all that, it's to bring government control into the internet
[19:23.000 --> 19:30.000]  and it's to shut off everything that's happening when you go to a demonstration or something and the cops start beating everybody in the brain.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  You're not going to be able to even record anything.
[19:33.000 --> 19:39.000]  Apple's already put it in all the new iPhones, all the new droids. They literally send out a code. Everything turns off.
[19:39.000 --> 19:50.000]  So it tracks you, it rapes your rights, it steals your voice, it steals all your data and they hit one button and shut all communications down so they can carry out a Boston bombing.
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.000]  This is the equivalent of high tech aliens invading the earth and setting up a grid to enslave us.
[19:56.000 --> 20:10.000]  This is absolute war against humanity.

[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  This is cloudhashing.com.
[24:22.000 --> 24:36.000]  The systems obviously upset that we have this. We have contacted the city of Seattle. We are contacting them more coming up this afternoon and demanding that they respond to this.
[24:36.000 --> 24:48.000]  This is a department of DHS document that we're reviewing still right now, but I just made the decision to publish the entire thing at infowars.com in the next 15 minutes or so.
[24:48.000 --> 25:00.000]  We're going to put it on a third-party server and put it up. We've got screenshots going up of the wireless spy grids that track everything you do and integrate it into a larger surveillance system.
[25:00.000 --> 25:14.000]  In fact, guys, just go ahead and get the document. We can start showing it on TV. If you're a radio listener and you go to infowars.com, we'll start showing the antenna grids, the white boxes, because what's in this document is more than just the white boxes.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  It's photos and graphs of all the other stuff they've got to watch the American people.
[25:19.000 --> 25:32.000]  Now, when a local Seattle newspaper, a weekly, yesterday said, what are these white boxes? And they wouldn't answer their questions. This has been going on for weeks, but they published yesterday.
[25:32.000 --> 25:48.000]  And they said, oh, it's just our own private communication system. Well, our sources then contacted us, and I'm just going to say that totally confirmed high-level source within the state or city government.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  I will just leave it at that. I'm not going to say city or state. It's going to say within the government.
[25:53.000 --> 26:12.000]  Got us this information. And again, it's all written very dry. It's like the Snowden documents, but right there is how they're tracking you in real time and putting you in a database and grabbing your voice and grabbing your face and just running it all through this trough into the threat fusion center,
[26:12.000 --> 26:30.000]  into Homeland Security, into the Department of Defense. And again, local news is reporting on these and government saying it's just a communication system. And it is. High-def audio and video basically battle command system like the Marines use with a heads-up display where you can say,
[26:30.000 --> 26:46.000]  Alex Jones in the city right now, if I'm there to cover story. All right, cell phone, go to cell phone audio, activate, they go right into my cell phone, listen to everything I'm doing, or they can say triangulate, boom, right to one foot where I met with my ID with that system,
[26:46.000 --> 26:57.000]  and then flip on the microphone, the microphone's already on, but bring in the audio. Voice print, voice print goes through instantly, just like you use your Google phone or whatever and has the voice print, voice print to get you into it.
[26:57.000 --> 27:09.000]  Same deal, boom, voice print, we've got him, we're tracking him. Okay, augment, cut out the other sounds, tune in only to Alex Jones' voice. Your birds honking horns of people talking, they can tune right in.
[27:09.000 --> 27:21.000]  This is all just instantly, just a punch of a button. They tune right in, because I've read about this, seen this on television, but also talked to high-level sources before this stuff was even partially public,
[27:21.000 --> 27:35.000]  and then boom, they tune right in to everything I'm saying in a crowd of people. And remember, you're paying for all of this. While the country goes bankrupt, while everything shuts down, while the government funds al-Qaeda,
[27:35.000 --> 27:51.000]  it is all pointed to get human intelligence through machines on everything you're doing to destroy you, to shut you down, to wreck you, to not let you hide, to not let you, I mean, this is the globalist with machines rolling out.
[27:51.000 --> 28:04.000]  This is science fiction movie. You are living in a total science fiction takeover, run by crazy inbred eugenicists who hate everybody, including their own families.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  And the elites that aren't evil are fleeing to rural areas around the world in armored redoubts.
[28:10.000 --> 28:27.000]  So, they are preparing for a war against us. This is huge breaking news from Anthony Gucciardi and Mikhail Thalen through storyleak.com and infowars.com.
[28:27.000 --> 28:36.000]  This was brought to infowars.com, but brought specifically to these reporters. That's how whistleblowers and folks will operate as they'll pick a reporter to go to in an organization.
[28:36.000 --> 28:43.000]  And both these men have been writing about this with Paul Watson. Drudgereport.com has been carrying it. And this is huge.
[28:43.000 --> 28:51.000]  Okay, this is integrated boxes with the police going, oh, it's just for us to communicate. Just like they'd say, oh, we're putting in cameras 20 years ago for traffic.
[28:51.000 --> 29:02.000]  Well, for the Department of Transportation in your city, county, state, federal, but it has the dual use, the dual use of the police watching and surveilling.
[29:02.000 --> 29:12.000]  And again, not to solve crime, ladies and gentlemen, the governments run by big mega banks that launder the drug money, run the drug aircraft, they run al-Qaeda, they run it all.
[29:12.000 --> 29:20.000]  They're totally ruthless, totally savage, and they look at the naive public like a bunch of children. You really thought Obama would give you some free health care.
[29:20.000 --> 29:33.000]  You really think the neocons care about you. You really think so? When they capture a country like Iraq or somewhere else, they start killing everybody and giving them force inoculations and sterilizing and dropping DU bombs everywhere.
[29:33.000 --> 29:49.000]  The New World Order is evil, evil, evil, totally wicked, set on death and destruction. It's their nature. And you either wake up to this and realize it or you go into the long, dark night of terror.
[29:49.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:19.000 --> 30:31.000]  We're in behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots. MyPatriot Supply brings us their exclusive Patriot Pantry brand, along with many other fine preparedness products.
[30:31.000 --> 30:39.000]  I personally store and use their high quality products. It tastes great and it's easy to store for up to 25 years.
[30:39.000 --> 30:53.000]  For a limited time, you can save $50 instantly on a four-week supply of food, along with other special offers. Visit MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today, with the New World Order making rapid advances on every front.
[30:53.000 --> 31:10.000]  It is essential to prepare with MyPatriot Supply today.
[31:23.000 --> 31:30.000]  It exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen. If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.

This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover. The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[31:55.000 --> 32:01.000]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[32:01.000 --> 32:12.000]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[32:12.000 --> 32:19.000]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[32:19.000 --> 32:31.000]  Now there are hundreds of great products at infowarshop.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[32:31.000 --> 32:41.000]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[32:41.000 --> 32:49.000]  Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to infowarshop.com and to order just three of their products.
[32:49.000 --> 32:55.000]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately.
[32:55.000 --> 33:13.000]  Start your journey to health and wellness today at infowarshop.com.
[33:13.000 --> 33:25.000]  I'm just an average man with an average life. I work from nine to five. Hell, I pay the price. All I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[33:25.000 --> 33:37.000]  But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight soon?
[33:37.000 --> 33:50.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, in every case in history, if you let a government get too big and don't keep it on a short leash, the worst elements will take control of it and build the same nightmare type scenarios.
[33:50.000 --> 33:58.000]  But now it's the year 2013, year of our Lord, and we are in the science fiction zone. We are now in the future.
[33:58.000 --> 34:11.000]  We are now living in the Buck Rogers land, but we're living in a suppressed, slowly developing technological system, whereas the real technological grid is much closer to what they call the singularity,
[34:11.000 --> 34:24.000]  that I believe will be a group of sub-singularities towards a singularity, and that if humanity doesn't actually move to block the singularity, we will lose control and destroy ourselves.
[34:24.000 --> 34:35.000]  But the establishment is in a arms race, politically, geopolitically, economically, physically, mentally, with each other in a power trip.
[34:35.000 --> 34:51.000]  And there are no holds barred, just mega development, rushing open air testing, chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals, electromagnetic manipulation, hundreds of thousands of different programs that have been out there, thousands of patents.
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  I mean, we are just living in a total war zone.
[34:56.000 --> 35:06.000]  And people say, man, that's paranoid. You're fear mongering. No, no, it's going on. It's happening. I'm not paranoid. I am aware. I'm informed. I'm fighting. What about you?
[35:06.000 --> 35:17.000]  I've proven what I'm saying. The only issue is it's so much more than words can say, so much more than I could write in a thousand page history book about what's happened in the last 10 years.
[35:17.000 --> 35:31.000]  It's so over the top because they've got seven and a half billion hardworking people and factories and biotech, and we're just inventing everything and competing with each other and coming up with incredible ideas.
[35:31.000 --> 35:43.000]  They harvest those ideas, move them up to the top of the pyramid for master builders to then, that's what they call themselves and grand architects, to then integrate and build this system.
[35:43.000 --> 35:56.000]  And boy, you can see what they're building. It ain't pretty. You can take one look at it and step back and go. Abomination, desolation, destruction, Armageddon, total dehumanization, blasphemy.
[35:56.000 --> 36:09.000]  And you step back from the technocratic bio mutation system they're building and you realize that they are drunk on the blood of the innocents, all the abortions, the wars, the evil.
[36:09.000 --> 36:14.000]  They're drunk on death and destruction. Evil can make you drunk, folks.
[36:14.000 --> 36:23.000]  I mean, getting into evil, getting into savagery, getting into wickedness, pressing on the nerve of power is a high. I've done it.
[36:23.000 --> 36:33.000]  And I'm not particularly a wicked person, but I am a vicious person at many levels like anybody can be, very primitive, very animalistic at many levels like everybody.
[36:33.000 --> 36:44.000]  But I can definitely understand what they're into. They are drunk, ladies and gentlemen, on excess, on degeneracy, on just blood.
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  As the Bible says, they were, you know, those serving the Antichrist were drunk on the blood of the saints and martyrs.
[36:50.000 --> 37:02.000]  And I am just watching this army of evil swell right now in a bloom, a bloom of just black roses.
[37:02.000 --> 37:15.000]  And I don't even know what to say at this point, ladies and gentlemen, to marvel and to know they're building it to hurt us, knowing they're building it to suppress us, knowing they're building it to wage war against the individual.
[37:15.000 --> 37:21.000]  You can serve them. And if you're healthy and happy, they will destroy you. They're going to take everything. You understand that?
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.000]  They want your soul. They want your health. They want your children. And they have declared it.
[37:27.000 --> 37:35.000]  Is Gucci already ready? As soon as you get the document, you have the document. Bring him in as soon as we can.
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  And we're going to premiere the document for TV viewers. Has it gone live on the story yet?
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  I know we read over it last night today and approved it. Okay, so the PDF is going up now. You have them doing it?
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  Okay, good. We're putting screenshots up right now. We'll go do it. Then I'll bring you in.
[37:50.000 --> 37:58.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it is a war room in here, but exclusive Snowden level documents reveal Stealth DHS spy grid.
[37:58.000 --> 38:09.000]  And part of this document is restricted eyes only, but then it indexes other public documents that they're to give the public.
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  And it's always like that. And so, again, what's going on in Seattle is just the latest rollout of stuff they put in London.
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  Well, it came out in London five years ago. Remember, they were tracking cell phones and lifetime down to IDs and using cameras to integrate with it.
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.000]  See, see, see this tracks off your cell phone. You don't have a chip in your arm. The phone is the chip.
[38:29.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's the little Imperial probe droid that you carry with you. And it's just blowing me away.
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  And the only way you should have a cell phone is if you're aware of what it's doing, that it's radiating you, that it's tracking you,
[38:42.000 --> 38:50.000]  that you're giving it all your data, telling it all your secrets, you're literally giving it confessions every day of your deepest darkest secrets.
[38:50.000 --> 38:59.000]  It knows who you are more than you are. Three years ago, Google with 93% accuracy could predict where you would go eat two weeks from now when you didn't even consciously know.
[38:59.000 --> 39:06.000]  It knows your subconscious. It knows your patterns that you're not aware of. It wants your soul.
[39:06.000 --> 39:16.000]  We got to come back in the next segment with that intro because that's what this is all about. This is about total domination and total control freak.
[39:16.000 --> 39:27.000]  The religion of the control freak will never, will never, ever, ever, ever, ever let you be free.
[39:27.000 --> 39:35.000]  You're like, but I'm not going to oppose it. Good. I love it. This is going to be a party. I hear the nihilist, the Satan is saying that you're going to be torn,
[39:35.000 --> 39:44.000]  limb from limb, slowly. You understand that you're going to wish you were torn limb from limb when they're done with you.
[39:44.000 --> 39:56.000]  And the high priest of this thing, when it goes through, you are going to be the most absolutely slow tortured, slow roasted, not going to have to wait to go to hell when you die, folks.
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  It's going to all happen right here if this thing comes through. And I'm going to tell you, it's like we're a city that's been infiltrated.
[40:01.000 --> 40:09.000]  That's what the human soul, the human family, the conditions like, that's what the country's like as below, so above to use the Illuminati's term.
[40:09.000 --> 40:22.000]  What you see happening at the low level is happening at the high level. And literally all we've been infested by so far is the, is the, is the, is the vanguard, the, the special forces of evil.
[40:22.000 --> 40:38.000]  The main army, ladies and gentlemen, is blowing down the main gates right now. The gates are falling and we see shining through it. Lucifer and all the hell hordes coming through the breach to literally manifest through people, pure evil.
[40:38.000 --> 40:45.000]  You can see it beginning and the gates are going down, folks, and hell is beginning to pour in right now.
[40:45.000 --> 40:53.000]  The cancer rates, your families, your children, everything, you're going to lose everything, ladies and gentlemen. You're going to lose the prosperity, everything.
[40:53.000 --> 41:02.000]  I mean, the host of hell, ladies and gentlemen, have blown big holes in the main gate and it is pouring in. They're attacking those of us trying to keep the gate up.
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.000]  The gate is falling right now. The gate is going down right now. Do you understand that?
[41:09.000 --> 41:17.000]  The churches are all announcing Catholic Protestant, turn your guns in, do whatever you want. Abortion's good.
[41:17.000 --> 41:26.000]  Open the borders up. I mean, it's just all happening. It's all beginning. And again, image that gate with big blast holes in it, folks.
[41:26.000 --> 41:34.000]  And just evil is reaching its arm through and just reaching at those of us that are resisting it.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  Image big, fiery, degenerate arms dripping with the blood of the innocents reaching through the gates.
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  It's already gotten the innocent. It's already gotten the little children. It's already gotten the third world people.
[41:45.000 --> 41:51.000]  Now it's shaking the gates. It's shaking the gates to bring down Christendom, what's left of it.
[41:51.000 --> 41:57.000]  Just because your ancestors were Christian, you're going to be destroyed. There's no ever any quarter with this.
[41:57.000 --> 42:05.000]  It's just shaking the iron gate. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in. And the gates falling because our morals are falling.
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  And it's just trying to ram those iron bars off the door. Let me in. Let me in. Let me in.
[42:11.000 --> 42:17.000]  Don't question. There is no evil. I will give you freedom. Open the gate. Open the gate. Open the gate.
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  Just ramming with big battering ramps. Satan's arms like battering ramps.
[42:21.000 --> 42:28.000]  Let me in. Let me in. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.000]  That's what it is, folks. It's a hammer. Hammer. Hammer. Hammer. Hammer.
[42:33.000 --> 42:40.000]  You're under attack from every level. You turn on Nickelodeon. They're teaching five-year-olds how to have sex.
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  Again, to destroy their innocence, ladies and gentlemen, only pure evil does that.
[42:45.000 --> 42:52.000]  We have Guciardi. Is he ready? Bring him in. I'm going to be reporting news here, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:52.000 --> 43:03.000]  It's just to realize the magnitude of the total panoptagonic grid designed to absolutely corner us scientifically
[43:03.000 --> 43:12.000]  and just incrementally with actuaries and algorithms and systems of control incinerates humanity.
[43:12.000 --> 43:19.000]  You go to infowars.com. Exclusive. Snowden-level. Documents reveal stealth DHS spy grid.
[43:19.000 --> 43:26.000]  Major leaked documents on how these tie into the state. The feds tracking you with face scanning cameras, audio sensors,
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.000]  data miners, just like the Google cars with the codes, so the NSA can be right there.
[43:31.000 --> 43:39.000]  It even says, even if your camera is turned off or your phone's turned off, it hammers in and steals all the data.
[43:39.000 --> 43:46.000]  And then we continue here with the articles, DHS funds installation of white boxes that can track population of entire city.
[43:46.000 --> 43:52.000]  That's Paul Watson's article up on DrudgeReport.com. Once these stories went out yesterday and today,
[43:52.000 --> 43:58.000]  we then got a confirmed contact. We separately confirmed the authenticity of the documents.
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  You can call the numbers. You can talk directly to the officers over this. They get very upset.
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.000]  We have the document, just like when I got the DHS document five years ago that said the founders were terrorists
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  and Paul was bad and the Tea Party was bad and the enemy of Homeland Security.
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.000]  People didn't believe it. I called the phone number. They got very threatening at the FBI.
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.000]  And then, of course, a week later, people had to admit it was a real document.
[44:20.000 --> 44:30.000]  This is a real document. DHS is putting in these systems that absolutely are like smart meters on your house but more powerful.
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.000]  You can go to infowars.com and see a photo of one of these systems.
[44:35.000 --> 44:40.000]  It's also on prisonplanet.com. But, again, separately, they've got the IntelliStreets going in
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  and they admit it analyzes voices with voice prints and tracks you.
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.000]  It's all part of the same grid. You've got hundreds of big companies flooding in with lobbyists
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.000]  and putting former government people on their boards to just get hundreds of billions a year of your money
[44:55.000 --> 45:01.000]  to build this electronic prison that they also fry you with all the electromagnetic radiation with.
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.000]  So there's also the health issue. You see, anything they give you, any device, is a trojan horse.
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  It's not that technology's bad. It's that they have trojan-horsed it.
[45:10.000 --> 45:16.000]  Just like Kinect can look up to 1,000 feet through more than seven walls, including brick walls,
[45:16.000 --> 45:22.000]  and map everything down to just microscopic measurements, more human than human.
[45:22.000 --> 45:30.000]  Its scan can see every pore on your skin through multiple walls when the human eye couldn't see the pores at 50 feet.
[45:30.000 --> 45:35.000]  It's high-def beyond your eyes looking through your walls when you're on the toilet,
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.000]  when you're in bed with your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend or whatever.
[45:39.000 --> 45:48.000]  Kinect is there like a Cylon Raider watching everything you're doing and sending it back to Microsoft on record.
[45:48.000 --> 45:56.000]  Just like everything else is on record. Just like we told you they were using the wireless chips you get in cars
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.000]  to go through toll roads. Now they admit nationwide that's been tracked for decades and is in an NSA database.
[46:01.000 --> 46:06.000]  Just like they put black boxes on all the cars and made you pay for them that are wireless systems to begin taxing you.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  They're just beware Greeks bearing gifts. Here's your car.
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  Thousands of dollars added to the price of tech to track and rape you.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  And it's all being announced. It's all coming. It's all here. It's all hellish.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  And these boxes are going in nationwide. That's the next big breaking news.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  Those stinking things are in Austin. And I had cops one time when they were here.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  One of them shoot their mouth off to me. Oh, you don't know half of them.
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.000]  I go, what? The boxes? The license plate readers? You don't think I don't know? You quietly put all those in?
[46:34.000 --> 46:37.000]  What do you think I am? An idiot? And I love how these people think because they're part of the system.
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.000]  They're going to be safe. Hey, cops like this. Eat some more GMO. Drink some more fluoride.
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  Give your kid all the shots and you'll get to bury him early.
[46:44.000 --> 46:48.000]  And I know you'll be there when your kid's dead at 15 saluting the government. You love it.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  You'll probably get off on your kid being dead. I mean, you love death. You're going to get a biggin.
[46:53.000 --> 46:58.000]  You're going to get everything you want from your master in triplicate.
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.000]  Now, Anthony Gucciardi breaking this with the amazing reporter.
[47:02.000 --> 47:07.000]  I know you've had in the last few years at StoryLeak.com and also working with you on your natural society site.
[47:07.000 --> 47:13.000]  But just great job getting this intel, confirming it. And this is confirmed.
[47:13.000 --> 47:17.000]  This has got me completely blown away because it just confirms everything.
[47:17.000 --> 47:21.000]  What is your breakdown on this information and explain to people what we're dealing with here?
[47:21.000 --> 47:28.000]  This will be a telling day for the media because if the media chooses not to cover this, it will be once and for all.
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  They are 100% irrelevant. This is massive news. This is a Snowden level leak.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  And this is 100% confirmed from a government source. It can actually be accessed from a government site.
[47:38.000 --> 47:44.000]  And we've found now that this domestic spy grid is a massive web of just a database.
[47:44.000 --> 47:53.000]  Everything you're doing, as you can see with some of these images, everything you're doing is being connected to this spy system grid sent back to the database
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.000]  and then also syndicated through this wireless mesh. And everyone in the media right now is talking about that.
[47:58.000 --> 48:03.000]  Those are the boxes that are tracking where you've been, the locations on your cell phone, the IP address, other information.
[48:03.000 --> 48:08.000]  But that's nothing compared to this. This shows what's actually happening from the government's mouth.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  The media was saying, the mainstream media, yeah, they're tracking everything. That's scary.
[48:12.000 --> 48:20.000]  But this, this is a whole other level. They're sending everything you do to the county sheriff's office, the state ferry, the port of Seattle,
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  all these headquarters, the fusion center, the Coast Guard, the police headquarters. It's all going there.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  And then they have this little...
[48:27.000 --> 48:32.000]  And see, there's the illusion the feds aren't involved and the fusion centers are fed run. So it's going right to Soran. Go ahead.
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  Everything you're doing is going to the fusion center. And it even has internet here, as if it's just a little big deal.
[48:37.000 --> 48:44.000]  The internet goes through the city backbone. We're talking about full implementation of all the camera systems, all the snooping songs.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  And guys, scroll through it. Show them the photos, show them the systems, show them their own documents.
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.000]  This is a massive PDF. We've yet to even extract most of it. It's just bragging about it.
[48:53.000 --> 49:00.000]  The image I have printed out here is of actually a tracking system on a lamppost, you know, the IntelliStreet deal.
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  This is part of that system. And they have it here. We didn't put emphasis on it ourselves. It's actually...
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  That's on page nine for folks that want to see.
[49:07.000 --> 49:13.000]  Page nine. They already emphasized it with a box saying, you know, this is the tracking system that we're implementing into this grid.
[49:13.000 --> 49:21.000]  And this is happening in pretty much every major city. Just Seattle now is so insane. They've published this in their document saying that, yeah, we'll do this.
[49:21.000 --> 49:27.000]  And this has been since last February. So this isn't even new. This has been going on. All these cities are doing this.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  But now they're implementing it. It's a giant spider web across the entire nation.
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.000]  A giant spider web and it's all integrated into the system.
[49:35.000 --> 49:40.000]  And here I can show TV viewers just right off this. Here you go, folks. Document cam that. People can see that.
[49:40.000 --> 49:47.000]  They had DHS cameras on the outskirts of the port and they were saying, oh, we're looking for terrorists, you know, ships and everything like that.
[49:47.000 --> 49:53.000]  Then they were caught turning the cameras in on the city to watch the citizens in their private homes.
[49:53.000 --> 49:57.000]  When the DHS said it was for terrorists, we are the terrorists.
[49:57.000 --> 50:04.000]  Now, this is a criminal takeover. Again, the government runs al-Qaeda. They staged the attacks in 99 there with Delta Force to blame the peaceful protesters.
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.000]  Anywhere you call liberal is always the most tyrannical because they're not really liberals. It's their fascist cover.
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  I've had the former police chief on to admit that and apologize on air.
[50:12.000 --> 50:22.000]  So that's what this is really all about is a takeover by these foreign banks. The police are now being converted to pure soldiers to go after us.
[50:22.000 --> 50:29.000]  Yeah, this was initiated on February 21st, 2012, per Section 39 of the contract. This is the contract signature. Everything's on here.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  Mikhail Fallin was the one who found this from Storyleak, one of the writers.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  Well, he received it from a whistleblower.
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  Yeah, received it from the whistleblower and he was the one who said, hey, you know, we got to cover this.
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.000]  Called me early this morning and I've just been sifting through the PDF document and I've just been trying to make.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  And it's called the mesh system because it grabs all your data and then integrates it into the database in your file.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[50:49.000 --> 50:55.000]  So it is illegal because if you, without somebody's authorization, grab their data, that is hacking.
[50:55.000 --> 51:21.000]  This is what Google cars did, squared. This is what the Google cars did, total criminality.
[51:26.000 --> 51:34.000]  All in one filter element. It is the only one that does it and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[51:34.000 --> 51:45.000]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilic acid,
[51:45.000 --> 51:51.000]  the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  You could buy three survival seed vaults for less than one of theirs.
[53:27.000 --> 53:34.000]  The survival seed vault from mypatriotsupply.com includes detailed planting and seed saving instructions in ship same day.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  Plus all orders over $49 ship free.

[54:00.000 --> 54:20.000]  It's so incredible to see how the establishment is using our money, our labor and the incredible technological systems that have been developed.
[54:20.000 --> 54:35.000]  Not to empower humanity and uplift humanity, but to build a high tech wireless grid to poison us and fry us and wreck our DNA on record while they are building their new world.
[54:35.000 --> 54:43.000]  And all the little minions, notice the NSA and the media play along with the fact they've been spying on us forever illegally.
[54:43.000 --> 54:50.000]  Notice how the power structure, you know, denied basically everything.
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.000]  And then now we learn as a group, governments been acting criminally together to violate everyone's rights.
[54:56.000 --> 55:06.000]  It's like red light cameras have been ruled illegal for about 20 years because under common law in the constitution, state constitutions, you got to have an officer there as a witness to write the citation.
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  They don't care if it's fraud. They just do it now.
[55:09.000 --> 55:15.000]  And that's a very small example, but the government is rogue. It's evil. It's run by offshore interest.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  It doesn't mean the people that work for it are all evil. They're all victims too.
[55:19.000 --> 55:28.000]  But when the victims then join through mass Stockholm syndrome, the globalists, you become accomplices.
[55:28.000 --> 55:37.000]  And I don't hate you as golem like victims of this, but you still are a minion of the New World Order.
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  You're still a minion, a pump, a sycophant of Beelzebub.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  And again, if you don't believe in God, whatever, this is the devil.
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.000]  Manifest the archetype, whatever you want to call it, Carl Jung, this is it.
[55:49.000 --> 55:55.000]  Briefly, survival shield, nascent iodine is back in, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:55.000 --> 56:04.000]  This is the only place you can get it, totally proprietary using sound wave technology patented with Russian scientists, totally proprietary National Institutes of Health.
[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  And I went to the research, the best thing for my family, my thyroid.
[56:08.000 --> 56:12.000]  And it's just done so much for me personally. You've seen the rave reviews.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  This is simply amazing and it's helping fund our free speech operations.
[56:17.000 --> 56:24.000]  So go to infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-2533139.
[56:24.000 --> 56:31.000]  Now, the laboratory expanded to put out more, but there was a holdup in the latest manufacturing process.
[56:31.000 --> 56:37.000]  And so I thought we wouldn't have any more delays, but we have enough right now.
[56:37.000 --> 56:41.000]  If you order in the next few days, be able to ship it right out to you in a matter of days.
[56:41.000 --> 56:49.000]  It's going to sell out. Probably again, it'll be back ordered a week or so again, but we're trying to get to where we have enough for it's never back ordered infowarslife.com.
[56:49.000 --> 56:57.000]  You also get the modifier on brown seaweed infowarslife.com that has some of the same properties in it as well.
[56:57.000 --> 57:05.000]  And some of the other products are also available at infowarsstore.com at your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[57:05.000 --> 57:12.000]  Anthony Goodsharty, I want to continue with you into the next hour. I've kind of settled down a bit right now with this big breaking news, but we have the contracts.
[57:12.000 --> 57:18.000]  We have the city of Seattle. We have DHS. We have the phone numbers. We have what they're doing, the names of who's involved.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  What are you going to cover when we come back in the next hour?
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  Well, specifically, we're going to cover the fact that this whole contract here is open source now. We can look at all of this.
[57:27.000 --> 57:38.000]  They're paying people $60,000, $80,000 total of $2.6 million from the DHS to set up this whole entire spider grid, this web of spy intel.
[57:38.000 --> 57:47.000]  And we're talking about direct access to the headquarters of the police department, direct access for this wireless mesh system to track what you're doing.
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.000]  I see that. I'll show people on TV. I mean, this is all confirming DHS, your money. Here it is right here.
[57:53.000 --> 58:02.000]  Taxpayer dollars used to spy on you. And again, they had the cameras. They said they were for terrorists for the port and they were turning them in, watching people in their private homes.
[58:02.000 --> 58:07.000]  I mean, this is what this has come down to. And this isn't just happening in Seattle. It's happening across the entire globe.
[58:07.000 --> 58:13.000]  It's happening specifically in the United States. But this is just we found these documents for Seattle. We're going to expose more in the future as well.
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.000]  And see if the kleptocratic media will report on it.
[58:16.000 --> 58:21.000]  Yeah, it just shows they won't, most likely, and they're just so irrelevant now. They're so dead that no one even...
[58:21.000 --> 58:27.000]  Well, that's like the Esquire writer. He was a real journalist, so he didn't believe Delta 4 Stage, the attacks in Seattle and all that.
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.000]  And he went and found the news. He goes, wow, you actually told the truth. And then he flipped over and woke up and wrote a positive article.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  So they buried it at the back. And he got a bunch of heat over.
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  Why? We're all just want to live in a free country. Stand together, folks.
[58:39.000 --> 58:46.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:09.000 --> 59:13.000]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[59:16.000 --> 59:22.000]  Nascent iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[59:22.000 --> 59:26.000]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[59:26.000 --> 59:34.000]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nascent iodine exclusively available at InfowarsLife.com.
[59:34.000 --> 59:40.000]  Nascent iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[59:40.000 --> 59:48.000]  Survival Shield nascent iodine. Secure your super high quality nascent iodine today at InfowarsLife.com.
[59:48.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, notice that the Snowden documents have brought much of the globalist takeover to a standstill.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  If we can force the dinosaur media to cover this, or at least the new media to cover it, this could be one of the biggest stories.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Anthony was just saying this during the break and I was like, yes, I agree with you.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  The biggest stories ever, and quite frankly, I don't care about having the biggest story ever.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  It's about breaking something that some Hollywood stars had on my show.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  That is like cotton candy high. That's like a sugar high.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  I want big, juicy, ribeye, finest aged beef with a fully loaded baked potato here and a side of asparagus.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  That's what we're all about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  We want the real deal.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  First of all, we're a major news source worldwide because folks know we make mistakes every once in a while, but we break big bombshell stuff.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  We don't put out fake documents. We report real stuff.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  And even when you're trying to tell the truth all the time as a journalist, you mess up.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  I am an analyst and a liberty lover who rabble rouses for freedom.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  I wear many hats, but I've got journalists like Anthony Gucciardi and Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson and Adon Salazar and Kit Daniels and David Knight and Leigh Ann McAdoo
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  and Jakari Jackson and Gigi Ernetta and Rob Dew and Steve Watson and Paul's wife who wishes to be unnamed because she's been harassed living in the free country of England over being a part of the thing.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  I mean, this is serious business, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  And all the rest of the crew, the crew back there I haven't mentioned, this is the real deal.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  And you, the listeners standing right beside us, not behind us, beside us.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  We're making history together and we're redesigning Info Wars and Prison Planet.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  Prison Planet will be redesigned the next few weeks, a little bit behind, but it's coming.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  That's what Info Wars is going to look like. We're going to beta test on Prison Planet.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  We've got the studio almost done. It's just hard to work 16 hours a day and then get everything new done.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  Then the fight to get the funding to fund things, but you've been supporting us, it's starting to happen.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  And I've got to think DrudgeReport.com.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  Drudge has more courage and more instinct for what's hardcore real news than Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, WorldNet Daily all rolled up into one.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Who I'm saying, you know, Glenn Beck's doing a pretty good job now.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  WorldNet Daily does a great job and breaks a lot of big stuff.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  It's just that, and Drudge helps those guys get their news out. We're all in this together.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  And people say, Rush Limbaugh, what do you mean he's a good guy?
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  Well, he's getting more hardcore talking about false flags now.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  We need to be ready to win and take the culture over for liberty again.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Liberty's sexy. Liberty's cool. We don't have to lose and just think the globalists are all powerful.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  We have to act like winners. We are winners.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  And I always knew this, Anthony, instinctively, that historically if you fight tyranny and have courage, you will turn the tide.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  But now I see the fruit bearing.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  We can kick the new old orders butt and get a reprieve for this nation like none of the God.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  We don't have to have all this come through now. We can save another generation.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  What do you think?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  No, we're all on the same side with this.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  We're all living in or near these cities where they're just tracking us 24-7, reporting the data to the police for stuff that's not even illegal,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  reporting the data to the DHS.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  I mean, we've seen things time and time again just for one example to bring up back when we were going to the NSA in Utah.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  A guy behind the counter had mentioned to us that there was some bomb threat he heard about on the plane.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  And we just, you know, I was concerned about it.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  So I said, you know, I heard that guy mentioned there was a bomb threat.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  Because they'd had a drill.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Because they'd had a drill recently.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  And there was also a bomb threat in Los Angeles quite a while ago in September.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  And they drug him away.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  Yeah, they went and they took him and they just took him away.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  No questions asked.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Just took him away.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  And they got threatened to you as well just for reporting it.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  Yeah.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  And he said, hey, if you don't give your source up, you know, we're going to take you away.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  You're going to be arrested too.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  That's a felony.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  And again, it was an old man running a sandwich shop.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Old guy.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  And it turned out there had been some kind of drill.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  He just said, hey, better ask him something's going on.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Look like a bomb threat.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  Boom, jail.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  Yep.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  And you said the giant marshals and folks like love that he was panicked and crying.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  It was they were getting off on dragging an old man away who just did normal free speech.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  And that's what they're saying.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  You laugh at us.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  We're going to arrest you.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  They want to drag you away.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  Well, yeah, it's like in Philadelphia when the average person is seen as an enemy combatant
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  because they actually do deal with some crazy people on average.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  And that has deluded them to this point where they are super troopers and we are the enemy.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  That's right.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  It came out that police now see the public under DHS as quote insurgents.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Period.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  That's it.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  We are the enemy.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  And this whole system is designed to attack and track the enemy.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Stay there.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  We're going to walk through the PDF page one right through it, breaking info wars.com,
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  prison planet.com and story leak.com.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  Alex Jones here.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  And I want to tell you about a long time friend of the show, my patriot supply.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  values as their fellow patriots.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  My patriot supply brings us their exclusive patriot pantry brand along with many other
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  fine preparedness products.

[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  And out of all the titles we've carried one stands out because it is just so chillingly
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  convincing and that's dreams from my real father by Joel Gilbert available at infowars.com.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Don't forget your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  You'll also find at infowarshop.com.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  We're also carrying behind the green mask.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  You in agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  The greater good, the most professional and up to date film I've ever seen exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  These titles and a lot more are all available at infowarshop.com.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  Your plans, your number, your eyes, your schedule, your desktop, your details, your life.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  So us, your children, your thoughts.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  Adam Freeland, legendary DJ, brainless in.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  There is a scientific technological tyranny, a technocracy in their own words.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  Being put in the tracks.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  Everything you buy, sell, do tracks your voice where you walk an entire record of it.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  Designed to give that advanced breakaway civilization level, omnipresent, almost godlike awareness to the criminal technocrats.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  Who run Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and all the other big mega banks who have the high frequency trading that cheats the stock market.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  It's all just a way to absolutely screw you and your family.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  They write the regulations to shut down all their competition on record to where you can't operate.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  You go about how will people buy their products?
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  No, no, no.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  The takeover is only to make you dependent to then carry out the eugenics population program and the population reduction program to say there are all these poor people.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  I'm middle class.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Kill the old people.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  Kill the poor.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  But then later you're going to be wiped out as well.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  It's all been wargamed and what you're hearing here is deep 20 years of research, 18 years on air, the absolute cutting edge of what's happening.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  Most people that work for the system are compartmentalized.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  They just do the job.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  They'll watch a football game after that or go to the topless bar or whatever.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  We literally are immersed in studying the enemy operations and they declare us free humanity as the enemy.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Anthony Gutierrez is here with us now coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  Robert Mazur, high level, former government investigator for the DEA who helped bring down some of the big money laundering globalist banks is going to be joining us for about 10, 15 minutes.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  Larry Clemens popping in with big breaking news and ways to impeach Obama, which there are moves now in the house to impeach begin the impeachment proceedings on the attorney general.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  And then James O'Keefe with bombshell breaking news where the new acorn groups that are going to run the Obamacare navigator systems.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  He went in just like he did four years ago with Acron and said, hey, I want to run underage prostitutes.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  You're going to help me.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  Oh, sure, we'll help you.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  Well, this time he went in and they admit, oh, well, we don't tell folks what really happens under Obamacare.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  So that breaking video and breaking info is at info wars.com.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  It's also on the project Veritas.com site.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  It's the top link on drudge report.com on the left hand, right hand top corner.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  Now, if you go down to the middle column, there's an info wars report on Rudge.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  Homeland funds installation of white boxes that contract population of entire city.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  Now we've confirmed that with a leak inside the government.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  I won't say state or city.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  That's one of the two in Seattle.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  This is hooked into Homeland Security exclusive Snowden level documents reveal stealth DHS spy grid.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  And to calmly go through exactly what this does is Anthony Guciardi who helped break this report for info wars.com with Mikhail Thalen.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  And so he joins us now.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Explain to people why this is so big and why it's key.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  Everyone get these reports out to everyone they know that are red linked up on info wars.com.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  Because this is even bigger when you look at it.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  This proves it's pointed at us.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  The cameras point in people's houses that's come out.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  This is so huge and it shows Homeland Security rolling something out that would be the most fabulous dream of the East German Stasi.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  Exactly.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  So just to give you a level of understanding on this, the media has absolutely been freaking out because they've found in the mainstream reports that some of these
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  in tele-street cameras in Seattle, some of these tracking systems were not only just taking the IP and MAC addresses of the cell phone users,
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  but tracking the last 1000 places they had been through GPS data.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  And that was interesting enough and they were freaking out about it saying it's anti-constitutional and everything like that.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  But now we've found an actual contract.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  This is a contract signed off, authorized, everything like that from the government, leaked from the government to us from an unknown name source.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  And we have found that not only do they track your information in your address, which I have it in plain writing here,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  but they're using these mesh mounting arm systems attached to street lamps, which you can see if you're viewing right now on Prison Planet TV.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  But it's basically a mega camera system that is interlocking in with this massive database that goes to not only fusion centers,
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  but the Coast Guard, the police headquarters, the sheriff's office.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  I'm going to read an excerpt here about specifically what this is doing in this contract again for $2.6 million from the DHS using your taxpayer money.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  And this is going on across the nation in all cities.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  But this is just the one we found.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  It says Internet connectivity.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  We have a presence in the western building, which enables us to provide a direct fiber internet solution for the police headquarters in the Seattle Municipal Tower.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  This will allow nearly limitless thorough potential for future expansion and can be configured in minutes should more bandwidth be needed in an emergency situation.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  They're talking about real time tracking of everything you are doing to the police at any given time.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  That means you're walking down the street.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  And guess what?
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  Here's another page.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  12 of the PDF is called network management.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  It says it also collects information about every Wi-Fi client accessing the network.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  And that's that's actually misleading because you walk by now and it just accesses your phone.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  That was even in the mainstream reports.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  People just walking by with their cell phone and seeing this Wi-Fi service try to access it, including its MAC address IP address signal intensity data rate and traffic status.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  Additional features include a fault management system for issuing alarms and logging events according to a set of customizable rules along with centralized and version controlled remote updating of the mesh operating system software.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  That means in certain cases, whenever they want, they can take absolutely anything they want from your cell phone at any time.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  It says according to a set of customizable filtering rules, they're allowed also allowed to issue alarms and log events.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  So you're walking by these massive tracking systems, which are also shown.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  They're called the Cyclone Outdoor Mesh Mounting Arm.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  And the system goes in there.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  It's the mesh network that tracks everything you're doing.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  They're tracking your IP address.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  So the mainstream media was saying, are they doing it?
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  This shows yes.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  They're not only tracking that.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  Where you are, what you can do and anything else they want because it's completely custom.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  And then they're sending it to a fusion center, a police headquarters, the King County Sheriff's Office is just going everywhere.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  And then to the feds because that's who controls it is the fusion center.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  And let me just add one point to this, Anthony.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  The media only one newspaper reported this or one TV station.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  Last two days, we reported it.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  And then once we reported it and once we broke it down, a drudge picked it up.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  So it's gone nationwide, but they are like halfway denying it out there.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  Now this confirms it's pointed at everybody.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  It's tracking everything you do.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  It's grabbing your data, just like the Google cars did illegally.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  That's the reason this is definitely illegal just like the NSA spying.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  This goes right back to the NSA.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  The feds paid for this.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  This is the new physical NSA grid on the ground.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  This is huge.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  When this came out, they were trying this in England.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  Five years ago, they had to remove it.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  There were parliament investigations, resignations in England that is the king of this.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  So let's see if this becomes a big deal.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  Four of the media attacks us and says, how dare you not like this?
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  Let's see what the media says to this.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  Let's see what the government has to say about this.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  I mean, if they completely ignore this, it'll blow my mind.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  I mean, they were reporting on the tracking of your locations acting like it was some big thing.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  In comparison, that's a sea turtle.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  Now we're looking at the megalodon.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  I mean, this is a one billion pound gorilla.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  This is a complete assimilation of all your data into private databases that only the government can access.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  Everything you're doing, you'll last 1,000 locations.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  I mean, this is worse in many ways because the NSA is coming in and they're also tracking what you're doing.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  Now we're having city-wide tracking.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  I mean, there's so many private databases that are going into this.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Oh, and look at the Austin police chief who is fed on record.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  I mean, absolutely with Obama to get turning your guns all nine yards.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:15.000]  These come in just like Boston, New York did first and said, we want the businesses to wire in with your microphones and cameras into us.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  And insurance companies are saying they'll give you discounts.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  Now they're trying in New York and other areas to make you do it.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  So again, nothing against cameras if you have them yourself.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  The point is they're going to make you opt into their grid.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  Again, this is unbelievable.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  But it actually, yeah, it actually goes beyond cameras though.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  They don't even need those anymore.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  They use smart trash cans in Las Vegas to track everything you've done on your cell phone.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  And this is saying that they could basically track.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  That's right. They have new manhole covers going in in New York that actually are actually wireless grids and they're tracking everything.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.000]  And then all the RFID in your products, that's being scanned now in Miami in London is coming to Austin.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  They scan all the RFID and then give you taxes on what you threw away.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  It's all for predictable programming as well.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  If they can know the last 1000 locations of 95% of the population, they can predict what they're doing.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  And then they make you pay in all the products for the RFID chips that are in them.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  Exactly.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  And all the new pills are going to come out with chips in them.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  And the cell phones, you also have to pay for the tracking software and technology that's embedded in those.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  But what's interesting is, you know, we've always seen the mainstream reports on this.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  We've always heard, you know, yeah, they're doing it, but we've never actually seen outside of a Snowden leak.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  The government say, yeah, we're doing this, we're tracking everything you do with these massive new cameras that don't even...
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  And again, they told the local TV station and stuff, oh, it's just for police to communicate.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  They lied.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  So it's illegal.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  They lied.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]  This is a huge story.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  Is America a dead frog?
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  They'll just sit there in the boiling water and take it?
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  Are we going to get upset about this?
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  That's the real question.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  Are all the listeners right now going to share this article, get the word out, demand their local news cover, demand that CNN covered this?
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  Or are we just going to sit there and say, yeah, you can track us.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  They lie on record and say it was not a big deal.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000]  When here it says, yes, it's to track every single thing you do.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  Your IP address, MAC address, signal intensity, data rate, traffic, everything.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  And it's customizable to even do it.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  And then of course it does double as a police high death video audio communication grid.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  And you know they can broadcast off these now.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  That's in all the new patents and all the new iPhones and droids.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  A kill switch to turn off your phone so you can't videotape.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  And it even just says internet here.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  This is so broad spectrum, internet, and then it says wireless mesh.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  It's all connected.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  City backbone, it says.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  So all the cameras are feeding into this.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  And you can bet, I would bet a million dollars, every major city has this.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  Oh no, no, it's already gone in Austin.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]  But I've already gone out and done reports.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  There's the spy grid, picking up all your traffic.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  And then you talk to the police.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  They're so into the fact that they only know.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  Doesn't matter if it's criminal.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  Well, we're the good guys.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  It's for your own good.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  Pure bull, it's for the narcotics, trafficking, child kidnapping, murdering globalists.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  I want to come back and finish up with this bombshell.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  And we've got a special guest popping in.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  But we need to point out in the article those points that they lied and this is illegal.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  Nacin Iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  It's made right here in the USA completely non-GMO.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of nasin iodine exclusively available at InfraWarsLife.com.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  Nacin iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:04.400]  My name is Frank Bates and I got a confession to make.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.280]  Just a few days ago, FEMA went directly to my supplier and tried to buy up my entire
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.880]  stockpile of high quality survival food.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:16.440]  It sounds crazy, but I'll show you the exact letter they sent in a minute.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.320]  Revealing FEMA's plot could land me in hot water and I think you deserve to know exactly
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.680]  what they're doing.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.880]  Go to FEMAHatesThis.com to see undeniable video proof that the government is on the
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:32.400]  hunt for as much survival food as they can grab in 24 hours.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:38.480]  Be warned, it's really disturbing because the fact is FEMA must know something we don't.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.840]  Go to FEMAHatesThis.com to see why survival food is the number one item to hoard right
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:49.560]  now and why supplies are so low or even completely sold out already at many stores across America.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:55.520]  Do it now because I don't know how long it will be online, so go to FEMAHatesThis.com
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.080]  while you can.

[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:38.480]  It's happened to us.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:41.840]  We got cancer and the cancer is growing going.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:42.840]  No.

[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.340]  What's wrong?
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:53.720]  Here's the articles up at infowars.com.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:00.360]  NSA head argues government secrecy is the same as personal privacy. Survey NSA Stasi
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:05.960]  state Cal's journalist into self censorship. Then we've got Selena Gomez putting out videos
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:10.160]  where it's great and sexy to be grown by the TSA. Gee wonder if that was paid for. I mean
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.680]  just look how we're immersed in propaganda. The big exclusive Snowden level documents
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.240]  reveal stealth DHS spy grid. I would add on the streets of America are on the street.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.800]  I mean this is this is unbelievable. We can't come up with headlines bad enough is the problem.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:30.840]  House voted to get banksters back in derivatives business. Yeah, I gotta accelerate that fraud.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:36.520]  DHS funds installation of white boxes that contract population of entire city. That's the
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:42.880]  part one that Gucci Arties article along with Thaylin is part two and we'll continue to track this.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.720]  Anthony is going to be on the nightly news tonight. We should probably shoot right at the end of the
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:51.120]  show. An emergency boil down to the latest on this just puts in a couple minute report for
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:56.800]  folks separately to go in this article. But the only place the story is getting out is info wars
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.440]  dot com drudge report dot com is linked to our story. God bless the great folks over there that
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:06.120]  want to live in a free society. How dare them is very extreme. I do not want giant spy grid
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:11.400]  stealing all your dad off your phone. It's so incredible. But Anthony gives you already other
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:16.640]  points that need to be made about the magnitude of this because remember they've lied and said,
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.560]  oh, it's just a police communication system. And then we have a what is 100 page document with
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:27.120]  everything it's doing. That is how we defeat them. The fact they lied about it is we can just
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.760]  because it's illegal. They have to lie. We can eviscerate that. Yeah, they have to lie about
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.360]  it. This just reminds me though. I mean, this is just deep in layers here. We're already living in
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:41.360]  a constitution for his own as admitted by the DHS. They declared in 2011 anyone with him within
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.400]  100 miles of the border, which includes the ocean doesn't have a fourth amendment and they can take
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.360]  out your laptop or anything with no reason. No search warrant and they can throw you in jail if
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:55.560]  they find anything. And the ACLU tried to sue over that and they said, okay, we'll review it. We'll
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.800]  review it. And then years later, they said the DHS reviewed itself and said that it's okay because
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.200]  it's on the border. So already if you live in places like Houston or LA, you don't have a fourth
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.200]  amendment. You get within 100 miles of the Texas border. They just let the illegals come right by
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.520]  in front of you. And the board patrol writes people tickets drinking beer at their campsite.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.360]  No, but by definitely, I mean, if they see Americans Hispanic, black, white, no matter they run over,
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:20.160]  go up against the thing. Oh, got beer in here. I'm ratting you ticket. Where's he legal? Just
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:25.080]  walking by you got it on video. They're just like, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Wired covered it by
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:30.240]  definition. 100 miles from the border is a constitution for his own. That is law. That is
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.320]  federal law under the DHS. Now you have this. They have a they have a they have a global, a
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:38.840]  domestic. How this works is they have the constitution free zones along the border,
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.360]  which is mostly every major city. 200 is something, you know, 100 every time I drive one of these
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.280]  checkpoints, it's 100 miles in. They want to search my vehicle and they can legally the DHS
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:52.000]  federally, you know, not legally actually under the constitution, but on under their own law,
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.480]  they can search you without a warrant or any suspicion whatsoever. Make sure you're not
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.760]  shipping in drugs that they're supposed to get a cut of. Oh, you're giving them justification. They
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.960]  have no justification. They just say we can do it. They don't even have a reason and they review
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.000]  themselves. And then now we have the NSA, of course, they're coming in doing, you know,
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.200]  watching everything that we do on a federal level. But this, this is the crux of it here. If we
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:16.440]  can defeat this, we might be able to defeat the whole system. They are now saying time is of
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:21.000]  the essence in this document. The city has an immediate need to implement this system and
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.640]  software equipment from the management and operation of the city as in tracking of the
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.040]  whole city. Therefore, time is of the essence in all matters relating to this contract. They
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.680]  are desperate. They need to get this in before we defeat them. And they are and before they
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.240]  implode the economy, of course, and pose the saviors. And then when we go out and we riot,
[01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.040]  they can have all this stuff in play. They're getting their clowered and piven ready. Yeah,
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:44.400]  exactly. But this is a whole new level because it's city-wide. It's not even, it's not even at a
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.800]  state level. They're doing it so they have these separate layers of tracking that we just have
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.000]  to bust their own. They have the federal. Well, that's why they admit they're putting highway
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.080]  dividers where there's a hundred yards between the highway. They're putting an admitting to control
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.240]  flows so you can't escape. They're building a prison around us and literally locking and
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:05.280]  loading and strutting around bugging their eyes out. I mean, the government is a criminal group.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:10.080]  It's a contingency plan because if the federal level fails, then they have the state level.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.200]  And if the state level fails, they have the city level. And if that fails, they've got Google
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:18.320]  Barges. Exactly. And Google Satellites. The global level. So they have so many levels to this
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:21.760]  that they expect us to be able to defeat some of them. And then they have InfraGuard level with
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.680]  the corporations at the heart running the whole thing. Exactly. Yeah. With license to kill.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:31.200]  Everyone now. They have corporate heads licensed to kill. Just ready with weapons. We are the enemy.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:36.480]  They have cells everywhere. This is a total foreign takeover. These people are the traders.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:40.080]  They are the enemy, ladies and gentlemen, and they will stage terror attacks and blame it on us.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:45.120]  You can guarantee that. That's the number one program they've got left. And we're here exposing
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:49.280]  it. Thank you, Anthony Gutiarty. The stories are at infolwars.com, prisonplotter.com.

[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:05.440]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:10.640]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes,
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:17.600]  autism, and every other major disease? It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.440]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives. Our water is filled
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:29.120]  with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:34.160]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:40.640]  desperately needs. To learn more, visit infowarshealth.com. The site is literally packed with audio and

[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.160]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Scalzen. The U.S. isn't building huge underground
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:17.120]  bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat. They know that a massive nuclear attack
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:21.840]  is coming. They want that attack to come. Joel Scalzen is renowned as one of the world's
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:27.200]  foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home. What I tell people
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:32.160]  is that you do have time. We talk about natural disasters, the health environment, we talk about
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:36.880]  pollution, the water quality. My personal experience about being in every one of these states,
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:40.880]  most people won't even be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:47.360]  panic. There is no preparedness without strategy. This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:47.040]  Well, Robert Naser is our guest for the next 10, 15 minutes. Then I'm going to get into all the
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:53.280]  other news. I haven't covered yet and he was a federal agent for 27 years during five years
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.360]  of his law enforcement career. He was a long-term undercover agent operating in deep cover within
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.640]  the underworld as a high-level money launderer for senior members of the Columbia drug cartels.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:07.440]  Well, that's a dangerous job and it goes on. He not only dealt directly with cartel leaders,
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:11.600]  but also functioned as their conduit to corrupt international bankers around the world.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:18.080]  Is there any other kind of international banker? He is a court certified in both US and Canada as
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:23.200]  an expert in money laundering. Mr. Naser has been a significant contributor to news media outlets,
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:29.200]  New York Times, PBS, ABC, and others. He's got a book out breaking down what really happened
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.960]  with the drug cartels and he's one of the guys really credited with bringing down some of the
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:40.800]  biggest cartels and big banks that were laundering money. The new book is the infill trader and he
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.160]  joins us. Thanks for coming on, Robert. No, thank you very much. It's my pleasure.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.160]  Well, you've got the floor. Tell folks about your experience with the book covers, but
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.760]  currently we see a lot of the big banks caught laundering drug money and they don't even get
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:57.520]  in trouble. Are they going to get a tiny fine? Yeah, you know, it's terribly unfortunate that
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:01.040]  the Department of Justice has taken the position that they're going to just slap the hands of
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.800]  international banks that are very, very aggressively involved in laundering criminal proceeds.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.360]  There's plenty of examples, but we'll take the most recent one, which is HSBC,
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:14.560]  Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Corporation. It sounds like a far away bank, but it's not
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:20.720]  second largest bank in the world based in the UK, but they had 400 plus branches in the United
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:26.400]  States. They profess to be the world's bank. They are, and they also had quite a banking
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.120]  and do have quite a banking network in Mexico. And between the New York and the Mexican offices
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:37.120]  of HSBC, by their own admission, they committed a criminal offense in connection with their
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:43.120]  movement of nearly a billion dollars in drug proceeds for the Sinaloa cartel and the north
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.080]  of the Bayek cartel, those are the largest in Mexico and in Colombia. And they also admitted
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:54.400]  that they intentionally altered records and gave people information about how they could go about
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:01.360]  avoiding the economic sanctions that were imposed upon Iran and helped them to conduct
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:07.280]  business to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. I mean, those are just a few of the
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:14.400]  offenses that were admitted to by them. Your listeners can go to a Senate subcommittee report.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.440]  I think it's the best piece of information about just what HSBC did. And it's very similar to what
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:24.320]  many other banks, unfortunately, have done. And it's a subcommittee that's led by Senator Levin
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:30.080]  out of Michigan. So if you just Google Senator Levin HSBC subcommittee report, you'll get it
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:36.640]  the first 25, 30 pages is the executive summary. And if that doesn't make you sick by reading that,
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:42.720]  you can go on and read similar reports about banks like Wachovia, UBS, Credit Suisse,
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:47.600]  a standard charter, many I can go on and on about the different banks that have admitted
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:52.560]  criminal conduct. And yet they've had their hands left by our Department of Justice claiming
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:37:01.360]  that there are loopholes in the law that made it impossible for them to focus a criminal charge
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.240]  on an individual bank officer, not just at HSBC, but many of these other banks.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:12.880]  Nothing could be further from the truth. The Money Wandering Control Act, which was enacted in 1986,
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.280]  has been a very, very effective tool for law enforcement to go after people who are involved
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:22.880]  in Money Wandering. What they don't do that they should be doing is something that has been the
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.640]  subject of articles that I've written that have been published in The New York Times and other
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:35.280]  media outlets. Why we don't do these things is something that I'm glad to see Senator Elizabeth
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:41.680]  Warren from Massachusetts has taken a lot of interest in. Another thing well worth your listeners
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:46.480]  doing if they want to get the latest information about this type of conduct within the international
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:54.720]  banking world is to go and Google Elizabeth Warren, HSBC, YouTube, and there are four or five
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:59.440]  different YouTube clips that are out there about her grilling the leaders of the regulatory and
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:06.800]  law enforcement agencies about just why they decided to hand slap these major banks, the
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:13.840]  Wall Street banks, and not prosecute any of the individuals at the banks. It's a startling thing
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:21.920]  to see her so effectively attacking them about, for example, asking them point blank, tell me the
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.320]  last time you've taken the biggest banks on Wall Street all the way to trial. They all looked at
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:31.280]  each other and nobody could offer an answer because they haven't. I thought another great
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.240]  question she asked was, in your opinion, how many billions of dollars do you have to launder for
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:42.640]  drug lords before somebody says, we're shutting you down, but $881 million isn't enough to the
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:48.000]  line is somewhere else further down the road. And I think one thing that should make this ring to
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:54.640]  all citizens is her point that if you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are you
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.360]  going to go to jail. And if it happens repeatedly, you may go to jail for the rest of your life,
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:04.720]  but evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.720]  sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:16.160]  And it's just not right. Robert Mazur is our guest. And of course, he is a bestselling author.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:21.920]  The new book is the infiltrator, the dash infiltrator.com. I mean, I know that they had
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:27.920]  hearings back in the nineties about the CIA and drug trafficking. I know Bloomberg reported a few
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:32.800]  years ago about 378 billion, not all of it drug money, but money they ran through and didn't look
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:38.800]  at on purpose. And they got like a hundred million dollar fine, a tiny fraction. That'd be like if
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.400]  I robbed a bank for a million and paid $3,000 fine for it. Most people would start robbing banks.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:49.520]  And the issue here is you look at Mexico destroyed by the drug war. I don't like drugs. I don't like
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:57.440]  the whole culture. But my issue is the drug war cannot be won because like prohibition with alcohol,
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:03.280]  that tripled the amount of alcohol, funded the mafia, corrupted the police. My issue though is we
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.680]  get rid of the drug war now. There's such a giant criminal network. What is it going to move on to?
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.240]  Kidnapping. We've seen that happen in Mexico. I mean, we, it seems like have set something in
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.680]  motion here and also American drug users have helped that is going to collapse the country in
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:22.640]  the end. What's your take on the whole state of the drug war and just how these banks are above
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:27.760]  the law? Well, first, some of the comments that you made there. Yes, I think that one of the
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:33.360]  things that this country needs to do is to take a very serious look in the mirror and admit something
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.160]  that I refuse to admit. When I was a law enforcement officer, I heard it all the time from a lot of
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.920]  Colombian traffickers and their comment was, you know, we wouldn't be bringing this stuff here if
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:48.560]  you guys weren't, if your citizens weren't demanding it, if there's no demand, there'll be no supply.
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.280]  And that's the truth. The other thing that you made mention of is, you know, we're not going to
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:58.400]  win the war on the supply side alone. And there's no doubt in my mind that I concur with that.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:03.600]  We have Colombian cartels. People begin to think that, well, do you, the Colombian cartels got under
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:08.640]  control and now we get this problem in Mexico? That's not true. The fact is that the cocaine
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:15.920]  that's fed to the Mexican cartels comes from the Colombian Peruvian and the Bolivian cartels,
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:22.320]  the Colombian cartels being at the head of the list. They have resources that are just unbelievable
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:31.120]  coming out of the Buenaventura area. There's been documented in law enforcement reports,
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:38.880]  roughly 60 some semi submersible submarines, which can transport 20,000 pounds of goods
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:45.600]  as illegal goods and has a four-man crew can stay semi submersible for five or four or five days.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:53.200]  They come in and feed the large shipments of drugs into Central America where nations are
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:42:01.360]  being as corrupted by the Mexican cartels as any. We have the same kind of problem going on
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:06.880]  through the European routes where the nations of West Africa have been corrupted, the leadership
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:13.840]  there to work with the cartels to take drugs up into the European area where that market is.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.760]  And the scary thing about all of that is well documented, something your listeners should
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:25.520]  look at. A case last named Juma, J-O-U-M-A-A, so just Google Juma and Drug Trafficking.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.600]  And you'll come up with a copy of an indictment and charts, clearly shows, and there's been
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:34.880]  several other cases before it that show the same thing, a very, very close working relationship
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:41.120]  between the Mexican cartels, the Colombian cartels, and Hezbollah. This has become a funding
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:47.920]  mechanism for Hezbollah and they are going to be involved in it as long as it exists because
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:52.000]  it's a very easy way for them to generate. Sure, sure. Robert Mazer is our guest best
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.640]  selling author, former DEA agent, 27 years, five years, infiltrating at the highest levels.
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:02.800]  Briefly, we've only got to go in a minute. What do you make of army soldiers being caught
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:07.280]  reportedly running hit teams on both sides of the border? I mean, here's what I'm getting at.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.680]  You've got the NSA and the DEA, as you know, is tied into the NSA stuff that's come out.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.640]  They know if you're talking on the telephone about buying a bag of marijuana or whatever,
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.400]  I mean, it gets picked up by the data snips. So all this is happening. And then meanwhile,
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:27.760]  I've gone on like trips before with my TV crew where I'm taking like six people for a week somewhere
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:32.720]  and I'll go to the bank to get $5,000 in case our credit cards sometimes get turned off and
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.960]  we're out of the country or something for a security alert. I need $5,000. The bank
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.800]  acts like I'm some kind of criminal, you know, all this stuff's going on with know your customer
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.160]  and they know what's going on. Everything with me, but they don't know what's going on with
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:54.240]  $500 billion a year. It's pure bull. The big banks run the policy. They've set it up where
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:59.280]  they're above the law. And so as you have exposed, so what do we do about that?
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:05.120]  Well, one of the things that really bothers me and I'm not suggesting that somebody's lining
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:10.160]  their pockets here, but I am suggesting that there's a clear appearance of an apparent conflict of
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:14.160]  interest by the decisions that have been made at the Department of Justice with regard to
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.800]  how these big banks have had their hands slapped. If you look at the two people principally involved
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:26.080]  in making this decision in HSBC and in other similar cases, they are Lanny Brewer, who was
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:31.280]  the chief of the criminal division and Eric Holder, his immediate boss, who's the attorney general.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:36.800]  Now, both of those guys were partners together in a law firm called Covington and Burling before
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:40.720]  they came to the Department of Justice. Covington and Burling, a law firm based in Washington,
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:47.040]  represents the loser of banking. I don't quite understand how or why we wouldn't have enough
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:53.360]  common sense because it's difficult for our public now to have faith in our government.
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:57.680]  We need to make sure we go out of our way not to be involved in anything that would even look like
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:04.480]  a conflict of interest. Yet, they orchestrate these decisions and PBS did a wonderful job.
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:11.440]  Your listeners should Google Untouchables. It's a documentary that was done this year relative
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:16.640]  to the hands-off policy of our Department of Justice on the Wall Street banks. They had Lanny
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:23.600]  Brewer on the hot seat who was unable to logically answer a lot of their questions. Shortly after
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.120]  that, he resigned this year. Well, what about an impeachment of the head of the Justice Department
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:35.360]  for Fast and Furious? The word is in Forbes and other places as the house is moving to impeach
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:41.680]  the attorney general. And I think clearly for seeing that big banks are under different rules
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:47.520]  than the average person on the street. I mean, if I was caught laundering $100,000, I'd go to jail
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.200]  for probably a decade or something. They're laundering billions and don't get in trouble.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.640]  I mean, what do you say about the attorney general? I know it's scary to stand up to
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.360]  somebody like that, but you have a lot of courage, Mr. Mazer. I mean, should they have
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:05.520]  impeachment investigations just for the protecting the banks alone? Well, I think that there needs
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:10.720]  to be some hearings about why certain things happen. I was just telling you about Lanny Brewer.
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:14.960]  He resigned, but you know what he did? According to a New York Times article, he went back to
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.200]  Covington in Burling, and now he gets a salary according to the New York Times article of roughly
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:24.240]  $4 million a year. Now, if that had happened in Mexico, there would be people in this country
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.840]  that would be claiming that this was a clear sign of corruption. I'm not saying again that it's
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.240]  corruption, but it's certainly very, very poor judgment about it. Come on. Absolutely. It's a
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:38.400]  revolving door, and then he'll be back in another administration. It just goes on and on and on.
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.280]  Look, I understand that the drug culture is degenerate. The whole thing's bad. And I made
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.120]  the point about if you get rid of the drug war, then it's going to spread to kidnapping and stuff
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:51.840]  now. But that's kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't. Justice be done by the heavens fall.
[01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.840]  I don't mean decriminalized hard drugs, but they're pushing prescription stuff just as
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.760]  bad or worse on kids. What about a decriminalization? Wouldn't that make all these drug cartels and banks
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.840]  the fact that they're really drug dealers rise up like a cold sore?
[01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.800]  Well, I'd have a hard time supporting the idea of methamphetamine, crack cocaine,
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:18.320]  some of the hard drugs being legalized. We've got a conflict just on the cannabis issue that
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:22.000]  really needs to be resolved. The Drug Enforcement Administration and the federal government,
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:29.680]  the Department of Justice, says that marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug, meaning that it is hallucinogenic.
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:35.520]  It's highly addictive, and it has no medical purpose. Yet, there are 20 states plus the
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:42.400]  District of Columbia that have now adopted medical marijuana laws. There are three states
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:47.520]  that have adopted personal use of marijuana as being legal.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:52.480]  Well, I support this. I'm not sure which side is right, but I can tell you this.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:56.400]  We can't talk out of both sides of our mouth and put our head in the sand like ostriches.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.760]  The federal government can't say it's illegal in the state, say that it is legal. Let's get it
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:04.000]  resolved. If the majority of the people want it to be legal, then I guess that's something that
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.880]  we should seriously do. Here's my issue. You decriminalize it just like alcohol. It's easier
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:13.360]  to get crack cocaine on a Sunday here in Austin, Texas. I see the crack dealers all over East Austin,
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:18.880]  and it's for me to get a bottle of Jack Daniels. That's all I'm saying is that
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:23.280]  you decriminalize, it takes a lot of the money out of it. Listen, Robert Mazer, thank you so
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:27.680]  much for coming on. I hope we can get you back on in the future. I'm heading on reading your book,
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.600]  v-infiltrator.com, is where you can find it. Thank you very much. Thank you.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.520]  All right. Look, that guy comes from the inside establishment, and he is a pretty big whistleblower
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.600]  over the years exposing corruption, so he has courage. I'm not knocking him, but come on.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:46.240]  You've got to decriminalize this stuff. It's wrecked Mexico. It's wrecking our country,
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:51.040]  and I don't use any of the illegal drugs, any of them. I hardly even drink anymore because I want
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:49:01.360]  to lose weight, but it is just fantastical, fantastical that it's easier for me to go by
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:10.000]  a six pack of beer on a Tuesday afternoon, but on a Sunday, it's easier to go by hard drugs
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.880]  if I wanted to because the liquor stores are closed. I mean, there is so much money in this,
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.280]  it's only going to get worse, and then you've got big pharma pushing stuff that the molecules are
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.280]  even worse. If you just look at them side by side and what they do to the brain, then the illegal
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:32.000]  stuff, but it's really a mess. And then meanwhile, the government's trying to block us getting high
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.400]  quality supplements. You know, I looked up a case of the day where the FDA told somebody
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:41.120]  they couldn't, I think it was Nestle, they couldn't sell bottled water and say it hydrates you.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:46.880]  I mean, they can have drugs on TV that'll kill your dad in a hammer and deadly flu shots. That's
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:53.120]  okay, but you can't say water hydrates you. It's amazing. Speaking of that, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:58.320]  we have what I absolutely have been blown away by. I did deep research on the thyroid, on health,
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:03.040]  with medical doctors, scientists, nutritious, you name it, and found the one form of truly
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.680]  atomic nascent iodine. A lot of the other competitors taste like rocket fuel,
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.720]  and we're having it tested right now. It's not even nascent iodine, folks.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:18.000]  This is real nascent iodine, and it's pure, it's not bonded. So it's unlike anything I've ever tried
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  or been around, and it's just, it's what has come from my mind personally. You've seen the
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.320]  rave reviews out there. SurvivalShield, available from InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com,
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:38.160]  are called toll-free 888-253-3139-888-2533139. We have more of it in stock. We are the only
[01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:44.000]  people that have this worldwide, ladies and gentlemen. True nascent iodine and a glycerin
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.840]  base with a proprietary system to develop it, and just take the challenge, get it? And I think
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.200]  it'll be blown away if, regardless, you'll be fighting the operation, so it's a win-win

[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:35.840]  Thank you so much for joining us. We've got two guests coming up now. I'd like to get to calls,
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:40.480]  but there's just been so much breaking news. We've got two other guests joining us. Larry
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:46.000]  Claiman is going to pop in for about 10 minutes to talk about moves to get impeachment of Obama,
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.720]  at least the Attorney General going. He's coordinating that with World Net Daily and others.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:55.360]  Very exciting. You've got to repudiate this. And then James O'Keefe has dropped
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:00.400]  Megabomb Show just like when they blew up politically. So that's the InfoWars. It's
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:03.680]  better to blow things up politically. The globalists want to get a physical fight going
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:07.520]  because they don't have the moral high ground. They want to try to win it like a thug would win it.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:12.400]  We're going to win it with the truth and justice. He went into one of these acorn type groups,
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:17.600]  the navigator groups, and they just admitted amazing things. That video is now out today.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:22.480]  It's up on infowars.com, prisonbody.com. It's the top story still. Make sure it's the top
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:27.600]  story still at drudgereport.com up in the right hand corner. Yeah, there it is.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:35.760]  Video shock. O'Keefe reveals Obamacare corruption, the navigators. And they're in there saying,
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:41.920]  yeah, we lie to people. I mean, it's amazing. Last time he went into Acre, and this is that
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:49.280]  kind of groups. Yeah, I want to run child sex slaves. All right. Yeah. Let's go to the next
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:55.680]  office. Same deal. It's so gangster, man. And people nowadays think being thuggish and corrupt
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:56:02.320]  is like so sexy. It's like all I want to be around is people that are good and do what they say.
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:06.320]  You can turn your back on them. It's the best feeling in the world. But I'm just learning how
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:12.080]  many people are rat like I finally have got a pretty good crew around me a great folks. And
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:16.640]  we're getting better and I'm getting better too. But I tell you, it is creepy. It is absolutely
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:22.320]  creepy how rat like people are. And man, it's just you see it. It's like, wow, because they don't
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:27.280]  know how to have a real economy. I guess everybody just thinks if you get something, it's got to be
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:33.680]  hoodwinked out of somebody. Oh, very, very frustrating. Some of the other news up on infowars.com.
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:40.720]  Obviously, Clinton has come out and said honor thy commitment, just to act like the Democrats
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:45.680]  don't like what's happening, you know, protect the criminal franchise. And like Obama did it.
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.920]  See, first, Sebelius fell on her sword, but stayed in office. And she'll get some $10 million
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.800]  a year job, you know, ripping everybody off. And then Obama they'll rehabilitate later like,
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:58.560]  do what she said. See, they already caught already got caught lying already got caught
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.560]  saying they didn't lie. So now it's listen here, you know, I'm the paragon of honor, never lying.
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:10.240]  That's why they call me Pinocchio. Yeah, I didn't have sex with that lady. I didn't give
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:16.720]  missile secrets to the commune to Chinese either. But I tell you, I do like I do like
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:22.640]  specialty cigars of special type. And I am a little different than the Republicans. I like
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:29.280]  to rape women. I like to punch them in the face and bite them and break their noses and stuff.
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:35.520]  Sort of lawsuits about that. That's all all the feminists like me. They like getting punched
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:41.040]  in the face and their nose is getting broken. I like to use a lot of cocaine. You know,
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:46.640]  my brother said, my brother said about me that I got a nose like a vacuum cleaner. That's why
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:51.760]  I've had all these heart attacks and look like a zombie. I'm a total drug addict. But I'm still
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:58:01.200]  a sex addict as well. I'm so honorable. I'm the first black president, Obama. You're the second
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:07.760]  black president and it's racist. If you don't, if you don't rip everybody off, I mean, be nice to
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:17.120]  I'm so trendy right now. I love you. Turn your guns in and care about the kids.

[02:04:54.880 --> 02:05:03.440]  previous things i've said the veritas with the baloney tops a little over a year ago i began to do
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:08.560]  a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving and my
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:13.760]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:19.280]  united states and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:25.280]  the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:30.720]  and be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and

[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:08.640]  multiple locations and showing them agreeing to help him run underage prostitution ranks
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:17.200]  and how to abscond from the law with stuff that should be illegal and it should be very
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:23.040]  illegal keep your hands off kids and he's been sued attacked but defeated at all arrested
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:29.040]  by the feds by the states he's going to be joining us because this new video is the new akron type
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:33.040]  groups the navigator groups come out new york felony groups that have been caught taking
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:38.000]  money that this is another group he went into saying oh we you know we basically lie to people
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.280]  you know we lie to folks about obama here so that is coming up we're joined right now by larry claiming
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:51.600]  of course who helped to get the move towards impeaching clinton going and he heads up reclaim
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:58.560]  america now dot net and freedom watch usa and he also writes for world net daily and he just
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:02.480]  continues to break huge stories constantly i wanted to get him on about just for like ten
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:07.360]  fifteen minutes about any other big breaking stories he's working on uh is the intel correct
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:13.440]  out of forbes and washington times that it's imminent impeachment hearings uh of the attorney general
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.960]  for lying about fast and furious and protecting the money laundering at the big banks i want to
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:24.160]  ask him about that his move to get impeachment of obama going with a lot of top speakers we're
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:28.400]  going to get into that with him and then just talk about the whole state of the craziness
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:35.600]  that everything that he and i who were informed would talk about 15 you know 16 17 18 years ago
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:40.400]  is now just mainstream but there's the weird paradox of it's all out in the open now but
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:45.280]  the establishment doesn't get in trouble so it's it's that weird point of they either go ahead
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:49.920]  and start getting in trouble or the fact that it's exposed is almost worse because then it sets the
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:55.360]  precedent for all the other criminals in government to say hey nobody's stopping us let's go crazy
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:00.960]  so it's a real paradox we're in larry claiming thanks for coming on with us thank you alex it's
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:05.520]  my pleasure i said a lot there in that two-minute intro uh what do you want to tackle first well
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:10.240]  what i want to tackle is the state of where we are as a country uh and we can encapsulate it
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.920]  basically we're sinking faster than a rock uh we've come forward this is what i said at the
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:21.840]  veterans memorial three weeks ago you know we've declined quicker in 237 years and it took Rome
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:28.320]  over 2000 to do and it's happened just in the last three administrations in particular uh
[02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:34.240]  dealing particularly with clinton and with obama uh bush you know it might be didn't do a very good
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.960]  job but at least he wasn't trying to destroy the country but the bottom line here is that the
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:44.720]  american people need to rise up we can see what's happening with obama here now you know the
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:48.880]  republicans could have blocked it they didn't want to block it because they wanted an election issue
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:59.680]  in 2008 and 2012 now they're using it 2014 uh in 2016 we have no leadership we can't
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:04.160]  reduce the budget deficit uh we have people overseas who are dying because of rules of
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:09.600]  engagement favor muslim jihadists over our own people and republicans watch and they see
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:16.960]  this guy obama who is in my view a muslim uh you know furthering his own his own creed over there
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:23.440]  and you know it's out of control so we need to rise up and we want to do it peacefully and
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:28.880]  unviolently uh we have put together a coalition first time in modern history that all these
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:35.680]  conservatives and libertarian groups come together we realize we have to as benjamin franklin said
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:40.560]  all hang together we're separately we're all hang and we're going to be in front of the white
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:45.440]  house we got a permit believe it or not uh i think they were scared of us and gave it to us they
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.440]  didn't want the controversy not giving it to us and we're going to be in front of the white house
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:56.160]  on the 19th of this month november beginning at 10 a.m we want everybody to come it's not
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:02.400]  discretionary it's mandatory if you love this country come to washington look at our website
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:10.080]  reclaim america now dot net reclaim america now dot net we need your support in every respect
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:16.960]  uh and we need to rise up as jefferson said our great third american president founding father
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:22.640]  and the guy drafted the declaration of independence primarily when the government fears the people
[02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:29.200]  there is liberty when the people fear the government there's tyranny well said larry and and again
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.000]  you guys having this rally won't save the world this radio show today won't save the world but all
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.520]  of us resisting speaking out saying no doing the right thing taking care of our families being
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:46.000]  honorable that is what is going to save civilization and and and again i was a giant critic of george
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:51.120]  w. bush and was called a communist in the news because i didn't like what was going on i've got
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:57.760]  to say bush never tried to ship general motors to china uh and and and and even the worst neocons
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:05.120]  didn't do something with obama it is cloward and piven wreck the country socialize it and i guess the
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:10.160]  establishment really is trying to use a communist model to take over i'm not saying they're communist
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:17.280]  they're offshore crony capitalist kleptocrats on record but the obama gang really fundamentally
[02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:22.240]  hates america hates freedom and you can see what they're doing i mean my gosh the new army training
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:27.760]  manuals i've had you know top officers on about it uh saying george washington wouldn't be welcome
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:33.440]  in the military and don't be a christian uh or it's you know anti-terrorism law don't give money to
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:40.000]  the tea party uh but but they won't say major hassan was an extremist or was terrorism i mean
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:48.960]  they even i larry cannot believe how evil obama and his supporters are no truly i mean we've got
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:55.360]  a tyrant in the white house we're gonna be reading a kind of a declaration of independence
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:01.280]  at reclaim america on the november 19th because if you read the declaration of independence it's
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:07.120]  like exactly identical to the situation we have today and you know we put a few new things in there
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:11.440]  in terms of what we're demanding and we want his resignation and we want bainer's resignation
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:16.880]  and we want mcconnell's resignation we want them to go and we have to begin the process of showing
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:21.840]  the american people that we have our own fate in our own hands and we have to rise up and this is
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:27.680]  not just the beginning it's not the end and we will succeed in the end but we need to show force
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:33.920]  and of course it'll be televised i'm sure all over the place that i invite you alex to come to if
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:38.640]  you can't speak i would love to have oh wow uh if you will do that and get some of your other
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:43.600]  radio talk show hosts to come as well but you're fantastic we we need people like you because
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:49.600]  you say it as it is you don't mince words we don't have time to shade it right now and the republican
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:56.400]  party um is are the enablers of obama because they just roll over we've invited a number of people
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:03.120]  to this event tea party republican no one's coming you know why congress you know why because no one
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:07.520]  wants to stick their neck out they just want to go on fox news and and pontificate and beat their
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:11.360]  chest when it comes down to being down there with the people they're nowhere to be found well that's
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.120]  because they're intimidated by all the irs stuff and the and the persecution that's the reason we've
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:20.320]  all got to stand together or hang separate you give in to the tyrant they win you go past the fear
[02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:26.000]  they fall and again there are moves in congress and i want to get your take on that to start impeaching
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:31.520]  holder that could lead to obama when it comes out he gave the orders and and and on the persecution
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:37.520]  of tea party uh pro-life you name it but this is how big big things happen at small beginnings
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:42.720]  and the and the attitude is impeach obama i mean if we try to impeach clinton overlying
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:48.960]  which we should have for a lot of other reasons we've got to go after obama or it sets a precedent
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:54.000]  to do anything in the future you know that obama's committed on teen scandals he makes
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.920]  clinton look like a boy scout okay but uh this obama care thing lying to the american people
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:03.840]  about that out of there but you're never going to impeach him you see and that's why the american
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:09.520]  people need to rise up and and i don't mean this in a racist sense not at all you can't impeach a
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:15.600]  white guy i can impeach a black guy it's not going to happen so we have to rise up and we have to
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:22.080]  show force here i understand so you're saying we want him to resign and it's what you're going for
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:27.360]  we're going for resignation yeah and uh look it happened to nixon he had to leave town
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:33.920]  and you know nixon is a superhero compared to this guy my god he wasn't a traitor george
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:39.840]  w bush wasn't a traitor this guy's a traitor he's anti-american i mean we got to call it what it is
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:45.600]  he's ready to sell israel out the french had to step in to stop that with iran and i thank god for
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.400]  the socialist party party in france which has a foreign minister it happens to be jewish
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:55.360]  law and fab use otherwise we'd have a deal with iran that allows them to have nuclear weapons
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:01.600]  within a month and and obama wants to rubber stamp that he's anti christian he's anti-stimatic
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:07.280]  he doesn't care for anybody except the brothers of bread well there is no doubt funding al-qaeda
[02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:12.160]  in syria and the media covering up the mass slaughter of christians i mean that is unprecedented
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:17.360]  u.s weapons and training to kill christians why would they want to put al-qaeda in charge of syria
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:23.760]  you know who knows what's in their mind i i do believe this in my heart i didn't believe it at
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:29.520]  first you know when obama was elected i was hopeful i was proud that the country could elect an
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:33.360]  african-american president there are people speaking in our event or african-americans
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:37.840]  they're my my close colleagues in france i have great admiration for them which alan keys was
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:44.720]  president of the united states for instance but but obama you know he's someone who i believe
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:50.960]  he's in his heart and of course under syria law he is muslim his father was muslim he identifies
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:57.280]  with that uh whether he practices that formally or not and he's done everything he can the further
[02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:03.360]  muslim interest throughout the world at the harm is real and to well i think the issue is to i mean
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:10.480]  to help radical islamic groups and attack moderate regimes so it's it's it's it's it's it's just
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:15.840]  unbelievable and and you look at it it's like whatever the worst possession is whatever the most
[02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:22.640]  destabilizing position is obama's controllers like it and i and i it's it's a very very dangerous
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:27.520]  strategy they're involved in and larry i'll definitely have some camera people there who knows
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:32.960]  i might come to the rally because we do need obama we'd be honored to resign you know you'd be great

[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:10.640]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:22.400]  by the way i know it's next friday so it's about nine days away or some ten days away
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:33.200]  but i will be up in dallas next thursday friday and shatterday for the 50th anniversary of the
[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:38.480]  murder of john f kennedy and i wasn't even going to go for the 50th anniversary i grew up in dallas
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:47.440]  i've been to d le plaza hundreds of times driving by when i was a kid 20 30 times at events
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:52.880]  i mean we've already won the war on that people know the government killed kennedy
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:58.880]  the shadow government did and they try to prop the lie up i mean it's a joke it's like a guy
[02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:02.800]  standing at a dam that's collapsed he's got one brick in his hand like he's holding the dam up
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:07.120]  and it's all just shooting past him but i am going up there because it's the first amendment issue
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:15.840]  about a year ago i pledged to go up there when they put out the local paper that for thursday
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:20.800]  friday and saturday and friday's the 22nd the anniversary that no one is allowed into the
[02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:30.720]  huge d le plaza park complex overpass area that only the schoolbook uh museum that pushes the
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:37.040]  official story that a lone easter bunny killed john f kennedy with magic bullets that it was firing
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:45.840]  out of its uh out of its you know what easter bunnies do that ridiculous story uh they have the
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:50.080]  it's like a hop you know where the jelly beans come from that's where the bullets came from
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:55.760]  the point is is it's okay a leprechaun did it it's totally made up it's a fairy tale they said no
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:00.240]  one's allowed to be in there except people that agree with the official story and if you buy a ticket

[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:22.400]  experience the dallas police they all know kennedy was killed by the government they know
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:28.560]  because they were involved in it they're not stupid i know dallas police by the way i had family that
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:32.560]  was connected to dallas police and i'm growing up here and that they killed kennedy and i mean
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:36.480]  they all knew about it not that they killed kennedy but that the police knew about it so by knowing
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:40.720]  about it doing nothing they became accessories i mean it's just well known it's like a joke in dallas
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:48.080]  folks i've been on airplanes with like famous people but off record it wasn't even off record
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:53.520]  but it's so creepy they told me this stuff they're just like yeah grew up on the ranch were they
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:57.840]  trying to kill him and i'm sitting there talking to like famous people's lawyer and it's just like

[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:06.640]  talk to them yesterday they were making jokes about me thinking the government killed kennedy
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:10.800]  because if they laugh at me that means they're intellectual and i told the guy i said listen
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:20.240]  i had family that grew up in dallas and dated one of lbj's known hit men i mean i mean this is
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:28.720]  the kind of stuff i have grown up around this and it's just so incredibly frustrating to sit
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:33.520]  here i mean i've got friends that are related directly to the lbj family you name it i mean

[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:50.080]  money to siphon it and laundered it back into the communist party usa aka democratic party
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:55.600]  that is the takeover the gutter level communist and socialist
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:00.880]  ally with the foreign offshore banks into the us treasury using our military for global
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:08.080]  domination while bankrupting the nation and we are joined with major breaking news one of the top
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:15.520]  stories right now on national television like fox news thanks to drudge report dot com putting it
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:21.360]  out and it's crash their site uh the project veritas uh site is project veritas dot com
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:27.520]  and james o' keith its founder and head uh joins us but you can still go to info wars dot com where
[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:34.480]  you have the youtube video posted it's also on the national uh review and and i have to brag it
[02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:38.480]  was kit daniels months ago that first pointed out that these these so-called navigator groups
[02:34:38.480 --> 02:34:44.320]  that are being pre enrolled are many of them are known acorn splinter groups and it's come out in
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:50.720]  new york newspapers you know millions of dollars disappeared and uh in criminal indictments and
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:55.040]  things like that now this latest case happened in dallas that he went to investigate there's a lot
[02:34:55.040 --> 02:35:00.160]  of different groups or remember he went into acorn three and a half four years ago and that brought
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:06.880]  down that organization uh but again it just it just reconstituted itself and and there were
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:11.360]  many other groups like it that's what community organizing is is basically a just a groups that
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:16.480]  hold on the government funds and want to keep the locals impoverished because that's their business i
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:21.120]  mean that's that's how they operate and he went in and said i've got underage sex slaves i want to
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:26.960]  run in america please help me and they said over we're here to help you uh and so this is just an
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:34.800]  example of the type of stuff that the veritas project or project veritas dot com engages in and
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:41.520]  i won't go over his whole bio because most of you know who he is but you've got to clearly say
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:49.200]  that if if there is a bright center to libertarian constitutional common sense really nonpartisan
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:54.880]  real investigative muck raking journalism that's why we sell this book at m4store.com it's james oak
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:36:01.360]  keith uh and the project veritas uh and the work that they engage in but there's several different
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:06.320]  sites i have one here project veritas.com and then right here i project veritas.org but we'll
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:11.680]  ask him the best sites for people uh to visit and we'll also talk about his book some but wow
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:17.120]  just just just just looking at the work they've done is simply amazing so james oak keith thank you
[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:23.280]  so much uh for coming on with us today most people know who you are but but i mean recap this am i
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:30.320]  wrong in saying this is like acorn part two yeah that's exactly right alex this is a a lot of these
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:37.680]  groups um are local community groups which get federal money they received a total of 67 million
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:42.800]  dollars across the country nationwide and and in fact some of the money is going right to a group
[02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:49.280]  run by acorns highly controversial founder a guy by the name of wade rathke uh united labor unions
[02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:55.200]  and southern university networks in texas so we went to texas and we invent why do we go to texas
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:37:00.240]  because they have the largest number of uh people uninsured so they're doing a lot of enrolling into
[02:37:00.240 --> 02:37:07.520]  obama care and we got these recipients like in this case united way we're receiving uh hundreds of
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:12.880]  thousands of dollars in money just for these two offices we exposed telling us to deceive the iris
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:18.720]  lie to the federal government lie about our income and uh you know it's i guess it's just uh
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:22.720]  unbelievable what you know what these people are saying when no one's looking
[02:37:22.720 --> 02:37:30.400]  now break down uh the latest thing that just broke today uh what you were dealing with the
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:36.000]  group that it is particularly what obama navigators are i guess satan navigates us to hell they
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:43.600]  navigate us to clout and piven collapse uh tell us what navigators are navigators according to
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:49.120]  the department of health and human services will quote serve as in-person resource for americans
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:54.800]  who want additional assistance in shopping for and enrolling in obama care exchanges unquote so
[02:37:54.800 --> 02:38:00.640]  the president was in texas a couple days ago and he said that if you can't get into the website
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:07.040]  which nobody can then you're going to go in person and talk to these so-called navigators and they
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:14.320]  dish out uh millions of dollars to nonprofits and community organizations that have no experience
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:19.840]  in anything medically related but these people get all this money to basically sign people up on the
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:24.960]  on the obama care and we walked into these offices and and the video that we released this morning
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:32.160]  we walked into one such office in dallas texas and said that we had an all-cash business and
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:38.480]  that we were smokers and they basically told us to lie lie lie lie through our teeth lie to the irs
[02:38:38.480 --> 02:38:44.400]  lie to the federal government and and forge information on our forms to get more obama care
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:49.760]  subsidies because if you make less money you get more subsidies so they're telling us the
[02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:54.640]  long lie about our incomes so that we get more government benefits and this is the same story
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:39:01.680]  over and over again the illegals in austin texas and atlanta georgia one house can get 89 million
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:08.880]  dollars of fake tax refunds and no one gets in trouble because obviously there's organized
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:13.920]  criminal groups in the democratic structure especially that are literally running mafia
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:20.080]  takeovers billions of dollars in fake uh tax refunds and no one gets stopped and they even
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:25.200]  tell employers now enroll all your employees on food stamps on top of it so this really is a plan
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:30.800]  to bankrupt the country yeah i mean with in terms of the uh non-citizens what we think that they're
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:37.600]  going to do based on our research in texas is they're going to wait for those uh for for ammesty
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:43.440]  to pass and at that point in time uh everybody will be signing up for obama care but you know
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:48.080]  you can commit perjury you know you could say that you are a citizen when you're not and that's how
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:52.480]  people get registered to vote well you know we actually have them on tape in this video that
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:58.720]  we released today we have them on tape telling people lie in texas there's actually a statute
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:06.960]  um that prohibits people from um you know lying it's i believe it's section uh chapter 37 there's
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:11.440]  a statute that prohibits perjury and other falsification so these employees these federally
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:16.320]  funded employees that we released today could very well face a criminal indictment under chapter
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:23.120]  37 well i mean look look everybody knows there's federal and state statutes on lying in documents
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:29.280]  for financial aid uh i mean it's there's a whole bunch of laws it violates this federal law but
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:33.760]  even the state law i mean the perjury it it's as remarkably as this is people think about your
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:38.080]  right wing extremists no there's nothing right wing about this in fact i mean they're defrauding the
[02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:41.920]  federal government they're defrauding the health and human services because people that need the
[02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:46.480]  benefits can't get them but you know i i make 60 or 70 thousand dollars a year and they're telling me
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:51.840]  lying about your income say you make 15 thousand dollars a year it's basically Medicaid and Medicare
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:54.880]  fraud and by the way for those that don't know i want you to continue we're going to play a clip
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:58.720]  here in a moment of this new video you released today that's national headlines and we're very
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:04.240]  thankful you're here with us so james o'keith joins us project veritas.com but for folks that
[02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:09.440]  don't know we're already bankrupt at current expenditures if they bring in 30 more million
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:14.000]  illegals if they keep having everybody be three or four welfare checks we will go bankrupt so let
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:18.400]  me ask you this question before we play the clip what do you think the plan is because
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:23.920]  obama's double the debt obama i mean they really are trying to wreck the country do you agree with
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:30.880]  that uh based on our video in in texas it looks like not only are they you know is there the money
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:37.120]  being wasted but the video shows that the enroll america people the obama care people are working
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:43.760]  with political action committees to turn texas into a battleground state they're turning it into a
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:49.760]  democratic run state by using the data they get from enrolling people for healthcare that's that's
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:54.640]  illegal that's immoral that's wrong on so many levels you can't you can't implement a federal
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:41:58.880]  program and then use that to change the politics of the state but that's exactly what they say
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:02.800]  they're doing and it's in the video by the way the the whole video is up on info wars dot com
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:07.120]  and drudge report dot com right now your side unfortunately is down but but expanding on that
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:12.960]  my dad for some reason got on a democratic party mailing list he's also on the republican party
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:17.200]  mailing list he's more of a libertarian but he gives the republican you know uh libertarian
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.400]  candidates but somehow he got on a democratic list because the company he worked for had given some
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:27.040]  money to a candidate years ago and he was showing me this letter before he left town when he gets
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:31.360]  back from town in a week i'm gonna try to get him on the show if he'll do it and the letter said come
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:39.360]  to our emergency training meeting we're going to turn uh texas uh blue and we're going to use
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:45.280]  obama care to do it this is our time forward which is the social slogan so yeah the the
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:49.760]  head of the democratic party as you know yesterday said on cnn we're going to use that
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:55.680]  they're not getting it as the reason to keep supporting us so yes this they're making their
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:43:01.520]  move and they they will bring in enough foreigners and people in texas to literally contact my guns
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:07.600]  i mean this is a group of pirates so so what's your take on that well i think that you know
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:14.000]  it's it's illegal for a 501c3 group in rural america to give data to a political action
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.680]  committee so what my take is is that what we're going to do is we're going to expose it we're
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:21.440]  going to we're going to catch it catch it on tape we've already got this first video here
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:25.200]  and we're going to move on to the next series of videos that we're releasing this has been a
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:29.840]  three month investigation project very tossed up is very expensive it's very dangerous we spend
[02:43:29.840 --> 02:43:36.640]  months out there doing it but um we got we got alex we got about 200 hours of videotape uh battleground
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:43.040]  texas of enrolled america of navigators not only in texas but elsewhere as well telling us how to
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:48.640]  commit fraud and i think what we need to do is outrage the american people and and get the reactions
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:54.080]  from uh politicians light a fire under them to a certain extent and hopefully there'll be some
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:44:00.960]  change well for those that don't know uh this is is just so fundamental what's happening
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:05.680]  obama promised to create a national security force just as big and just as strong as our
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:13.040]  military that's what he's doing with the chicago urban organizer model they cut off the resources
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:17.760]  cut off the jobs put everybody on welfare and then to get the welfare you've got to become
[02:44:17.760 --> 02:44:25.040]  a political action person a literal political mercenary let's play a part of this exclusive
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:30.480]  breaking video here it is obama care navigators that receive millions of dollars of federal taxpayer
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:38.240]  money telling applicants to lie about their health status obama care navigators advising
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:46.320]  applicants that they always lie don't tell him about that but don't tell him uh i always allow
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:52.720]  my okay obama care navigators counseling applicants how to defraud the federal government
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:45:00.720]  making money on our cash basis okay don't get yourself in trouble by declaring it now
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:09.040]  exactly yeah it didn't happen okay we're different with that other just act as if that didn't happen
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:15.120]  okay never report okay days after president obama thanked navigators in dallas for signing people
[02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:20.400]  up on the new government run healthcare exchange if people can't get through the website people
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:27.200]  can apply in person if they've got committed folks who are out there helping people to sign up
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.080]  okay project veritas heads to texas to expose obama care navigator fraud
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:50.000]  i want to turn texas into a battleground state turn texas through there are there are few navigators
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:46:00.000]  here in town i haven't been able to get anybody locked up
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:13.680]  so we are in roll america we are a 501c3 non-profit non-partisan organization
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:20.640]  what in roll america does is it goes we're running a campaign called get covered america
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:28.000]  we are right now in 11 states um obviously with uh texas being the biggest because we have the most
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:33.360]  uh uninsured in the country there are there are few navigators here in town that have
[02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:39.280]  that got that received grants from the now all right folks it's powerful already but we don't
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:44.400]  have time to get the real meat of it it's up on drudge report dot com info wars dot com i tell you
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:50.560]  go to project veritas uh but their uh site is down from massive traffic right now it's important
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:54.800]  to get this video and get it out everywhere because they will try to take it down they will try to
[02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:59.120]  block it but it's important to get the full video out there and of course mr. okieff doesn't go over
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:04.640]  the hell he's gone through being sued arrested but always defeating it later for telling the
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:12.160]  truth he he literally uh is walking point for everybody but here's the issue notice and i said
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:16.960]  this i said the website i said the system will not work i said you watch because the bill doesn't
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:21.360]  give you free healthcare doesn't do all this and then of course that's the plan then send you to
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:26.480]  the community organizers who are democratic operatives and you have them on the video is
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:30.640]  saying that they then hand it over to the democrats and you're literally being enrolled into the
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:37.120]  democratic party for the federal money uh so this is just a mainlining of what they've always been
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:41.200]  doing and then make the country socialist everybody will vote to take our guns and make
[02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:47.600]  us slaves james okieff tell folks what else is on the video so alex on the rest of the video there's
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:56.320]  a uh a video a clip of uh these two offices national urban league which get $400,000 in taxpayer
[02:47:56.320 --> 02:48:02.960]  federal taxpayer money to sign people up for obama care in texas uh counseling our reporter who
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:07.680]  says he's a smoker he says just lie so that your premiums can be lower that's that's a crime you
[02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:13.280]  can't lie about your health status to the federal government and then there's also video footage
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:19.440]  of enroll america which is a 501c3 group uh sharing and cross pollinating data with a political
[02:48:19.440 --> 02:48:24.480]  action committee called battleground texas the purpose of battleground texas in simple terms is
[02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:29.760]  to turn texas blue because these people think that texas is not voting states so if they just
[02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:35.200]  sign a lot of people up to vote it'll turn into a democratic state they're using enroll america and
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:43.600]  obama care as a as a mechanism to turn texas into a blue that's right and texas is better better stop
[02:48:43.600 --> 02:48:49.200]  taking it for granted uh that that we're safe and we're going to keep our guns and stuff no
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:52.960]  they have announced this is their target they will break texas go ahead
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:59.920]  what we're going to be looking at in part two and and they'll navigate a fraud is bad it's it's
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:03.520]  the these are the troops these are the ground troops if you will people who sign people up so
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:07.840]  it's very important we expose all these navigators which we will do but even more important that is
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:13.360]  the leadership of enroll america and they have a project called get covered america which is a
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:20.400]  project of enroll america this organization is getting data uh your medical data your names
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:25.280]  your telephone numbers maybe even your social security numbers and they're using that to get
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:29.440]  out the vote they're using that for political purposes which is a violation of your of your
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:34.640]  privacy and it's against the law and that's what that's what we're going to be doing in the coming

[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:31.920]  you know as soon as that comes to pass then we'll start releasing the next tape and that's really

[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:08.800]  going on it's a revolution of people in government allied with select corporations to just lawlessly

[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:25.120]  around backwards project truth is with us and i want to play this final clip and get your take on it
[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:32.880]  this again is the democrats masquerading as obama enrolle's saying their goal is to turn the state
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:38.880]  into a democratic stronghold all the better to then milk it of course here you go and their purpose
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:43.360]  in simple terms is to turn texas blue so we have grassroots organization
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:50.480]  dedicated to turning texas blue yeah turning texas into a battleground state if we can change that
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:57.200]  we can uh we can change the course of elections we can rule pretty pretty pretty drastically now
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:02.320]  battleground texas has a long-term stretch they're not just going to play until 2014 they go home
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:09.520]  this thing is a long-term process i mean this is years coming yep it's a military operation and
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:14.480]  they are in charge and they say on msnbc your kids belong to them so this is this is how they build
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:20.720]  an empire they don't build widgets or farms or jobs they run your life and they will run it
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:25.760]  and they're the slave masters of old reborn as the loving trendies and the republican parties
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:30.160]  run by some of the same people so they want to pose it at the national level james o'keith
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:35.040]  any other points you want to make about what we're dealing with here and i bet you're bracing for
[02:56:35.040 --> 02:56:40.560]  the repercussions uh these folks never sit back when you expose what what they do secretly yeah
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:44.960]  i'm just trying to figure out if it's cathleen civilias who's uh who's involved in our website
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:53.680]  being forbidden uh 403 or if it's uh or if it's the nsa but we uh or if it's the traffic but um
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:57.440]  you know in terms of repercussions this is not my first rodeo alex i've been
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:03.600]  and subpoenaed half a dozen times i've been sued i've been incarcerated uh for a crime i didn't
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:08.320]  commit and um at this point in time what we're looking for is we're looking for a breakthrough
[02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:12.000]  into the mainstream media and the way we think we can do that is by just continuing to release
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:15.680]  these tapes one by one and i think we might actually get the attention of the white house
