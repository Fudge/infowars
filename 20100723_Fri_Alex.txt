[00:00.000 --> 00:16.400]  Waging War on Corruption It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:16.400 --> 00:22.440]  front lines of the Info War We're live, ladies and gentlemen, it is
[00:22.440 --> 00:28.600]  Friday, the 23rd day of July 2010, for the next 30 minutes we have an exclusive interview
[00:28.600 --> 00:32.880]  with Governor Jesse Ventura, of course with this hit TV show, now going into its second
[00:32.880 --> 00:37.920]  season, they're producing conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura, he has had trouble all
[00:37.920 --> 00:39.920]  over the country.
[00:39.920 --> 00:43.640]  Most of this we can't talk about because it's the TV show, but now the harassment,
[00:43.640 --> 00:48.640]  the homeland security surveillance has gotten so bad that the governor wants to talk about
[00:48.640 --> 00:52.840]  this pattern here today and we're very honored that he contacted us yesterday to give us
[00:52.840 --> 00:53.840]  this exclusive.
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.480]  I'm also playing my own part in the show as a consultant, but the headline at InfoWars.com
[00:59.480 --> 01:03.400]  by Kurt Nemo, exclusive, Jesse Ventura talks with Alex Jones about government harassment
[01:03.400 --> 01:07.000]  of his TV show and it is really intensifying.
[01:07.000 --> 01:08.000]  Governor, thank you for joining us.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.880]  Hi, Alex, great to be here and again, I come on the air with you, Alex, just to inform
[01:12.880 --> 01:17.520]  the public out there of exactly what's going on with our U.S. government, it seems.
[01:17.520 --> 01:20.080]  Well, we appreciate you coming here first, sir.
[01:20.080 --> 01:25.560]  Well, ABC or NBC or none of them are going to air what I'm going to talk about.
[01:25.560 --> 01:29.960]  You can bet on that and I know that this is the place where freedom speaks.
[01:29.960 --> 01:33.600]  Have you had a chance to see the ABC news story that tries to make a joke about the
[01:33.600 --> 01:34.600]  harassment?
[01:34.600 --> 01:37.440]  It says Jesse Ventura brings his conspiracy theories to the Capitol.
[01:37.440 --> 01:42.720]  No, I didn't look at it, but what they always say in the entertainment world, any publicity
[01:42.720 --> 01:43.720]  is good.
[01:43.720 --> 01:46.160]  Absolutely, as long as they get your name right.
[01:46.160 --> 01:51.640]  Governor, break down the latest or the history of this, wherever you'd like to start.
[01:51.640 --> 01:56.760]  Well, the latest is, of course, we're doing, it's the second season, so they told me that
[01:56.760 --> 02:01.680]  I could do an episode on the murder of John F. Kennedy, which to me is the corner post.
[02:01.680 --> 02:07.640]  That's the pillar of everything, the downfall in my opinion of our country in the last 50
[02:07.640 --> 02:11.800]  years was because if you can murder the president and get away with it, what can't you get away
[02:11.800 --> 02:12.800]  with?
[02:12.800 --> 02:20.600]  And what we did, we wanted to take a finishing shot, very humble, of simply me standing in
[02:20.600 --> 02:27.200]  front of the eternal flame at Arlington National Cemetery, no talking, no anything.
[02:27.200 --> 02:34.520]  And bear in mind, Kevin Costner did it in JFK, they filmed him there, while we went
[02:34.520 --> 02:42.120]  to this character, this Ken Hawes, who's the US Army Chief of Public Affairs, and he denied
[02:42.120 --> 02:44.520]  it, and wouldn't let me do it.
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.240]  We did it anyway, though, Alex.
[02:46.240 --> 02:47.240]  We got the shot.
[02:47.240 --> 02:51.760]  In fact, the security people there were very helpful and they even used people out of the
[02:51.760 --> 02:52.760]  way.
[02:52.760 --> 02:54.760]  So, obviously, it didn't filter to the guy on the ground.
[02:54.760 --> 02:58.880]  This was happening in the upper echelon, trying to do it the correct way.
[02:58.880 --> 03:04.360]  But I went to my Congresswoman, Michelle Bachman, immediately, and I said, what is this?
[03:04.360 --> 03:05.360]  And she got outraged.
[03:05.360 --> 03:07.360]  She said, you have First Amendment rights.
[03:07.360 --> 03:13.400]  She contacted, let me read what happened real quickly, here on July 22, 2010, we called
[03:13.400 --> 03:15.720]  back and asked to speak with Mr. Hawes.
[03:15.720 --> 03:19.360]  We were told that Mr. Hawes was in Chicago filming blah, blah, blah.
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.040]  Nevertheless, the gentleman we spoke with said that he had discussed the matter with
[03:24.040 --> 03:29.320]  Mr. Hawes and said they considered the topic of your particular episode inappropriate.
[03:29.320 --> 03:34.680]  After receiving Mr. Hawes' cell phone number, we called him in Chicago to find out why you
[03:34.680 --> 03:37.680]  were not allowed to film at Arlington National Cemetery.
[03:37.680 --> 03:43.480]  According to Mr. Hawes, Arlington National Cemetery has a policy of prohibiting stand-up
[03:43.480 --> 03:44.480]  filming.
[03:44.480 --> 03:49.960]  Additionally, Mr. Hawes stated that you were denied in part because of the nature of your
[03:49.960 --> 03:51.480]  television program.
[03:51.480 --> 03:56.920]  Specifically, he stated the topic of your particular episode, which alleges that the
[03:56.920 --> 04:01.480]  United States government was directly involved in the assassination of President John F.
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.680]  Kennedy is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[04:05.680 --> 04:09.840]  Now, first of all, we don't say that in the episode.
[04:09.840 --> 04:10.840]  The episode isn't even finished.
[04:10.840 --> 04:11.840]  How would this guy know it, Alex?
[04:11.840 --> 04:12.840]  How would he know it all?
[04:12.840 --> 04:13.840]  What position we were taking on this?
[04:13.840 --> 04:14.840]  We were merely investigating it.
[04:14.840 --> 04:25.840]  But where does he get off doing public policy and putting his opinion in on whether someone
[04:25.840 --> 04:27.360]  cannot be allowed to do something?
[04:27.360 --> 04:31.640]  Governor, this is incredible, you have the Army trying to set the precedent at a national
[04:31.640 --> 04:37.280]  park of who can film and can't and saying no one's allowed to when the news media is
[04:37.280 --> 04:38.280]  down there every week.
[04:38.280 --> 04:39.880]  I see it constantly.
[04:39.880 --> 04:41.840]  This is so dangerous.
[04:41.840 --> 04:42.840]  Stay there.
[04:42.840 --> 04:45.960]  We're going to come back from a quick break and pick your brain about some of the other
[04:45.960 --> 04:48.280]  things that have happened, but expand on this.
[04:48.280 --> 04:53.240]  But what a dangerous precedent where the government says you can't film at national parks unless
[04:53.240 --> 04:55.400]  we agree with your message.
[04:55.400 --> 04:58.680]  But when is the Army running this country internally?
[04:58.680 --> 04:59.680]  Hello, friends.

[08:00.800 --> 08:07.400]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:07.400 --> 08:10.600]  With Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:10.600 --> 08:17.600]  Again, it's Friday, July 23, 2010, Governor Jesse Ventura joins us live from California.
[08:17.600 --> 08:22.160]  The last few days he was in D.C., part of a pattern of the government trying to block
[08:22.160 --> 08:27.760]  his First Amendment rights and selectively doing this for people's political or views
[08:27.760 --> 08:29.800]  period just on the country.
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.680]  Governor, for those who just joined us, recap what's happened, get more into what Congresswoman
[08:33.680 --> 08:38.440]  Bachman is saying and the Army trying to block you from a national park.
[08:38.440 --> 08:43.960]  Well, what happened, we're doing a show on the murder of John F. Kennedy and apparently
[08:43.960 --> 08:48.800]  the Army doesn't like it and they're in charge of our LinkedIn National Cemetery and the
[08:48.800 --> 08:57.000]  gentleman's name is Ken Hawes, belt A-H-A-W-E-S. For those listeners out there that were as
[08:57.000 --> 09:10.320]  outraged as I am, I'll give you his phone number, 310-235-7621, again, 310-235-7621.
[09:10.320 --> 09:15.400]  And I went to my Congresswoman, Michelle Bachman, when they refused to let me film, they're
[09:15.400 --> 09:20.400]  going through proper channels and I'll read again after receiving Mr. Hawes' cell phone
[09:20.400 --> 09:21.400]  number.
[09:21.400 --> 09:24.840]  We called him in Chicago to find out why you were not allowed to film at our LinkedIn National
[09:24.840 --> 09:25.840]  Cemetery.
[09:25.840 --> 09:31.240]  According to Mr. Hawes, our LinkedIn National Cemetery has a policy of prohibiting stand-up
[09:31.240 --> 09:32.240]  filming.
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.640]  That's not true because Kevin Costner got filmed there for the movie JFK with Oliver
[09:36.640 --> 09:37.640]  Stone.
[09:37.640 --> 09:39.120]  You see it in the film.
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.760]  Additionally, Mr. Hawes stated that you were denied in part because of the nature of your
[09:44.760 --> 09:46.560]  television program.
[09:46.560 --> 09:51.920]  Specifically, he stated, the topic of your particular episode which alleges that the
[09:51.920 --> 09:57.360]  United States government was directly involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy
[09:57.360 --> 10:04.880]  is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[10:04.880 --> 10:09.800]  So now the Army bureaucrats are deciding what Americans can do inside the country.
[10:09.800 --> 10:16.240]  Apparently, or they have control over what you can film and I was a governor, a mayor,
[10:16.240 --> 10:23.720]  I'm a U.S. Navy Vietnam veteran, John Kennedy was a Navy man, I'll bet you the President
[10:23.720 --> 10:28.080]  Kennedy could speak out on this, he would be more than happy to let me film at his eternal
[10:28.080 --> 10:29.080]  flame.
[10:29.080 --> 10:33.760]  Well, the issue is I've seen the news many times film there and as you mentioned it's
[10:33.760 --> 10:39.560]  in many films and documentaries in the film JFK which is saying it was a government operation.
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.280]  So they're clearly discriminating against you and it just shows this atmosphere of government
[10:44.280 --> 10:48.720]  control where the government's involved in productions of movies where the Army will
[10:48.720 --> 10:53.080]  try to block people even, you know, interviewing people in the military if they don't.
[10:53.080 --> 10:56.080]  You know what the bottom line is, Alex?
[10:56.080 --> 10:59.360]  These people are supposed to work for us.
[10:59.360 --> 11:04.680]  We pay their salaries, it's called paying your taxes.
[11:04.680 --> 11:11.880]  That's what hurts me a great deal is the fact that I pay this guy's salary and yet he has
[11:11.880 --> 11:17.640]  the ability to deny me from getting photographed by whom I consider the greatest president
[11:17.640 --> 11:25.720]  in my lifetime at his eternal flame because he happens to not like the content of my program
[11:25.720 --> 11:30.520]  and where we're going because some of us believe the Warren Commission's a clock as you know
[11:30.520 --> 11:38.600]  what, you know, and we still seek the truth even today.
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.720]  By the way, on another subject, she wouldn't go on air with me, it's kind of the same subject
[11:43.720 --> 11:47.880]  but I did sit down with Marina Oswald for two and a half hours.
[11:47.880 --> 11:48.880]  Wow, tell us about that.
[11:48.880 --> 11:54.000]  Well, you know, she wouldn't go on the air but I think the most dynamic thing was this.
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.160]  She said this to me, Alex, she said, nobody cares anymore and I tried to convince her
[11:59.160 --> 12:02.160]  that yes we do because this is the cornerstone of corruption.
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.440]  If they can kill the president and get away with it then they can do anything and I said
[12:07.440 --> 12:12.680]  it's important that history and we learn the truth no matter how delayed it is if indeed
[12:12.680 --> 12:18.920]  that we've been lied to and she looked me right in the eye and she said would you sacrifice
[12:18.920 --> 12:24.320]  your children for the truth and I looked at her and said no and she said neither will
[12:24.320 --> 12:25.320]  I.
[12:25.320 --> 12:26.320]  That means she's being threatened.
[12:26.320 --> 12:32.080]  Well, it doesn't mean she's necessarily being threatened but it means that certainly she
[12:32.080 --> 12:36.880]  feels that there is still a threat out there that if maybe she spoke out and said what
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.760]  she really felt that her children could come in some type of danger at least that's, you
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.320]  know, the way it was intimated to me and that's what I took from it was that she's still
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.000]  very protective of her children and she's 69 years old now.
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.160]  She speaks pretty good English and she's been married to her husband, Mr. Porter, for since
[12:56.160 --> 12:59.680]  two years after the killing.
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.720]  Of course, the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, her husband clearly set up, it's now admitted
[13:03.720 --> 13:09.840]  that he was CIA at that air base in Japan and that they had him infiltrate Russia and
[13:09.840 --> 13:10.840]  then brought him back.
[13:10.840 --> 13:17.720]  Of course, the film JFK covers all of that with a historical accuracy governor off air.
[13:17.720 --> 13:22.360]  You said boy, the government sure is acting guilty, not just with this JFK thing, but
[13:22.360 --> 13:28.040]  everything, everything we look into Alex the government behaves like they're guilty in
[13:28.040 --> 13:29.040]  hiding something.
[13:29.040 --> 13:35.080]  And let me put it to you this way and I won't say where I was, but I've now been tailed
[13:35.080 --> 13:38.600]  and put on by Homeland Security.
[13:38.600 --> 13:44.960]  I've been tailed by the Coast Guard and we don't do anything illegal, Alex.
[13:44.960 --> 13:47.000]  Everything we do on the show is above board.
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.760]  We try to go through proper channels and we simply, if something requires us to go on
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.720]  the water, we do it in international waters or waters that are supposed to be free to
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.240]  the public, but yet we tried to hire a boat and when they found out what we wanted to
[14:03.240 --> 14:05.480]  do, none of the fishermen would take us out.
[14:05.480 --> 14:06.480]  You know why?
[14:06.480 --> 14:12.120]  Because anybody on the coast, now their licenses fall under Homeland Security and Homeland
[14:12.120 --> 14:16.200]  Security can pull their license if they don't like what they're doing.
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.840]  I like to refer to Homeland Security today as the Gestapo.
[14:20.840 --> 14:23.000]  Well, absolutely.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.760]  You've got almost every major federal agency under it and now into the Real ID Act, they
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.480]  want you to have to have a federally licensed through the state ID card to even be able
[14:31.480 --> 14:32.480]  to work.
[14:32.480 --> 14:38.400]  It's a total tracking system and you also went somewhere where you were threatened to
[14:38.400 --> 14:39.400]  be shot.
[14:39.400 --> 14:40.400]  Well, yeah.
[14:40.400 --> 14:47.640]  They have areas in the country where they have signs up that say lethal forces are authorized,
[14:47.640 --> 14:48.800]  which I find unbelievable.
[14:48.800 --> 14:55.040]  Whatever happened to a trial, whatever happened to going to court, you know, how can you be
[14:55.040 --> 14:58.160]  judge, jury, and executioner in one fell swoop?
[14:58.160 --> 15:03.640]  Now, not saying that they necessarily have or did, but there's areas in this country
[15:03.640 --> 15:08.840]  where they're supposed to get lethal forces authorized if you cross this line.
[15:08.840 --> 15:09.840]  And there's not even a fence.
[15:09.840 --> 15:13.720]  It's just you cross some magical line on a dune buggy, you're dead.
[15:13.720 --> 15:14.720]  Yep.
[15:14.720 --> 15:15.720]  Well, you could be.
[15:15.720 --> 15:20.320]  It's not saying that you are, but they're authorized to take you out with lethal force
[15:20.320 --> 15:21.320]  if they desire.
[15:21.320 --> 15:28.040]  Well, Governor, I mean, as you know, in 1947, the CIA got unlimited money, funding and secrecy.
[15:28.040 --> 15:33.160]  And if you've got 60 years of a group being able to operate with unlimited funds and power,
[15:33.160 --> 15:35.520]  I mean, they've been caught shipping and narcotics.
[15:35.520 --> 15:38.120]  They've been caught engaged in assassinations.
[15:38.120 --> 15:40.760]  And they just think this country is their own private whorehouse.
[15:40.760 --> 15:45.640]  Well, you know, and unfortunately, our elected officials are allowing them to get away with
[15:45.640 --> 15:46.640]  it.
[15:46.640 --> 15:52.440]  You know, we need to, you know, get back to our country and remember always, Alex, that
[15:52.440 --> 15:57.360]  we, the people in this country was formed, we were supposed to be the priority.
[15:57.360 --> 16:02.000]  It was supposed to be a country of citizens, first government, second, but it's not that
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  way today.
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.000]  Government is number one and we citizens by the wayside because everything is directed
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.680]  towards the government, to the survival of the government.
[16:11.680 --> 16:16.840]  Governor, I know you've been busy shooting, but earlier in the week, top secret USA came
[16:16.840 --> 16:24.440]  out, two year Washington Post investigation, 850 plus thousand private corporate chiefs.
[16:24.440 --> 16:29.280]  That's close to a million with the highest level security clearance there is.
[16:29.280 --> 16:32.580]  And the Washington Post described it as a complete takeover of society.
[16:32.580 --> 16:37.400]  So we have a private corporate system that's giving itself government power, just running
[16:37.400 --> 16:42.040]  completely rough shot, and they admit that their plan is to end the freedom on the internet
[16:42.040 --> 16:43.040]  as we know it.
[16:43.040 --> 16:44.040]  Oh, I wouldn't doubt it.
[16:44.040 --> 16:50.160]  I said that probably about 10 years ago, I said the internet right now is the only thing
[16:50.160 --> 16:55.800]  where you can, you know, have total freedom on there, but I said rest assured the government
[16:55.800 --> 17:00.560]  will put high priority on getting control of the internet because that's the one place
[17:00.560 --> 17:05.800]  you can go to supposedly and have freedom and they're not going to allow that.
[17:05.800 --> 17:12.480]  You know, more and more, I'm seeing our country becoming under the thumb of corporate America.
[17:12.480 --> 17:16.560]  Not even, well, it's like, you know, it came out in the article that I said, I know I'm
[17:16.560 --> 17:23.000]  very clear on why we're in Afghanistan, Alex, it has nothing to do with terrorism and bin
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  Laden, that's all the big red herring.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  We're there for the lithium.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.400]  Did you see that story a month ago where they found the $8 billion of lithium over there?
[17:33.400 --> 17:39.640]  I mean, think about it, that runs every cell phone, computer, and soon to be electric cars.
[17:39.640 --> 17:45.200]  Well, you're absolutely right, we're in Afghanistan is to get the lithium, now, why won't they
[17:45.200 --> 17:48.720]  just be honest and say that?
[17:48.720 --> 17:54.280]  Well they went on to admit that it could be potentially a trillion dollars and that they
[17:54.280 --> 17:56.200]  knew this in reports before they invaded.
[17:56.200 --> 18:00.080]  It's also about the trillions in oil in that region as well.
[18:00.080 --> 18:03.080]  Right, you know, and that's the reason we're there.
[18:03.080 --> 18:09.040]  All this stuff on terrorism, you know, put it this way, terrorists are like a motorcycle
[18:09.040 --> 18:10.040]  gang.
[18:10.040 --> 18:14.200]  You know, they're out there, yes they do exist and there is a possibility that you could
[18:14.200 --> 18:19.480]  run into them, Terry might do it, but they are not what this government is making us
[18:19.480 --> 18:20.480]  believe.
[18:20.480 --> 18:25.440]  They are not, they are not like the Nazi army, they are not like the Japanese army of World
[18:25.440 --> 18:26.440]  War II.
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.200]  They're not a country out there, they're just small groups of criminals that are involved
[18:31.200 --> 18:36.680]  in criminal activity and you have to deal with them, but to put our, is there an excuse
[18:36.680 --> 18:42.160]  to put our country under lock and key and take our rights away from us?
[18:42.160 --> 18:47.400]  Absolutely and every major technology firm out there is getting massive government contracts
[18:47.400 --> 18:52.680]  to spy on the American people, they've completely butchered the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[18:52.680 --> 18:56.600]  All these groups have the motive for the terror, they stand to gain from it.
[18:56.600 --> 19:02.080]  As you see, the Financial Times of London with one of Obama's advisors, Robert Shapiro
[19:02.080 --> 19:06.840]  saying of if, in fact guys, print that quote for me, that if Obama doesn't have an Oklahoma
[19:06.840 --> 19:14.520]  City or 9-11, soon his political days are numbered.
[19:14.520 --> 19:17.640]  How would an Oklahoma City or 9-11 help him?
[19:17.640 --> 19:27.840]  To be blamed on domestic groups, to be blamed on the American people.
[19:27.840 --> 19:35.920]  I fully expect within 10 years that we're going to have to have national ID cards and
[19:35.920 --> 19:38.240]  you're going to have to show them to go state to state.
[19:38.240 --> 19:41.400]  They're already saying that we've got a national ID card and they do want you to have to have
[19:41.400 --> 19:42.400]  it for anything.
[19:42.400 --> 19:48.120]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest host of the hit television program, Conspiracy Theory.
[19:48.120 --> 19:51.280]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com and prismplanet.com are our websites.
[19:51.280 --> 19:59.400]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[19:59.400 --> 20:04.720]  Global meltdowns, massive unemployment, endless wars, a new currency crisis, financially and
[20:04.720 --> 20:08.360]  morally bankrupt, a great and terrible storm is approaching.
[20:08.360 --> 20:12.600]  So what's the best way to get ready to get prepared for hard times ahead in producing
[20:12.600 --> 20:17.680]  off the grid news, a weekly newsletter for independent patriots who want practical advice
[20:17.680 --> 20:21.520]  on how to survive and prosper in an increasingly dangerous world.
[20:21.520 --> 20:26.080]  It's the best way to get a black belt in emergency preparedness, survival skills and off the
[20:26.080 --> 20:27.080]  grid living.
[20:27.080 --> 20:31.600]  Off the grid news is fiercely independent, all about self-reliance and packed with helpful
[20:31.600 --> 20:37.160]  information on survival gardening, food preparation, alternative energy, herbal medicines, privacy
[20:37.160 --> 20:42.480]  and security, as well as God, gold and guns, with absolutely no apologies.
[20:42.480 --> 20:47.200]  And the best part, this $100 a year service is now free of charge for our listeners.
[20:47.200 --> 20:53.480]  That's right, free for our listeners who sign up at offthegridnews.com, that's offthegridnews.com.

[21:01.200 --> 21:06.760]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[21:06.760 --> 21:13.560]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and
[21:13.560 --> 21:19.040]  a single rotating banner ad on prisonplanet.com.
[21:19.040 --> 21:25.080]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk
[21:25.080 --> 21:27.280]  seed seller to the public.
[21:27.280 --> 21:31.840]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.

[21:46.680 --> 21:47.680]  food.

[21:56.680 --> 22:03.640]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[22:03.640 --> 22:09.320]  I designed our top-selling holster, the Supertuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked,

[22:24.360 --> 22:30.040]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[22:30.040 --> 22:33.440]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers and investment advisors won't talk about
[22:33.440 --> 22:34.440]  gold IRAs?
[22:34.440 --> 22:38.840]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[22:38.840 --> 22:40.520]  of gold for your retirement.
[22:40.520 --> 22:44.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[23:59.160 --> 24:03.680]  All right, folks.
[24:03.680 --> 24:05.880]  Final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[24:05.880 --> 24:07.120]  Don't forget the films.
[24:07.120 --> 24:09.320]  Now make a censor online.
[24:09.320 --> 24:15.480]  The Obama deception and of course, follow the republic available at infowars.com.
[24:15.480 --> 24:19.400]  Once I mentioned it, top Clinton official, only a terror attack in save Obama, financial
[24:19.400 --> 24:20.480]  times of London.
[24:20.480 --> 24:24.840]  The bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in Obama's leadership, said Shapiro
[24:24.840 --> 24:28.400]  adding, he has to find some way between now and November of demonstrating that he is a
[24:28.400 --> 24:33.760]  leader who can command confidence in sort of a 9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing.
[24:33.760 --> 24:35.960]  I can't think of how he can do that.
[24:35.960 --> 24:37.960]  Governor Ventura, is that chilling?
[24:37.960 --> 24:38.960]  Well, unbelievable.
[24:38.960 --> 24:43.440]  I mean, they talk about that it is fantastic to take place, to have confidence in your
[24:43.440 --> 24:47.000]  president, what, that he can fight a war, that we have the strongest military in the
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  world.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.920]  We've already proven that.
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.200]  You know, I just find it outrageous that someone would say that and what they'll do
[24:55.200 --> 24:56.600]  for political gain.
[24:56.600 --> 24:58.240]  Well, it's very brazen.
[24:58.240 --> 25:01.440]  They think we're a bunch of idiots to be talking like that openly.
[25:01.440 --> 25:06.000]  Governor, in closing, let's talk about the issue of the First Amendment and give out
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  that number one more time.
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.160]  This is Ken Hawes and he's the US Army Chief of Public Affairs and he's the guy that wouldn't
[25:14.160 --> 25:15.160]  allow me.
[25:15.160 --> 25:20.520]  And in the letter to Michelle Bachman, it said, his office also stated that he would
[25:20.520 --> 25:26.080]  almost certainly not allow filming at John F. Kennedy's Eternal Flame without the permission
[25:26.080 --> 25:28.080]  of the Kennedy family.
[25:28.080 --> 25:35.000]  So, he's saying the Kennedy family has to give permission to film at the Eternal Flame.
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.120]  It wasn't the Eternal Flame to burn eternally for all of us to see it, take pictures of
[25:41.120 --> 25:43.120]  it and live with it.
[25:43.120 --> 25:48.760]  And then it goes on to say, uh, uh, honestly, Mr. Hawes stated that you were denied in part
[25:48.760 --> 25:54.040]  because of the nature of your television program, specifically stated the topic of your particular
[25:54.040 --> 25:59.320]  episode which alleges the United States government was directly involved in the assassination
[25:59.320 --> 26:06.200]  of the President, John F. Kennedy, is contrary to the mission of the United States Army.
[26:06.200 --> 26:10.360]  Now, first of all, Alex, they didn't know what's in my show.
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.040]  My show hasn't aired yet, so they're simply assuming what's in there.
[26:15.040 --> 26:18.760]  And then they're denying me because of the content of the show.
[26:18.760 --> 26:24.640]  John Kennedy was rooted in Dallas and if you don't go along with the official story, you
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.680]  are not allowed to film at his Eternal Flame, if I guess if you go along with the official
[26:29.680 --> 26:31.920]  story, maybe then they'll let you.
[26:31.920 --> 26:32.920]  We didn't ask that.
[26:32.920 --> 26:44.920]  But again, his name is Ken Hawes, his phone number is 310-235-7621, once again, 310-235-7621.
[26:44.920 --> 26:50.880]  And I'd love for all real Americans to give this guy a call and give him a piece of your
[26:50.880 --> 26:53.880]  mind on who in the hell he thinks he is.
[26:53.880 --> 26:58.080]  Well, Governor Jesse Ventura, if we don't hang together, we'll certainly hang separate
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.760]  as Benjamin Franklin said.
[27:02.760 --> 27:06.080]  Separately on this issue, though, you said that Michelle Bachman, the Congresswoman from
[27:06.080 --> 27:08.520]  your state, is very upset about this.
[27:08.520 --> 27:14.520]  We need to have an investigation or, I mean, pretty soon the military will tell us how
[27:14.520 --> 27:15.520]  to wipe our noses.
[27:15.520 --> 27:16.520]  Exactly.
[27:16.520 --> 27:21.600]  And what's the military doing inside our country telling us things like that?
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.360]  The U.S. military is supposed to protect us not from ourselves, they're supposed to
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.920]  protect us from foreign invasion or foreign powers, but it seems they're becoming too
[27:31.920 --> 27:37.120]  much involved internally in our country, which I think Alex is part of the plan.
[27:37.120 --> 27:38.720]  And your book covers a lot of this.
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.120]  It's so jam-packed, American Conspiracies, and incidentally, it's available at infowars.com.
[27:43.120 --> 27:47.080]  You can get a free film of your choice when you get the book, American Conspiracies at
[27:47.080 --> 27:48.080]  infowars.com.
[27:48.080 --> 27:52.600]  And it just covers basically all the key issues, I think it's Jesse Ventura's best
[27:52.600 --> 27:56.720]  book, and it's a New York Times top 10 bestseller.
[27:56.720 --> 27:58.920]  We've only got about two minutes left, Gov.
[27:58.920 --> 28:04.720]  So much is happening, but it sounds like this second season is even more adventure and action
[28:04.720 --> 28:06.000]  packed than the last one.
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.080]  I think it's going to be, it certainly is being more adventurous and doing it.
[28:10.080 --> 28:14.480]  I guess we were under the radar the first year we did it, but now it's aired on TV.
[28:14.480 --> 28:18.360]  So we've obviously gotten the attention of the United States government.
[28:18.360 --> 28:21.320]  There's no doubt about that.
[28:21.320 --> 28:23.480]  And what, eight to 10 episodes this season?
[28:23.480 --> 28:25.480]  Yeah, eight for sure and possibly 10.
[28:25.480 --> 28:27.480]  We're doing eight for sure.
[28:27.480 --> 28:30.480]  We've completed, we've almost completed half of them now.
[28:30.480 --> 28:34.480]  So half of them are just about ready to go into the editing room and be put together
[28:34.480 --> 28:35.480]  into a final form.
[28:35.480 --> 28:41.320]  And then we got the other four to do before October and it should be on the air, I'm guessing
[28:41.320 --> 28:44.280]  around mid-October sometime.
[28:44.280 --> 28:45.280]  Well Gov.
[28:45.280 --> 28:48.960]  That is Alex, unless Mr. Haas has something to say about it.
[28:48.960 --> 28:53.680]  I'm sure if they ask for his input, my show will be censored and not allowed on television.
[28:53.680 --> 28:59.560]  Well, what is the army involved in what views of American citizens, much less a former governor
[28:59.560 --> 29:00.560]  is?
[29:00.560 --> 29:01.560]  I don't know.
[29:01.560 --> 29:06.240]  You tell me, to me they're overreaching their bounds dramatically and this Ken Haas guy
[29:06.240 --> 29:09.960]  should be relieved of whatever his duty is.
[29:09.960 --> 29:13.000]  Well we talked last time, a month or so ago, about an awakening.
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.480]  And I am seeing an awakening, so I hope the pendulum starts really swinging against all
[29:17.480 --> 29:18.480]  this tyranny.
[29:18.480 --> 29:19.480]  Me too, Alex.
[29:19.480 --> 29:23.600]  I got to run, you take care and I'll keep in touch and I'll let you know anything else
[29:23.600 --> 29:24.600]  that goes on.
[29:24.600 --> 29:25.600]  All right, Gov.
[29:25.600 --> 29:27.760]  Jesse Ventura, thanks for keeping us abreast of the situation.
[29:27.760 --> 29:29.680]  Thanks for the fit in the second or the first amendment.
[29:29.680 --> 29:30.680]  Take care.
[29:30.680 --> 29:31.680]  Okay, goodbye, Alex.
[29:31.680 --> 29:32.680]  All right, there goes Gov.
[29:32.680 --> 29:37.240]  Jesse Ventura about to go do a big interview on his JFK investigation.
[29:37.240 --> 29:41.200]  We appreciate him contacting us and giving us this exclusive breakdown of what's going
[29:41.200 --> 29:42.200]  on with the production.
[29:42.200 --> 29:45.800]  There's a lot more happening behind the scenes, but I'm not at liberty to talk about it.
[29:45.800 --> 29:48.200]  But it'll be coming out on the TV show in the fall.
[29:48.200 --> 29:49.200]  Stay with us.
[29:49.200 --> 29:50.840]  We're on the march.
[29:50.840 --> 29:53.360]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.360 --> 29:56.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:56.280 --> 30:03.320]  You may be arrested and your subject to other police action.
[30:03.320 --> 30:04.320]  Tyranny is here.
[30:04.320 --> 30:08.200]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[30:08.200 --> 30:10.600]  It really says that the state is God.
[30:10.600 --> 30:15.160]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[30:15.160 --> 30:16.400]  on earth.
[30:16.400 --> 30:21.200]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[30:21.200 --> 30:23.040]  expanded nationwide.
[30:23.040 --> 30:27.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[30:27.720 --> 30:29.120]  shadow state.
[30:29.120 --> 30:33.560]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[30:33.560 --> 30:37.600]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[30:37.600 --> 30:42.720]  Police cameras, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[30:42.720 --> 30:43.720]  corner.
[30:43.720 --> 30:46.920]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[30:46.920 --> 30:48.960]  The police state isn't coming.
[30:48.960 --> 30:49.960]  It's here.

[30:56.960 --> 31:03.040]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[31:03.040 --> 31:07.640]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family-owned
[31:07.640 --> 31:09.320]  and operated American company.
[31:09.320 --> 31:14.120]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[31:14.120 --> 31:16.800]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[31:16.800 --> 31:20.760]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[31:20.760 --> 31:21.760]  anywhere.
[31:21.760 --> 31:30.360]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[31:30.360 --> 31:34.360]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[31:34.360 --> 31:40.360]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[31:40.360 --> 31:45.360]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[31:45.360 --> 31:56.360]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 to visit our website, 5starsoap.com, for buying a one to two month
[31:56.360 --> 31:57.360]  soap sampler.

[31:58.360 --> 32:04.360]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[32:04.360 --> 32:09.200]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[32:09.200 --> 32:13.200]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[32:13.200 --> 32:17.360]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[32:17.360 --> 32:23.080]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[32:23.080 --> 32:29.340]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[32:29.340 --> 32:33.680]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[32:33.680 --> 32:39.000]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.240]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[32:44.240 --> 32:50.520]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[32:50.520 --> 32:54.520]  Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[33:20.520 --> 33:26.520]  We are back live, thank you for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[33:26.520 --> 33:29.520]  I said Governor Jesse Fitzgerald on this.
[33:29.520 --> 33:35.520]  I'm going to get into a bunch of news right now, but before I go any further, this radio
[33:35.520 --> 33:42.960]  show, our news websites, everything we do, and infowars.net, prisonplanet.tv, jonesreport.com,
[33:42.960 --> 33:48.280]  all of it is having a bigger and bigger effect and we are targets of the establishment.
[33:48.280 --> 33:54.920]  We are being demonized, we are being attacked in many ways, that I'm looking at revealing
[33:54.920 --> 33:59.400]  in the next week or so here on air, I'm not sure, I've been having to talk to council
[33:59.400 --> 34:04.360]  about it, I was doing that this morning, but we've always wanted to have a big effect,
[34:04.360 --> 34:12.440]  we've wanted to try to save this republic, save this nation, but things are getting
[34:12.440 --> 34:16.760]  so real, I mean you know that there is a quickening happening and I want to thank everyone
[34:16.760 --> 34:23.080]  who has made our work here possible, who have made prisonplanet.tv and the websites and
[34:23.080 --> 34:27.160]  the radio show and the films possible, and I want to encourage everybody now more than
[34:27.160 --> 34:31.760]  ever to get all the different books and videos and materials we carry at infowars.com, because
[34:31.760 --> 34:35.040]  your purchase supports us financially and allows us to do what we do, but that's really
[34:35.040 --> 34:38.800]  secondary, the main mission is waking people up and the American people need to see fall
[34:38.800 --> 34:45.880]  the republic and invisible empire, and of course the Obama deception, the system does
[34:45.880 --> 34:50.720]  not want you to see this information, they do not want you to go to prisonplanet.tv and
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.360]  to download my films and to burn them to disk and to give them to everyone you know, because
[34:54.360 --> 35:02.280]  the truth is contained in these documentaries, and it's having a really big effect, it's
[35:02.280 --> 35:09.720]  having a giant effect right now, and we need to continue what we're doing and expand it,
[35:09.720 --> 35:16.520]  because rack and ruin is where we're going if we don't reverse what's happening in this
[35:16.520 --> 35:21.680]  world, and we know if we lay down and do nothing, the bad guys are going to win.
[35:21.680 --> 35:30.720]  I shot a video a few days ago that we posted titled the road and allegory for life, and
[35:30.720 --> 35:36.600]  it's gotten tens of thousands of views, but I wanted to get hundreds of thousands and
[35:36.600 --> 35:41.080]  millions subsequently, because I think it's some of the most eloquent information I've
[35:41.080 --> 35:46.120]  ever laid out, so I would encourage everybody to go to our YouTube channel and to get that
[35:46.120 --> 35:47.120]  video for everybody.
[35:47.120 --> 35:52.680]  In fact, guys, will you pull that video up, the road and allegory for life, it's up on
[35:52.680 --> 36:01.480]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube, what was that?
[36:01.480 --> 36:05.000]  In fact, I had meant to air that today and then I'd forgotten that I wanted to air that,
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.240]  so we're going to play that coming up here in just a few minutes, because it ties into
[36:11.240 --> 36:16.280]  the film, the road, but also ties into everything else we face as a society.
[36:16.280 --> 36:27.480]  We openly have the NSA running around, spying on everything we do, and giving corporate
[36:27.480 --> 36:33.000]  governance, governmental power over our society.
[36:33.000 --> 36:41.680]  This is absolutely untenable, and it's something that we must resist and face up to.
[36:41.680 --> 36:46.000]  We know real tyranny when we're facing it.
[36:46.000 --> 36:58.360]  We know what modified tyranny and corruption is, and it is a very strange feeling to be
[36:58.360 --> 37:02.720]  here on air and to know that of all the people out there fighting the New World Order, we're
[37:02.720 --> 37:06.760]  in the top two or three organizations.
[37:06.760 --> 37:11.320]  It's amazing to know that all of this is going on and all of this is happening.
[37:11.320 --> 37:14.560]  Were you guys able to find it?
[37:14.560 --> 37:18.520]  Are we ready for it?
[37:18.520 --> 37:23.800]  All right, I'm going to go ahead and play this clip, this video clip, the road and allegory
[37:23.800 --> 37:24.800]  for life.
[37:24.800 --> 37:42.640]  I'm going to come back and hit some very important top stories, but here it is.
[37:42.640 --> 37:50.960]  I recently had a chance to watch the film, The Road, based on a novel by Carmack McCarthy.
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.080]  To say that this film is a master work is an understatement.
[37:56.080 --> 38:02.640]  This is probably the most powerful film I have ever seen, and it has so many different
[38:02.640 --> 38:05.680]  messages that operate on so many different levels.
[38:05.680 --> 38:12.120]  It has archetypal snapshots from things that have happened throughout human history, and
[38:12.120 --> 38:19.200]  it really is a story about the good guys versus the bad guys, and how tyranny and barbarism
[38:19.200 --> 38:27.120]  is the great enemy of civilization and humanity, and how love is such a wonderful virtue.
[38:27.120 --> 38:34.120]  It isn't until times of great adversity that we see the worst and the best in humankind
[38:34.120 --> 38:35.120]  being expressed.
[38:35.120 --> 38:41.760]  It made me think of a Victor Hugo quote from the French philosopher, adversity makes men
[38:41.760 --> 38:44.800]  and prosperity makes monsters.
[38:44.800 --> 38:50.960]  Another quote by John Quincy Adams, courage and perseverance have a magical talisman before
[38:50.960 --> 38:56.720]  which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air.
[38:56.720 --> 39:03.440]  Being a student of history, this dystopic near future film was very unsettling.
[39:03.440 --> 39:06.560]  I don't have nightmares about Big Brother coming to get me.
[39:06.560 --> 39:10.000]  I don't have nightmares about my children dying in car wrecks.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.400]  I don't really have nightmares.
[39:12.400 --> 39:18.000]  I've been having very disquieted dreams, I won't even call them nightmares, since watching
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.640]  this film because I have studied Leningrad and the close to a million people that died
[39:23.640 --> 39:30.080]  in that siege and the years of cannibalism that sustained the population under the Nazi
[39:30.080 --> 39:31.360]  onslaught.
[39:31.360 --> 39:38.080]  I have studied what happened of course in Rome and during the different phases of its collapse.
[39:38.080 --> 39:42.640]  I've looked at Hiroshima and Nakasaki and the hundreds of thousands killed by the A-bombs
[39:42.640 --> 39:48.200]  at the end of World War II.
[39:48.200 --> 39:53.240]  And this film has a pro-second amendment message, I mean if you don't have a gun during this
[39:53.240 --> 39:54.760]  collapse you're in deep trouble.
[39:54.760 --> 40:00.000]  I've seen that Hollywood meme of victim disarmament being pushed over and over again where you
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.880]  always see these horror movies and things where nobody's got guns to fight back against
[40:03.880 --> 40:04.880]  the killer.
[40:04.880 --> 40:10.160]  It was just asinine, it never really telegraphs that message of how important the gun is and
[40:10.160 --> 40:13.960]  how it can be used in the hands of bad people for oppression or in the hands of the good
[40:13.960 --> 40:17.120]  guys to protect themselves and their family.
[40:17.120 --> 40:23.920]  But the overall message in this film is intense love and commitment and the love that a parent
[40:23.920 --> 40:29.000]  can only have for their children and really a growing experience that you have that's
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.960]  built into us in our very genetic code that once you have children you really grow up
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.200]  or at least you should grow up to another level of understanding that it's your children's
[40:39.200 --> 40:42.160]  future that matters and their protection that matters.
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.560]  And when you understand that loving others through your children is important it teaches
[40:46.560 --> 40:53.520]  you the larger truth of life that we all are interconnected as a society, as a species and
[40:53.520 --> 40:58.160]  that if you love your children today don't you love your unborn great great great grandchildren
[40:58.160 --> 41:01.160]  just as much if you could hold them in your arms.
[41:01.160 --> 41:07.440]  Why then would you go along with illegal wars of aggression like Iraq and Afghanistan?
[41:07.440 --> 41:13.480]  Why would we accept the new good guys on shows like 24 torturing people's children from
[41:13.480 --> 41:15.400]  their parents to get answers?
[41:15.400 --> 41:21.400]  Why are we basically being dehumanized by design and the modern system that we're all
[41:21.400 --> 41:26.760]  living under right now is a form of creeping death where the social engineers literally
[41:26.760 --> 41:34.240]  traffic in our psyches and our souls and people have lost their empathy and their humanity
[41:34.240 --> 41:40.160]  and they've been made so envious and jealous and so self-centered that they lose the greater
[41:40.160 --> 41:49.200]  sense of community and we are literally submersed in toxins and additives and GMO all of which
[41:49.200 --> 41:54.760]  on record have been designed to reduce our fertility and to cause increases in cancers
[41:54.760 --> 42:01.880]  and the entire world population is fascinated now with catastrophe and collapse films because
[42:01.880 --> 42:06.240]  at a subconscious level the subconscious mind is much more powerful than the conscious mind
[42:06.240 --> 42:12.680]  and the human computer knows that humanity is in a crisis on so many levels but we can't
[42:12.680 --> 42:17.600]  recognize it because it's not a truck coming over a hill you know with 15 cannibals in
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.800]  the back that are planning to butcher you and your son it is a scientific corporate
[42:22.800 --> 42:28.080]  board that analyzes future trends and that tracks everything we're doing to where they
[42:28.080 --> 42:33.720]  can not just predict the future in mass movement or individual movement now with Google NSA
[42:33.720 --> 42:40.080]  type software but they can also guide the future and create false trends through the
[42:40.080 --> 42:47.360]  Madison Avenue PR machine and so we're losing our human destiny we're losing our connection
[42:47.360 --> 42:54.520]  to the land we're we're losing everything that makes us human I mean it is a horrific
[42:54.520 --> 42:58.600]  thing to have all these government textbooks and documents that we cover on the show where
[42:58.600 --> 43:02.560]  they admit they're poisoning the water they're poisoning the food sperm counts are down
[43:02.560 --> 43:08.360]  over 80% in the western world to know that HIV was a genetically engineered bio weapon
[43:08.360 --> 43:14.000]  to know that they are purposely adding mercury to the corn syrup to know that they're feeding
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.240]  GMO crops to animals that is causing them to become sterile and it's passing on these
[43:19.240 --> 43:25.360]  chemical toxins to humans to know that the BT corn that grows its own natural pesticide
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.640]  is wiping out the bees and then in all the studies it's causing massive organ failure
[43:29.640 --> 43:35.920]  in lab rats folks that is even much more horrific than this nightmare dystopic film that has
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.800]  perfectly presented one spectrum of human collapse and it also has some global warming
[43:41.800 --> 43:48.920]  propaganda in it about the atmosphere collapsing but what's strange is NASA just put out a
[43:48.920 --> 43:55.160]  report this week saying that they've seen the greatest atmospheric collapse in the last
[43:55.160 --> 44:01.280]  hundred years of recorded history in 2008 and 2009 but NASA was actually honest and
[44:01.280 --> 44:09.160]  said it's because the sun became semi-dormant and was not putting off any Coriolis solar
[44:09.160 --> 44:16.160]  flares and so that the earth itself has actually cooled in the last decade it was heating up
[44:16.160 --> 44:23.120]  and that cooling trend and that ionizing radiation that forms cloud nuclei has not been there
[44:23.120 --> 44:27.960]  in the last decade and so the atmosphere began collapsing thank God the sun just flared back
[44:27.960 --> 44:33.360]  up we now know that giant asteroids hit the earth conservatively every few hundred thousand
[44:33.360 --> 44:38.120]  years and it's the same with mega volcanoes like the one in Yellowstone we know it's not
[44:38.120 --> 44:42.840]  happening every 10 or 15 million years like scientists previously thought we know that
[44:42.840 --> 44:51.480]  the sun is not stable that it cools off and heats up we know that we are living on a tiny
[44:51.480 --> 44:58.320]  little blue green jewel floating through space way out in the boondocks and then when you
[44:58.320 --> 45:03.840]  read the globalist plans where they openly want to destroy the family and basically
[45:03.840 --> 45:09.920]  mechanize humanity and turn us into basically biological androids you realize that the threat
[45:09.920 --> 45:14.880]  in the short term isn't asteroids it's not global warming but that it is the elite with
[45:14.880 --> 45:19.400]  their open air genetic engineering I mean I just saw last week a major university study
[45:19.400 --> 45:24.360]  with this new salmon they've approved that within controlled conditions they did test
[45:24.360 --> 45:29.920]  and that the genetically engineered chimera it's a cross species only part fish extincted
[45:29.920 --> 45:35.000]  the other salmon within 40 generations and that's 40 generations in the open sea we know
[45:35.000 --> 45:42.520]  that they've for over a decade have part spider part goat chimera creatures genetic mutations
[45:42.520 --> 45:47.200]  that create body armor in their milk we know that the major GMO companies aren't just coming
[45:47.200 --> 45:52.760]  out with eight major food crops but hundreds and hundreds and that they are literally rewriting
[45:52.760 --> 45:57.680]  the genetic code of the planet and they don't even care of it has dangerous implications
[45:57.680 --> 46:05.000]  the real threat is this scientific elite that has literally walled off humanity in a kind
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.800]  of arrested development and they write about this and the establishment in articles written
[46:10.800 --> 46:16.280]  by Bill Joy and others have openly discussed the fact of do the elites even need humanity
[46:16.280 --> 46:20.800]  or are we garbage that has to be taken out and you read the official United Nations plans
[46:20.800 --> 46:25.120]  to reduce the world population by at least 80% and you realize that this entire world
[46:25.120 --> 46:31.200]  government in their own words is being built as a kill grid what's crazy is it's so horrific
[46:31.200 --> 46:37.400]  even though it's publicly available information the average person can't face it once you've
[46:37.400 --> 46:42.480]  seen the road you'll understand what I'm about to say but it totally resonated we all know
[46:42.480 --> 46:47.240]  veritas we know truth because it's something that was already in us and we see it as self
[46:47.240 --> 46:52.800]  evident when another fellow human being has experienced and thought the same thoughts
[46:52.800 --> 46:57.240]  you're having but just from a different perspective and that these men and women could come together
[46:57.240 --> 47:03.240]  and make this film that this author could write this book and could put out such veritas
[47:03.240 --> 47:09.040]  it is just a work of extreme beauty and touched my soul at the deepest places even though it's
[47:09.040 --> 47:17.320]  ugly through that ugliness it lets you understand how important goodness is and love and honor
[47:17.320 --> 47:23.120]  and family and self defense are you with the good guys or are you with the bad guys and
[47:23.120 --> 47:28.360]  do you carry that fire inside you that even as we're becoming nihilistic and more and
[47:28.360 --> 47:32.120]  more evil and even as people look around them and say everybody else is evil I'm going
[47:32.120 --> 47:36.960]  to be evil it's saying no I'm going to carry the fire in myself I'm going to be good I'm
[47:36.960 --> 47:41.520]  going to try to be pure I'm going to try to be loving I'm going to try to be honorable
[47:41.520 --> 47:46.720]  it doesn't mean any of us are perfect but you're striving you're carrying that fire inside
[47:46.720 --> 47:51.800]  of you and so I salute the filmmakers and I salute everybody else who sees this film
[47:51.800 --> 47:57.960]  and is touched by it because this is truly the greatest masterwork in filmmaking that
[47:57.960 --> 48:04.520]  I have ever seen okay that's my review of the road if you want to send that out to folks
[48:04.520 --> 48:09.480]  because it has a lot of key issues laced in it it's the road an allegory for life just
[48:09.480 --> 48:14.560]  search that term and you'll find it an allegory for life the road okay here's some news I'm
[48:14.560 --> 48:18.520]  going to come back and get into two pulled from playing over 9 11 video this gets into
[48:18.520 --> 48:26.680]  the hysteria and mind control and the attack on any free speech of any type us forces step
[48:26.680 --> 48:33.080]  up Pakistan presence the Washington Wall Street Journal reports the Wall Street Journal
[48:33.080 --> 48:38.320]  not the Washington Post and it just shows how these wars are all being expanded everywhere
[48:38.320 --> 48:43.480]  just like Vietnam started with advisors that's how this is starting the Jerusalem Post reports
[48:43.480 --> 48:50.560]  Navy braces for Lebanese flotilla set to try to break the blockade in the next week the
[48:50.560 --> 48:57.400]  flotilla of 13 ships and of course they've had a big war with Lebanon three and a half
[48:57.400 --> 49:04.760]  years ago so more escalations there UK admits using DUM as ammunition in Iraq to put a uranium
[49:04.760 --> 49:13.880]  deadly for those that get shot with it and those that also use it also Iran's government's
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.520]  calling for harsh responses anybody that tries to board their ships in the Persian Gulf so
[49:18.520 --> 49:22.200]  that's escalating the provocations on that front of course last few days you've heard
[49:22.200 --> 49:28.720]  all the media talking about Congress of any institution in the United States has the
[49:28.720 --> 49:33.520]  lowest approval rating of any institution and that it's continuing into freefall that's
[49:33.520 --> 49:38.120]  because Congress goes against the Constitution Bill of Rights and the will of the people
[49:38.120 --> 49:42.920]  it's an illegitimate criminal group on average the majority of these people are a bunch of
[49:42.920 --> 49:48.520]  global stooges in there just helping carry out the bank robbery of the American people
[49:48.520 --> 49:53.680]  so there is a major awakening taking place on that front there is some good news dims
[49:53.680 --> 50:00.080]  pull plug on climate bill now they claim this a few months ago but now the campaigning is

[50:10.800 --> 50:15.720]  and that now the campaigning must begin and of course they're using the race card right
[50:15.720 --> 50:21.000]  now both sides are Republicans and Democrats are having race war volleys in the political
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.080]  arena but dims pull plug on climate bill Senate Democrats pulled the plug on the climate
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.840]  legislation yesterday pushing the issue off into an uncertain future ahead of midterm

[54:54.760 --> 54:59.360]  video the 9-11 terror attacks i wish that passenger would spot the big central banks
[54:59.360 --> 55:05.680]  robbing us or would spot all the police state stuff happening qmi agency columnist joe warmington
[55:05.680 --> 55:11.600]  on his way to cover the conrad black story in florida was on the same plane when another
[55:11.600 --> 55:16.360]  passenger alerted the flight crew after they spotted the young boy oh he's definitely dangerous
[55:16.360 --> 55:21.120]  watching video on his ipod of planes smashing in the world trade center so the media could
[55:21.120 --> 55:26.840]  show this all the time but you can't be watching it on your ipad or our iphone just citizens
[55:26.840 --> 55:33.560]  that are bad just before the plane took off for u.s. airspace air canada officials confirmed
[55:33.560 --> 55:40.520]  that the son of the two passengers a man and a boy were watching the video the 9-11 attacks
[55:40.520 --> 55:46.080]  before flight ac 922 departed tuesday night other passengers and crew became concerned
[55:46.080 --> 55:52.320]  air canada spokesman patrick fits patrick told the son wednesday the passengers were
[55:52.320 --> 55:56.720]  deplaned following investigation allowed the travel wednesday morning they were allowed
[55:56.720 --> 56:01.440]  isn't that nice safety and security are as well as comfort of all our passengers and
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.520]  crew is always our top concern we take whatever steps we need necessary to provide safe secure
[56:05.520 --> 56:10.960]  comfortable environment the air canada employee told washington warmington at the first man
[56:10.960 --> 56:16.520]  tried to cover up the video and staff tried to talk to him who even more evil it made
[56:16.520 --> 56:21.920]  everyone nervous oh yes the employee said adding the entire incident may have been a coincidence
[56:21.920 --> 56:25.360]  i don't know if it was the right decision the employee said but better safe than sorry
[56:25.360 --> 56:33.760]  yes live in a stasi thought crime system peel regional police constituency constabulary
[56:33.760 --> 56:39.560]  as samantha newles said officers assisted the airline with the complaint meeting the
[56:39.560 --> 56:42.840]  two passengers at the gate when they were taken off the plane investigators found no
[56:42.840 --> 56:48.360]  criminal offense had taken place she said newles said that she couldn't confirm the two were

[56:52.920 --> 56:58.520]  set out on the next flight she said the terror video scare wasn't the only delay on the flight
[56:58.520 --> 57:02.840]  that day oh there was lots of hysteria and fear going on passengers were told missing
[57:02.840 --> 57:07.240]  baggage was delaying the plane's takeoff even before they were told there would be a further
[57:07.240 --> 57:12.160]  delay due to the security problem so it's just a nittying society of being naked body
[57:12.160 --> 57:16.800]  scanned with radiation and checkpoints and army and kids being trained to title on their
[57:16.800 --> 57:22.440]  parents i see articles every week or two stories where some high school student will write a
[57:22.440 --> 57:27.800]  fiction story usually there's some age student who's done nothing wrong in the right story
[57:27.800 --> 57:33.240]  about zombies or war and doesn't involve the school they get arrested because of what they
[57:33.240 --> 57:44.120]  wrote and it just goes on from there
[57:44.120 --> 57:49.480]  passenger mike barard told toronto businessman told that the whole thing was scary was a
[57:49.480 --> 57:55.160]  scary ordeal this was definitely the strangest flight of my career he said oh my gosh there
[57:55.160 --> 58:02.280]  was some missing baggage and there was a kid watching a 9-11 video oh my gosh i mean
[58:02.280 --> 58:07.480]  meanwhile there's poisons and almost all the major process foods items on record by design
[58:07.480 --> 58:12.200]  the government's poisoning the water supply on record all these diseases like cancer you
[58:12.200 --> 58:19.600]  name it are exploding and we're going into a depression worldwide and the public is
[58:19.600 --> 58:27.160]  clinging to the legs of the sturdice let's save me it was a child it was a 9-11 video
[58:27.160 --> 58:30.920]  this is the modern mind control it's the same hysteria they use to demonize the second
[58:30.920 --> 58:35.360]  amendment some old man seen cleaning their gun in their garage the police get called
[58:35.360 --> 58:41.400]  the old man has their guns taken stay where this key info coming up

[58:49.040 --> 58:53.400]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:53.400 --> 58:58.040]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number
[58:58.040 --> 59:02.680]  two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[59:02.680 --> 59:08.280]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[59:08.280 --> 59:13.480]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:13.480 --> 59:18.680]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[59:18.680 --> 59:22.880]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:22.880 --> 59:27.520]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful
[59:27.520 --> 59:31.680]  backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators

[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:55.720]  ladies and gentlemen we are live worldwide on this wednesday july 14th 2010 edition
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:03.600]  this is the most important broadcast I have ever done in my 15 years of transmission the
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:11.360]  most important broadcast I have ever done except for maybe my 9-11 2001 transmission
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:18.720]  when I laid it all on the line when nobody else would and told it like it was you have
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.680]  epiphanies you have basically brainstorms moments where you realize that you've been
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:30.640]  right about everything and the picture that was already clear becomes crystal clear crystal
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:39.480]  clear I'm going to say this succinctly there is a 100 percent chance that the United States
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:49.360]  will completely collapse into a road warrior like scenario if we do not address the problems
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:57.240]  now and point out that this is being engineered by design now this road warrior collapse will
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:03.080]  only go on for a few years it is being orchestrated to fully break the United States this is a
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:09.040]  economic slash military coup d'etat not just against the United States but against the
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.680]  entire western world the globalists have already destroyed and leveled and annihilated and
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:19.240]  decimated the third world and it's all been declassified at the IMF and World Bank Bragg
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:24.800]  and their internal memos that they have orchestrated it they are doing the exact same thing here
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:32.960]  but with a 21st century high-tech overlay this is a mega 100 percent red alert ladies
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:41.520]  and gentlemen red alert we could go into the full collapse as early as next year perhaps
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:49.360]  even sooner but within the next two years it is a 100 percent guaranteed fact that this
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:56.360]  society is completely collapsing by design and then what they have to offer after they've
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.360]  engineered the collapse and they've trained people to fully submit and accept a new way
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:08.560]  of life living under the boot of the new world order it is so important what we are going
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:13.520]  to be covering today Larry Pratt joining us on the second amendment front for 30 minutes
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.560]  later Richard Reeves for 30 minutes in studio dealing with the Napa superhighways and the
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:22.080]  toll roads that they're putting in all over the nation in the last few years there's been
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.760]  massive resistance to it so they played possum and claim that they weren't going to do it
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.040]  now they're back with the vengeance this is a key part of the globalist funding mechanism
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.160]  worldwide will be exposing that coming up as well so you'll definitely want to stay
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.520]  with us for Richard Reeves in the middle of the next hour then Larry Pratt joining us
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:44.880]  at the beginning of the third hour but I want to be extremely clear with everyone here

[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.480]  to break down and explain why I've come to this realization number one the mainstream
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.360]  media is talking about total complete collapse worse than the Great Depression everywhere
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.600]  of course they've been engineering this they hid that fact from you for the last few years
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.040]  as we told you they would but before they fully collapse our nation into the world government
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.480]  that they would announce it that is now happening this is just the last day and a half central
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:19.760]  banks start to abandon the US dollar and who could blame them is the quote singing in London

[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:29.040]  100 percent probability that we will have a complete orchestrated collapse in the united
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:35.960]  states within the next 12 to 24 months probably even sooner that's conservative if we do not
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:42.920]  realize the fight we're in if we do not face the enemy that is coming down on us hardcore
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:48.800]  i want to make something clear here barack obama is a puppet barack obama is a wicked
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:56.840]  scapegoat barack obama is a harvard cia a frontman lawyer barack obama was designed
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:04.360]  for the implosion that you are now seeing understand that the system knows there's a
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.600]  complete global realignment against tyranny they know there's a worldwide awakening against
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.960]  the new world order their own policy reports and zbigniew brzezinski admit that and they
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:19.840]  are going to try to play the tea parties the populist the constitutional populist off
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:26.640]  against the dumbed down tv heads and basically distract us while they establish this world
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.080]  government that will be built out of the ashes of the worldwide depression they've engineered
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.280]  the end of the dollar is the world reserve currency the end of our borders the north
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.480]  american union it's all in the spp security prosperity partnership documents that were
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:48.920]  released in 2007 via the foyer lawsuit by judicial watch now the data points are the
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.640]  media is now admitting we're going into a depression all over the nation the announcements
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:59.360]  are being made that basic essential services from potholes to roads to police are just
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.600]  going to be shut off this is the same thing that's been done in the third world over and
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.320]  over again via the imf world bank receivership it's called shock therapy doctrine we have
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:14.520]  the internal imf world bank documents 2000 pages that were leaked in 2002 bbc greg palis
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:20.280]  covered it we know exactly what they are going to do they will jack up the taxes but cut
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:25.080]  out all the services they will at least triple the prices of water they will put toll roads
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:30.160]  on every major road eight thousand road miles of road in texas is their announcement just
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:35.600]  as a microcosm example this is hellish what they're going to do they're suddenly massively
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:41.040]  increasing water prices and privatizing it in australia they're suddenly doing that all
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.320]  over the united states in england it's all happening right now they're going to take
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:52.760]  your jobs and raise the prices to bankrupt you as a tool of total economic domination
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:57.560]  to them then they will come in with the new sdr global currency that will back your fiat
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.080]  currency that is simply a global currency local version it's like your driver's license
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:07.760]  is federal it just says texas or california that's the real id that was in the executive
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.520]  order 1994 by clinton implemented by 2000 you were told two years ago in 2008 this is
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:20.000]  all a strategic stated plan understand i am telling you their stated plan this is one
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  hundred percent accurate the information you are receiving this is not my opinion but now
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.640]  we have a clear image of just how hardcore they're going to slam this economy it's worse
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.840]  than i thought it is road warrior ish it is the road level that film about collapse of
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:42.480]  society and out of that collapse will come the total deindustrialization and then the
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.840]  completely managed society the collectivist society of the new world order this is their
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:54.880]  stated aim at the pentagon at the u n at the club of roam at the council on foreign relations
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:01.240]  so let's get into the information right now finally cbs news and others are reporting
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:06.360]  that every major poll shows obama has dropped to forty points at least in some polls he
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.840]  has a low thirty percent approval rating in some polls over a seventy percent negative
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:18.120]  approval rating the times of london the financial times the associated press roiders politico
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:24.520]  wall street journal new york times are all announcing that obama is politically destroyed
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:29.680]  and that he's not treading water that he is sunken beneath the waves it is a complete
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:38.000]  collapse suddenly we're seeing globalist think tanks openly speaking top clinton visor
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.560]  of course and mr. supero and others are in the news saying if we don't have another oklahoma
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:50.040]  city or nine eleven obama is done and our agenda for globalization is over so the elites are
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.160]  openly showing there's an internal debate about this we know there is saying look we've
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:58.600]  got to have a terror attack even if the nine eleven truthers and the oklahoma city people
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.480]  that have exposed that as an inside job even though they've done their work and exposed
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.080]  this and a lot of elites believe that that false flag tool has been irrevocably damaged
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:14.320]  that they've got to go with a false flag let's cover that first then we'll look at the other
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:21.560]  false flags economic military and of course environmental that they are executing and
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:28.120]  exacerbating from the oil spill the situation with iran this is going to be a perfect storm
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.600]  obama isn't meant to survive this politically and maybe not even physically and we pray
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.640]  that doesn't happen he is meant to be destroyed in the process that is what these globalists
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:45.960]  do this is how they operate now let's go over this is a prison planet dot com article directly
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:50.560]  quoting directly quoting the financial times of london that came out last night was the
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.840]  top link on the drugs report at about eight p.m. I was up here working one of the guys
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:01.400]  came over and handed me the article with it highlighted and then I had to air and post
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.280]  it and then Paul Watson to the story this morning so so this is getting major attention
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:12.000]  and that's good top clinton official only a terror attack can save obama then Watson
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.160]  chillingly with his precise research goes through all the previous statements of the
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:24.440]  think tanks calling for staged terror attacks now let me actually just read to you from
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:32.320]  the financial times of london itself so you can see this here is the financial times of
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.360]  london and this story is now the official talking point there are hundreds of papers
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:44.640]  all simultaneously reporting this worldwide today so they are purposely destroying obama
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:50.280]  they are purposely admitting he has collapsed and saying he needs a terror attack listen
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:56.600]  to this quote okay this is by mr. Shapiro top advisor to bill clinton and advisor to
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:02.600]  rock who's saying obama the bottom line here is that americans don't believe in president
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:07.800]  obama's leadership says rob Shapiro another former clinton official and supporter of obama
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:13.960]  he has defined some way between now and november of demonstrating that he is a leader who can
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:20.520]  command confidence and short of a 9-11 event or oklahoma city bombing i can't think of
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:30.880]  how he could do that now i just read you that quote i just went over that quote for you
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:41.280]  here on air now you dovetail that with the mindset of these people and with the pentagon
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:48.120]  just four years ago or three years ago under rumsfeld donald rumsfeld and they released
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:52.360]  the audio tape of this with these top generals saying sir we need another 9-11 we've got
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.600]  to have it or our agenda is going to stall and he said yeah but that's tough that's tough
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:05.720]  to do he comes within a bible page just just microscopic thin membrane thin distance of
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:11.320]  saying they stage 9-11 is so incredible to to see them and you see all these neocons
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:16.160]  writing headlines about how great 9-11 was having another one internal republican party
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:21.160]  chairman that came out in the news a few years ago saying we need another 9-11 or mccain
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:28.480]  won't get elected you see this is bipartisan this is their crisis creation mentality but
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.120]  it is so important to get this report out to everyone top clinton official only a terror
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.360]  attack can save obama now i'm going to go back into this in a moment but here is another
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:45.640]  report the october surprise is coming and of course it is a fox news outsider wins alabama
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:51.640]  g.o.p governor nomination self-described outsider robert bentley won alabama's republican nomination
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:57.760]  for governor tuesday night over established candidate bradley brine with a strong showing
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.640]  in rural areas see people are going and voting out democrats who are seen as establishment
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.320]  specter in the primary republicans that are seen as establishment running against rand
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:19.480]  paul he wins in kentucky hawaii utah colorado massachusetts you know the cases this is not
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.440]  one party in favor one party out of favor the reason the system is panicking they can
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:28.640]  always just exchange take a left step take a right step nobody ever looks at the body
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:33.360]  these legs are carrying or the brain the global central banks they look at the legs or they
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.720]  look at the wing the left wing of the right wing not the bird the wings are attached to
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.400]  that's what we focus on here is this carrying crow is this buzzard this vulture this blood
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:52.520]  drinking corrupt parasitic vampiric system of oppression and and corruption so the reason
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.320]  they're in panic mode is and i told you this year and a half ago because i saw republicans
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:01.280]  and democrats being booted every town hall the media spun and said it was just the leftist
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:06.080]  again getting ready to scapegoat obama the left's doing that because they're all part
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.440]  of the same power structure fox news and the right wing are playing along with that and
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:15.040]  they're trying to manage it imposes anti-establishment so they can hold on the only one that's done
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:20.800]  it is rick perry so far he's the only person to win as a as an incumbent in a primary in
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.240]  the last year and a half because he started claiming he was shooting coyotes in the city

[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:25.280]  Richard Reeves in studio when I get on air and I tell you this is one of the most important
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.520]  if not the most important broadcast I've ever done it's just all the facts around on the
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.840]  table everything we predicted everything we got from the globalist documents and think
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.840]  tanks and leaks is just confirmed this is their plan this is their program the designed
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.360]  collapse of society and I'm going to talk about that collapse and how we can fight against
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:49.080]  this by exposing the culprits and the fact that it is by design they're going to collapse
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:54.320]  society blame their puppets and then offer their solution of even more tyranny and the
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:59.680]  nanny state and the carbon tax control system through the crisis they're now orchestrating
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:04.480]  I'm going to cover that in a moment but first I cannot illustrate to you the viewers and
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.200]  listeners of this radio broadcast and the folks watching in prison planet dot tv that
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:15.440]  this report by paul watson reporting on what was said in the financial times of london
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:24.920]  yesterday is so essential top clinton official only a terror attack can save america a former
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:29.920]  senior advisor to president bill clinton says that the one thing which can rescue barack
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:35.600]  obama's increasingly tenuous grip on power as his approval writing continues to plunge
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.120]  is a terror attack on the scale of oklahoma city or 911 another startling reminder that
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:46.520]  such events only ever serve to benefit those in authority buried in a financial times article
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.680]  about obama's growing credibility crisis and fears on behalf of democrats that they
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:55.560]  could lose not only the white house but the senate and the house to republicans robert
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:00.760]  Shapiro makes it clear that obama is relying on an october surprise in the form of a terror
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.960]  attack to rescue his presidency and an attack on iran is a terror attack that'll drive up
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.680]  oil start real terror attacks iran sure to strike back and it's going to be hellish they'll
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.360]  be able to crack down on political dissent take over the web as they've been saying
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:18.640]  they need this new cyber security bill to shut the web off during a war you can see it all
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.880]  coming together this is the greatest danger this country has been in since its foundation
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:29.520]  since we were battling to start the country here's the quote the bottom line here is
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.200]  that americans don't believe in president obama's leadership said Shapiro adding quote he has
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:40.160]  to find some way between now november of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.960]  and short of a nine eleven event or an oklahoma city bombing i can't think of how he could
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:51.040]  do just that this is why we talk about states terror so much because it is the ace in the
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:58.360]  hole it is the royal flush it is the major trump card that they play and and by exposing
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:05.040]  this we're able to stop these people and the fact that the public is starting to wake
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:08.720]  up i went over and saw my parents late last night i was driving home at about ten and
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:12.320]  i got the book in the car i forget the title but but it's the best-selling new york times
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:18.920]  number one best-selling author who wrote midnight in the garden of good and evil and my dad's
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:24.160]  like this book is about stage terror you know the book title deals with a theater fire that
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.880]  happened in venice but it talks about how it's it's nonfiction how he met with the elite
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:33.560]  of italy and the prime minister and others who i know on record exposed that our government
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.280]  states terror attacks in italy in the seventies and eighties to blame on their political enemies
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:41.640]  it's called operation gladio but the point that a new york times number one bestsellers
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.840]  new book out that's already a new york times bestseller and i meant to bring it in in fact
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:52.560]  guys will you grab my keys and run out it's in the passenger seat of my car that that
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:28:01.080]  my dad just you know grabs you know literature or i mean top nonfiction book and within fifteen
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:07.080]  pages it's a book really about false flag terror i mean it's just everywhere you go
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.640]  see movies like children of men it's all about the government staging terror attacks and
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:18.240]  putting a sterilization chemical into the population i mean most movies i see now even in fiction
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:25.680]  so so the point is there's been a huge awakening to the fact that all of this is going on there
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:34.360]  has been a renaissance in understanding almost a revelation in understanding of this and everywhere
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:39.120]  i see it in popular culture and this is not just the system conditioning us this is people
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.840]  rebelling who are authors and artists and filmmakers i mean i talked to a lot of these
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:51.560]  people and of course it's the city of falling angels by the author of midnight in the garden
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:57.280]  of good and evil and the new york times says a urbane and beautifully fashioned book number
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:03.800]  one new york times bestseller john burnett i hope i'm pronouncing that right and here
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:12.920]  it is and it is it's just so incredible that on page ninety two it it talks about operation
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:17.280]  gladio and how the italian prime minister talked to him about our government stages
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:23.560]  terror attacks to set up a police state and of course the same italian prime minister
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.240]  has gone public two years ago saying nine eleven's an inside job that's not in the book
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:33.840]  at least as far as we know we haven't gotten through the book yet but just a side point
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:41.400]  example of how the awakening to false flag terror is really exploding we're gonna come
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.120]  back if the most important information in this whole grant that i'm laying out and how

[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.840]  we will stage terror attacks and we went and talk to him and he said yeah i said that i
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:56.520]  wrote him the letter now this is gary hart who wrote up the homeland security plan in
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.640]  nineteen ninety three with bill clinton this is the guy at the council on foreign relations
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:04.920]  in two thousand with the heart redmond commission that wrote up the current plan we're living
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:11.240]  under he said we're going to use this disaster nine eleven to establish a new world order
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.080]  remember that quote in fact people won't believe it you guys when you get a chance i don't
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:21.000]  need it right now search engine the term on youtube it'll be for my films but uh... was
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.120]  on c span it'll be uh... gary hart uh... says use nine eleven for new world order and it's
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:32.280]  him sitting at a desk we need to use this disaster for what the president's father uh... called
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.080]  a new world order
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:40.840]  that's an exact quote uh... so that's why it's so important to get this article out top
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:46.680]  clinton official only a terror attack can save obama what i've been saying for the last
[01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:51.640]  six months when he went down below fifty percent approval rating now at forty and dropping
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:59.200]  a point or so every week in freefall i said only a terror attack a huge stage war will
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:04.840]  work uh... some other type of natural disaster we're now seeing that man made natural disaster
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:08.800]  some man made disaster that's now a disaster in nature i guess will be the proper way to
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:16.640]  put it uh... a uh... environmental disaster a border disaster notice how they tell arizona
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.440]  we're not going to let you fix that problem the thousands of dead you're the kidnapping
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:26.720]  capital of the united states now uh... over eighty miles the country off limits to citizens
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.120]  and obama told senator kyle a month ago we can't let it get better we've gotta let it
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:35.640]  collapse so we can have a north american union so we can have legalization of the illegals
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:40.400]  wanted the bank canada meeting two thousand sixty classified two thousand seven say we
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:47.200]  will use border crises to merge canada and mexico into a unified security perimeter around
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:52.320]  the north american continent from alaska to the southern border uh... of mexico with
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:59.440]  guatemala don't let a good crisis go to waste this is their methodology we have their playbook
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:06.360]  we know they think you're so stupid and so pathetic that they will sit there all over
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:09.920]  the news i mean watchings got a bunch of examples of them in the news saying obama needs another
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:18.280]  oklahoma city or another nine eleven with the the the thinnest of veiled threats the
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:25.520]  i described earlier is as thick as a bible page i mean it is c through one hundred percent
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:30.480]  and they are desperate and they are using every crisis they can remember people say
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.240]  well this crisis the oil is going to destroy obama the collapsing border and the lawsuit
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.160]  against arizona is going to destroy obama obama socialist health care it's so unpopular
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.920]  over seventy percent polls when they passed it were against it even higher now the media
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.400]  puts out whitewash polls of sixty percent or so fifty five sixty why would he do this
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:56.840]  because his job is to take all the heat you know my parents have a cockatoo and the cockatoo
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:04.680]  is the new world order here's my parable or or or or analysis analogy and they put bird
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.560]  cage liner in every couple of days they put the austin america statesman newspaper local
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.160]  paper in the in its therefore it's droppings and for the food it doesn't eat the drop
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.800]  and the bird waste about half the food each plays with it there's all this food and crap
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.080]  at the bottom of it and barack obama is the bird cage liner and the new world order is
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.200]  crapping on us and dropping food on us and we're blaming the bird cage liner and it's
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:33.400]  nasty and it's gross and it's ugly and it's but still the bird is the issue towards w
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:41.640]  a bush bird cage liner here's another analogy or another parallel to what we're talking
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:49.720]  about we're always focusing on the red cape we're the bull well we're smarter than a
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:56.200]  bull but we don't act like that and the matador uses that that red and he comes up and throws
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:01.080]  little darts in the back of the bull to get the bull out of sorts angry one dart is the
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:06.240]  oil spill another dart is the imploding economy another darts the open borders another dart
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:11.040]  is socialist health care another dart is police refusing to stop criminals now openly this
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.400]  is always been the policy in the last hundred years now it's just public so they're throwing
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:20.720]  all these darts in and we just get in rage with anger and now he gets out his red cape
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:27.520]  and he likes to toy with us and so the bull runs by and he he laughs and roses are thrown
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:34.480]  to him by the people in the stands around him in Barcelona the whole world is a stage
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:40.160]  each of us players upon it and Shakespeare said and we charge through and and and that's
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:44.200]  the equivalent of them openly saying we need a terror attack in the newspaper these these
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.760]  ignorant fools will never even notice what we're talking about you know Gary Hart's writing
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:51.760]  public letters about how they stage terror attacks thinking we're too stupid to understand
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:39:00.320]  it it's it's all just a little inside joke to them and so the Matador does that and then
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.320]  finally the bulls got snot coming out his nose he's angry he's exhausted this bull fights
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:12.080]  gone on for 35 minutes and the Matador pulls out his sword long and sharp and he puts the
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:21.400]  red cape out and the bull charges and he steps aside and the bull impales itself the Matador
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:26.040]  with precision stands before the neural order crowd and they cheer him and they throw the
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:31.320]  rose petals at him and the senioritas want to go out with him that night and everybody
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:39.200]  buys him drinks at the bar and he's wealthy he's the star I don't focus on Barack Obama
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:45.400]  the red cape I don't focus on George W. Bush or Sarah Palin or Glenn Beck being set up
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:53.520]  for a fall the bird cage liner I focus on the bird I focus on the Matador I focus on
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:40:02.800]  the head the brain the system the control arm the philosophy and if we are able to expose
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:10.520]  this paradigm to people if we are able to reveal this to the population if we are able
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:16.440]  to cause a exponential viral understanding and common sense awakening to these tools
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:23.160]  that are used and point people at the mountains encyclopedia on top of encyclopedia of admissions
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:27.120]  because the elite you know there's tens of thousands of high level minions that orchestrate
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:32.920]  this for the few hundred elite or it's even less really if you break it down Roth Cop
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:38.400]  the head of the Kissinger group in his best-selling book called the superclass of their 6000 mega
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:45.480]  managers and less than a hundred owners they can't get away with this if you're aware of
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:50.320]  them but they have to communicate with their 6000 operatives so it's all out there it's
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:55.920]  all there for you if you'll just go pick their playbook up you know in the NFL they guard
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:00.080]  those playbooks the globalists think you're so stupid they leave playbooks laying around
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:05.840]  all over the place for you but you're too busy listening to the latest Mel Gibson family
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:11.160]  spat you're too busy watching big people fall that you think are big and feeling good about
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:15.800]  yourself you're too busy making fun of Lindsay Lohan and feeling powerful when she fails
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.720]  in this human you're too busy worshiping LeBron James who has the chosen one tattooed
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:26.040]  blasphemously on his back and on a power trip thinking he's a god life will guarantee
[01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:31.040]  show him that he's just a man in the beginning of wisdom is being humble and realizing we're
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.560]  all just humans but together through our species and through doing the right thing that's what
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:40.000]  gives us beauty and power and strength and honor not being a bunch of arrogant skin
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:49.280]  deep fools so we are at this crossroads right now and I want to play for you the clip from
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:55.280]  c span this was just a few days after 9 11 with the heart Rudman CFR commission talking
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:02.240]  about using 9 11 for a new world order here it is there is there is a chance the president
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:08.400]  of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father a phrase his father
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:14.320]  used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world order new world
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:25.440]  coming America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack on our homeland and our military
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:35.160]  superiority will not entirely protect us Americans will likely die on American soil possibly
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:40.640]  enlarged yeah that's a clip from road to tyranny the worst resident ever seen somebody put on
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:45.240]  YouTube you can see it in high quality and my film road to tyranny on DVD three hour
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:50.400]  film breaking down their operations from 2002 and you watch that film today eight years later
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:54.200]  it's more pertinent today than when I made it because almost everything that we broke
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:59.800]  down has now come true these films get more powerful with time they're evergreen they
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:04.400]  just keep coming and getting stronger that's why we're having an exponential effect on
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:09.320]  the new world order just is there is age just well let's play it again actually since you
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.320]  I mean I mean let's go ahead and play it go ahead and play it again or a phrase his father
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:20.120]  used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world order new world
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:29.200]  coming America will become increasingly vulnerable to hostile attack okay on our homeland and
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.560]  right there he's reading from a council on foreign relations report they'd written a
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:38.920]  year ago a year before 9 11 about how there were going to be huge terror attacks and life
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:46.360]  would change forever and within 15 minutes of the attacks on CNN Fox CBS NBC ABC all
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:50.800]  channels they had globalists with the same talking point our life has changed the new
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:54.240]  world order is here you're gonna have to give your rights up we're gonna have to attack
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:59.160]  Iraq and Afghanistan they had their talking points ready now three's the charm let's play
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:05.400]  it from the start go ahead and play it again there is a chance for the president the United
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:11.920]  States to use this disaster to carry out what his father a phrase his father used I think
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.600]  only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world order okay new world coming
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:22.680]  all right let's go ahead now and play the clip of Sanchez on CNN two days ago talking
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:28.560]  about the horrible bombings in Africa and saying well this is actually helpful to understand
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:33.000]  how evil the Muslims are and if that's the case so be it again this is their mindset
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.720]  you got to think like the enemy and this guy is showing off to the CIA officer who's smiling
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:44.280]  when he says this that hey I'm on the inside you know I'm Sanchez from from CNN I understand
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:49.680]  these things this is this is their their sick culture here it is but you know what's interesting
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:59.080]  about this in a strange way the event is helpful to the cause of those of us who know how sadistic
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:05.920]  these fundamental radical Islamic terrorists are and if it helps get the message out there
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:15.360]  that these are not the good guys then so be it now folks I'm not saying that there aren't
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.640]  extreme Muslims and that part of that culture and sex of it do want to take over I don't
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:29.480]  want to live in Saudi Arabia I mean I don't want to live in areas like Somalia but the
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:34.480]  point is our government went in after World War two on record and radicalized Muslims
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:40.440]  as a bolster against communism and use the turban-headed guys that mutilate women and
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.480]  and and and you know do all that as a way to overthrow secular mainline governments they
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:50.320]  didn't want big glistening buildings and swimming pools and jet airplanes in the Middle East
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.520]  and Central Asia they don't want First World Nations that is their set policy in the Royal
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:46:02.120]  Commission on population 49 on State Department Miranda 200 from 1973 and literally hundreds
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:06.000]  of other declassified government documents from the U.S. and England that we've read
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:12.640]  here on air the point is they have forged radical Islam and supercharged it and opened
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:18.840]  doors for them and protected them in many cases or funded groups to fund terrorist and
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:23.960]  then open the door for them to attack and that's just a fact because they get more power
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:28.480]  and control and when you and when we got the my act and Homeland Security reports a year
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.120]  and a half ago who was the number one target of the federal government Homeland Security
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.680]  and by the way this was a reissue and so something put out in Bush's last year but the right
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.280]  wing picked it up to say Obama did it well no he did do it he continued it and accelerated
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.520]  it but they're all part of the same team that's the big message that's the big issue here
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:52.920]  that everybody has got to understand right now is that that my act at Homeland Security
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.840]  report that said the number one terror threat is returning veterans gun owners conservatives
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.960]  libertarians Ron Paul supporters people that want to abolish the Federal Reserve we'll
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.000]  see we're the good guys we're the people that know about the corporate criminal takeover
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.680]  of America we're the people that understand who the players are we're the people that
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:13.400]  understand the battlefield we're the people that see clearly we are the enemy all of
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:17.920]  this is for us if you've got a portrait of John Wayne hanging in your house folks you're
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:22.800]  the enemy and when I say that I mean that that is what they describe quintessentially
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:29.280]  as their enemy if you're against welfare corporate and individual if you're against corruption
[01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:35.320]  and boss hog and big city systems of oppression you're the enemy if you're red blooded you're
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:39.360]  the enemy you're the enemy because you're not going to go along with what's about to
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:48.760]  happen you can skin a buck you can run a trot line you can make homemade wine you've got
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:54.600]  a rifle a shotgun and a four-wheel drive you've got a back 40 when they collapse society you've
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:59.920]  always been the enemy what's about to happen has been prepared for decades they practiced
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:04.760]  over and over again in third world and first world and old world nations now they're going
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:09.420]  to do it in Europe England in the United States now they're about to bring in the greatest
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:14.360]  crisis to establish their world government and if you could skin a buck and run a trot
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:18.440]  line and you're not going to turn your guns in ladies and gentlemen you're the ones they're
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:22.440]  coming after you're the ones they've tried to twist the police to the dark side to think
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:27.440]  you're the enemy but we're waking up the police and military and the globalist have overreach
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:32.200]  and we've got a good chance to blow up the death star and I mean that figuratively their
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:37.460]  whole system we are inside the superstructure right now ladies and gentlemen and we are
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:44.800]  going in towards the reactor and it is balls to the walls 110% this is it this is history

[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:52.120]  beside you now I want to be clear here they have decided that you're coddled you're decadent
[01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:56.280]  you're obsessed with the system you're scared they can hold your pension funds hostage a
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:00.440]  year and a half ago and steal trillions of dollars with a bailout and they think you'll
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:06.080]  accept losing part of your pensions to quote keep them all of this is being announced now
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:11.360]  they think that when they implode society and the police stop showing up at your house
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:16.040]  that you're going to panic and become even more domesticated and say I'll take carbon
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:21.960]  taxes I'll do whatever you say just turn the economy back on I'll accept a war with
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.360]  Iran just turn the economy back on they are holding you hostage with the border what did
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:31.400]  Obama tell Senator Kyle we can't fix the border and all the deaths in the kidnapping because
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:36.280]  we need that as a crisis to get amnesty which is the North American Union the guest worker
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:41.480]  program the wide open system it's all stated by the public CFR report that they admit is
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:47.440]  word for word the legislation that Bush introduced three times and that Obama's introduced it's
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:53.120]  word for word the same it's congruency between them it just continues and they know you're
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:58.320]  waking up and they know there's been a realignment and so you think about the magnitude of that
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:03.000]  because not only is Oakland cutting cops and holding people hostage and saying we won't
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.880]  respond to robbery and muggings and poison it says if you poison someone they won't
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:14.280]  respond and sabotaging power polls I mean this is insane this is actually under the
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:20.000]  patriot act but they're not going to enforce it because they want increased pay they want
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.800]  increased money they're holding you hostage they're saying we're not going to fix the
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.000]  roads we're not going to put new police radios in we're not going to do anything unless you
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.480]  capitulate and thumb print to get guns and they're actually increasing funding for anti
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:36.280]  gun programs in California I've talked to people I know that live in very wealthy neighborhoods
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:41.120]  of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills and major roads wash out a year ago they don't fix them
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:44.520]  now they just shut roads they've announced in the LA Times they're not going to fix major
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.760]  roads and sidewalks a few months ago the same thing is happening all over the country remember
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:55.800]  that story out of Ohio where they've laid off from 112 deputies to 49 and the sheriff
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:01.920]  was honest there he said buy guns we can't protect you one deputy to respond to calls
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:10.280]  every shift of the other 43 or 49 they are all to work at the jail and revenue generation
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:16.080]  so police starting in Chicago about a hundred years ago in New York in the last 70 or so
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:20.560]  there's the memos have even come out that have been in the news and a police chief got
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.920]  recorded what 20 something years ago in Chicago saying we're here to increase crime we don't
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:30.040]  want to keep violent offenders we want to get nonviolent and we want that we need some
[01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:34.600]  criminals out there to scare the public to thinking they need us notice the more cops
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:39.240]  we get we've got three times conservatively the police station why we had 15 years ago
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:45.800]  they've tripled or more but suddenly folks I had my car stolen what 15 years ago in Dallas
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.240]  then it got stolen a second time I'd go up there and visit a girlfriend got stolen twice
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:56.360]  from a decent area Dallas the police wouldn't even show up wouldn't even show up to her
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:02.320]  apartment when it happened and now they're just being public about the fact that they're
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.720]  there for revenue generation and they're going to let society collapse and these are coming
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:12.840]  in from Florida these are coming in everywhere they're saying burglary theft embezzlement
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:22.200]  grand theft extortion embezzlement attempted extortion false personification of other injured

[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:06.920]  the country every day i see reports where they're announcing they're laying off a third a half
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:12.520]  or more or more of the police and saying the police are only allowed to revenue generate
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:17.880]  we will not respond to robberies to muggings to home invasions buy a gun at least in ohio
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:21.920]  in michigan where they've announced this they're saying buy a gun not in california they're
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:26.000]  saying you're not gonna have a gun we're gonna try to restrict that and we're not gonna protect
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:32.440]  you unless you accept higher taxes they raise the taxes and the economy implodes they know
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:37.000]  it's going to do that and they want to get all the parasites and all the dependence and
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.480]  all the little thugs that enjoy their petty power through the system and the and the uniforms
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:48.840]  that they animate they want to get them all riled up and scared so that they will go along
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:53.400]  with the oppression that's coming they are going to shut off the power they're gonna
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:58.320]  increase the water prices they are going to drive you into submission they've done this
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:04.280]  in the third world it's called shock therapy this is a stated program one hundred percent
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:11.920]  and we know what they are doing and it is treason it is outrageous those police officers
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:17.320]  should walk off the force and say we're going to protest until you say that we're gonna respond
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:22.760]  to crime again we have triple the cops we had fifteen years ago conservatively they're
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:27.200]  trying to expand them again with taxpayer money and you can't get a cop when you need
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.800]  one most of the time in these big mega cities a lot of towns are still decent austin when
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:37.440]  i've needed the police they've come out and been very nice done a good job but more and
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.840]  more in other areas of the country and we see where you you call the police to your
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:46.840]  house there's been a break in and they taser and beat up an old woman on squad car video
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:50.240]  and in this latest case they did the right thing and fired the cops but who are these
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.800]  lunatics they're hiring we obviously need police i know it's a tough job but we need
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:03:02.400]  a smaller lean focus serious force that tracks down violent offenders and keeps them in jail
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:08.000]  i mean now in oakland here's the bigger issue what happens when the oakland police chief
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.720]  announces they won't respond to burglary theft embezzlement grand theft auto grand theft
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:23.760]  dog identity theft extortion attempted extortion administer exposed poison to another vandalism
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:29.040]  what what is that message i mean it's almost like devils night or something in detroit
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:32.920]  where all the criminals go out and burn things at once so the police can't respond this is
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.120]  the police saying we're going to take a hike just like new orleans instead the cops were
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:42.400]  tying chains to jewelry stores and pawn shops stealing guns and jewelry and dragon safe down
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.800]  the road behind them and going into walmart and kicking everybody out looting so the
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:50.240]  cops can walk out with big screen tv's i'm not here bashing police i know they're the
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:54.960]  good the bad and the ugly they're a mix like everybody else but they recruit slime they
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:00.560]  recruit scum they recruit people with low IQs that's on record in many police departments
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:06.400]  you can't have above an average IQ because with wisdom most the time comes decency and

[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:05.480]  in the rest of this segment and then more coming up later in the hour after richard
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:09.720]  grease leaves us but that's also a big part of the solution when he's going to be here
[02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:15.440]  talking about what the biggest issue is being awake and the a big part of that is realizing
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:20.440]  how much power the individual has the establishment wouldn't be moving to curtail the internet
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:24.480]  and openly censor quote conspiracy theories and they give the example at the white house
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:32.000]  and fcc of denying man made global warming or denying the official story of nine eleven
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.880]  or denying the official story of oklahoma city or denying w m d's or they call it a
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:40.800]  conspiracy theory that china sells organs when china's on record saying they do these
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.920]  are the things the state department and the fcc and the diversities are at the white
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.920]  house have all said what cast some senior regulations are has said why would they want
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:53.840]  to start shutting down free speech and curtailing talk radio free speech for the fairness doctrine
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:11:01.680]  if that's if we weren't having an effect and i'm only one person in this fight against
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.440]  the new world order the real power of this radio broadcast is you taking action and if
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:10.320]  we're able to expose that the private central banks orchestrated the collapse if we're able
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.520]  to expose their line about w m d's with iran just like they did seven years ago with
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:19.080]  iraq if we're able to expose the fact they're holding his hostage with the open borders
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.760]  and that it's their policy to have them open their arrogance is what's gonna undo them
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:28.200]  that obama admits he wants the crisis to get worse that they're trying to bankrupt states
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:33.040]  with unfunded mandates so they can be federalized and thus internationalized all of this is
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:37.560]  admitted and they want you to feel powerless but ladies and gentlemen i know the power
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:41.280]  of the individual fifteen years ago when i first got on air i just wanted to fight for
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:45.840]  the second amendment be one voice of millions i never had any imagination even having a
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:51.400]  radio show did an access show for a few months local station went to talk they said we'd
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:54.280]  like to give you a saturday show you got a lot of listeners and ratings they gave me
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:59.600]  a weekday show then it got syndicated thirteen years ago that's another example when i started
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:03.720]  info wars dot com and prison punna dot com i had no intention of them being the number
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:09.800]  one alternative websites number one and number two in the world and growing exponentially
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:14.600]  but it just shows with how you just start resisting in a small way that's how you'll
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:20.560]  get better and there's so many of us that we're unstoppable if we take action now again
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:24.720]  think about just what i've done with the films hundreds and hundreds of millions of free
[02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:30.920]  views online that's what i value is waking people up the obama deception for the republic
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:36.600]  uh... in game all of these films invisible empire truth rising loose change final cut
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:41.560]  that i produced all of that hundreds and hundreds of millions conservatively i have
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:46.000]  more than eight youtube channels with more than a hundred and fifty million views between
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.440]  them not counting the thousands of other channels and hundreds of millions of views that's just
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:56.520]  with youtube and we use other tools talk radio everything the news websites think of what
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:02.000]  we've done and here's just a few examples of why enemy operatives co until pro are revealing
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.420]  themselves in the fake patriot movement that is areas that are fake in the mainstream media
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:12.080]  multiple builder bird group journalist openly attacking me every week and international
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:16.640]  publications saying i'm a dangerous enemy because i've analyzed their attack profile
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:20.360]  i know what they're doing and i know how to stop them and here's just an example of the
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:26.360]  power of the individual and how it ties together with you the listeners how it ties together
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:31.360]  with you the power the reason the show has powers because i take action we put out quality
[02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:37.000]  information but that's a small part of the equation you magnify a billion times no exaggeration
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:42.400]  a billion times conservatively you magnify what i do an example of that is i came in
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:46.400]  her last week and told the crew and then said on air that it was weird i was listening
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:51.080]  to a syndicated show out of san antonio they were talking about me in a positive way and
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:55.640]  then i flipped the channel to five ninety a.m. and the todd and don show had a caller call
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:59.000]  in and said they want to censor the internet the world government's taking over they want
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.960]  to shut down alex jones and you know the local host made a joke about it but the point is
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:10.200]  that that was just in a few minutes of listening i was tuning channel to channel jaren called
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:13.640]  me this morning about nine he said you won't believe what just happened to me this morning
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:19.160]  because he just woken up and he was dazed by it because every piece of media his cell
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:24.960]  phone his computer his radio it was all alex jones no matter what he flipped to not twice
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:30.240]  in a row three times in a row and that's an example of you the callers just calling
[02:14:30.240 --> 02:14:37.280]  in to talk radio and the type of magnification that it is having and the buzz that is creating
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:42.440]  if we take that model and you do that yourself in your own town your own city it may just
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:48.720]  be a buzz on your block it may be a buzz in your town or your state resistance is victory
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:52.960]  and i want to go to jaren nighart and talk about this jaren briefly tell folks what happened
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:56.480]  this morning yeah actually i woke up about eight o'clock always set my alarm clock to
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:15:03.040]  uh 93 7 a local show here in town dudley and bob and a caller actually called in uh asking
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:07.520]  if they could get you on the show they're talking about the fcc ruling uh the the the ruling
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:10.560]  against the fcc they went on for about five minutes and you know we should have them back
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:15.520]  in talking about you um i turned that off uh loaded up the joe rogan podcast which is
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:19.960]  always a staple uh started listening to that at the same time i got a text message from
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.040]  my sister saying this is all at eight o'clock in the morning uh case 101 another local show
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:28.440]  here in town was talking about you um as i was reading that i said to myself look i got
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:34.600]  to go listen to case 101 see if they're still talking about it and as i did that joe rogan's
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:39.160]  on his podcast uh talking about you doing an impression actually but talking about you
[02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:44.360]  and almost short short circled me for a second the thing was he's got people in on his podcast
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:49.960]  a ufc guy eddie bravo they all talk about you like just alex hey alex says this alex says
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:53.960]  this and everybody seems to know it was the same thing on k lbj when i heard it i didn't hear the
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:58.760]  case 101 uh part but they just talked about yeah alex comes in alex alex says this and
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:03.240]  it's almost like just uh everybody's aware i see it when you know when the dredge report
[02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:07.240]  comes out i didn't even tell you this the other day i google search every morning just new world
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:12.440]  order global governance to see what articles it comes up in and uh two days ago it sent me
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:19.160]  to a link uh a tmz link about jesse james i had no relevance to anything and i actually controlled
[02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:23.880]  f uh searched it to see where new world order popped up and somebody had posted an info war
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:29.880]  story in the comments section uh by jt coyote a couple of days ago so it's just everywhere you
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:35.000]  turn the message is getting out that's just you know just the the viral nature of it it's it's
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.680]  just kind of fascinating but and within about a minute of of itself three times today on three
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:46.440]  separate radio shows they were talking about you and and this was one after the other oh yeah i mean
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:49.640]  you're just like because i'm in the car and i go to one channel they're talking about me and i
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:54.200]  and then and then i flip to another and they're talking about me and i didn't i mean it was just
[02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:59.080]  insane and more and more that's happening and i'm hearing from family and friends and other parts
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:04.200]  of the country i'm hearing of people in other nations i'm hearing in chekol slovakia and russia
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:11.320]  and japan it's info wars everywhere and and but but but the issue is it's not about alex jones it's
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:15.960]  about the power of individuals together with an idea and how ideas are bulletproof they can kill
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:20.440]  alex jones i've been getting death threats a lot of other stuff lately but i'm not scared of that
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.440]  my mission is to defeat the new world order so my children have a future and so my great great
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:28.600]  grandchildren can look at a hologram photo of me or whatever they're looking at in the future and go
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:34.040]  you know we're proud of him you know we you know and then and then i can be an example to them just
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:39.320]  like my ancestors were an example to me and you know just like i'm proud of the fact that on my
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:44.440]  dad's side you know the captain of the mayflower you know direct descendant and then two people that
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:48.520]  got married on the mayflower on my mom's side i'm proud that i'm related to a bunch of the famous
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:54.200]  people in 1776 a lot of the famous people of course in the war of independence in texas
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:58.840]  and uh i mean i'm not sitting or tooting my horn everybody has that in their background
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:03.000]  i want my ancestors i mean i i want to keep living i don't want to die but i'm actually not even
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.960]  afraid i'm really living this is as a man i am supposed to stand up for humanity i'm supposed
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:12.280]  to stand up against evil i'm not supposed to be a coward and the weird thing is i might have been
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:16.120]  scared 15 years ago a little bit maybe scared to get in front of a crowd more than i was scared
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:20.280]  to get killed i wasn't even thinking about that now i'm not even worried and i kind of got to
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:24.120]  remember well i want to continue my mission i need to kind of look over my shoulder i need to still
[02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:29.880]  watch out but i'm not it's such an empowering feeling to know we've got the truth to know we're
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:34.280]  having a historic effect and the system is fully aware that's why they've had two separate journalists
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:39.640]  and watson's written about this in international publications write whole stories about me and
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:46.120]  how dangerous i am so literally the global rulers are in their councils saying we've got to stop
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:50.360]  alex jones but how do we do it do we poison him do we kill him no let's destroy him and call him a
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:54.200]  racist when we never do that then they have their racist groups they're funding that's on record
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:58.840]  attacking me saying you know i'm gonna sell out because i'm not a racist as if being good as being
[02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:04.520]  a racist so i mean literally ladies and gentlemen you can do the same thing at your church at your

[02:23:57.960 --> 02:24:09.800]  for clean air my friends the giant effect we've had in the exponential growth curve of our power to
[02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:15.800]  reach people is a great boon for liberty but it's also a danger because if they can successfully
[02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:23.000]  destroy alex jones they can attempt to wound the idea of the resistance and i've always attempted
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.720]  to not be in this leadership position but there's no denying it and it's it's exponential and i pray
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:33.320]  every day that god strengthens me and helps me be somewhat worthy of this position but all of us
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:39.240]  are in this special position in this time and space in the time space continuum of having a serious
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:44.520]  choice liberty or tyranny i was talking to richard reeves and other great activists that i've known
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.000]  for years who's just gone on with my encouragement and others to just do amazing things he's been
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:55.480]  to bill berg with us to cover it i had a lot of courage there and and and he's seen the power
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:25:00.600]  in the awakening and obama's approval ratings dropping the pro establishment republican losing
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:07.640]  the primary in alabama to a patriot that was just yesterday every incumbent falling by the wayside
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:11.880]  except for rick perry and he posed as one of us this is happening so i want to get him here
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:15.080]  because he's an expert on the realignment that's happening he saw it a year and a half ago as i
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:19.560]  did and also on the toll roads because they're going to have a nap the super highways they've
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:24.440]  just named they've changed the name these are international zones to raise taxes for these
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:28.680]  international groups so are the carbon taxes so we're going to discuss that after the break
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:33.080]  but richard also brought to my attention a chilling obama quote he said i'm sure you know about it
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:37.480]  it came out a week ago or so and i said no i'm not aware of it see that's why you the listeners
[02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:41.480]  and the other activists are so important none of us can know all of this or even half of it
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:48.040]  but richard you you've heard me on the show just to say and i know i'm right 100 chance they're
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:53.000]  going to fully implode things to a road warrior level many times worse than great depression
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.400]  they think because we're dependent they've gotten us dependent that we'll have to submit to them
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:02.120]  they're announcing police aren't going to respond to robberies people being poisoned people being
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:07.080]  attacked that's happening all over the country they're training us that your taxes are going up
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:11.080]  but we're going to let lawlessness take over the border's lawless obama says he wants it
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:16.920]  lawless to senator kyle so people will capitulate i mean but the good news is they're in troubles
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:20.200]  people say well what's the solution it's screaming bloody murder it's saying we know you're doing
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:25.800]  this deliberately your criminals and we know the republican leadership is involved in it as well
[02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:30.920]  and and just identifying them as the treacherous larcenist traders they are richard reeves give
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:34.600]  us the state of the union and the state of the globe from your research because you're a radio
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:40.120]  talk show host author researcher activist one of the key people fighting the trans texas corridor
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:46.120]  well alex thank you for having me on and i tell you we are in a definite uh at the edge of a cliff
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:51.160]  right here i think you're right absolutely because they do see the awakening i think we had brzezinski
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:55.480]  talk about that the global awakenings going on we had a henry kiss your quote come out
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:27:00.520]  that if the euro collapses over in the european union if that comes apart the new world order
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:04.840]  could be lost right now but i don't think they're ready to give it up that quick they are definitely
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:09.800]  ready to uh potentially pull the plug on us here and i think one thing we could discuss through the
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:15.560]  next 30 or so minutes is how they may play out those scenarios because i don't think they're
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:18.600]  going to delay the election i don't think they're going to play with that i think they're going to
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:25.160]  let that happen and i think what we might see is a lame duck session of congress where these guys
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:29.560]  is kind of like in a foreclosure situation where some people burn the house down or vandalize it
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:34.360]  heavily tear out the walls of plumbing the air conditioner etc we might see that in this lame
[02:27:34.360 --> 02:27:38.200]  duck set no that's what the imf world bank plan says they did to third world countries and they
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:42.280]  admit they're doing it to europe in the us and england australia right so that's what i'm real
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:47.000]  concerned about is that lame duck session but nonetheless we've got to do what we've got to do
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:52.520]  earlier you were talking about how that you were getting all the media coverage and the talk about
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:57.640]  alex jones info wars and the patriot movement tea party etc was just blowing up well that's one
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:04.680]  thing that i've noticed that years ago back in the late 90s early 2000 stories that were discussed
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:10.520]  here in the alternative media sometimes took the mainstream media two three four five years
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:14.600]  in some cases they didn't talk about a story that we talked about it may be too now they admit on
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:19.560]  fox and cnn prozac does cause brain cancer and heart attacks they admit okay it is causing
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:25.000]  miscarriages and for babies to be underweight and deformed with the aspartame which we knew back in
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.200]  the 70s that was in the studies i mean exactly it's just kind of out there now well when it comes to
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:35.160]  the political realities of this world the zeitgeist of it is flying right through this office because
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:41.400]  it's like just yesterday on the usa today yesterday front page full body scanners being
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:45.000]  protested against right there on the front page they're talking about a story
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.880]  where full body scanners at the airports that people are upset meeting massive resistance and
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:55.320]  it's a man and i have another report here freeway speed cameras to be turned off this is out of the
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:29:02.600]  arizona newspaper arizona republic and it says because almost everyone refused to pay over 90
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:06.760]  percent of people refuse to pay the tickets right so that's what's going to take is going to take
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:12.840]  some civil disobedience at some point uh but i think we still have uh just by hanging by thread
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:18.120]  we've got the voting still hanging by thread we had the ran paul victory we've got uh other uh
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:21.720]  victories that have happened in these primaries like you said a lot of incumbents are going by
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:25.400]  the way so we're in a fight for our lives when we come back let's go through that more talk about
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:30.760]  the different scenarios and more detail because i i i love your political analysis i think it's spot
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:36.280]  on and i'm gonna get your take on that then we'll talk about another key blood supply for this cancer
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:40.280]  is the global highways they're doing this everywhere and they're going to seize the water
[02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:44.920]  supplies that's already happening double tripling prices i mean this is a globalist rape gang
[02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:51.320]  hellbent on bankrupting you and your family we're going to feed them stay with us we're on the march

[02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:58.040]  okay and the globalist going to try to confuse you on the web and get you to end fight and
[02:36:58.040 --> 02:37:03.000]  i sort of love about richard he's immune to it and and and distract off and make the fight about
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:08.440]  a fight with each other instead of waking more people up it's a life and death situation and
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:13.720]  i want to commend all of you because we are kicking the globalist hind in but the problem is the empire
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:19.160]  is now striking back richard you've got the floor about the kissinger quote uh this obama clip the
[02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:24.280]  toll roads everything we're going to talk about solutions but also who the enemy is right now
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:28.600]  what do you want to cover first well first of all i want to back up what you just said info
[02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:33.320]  warrior is essential right now because if we have this economic collapse that you're talking about
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:39.160]  and that i think very well could be coming as well we need to have our neighbors knowing who's
[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:44.120]  really the culprit you know is it the middle class is it the uh the guy down the street no it's not
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:50.360]  it's the global elite that's doing this economic hit on the united states so we need to info warrior
[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:55.560]  times two times ten whatever you're doing now folks amp it up and the new world order they fund
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:38:01.320]  their operation out of thin air paper and ink in zeros and ones in the computer that doesn't
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:07.800]  even exist in reality that's how they fund their efforts folks alex needs help to fund these efforts
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:11.720]  and continue this going on all right i'll tell you one of the quotes i thought you'd be really
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:17.000]  interested with his oil well situation is mckell gorbachev the threat of environmental crisis will
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:22.920]  be the international disaster key that will unlock the new world order so that plays right into this
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:28.360]  old and that was published in newspapers that was a 1988 quote way back from 88 supposedly
[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:34.680]  december un general assembly read that again the threat and i would say the the implementation
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:39.720]  is probably the new word there but the threat of environmental crisis will be the international
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:45.560]  disaster key that will unlock the new world order uh marie strong quote the environmental crisis
[02:38:45.560 --> 02:38:51.960]  is the cornerstone of the new world order so uh al gore marie strong and mckell gorbachev are the
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:56.680]  three musketeers of the environmental movement so the new world order is using that leg right now
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:00.760]  but there's other legs obviously going on besides the environmental crisis but i thought with this
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:06.360]  oil well spun out in the gulf that notice it's bp very timely very timely situation and also
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.400]  to back up how you started the show today which was your warning about that it looks like they're
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:15.880]  really going to potentially pull the plug here in the upcoming months we're already in a depression
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:22.840]  but i mean total collapse potentially total collapse and obama at the g20 summit uh i heard
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:28.120]  this quote a couple times on mainstream news he's warning of uh that he's going to present
[02:39:28.120 --> 02:39:33.880]  very difficult choices to the country next year so if the guys got that that little and before he
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:37.880]  played that's what i was saying earlier they think we're domesticated they've done the math and know
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:43.160]  that 90 of people uh you know aren't self-sufficient and are dependent one way or the other on the
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:47.240]  government uh even if they don't work for the government and so they've decided to bankrupt
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:52.520]  everything to say now here's your choice fully submit to us and we know what that means so tell
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:57.240]  us about this clip we're about to see well it's a g20 clip uh when obama was there and remember he
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:40:02.760]  was encouraging other nations he's encouraging other nations to keep up the uh stimulus right
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:07.400]  that means get more into the bankers but but but then he went further he also said in a clip
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.040]  that no nation be above any other but that means lowering everyone with the bankers above us so
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:16.440]  let's go ahead and play that clip there we go you know one of the interesting things that's
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:22.040]  happened over the last 18 months as president is for some reason people keep on being surprised
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:31.400]  when i do what i said i was going to do so i say i'm going to reform our health care system and
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:37.080]  people think well gosh that's not smart politics maybe we should hold off or i say we're going to
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:43.960]  move forward on don't ask don't tell them uh somehow people uh say you know well why are you doing
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:48.440]  that uh you know i'm not sure that's a good politics i'm doing it because i said i was going
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:55.640]  to do it and i think it's the right thing to do and people should learn that lesson about me because
[02:40:55.640 --> 02:41:03.560]  next year when i start presenting uh some very difficult choices to the country uh you know i
[02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:10.760]  hope some of these folks who are hollering about deficits and debt uh step up because i'm calling
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:20.520]  their bluff uh and we'll see how much uh of of that uh how much of the political arguments
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:27.160]  they're making right now are real and how much of it was just politics all right thank you very
[02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:32.600]  much everybody boy uh your take on that oh as well uh the headline on that on youtube was
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:37.320]  obama crypt cryptidly presents very difficult choices to the country next year well that's
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:42.200]  when he first got elected that's what uh biden said he said he's going to do some things that
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:45.720]  are going to make people hate us and what they do is all the taxes are going to go to debt they're
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:49.080]  going to get rid of the police the welfare they're going to slash it all they're going to take
[02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:53.560]  pensions and that's going to be the tough choice and we see republicans in the washington time saying
[02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:58.120]  yes we need to raise the retirement age to 70 and we need to start taking part of people's pension
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:02.280]  funds so uh the bankers are going to get everything they're going to have record profits like they've
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:05.720]  had the last two years we're going to have nothing well and we got to remember he was
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:10.200]  addressing the g20 audience people that uh they're basically in the know what's going on
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:15.320]  so what i think he's anticipating is i think he's anticipating that in this general election in
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:21.400]  november we're going to see a lot of incumbents get tossed out uh probably uh for almost certain
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:26.120]  that we're going to get a republican majority in the house maybe in the senate as well 11 senators
[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:31.800]  are gone already from attrition either they've died or retired or whatever you got 40 us house
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:37.880]  members that are gone already because they have stepped out of the of the uh fire here so we've
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:44.680]  got a chance to see in 20 30 new faces potentially in these upcoming and most of these faces we know
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:49.080]  are bona fide patriots and so the globalists are going to have trouble getting them under control
[02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:55.800]  and it's exponential either way you slice it i mean did you hear me read from the financial
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:43:01.560]  times of london top clinton official only a terror attack can save obama i mean the story alone we
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:04.760]  have five years ago we talked about this for a month straight these things are coming out on
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:09.800]  an hourly basis right it's crazy uh how fast things are happening how fast things are coming
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:13.000]  out as that quote that you say all the time that sometimes things happen in a year that
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:18.280]  happened in a hundred years that rapidly but i think they're anticipating this big change in
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:24.280]  the house of senate and so obama is going to set the new freshman up for a fall they're going to
[02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:29.960]  come in and want to see uh fiscal responsibility implemented even though as we've uh your caller
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:34.680]  stated earlier uh in the last few days that the new world order has a laden's lamp when it comes
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:40.680]  to creating money well the uh there's going to be a a desire for fiscal responsibility by the
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:46.840]  new freshman coming in and so he may let that happen to a more hideous degree than even they want
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:50.920]  and then then then he's got somebody to point the finger notice all the leftist controlled areas
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:57.160]  have got you know record amounts of money but what did you think about uh oakland saying we're
[02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:01.000]  going to restrict guns more so you can't have those protect yourself but we're going to this is the
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:05.400]  police chief this is what he released you're allowed to administer poison to someone we will
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:11.160]  not respond if someone's poisoned extortion burglary theft embezzlement grand theft uh i mean it just
[02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:18.920]  goes on and on uh sabotaging power lines uh i mean this is insane and we'll put that list on
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:24.040]  screen if you scroll down on an mbc article this is his list and and and that's a green light to
[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:28.920]  the criminals to just go haywire right right and so that's what could happen is when we get this mad
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.080]  max scenario that you referred to earlier in the show then that's going to put all of us in danger
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:38.040]  that are trying to you know maintain our house payment and drive our cars and go to work etc so
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:43.320]  it could be very and they're going to offer the new s dr and say we'll jack the dollar up for you
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:47.240]  for a while because under this s dr the globals will fully run the dollar offshore now it'll still
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:52.760]  be there it's just they control it and then now you'll have this s dr uh a digital currency above
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:56.600]  that and that's going to be their answer global government will fix this and if we capitulate
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:00.920]  and roll over they'll turn the economy back on for a few years well and uh but you know we're
[02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:03.800]  going to have to go through this that's what we've got to figure out is how to transition
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:09.160]  from this funny money federal reserve system to a real constitutional money system well that's
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:13.000]  what they covered that's a very ugly path unfortunately potentially but that that's
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:16.520]  what that's the route we need to go now i want to get into toll roads but but but but but first
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:19.560]  some more of the uh and we'll keep you five minutes the next hour if we need to Richard
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:22.920]  can you have key info on the toll roads so i wanted to get you here why i called you but
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:28.840]  i want to go back to this we you read the imf 100 i think was 112 points was 2002 it got leaked
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:33.240]  and it's the shock therapy doctrine got released joseph stichlitz left and it magically got leaked
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:37.400]  the Nobel prize winner and he's a pretty good guy we've had him on and he says they plan to
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:42.280]  destroy everything and its total collapse and in there you know the imf would say go into
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:47.000]  argentina this was the one example there they just done it two years before in 2000 this is 2002
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:52.920]  we're going back to him and they said what we do is we quadruple the price of oil and water
[02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:58.120]  we put toll roads on everything that further bankrupts it then the people riot confidence
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:03.640]  is lost and then you have to make things a lot worse it's basically take them
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:09.960]  100 miles down the road we push back 50 but still they've got 50 miles on us so they know
[02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:15.160]  they have to make it super bad so that then we fight back get a little bit back and think we
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:20.280]  won when really our standard of living has been dropped by 20 30 40 50 percent which morey strong
[02:46:20.280 --> 02:46:25.000]  and the un and al gore say is their goal the carbon tax is to destroy our industrial society
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:29.240]  to make us dependent china india and others are exempt they're the new globalist command base
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:35.160]  and so they're going to wreck things so bad so that artificially so that then when they turn
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:39.560]  things back on it'll be a lot worse than it is now but we'll think oh my god at least i've got food
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:44.280]  at least the power is on at least the water is flowing and in the imf world bank plans they
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:48.920]  they they say how they do it i mean we they're doing that here this is going to happen they are
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:52.680]  and richard how do we stop it i know they're engineering it i know they're executing it
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:56.600]  i have their playbook i mean it's not like i'm i just realized now they're really going for
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:01.160]  everything they are going to hammer us into nothing and and i just want people to understand this
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:07.080]  well one way to stop it you did the plug orders get those videos in the hands of as many people
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:10.920]  as possible but the other things we can do is we still got elections coming up primaries
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:15.320]  unfortunately the texas primaries already passed we don't get another shot at firing incumbents
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:22.760]  till november but in oklahoma in oklahoma we've got we've got randy brogdon that has a good chance
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:28.840]  to run to get into the governor's primary in the republican party randy brogdon his website
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:33.560]  randy brogdon dot com he might be worthy of an interview i think uh because he's a really good
[02:47:33.560 --> 02:47:40.040]  guy and he's polling around 40 percent in some of these mainstream monkey polls so he's looking
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:46.120]  really good there and plus that creates a definite roadblock for the nafta corridor for the trans
[02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:50.280]  texas corridor they got to go through oklahoma now there's 83 of these mega highways they want
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:57.320]  but the key and they admit for the whole country to merge into is the trans texas i35 mega corridor
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:01.720]  all the way into the north of canada all the way down to the port on the pacific side in
[02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:08.360]  southern mexico right laredo texas is the largest inland port in the united states laredo texas
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:15.880]  largest inland port so absolutely the trans texas corridor is a cornerstone keystone piece of the
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:20.280]  nafta corridor it's their death star we blow that politically uh they're still gonna have star
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:24.760]  destroyers we've blown their main fleet well in november we're gonna chance to fire every get a
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:30.200]  chance to fire every incoming in texas that we possibly can that's our best hope to make changes
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:36.040]  here politically in texas up in november and then up in oklahoma we've got randy brogdon like
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:41.240]  said we've got rj harris another candidate for us rep that's got a good chance up there
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:47.080]  and then we've got james lane lane for ok senate dot com james lane is running for oklahoma now
[02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:50.440]  there are hundreds of patriot candidates people should find them in their areas and break their
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:55.720]  backs supporting them now let's tell people what the nafta highways do and then a microcosm example
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:00.520]  seizing mopac which is admittedly illegal to put in a total on an existing road every time
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:06.200]  they try it we fight back they would they retract it they're back let's use mopac as a microcosm well
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:11.720]  with mopac see the engineers that originally designed and built that figured that a lot more
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:16.920]  of that traffic on mopac would just be having downtown austin as their destination but as you
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:23.480]  well know with i-35 being congested so badly so many hours of the day then mopac has become a big
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:28.360]  through route through austin now and what they've done though is when they engineered that lady bird
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:33.960]  lake bridge used to be town lake bridge when they engineered that there's a lane that drops off on
[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:38.760]  southbound and northbound side so the good there's a little bit of good news in this uh
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:43.640]  the good news is they're going to add a third through lane both north and southbound on that
[02:49:43.640 --> 02:49:47.480]  bridge i did call kirk watson's office last week after i heard you mentioned can't believe i've
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:52.360]  already said so well i got this from sandy so we'll see hopefully they live up to it and as i
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:56.360]  understand they're already working and restriping the well it should be a free road we've already
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:00.360]  paid for it it should be completely free road three lane and kirk watson is as crooked as a barrel
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:06.440]  of snakes i tell you i've got problems with kirk watson myself but three lanes each way uh all the
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:10.440]  way through is what it's supposed to be when they get through restriping now what they are planning
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:15.240]  on still doing is that fourth additional lane call the managed lane that's going to be a toll road
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:22.040]  lane and potentially that'll help mopac marginally but it'll create a bureaucracy that will continue
[02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:29.320]  to fight to keep i-35 in gridlock i mean here we are we've got sh 130 that runs to our east that's
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:35.480]  supposed to be our bypass here in austin very underutilized millions of austinite taxpayer
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:40.360]  the point is they hold this hostage they won't build the roads and then they want to give it to foreign
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:45.480]  companies to loot us and the way i've read the law is this illegal to put toll roads on existing
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:50.120]  roads well it is but they parse those words they'll say well we're going to add these new lanes
[02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:54.600]  and so the existing road was the lanes that you had and how are you going to exit off those
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:51:00.360]  well that's i've yet to see exactly it's impossible it's impossible the engineers have said so when

[02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:26.280]  other news i haven't covered yet but the establishment is going to promote lawlessness and the collapse
[02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:31.080]  to bring in their control and getting back to to toll roads they always claim they're not going
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:35.160]  to put them in when resistance mounts and then they come back later and do put them in they've
[02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:39.880]  claimed over and over again no toll roads from opac 183 it's the same story where there's indiana
[02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:45.400]  new jersey over and over again and we know that these are sweetheart deals with these foreign
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:50.920]  companies i mean this is not privatization this is looting but from your deep research on toll
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:54.600]  roads i mean look at how a year and a half ago they announced okay no no trans texas corridor
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:59.000]  we're going to cancel it then the same article in the ap said we're just going to do it project by
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:05.560]  project to not call it that now so they play these semantical games so we don't have a united front
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:10.920]  of enemies to go after well alex you know we really have slowed them down and we've damaged them but
[02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:14.920]  they are definitely not gone and they've got that laden's lamp of money that they want to keep pouring
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:20.200]  into this the road builders are chomping at the bit for that money so they are going to continue
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:24.840]  like you said wanting to build these toll roads they want to milk the us people out of all the
[02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:28.840]  money they can get and the ones that they can't milk on being on the toll roads they're just going
[02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:33.320]  to put them on foot that's part of their plan to reduce congestion for the first time we knew it was
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:37.000]  the policy in the last 20 years but the head of the department's transportation said the new york
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.280]  times what a few months ago that they're anti car but but but america's designed for cars we're not
[02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:47.000]  compact europe or tokyo i think chicago new york are probably the only cities that you
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:51.400]  can really get by without a car well they know that though this is this is about bankrupting
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:55.640]  everybody it is i mean i mean the pentagon designed the roads we've gotten the fifties
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:58.840]  they make us all dependent on it then they try to take it away well i've been in the
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:03.960]  transportation business over 30 years now and i'm seeing more and more people be priced out of their
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:09.560]  cars literally uh when we had the price hike of four dollar gallon gas they're briefly back in 2008
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:14.520]  people were literally bailing out their cars and and riding taxis and buses because they could not
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:19.640]  afford to gas so even as expensive as a taxi was they were preferring that over driving their own
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:25.880]  vehicles so uh they've definitely got these plans to put people back on their feet as a matter of
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:32.680]  fact uh one guy jokingly said during a uh central texas uh meeting uh two three years ago he said
[02:56:32.680 --> 02:56:38.200]  that i'd like to see tolls on trails you know put tolls on trails and make people pay for walking
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:42.520]  so that's the full intention that they have at some point if they can well i mean we always joke
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:47.480]  what's the new tax attacks on air that's now they that's the new york times headline attacks on air
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:51.880]  that's carbon dioxide that's what bill gaith said we're going to tax you for breathing which by the
[02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:57.560]  way uh fellow texas on texas turf dot org terry hall's website that she's always breaking down the
[02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:01.880]  toll road issues got stories on there there's a story on there right now how that highway lobby
[02:57:01.880 --> 02:57:08.360]  wants every kind of tax possible to build roads with now they want toll roads they want additional
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:13.800]  gasoline taxes they want sales tax money they want to dip into property tax money they want to dip
[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:19.560]  into every possible tax to help fund building these highways so that's what we have to look and
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:24.440]  they always lie and say because gas receipts are going to go down they've gone up they're lying
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:29.160]  about not having money well you know we may have had might have had a small leveling off like around
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:35.240]  08 when we had the big four dollar gallon price tag but uh basically you're right even uh in
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:40.280]  down times we still get more people still driving more cars covering more miles collecting more
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:45.880]  gasoline taxes the state of texas sends billions of dollars every year and over the past decades
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:50.840]  multi billions of dollars well the point is this in europe they've admitted this and ibm's promoting
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:55.400]  this we're going to be taxed on all roads off your license plate with license plate readers
[02:57:55.400 --> 02:57:59.240]  i'd tell people this five years ago they'd laugh at me now you go on most of the toll roads and
[02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:03.960]  you're up in the us there's no toll booth if they just charge you off your off your license plate
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:09.160]  this is uh they've already got a test in texas going where people get a transponder in their car
[02:58:09.160 --> 02:58:14.840]  that tracks them and taxes them this is your cars are going to be turned into uh uh you know basically
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:20.440]  tax cab a taxi cab and notice your taxes go up but they say we got to get rid of cops they can't
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:25.720]  respond to burglary well and the best example to look at is just uh type into uh search engine look
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:31.800]  at singapore roads and study singapore toll roads and singapore tolls they've got a hundred percent
[02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:37.240]  tax on just importing a car if i remember i got stay there i mean it's all a rip off to the elites
[02:58:37.240 --> 02:58:50.280]  they're robbing you had served them thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today the question
[02:58:50.280 --> 02:58:58.040]  is where should the american people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy
[02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:03.960]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule
[02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:07.640]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:59:07.640 --> 02:59:13.800]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define who we are
[02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:19.320]  and what we will tolerate somebody's going to ask you what you did during the patriot uprising
[02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:23.960]  you have been warned we have the facts we have the constitution we have the bill of rights we have
[02:59:23.960 --> 02:59:29.160]  common law knowledge is power ladies and gentlemen and i'm so excited to be able to offer you don't

[03:00:21.720 --> 03:00:25.880]  richard reeves talk show host great political activists from here in austin texas got five
[03:00:25.880 --> 03:00:29.000]  more minutes with him and larry pratt's coming up about 30 then i'll jam in some phone calls
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.840]  phones aren't open yet though folks i'm gonna recap the top stories i mean i laid it out at the
[03:00:32.840 --> 03:00:37.000]  start of the broadcast this is the most important time in our history that we're facing and there's
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:41.800]  no doubt they're gonna slam us into a total depression to try to break our will and uh
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:46.200]  basically domesticate us and that's just the beginning of their end game uh but richard in
[03:00:46.200 --> 03:00:51.880]  the last five minutes we've got left recap and go more into how you see them breaking our will
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:57.240]  with the things they're doing right now well the big thing they do just keep on raising our taxes
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:01:01.720]  anyway possible that's a big way they do it and of course the media has been doing their job and
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:06.840]  you've covered it so well about the lebron james and lindsay lohan and all this so they just continue
[03:01:06.840 --> 03:01:11.880]  with their uh dumbing down at the education level and the public indoctrination centers
[03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:18.120]  etc i see them firing on all their weapons pretty much except uh you know hopefully not military
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:23.960]  weapons here but you've got these environmental disasters so the question is now at what point
[03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:29.400]  will they stop at what point will they back off and that's where we've got no choice but to go in
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:34.280]  as uh some of those analogies you've made in the past where like we're flying with x-wing fighters
[03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:38.680]  into the death star we've got to go in and we've got to uh fight them at every level that we can
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:45.240]  politically info warrior every little thing people do is so important because uh people get confused
[03:01:45.240 --> 03:01:49.400]  they think well this is all about obama getting reelected they could care less about him he's not
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:54.280]  the the power structure and so they're more than happy to see him destroyed they'll just move forward
[03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:59.800]  we must put the blame on the criminal elite the ruling class right the ruling class and how do we
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:04.440]  get to him that's a that's a good question you've talked about trying to and have indictments and
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:10.120]  have jury trials etc and that's definitely a way we need to go but we need to have some political
[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:14.040]  cloud up there to initiate this we've got to have judges we'll that's why they have the
[03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:20.120]  builder bar group writers that actually attacking me it's very spooky because ron and ron paul because
[03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:24.520]  we call for grand juries to indict them we're actually pointing at the real power structure
[03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:30.120]  not their puppets and they don't like that i mean folks this is death defying what we're doing well
[03:02:30.120 --> 03:02:35.320]  when we had exactly it's like we're on a high wire act is exactly right and we've got 500 feet up
[03:02:35.320 --> 03:02:40.680]  and no net that's what we're going into so that's why we need every tightrope walker we can get
[03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:46.200]  and we especially need alex jones slash ron paul types in political office at every level from
[03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:51.160]  dog catcher to senator to governor so our people are everywhere not even as a majority yet but to
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:57.720]  watch and to expose corruption everything you do is life and death now at this point it is and i'll
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:02.920]  tell you i'm thinking that we're swinging 10 to 20 percent of the vote if we were organized enough
[03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:07.720]  to at least vote against incumbents in these elections who knows how many people we could turn
[03:03:07.720 --> 03:03:14.360]  over and in that big influx of new people we're going to hurt in quite a few patriot candidates
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:18.520]  at all these different levels of candidacy all over the country and that's it like you said
[03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:23.640]  there's so many of their running everywhere and in 2012 lord willing that we get that far
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:27.080]  we're going to have even more so richard i'm going to make this final point that have you
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:31.000]  close out your statement and i appreciate you being here that i'd always seen it in the last
[03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:35.080]  four years it's really scary that the elite were all moving out of the us and they're even leaving
[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:40.520]  israel and even leaving england and moving to offshore armored islands i kind of saw it as a
[03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:46.680]  negative like they were going to destroy us which they are but that's kind of good because it looks
[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:50.440]  like they're just trying to steal everything and now they may realize they're going to finally get
[03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:55.080]  kicked out well it's looking like they're going to have to self eject because they may not have
[03:03:55.080 --> 03:03:59.320]  any choice and like you said many of them over the years you said that many of them have already
[03:03:59.320 --> 03:04:04.120]  gotten their place in the cayman islands or wherever they go to but the new world order is
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:08.680]  definitely it's global it's global so i don't know where they're going to go i don't know where
[03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:12.600]  anybody's going to go because i've looked at it i've looked at going to central america and other
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:18.280]  country well in their new world order system it's like a spider tying up its its its prey we are
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:22.280]  tied up in the red tape they're all exempt from it so that's why they only care about that global
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:28.200]  police power so they can rob nations one by one and kind of hopscotch around well but these guys
[03:04:28.200 --> 03:04:32.440]  that only have the multi millions or maybe in the low billions they're just not big enough so they're
[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:37.560]  going to end up being the victim of the spider in the web as well at some point so they might as
[03:04:37.560 --> 03:04:42.120]  well join the fight and help fund what's going on here in the united states the united states is
[03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:48.600]  definitely worth saving and i'm not leaving anytime soon that's for sure now we've got a stand here
[03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:52.280]  we've got to make our stand there's nowhere to run richard reeves always great having the end
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:56.360]  thanks a lot hey thanks alex i appreciate it and we need some more leadership on the toll road

[03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:28.120]  well the head of the only serious national organization that is no compromise on the
[03:08:28.120 --> 03:08:32.520]  second amendment larry pratt is with us about 45 after and i'll jam in some phone calls and get
[03:08:32.520 --> 03:08:38.120]  into some of our top stories but i want to talk about the second amendment situation with larry
[03:08:38.120 --> 03:08:44.840]  pratt from gun owners dot org but first i wanted to throw this out there a headline suffer these
[03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:49.640]  criminals in oakland don't call the cops and the police chief said give us more funding and we
[03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:57.000]  won't respond to burglary theft embezzlement grand theft grand theft auto extortion embezzlement
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:06.440]  by an employee poisoning administering poison to someone vandalism and it's also says sabotaging
[03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:12.600]  power lines i mean i don't know if this is an alternate dimension or something but that dovetails
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:18.440]  with a wkyc report and others we've been talking about we're 112 deputies to 49 deputies in this
[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:25.400]  ohio county but that deputy that sheriff and judge they're saying buy guns we can't protect you
[03:09:25.400 --> 03:09:29.960]  and the 49 cops they're going to keep one will be out there helping with calls the rest are all
[03:09:29.960 --> 03:09:35.640]  bureaucracy and revenue generation but out in oakland they're increasing anti gun funding wanting
[03:09:35.640 --> 03:09:42.200]  thumbprints to get ammo it's just totally insane but then we see obama telling senator kyle a
[03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:46.520]  month ago in a meeting and this is on record that senator call spoken about it that i'm going to keep
[03:09:46.520 --> 03:09:51.480]  the borders open for a crisis as the spp documents say to get amnesty so this is an act of treason
[03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:59.400]  i had arizona sheriff uh on uh babu and he said it does he said i'm in the military i can't really
[03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:05.480]  say it but it is does borderline treason to openly bring down your country obama's blocking the oil
[03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:11.080]  spill relief um the supreme court has ruled yes you can have a gun if you jump through 100 hoops
[03:10:11.080 --> 03:10:16.520]  chicago's saying 500 bucks five hours testing psychological testing can't have the gun outside
[03:10:16.520 --> 03:10:20.920]  your house so i see this as a supreme court ruling you you've got a right to basically turn your guns
[03:10:20.920 --> 03:10:25.640]  in but some say it has you know at least some effect because it says you can't outright ban them all
[03:10:25.640 --> 03:10:30.760]  so we'll talk about all that with larry pratt but now we have seeing an insane central bank start to
[03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:36.120]  abandon us dollar new york times saying what we're in a mega depression so now they're not lying
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:41.960]  about that but their answer is more government and then i have the financial times of london top
[03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:48.600]  clinton official only a terror attack and save obama uh that's what uh former top clinton advisor
[03:10:48.600 --> 03:10:54.040]  and obama advisor robert supero said the bottom line is that americans don't believe in their
[03:10:54.040 --> 03:11:00.200]  president obama's leadership uh quote he has to find some way uh between now and november of
[03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:04.600]  demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and sort of a 9 11 event
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:11.400]  and sort of a 9 11 event or an oklahoma city bombing i think i can't think of how he can do that
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:17.640]  amazing statement so we're all in grave danger ladies and gentlemen right now larry pratt good
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:22.360]  to have you with us and it could be with you thanks for having me let's take it piece by piece uh
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:28.600]  what is your view on all over the country police uh saying all the money has to go to bankers or
[03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:33.320]  bankrupt uh and we're not going to protect you anymore but you can't have a gun to protect yourself
[03:11:33.320 --> 03:11:37.560]  well there's the rub it's that can't have a gun anyway even though we're not going to
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:44.040]  do our job and what it should be is a wake up call for all of us that we can't depend on the police
[03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:51.400]  even if they're doing everything they possibly can and want to do they're just not going to be
[03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:57.240]  enough of them ever to have a cop on your shoulder you know the bumper sticker says uh
[03:11:57.240 --> 03:12:03.960]  i carry a gun because a cop is too heavy and that's i think what comes out of all this and we've
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:11.400]  got to push back on our employees who have the incredible view that they can tell us we can't
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:17.240]  have a gun to protect ourselves and tell them that either they get it figured out right or we're
[03:12:17.240 --> 03:12:23.400]  going to get somebody else in there but i mean what about the message that we're not going to
[03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:28.360]  respond to burglary home invasions uh we're not going to respond to people being poisoned
[03:12:28.360 --> 03:12:32.120]  when someone poisons them we're not going to respond to extortion we're not going to respond
[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:37.800]  to sabotage i mean this is a green light to go absolutely ape uh in oakland cal uh oakland
[03:12:37.800 --> 03:12:44.520]  california well you know even in an anti-gun jurisdiction such as chicago uh it kind of
[03:12:44.520 --> 03:12:49.640]  surprised me but the state several years ago in fact obama voted on the wrong side of the measure
[03:12:49.640 --> 03:12:56.040]  the state has a law that preempts what cities can do when someone uses a quote on quote illegal
[03:12:56.040 --> 03:13:01.000]  gun meaning it wasn't licensed but of course you couldn't get a license for it anyway and they use
[03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:08.520]  it in self-defense during a home invasion they the cities are prohibited from taking such an
[03:13:08.520 --> 03:13:16.040]  individual uh to court uh and three times in the last a couple of months uh individuals have used
[03:13:16.040 --> 03:13:23.000]  handguns for self-defense at least one case i know they shot and killed the invader nothing
[03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:29.080]  could be done by the city as bad as as daily wanted to bring charges couldn't do it and so
[03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:34.280]  that's one way to legislatively handle the problem is just make it so that you can't
[03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:39.160]  touch us if we have done something in self-defense and of course the better laws
[03:13:39.160 --> 03:13:44.440]  are those in florida and texas and some other states the the so-called castle doctrine where
[03:13:44.440 --> 03:13:49.960]  your home is your castle and they've taken the castle to mean anywhere you are so if you're out
[03:13:49.960 --> 03:13:55.320]  in a parking lot and some thug is trying to rape you and you pull out a piece and blow him away
[03:13:55.880 --> 03:14:01.960]  well that was just his bad luck and it shows the mindset though of what we'd call liberal or
[03:14:01.960 --> 03:14:07.000]  communist jurisdictions did you see the case last week i know you've been on a town where the 82-year
[03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:12.040]  old vet the guy was robbing him uh taking his trailer trying to run over him two illegal aliens
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:16.120]  so he shot one of them just wounding him and then they let the illegals go you know they
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:21.320]  plugged guilty to stealing it and they charged him with murder not manslaughter the old man with
[03:14:21.320 --> 03:14:26.120]  with murder and life in prison uh because he defended himself that sounds like something out
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:33.080]  of london yes it does and i i know that there's that a temptation for some prosecutors even in
[03:14:33.080 --> 03:14:38.600]  a state like texas where a situation a couple of years ago the facts were a little different but
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:45.640]  the thugs were running across from his neighbor's house across his property and he blew him away
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:52.840]  and oh they spent six months trying to figure out if they could get a bill from a grand jury
[03:14:52.840 --> 03:14:59.320]  on that and they finally dropped the charges because the texas law is so clear that you can
[03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:05.000]  use lethal force if you have any reason to think your life is in danger and when you got a couple
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:12.440]  of thugs seeing you there with a shotgun cutting across your property uh and a cop actually happened
[03:15:12.440 --> 03:15:18.200]  to see it and said yeah that's what happened then you know that that's the way it ought to be and
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:24.120]  we'd reduce the criminal population a lot more quickly that way than having to endure years and
[03:15:24.120 --> 03:15:31.480]  years of appeals and trials and great cost and and injustice frankly justice delayed as justice
[03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:36.200]  denied well well larry we know in chicago and new york city they have the highest crime rates
[03:15:36.200 --> 03:15:40.040]  the criminals all move there it's a war zone every day we know that common sense but we know the
[03:15:40.040 --> 03:15:44.600]  globalist uh we know cerebrates on records saying we can't have a socialist america that we disarmed
[03:15:44.600 --> 03:15:49.400]  the american people we know for unidire at the un they say the power monopoly of the state
[03:15:49.400 --> 03:15:54.040]  everyone must be disarmed state senator obama believed in total gun bans the attorney general
[03:15:54.040 --> 03:15:59.960]  believes in it we know that that they want our guns to enslave us but the average moron who's
[03:15:59.960 --> 03:16:05.480]  scared of guns who's domesticated who was brought up by domesticated gelded people they're not really
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:10.280]  bad they're just ignorant and it's just like people who wouldn't let folks hunt wolves or coyotes or
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:15.480]  wildcats or alligators and you know places uh like major cities in florida now they're killing
[03:16:15.480 --> 03:16:20.200]  people they're killing dogs they're coming into yards now even the socialists are saying yeah
[03:16:20.200 --> 03:16:25.800]  somebody kill these alligators somebody kill these wildcats they just killed my kid you know
[03:16:25.800 --> 03:16:30.440]  kids get killed every year because they like small prey in california and now wildcats are
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:34.760]  all over la trying to eat people it's the same thing people they take the guns crime rates
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:39.720]  explode and i've seen all the statistics we're becoming a pro-gun nation again and rediscovering
[03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:46.280]  why it's so important that's gotta make these social uh globalist uh these parasites angry
[03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:52.360]  that that neither way you cut it we are shifting the momentum against them you are correct the the
[03:16:52.360 --> 03:17:00.280]  polls have been over the really the decades showing a trend in the direction of the understanding
[03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:06.920]  and wanting to apply the second amendment and this is something that is totally inconsistent
[03:17:06.920 --> 03:17:13.480]  with the socialist worldview they assume that they take charge of all uh at least important
[03:17:13.480 --> 03:17:19.640]  decisions in our lives and for them an important decision evidently is what kind of food we might
[03:17:19.640 --> 03:17:25.960]  be allowed to eat uh i don't have anything to say on behalf of junk food but if somebody wants to
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:32.280]  do that well less power to them it's okay with me it's not my job to tell somebody what to eat
[03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:38.680]  so that's the mindset of these people they are control freaks and getting back to your earlier
[03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:46.120]  point they might as you say be upset about an extra wildcat in the neighborhood but they don't
[03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:51.240]  have a problem so much with criminals because criminals don't operate within their gated
[03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:58.520]  communities they'll be safe uh almost all the time from the criminal element and so it's an
[03:17:58.520 --> 03:18:04.120]  easy price for them to pay because they don't have to pay the price the elite in england
[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:09.960]  hasn't had to pay the price of the rising crime rate following the the confiscation of virtually
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:17.400]  all the legal guns in the country and even though crime has multiplied literally multiplied the rich
[03:18:17.400 --> 03:18:22.200]  and famous uh don't ever get to see that it may be on television but it's it's never something
[03:18:22.200 --> 03:18:28.360]  that affects them directly so it's no big deal and they use our tax money to pay for government
[03:18:28.360 --> 03:18:35.000]  and private uh security larry what about the realignment uh pro-establishment republicans and
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:40.520]  democrats are losing every major primary this is a major political realignment not in parties but
[03:18:40.520 --> 03:18:46.840]  for liberty the system is panicking obama is in freefall and some of his top advisors are saying
[03:18:46.840 --> 03:18:53.240]  obama needs another oklahoma city or 9-11 that's pretty creepy to hear that what do you think obama
[03:18:53.240 --> 03:18:57.640]  and his people are going to do they're not going to give up power easily it is a worrisome thought
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:19:04.360]  and columnists are beginning to speculate that something uh like that might be in store obviously
[03:19:04.360 --> 03:19:12.200]  he brought us a financial crisis thanks to years of incredibly stupid legislation making banks give
[03:19:12.200 --> 03:19:19.160]  loans to people they knew couldn't pay them back but um it's pretty hard to get a financial crisis
[03:19:19.160 --> 03:19:26.760]  it's any worse than the one we're in so indeed the question would be what's next i think one thing
[03:19:26.760 --> 03:19:33.320]  we've seen a little foretaste is election thuggery particularly at the general election chasing away
[03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:39.560]  republican voters with uh the new black panther party well those are amazing tapes that are out
[03:19:39.560 --> 03:19:45.560]  there let's talk about arizona when we get back and and treason i mean uh obama i don't know if
[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:49.480]  you've seen the senator kyle video we could play it for you if you haven't but he you know he's
[03:19:49.480 --> 03:19:53.480]  saying he met with obama obama said i want the crisis down there i want to get a embassy pass
[03:19:53.480 --> 03:19:57.960]  i need that crisis i mean if that is an impeachable offense i don't know what is larry pratt's our
[03:19:57.960 --> 03:20:03.880]  guess stay with us making the right decisions is a challenge to investors are we going to see

[03:20:19.080 --> 03:20:24.120]  when the u.s government overextends itself and spends beyond its means many investors are turning

[03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:16.040]  i'm gonna open the phones up specifically on the headline top clinton official only a terror
[03:24:16.040 --> 03:24:21.720]  attack and save obama with the bizarre quote the bottom line here is that americans don't believe
[03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:27.240]  in president obama's leadership said Shapiro adding he has to find some way between now and
[03:24:27.240 --> 03:24:33.080]  november of demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a 9 11
[03:24:33.080 --> 03:24:38.040]  event or Oklahoma city bombing i can't think of how he could do that larry i know i brought this
[03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:41.560]  up to you but i really want to get your take on it specifically that's out of the financial
[03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:49.000]  times of london uh and the media is everywhere saying he's in freefall uh whereas he has 40
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:54.280]  percent supporting him only 13 percent total have confidence i mean this guy looks like he may be the
[03:24:54.280 --> 03:25:00.360]  most unpopular president in history he's working on it i think he may get there um and i don't
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:06.040]  think he's incompetent my take on this guy and you and i've talked about it from even before he
[03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:12.680]  was elected and i know i published a column before he was elected pointing out that he was a marxist
[03:25:12.680 --> 03:25:21.400]  thug well he true to sololinsky the rules for radicals author who explained how to tear down
[03:25:21.400 --> 03:25:27.960]  a system and have it implode on itself by just overloading it with too much welfare voter fraud
[03:25:27.960 --> 03:25:34.200]  all kinds of financial crisis you name it the guy's working very hard to destroy
[03:25:34.840 --> 03:25:39.720]  and he's working very fast at it and he's done that i mean if you're going to build the new
[03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:43.960]  socialist utopia you've got to destroy the old house that was there they want to destroy this
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:50.360]  country absolutely and uh there's just no question that that's not incompetence down in the gulf of
[03:25:50.360 --> 03:25:57.160]  mexico that is a desire to get all those blankety blank republican voters payback time baby now we'll
[03:25:57.160 --> 03:26:02.200]  teach you that you should be dependent rather than independent rather than producers you should be
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:08.840]  drones so that we can control you i agree with you uh bp uh is the top globalist company that with
[03:26:08.840 --> 03:26:15.000]  al gore and in ron created the carbon tax and ron paul agrees he thinks it's very suspicious and
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:20.040]  the way they're blocking any relief i i think they stage the whole thing well if they didn't
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:26.360]  stage it it true to rama manual you never let a good crisis go to waste but you know obama
[03:26:26.360 --> 03:26:32.520]  himself is in a crisis and we should resolve not to let that crisis go to waste and we should
[03:26:32.520 --> 03:26:37.800]  take care of business as we have been you you mentioned before we went to the break that at
[03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:42.760]  least most of the primaries have been going as we would hope they would sometimes we have too many
[03:26:42.760 --> 03:26:48.520]  conservatives dividing the vote and uh liberal gets through like dan coats in indiana but by
[03:26:48.520 --> 03:26:54.600]  and large the results have really been very satisfactory and uh if especially somebody
[03:26:54.600 --> 03:26:59.560]  like jim de ment is able to continue doing what he's doing the republican caucus in the senate
[03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:05.800]  will have shifted to the right enough to uh tell senator mcconnell to stop playing patty
[03:27:05.800 --> 03:27:10.520]  cakes with the democrats i don't know but it's certainly going to be more difficult for senator
[03:27:10.520 --> 03:27:17.000]  mcconnell because some of the people that are coming owe him nothing let's shift gears to arizona
[03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:22.200]  many have called it treason i think it fits the definition of high treason not just treason
[03:27:22.200 --> 03:27:26.520]  we now have that senator kyle testimony that he was told they will they love the crisis the
[03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:32.840]  kidnappings the murder of the death uh 80 plus miles denied to citizens into the state uh and
[03:27:32.840 --> 03:27:37.400]  that uh they are going to sue they're going to file multiple lawsuits against arizona but all
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:41.800]  these other states are going to do the same thing arizona has done uh the democrats are now in the
[03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:47.560]  wall street journal begging obama to back off they say this has unified the population really
[03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:53.640]  illustrated that these people want to destroy this country maybe they don't remember the intensity
[03:27:54.600 --> 03:27:59.960]  almost literally the green smoke coming up from the capitol hill switchboards during the amnesty
[03:27:59.960 --> 03:28:06.840]  fight that really got the country angry and there was there were groups out there uh encouraging
[03:28:06.840 --> 03:28:12.440]  people to make calls but there was also just a lot of spontaneous effort because people couldn't
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:18.920]  believe that we're going to allow not only to continue such law-breaking as just walk into our
[03:28:18.920 --> 03:28:26.600]  country la di da and then this have no regard for the danger it puts people in uh the rancher uh
[03:28:26.600 --> 03:28:31.560]  just a what two three months of four months ago that was murdered on his own land down on the border
[03:28:32.200 --> 03:28:40.920]  and this was a guy known to have helped illegals uh that were in danger of dying of thirst and yet
[03:28:41.480 --> 03:28:46.040]  no good deed goes unpunished and that doesn't seem to bother obama because again he lives in a gated
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:52.120]  community it's called the white house and you can't get close to him for anything so he's no
[03:28:52.120 --> 03:28:56.280]  problem there what what what border problem we know they've been in a race they know mexico and the
[03:28:56.280 --> 03:29:00.840]  state department admit has been collapsing for four years it's now officially a failed state
[03:29:00.840 --> 03:29:05.800]  they had to merge us with mexico and the spp before it collapsed now they're behind schedule and
[03:29:05.800 --> 03:29:11.480]  they're saying get rid of the border legalize everybody as mexico collapses well the audacity
[03:29:11.480 --> 03:29:16.520]  of saying well we'll build the wall as soon as you agree to amnesty well isn't that kind of like
[03:29:16.520 --> 03:29:23.240]  closing the door after the barns the barn door after the horse got out please well that's like
[03:29:23.240 --> 03:29:29.000]  plugging a hole in the bottom of a ship after it's on the bottom yeah exactly right they think

[03:33:28.840 --> 03:33:38.040]  basically what's going on the globalists get you dependent then they hold you hostage 1-800-259-9231
[03:33:38.040 --> 03:33:43.080]  that's the subject i want to hear from you on and obama's advisors saying we need a terror attack
[03:33:43.080 --> 03:33:48.920]  so he can play the part of our big daddy and we can all worship this creature we know hitler
[03:33:48.920 --> 03:33:54.440]  stage terror attacks we know uh that stalin did it we know they use crises they don't like to
[03:33:54.440 --> 03:34:01.800]  let a good crisis go to waste 800-259-9231 finishing up a larry pratt larry again the pendulum
[03:34:01.800 --> 03:34:07.240]  starting to swing but the globalists are so well entrenched people better intensify their actions
[03:34:07.240 --> 03:34:11.960]  i want to get your view on that and give us just a quick state of the second amendment
[03:34:11.960 --> 03:34:17.960]  here in the republic and some of the battles we're fighting okay well the first one is
[03:34:17.960 --> 03:34:28.600]  uh elena kagan it is not the most likely battled that we might win but we have a chance to beat her
[03:34:29.240 --> 03:34:35.880]  it is possible that we either can get enough backbone in the republicans to launch a filibuster
[03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:41.560]  they would have the votes to kill it right there but it's also possible this woman has committed
[03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:48.840]  perjury on two occasions when she was testifying under oath she said she would uh proceed according
[03:34:48.840 --> 03:34:53.560]  to a certain course of action and she absolutely reversed course once she was in i hope folks would
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:35:00.040]  go to gun owners dot org we've got alerts there that deal with this telling the senators you better
[03:35:00.040 --> 03:35:05.960]  not even go for this gal she's an enemy of freedom and we're going to be hitting them hopefully uh
[03:35:05.960 --> 03:35:12.200]  very soon with some information on her the the actual lies that we've caught her in and i think on
[03:35:12.200 --> 03:35:17.240]  two occasions we can actually make the case that she committed their voting for confirmation next
[03:35:17.240 --> 03:35:23.000]  week on the 20th i guess that's uh that's what it's scheduled yes that's tuesday so and i know
[03:35:23.000 --> 03:35:28.520]  you've done the research but can you give us a little idea of what the particular uh perjury
[03:35:28.520 --> 03:35:34.600]  is one just give you one for example uh she was testifying when under oath when she was up for
[03:35:34.600 --> 03:35:40.520]  solicitor general her present job she was asked if she were going to pursue anything against doma
[03:35:40.520 --> 03:35:45.080]  defensive marriage act and she said no i'm not interested in going there almost the first thing
[03:35:45.080 --> 03:35:50.840]  she did when she got in was to turn around and start whacking away in the courts on that issue
[03:35:50.840 --> 03:35:59.560]  so it seems to me that she's got herself uh in pretty deep and she didn't subject herself well
[03:35:59.560 --> 03:36:05.960]  to the light of day so i'm hopeful that we're going to push back hard enough that some of these
[03:36:05.960 --> 03:36:12.600]  guys are going to maybe this is going to be uh obama's harriet mires the hapless nominee that
[03:36:12.600 --> 03:36:18.840]  bush put forward that was finally slapped down another thing that's going in and could be very
[03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:24.760]  encouraging for the elections and it would re-energize discussion of socialized medicine which the
[03:36:24.760 --> 03:36:30.440]  republicans have not apparently wanted to do and that's that's not a good thing uh there's
[03:36:30.440 --> 03:36:37.400]  a discharge petition on uh representative steve king's uh measure that would just flat out repeal
[03:36:37.400 --> 03:36:43.480]  obama care now it's not likely uh and obama's going to sign it but we need to get the members of
[03:36:43.480 --> 03:36:49.480]  congress on record and whether they even get to a vote the fact is that uh while we work to the
[03:36:49.480 --> 03:36:56.840]  majority that must sign to force the vote that signing list itself will be like a recorded vote
[03:36:56.840 --> 03:37:01.720]  and one more thing that we can hold over them you mean after all the things that came out after
[03:37:01.720 --> 03:37:07.480]  the passage of the bill about what a corrupt and rotten piece of socialism it is you still
[03:37:07.480 --> 03:37:14.040]  wouldn't vote against it that so i think that's a uh a pretty powerful issue and secondly i hope
[03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:21.480]  people will uh kind of keep an eye on our colleagues at the nra redstate.com a very widely read blog
[03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:29.880]  yesterday had a column by eric erickson on how the nra actually tried to stop senator coburn's
[03:37:29.880 --> 03:37:37.480]  measure from succeeding happily he uh withstood their efforts and it is now law that the reagan
[03:37:37.480 --> 03:37:44.920]  era gun ban of guns in national parks has been overturned but they didn't want it to go false
[03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:49.880]  well what about the wall street journal a month ago ran the headline uh that the nra sided with
[03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:56.200]  the house that's passed the bill to restrict uh political speech about how congressmen have voted
[03:37:56.200 --> 03:38:03.000]  that had people's jaw dropping here in washington and they're still taking heat for it and actually
[03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:08.040]  we may bottle that up in the senate that's another thing folks can go to gun owners dot org for we've
[03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:13.720]  got a another alert that deals with that i forget the name of that bill what's it called disclose
[03:38:13.720 --> 03:38:20.680]  it's an acronym for something about the light of day on disclosure in politics it's just a way of
[03:38:20.680 --> 03:38:27.320]  harassing members of organizations of an attempt to get the name there now the the federal elections
[03:38:27.320 --> 03:38:31.960]  commission had ron paul on a week and a half ago they're now investigating camman for liberty with
[03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:37.640]  a fine tooth comb uh saying telling him you're not allowed to send out emails on how people voted i
[03:38:37.640 --> 03:38:43.480]  mean that's incredible we can't say how somebody voted what what they're they're mad because he had
[03:38:44.680 --> 03:38:50.680]  a way of starting up an organization from his presidential drive and campaign for liberty
[03:38:50.680 --> 03:38:57.000]  is going great guns and that has them very upset it's a new kid on the block and i guess they'd like
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:02.760]  to strangle it in its crib but that ain't gonna happen as you know it's a key catalyst to get more
[03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:08.520]  patriot uh you know pro-constitution candidates in when every time they run they win if they've
[03:39:08.520 --> 03:39:15.720]  got backing absolutely it's been a very successful year for uh that segment of the political spectrum
[03:39:15.720 --> 03:39:21.720]  they've been doing an excellent job the tea party is reflective of that work as well and it's brought
[03:39:21.720 --> 03:39:28.120]  in additional people and the fact that there are lots of new people involved tells you something
[03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:34.360]  when when in a very liberal district uh out in california representative harman uh brad sherman
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:42.600]  when the people at a town hall meeting uh erupted in disbelief and cat calls when he said he wasn't
[03:39:42.600 --> 03:39:49.640]  aware of the thuggery of the new black panther party uh during the elections up in philadelphia in 2008
[03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:55.640]  uh the people just shut the meeting down uh and the guy said well i didn't see anything about it in
[03:39:55.640 --> 03:40:02.040]  the media that i read well that's just the problem pal you're in your own dream world and the rest of
[03:40:02.040 --> 03:40:07.720]  us aren't in that socialist cocoon well that's right less and less people watch it cnn ms nbc
[03:40:07.720 --> 03:40:14.360]  are in freefall and i'm not exaggerating i'm not one of the you know even top well some ways you
[03:40:14.360 --> 03:40:20.440]  look at number one internet show top 15 conservatively a talk radio but still that's not that you know
[03:40:20.440 --> 03:40:26.520]  big for being on stations but the issue is i can look at our affiliated stations and just the
[03:40:26.520 --> 03:40:31.960]  stations that subscribe to arbitra on our numbers i have more listeners and viewers
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:38.680]  conservatively in my three hours than cnn's top rated show there's still the prestige of larry
[03:40:38.680 --> 03:40:46.200]  king having a million viewers but i mean i have close to 300 000 podcast listeners a day our affiliates
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:52.280]  now have over 400 000 listeners for every 15 minutes uh that's the big uh you know cum number uh
[03:40:52.280 --> 03:40:57.800]  that the ad agencies have uh and i mean i mean if i've got over a million people every day more
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:01.240]  than two million total a week because you know you have regulars that come in but the straggler
[03:41:01.240 --> 03:41:05.640]  which is about two million a week and growing i mean larry king live is a joke i mean that's why
[03:41:05.640 --> 03:41:10.680]  he's retiring i mean it's over for these people no one is listening to them correct their their
[03:41:10.680 --> 03:41:16.200]  numbers are in freefall uh every time i see something about that it's clear that people
[03:41:16.200 --> 03:41:21.000]  are either not getting any information at all but more likely they're going to all of these
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:25.880]  alternate sources that are available i don't get a daily paper delivered to my house anymore
[03:41:25.880 --> 03:41:33.240]  why should i you have so many ways of getting information and the information that i'm looking
[03:41:33.240 --> 03:41:36.920]  for wouldn't have been in the daily well that brings me to my next to last question here the
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:42.760]  two questions quickly uh because i know you're busy uh number one chicago how do you analyze
[03:41:42.760 --> 03:41:46.840]  that ruling and the and the hoops uh that chicago want people to jump through do you think that'll
[03:41:46.840 --> 03:41:51.640]  be challenged uh you know quick statement on that sir and then finally they're openly announcing
[03:41:51.640 --> 03:41:56.200]  they want to censor the web and talk radio now that's just proving to people what thugs they are
[03:41:56.200 --> 03:42:00.840]  exactly well i think in case of chicago they're going to get away with this until they are
[03:42:00.840 --> 03:42:06.360]  challenged and there's the possibility that if the uh second heller case which is now before
[03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:13.560]  the dc court of appeals is successful and if it's lawyered in the proper way so that it's a broad
[03:42:13.560 --> 03:42:19.960]  enough uh suit and a broad enough decision it would not only bring down the dc licensing law
[03:42:19.960 --> 03:42:26.360]  which i think is is quite likely based on what judge scalia said in the first heller decision
[03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:31.960]  uh but it could then if it's uh a broad enough instead of uh just a narrow thing like these
[03:42:31.960 --> 03:42:38.920]  first two heller and mcdonald decisions have been it could bring down chicago as well um i'm
[03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:44.680]  sorry the the second point that you uh wanted addressed i know just finally the open announcements
[03:42:44.680 --> 03:42:50.360]  that they want to tax or control the internet i i think that you're correct that has shown people
[03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:54.520]  that uh if they can't win the argument they're going to try to put a gag in her mouth that's
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:43:00.600]  what mccain feingold was all about that's what the disclose act is all about and if they can come up
[03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:05.560]  with this and they're already starting in a few markets to set up these soviets they call them
[03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:14.280]  stakeholder councils but the word council is soviet in russian and the these soviets would be designed
[03:43:14.280 --> 03:43:22.360]  to uh file a liberal complaint against uh uh any station that's carrying your show or any of the
[03:43:22.360 --> 03:43:31.480]  other talkers um and make it so that they have so much in a file at the time for renewal that they
[03:43:31.480 --> 03:43:37.240]  might not get their renewal so stations knowing that would then start uh figuring out well what
[03:43:37.240 --> 03:43:42.200]  kind of pablam can i offset so i don't have the expense of fighting these fights and instead of
[03:43:42.200 --> 03:43:46.520]  stations buckling to that they need to get more aggressive and defend the first amendment you
[03:43:46.520 --> 03:43:53.160]  cannot pacify uh these hooligans i mean this is real authoritarianism these people aren't playing
[03:43:53.160 --> 03:44:00.920]  games correct that is exactly the right thing to do we we need to uh make sure that uh if they want
[03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:07.720]  to do thuggery at the polls it'll be dealt with uh in a proper fashion uh we got to be organized
[03:44:07.720 --> 03:44:13.000]  for that and it goes back to the point you made earlier uh we've got to double down and intensify
[03:44:13.000 --> 03:44:19.080]  our efforts and we've all got to get involved as poll watchers and uh people that are right there
[03:44:19.080 --> 03:44:24.360]  on the scene so when stuff starts to happen you know in chicago the republican poll watchers
[03:44:24.360 --> 03:44:29.160]  usually a democrat anyway so he's not going to pick up a cell phone and call the cops uh we've
[03:44:29.160 --> 03:44:34.440]  got to be there to do those kinds of things absolutely and instead of having one video
[03:44:34.440 --> 03:44:38.360]  people intimidating voters will have hundreds as we know what's going on larry pratt thank you so

[03:44:56.040 --> 03:44:59.640]  and the fact that the police are saying we're not going to protect you that's going up on
[03:44:59.640 --> 03:45:04.680]  info wars dot com and prison planet dot com within two hours we need this video to go mega viral

[03:45:21.240 --> 03:45:25.560]  uh we shot it last night and working on it this morning uh that's going up because people need
[03:45:25.560 --> 03:45:29.240]  to put the pieces together they know something's wrong they don't know specifically what it is

[03:45:51.480 --> 03:45:56.360]  out uh you and larry absolutely correct in your assessment of the treasonous behavior uh by the
[03:45:56.360 --> 03:46:00.200]  president and other officials uh the the bottom line is they need to be held accountable by the
[03:46:00.200 --> 03:46:05.000]  people which speaks a larger point you had earlier of accelerating the freedom uh freedom movement
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:09.800]  we need to be able to reach new people uh the future of this movement the freedom movement
[03:46:09.800 --> 03:46:14.520]  depends upon the need to change the language of the debate in a way we can communicate our message
[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:19.560]  so we can reach these new people um you know the idea of of people having to get involved to promote
[03:46:19.560 --> 03:46:24.280]  and sustain freedom is new and scary it's a scary concept for a lot of people most people just used
[03:46:24.280 --> 03:46:28.840]  to sitting on their butts and not doing anything and now you know the the proposed with getting
[03:46:28.840 --> 03:46:33.400]  up and doing something and fighting for your belief in freedom is a scary concept which
[03:46:33.400 --> 03:46:39.000]  paralyzes a lot of people well here's an analogy if you went to yellowstone park now in the rural
[03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:45.240]  areas uh the uninhabited areas so the more remote areas where they've introduced hundreds of vicious
[03:46:45.240 --> 03:46:50.280]  timber wolves and you went out and poured pig blood all over yourself and tied yourself down
[03:46:50.280 --> 03:46:54.520]  they would come and eat you and it's the same thing with tyrants if we just sit there watching
[03:46:54.520 --> 03:46:59.480]  our tv sets and sucking our thumbs and doing nothing and not being involved we will be overrun we
[03:46:59.480 --> 03:47:05.640]  will be oppressed there is no uh you know option here and i appreciate your call matt uh marry in

[03:47:26.760 --> 03:47:35.160]  and try to get that stock the toll roads are going to be used to finance the trans texas corridor
[03:47:35.160 --> 03:47:43.160]  the trans texas corridor is just a corridor that goes up from from china if you can imagine this

[03:48:10.440 --> 03:48:14.520]  wanted to hear from you on that's why we open the phones up is i want to hear from you about
[03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:18.760]  obama's advisors saying they need a stage terror attack and the police saying they're not going
[03:48:18.760 --> 03:48:22.840]  to protect you they're going to let society totally collapse now larry pratt agreed that's
[03:48:22.840 --> 03:48:27.640]  the scenario and i want to hear from you mary i want your perspective what do you think about
[03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:34.120]  those issues let me try to let me try to explain this to you these the big trans texas corridor
[03:48:34.120 --> 03:48:40.120]  is being built to carry big heavy army equipment what do you think of that and when they have
[03:48:40.120 --> 03:48:45.560]  the toll roads they're going to shut those roads down and when they want well you know they built
[03:48:45.560 --> 03:48:50.120]  that i'm mary i know all about the toll roads yes i made a film about it it's called in game
[03:48:50.120 --> 03:48:54.600]  that's a large part of the three hour film and yes i know they built the the highway system for
[03:48:54.600 --> 03:49:00.280]  the military the eisenhower administration started it uh and and so they can land large jets on it
[03:49:00.280 --> 03:49:04.680]  and and yes we don't need a big road into mexico uh mary i guess another day when we're on that
[03:49:04.680 --> 03:49:10.200]  subject that's fine uh jason in california you care about the issues i raised hello alex thanks
[03:49:10.200 --> 03:49:17.320]  for having me on yes sir go ahead so about a month ago i was on my way home um i went out and had
[03:49:17.320 --> 03:49:23.160]  a drink with a friend of mine and i wasn't drunk or anything really i had just a couple beers um
[03:49:23.160 --> 03:49:28.440]  and on my way home on the highway the 101 north up here in northern california uh i was attacked
[03:49:28.440 --> 03:49:33.400]  by a hitchhiker and uh so i called 911 i mean it's kind of like you're on for a hitchhiker
[03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:39.000]  i didn't stop uh he stepped in the path of the uh bike lane forcing me to veer into the uh mill
[03:49:39.000 --> 03:49:43.160]  of highway how they do that and uh so i called because in good conscience i couldn't pretty
[03:49:43.160 --> 03:49:47.720]  much just let this crazy guy just stand aside the freeway who is no that's the message that's the
[03:49:47.720 --> 03:49:51.480]  message and that's the point i wanted to make today when you call the cops especially in these
[03:49:51.480 --> 03:49:56.040]  corrupt cities they end up taking you to jail they don't want you calling them yeah and that's
[03:49:56.040 --> 03:50:00.760]  exactly what happened um i was pretty much are incarcerated temporarily five days deprived of
[03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:05.080]  freedom because they said i concealed weapon it was a sheath knife clearly hanging on my right side
[03:50:05.080 --> 03:50:08.840]  uh the officer pretty much turned around and i'm sure the uh crazy hitchhiker got scared away
[03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:13.480]  by the lights pretty much and uh so this little tyrant pretty much uh flipped out one time so
[03:50:13.480 --> 03:50:18.200]  let's be clear you're on a bicycle you got a knife to protect yourself california is collapsing like
[03:50:18.200 --> 03:50:22.440]  mexico it's going the exact same direction and you went to jail for having a knife and he claimed
[03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:25.880]  you couldn't drink a couple beers and ride your bicycle yeah he spins around behind me throws me
[03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:29.800]  up into a street sign and then puts me on the on the hood of his cruiser has his partner show up
[03:50:29.800 --> 03:50:33.480]  points a taser in my head whole time calling them by their names and i'm like look what's going on
[03:50:33.480 --> 03:50:36.120]  what are you going to do about the guy that attacked me why are you doing this they don't
[03:50:36.120 --> 03:50:40.360]  answer anything uh pretty much panically restrict my belt off drag me off and hold me for like
[03:50:40.360 --> 03:50:44.840]  25 000 ransom well yeah i know you know you i mean i'm not saying the i'm what they did was wrong
[03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:49.160]  but a lot of times they get confused they hear there's a hitchhiker they probably thought you

[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:29.000]  during bush his ratings would fall they would stage something all we caught a terrorist here
[03:57:29.000 --> 03:57:33.000]  or we caught a terrorist there then his ratings would go back up and it was like a seesaw the
[03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:37.480]  whole entire and ridge came out in his book last year they had a homelands curtain said they were
[03:57:37.480 --> 03:57:44.360]  staging that and the terror alerts were fake what an incredible admission exactly and it
[03:57:44.360 --> 03:57:51.160]  and the sick thing is is like you say they openly admit this garbage it's it's absolutely
[03:57:51.160 --> 03:57:58.200]  sick it's sadistic it's satanic it's evil i can't even describe it in in the true terms but uh
[03:57:59.160 --> 03:58:03.960]  eric holder even said that within terms of that police thing that you were talking about in oakland
[03:58:03.960 --> 03:58:09.320]  that uh they will not stop black people from attacking white people committing crimes well
[03:58:09.320 --> 03:58:14.120]  it's just total total implosion it's like this billboard saying national socialist communist
[03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:20.360]  socialist uh marxist socials democrat socialist we know what this change is but obama will go
