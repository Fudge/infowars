[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:41.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones my friends we have
[00:41.240 --> 00:50.840]  another giant plate full of key information to cover on this September 5th 2012 Wednesday
[00:50.840 --> 00:57.120]  edition we're going to be here for the next three hours coming up Dr. Richard Stallman one
[00:57.120 --> 01:02.920]  of the main inventors of open-free software GNU and others he'll be joining us to talk
[01:02.920 --> 01:07.400]  about all the Trojan horses built into the entire infrastructure that he's been warning
[01:07.400 --> 01:15.200]  of for more than two decades turning our entire planet into a DARPA run control grid Chris
[01:15.200 --> 01:19.760]  Hedges the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist writer for the New York Times other major
[01:19.760 --> 01:26.080]  publications who has been somewhat successfully suing the federal government over the NDAA
[01:26.080 --> 01:30.360]  will be joining us for 30 minutes as well to start the next hour and this is going to
[01:30.360 --> 01:36.520]  be a big broadcast lined up today especially when we've got cases of people now being
[01:36.520 --> 01:44.880]  arrested at airports and on the streets at the DNC because they're protesting peacefully
[01:44.880 --> 01:50.720]  and the Department of Defense is over it they're calling it low-level terrorism and likening
[01:50.720 --> 01:56.120]  it to bombing the Pentagon to protest and they ask the judges hold them in jail they
[01:56.120 --> 02:03.240]  plan to protest which is terrorism because our policy says it is so now being on the
[02:03.240 --> 02:09.680]  watch list which no judge jury puts you on you just get arrested so the NDAA is being
[02:09.680 --> 02:14.640]  implemented and it's just happening like it's no big deal also I mentioned this briefly
[02:14.640 --> 02:20.680]  yesterday but I only mentioned one small area of it that it's usually government that's
[02:20.680 --> 02:28.800]  leaking data on purpose but hackers embarrass Apple with data leak and this is tens of millions
[02:28.800 --> 02:38.360]  twelve million plus Apple passcodes Apple ID so they can get into everything with that
[02:38.360 --> 02:45.760]  basically and so if you have an Apple ID you need to change it right now but the point
[02:45.760 --> 02:49.240]  is by the way I have Apple devices they haven't been telling me sending me messages saying
[02:49.240 --> 02:55.520]  change my passcode so there you go because they're complicit and it just shows the chronic
[02:55.520 --> 03:00.960]  ignorance of the media because most of these aren't even operatives they're just pulled
[03:00.960 --> 03:06.720]  from generations of dumbed down compartmentalized people that in the Telecommunications Act
[03:06.720 --> 03:16.360]  of 96 of 2001 and in other major pieces of legislation it funds and mandates backdoors
[03:16.360 --> 03:23.800]  in everything all smartphones all cell phones all computers all washers and dryers alarm
[03:23.800 --> 03:36.720]  clocks AM FM radio VHF UHF cable systems satellites IP companies with more than Internet
[03:36.720 --> 03:43.320]  companies with more than a hundred customers it's all in there the hubs are built in as
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.840]  I said the phone companies are the NSA I told you that in 1996 because I read the Stink
[03:47.840 --> 03:53.000]  and Telecommunications Act which engineers I was only on the radio in Austin then contacted
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.680]  me and came to the radio station said read this it's the Telecommunications Act I went
[03:57.680 --> 04:01.880]  and checked and they said I can't tell you what's going on but the phone company is the
[04:01.880 --> 04:07.120]  NSA I had whistleblowers just like five years ago the guy in San Francisco came out and
[04:07.120 --> 04:14.680]  said they've got whole rooms whole floors I mean we broke this in 96 not because I'm
[04:14.680 --> 04:21.080]  special I had a radio show they knew I'd put it on they brought it to me I had a time
[04:21.080 --> 04:27.600]  warner engineer contact me and go the new digital scientific Atlantic systems have a microphone
[04:27.600 --> 04:32.800]  the computers are listening to you with keyword later it came out I had the same engineers
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.880]  say these on-stars are being listened to we can see how many there how many times they're
[04:36.880 --> 04:41.400]  being accessed they're being accessed millions of times a week they're listening in live
[04:41.400 --> 04:49.400]  time later came out in the news now they kill these people when they try to get info out
[04:49.400 --> 04:55.520]  I mean we're deep into this it's all totally illegal but the FBI playing on ignorance
[04:55.520 --> 05:03.320]  says we're not we didn't have your code Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the black

[05:08.040 --> 05:11.360]  been going on in this country I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just
[05:11.360 --> 05:16.200]  how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream news every day millions of people have lost

[09:07.560 --> 09:13.880]  shifted from al-qaeda being the reason they're abolishing the bill of rights and constitution
[09:13.880 --> 09:21.160]  over to domestic groups that do not support the new world order and openly saying if you
[09:21.160 --> 09:27.560]  don't accept foreign banks quote occupying the u.s. and quote making us slaves of international
[09:27.560 --> 09:32.320]  banks then you're a terrorist so they've pretty much gone from denying all this exist saying
[09:32.320 --> 09:37.480]  if you don't accept it you're the terrorist which is what you'd expect by a foreign corporate
[09:37.480 --> 09:44.240]  takeover of your government and now here we are they're trying to shut the move towards
[09:44.240 --> 09:51.880]  shutting down freedom on the web and a lot more okay also dr. richard stallman dealing
[09:51.880 --> 09:57.680]  with all the different backdoor systems built into your cell phones built into your smart
[09:57.680 --> 10:03.720]  meters built into your washers and dryers everything tracking you the fbi caught as
[10:03.720 --> 10:10.760]  usual one agent with the passcodes to 12 million people's computers i mean that's how they
[10:10.760 --> 10:16.640]  operate google i told you a decade ago when they first launched those google cars or about
[10:16.640 --> 10:22.280]  nine years ago to be technical was driving around for the nsa hacking your computer and
[10:22.280 --> 10:26.760]  stealing your data because it's not really hacking because they have the access master
[10:26.760 --> 10:33.520]  codes already hard built into all the major computers they mandate if a chinese south
[10:33.520 --> 10:41.200]  korean singaporean indian ships are to be sold in the west in agreements they have to
[10:41.200 --> 10:48.080]  have backdoors built into them so that governments and corporations can instantly access your
[10:48.080 --> 10:53.640]  computer and track you watch you listen to you in live time this is in all the patents
[10:53.640 --> 10:58.600]  google seven years ago put out press releases to its shareholders admitting they're watching
[10:58.600 --> 11:03.200]  you and your own they're listening to every word you say they are the nsa oh it's so fun
[11:03.200 --> 11:07.440]  you're such an idiot but then when you complain about it they say oh conspiracy theory even
[11:07.440 --> 11:12.360]  though it's an oppress release so that's how they operate and then when people finally
[11:12.360 --> 11:16.840]  start going hey there's backdoor tech built into all the chips they go yes the communists
[11:16.840 --> 11:23.320]  chinese they did it they're they're they've got backdoors and all of our defense tech
[11:23.320 --> 11:29.600]  and they're they're hacking in and in and in missile systems are failing and the phalanx
[11:29.600 --> 11:34.600]  gun system is failing on board the destroyers it's it's those dirty commies that the bankers
[11:34.600 --> 11:39.000]  set up in power at forty nine putting mouse a tongue in the Rockefellers bragged in the
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.160]  new york times nineteen seventy seven i have copies of it in game blueprint for global
[11:43.160 --> 11:48.680]  enslavement went to the ut law library pulled up the new york times right there praising
[11:48.680 --> 11:54.920]  how they put the commies in and pay to ship all our jobs and have tax incentives to move
[11:54.920 --> 11:59.640]  or pay to move entire factories over there with your tax money but then say give your
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.360]  rights up the coming chinese are going to get you gotta love that or if you're against
[12:04.360 --> 12:10.160]  endless wars in the new world order oh you must be pro china see that's a little mind
[12:10.160 --> 12:16.480]  games they play you see the globalists are neocolonialist but they're not just colonizing
[12:16.480 --> 12:23.520]  the third world they're now deindustrializing in a takeover mood move the first world that's
[12:23.520 --> 12:28.640]  their that's their real program and then they have a bunch of low level acolyte quote communist
[12:28.640 --> 12:34.720]  socialist liberals who are anti-western who believe they're destroying the west to build
[12:34.720 --> 12:40.400]  up the third world but really in actuality it's destroying the third world and the wealthy
[12:40.400 --> 12:46.560]  west which has come out in the Copenhagen climate change treaties global tax treaties
[12:46.560 --> 12:53.440]  where they admit it's for world government i mean it's just all there it is a neo feudalistic
[12:53.440 --> 13:01.360]  anti-industrialization program being carried out against the population of the world but
[13:01.360 --> 13:08.760]  the neo cons will tell you in movies like 2016 obama's america that oh he's just anti-american
[13:08.760 --> 13:12.480]  and so that's why he's paying to shut down our jobs and paying to shut down our power
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.360]  plants and doing all of this well mit romney support shutting down the power plants mit
[13:17.360 --> 13:22.440]  romney has the exact same policies in actuality because he's run by the same interest why is
[13:22.440 --> 13:28.640]  obama putting power by goldman sacks jp morgan chase why didn't the republicans tell you
[13:28.640 --> 13:33.600]  about that no they want you to think he's a communist who wants to destroy america no
[13:33.600 --> 13:40.640]  no no he's a globalist minion leading a crew of communists who are too stupid to understand
[13:40.640 --> 13:46.040]  the real program you know they do this in most theorem in the last hundred and twenty
[13:46.040 --> 13:51.160]  years or so they shifted from wide spectrum research to a dogmatic teaching system and
[13:51.160 --> 13:57.960]  in universities of competing theories that well nature is what makes you the man you
[13:57.960 --> 14:05.080]  are the woman you are no it's nurture well no it's both nature and nurture or they come
[14:05.080 --> 14:12.200]  out with theorems on does environment cause illness the amount of food you're getting
[14:12.200 --> 14:18.760]  malnutrition that was the you know the dominant theory till about 1900 that it's that that's
[14:18.760 --> 14:24.760]  what allows germs to make you sick and they said no no no it's it's it's the germ itself
[14:24.760 --> 14:31.000]  and it's your genetics well it's both it's both theorems but one theory theory fell out
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.640]  one thesis fell out the other then became the orthodoxy when when you actually study
[14:37.640 --> 14:43.040]  all of these different thought processes the globalist put out there's truth in all of
[14:43.040 --> 14:48.760]  them and the globalists have higher level specialized schools where they unify the fields
[14:48.760 --> 14:55.120]  and say here's how you really think they have special economic schools above the Chicago
[14:55.120 --> 15:01.560]  business school above the Chicago school of economics and I've had former in my six officers
[15:01.560 --> 15:07.880]  on about this I've had top bankers on I've had top regulators on to top economists to
[15:07.880 --> 15:12.920]  break this down how you're then sent to special schools when they're ready to make you a
[15:12.920 --> 15:18.160]  vice president and they're like now here's how it really works sit down Mr. Beal that
[15:18.160 --> 15:24.800]  can we queue up the network Howard Beal speech not the one where he's mad as Hades and I'm
[15:24.800 --> 15:31.480]  gonna take anymore the one where Howard Beal goes to visit the head of the company and
[15:31.480 --> 15:35.080]  he says sit down Mr. Beal there are no more nations there are no more countries there
[15:35.080 --> 15:40.960]  are no more cultures there's only corporations and each of you is a has a piece of stock
[15:40.960 --> 15:46.080]  we'll know what he's really saying is each of you is a piece of stock a human resource
[15:46.080 --> 15:54.440]  and humanity is seen as cheap humanity is seen as trash to be carried away the new world
[15:54.440 --> 15:59.520]  order is teaching us that we're scum teaching us we're ugly teaching us we're bad teaching
[15:59.520 --> 16:06.720]  us we're not fulfilled preparing us with a racial memory to accept what they will call
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.040]  the end of the world they have all the fake religions teaching it they have the New Agers
[16:11.040 --> 16:18.280]  teaching it but the end of the world's coming and so lay down and die it is a kill switch
[16:18.280 --> 16:25.560]  built into our psyche to give up and they're teaching you that you are to be aborted they
[16:25.560 --> 16:31.640]  don't just want to abort 50 million babies in America 52 million the last 39 years they
[16:31.640 --> 16:38.760]  want to get you ready to abort the natural development of humanity to satisfy the crazed
[16:38.760 --> 16:47.200]  ego of 180 IQ globalist who still are missing the deeper empathy and understanding and who
[16:47.200 --> 16:51.920]  are so power mad they know they're getting blowback from what they're doing opening
[16:51.920 --> 16:56.880]  the Pandora's box opening the Ark of the Covenant and all that's shooting out of it
[16:56.880 --> 17:03.520]  at them but they cannot help it they are like mobs to flame and yes they're on fire with
[17:03.520 --> 17:10.640]  incredible intellects but they're missing spiritual intelligence spiritual discernments they are
[17:10.640 --> 17:18.560]  not spiritually smart and because of that they may actually create the end of the world
[17:18.560 --> 17:24.760]  scenario that they use to make everybody stand down so we do face the end of the world if
[17:24.760 --> 17:31.640]  we don't wake up and take action and again even if you believe it's the end of the world
[17:31.640 --> 17:38.560]  next week the end of the world as we know it the idea of turning loose of your destiny
[17:38.560 --> 17:44.880]  and just saying it's all over because somebody told you it was into the world is giving up
[17:44.880 --> 17:49.160]  on your destiny to live to the fullest and so that's why they don't want you to think
[17:49.160 --> 17:53.400]  you have a spirit or a soul because if you don't well then you won't care if it's the
[17:53.400 --> 17:57.840]  end of the world you'll just selfishly go out and cheat other people and and and abuse
[17:57.840 --> 18:04.280]  yourself and never develop to a higher level but if you understand that there are things
[18:04.280 --> 18:11.680]  that transcend these earth suits if you understand that innately from your own experience and
[18:11.680 --> 18:16.240]  the flow of time there is no past there is no present there is no future there is the
[18:16.240 --> 18:21.840]  flow of time what happened a trillion years ago happened and is happening and is flowing
[18:21.840 --> 18:28.240]  forward now you understand that I didn't read that the book I inherently know that and the
[18:28.240 --> 18:33.000]  controllers know that and so they can teach you that nothing matters well you'll just
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.840]  turn loose of the reins you'll turn loose of the wheel you'll turn loose of the rudder
[18:36.840 --> 18:41.560]  you'll turn loose of the direction and just give it to these people that crave it so much
[18:41.560 --> 18:46.360]  and they'll be able to program you like a machine but the minute you realize that there's more
[18:46.360 --> 18:52.840]  than just this body the minute you realize the mystery and the magic and the power all
[18:52.840 --> 18:57.960]  around you the minute you tune into just how incredible you are the minute you discover
[18:57.960 --> 19:03.600]  that the minute you find that secret the minute you unlock that door the minute you open that
[19:03.600 --> 19:12.280]  door the universe lies before you a veritable stairway to heaven and they don't want you
[19:12.280 --> 19:19.120]  to ever have that they don't want you to ever have access to that they want you to calmly
[19:19.120 --> 19:25.840]  march off into the night they want you to not exist they want you to not be conscious

[25:02.680 --> 25:06.600]  let's just stop right there this is a short segment I'm going to come back to the next
[25:06.600 --> 25:12.960]  segment try to try to focus myself here and get into this we have an excellent example
[25:12.960 --> 25:19.280]  of mind control manipulation a massive PR campaign we covered one yesterday launched
[25:19.280 --> 25:23.680]  over the weekend saying that organic food was a rip off you know you need pesticide
[25:23.680 --> 25:32.520]  hormone laden GMO laden McDonald's and we countered that we've got a huge report dealing
[25:32.520 --> 25:41.600]  with the 1.4 billion bullets how do you derail unawakening to the fact that government is
[25:41.600 --> 25:47.120]  in our government and is in a huge arms race building up against us how do you do that
[25:47.120 --> 25:51.160]  same way you try to derail unawakening the drones we're going to break that down after
[25:51.160 --> 25:56.160]  the break here and get into just so much more apple you know the FBI with your passcode
[25:56.160 --> 25:59.400]  without warrants watching everything you do I mean I'm going to give you the full breakdown
[25:59.400 --> 26:08.520]  but since I mentioned the 1974 75 film network where Howard Beale the newscaster who's woken
[26:08.520 --> 26:13.960]  up to reality you know and that we're being fed a bunch of lies he wakes up he gets called
[26:13.960 --> 26:19.880]  in by the real salesman who you know is the head of this major corporations because he
[26:19.880 --> 26:26.520]  knows how to sell came up from selling selling machines or whatever he tells him and in this
[26:26.520 --> 26:31.640]  the new order is throwing in your face the corporate line I've been given by big presidents
[26:31.640 --> 26:36.360]  and CEOs of media companies years ago when they try to turn me to the dark side about
[26:36.360 --> 26:40.440]  globalism and how it was really to help people and it was already in place and it was feudal
[26:40.440 --> 26:45.360]  resist what they don't tell you here where they're throwing it in your face because I've
[26:45.360 --> 26:50.080]  been given speeches similar to this off the record is that they want to get you into a
[26:50.080 --> 26:54.960]  global economy not to empower people but so they can start cutting off the resources
[26:54.960 --> 27:00.000]  and you have nowhere to run they don't tell you the eugenics end of this they don't tell
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.280]  you it leads to a high-tech ditch where they shoot you in the head but they shoot you in
[27:04.280 --> 27:14.000]  the head with bullets of gmo and and aspartame and fluoride and msg so here is the clip but
[27:14.000 --> 27:19.600]  I'm going to give you the rest of the story here it is you have meddled with the primal
[27:19.600 --> 27:28.440]  forces of nature Mr. Bill and I won't have it is that clear you think you've merely stopped
[27:28.440 --> 27:33.680]  a business deal that is not the case the Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this
[27:33.680 --> 27:40.600]  country and now they must put it back it is ebb and flow titled gravity it is ecological
[27:40.600 --> 27:50.600]  balance you are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples there are no nations
[27:50.600 --> 27:55.240]  there are no peoples there are no Russians there are no Arabs there are no third worlds
[27:55.240 --> 28:05.480]  there is no west there is only one holistic system of systems one vast and the main interwoven
[28:05.480 --> 28:13.880]  interacting multivariate multinational dominion of dollars petrodollars electrodollars multidollars
[28:13.880 --> 28:24.000]  rankmarks rings rubles pounds and shekels it is the international system of currency
[28:24.000 --> 28:33.440]  which determines the totality of life on this planet that is the natural order of things
[28:33.440 --> 28:48.600]  today that is the atomic and sub-atomic and galactic structure of things today and you
[28:48.600 --> 29:01.880]  have meddled with the primal forces of nature and you will atone am I getting through to
[29:01.880 --> 29:17.880]  you Mr. Bill you get up on your little 21 inch screen and howl about America and democracy
[29:17.880 --> 29:28.880]  there is no America there is no democracy there is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont
[29:28.880 --> 29:36.520]  and it goes on to say and each of you gets a piece of stock no you are seen as a stock
[29:36.520 --> 29:42.240]  a human resource that is traded and they are using their control over the fiat currency
[29:42.240 --> 29:48.480]  to unfairly consolidate control and play god that is the rest of the story he didn't tell
[29:48.480 --> 30:00.560]  deal where on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[38:14.320 --> 38:19.560]  island and try to find some pygmy king and and and and and bow down to somebody in Newt
[38:19.560 --> 38:25.360]  Jenny who's you know eating his neighbors because he's got big plumes of the of the
[38:25.360 --> 38:31.400]  paradise bird in his head and nobody else is allowed to wear those so we just fall down

[38:56.000 --> 39:07.000]  the stupidity thank you for all that flows out of your hell pit a humanity is just kicking

[39:29.760 --> 39:48.880]  being alive alive alive yes more I want to be alive and that concludes the rant portion
[39:48.880 --> 39:55.760]  of this transmission I need to go ahead and get into the news but I'm here ranting because
[39:55.760 --> 40:00.320]  this is how I feel I've tried intellectual debates I've shown you the facts everything
[40:00.320 --> 40:04.840]  and and and all I know is I all I can do is show you your own humanity that's in me show
[40:04.840 --> 40:10.400]  you the fires of liberty show you what built the Panama Canal what built the plane at Kitty
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.000]  Hawk what built the Saturn rockets what what what created the music of Beethoven who would
[40:15.000 --> 40:20.640]  run around craze in a studio just like I am right now this is what creates civilization
[40:20.640 --> 40:32.480]  this is what humanity is this is who we are all right refined your humanity refined your
[40:32.480 --> 40:42.520]  resistance you are under attack ahead of Chris edges joining us and Dr. Richard Stallman
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.720]  I need to settle down and cover the news here I just hate seeing my people slaughtered I
[40:47.720 --> 40:53.240]  hate seeing you hurt I hate seeing you dumb down I hate the crime of shuttering your intellect
[40:53.240 --> 40:58.400]  I hate it I hate it I hate it I want you to succeed I want you to have everything I want
[40:58.400 --> 41:03.680]  you to be successful I want to be successful and I am one with humanity you are one with
[41:03.680 --> 41:11.800]  humanity and I want all of us to live in our progeny to have a future I want to see spacecraft
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.840]  launch with colonies to go to those nearest stars we're already discovering clearly habitable
[41:16.840 --> 41:21.640]  worlds but if the globalists have their way they decided our development what they call
[41:21.640 --> 41:25.960]  our evolutionary track they say that humanity is bad that we're going to merge with machines
[41:25.960 --> 41:30.480]  they've already made that decision that should be a choice colonies that wish to merge with
[41:30.480 --> 41:37.640]  machines should go their way those of us that wish to develop and to take time need to be
[41:37.640 --> 41:44.600]  able to make our decisions not have a bunch of crazy globalist with inbred syphilitic
[41:44.600 --> 41:51.080]  design that's where all this was formed this master plan 160 years ago was in that embryonic
[41:51.080 --> 41:56.960]  fetid nursery and I say it's all a lie and I talk directly to the controllers you know
[41:56.960 --> 42:03.320]  I know your mind you know I know your deepest secrets you know you have lost your humanity
[42:03.320 --> 42:07.220]  you are cancer instead of telling us how we should kill ourselves all day and how we should
[42:07.220 --> 42:12.560]  stand down and how we should breed and how we should die I say you either grow up or
[42:12.560 --> 42:20.400]  you die you kill yourselves you kill yourselves first show us oh but no you've got the special
[42:20.400 --> 42:26.640]  humanity you want us to die so you can go forward I will tell you you will not ever
[42:26.640 --> 42:32.840]  partake of what God has in store you will never cross the river Jordan New World Order
[42:32.840 --> 42:39.400]  you will never go to the next level of humanity you are damned to hell and you know it you
[42:39.400 --> 42:58.240]  will never be part of it you will fail you failed from the beginning excuse me
[42:58.240 --> 43:05.200]  your attack on our species will be grievously visited upon you by your cells by your own
[43:05.200 --> 43:11.560]  creation your own work God will use the pits you've dug for us to destroy you all we need
[43:11.560 --> 43:19.200]  to do is testify to the truth and the fires you've built for us will consume you and I
[43:19.200 --> 43:26.440]  take no pleasure in that watching you damned from creation watching you formed in your
[43:26.440 --> 43:37.200]  mother's womb deployed into the world like a torpedo of death to attack everything good
[43:37.200 --> 43:44.040]  all right this is why I'm really feeling ladies and gentlemen when I'm up here covering
[43:44.040 --> 43:49.520]  the news this is what I'm really thinking about everything they're doing is just window
[43:49.520 --> 44:01.400]  dressing on a predetermined preplanned managed wormhole that leads us to a very bad place
[44:01.400 --> 44:07.520]  a dark vision of these crazy people that I do not wish to allow them to manifest and
[44:07.520 --> 44:12.120]  there's a fight between those of us that want goodness and those that want badness and you've
[44:12.120 --> 44:18.000]  got to choose what you want and you've got to decide what you serve but you must decide
[44:18.000 --> 44:25.080]  it now the decision is what is important and then everything else flows through it the
[44:25.080 --> 44:31.720]  floodgates will open everything flows from the spiritual decision that you're not going
[44:31.720 --> 44:37.360]  to find in these establishment churches that are government run and in these dark times
[44:37.360 --> 44:46.160]  and in the age we've now entered you must understand the truth all right let me let
[44:46.160 --> 44:51.880]  me attempt to get to the news and I have all these guests coming up it's like 65 degrees
[44:51.880 --> 45:06.720]  in here but I'm so hyped up I'm sweating all right let me just hit this not because
[45:06.720 --> 45:09.960]  we're all over the news usually when we're in the news which every day I don't even cover
[45:09.960 --> 45:17.880]  it but when it's informative I do so when it was announced 30,000 drones FAA funded
[45:17.880 --> 45:24.760]  $46 billion or 45.6 be technical memory serves this year funded to put the 30,000 drones in
[45:24.760 --> 45:28.800]  the sky and authorize it and arming them and the police announcing it Carton Emma wrote
[45:28.800 --> 45:32.960]  an article with a bunch of links to them spying on farmers with manned aircraft and drones
[45:32.960 --> 45:37.800]  in North Dakota and arrest being made with predator drones and all the rest of it and
[45:37.800 --> 45:44.520]  the Associated Press Washington Post over 500 newspapers that I saw that went and looked
[45:44.520 --> 45:48.600]  over father newspapers came with a hoax a few months ago saying there are no drones info
[45:48.600 --> 45:55.520]  wars is lying drudge drudge report comm is lying it was manned aircraft spying on people
[45:55.520 --> 45:59.800]  may just cherry picked one link in our story and just went off on that to deceive their
[45:59.800 --> 46:07.520]  readers and now I was at a Barnes and Noble like 14 years ago and saw psychology magazine
[46:07.520 --> 46:12.840]  and I opened it up and it was bragging about in the 50s British psychological warfare manuals
[46:12.840 --> 46:17.280]  until the story 10 times I'll tell it again and I already organically seen this but there
[46:17.280 --> 46:22.280]  they were admitting it that if British mercenaries for the crown killed 10,000 people in African
[46:22.280 --> 46:27.160]  country for gold or diamonds they would before the media got it they would report that 15
[46:27.160 --> 46:32.720]  have been killed and put out a fake story that the troops were killed defending themselves
[46:32.720 --> 46:39.520]  so that later when it comes out that they killed 10,000 plus it's been cold blood to
[46:39.520 --> 46:44.960]  get the area the whole villages that people would differentiate and become confused and
[46:44.960 --> 46:49.280]  make the thought process about what's true and kind of like a hacking program like a
[46:49.280 --> 46:53.320]  slow Loris attack where they just have to keep having the same request is it real is
[46:53.320 --> 46:57.920]  it real they just enter questioning into it that's why even though most troops know in
[46:57.920 --> 47:01.960]  world war one when loudspeakers are saying put up your hands you know you can go free
[47:01.960 --> 47:05.680]  and they put their hands up and get shot most troops figured it out but still some would
[47:05.680 --> 47:10.080]  panic and put their hands up in the machine gun and others would suddenly panic more
[47:10.080 --> 47:14.400]  of the machine gun oh I'm not being attacked oh shoot me see it's all psych warfare so
[47:14.400 --> 47:19.800]  there they were bragging about it and that's what this is they only have like 15 or less
[47:19.800 --> 47:25.600]  attacks they run at AP Reuters CNN and they think they're real smart because they work
[47:25.600 --> 47:29.680]  at the Ministry of Truth like Winston Smith and they get to sit there and lie to people
[47:29.680 --> 47:34.960]  and they're on the winning team oh they're really cool oh it's really cool what they
[47:34.960 --> 47:43.920]  do so watching a month ago or so starts reporting off a public purchase orders 250 million rounds
[47:43.920 --> 47:50.200]  of ammo 450 million 750 million 1.4 billion total and then hundreds of millions you know
[47:50.200 --> 47:54.240]  a future purchases they're now announcing now they quote classified even though it shouldn't
[47:54.240 --> 47:58.200]  be under federal law you know they black it out don't have an authorization to it they
[47:58.200 --> 48:01.680]  just do whatever they want now just like spying on me without warrants and so what do they
[48:01.680 --> 48:05.520]  do well about a week ago they started this but the story keeps growing they come out
[48:05.520 --> 48:15.680]  in we just go ahead and go over all this for you they come out in Detroit free press literally
[48:15.680 --> 48:19.640]  just dozens and dozens and dozens of publications the AP is in hundreds of newspapers a day with
[48:19.640 --> 48:25.920]  this social security forget conspiracy theories we bought bullets for fraud agents here's AP
[48:25.920 --> 48:31.120]  why does social security to hundred seventy four thousand bullets social security combats
[48:31.120 --> 48:39.400]  bullet rumors CNN on and on and on now what they did is they took out of I don't know
[48:39.400 --> 48:43.040]  it's just have been working 10 articles Paul Watson wrote about it Drudge report dot com
[48:43.040 --> 48:47.360]  link to others did it became big stories this was something waking people up because our
[48:47.360 --> 48:52.520]  articles had armored vehicles being purchased by the hundreds armored pillboxes by the hundreds
[48:52.520 --> 48:58.480]  military drills checkpoints 1.4 billion bullets admissions of preparing for collapse and civil
[48:58.480 --> 49:02.440]  unrest and we're like wow they're really gearing up so what do you do you go in and find a
[49:02.440 --> 49:07.400]  link to like well why is social security administration doing this well why is no doing this the weather
[49:07.400 --> 49:13.600]  service they find it and go oh and they go and say oh it was a typo a sub agency will
[49:13.600 --> 49:18.760]  still it's about the 1.4 billion or will we need this for fraud investigations the hollow
[49:18.760 --> 49:23.440]  point is for target practice which is clearly a lie you use ball ammo 99% of the time the
[49:23.440 --> 49:30.040]  point is you change the subject so like oh look at those conspiracy theorists that means
[49:30.040 --> 49:36.520]  people concerned about 1.4 plus billion bullets being bought and they said the conspiracy theorists
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.120]  said it was for civil unrest but they're delusional the articles go on and say you know these bad
[49:41.120 --> 49:45.680]  men who get upset about this the government would want to hurt you know they're just wearing
[49:45.680 --> 49:49.360]  black uniforms and got cameras and beating people everywhere we have the biggest prison
[49:49.360 --> 49:53.920]  population in the world and they're secretly arresting people now at airports on the streets
[49:53.920 --> 50:00.760]  of Charlotte for peacefully protesting people like James Tyson and the police when they
[50:00.760 --> 50:03.240]  got to the jail they said well why are you putting him in here and they go well he was
[50:03.240 --> 50:06.960]  protesting that's terrorism and they asked the judge they said well that's the terrorism
[50:06.960 --> 50:11.680]  he's on the list that's why he's in jail no reason to be in jail you're now on the list
[50:11.680 --> 50:16.240]  no guns no rights no liberty as Rahm Emanuel said we've now reached this point but we're
[50:16.240 --> 50:22.760]  not you know our articles about all that and they make it about all 174,000 bullets it
[50:22.760 --> 50:27.360]  was for the police I mean come on now they can't have bullets and they have law enforcement
[50:27.360 --> 50:32.640]  deans of colleges going these conspiracy theorists they're just out of control we need 174,000
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.320]  bullets for social security administration that's completely reasonable that's only 600
[50:36.320 --> 50:42.200]  bullets per officer per year our articles about 1.4 billion bullets but see they changed
[50:42.200 --> 50:45.920]  it with all these little old ladies getting the newspaper out and going there's that dirty
[50:45.920 --> 50:51.440]  Alex Jones and Matt Grudge again look at them worried about 1.4 billion bullets I mean
[50:51.440 --> 50:56.240]  oh but they don't tell you the 1.4 billion bullets they make it about 174,000 just like
[50:56.240 --> 51:01.440]  British Intel made it about 10 dead not 10,000 dead see

[53:03.800 --> 53:09.080]  in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble I just created a free video presentation
[53:09.080 --> 53:14.800]  at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what
[53:14.800 --> 53:19.840]  they really are incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to
[53:19.840 --> 53:25.160]  keep your power bills criminally high some have called this a conspiracy others have
[53:25.160 --> 53:30.520]  called it a coverup and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes
[53:30.520 --> 53:36.320]  my video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[53:36.320 --> 53:41.720]  and how you can beat them to watch the controversial video the thousands of other smart patriots
[53:41.720 --> 53:47.600]  have already seen in the last three months go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird
[53:47.600 --> 53:54.040]  trick to slash your power bill and protect your home go watch my video now at 123coverup.com
[53:54.040 --> 54:23.880]  before they force me to shut it down again that's 123coverup.com
[54:23.880 --> 54:37.440]  you know when I start ranting and raving on air it's real but it's not that said I could
[54:37.440 --> 54:45.920]  control myself and not do it so it's real that's how I feel but I allow myself to do
[54:45.920 --> 54:52.040]  it I let myself get a little bit out of control because it's it's it's therapy I mean I'm
[54:52.040 --> 54:56.640]  desperate I'm upset I know they're poisoning us and I have all their own documents admitting
[54:56.640 --> 54:59.760]  it I'm looking at an eco science written by this white house science are right over
[54:59.760 --> 55:07.280]  there rebrags about it I'm upset and I don't like seeing people trapped in delusion and
[55:07.280 --> 55:16.720]  loving the delusion with preconditioned you know hypnotic programming I know I'm right
[55:16.720 --> 55:21.080]  and when you have this kill grid being set up and you have all the torture and the wars
[55:21.080 --> 55:25.280]  and homeland security saying no bill of rights and constitution and we the people are the
[55:25.280 --> 55:32.040]  target if ranting and raving gets people out of their trance which it does see at first
[55:32.040 --> 55:37.200]  it's entertainment for people I always did this naturally I didn't do it on purpose I
[55:37.200 --> 55:42.440]  just sometimes just look got out of control and it really helped make the show successful
[55:42.440 --> 55:45.760]  so now in the last few years when I really feel like ranting I don't do as much as I
[55:45.760 --> 55:50.520]  used to I used to do it out of frustration now I've gotten a little more disciplined
[55:50.520 --> 55:54.320]  and focused so I don't do it as much but with them but then when I do do it it's even more
[55:54.320 --> 56:01.600]  out of control because that's how I feel and so a lot of people like it some people don't
[56:01.600 --> 56:07.880]  I'm sorry it's real and you know you can't argue with success but there are again the
[56:07.880 --> 56:13.960]  Associated Press is in hundreds of TV stations on their websites posted and hundreds of newspapers
[56:13.960 --> 56:20.080]  I can't even count them all right now basically coming out implying that the bullet story is
[56:20.080 --> 56:26.160]  an exaggeration by us what they did is divert from the 1.4 billion find one piece of minutiae
[56:26.160 --> 56:32.720]  and claim our report was that that's basically lying by omission but AP was better than Detroit
[56:32.720 --> 56:37.520]  Free Press AP at least linked to our report so you can see what we really said which I
[56:37.520 --> 56:41.040]  have to commend actually that's better than what they usually do Detroit Free Press is
[56:41.040 --> 56:47.200]  called as conspiracy theorist yeah if no one now things really work is bad and being concerned

[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.360]  well Pulitzer prize-winning journalist who's been in a lot of serious war zones and reported
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.360]  on some of the biggest stories of our time as a Pulitzer prize winner he is chris hedges
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:53.120]  and the websites truth dig dot com he has a new book out that we're going to be breaking
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.320]  down with him today days of destruction what days of revolt I can't wait to read it and
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:04.120]  he's saying is revolt all we have left well yeah there are many forms of revolt I mean
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:10.280]  I went into you know basically preaching fit last hour but it's effective it shows my desperation
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:15.120]  it's almost like my ghost dance here wishing that we weren't going into such a fascist
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.880]  corporatist tyranny but chris hedges joins us one of the few real liberal voices that
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.960]  you can say is respectable and really makes sense and who doesn't compromise it's very
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.640]  scary to see no you know none of the main conservatives against torture secret war the
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.080]  end of the bill of rights and really hardly any liberals in fact a lot of them love it
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.400]  because it's empowering their precious state that they don't understand is an our corporate
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.160]  instrument chris we're about to go to break here in a few minutes but I didn't want to
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:49.400]  waste any time getting you on great to have you here sir tell us a little bit about the
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:57.040]  new book well it goes to the sacrifice zones the poorest pockets of the country that have
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:04.760]  been forced to kneel before unfettered corporate capitalism and and it's the kind of warning
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:10.800]  because they went first and we're next as we allow these corporate forces to reconfigure
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:18.240]  the country into a form of neo feudalism an oligarchic state backed by you know the most
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.480]  intrusive security surveillance apparatus probably in the history of humankind and I speak as
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:32.280]  somebody who covered the fall of East Germany and very familiar with the stasi state and
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.360]  you know there's there are no impediments left so you know it it looks at places like
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:42.320]  a camden new jersey which per capita is the poorest city in the united states not surprisingly
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:48.280]  also one of the most dangerous pine ridge south dakota Lakota Indian reservation where
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:54.320]  the average life expectancy for a male is 48 that is the lowest in the western hemisphere
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:01.120]  outside of Haiti the cold fields of southern west virginia one of the most minerally rich
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.800]  pockets of the united states and yet of course harbors the poorest population along with
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:12.520]  the terrible ecological devastation and finally the produce fields where these undocumented
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.480]  workers who are the perfect worker in the eyes of the corporate state because they have
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:25.520]  no legal rights they can be abused there are no benefits they work day by day they show
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.300]  up in collection centers when they don't have enough work they sleep out literally under
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:34.920]  mango trees in florida and then we finally end with the occupy movement which is again
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:40.520]  you know the with the title of the book days of destruction days of revolt that but first
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:47.200]  bubbling I think of consciousness of revolt of a recognition that we have undergone a corporate
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:54.240]  coup d'etat in slow motion and it's over citizens united probably nail the last peg
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.880]  in the coffin and civil disobediences I think all we have left now we're going to go to
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.080]  break here in a moment and come back and get into your case against the NDA and all the
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.600]  amazing work you're engaged in and just just some of the signposts that we see showing
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:15.600]  that this this from my view has been a conscious rank operation talked about 15 years ago construction
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.280]  of a system designed to implode the economy under a feudal system as you said using poverty
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:26.480]  as political control because you can say what you want about america and what it's done
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.400]  the last hundred years but even in the 40s 50s 60s there was a plan to build up the third
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:37.320]  world and stuff now it is no make everybody poor and have private cities the elites live
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:43.800]  in and it's such a evil malthusian view I want to get your well traveled expert view

[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:40.360]  deny it the NSA has been caught spying on everyone in live time totally illegal they're
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.200]  arresting people torturing in them torturing their children in front of them at Abu Ghraib
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.080]  bush brags about in his book and doesn't get in trouble even though his minions went
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:55.120]  to jail and now Obama has accelerated it and Romney signals he's going to accelerate it
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:03.160]  we're in deep trouble we've got a amazing guest joining us Pulitzer prize winning journalist
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:09.880]  who has covered you name it the Stasi the Russians and many charities he's he's been
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.680]  in high-level coverage of negotiations all over the Middle East and he pursued earlier
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:22.080]  this year over the NDA that Obama signed on December 31st when he thought no one was paying
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:30.240]  attention 2011 he has a new book just out days of destruction days of revolt we're going
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.600]  to talk about that you've only got him to the bottom of the hour he's again gracious
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.520]  to join us a very busy man and I want to talk about his NDA a suit that's having some success
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:45.000]  I want to get his take on everything that's unfolding but now we have activists put on
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.760]  terror watchers preventing protesting DNC turned out the army the ACLU here's the ACLU
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:55.880]  press released just out yesterday on it they got the document where the army DOD did it
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.840]  and they say in here that it's low-level terrorism to protest and ask the court to keep him in
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:09.280]  jail because protesting is now illegal we are seeing again the FBI caught with 12 million
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:16.640]  IDs of folks with Apple computers here joining us to break it down is Chris Hedges who I
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.960]  don't really need to go over more of his bio here most people know who he is or should
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:29.320]  know who he is but he joins us now Chris what is the state of the world in your view well
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.520]  I think you know one of the things we have to be clear about is that the assault on civil
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:41.600]  liberties which began under the Bush administration has in fact been accelerated by the Obama administration
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:47.600]  it's worse under Obama than under Bush when you tick off all the things that the Obama
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:55.000]  administration has done over the last four years refusal to restore habeas corpus interpretation
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.840]  of the 2001 authorization to use military force act as giving the executive branch the
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.920]  right to assassinate American citizens whatever you think of these figures like on where a
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.800]  lucky the Yemeni cleric and then of course a 16 year old son who was never accused of
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:16.640]  anything two weeks later the FISA amendment act which I'm one of the plaintiffs book will
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:23.880]  be heard in the Supreme Court on October 29th which retroactively made legal but under our
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.560]  constitution has always been illegal the warrantless wiretapping monitoring and eavesdropping of
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.760]  tens of millions of American citizens who have done nothing been charged with no crime
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:40.120]  and we know that all of our personal information is now being stored out in super computers
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:47.040]  in Utah the Obama administration has also employed six times the espionage act which
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:53.080]  was never designed to ferret out whistleblowers as they are using it these are people who
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:12:00.520]  have exposed war crimes in the case of the CIA official sterling who purportedly leaked
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:07.960]  this information to Jim rise at the New York Times he's used it to essentially shut down
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:14.040]  anything that counters the official government narrative and I was an investigative reporter
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:17.960]  for the New York Times I know many of the major investigative reporters and they will
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:24.120]  tell you that at this point investigating anything the government does has become impossible
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:29.440]  even on background briefings will no longer be given because people are scared of being
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.520]  charged with the espionage act as six officials have been charged which of course brings with
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:39.600]  it prison time and that this brings us to the National Defense Authorization Act which
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:45.880]  as you mentioned Alex was signed by the president on December 31st New Year's Eve of course
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:51.000]  a moment when he thought we weren't looking now the National Defense Authorization Act
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.680]  section 1021 authorizes the US government or more specifically the executive branch
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:06.640]  to condemn or label an American citizen a terrorist and not only a terrorist but in
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:12.360]  the language of that section someone who is has relationships with what they call associated
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:17.920]  forces a term that's never defined to use the military this is contravening 200 years
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:24.840]  of domestic law to detain these people hold them in military facilities strip them of
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:32.280]  due process and if the military so determines actually ship them to offshore penal colonies
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:38.280]  like Guantanamo and other black sites around the world in the language of this section
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:43.720]  until the end of hostilities whenever that is an age of permanent war that's a very
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:51.000]  long time we challenge that in federal the southern district court of New York federal
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:59.600]  judge Catherine Forrest issued a temporary injunction in essence invalidating that section
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:09.200]  of the NDA we had a final hearing the beginning of August and in which Judge Forrest it will
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:14.840]  now determine whether that temporary injunction will become permanent but we know how the
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:21.240]  Obama administration will respond if she invalidates that section of the NDA which of course I
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:27.440]  think she should they've already challenged the temporary injunction they will clearly
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:34.680]  challenge the permanent injunction if she rules that it is unconstitutional as it appears
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.960]  she will that will take it to an appellate court if they uphold the ruling it will go
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.600]  to the Supreme Court but all of this comes under the Obama administration and my frustration
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:51.480]  with self-professed liberals is that they're entranced with the rhetoric of Obama and utterly
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:59.760]  ignore the facts utterly ignore what he has done and as you mentioned earlier I think what
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:07.040]  we are seeing is in essence a rewriting of the legal code to criminalize any form of
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.680]  legitimate dissent and that's because the corporate state corporate power understands
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.120]  very well what's coming both in terms of the environmental crisis and the economic
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:22.400]  crisis and they want the legal mechanisms to shut it down you know it's interesting
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:28.800]  that in the August in the last hearing in Judge Forrest's courtroom she as the judge
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:36.200]  actually brought up the detention of 110,000 Japanese Americans who you know because of
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:44.360]  their ethnicity were sent to internment camps again without any kind of legal recourse and
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.760]  said that this section of the NDA essentially sets that precedent.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.840]  We are now reaching the Alexander Schultz and Niedsen type moment asking will we burn
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.640]  later in the camps wishing we'd done something and now three months ago the army document
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.960]  came out for reeducation centers the army admitted in a press release that our document
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.200]  was real but we shouldn't have it and another public document for gun confiscation during
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:14.680]  crises they're buying armored vehicles they bought 1.4 billion rounds of ammo the media
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:21.680]  spends it to say hey they need 174,000 rounds of ammo no it's 1.4 billion so we're seeing
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.040]  all sorts of propaganda pull a surprise winning investigative journalist who's covered police
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.040]  states worldwide Chris Hedges joins us we're going to talk about his book here in a moment
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.080]  we're going to skip this network break so we have more time with him what is the ruling
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.160]  class thinking because we've always had different corrupt elites and things but there was still
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.320]  an understanding even for the ultra wealthy and powerful that you want checks and balances
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:49.440]  going back to Magna Carta because other elites can come in and rob you and that nobody wants
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.240]  to live in a society that's not free I mean free societies are more productive they're
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:00.760]  happier they're better what has happened to the ruling class that they're going I mean
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:06.920]  the Stalin Mao Hitler route I mean this is I mean earlier in the shorter segment I'd
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.520]  like you to recap that you pointed out you've covered a lot of historical events that happen
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:16.280]  as they happen this is one of the nastiest most scientifically crafted over the top
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.920]  I mean so many things that are in 1984 have now been surpassed and now they're getting
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.480]  ready for the physical roundups I don't think people understand who haven't looked at history
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:32.000]  like you and others have just how dark it is is my point yeah I mean in the language
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.600]  of patriotism these people are traders and that's the difference as you point out between
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.160]  the older ruling elite and I come out of the working class there were certainly no friends
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:47.280]  to working men and women frankly but they cared about the sustenance of the nation the
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:52.400]  new ruling elite is global it in the language of business is quite willing to harvest the
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:58.520]  nation that's how you've seen manufacturing jobs shipped overseas and you look at labor
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.800]  conditions in southern China where Apple products I mean all sorts of products that we buy are
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:11.400]  made and it's out of Dick and Sony in England you know 70 hour work weeks abusive conditions
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:17.080]  you know no labor protection and what they tell now workers around the world is that
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:22.320]  in order to be competitive they have to be competitive in essence with prison labor in
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:28.960]  China or sweatshop workers in Bangladesh who make 22 cents exactly where Foxcom that Apple
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:35.720]  uses were being lectured by Al Gore here domestically they have to put suicide nets up yeah you
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:42.360]  know what happens is when they don't meet their quotas and there's a good book by a
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:48.080]  Berkeley sociologist who's the Chinese origin or went and wrote about it when wrote about
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.960]  these conditions when they don't meet their quotas and they don't make the profits there
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.840]  are workers who will work and actually not be paid and at the end of the month they will
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:04.680]  climb up to the roof of these overcrowded dormitories and jump off and commit suicide and that's
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:09.240]  the world that these corporations have created I mean they and that's the difference between
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.800]  the old robber barons the Rockefellers the melons the Carnegie's and the new robber
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:19.840]  barons who are quite willing to sacrifice the nation indeed are for profit they you
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:26.040]  know they when they do their speculative gambling on Wall Street and their bubbles crash they
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:30.760]  loot the US Treasury and then they make the rest of us pay for it through austerity programs
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:36.000]  you see the same thing in Europe because of course it's a global corporate movement so
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.840]  that when Papandreou in Greece announces okay you want austerity I'm going to put it to a
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:46.360]  referendum he's gone within a week and he's replaced with a banker technocrat that's you
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:54.240]  know that that is essentially pliable and and a puppet of the banks and of the corporate
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:01.160]  interest this is a global phenomena we're not exempt from it and and and and these these
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.800]  essentially narrow oligarchic corporate forces that we see it you know they make all their
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.480]  money here and then they move overseas so they don't have to pay any taxes well they're
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:15.000]  moving to armored redoubts on on Pacific Islands and admitting they are and they're bragging
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.160]  that they're converting us to a tyranny and training the police that we're their enemy
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:26.520]  I mean this is a nightmare scenario and and and the attitude is Americans are uppity we're
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:30.960]  going to bring you down we're going to cut you down to size while lecturing people who
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:36.280]  are on welfare because they've destroyed the jobs base while they are the biggest recipients
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:41.880]  of corporate welfare contracts bailouts and then in Europe I've looked at the numbers
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:47.360]  almost all of the real debt is owed by the big zombie banks and they've done this trick
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:52.160]  of convincing everyone that the Europeans are lazy and now today they're reporting that
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:58.000]  they want Greeks to work six-day work weeks and then most the money is to be paid to the
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.040]  bankers that Greece is having to hand their islands over to yeah well that's precisely
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:11.240]  it and you know that they they will corporations know only one word and that the more and they
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:16.600]  are going to push and push and push you know like all sort of elites that have unplugged
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.680]  themselves from the reality around them they're woefully out of touch with what most Americans
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:29.680]  are undergoing and and and it is always the ruling elites that finally determine the parameters
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:35.800]  and configurations of revolt revolt and rebellion and you know they because they have not responded
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:41.240]  rationally as the columnist Paul Krugman writes week after week to both the economic and political
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:47.440]  crisis it means that there will be a backlash of what exactly it will look like how it will
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:52.080]  appear when it will appear I don't know I've covered you know the revolutions in Eastern
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:56.960]  Europe uprisings in Palestine the war in Yugoslavia but I do know especially having
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.720]  spent the last two years on this book in the poorest pockets of the United States without
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:08.640]  any question that is coming and the establishment knows that and is making preparations for
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:15.440]  it I think to use that crisis as a pretext to grab even more power if you expand on this
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:22.400]  out into the future what type of world do you think the ultra rich who are obviously
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:29.040]  monopoly capitalist what type of world are they planning on building in essence a kind
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:37.800]  of feudal system where you have a tiny filthy rich oligarchically a small sort of core of
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:43.320]  corporate managers public relations people probably an essence of propaganda and then
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:48.200]  the rest of us hanging on by our fingertips and you know interestingly enough this completely
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:56.160]  replicates the political and economic structure that Orwell painted in 1984 with Oceania where
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:01.320]  you had an inner party of 2 to 4% an outer party of about 12% of the rest or what he
[01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:05.480]  calls prole that that's that's already I mean all you have to do is look out your window
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:12.440]  at a decaying infrastructure closing schools closing fire departments you know closing libraries
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:21.120]  a long term unemployment and underemployment coupled with you know this this kind of constant
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:26.080]  a sustenance of criminal enterprise I mean look at Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs is bailed
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:32.920]  out every penny on the dollar by the American taxpayer and now we give them in essence 0%
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.480]  interest loans so that they can gamble I don't know what it is not capitalism I don't even
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.400]  know what to call it and then to loan it back to us at 1020 30 or more percent and they
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:47.480]  often don't loan talk to any small businessman they can't get loans I mean and why should
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:51.280]  the banks loan they've got all the money they could ever want taxpayer back money expanding
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:59.240]  on this I went and saw Dinesh D'Souza's film that the 2016 Obama's America and and they
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:06.040]  were saying that Obama was anti-colonialist when really I see this is a new colonialism
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:10.960]  where it's these mega banks and mega elites that are destroying the nation states that
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:16.560]  were the old cores of the Empire not just exploiting the third world they brought the
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:23.200]  cancer home but then they spin it that Obama is an anti-colonialist and so that's why he's
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.040]  doing what he's doing I mean it's an amazing spin yeah I would agree with you and you know
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:33.000]  we actually call the places that you know places like him an internal colonnades because
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.960]  it is a form of colonialism and you know just to go back to your point earlier about the
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:44.880]  militarization of police you know it I think when you look at the the war on so-called
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:49.920]  war on drugs you see that the portal the way they entered it so that if there's a night
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:57.600]  raid now in Oakland you have Kevlar plated command helicopters command centers people
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:05.600]  dressed in black carrying m16s it looks no difference from a night raid in Fallujah and
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:12.560]  that's the point that as the disintegration continues the more brutal forms of control
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:20.640]  that are used on the outer reaches of empire my migrate back to the heart of empire and
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:26.320]  the major corporations then plan to even implode the old homelands and then just have a giant
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:34.040]  squalor that they rule over from private heavily armed redoubts and cities and that's now even
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:39.240]  their admitted plan the rand corporation is saying what a hellish vision what a hellish
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:44.600]  world it sounds like something the devil would come up with yeah and you have corporations
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.600]  like bechtel buying up all the clean water in chili and other places because they know
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.640]  that pretty soon water you know water for most of us will be contaminated we'll have
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:59.400]  to pay for it just like everything else yeah I mean they have a you know if you sit down
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.200]  inside the NSA or any other there's sort of analysis of where we're going it's not going
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:09.760]  to be much different from yours or mine it is just doesn't make it out into the mainstream
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:15.080]  well that's right they've got British Ministry of Defense reports Pentagon reports admitting
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:22.000]  a hellish world and then if I cover it the media calls it pessimism porn won't this be
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.040]  the defining moment when your case goes to Supreme Court if they don't uphold the Constitution
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.440]  I mean this will be overthrowing Magna Carta habeas corpus I mean this is probably one
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:37.760]  of the biggest cases ever what is it like to be at the center of this well it's sort
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:43.240]  of bizarre in a sense because I agree with you I mean it is and the judge agrees with
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:51.200]  us that this is just this amazing attempt to essentially strip us of of of the rule
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.520]  of law due process and yet it doesn't get covered it doesn't get covered because both
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.840]  the Republicans and the Democrats are essentially beholden to corporate power and the security
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:06.240]  and surveillance state I mean this was a bipartisan effort is sponsored by Carl Levin and John
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:13.880]  McCain and so because the media won't step outside these very narrow parameters which
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:20.240]  essentially stretch from A to B that's what's done me the most how egregious the assault
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:26.160]  is how naked the assault is and how it's virtually uncovered I mean the New York Times did write
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:32.320]  a good editorial about it after the temporary injunction was issued but you know you know
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:36.120]  if you look on the airwaves it doesn't exist and yet you have all these people sort of
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:44.000]  shouting about the Constitution and civil liberties and and here in an incredibly overt
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:55.440]  attempt to to take away you know our right to trial silence and now I see a lot of conservatives
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.720]  going along with this when the government's now said don't worry about Al Qaeda and we're
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.920]  going to use them and others to take down Syria and Libyan places but you know the new
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:09.160]  enemy is domestic threats and they're out like they've done with Muslims provocaturing
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:14.600]  you know militia groups in Michigan and things trying to get some type of civil war going
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:19.840]  so they can now target the American people as the enemy this is very cold blooded and
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.360]  I don't think it is a left right issue you know you know the American conservative just
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:32.920]  ran a long article called in defense of Bradley Manning raising precisely these points and
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.400]  that's why I think that you know the political theater of the republicans and the democrats
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:49.120]  you know is really a kind of a mass money drenched spectacle that diverts us from debating
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:55.160]  yes issues that I don't think that you know really you know for anybody who cares about
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.680]  the rule of law and the democratic state no matter what your political opinion is there
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.920]  should be any divide on at all well that's right we're all Americans we're all humans
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.960]  and if America becomes this pure tyranny boy the world better look out if they think we've
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:13.240]  been doing bad stuff so far Chris look out you know I know you've got to go I'll talk
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.280]  to you briefly during the break if you could say five more I want to come back and talk
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.480]  about the book but if not folks no no sure let's let's do it okay days of destruction
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.240]  days of revolt I have not read it yet I will read it because let me tell you when I see
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:30.880]  Chris Hedges videos online he's focused he knows what he's talking about he's articulate
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:35.240]  I get mad just yelling scream I wish I was like him but then I'm just a constitutionalist
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:39.240]  I want my bill of rights I want my constitution if that's liberal that's conservative then
[01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:43.440]  that's what I am but I just love Chris Hedges and he's so so so good to come on and talk
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.720]  about this with us we'll be right back to talk about his book for a few minutes stay

[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:26.960]  the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones okay we've got about six seven
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:31.920]  minutes left with Mr. Hedges so holding over with us Pulitzer prize winning author journalist
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.560]  who's covered some of the most dangerous places in the world and he's saying that well what
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:40.480]  he sees here in America I wanted to expand on that is the worst he's ever seen so far
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:45.080]  I want him to elaborate on that because because it's intriguing if I went over his bio here
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:50.840]  for folks that may not know who who Chris Hedges is he's he's been over 50 countries he's
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:55.240]  covered the big battle zones he's covered world leaders he's covered the the the Stasi
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:01.120]  and their activities just amazing he's got a new book out that we're going to be obviously
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.200]  breaking down as soon as I get a chance to read it days of destruction days of revolt
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:11.040]  but I wanted him to go over basically what the book covers because earlier he started
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:15.400]  mentioning that it's a reservation program and I've interviewed a lot of Native Americans
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:20.360]  who've gone over the history and they point out that Indian policy became what Hitler
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:24.920]  used and I'd actually read that in Hitler's own writings that he used that model of the
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:30.400]  concentration camp off the reservation the company store that keeps control of the people
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:36.760]  keeps them in poverty their life expectancy and that that's the whole model now of this
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:41.120]  corporate state get rid of your jobs and then give you a pittance to barely even keep
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:47.360]  you at subsistence destroying destinies destroying societies so you can control them and now
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.120]  the corporate state doesn't want even free market competition it's coming in with regulation
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:57.480]  shutting down what's left of our industry I mean it's a cold-blooded systematic military
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:03.280]  style takeover so Chris a breakdown your new book which I can't wait to read days of destruction
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.400]  days of revolt well yeah I mean Alex I think you nailed it I mean that's why we begin with
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:14.640]  Pine Ridge because that's where it all began and originally you know those reservations
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:21.840]  were openly called prisoner or war camps and you're right they they make self-efficiency
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:30.240]  impossible and create this kind of culture of dependence which destroys dignity self-worth
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:35.280]  community with all of the attendant problems it's why you have an eighty percent estimated
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:41.480]  eighty percent alcoholism rate on Pine Ridge and everywhere we went whether it was Camden
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.720]  whether it was the Southwest Virginia where people are taking oxy cotton what they call
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:55.720]  hillbilly heroin you know they they they the sort of the drugs and the alcohol and that's
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:00.160]  the size people to the kind of pain and the suffering to which they have been reduced
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:05.520]  and I think the reservation model is in fact one that we spent a lot of time reporting on
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:13.600]  and looking at for precisely that reason you know when you reduce people to a level of
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:20.440]  desperation it becomes far easier to control them and that's what we're seeing I mean you
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:26.800]  know just all sorts of just in the last few weeks the refusal to restore unemployment
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:31.600]  benefits for hundreds of thousands of Americans which means tens of thousands of these people
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:39.160]  will eventually lose their homes a number now over six million you know that there's
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:45.000]  just the Obamacare is another example it's a corporate essentially the equivalent of
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.960]  the bank bailout bill for the pharmaceutical and insurance industry is four hundred seventy
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:55.080]  seven billion dollars in subsidies and of course they can keep anyone such as myself
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.920]  knows who doesn't have a company plan keep jacking up copayments and premiums and I've
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.280]  got interrupts here the only scholar out there on the so-called left but you're just a human
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:08.600]  who wants freedom who's honest at the insurance companies wrote it and then the right wing
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.080]  gives Obama cover and goes how dare you want to make us commies when the whole thing was
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:18.640]  written to let corporations control the quality of care make you buy their product and jack
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:23.600]  up the price I mean it's such a fraud but then you've got all the people on the left
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:31.240]  who mean well supporting it through ignorance yeah it is it is I mean you know that this
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:36.880]  is I think a very telling piece of legislation because it was written in the heritage foundation
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:41.720]  it was first put into practice by Mitt Romney when he was governor in two thousand six in
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:47.920]  Massachusetts and then adopted by Barack Obama incredible care is Obamacare and that is a
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:54.000]  kind of window into the kind of false debate that go back and forth because both of these
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:02.040]  two political parties you know are slavishly devoted to corporate interest obama obama
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:09.400]  care is essentially forcing us to buy defective corporate product a for-profit product it's
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:14.440]  staggering and what is the revolt angle of the book is again I haven't had a chance to
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:19.880]  read again order today I think it's just this understanding that we the formal mechanisms
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:26.440]  of power are not going to defend civil liberties or our interests or institute the kinds of
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:33.720]  reforms that will bring back the kind of egalitarian society that I think we all want that that
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:40.000]  now resistance has to come outside those formal mechanisms of power that means acts of civil
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.200]  disobedience I was arrested with occupied protesters in front of Goldman Sachs go into
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:50.320]  jails more time than I care to donate to the federal government but I don't I don't think
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:56.320]  we have any option left and I'm not naive enough to even promise you that it will
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.840]  work but I can tell you that the system is so corrupt you know you take New York City
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:08.160]  police and you look closely most of the egregious assaults against protesters were carried out
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:12.960]  by the white shirted officers who are earning about a hundred ten thousand a year there
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.720]  was a lot of fraternization with the blue uniform police because these corporations
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:22.760]  hire them like Goldman Sachs and Citibank as rent a cop for private security for thirty
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:28.040]  seven dollars an hour in their off time so they can you know make some money well Goldman
[01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:31.880]  Sachs gave them what was it was some giant amount of money the week before as a pure
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:38.120]  gift right to the police a public bribe yeah a JP Morgan I think it was yeah JP Morgan
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.640]  was like exactly I mean and I think you know when I cover the fall of East Germany what
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:48.080]  happens is when the foot soldiers are no longer willing to defend the elite you know when
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.280]  Eric Hanukkah the dictator in East Germany sent down an elite paratroop division to Leipzig
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.920]  where I was and they wouldn't fire on the crowd Hanukkah lasted another week in power
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:06.120]  and I think that you know in fact part of the reason I'm guessing that the NDAA was pushed
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:11.200]  through I think is because there's a kind of fear among these corporate oligarchs that
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.280]  the police won't protect them well that's one of my final questions here I got a few
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.680]  to race through I want to know what else is in the book so people will definitely get
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.600]  it because your ideas are right on from my own research but so well laid out that was
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.360]  my next issue I'll guarantee you that if things continue to implode the people they know that
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.120]  aren't going to shut up and go along or people like Chris Edges people like Alex Jones people
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.440]  that they know are controlled by conscience not because I'm some goody two shoes but
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.640]  because I don't want to live in a fascist state I mean I want my children to have a
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:49.360]  future and they're really trying to set the precedent for this as they force people into
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:56.080]  a revolt kind of arresting in which they admit scooping up people that they see as leaders
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:01.880]  yeah I mean I think that you once you create that legal mechanism that essentially permits
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:06.360]  that or gives to the state that kind of power then you're in really serious trouble they
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:12.720]  use it on marginal elements within the society first Muslims black black anarchists whatever
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:18.360]  militia members but you don't want to give them that kind of legal power which we unfortunately
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:26.880]  we've already done because they they use the sort of fringe elements as a way to justify
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.760]  that kind of power and then they turn it on the rest of us that's exactly right in history
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:37.280]  has just worn that out you know in conflict after conflict that I've covered and watched
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:43.160]  what about geopolitically it seems like the world is kind of waking up to the fact that
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:48.880]  the United States has been seized by very evil forces yeah I mean you know I was quite
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.240]  an opponent of the invasion of Iraq on that issue and I had been the Middle East bureau
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:42:00.920]  chief of the New York Times because you know it was not only you know a tactical blunder
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:05.680]  but probably one of the most strategic blunders we made in essence throwing the balance of
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:14.080]  power to Iran yeah I think that unfortunately you know we don't have a lot of friends left
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:22.720]  because of I think very misguided imperial projects that again of course I mean the war
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:29.400]  in Afghanistan which let's be frank we're losing you know there are a handful of corporations
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.560]  Halliburton and and Raytheon and on and on and on that for whom this they make money
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.200]  is an all wars could the Anglo-American establishment kind of stall and not have a Merlin wall moment
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:47.200]  but just kind of collapse like the Soviet Union I mean it's all it's that's the big
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:53.080]  question I mean collapse is coming how does it come does it does it come gradually is
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:59.040]  there kind of a slow decline like the Ottoman Empire does it implode these are questions
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:04.240]  that I ask all the time but I don't have a definitive answer well I think they're going
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:09.160]  to try to go Hitler crazy and launch a bunch of wars that are so bad everybody kind of
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:13.160]  lines up because we're in so much trouble well yeah the government's corrupt but we're
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:18.120]  you know fighting Russia and China now so let's line up we just lost 500,000 people
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:22.880]  I mean I think the elite are that crazy and then the way they're digging in the way they're
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:27.400]  getting everything ready looks like they're gearing up for World War three at a scale
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:33.920]  much bigger than the Cold War the COG the armored pillboxes the weapons cashing studying
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:39.000]  history Chris in closing I'm not just trying to be a fearmonger here I'm scared I mean
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.320]  I've I've studied history I'm a history buff and they're digging in for what looks like
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:48.440]  not just a war with the people but a war with everybody else well you know that says Randolph
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:53.480]  Bourne said in World War one he said war is the health of the state by which he meant
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:59.400]  that when the state declares war you're right everybody lines up behind it you know in the
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:03.880]  name of patriotism and everything else and it isn't a very effective measure as it was
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:09.360]  in World War one to essentially crush any form of dissent so yeah you're right I mean
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:15.640]  the history has has shown that to be a very effective tactic for despotic states to channel
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:22.200]  energy and rage and mute internal dissent by creating an internal enemy and going after
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:26.400]  it yeah it's I don't I don't put it past them well hopefully your book will wake people
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:30.800]  up and I know it's got amazing illustrations and it tells a little bit about the book that
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.080]  you haven't covered and about the cartoonist that you worked with and this is Joe Sacco
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:40.760]  who is an amazing reporter in his own right does whole graphic novels that he reports
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:49.280]  out we met in Bosnia in 1995 and I think one of the reasons I found him so important
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:54.320]  in the book 50 pages of illustrations as well as comic panels sort of profiling people's
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:00.400]  lives is that so many of these Americans by the corporate media have been rendered invisible
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.960]  and I think one of the goals of the book was to make them visible and Sacco did that gave
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:12.000]  the book a kind of punch that pure prose wouldn't have had do you have hope for the future I
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.080]  mean would you say it's a 60% chance we're going to go into this total tyranny or is
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:21.920]  it a 70% or a 20% I mean what's your there's few people who've traveled more seen more
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:27.000]  reported on more so I really respect your view on this I know our listeners do I mean looking
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.040]  into that crystal ball what's our odds I think it looks pretty bleak but I don't think we
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:38.800]  can use the word hope unless we active really resist every way possible you know which is
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:45.760]  why you know I was in protest outside Goldman Sachs why I sued Barack Obama and Leon Panetta
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:52.960]  over the NDA I think it's a kind of moral imperative to resist and but at the same time
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:46:00.920]  you know a very sort of sober view of it doesn't look great have you been threatened yeah but
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:06.200]  over my opposition to the Iraq war and then interestingly by black black anarchists who
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:12.200]  I've been very critical of well I've yeah most of them are run my feds well Chris edges
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:19.120]  oh yeah and that's what I found from my research again your website is also a great place for
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:24.880]  people to visit tell us about your website truth dig yeah this is Bob's here's website
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:28.600]  out of LA I write a column every Monday for them all right well thank you so much Chris
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:32.960]  thank you Alex all right there he goes I ended up spending more time with us man I wish he
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:38.680]  was wrong I wish I was wrong you know last hour I kind of went into this ranting rage
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:45.760]  about the tyranny we face but I mean I bet my family that we can beat this I mean let
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:52.680]  me tell you if I didn't think we could turn this around I would leave the United States
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:57.560]  not that somewhere else would be perfect but I would get out of the fight because let me
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:04.000]  tell you something the people running things have made a friend with evil they have decided
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.720]  that they're going to rule the world they've got the power they've got this historic moment
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:14.160]  they're going to use it and we've got to decide we've got our historic moment is human beings
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:19.960]  that stand for freedom and justice to resist these people because you know Chris Hedges
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.680]  talks about how they want to render us impotent and where we can't have jobs in the future
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:30.480]  that is the policy of the globalist and you know Obama is not anti-colonialist colonialism
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:37.520]  became what you call globalist and then the right wing packages anti-colonialist as communist
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.480]  when the communists are actually running their own form of collectivist colonialism that
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.040]  then implodes and is taken over by the bankers I mean we're facing such a sophisticated situation
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.320]  you know people say well are you for occupier against it the globalist talked about occupy
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:56.200]  because their computers were able to predict that there would be flare ups at that moment
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:00.720]  against the banks and that people knew that the banker bailouts were a corporate transference
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:09.560]  of wealth from the people to the elite just a robbery a private taxation mechanism so they
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:15.000]  announced everybody who's mad at corruption wall street show up then the democratic operative
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.120]  show up a lot of other activists as well Soros is unable to take control of it that was going
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:24.200]  to be kind of the revolutionary arm of the Obama second election but with the corporates
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:29.880]  running it the occupy folks got wise to that didn't work so then they flushed them and
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:37.600]  Obama in what 37 locations nationwide and in multiple whole bunch of states 14 states
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:44.720]  had people arrested in midnight raids with directed by the feds folks when your police
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:50.200]  are being directed by feds to scoop up protesters you're not in Kansas anymore you're in a dangerous
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:54.440]  police state and what people don't get is well I don't care about police state I want cops
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:58.200]  and guys with machine guns on every corner because it's for al-Qaeda let's see it's not
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:04.280]  for al-Qaeda now it's for you and it's because they're planning to take your bank account
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:08.720]  they're planning to devalue your dollar they're planning to take your pension fund and I don't
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:12.840]  mean the government pension fund I'm talking about your private ones they're already doing
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:18.960]  that in Europe putting taxes on them and stuff I mean I've got the financial news on Europe
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:25.480]  I'm going to get to after well I guess Dr. Stallman's joining us I'm almost out of time
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:29.320]  where is my financial stack I mean we just had a few of these right now this is so serious
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:36.860]  folks and for the minions that are serving this we're not coming back from this okay
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:41.400]  you notice the deeper we get into globalism now to get any of it things get worse because
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:49.720]  it's meant to be bad if they write white papers on it it's horrible it's not my opinion we're
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:58.520]  signing on to evil it's happened the same robber barren family's funded Hitler okay
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:04.840]  we're in trouble these elites put Mao into power because they wanted to have a strong
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:10.880]  guy take over our government put Mao say tongue into power that's been declassified for about
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:18.200]  10 years I just got chills saying that do you realize under under globalist funding he killed
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:27.280]  the Chinese say 85 million people the CIA says 64 million man they they aren't playing
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:34.720]  games they want to reorganize and kind of erase the disk clear the table in America
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:41.040]  and Europe and they are lining up the troops in the military to do it and they're gonna
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:46.960]  do most of it with starvation and man I just don't want to go down this road I mean they've
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:51.840]  got America in the guillotine and I'm saying let's get our head out of here and let's get

[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:27.960]  hell and I have all the documents I should have brought this up to me I'll be about eugenics
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.760]  about how they would give the blankets with smallpox and poison food water to the natives
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:41.200]  to make them weak and kill the strongest members they kill people that tried to lead and again
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:46.460]  that was done to a minority that's how cultures always do it but then it ends up getting exported
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:51.000]  on to everybody and now the troops have their death benefits that they take part of their
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.520]  checkout of if they sign on to it and just steal it and it was in Bloomberg and AP a
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:59.280]  couple times two years ago and never again it's like yeah we take the death benefits
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:04.160]  of vets from world war two right through to the current conflict yeah we run a scam on
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:07.400]  them and you have the big banks launder the drug money and run the aircraft and yeah the
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.080]  troops grow the opium and yeah the troops are dying and have all these increased cancers
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:15.760]  and their kids are deformed from DEU and so what hey did we tell you we're going to forcibly
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:20.040]  shoot your kids up in school and make them you know have abortions and say that they
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:23.720]  gave consent at 12 to have an abortion because we threw them in a truck and took them and
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:30.640]  had them sign a form I mean the government is is just power grabbing and it's moving
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:36.040]  faster and faster and I'm sitting there watching it happen look at it and then I look at my

[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.840]  bad it was the danger is letting this win people think oh it's dangerous to fight this

[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:15.920]  it I mean if I was a cop and there was somebody filming me down the street at you know it's
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.840]  something I was doing I wouldn't run over and arrest them you know that's the first
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:25.360]  amendment you know they're not a terrorist shame on you you take their right away you're

[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.760]  they're going to stage terror I did it before look look now look what happens see they did

[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:27.920]  doesn't protect you it endangers you it allows this to happen Moody's lowers outlook for
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.480]  European Union's credit rating to negative but that was but I thought they gave the foreign
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:37.560]  bankers all their money that would fix it oh as I told you it's only going to get worse

[02:03:55.640 --> 02:04:04.440]  just have no idea what a threat is it's like in the opening scene of 2001 space odyssey where the
[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:08.200]  animals aren't yet you know being hunted by man so they're not afraid of man
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:13.880]  they're just kind of standing around that's that's what animals really do when they've
[02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:18.280]  never had a predator after them and see i've still got all my instincts for whatever reason
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:21.800]  when i see predators the stuff being set up i'm jumping up and down like a monkey

[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:45.480]  there's a lot of evidence pointing to this and my point is why would you have all this power and
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:49.960]  then one of sexually abused people and you know getting their face and things and dominate them
[02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:54.360]  same reason the tsa wants to see if someone bin laden's in your underwear it's about

[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:03.960]  that because there's new lawsuits new new allegations the hysteria and the fear is

[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:51.480]  and all this stuff against the american people uh so we're going to be breaking all of that down as
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:57.640]  well now joining us to really give us his perspective on what's happening is dr richard
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:02.360]  stallman is a software developer and software freedom activist he developed a new that's the
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:07.480]  basis of so many of the systems out there today he graduated from harvard 74 with a b a in physics
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:12.040]  and has received many awards doctorates and professorships from his extensive work in january
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:19.000]  4 he resigned from mit to start the gnu or janu operating system meant to be entirely free
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:24.200]  software and he has been the project leader ever since and i'm not going to read his whole bio
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:31.080]  most people know who he is if they've had any type of brain but stallman dot org is one of the uh
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:36.920]  websites and he uh fights uh against the the the the overuse of copyright as a tyranny to
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:40.440]  i mean to use my own word he can correct me if i'm wrong but the reason i wanted to get him on
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:46.920]  today is i remember dr stallman when i was just getting on the internet 15 16 years ago
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:51.640]  warning that they're building back doors and things it also screws up how the software works
[02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:56.920]  that's why you want the open software and he's like the you know that they're tracking you they're
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:02.120]  they're listening to you and then now it's just google's cars admittedly driving around with
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:07.640]  nsa contracts hacking your computer stealing your passcodes totally illegal they don't get in trouble
[02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:12.360]  uh the fbi's been caught over and over again it's in the telecommunications acts they've got
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:16.520]  all the access codes to the iphone's the droids and now they're denying it even though they've
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:23.320]  been caught uh you've just got a total 1984 society with the smart meters now interfacing
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:29.880]  with hardwired tech in the dishwashers the clothes washers the the the clock radios they're
[02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:34.760]  making you pay for the tech as part of your purchase uh again first guy i heard talk about
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:41.080]  that was dr stallman and he got criticized for that and and and so i mean how far does it go when
[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:46.200]  the cia director since the last time dr stallman was on probably six months ago has now come out
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:52.600]  at a public conference at in cutel at a cia funding conference and says yeah we're using everything
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:58.680]  to listen to you it's all got back doors haha so we've gone from denying it just five six years
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:03.400]  ago with bush to now it's just in your face i wanted to get his take on that and then all this
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:07.240]  talk of hacking the brain the rest of it we asked him what he thought of that dr stallman great
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:12.840]  to have you on with us sir hi thanks i should point out though that i never talk about making
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:18.200]  software quote open unquote because that's the term used by the people i know you you're the
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:22.920]  expert i'm using the wrong semantic sure sure okay we'll give us the right semantics where i
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:28.920]  talk about free soft free free freedom respecting software with software either the users control
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:35.000]  the program or the program controls the users with free software the users control the program
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.040]  and that way we've got a chance of making sure it does what we want it to do and not the other
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:45.800]  things we don't want it to do with proprietary software it's the program that controls the users
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:52.360]  and the users typically can't change it and they can't figure out what it's doing and back doors
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:59.800]  and other malicious features are known in many widely used proprietary programs for instance
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:06.920]  there's microsoft windows it has known surveillance features that people have detected over the years
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:12.840]  it's they're not easy to see but people have encountered them and it has features specifically
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:20.520]  to restrict what users can do these are known as digital handcuffs or drm and it has back doors
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:27.000]  now there's one back door in windows that was explicitly made for the police although i
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:34.040]  usually prefer to call them the thugs and it's designed to let them make
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:40.280]  write a program on a pen drive and when they stick that pen drive into the machine it takes control
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.920]  and they can then do anything to it but there's another back door known in windows that allows
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:54.760]  remote installation of software changes now that's a universal back door it means that
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:03.800]  microsoft using that back door can do absolutely anything to a machine running windows any malicious
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:10.920]  feature that is not present in windows today could be remotely installed it might be there
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:19.800]  tomorrow or next week so basically windows has zero security when people know that windows has
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:24.760]  weak security but they're actually looking at only half the situation when they say that they're
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:30.440]  thinking about security against unknown third parties but what about the security against
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:38.600]  microsoft or anyone that has microsoft's cooperation well in that case given that microsoft can
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:45.320]  remotely install software changes the extent of windows security and against microsoft or
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:55.160]  microsoft friends is zero literally zero now if we look at the i things we see that they have
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:02.840]  malicious features too uh two different spy features were found and then they were removed
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:12.280]  but there could be more and the the digital handcuffs of the i things are the nastiest ever
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:18.120]  because apple pioneered the practice of censoring applications of restricting
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:25.800]  what users can install into their computers and there's also a back door that allows remote
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:32.840]  deletion of applications that are installed and then if we look at android well a large part of
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:39.400]  android is in a theoretical sense somehow free software but in practice it's not an android
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:49.080]  market is proprietary software which censors applications and has back doors so you've got
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:55.080]  non-free software with malicious features almost anywhere you look flash players another example
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:16:01.640]  it has a known surveillance feature which helps websites do surveillance on their visitors and
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:09.240]  it has uh digital handcuffs so this demonstrates by the way that it doesn't really make any
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:15.320]  difference if the program is gratis flash player after all is available at zero price
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:21.800]  dr stahlman couldn't we just interrupt for a moment couldn't it moral to demand a law
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:28.360]  for consumers where you can either get the iphone with all the spy tech or without the
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:32.360]  course one without would be probably half the price from some of the numbers i've seen
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:40.280]  to where it's so immoral to not tell consumers they're being paid uh they're paying for mandated
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:47.080]  globally and and by regional governments mandated spy tech and then you're never even being told
[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:52.520]  that is so you know they would charge more if they couldn't spy on you because the information
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:58.760]  they get is valuable but in fact you wouldn't be able to make it work without the spy technology
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:04.280]  because it's not as if they say all right here's the stuff that users are going to really use and
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:11.480]  here's the other components that are there just to spy no it's the same components that are doing
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:19.960]  all the things and so the only way they could remove the spying is if they made is if they
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:26.200]  somehow decided to be ethical and then how could you trust it anyway if the users don't have the
[02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:31.800]  source code if the users can't build and run their own version you can never tell whether it's
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:36.760]  spying and it's the same thing with gmo they've been caught in designing trojan horses into that
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:40.360]  let me ask you this question there was a big hub of of course you're one of the leading experts
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:45.640]  that can answer this question but i tried to study it that the chinese government was building
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:50.920]  back doors into all the chips that our military is getting but then i was researching all these
[02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:56.280]  major platforms and governments under the telecommunications act and and and other agreements
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:02.040]  they are demanding this be built in so they can get in and then sure it's going to end up in their
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:08.520]  systems too and so it's causing such a big problem and then they say give us control of the internet
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:15.560]  because of uh vulnerabilities vulnerabilities they demanded be built in it could very well be true
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:21.160]  it's the sort of thing that you've got to expect governments to do and i'm sad to say the u.s.
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:28.040]  government is no longer one that we could expect to be any better in these issues than the chinese
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:34.200]  government but i mean why would governments tell you know all the chip makers you got to put back
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:39.160]  doors in it obviously that's going to create a problem i don't know for certain that that has
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:46.120]  happened i'd love to see uh an article showing evidence that that has occurred uh all i've seen
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:51.880]  is speculation that there might be back doors oh no no i can't know sir i can get this to you i mean
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.440]  it's kind of like to tell him see it so far i haven't seen it so i don't know well i mean i mean
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:03.240]  here's a quick example the telecommunications act of 96 mandated the gps triangulation in all the
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:11.800]  phones be ubiquitous just by october 1st 2001 and it gave them i think was 10 billion dollars to do it
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:17.800]  and and yeah what they do is they go in and set standards on these systems that that then they have
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:23.000]  the companies later give them the codes to it's kind of like i was told that's the specific thing
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:31.000]  yes it's required for phones to have gps in them there was a free software cell phone made in which
[02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:38.680]  the weather to transmit any information from gps is under the control of the user's free software
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:45.960]  and the user really can say no i don't want you sending out any gps coordinates however the problem
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:52.840]  is the triangulation and gps are different gps is where the phone figures out the satellites where
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:59.400]  it is and then transmits that data to the phone via via triangulation giving that thing via the gps

[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:18.920]  other things is on with us dr richard stallman stallman dot org is gracious to have to spend
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:23.080]  time with us a very busy individual traveling the world haven't able to get him all the last six
[02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:29.080]  months has been all over the planet doing so much i want to get into canoe what is it for
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:33.480]  folks that don't know like like me i mean i know what it is but not the i mean but i even get
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:38.600]  confused with other systems that are free or somewhat free and then we've got the brain
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:46.120]  computing interface points you want to make on that point and also you want to elaborate on a law
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:51.160]  that they've got to tell you about spy software that you're being forced to purchase that's been
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:56.840]  added onto the product that's washing machines it's in everything now let's let's hit that first
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:25:05.080]  and then get into canoe i don't know to what extent current things like washing machines
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:12.760]  have that uh surveillance capability in them uh it's a very important issue i've been trying
[02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:19.880]  for a few years to get people concerned about smart meters and their potential their gratuitous
[02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:28.360]  potential for surveillance because i'm pretty sure that most of the potential electric savings
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:35.800]  could be achieved if the system simply informs your computers about when are the times that
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:43.160]  electricity is particularly scarce and raises the price for that period of time and that way
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:52.600]  uh most people will choose to have their refrigerators not cool for that hour and they
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:59.160]  won't have to tell anybody that they're doing so they'll just use less electricity when it's
[02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:04.520]  expensive and they'll pay less sure well just to be clear then because i do focus on the consumers
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:09.560]  i know you're more into the deep guts of it all but i can give you more examples if you'd like but
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:17.080]  almost all the new washers dryers and the cihc he brags about this the new clock radios uh under
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:22.280]  mandates they're wired in with takeover switches to give you announcements they've got wireless
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:27.640]  systems that they admit are interfacing with the wireless meter readers uh california says oh yeah
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:33.640]  we are going to start dialing in and turning things down or off during power you know problems
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:39.960]  they shouldn't that for the legitimate goal which is to reduce the peak electricity demand
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:45.720]  there's no need to do the surveillance they could have somewhat different smart meter systems where
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:52.600]  they can't spy on you and they can't take control but they do cause you to pay more for electricity
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:59.960]  maybe even 10 times more they could uh when it's really in too high demand and most people would
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:07.640]  then voluntarily set their certain appliances not to run sure my point is is that sure but
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:13.000]  spying is gratuitous that's my point there's no need for the system to do spying the reason
[02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:20.200]  they're making it do spying is they want spying and the justifications they're giving are irrelevant
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:26.120]  they could achieve the legitimate justification without spying dr stahlman are you saying bin
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:33.400]  laudan is not hiding in a two-year-old's diaper well i don't know i mean it's conceivable that
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:38.600]  somebody might put a bomb in your old's diapers hey you know what there might be a bomb right now
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:43.720]  in your lower intestine we're gonna need to take you in for surgery right now but the point but
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:48.120]  that's a somewhat different issue you've got to recognize no but i'm being sarcastic it's all a
[02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:55.880]  giant power grab i'm concerned with the tsa is that they check for things other than bombs or weapons
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:01.240]  oh yeah now they're downloading people's laptops and cell phones as you just said yeah her point is
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:07.720]  that the tsa to make it i think that in order for the tsa to be constitutional they should not be
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:14.440]  allowed to take notice of anything other than a weapon that threatens the safety of the fight i
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:21.560]  disagree you're an extremist i think everyone should have proctology exams i'm being sarcastic
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:30.840]  dr yeah anyway you said i should tell people about gnu yes or tell us well what gnu is a well
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:38.600]  known question and the answer is gnu is not unix gnu is a recursive acronym it stands for gnu is
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:46.680]  not unix but what does that mean uh well basically gnu is an operating system it's an operating system
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:53.320]  designed to be entirely free software that is entirely software that the users control no
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:58.840]  software that controls the users and lots of people use gnu but they don't know it because
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:03.320]  they think that it's linux if you hear people talking about using linux well it's really the
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:09.160]  gnu system together with a program called linux that's which is one component of the system as
[02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:16.680]  we use it today so a fair name for this combination would be gnu plus linux the gnu contribution
[02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:22.920]  is bigger but we can share credit with mr torvald's also for the component linux which he wrote in
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:30.600]  1991 and two and so on so uh in fact lots of people use the gnu system i tell you what tell us more
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:36.600]  about gnu we got a long segment that was a short one dr stallman is our guest and i will control
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:42.280]  myself on tsa humor straight ahead i want to get into more on that and then the human brain interface
[02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:45.480]  what happens when they control the software in your brain and is it free
[02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:57.000]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:34:54.760 --> 02:35:00.920]  and gentlemen the awesome info wars.com camo shirts free bobber stickers citizen rule books with all
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:08.840]  orders info wars store.com or link through at prisonplanet.com or info wars.com okay that said
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:17.320]  going back to dr richardstallman gnu.org stallman.org let's move quick double we're having even better
[02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:22.840]  discussions during the breaks finish up on your point about you know what your software is and then
[02:35:22.840 --> 02:35:27.320]  you're explaining to me the semantical manipulations here why it's so important i tend to agree with
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:35.000]  you the overuse of the word free the conflating of the terms versus gratis or open explain that to us
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:40.520]  okay well first of all i almost finished with saying what gnu is it's an operating system many
[02:35:40.520 --> 02:35:46.760]  people call it linux which is really the name of one piece and there are many different distributions
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:54.280]  of gnu plus linux some of them are entirely free unfortunately most of them include some
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:36:01.720]  non-free software so i can't recommend them but you can find out more in gnu.org slash distros
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:06.840]  that's where we talk about which distros are free and which ones are not and why they're not
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:15.560]  in any case uh when i first started talking about free software in 1983 i wasn't aware of
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:22.280]  the confusion in my own ideas due to the two meanings of the word free after all free means
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:28.600]  zero price but it also means that you have freedom well after a few years i figured out i had to
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:36.520]  explicitly separate these two meanings so i started saying it's free as in freedom sometimes i say
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:44.760]  it's libre using a spanish word to that's clear but then a few years ago i also realized that
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:52.200]  whenever i want to talk about zero price to avoid confusion i should say gratis after all
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:58.280]  everyone knows gratis means zero price it's perfectly clear but this way whenever i say the
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:06.360]  word free it always refers to freedom and only freedom so this way at least in my own discourse
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:12.920]  i've got a word that refers to freedom unambiguously of course that's not everybody but you might
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:19.400]  want to follow this convention too now i'm not going to blame anybody for causing free to have
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:25.800]  these two meanings i'm sure that happened uh a few centuries yeah but explain what free
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:30.840]  software means it doesn't mean free and price necessarily it's not about price at all it means
[02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:37.480]  it respects the user's freedom and community and there are four specific essential freedoms that
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:44.440]  the users need in order to have control over the program they use freedom zero is the freedom to
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:51.480]  run the program as you wish freedom one is the freedom to study the source code and change it
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:57.400]  to make it do your computing the way you wish freedom two is the freedom to redistribute
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:03.080]  exact copies to others when you wish and freedom three is the freedom to distribute copies of
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:10.120]  your modified versions to others when you wish so the first two freedoms give us individual
[02:38:10.120 --> 02:38:17.080]  control one user individually and any user individually has control over the program
[02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:22.200]  that way but individual control is not enough partly because most users don't know how to program
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:27.960]  they don't know how to study and change source code but even if you know how you use so many
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:33.000]  programs you couldn't possibly have time to work on them all yourself even if you're a great programmer
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:38.920]  so we need to do this together we need collective control over the program and the four freedoms
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:43.960]  give us both individual control and collective control when I say collective control I mean
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:51.480]  that any group of users who want to use this one version and maintain it they can that those who
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:56.040]  know how to program will do the maintaining of it and the rest will just use it but they all get
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:39:01.560]  to choose whether to participate in that group and any group of people that choose to do this are
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:09.320]  free to do this people or organizations because they involve includes all the years so that's what
[02:39:09.320 --> 02:39:15.400]  free software means precisely it means that the users have freedom as they want and you've already
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:22.200]  basically defined the opposite of that which is this proprietary explain then what the confusion
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:30.760]  is when they use the word open well in 1998 there was a political disagreement within
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:36.360]  the free software community which had existed for many years there were those of us who thought of
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:41.960]  this in ethical terms as a fight for freedom people like me and then there were the people
[02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:48.440]  who appreciated the software and contributed to it but they only appreciated it for practical
[02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:55.640]  benefits and they didn't want to present this in terms of right and wrong and in 1998 they coined
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:02.760]  the term open source as a way to talk about the field and the software without ever saying
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:09.960]  free and nowadays if you look around you'll see that the term open source is usually associated
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:16.680]  with a purely practical approach to the issue one that's not idealistic one that doesn't raise it
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:21.320]  as an issue of justice versus injustice sure sure well we talked about this software moment
[02:40:21.320 --> 02:40:25.960]  sure we talked about this last time you were on you know i'm a multimedia operation to get my
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:31.960]  information which is more freedom out to people from my perspective and so many times we end up
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:39.320]  using free or the other softwares that they call open but a lot of times it is free because the other
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:45.560]  stuff it's offered by industry it's not just that it's more expensive it doesn't work because it's so
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:49.880]  chop-full of spy gadgets i mean i told you this example last time you want to send you some
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:55.720]  examples i told the guys too i don't know if they did they're so busy but when you buy televisions
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:03.240]  now or when you buy uh uh uh systems and we're trying to run our own video we've produced
[02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:09.560]  over these monitors we have to go through all sorts of justice justiculations because it's
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:14.920]  got copyright coding on it to try to stop things from playing over it unless it's already coded
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:19.400]  it's like what you don't think i'd ever play something that you know i produced over this the
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:27.880]  point is it's riddled with these little crud things and and and so if it wasn't for free
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:34.200]  software we wouldn't be able to get a lot of what we you know do done so i see all this proprietary
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:38.600]  stuff it'd be one thing they were selling proprietary software it's that they've gotten the rest of
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:46.520]  industry to put gates in everything to surveil things with prior restraint i disagree i think
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:53.640]  all proprietary software is an injustice and i won't touch it i won't take it well sure i mean
[02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:57.960]  you know more about than i do i'm just saying it it's horrible and it doesn't work and it
[02:41:57.960 --> 02:42:04.360]  surveils me preemptively saying i'm guilty forever not even guilty until privy innocent this is a
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:09.880]  consequence of the fact that it's proprietary you see with proprietary software the program
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:17.400]  controls the users and the owner controls the program so proprietary software is an instrument
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:25.240]  of unjust power and of course they are tempted to do nasty things to you once they have the power
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:32.120]  my point is that you recognize the nasty things that they do to you my point is that the evil
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:38.600]  starts with letting them have the power in the first place it it doesn't i agree so so what do we
[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:45.480]  do what do we do reject non-free software i'm serious but i'm saying it's in television sets
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:51.720]  we buy now i won't buy them i agree so what do you do though i don't have a cable setup because the
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:59.000]  cable box is full of proprietary software that they can upgrade and that it's designed to restrict you
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.080]  so i don't have cable here's the great example i told you about this last time it made the news
[02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:08.120]  they jessie ventura's tv show this one episode aired once they didn't want to air again and they
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:14.120]  later admitted it they went in with a computer and erased the show off people's dvrs they'd
[02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:19.160]  paid for the cable they'd paid for the dvr it's supposedly their property but they went in and
[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:25.400]  erased the show i didn't know about this i'd love to see an article about this i'll spread the word
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:31.480]  but yeah those dvrs are full of non-free malicious software it's designed to restrict people it has
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:38.040]  digital handcuffs and the reason but the point is people can easily see that the malicious features
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:45.240]  are in injustice my point is the injustice starts deeper down it starts when they get the power to
[02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:50.040]  control what the software does and what it all right i want to talk about cyborgs but what is
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:55.240]  your over you know this human brain ship interface that you've been researching and you give us your
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:44:01.640]  take on that but dr. stallman the general shape of the web cyber security internet censorship
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:08.280]  internet ids internet taxes clearly the power structure is moving towards a darkening web
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:14.680]  a do you agree with that b what's your overall view i agree we're moving towards a kind of
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:25.800]  information computing enabled tyranny a surveillance state that's worse than 1984
[02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:34.680]  or i often describe portable phones as Stalin's dream because Stalin would have loved to surveil
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:43.560]  people as much as portable phones do but he couldn't yeah it tracks everywhere you're going google
[02:44:43.560 --> 02:44:48.200]  admits they can because i don't have one they can they can track where you're they know what
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:52.760]  restaurants are looking up what movie you're gonna go see i mean it's literally like a guardian
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:59.240]  devil following around yes oh but of course that it's likely to be because you're looking it up in
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:05.160]  a google server and they just have to connect which phone it is with what search it's doing
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:12.760]  now when i do a search on the web which i do not terribly often but sometimes i do it in a way
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:19.480]  that can't be connected with me now there was how do you do that proxy servers uh well actually i
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:26.920]  use a shared computer which i log in on occasionally to do various such things but mostly they're used
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:35.720]  by other people so they can't be connected with me and uh and you know and i i have it the legal
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:41.960]  cookies at the end of the session so it can't track the long term that way i mean what i'm doing
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:48.920]  with those machines is not a particularly secret thing there's nothing still is just the exercise
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:52.680]  that i mean it's not particularly secret when i go and close the door and go to the bathroom but
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:57.640]  i don't want to live in a glass house exactly and and and and so you either exercise these
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:02.440]  rights or you lose them and the system wants to just tell us oh it's already happened you don't
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:07.400]  have any privacy so you know what we're gonna go ahead and just come in your house now without a
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:16.280]  warrant how's that sound yeah well jacob applebaum uh just uh had an interview published where he
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:23.560]  talks about the precautions that people take who really don't want to be spied on freedom campaigners
[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:32.840]  like him wow let's get into these uh brain chip interfaces i mean it's a it's a labyrinth of good
[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:40.280]  things but the problem is all of it being rolled out from day one is proprietary and run by these
[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:46.840]  these control freaks yeah well basically what the uh the recent study showing that they can get
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:54.520]  information about people by using these commercial brain computer interfaces demonstrates that if
[02:46:54.520 --> 02:47:00.840]  you use one you're placing a lot of trust in whatever software is running it and the only
[02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:08.600]  way software can deserve that kind of trust is if it's free software so uh this is yet another
[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:16.040]  example of how if you use non-free software you're a sucker and they're white yeah it's like watching
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:20.760]  mainstream television you're being brainwashed you're being given subliminals you're asking for it
[02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:25.320]  and uh i mean this is hacking the brain they're now saying they can go in and and use programs to
[02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:31.720]  grab data they're now putting passive MRIs and a few airports to passively scan us i mean this is
[02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:40.920]  crazy yeah well people have got to realize but uh perfect safety against any threat doesn't exist
[02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:48.680]  and that uh going to desperate lengths and sacrificing an essential freedom for a little
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:55.320]  bit more temporary security is a mistaken goal well it creates the great threat i've got to pull
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:48:00.280]  the eisenhower quote the president eisenhower said if you want safety go to prison of course
[02:48:00.280 --> 02:48:05.160]  you're not really even safe there he went on to add i mean the great threat is those that say give
[02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:13.720]  up your rights will protect you yep so is there any way to turn this around i don't know i mean i
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:18.920]  don't know anything i could do that would turn it around if i knew something i'd be doing it all i
[02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:26.600]  know how to do is try to spread the word and push wherever i get a chance you talk to i know a lot of
[02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:30.280]  you know fellow tech elites out there i know you want to be called that but you know you're
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:33.880]  highly respected i know you go to these conferences and things and rub shoulders
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:38.040]  now people like bill joy have said hey what we're building is dangerous 12 years ago and is
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:44.040]  wired magazine piece why the future doesn't need us uh i mean do the elites i think they're not
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:51.640]  going to get caught no you know i don't know that many people who would call themselves elite uh i
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:58.760]  tend to know activists not uh not okay but my question is what is the the establishment's
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:03.240]  got to know that the trap they've built they're going to end up falling into it this is not a good
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:09.960]  idea they probably just compartmentalize their lives that's my guess yeah no that's it yeah i've
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:15.880]  actually talked to rocket scientists billionaires and they they're like they're smart at one level
[02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:22.600]  but they don't get the bigger picture i'm afraid they don't in any case they probably have so many
[02:49:22.600 --> 02:49:28.920]  interests at stake in continuing down the path they're on that they prefer not to worry about
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:35.640]  how it might bite them someday yeah it's kind of like let them eat cake Marie Antoinette
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:42.760]  oh no i wouldn't think so i don't think that they're quite analogous but basically they're
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:49.400]  so concerned with what they know they have to do for success in their careers that they
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:56.760]  disregard how that might affect their own freedom down the line yeah but i mean i think that is kind
[02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:02.600]  of leads to the the the disconnect of Marie Antoinette where she didn't understand what the
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:07.480]  policies were doing outside the palace i do think the ruling class she was safe from them
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:14.280]  them barring a revolution she knew that she was never going to go hungry so she really didn't
[02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:20.600]  have to worry she was really going to be spared if there had not been a revolution that's not
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:27.160]  true for these people they may get spied on just as badly as you and i do but they don't think about
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:33.480]  that well well we've got a final segment with you doc what do you want to cover when we come
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:40.040]  back in this next little six minute segment oh gee beats me i can't think of it oh well there's the
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:47.080]  issue of that just recently came up the the false Bruce Willis rumor about how he was going to sue
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:53.960]  apple about letting someone inherit his collection of iTunes music and that's an important issue
[02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:59.080]  even oh yeah they're now saying you can't even pass on something that's on one of these platforms
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:03.640]  it's incredible stay there we'll be right back hello this is ty bowlinger author of the best-selling
[02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:10.200]  book cancer step outside the box i want you to know some very important information in 1985
[02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:15.240]  president ronald reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the white house at a time when
[02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:21.160]  only the president could obtain this world-class healer now 27 years later carnivore capsules are

[02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:29.800]  chemtrail program put at 5 million a year they say they want to add stuff to all the jet fuel to
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:34.280]  put particulate up to save us from global warming oh really that's what they're already doing covertly
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:41.320]  but now they got the big article up at infowars.com on a Reuters admitting the exact chemtrailing we
[02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:45.320]  claimed they were doing but saying they're planning it in the future with five billion dollars
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:52.600]  so amazing report there Dr. Richard Stallman stallman.org gnu.org is our guest here we got
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:58.040]  about five six minutes left we were talking during the break about you know how to use search engines
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:55:02.840]  without being tracked starpage.com I think it's pretty good but again it's not that you're bad
[02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:07.000]  it's that they're spying on you and creating an algorithm on you I mean do you go to just
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:11.240]  a psychologist randomly and tell them everything about you so they can share it with the government
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:14.760]  that's what's happening when you're on this they're using it for nefarious purposes
[02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:21.160]  but getting back to yeah this hoax that oh see Bruce Willis doesn't want his stuff willed
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:27.400]  and then and then Apple saying yeah you don't own the songs you paid for I mean and then everything's
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:34.280]  up on the cloud oh I've gone through this now sir people make claims that my voice is copyrighted
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:38.200]  now to erase my videos off YouTube but I've never signed a deal with anybody to say that
[02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:43.320]  and when I complained to YouTube they put a strike against our account for daring to complain
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:48.040]  and then now the guy that does the Transformers voice when he does interviews with school kids
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:53.000]  they knock the video down saying his voice is copyrighted when I have Joe Rogan on they take
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:56.920]  the videos down saying they're copyrighted even though Joe never agreed to any of that
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:56:03.320]  so I meant to ask you about all those points ah well I don't put anything on YouTube because
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:10.200]  I can't watch YouTube you see the YouTube site requires that you run non-free software one
[02:56:10.200 --> 02:56:14.520]  way or another it's I won't run the non-free software I can't see YouTube none of it what
[02:56:14.520 --> 02:56:19.720]  about I understand with you but I mean the fact that they can in the cloud erase all the books
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:26.840]  they want nice 84 they could erase your voice I mean this is really dangerous this makes you know
[02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:34.360]  Fahrenheit whatever it is you're burning the books yeah well I don't like to use the term
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:42.040]  the cloud because it's a nebulous term right now you're using it for one particular kind of service
[02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:47.800]  and I know what you mean but other people use the same term to mean other things and people
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:52.520]  don't realize that these are several different things being called by one name so I never use
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:56:58.280]  that term you're putting your stuff in somebody else's server under their rules right I agree and
[02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:03.000]  well that's what you're talking about and I think we shouldn't do that and I don't do that
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:11.640]  you know I have some recordings of music in digital form I don't store them in some service I have
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:19.640]  them on disks in usb's and that's the only place I'm gonna have them and the system admits they
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:24.280]  want to go to cloud to control us I mean this is a bad thing yes well but the point I don't want to
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:30.760]  use the term cloud but those services are a bad thing and it this Bruce Willis rumor might have
[02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:37.320]  been false in regard to Bruce Willis but it's true in regard to what's bad about iTunes you
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:42.360]  shouldn't use iTunes at all I mean you can't use iTunes unless you're using non-free software
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:47.640]  which you shouldn't use because you lose control of your computing so of course it's bad but then
[02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:56.760]  this just shows how once they've got this non-free software that they use that to exercise more
[02:57:56.760 --> 02:58:03.720]  control of you so you shouldn't let them get the first level of control over you and you shouldn't
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:13.000]  buy anything in digital form unless it gives you the same freedoms as a printed book or a CD or
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:22.440]  or an LP record if you look at stallman.org slash ebooks.pdf you'll see this issue for ebooks most
[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:29.560]  commercial ebooks are fundamentally unethical in three ways they're a digital handcuffs they
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:34.440]  make you sign a contract but so you don't get the same rights you would get if you bought a printed
[02:58:34.440 --> 02:58:39.480]  book and you can't buy them anonymously. Dr. Stallman thank you so much amazing job.

[02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:55.800]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[02:58:55.800 --> 02:59:02.120]  year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa
[02:59:02.120 --> 02:59:07.000]  fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:11.400]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy
[02:59:11.400 --> 02:59:16.600]  to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:21.320]  from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise
[02:59:21.320 --> 02:59:26.120]  prices too now is the time to get your supply i recently increased my supply from e-foods direct
[02:59:26.120 --> 02:59:30.760]  because we have all known this was coming you know about their delicious long-term storable foods
[02:59:30.760 --> 02:59:35.240]  the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it's stored for 25 years

[03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:24.920]  from the front lines if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:00:24.920 --> 03:00:31.960]  that's right and uh earlier in the broadcast it will be coming up in retransmission we had
[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:38.920]  new york times journalist a foreign editor middle east editor hold a surprise when our
[03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:44.360]  chris hedges on saying the ultimate tyranny is upon us we have dr richard stallman the creator
[03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:49.160]  of you know pretty much the free software movement gnu.org we're doing a little bit of
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:53.480]  overdrive with him right now sir you were trying to trying to finish up how we deal with
[03:00:53.480 --> 03:01:00.600]  the digital handcuffs you know how bad itunes is how bad it is that kindle last year as you
[03:01:00.600 --> 03:01:06.680]  know erased thousands of books that people paid for including 1984 and then now they've
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:12.840]  been caught in price fixing and things to try to bankrupt the print media that's why i've come out
[03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:17.960]  with a print once a month newspaper with our web stories and some exclusive stuff by the way folks
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:22.760]  we have a few extra copies of that they're almost sold out because we'd sold out but then we had
[03:01:22.760 --> 03:01:27.400]  about 3500 extra that hadn't been put on the streets we discovered in the warehouse that's
[03:01:27.400 --> 03:01:31.640]  that warehouse isn't here so that's available info or shop.com but they're almost all gone if you
[03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:37.720]  want that first september issue but uh going back to mr. stallman uh finishing up your point doctor
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:43.000]  about you know how to mitigate uh this tyranny and how to have a revolution against it because
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:47.640]  what you and others are doing from my layman perspective is one of the real revolutions
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:55.080]  against this technocracy so we salute you. Doing my best uh you were talking about the
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:02:01.560]  amazon swindle as i prefer to call it it was in 2009 that they deleted thousands of copies
[03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:07.320]  in 1984 and then they promised they would never do that again unless ordered to by the state
[03:02:08.200 --> 03:02:14.200]  so but in general the swindle takes away readers traditional freedoms for instance
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:19.320]  there's a freedom to buy a book anonymously which you could still do in a bookstore if you pay cash
[03:02:19.320 --> 03:02:24.760]  that's the only way i buy books i don't use a credit card uh and then there's the freedom to
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:29.880]  give a book to someone else after you read it or the to lend it to people after you read it
[03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:36.760]  or to sell it to someone else uh they take those away with digital handcuffs and then there's a
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:42.120]  freedom to keep the book as long as you wish which they took away with that backdoor well for
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:49.720]  any one of these reasons it's unacceptable and the competitors to the swindle are not quite as
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:57.160]  bad but they're still mostly as bad so they're no good either uh so they're in order for an e-book
[03:02:57.160 --> 03:03:03.960]  to be legitimate and ethical it has to be possible to buy it anonymously it must not
[03:03:04.520 --> 03:03:09.560]  make you sign any contract so that you get the same rights you would get with a printed book
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:17.640]  and it must not come in a secret format designed to make you you have to be able to share it so
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:22.280]  you just get a digital form that you can share because you bought it as your physical property
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:28.920]  yeah so the point is if you look at stallman.org slash ebooks.pdf you'll see my campaign
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:37.000]  for to make ebooks ethically acceptable but you raised a broader issue basically that of the
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  the technological police state and how what do we do about that well i don't know what to do about
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:53.880]  that uh except try in the areas where i see some opportunity and say no i have a lot of practice
[03:03:53.880 --> 03:04:03.960]  in saying no to things other people will do uh 20 years ago i didn't use my credit card very often
[03:04:03.960 --> 03:04:10.120]  but whenever it seemed convenient i would do it nowadays i just don't except for buying airline
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:16.680]  tickets because they know my name anyway the point is i'm saying no uh i never started to have a
[03:04:16.680 --> 03:04:22.760]  portable phone because the tracking bothered me but they want to take the airport model and expand
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:27.880]  it to uh face deals oh face but we only have 30 seconds face deals where they want a face
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:34.680]  scan you to buy and sell and they give you little discounts well i won't do it i don't use this supermarket
[03:04:34.680 --> 03:04:41.960]  loyalty cards now except once in a while i'll get someone else's number and i'm fine doing well amazing
