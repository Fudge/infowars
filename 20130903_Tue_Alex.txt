[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.840]  things are really developing quickly and I'm going to break down every angle and
[00:31.840 --> 00:37.920]  facet of the situation in Syria the establishment media and the government of
[00:37.920 --> 00:44.200]  the West governments of the West trying to sell this massive fraud the very
[00:44.200 --> 00:50.720]  jihadis that the West are backing tried to block the Suez Canal today and they've
[00:50.720 --> 00:55.160]  had to send an attack helicopters to take them out and our media is
[00:55.160 --> 01:01.600]  criticizing the Egyptian military for basically firing rockets from
[01:01.600 --> 01:10.600]  helicopters into actual al-Qaeda we are living in the twilight zone and literally
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.200]  thousands of military men mainly I haven't seen any women are holding up
[01:16.200 --> 01:20.800]  pieces of paper that say on them I didn't join the Marines I didn't join the
[01:20.800 --> 01:24.400]  army I didn't join the Navy I didn't join the Air Force spending on what
[01:24.400 --> 01:33.000]  service they're in to be on the side of al-Qaeda in Syria and the media is been
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.040]  spending it that well they're being traitors or that it's all fake just
[01:38.040 --> 01:44.120]  because the Syrian electronic army took the information and hacked in the
[01:44.120 --> 01:48.680]  Marine Corps website showing the info no I've run into military on the streets
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.800]  in the last two weeks twice because Austin Texas and Central Texas is
[01:53.800 --> 01:57.360]  crawling with military bases and it's just military bases all around us and
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.560]  they're all absolutely angry and upset about it anybody that has military
[02:02.560 --> 02:07.600]  family members knows this and this is a big deal the military has been fighting
[02:07.600 --> 02:15.700]  these jihadis for 12 years almost 12 years overseas and a lot of them have
[02:15.700 --> 02:20.280]  been wounded by them a lot of them have been injured by them a lot of them had
[02:20.280 --> 02:24.320]  lost friends to them and they're very very upset about it and they know the
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.800]  facts they know the US military in Jordan has been training al-Qaeda commandos
[02:29.800 --> 02:35.680]  for two and a half years plus by the way that's now mainstream news today gonna
[02:35.680 --> 02:39.240]  be getting to that I'm not tooting our horn it's just I mean all I do is study
[02:39.240 --> 02:43.680]  this stuff okay I know what I'm talking about more than it pretty much anybody
[02:43.680 --> 02:47.800]  else you're gonna hear does that mean that I get stuff wrong occasionally or
[02:47.800 --> 02:52.080]  get names mixed up sure the world's so complex folks I work on this full time
[02:52.080 --> 02:56.720]  and feel like I'm a complete buffoon I can't imagine being a member of the
[02:56.720 --> 03:01.960]  general public though that has no idea how anything works that must be really
[03:01.960 --> 03:07.520]  scary or I guess they say ignorance is bliss so I guess it isn't scary it's
[03:07.520 --> 03:13.960]  scary for me to realize that people been in the dark so much but now the sea
[03:13.960 --> 03:19.360]  change happened a week and a half ago the Reuters poll other polls 9 to 15
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.000]  percent supports what they've got depending on the poll for this attack
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.920]  and that's a total flip from the numbers that it was previously it is a
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.200]  collapse of confidence in the system and that's the big story here bigger than
[03:34.200 --> 03:38.280]  Syria bigger than all the ramifications of that even short term is this and
[03:38.280 --> 03:42.240]  we're going to go over to today Paul Watson has an article up on info wars
[03:42.240 --> 03:54.760]  dot com dealing with the fact that a top law professor who worked in the Bush
[03:54.760 --> 04:02.440]  administration in authorizations for war has come out and said in a law journal
[04:02.440 --> 04:08.400]  that Obama's Syrian attack resolution authorizes boots on the ground now
[04:08.400 --> 04:12.320]  separately there's a London telegraph article that our story links to with a
[04:12.320 --> 04:16.440]  former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying that they've talked to
[04:16.440 --> 04:21.000]  people on the hill this is a full-out invasion of course it is they don't have

[08:40.600 --> 08:47.160]  serious situation on so many fronts we're also going to look at 40,000 long
[08:47.160 --> 08:55.120] shoremen quit the AFL CIO over Obamacare and the open borders finally the unions
[08:55.120 --> 08:59.080]  wake up that they've been completely sold out we're going to be going over that
[08:59.080 --> 09:04.280]  Russia issues travel warning to its citizens abroad to not visit the US or
[09:04.280 --> 09:07.360]  countries that have extradition agreements because they say that you may
[09:07.360 --> 09:11.800]  just be kidnapped and disappeared that's like 30 years ago don't go to Russia you

[09:17.240 --> 09:22.400]  finding women dancing naked on stage and men filming sex acts well that's what
[09:22.400 --> 09:27.760]  secret societies are for I know people that have been in the Illuminati believe
[09:27.760 --> 09:32.080]  me it's a lot more serious than that I mean look look what goes on a bohemian
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.200]  Grove ladies and gentlemen so we're going to be talking about that report
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.560]  before I get into the seriousness I'm very excited about this we're going to
[09:41.560 --> 09:50.720]  be having Roderick George tombs or rowdy Piper coming on the broadcast with us
[09:50.720 --> 09:56.080]  ladies and gentlemen rowdy rowdy Piper of course the 25th anniversary of they
[09:56.080 --> 10:02.120]  live the seminal John Carpenter film that I am a huge fan of because it
[10:02.120 --> 10:07.440]  absolutely gets you outside the box and it's a great allegory of what's really
[10:07.440 --> 10:12.320]  happening and waking up from the matrix and seeing how incredibly obvious it
[10:12.320 --> 10:16.920]  was how did you not see before it's only the decision to look a little bit
[10:16.920 --> 10:24.480]  deeper and that is basically putting on the sunglasses so I'm told that he is a
[10:24.480 --> 10:31.160]  listener of the show and that he is into conspiracies and things again putting
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.360]  the glasses on and Sean Stone is going to be on with him frequent to
[10:35.360 --> 10:38.640]  contribute to the broadcast and I've also been involved with him with his
[10:38.640 --> 10:45.760]  national TV show with Ventura so Sean Stone obviously son of the older father
[10:45.760 --> 10:52.840]  director will be will be joining us coming up on the broadcast and also
[10:52.840 --> 10:58.240]  want to ask him about his dad Oliver Stone getting more hardcore in Japan two
[10:58.240 --> 11:03.480]  weeks ago and saying Obama is a quote snake and we've all got to turn on him
[11:03.480 --> 11:08.840]  so we'll play that clip as well when his son Oliver Stone director and writer
[11:08.840 --> 11:17.000]  and producer in his own right joins us as well ahead of Rowdy Roddy Piper joining
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.440]  us he'll grew up watching wrestling and watching Piper you know Saturday night
[11:23.440 --> 11:26.880]  whenever it came on for entertainment purposes but really I'm a big fan because
[11:26.880 --> 11:32.520]  if they live and some of the other other films that he's in so that is coming up
[11:32.520 --> 11:37.360]  we'll get his take on the world as well Wayne Madsen will join us in the first
[11:37.360 --> 11:43.140]  30 minutes of the next hour formerly in the Navy and anti-submarine warfare then
[11:43.140 --> 11:48.960]  in NSA internal security he's really the original NSA whistleblower the the
[11:48.960 --> 11:52.920]  granddaddy of them all in fact if he did the stuff what he did 15 years ago
[11:52.920 --> 11:56.840]  today he'd probably be in prison but he's going to join us because he's been to
[11:56.840 --> 12:02.080]  Syria and he's always got his ear to the ground working up there on Capitol Hill
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.600]  and reporting on national security matters so we'll get the inside scoop
[12:07.600 --> 12:14.000]  with Wayne Madsen coming up all right where to start on this serious
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.920]  situation not only is Syria obviously incredibly important geopolitically the
[12:21.920 --> 12:27.440]  energy prices to the name of the United States to the future of NATO to what's
[12:27.440 --> 12:32.600]  happening in Israel but it's also important that this is the first time
[12:32.600 --> 12:39.480]  since 1782 that the British Parliament has voted down a Prime Minister's
[12:39.480 --> 12:45.320]  request for authorization for war it is the first time in a very long time that
[12:45.320 --> 12:49.320]  the Turkish Parliament a big part of NATO has voted down an authorization of
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.780]  war that happened a few days ago and got almost no coverage here and it is the
[12:53.780 --> 13:01.440]  first time in recent memory that the Congress hasn't rushed to signal their
[13:01.440 --> 13:06.760]  support without even giving official authorization under the Constitution for
[13:06.760 --> 13:12.000]  the president el hefe the dear leader the dear one don't criticize him you'll
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.440]  get fired like the rodeo clown you don't do that in the new land of the free home
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.160]  of the brave it's the first time that the president said I'm going to strike I
[13:19.160 --> 13:23.920]  can do it if I want to I don't need your authorization just like with Libya a
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.720]  couple years ago now saying okay I do have to get your authorization but with
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.080]  his surrogates doubling back carry Secretary of State saying I can still
[13:33.080 --> 13:36.640]  you know he can still do this if Congress doesn't vote the right way and
[13:36.640 --> 13:45.000]  we've got John Boner I'm excuse me Boehner coming out and saying that he's
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.560]  going to authorize war let's get one thing straight there's been war going
[13:49.560 --> 13:56.800]  on for two years and nine months by Christmas time this year it'll be three
[13:56.800 --> 14:07.640]  years that cutter Saudi Arabia Jordan Turkey and several other Middle Eastern
[14:07.640 --> 14:17.920]  countries as well as NATO with CIA commandos MI6 commandos French commandos
[14:17.920 --> 14:21.960]  are one of the biggest forces there truly disgusting that they always claim
[14:21.960 --> 14:25.200]  they're anti-war and that are part of this I guess it is one country ganged up
[14:25.200 --> 14:28.160]  on all these people by the way the French folks are very angry about it
[14:28.160 --> 14:32.280]  they're almost 90% in polls against it as well but the socialist president in
[14:32.280 --> 14:36.040]  trouble for all his scandals caught the Swiss bank accounts with him and his
[14:36.040 --> 14:40.640]  party exempt from taxes basically when they raise a hundred percent plus tax
[14:40.640 --> 14:46.360]  on the middle class I'm not joking a 100 plus percent tax to absolutely bankrupt
[14:46.360 --> 14:50.280]  all their all their conservative and libertarian enemies to extinct them in
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.480]  the country the power to tax the power to destroy he wants a diversion Obama
[14:54.480 --> 15:00.160]  wants a bigger diversion there's a lot of factors at play here there are a lot
[15:00.160 --> 15:04.480]  of groups that can say well let's blame Israel or let's blame France or let's
[15:04.480 --> 15:12.760]  blame America or let's blame NATO you get wars when a whole bunch of different
[15:13.280 --> 15:20.240]  factions of the Western power structure line up when the stars align with Mars
[15:20.240 --> 15:28.080]  basically to use a astrology analogy that would make Nancy Reagan happy or
[15:28.080 --> 15:33.080]  use an astronomical as well be more scientific when the stars align in the
[15:33.080 --> 15:38.760]  house of Mars you get big hot wars but let's get this straight it's come out in
[15:38.760 --> 15:43.160]  the foreign press I have military sources who two years ago told me they
[15:43.160 --> 15:47.800]  were considering retiring early out of the military people that have been over
[15:47.800 --> 15:52.840]  20 years and leaving the United States because they're so disgusted and freaked
[15:52.840 --> 15:57.480]  out by the open training to take on the American people that's now all public the
[15:57.480 --> 16:01.680]  FEMA camps the gun confiscation the armored vehicles the bullets the Army
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.520]  times stars and stripes all admitting the preparations for war domestically
[16:05.520 --> 16:12.160]  against libertarians returning veterans gun owners Christians this is all now
[16:12.160 --> 16:15.520]  past day it's all over the news well of course we're trying to take you on you're
[16:15.520 --> 16:19.800]  the main terror threat they're just normalizing it ahead of actually trying
[16:19.800 --> 16:23.680]  to do it when they finally they build this stuff in secret they train in
[16:23.680 --> 16:28.040]  secret but then when they started openly announcing it you on the news
[16:28.040 --> 16:32.080]  saying will arrest you if you talk bad about Obama we've played those news
[16:32.080 --> 16:36.080]  clips the truth squats that's when they're really trying to acclimate and
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.920]  hide it in plain view so the police and military and others and judges all kind
[16:40.920 --> 16:47.280]  of follow the the herd that the the tyrannical train here they all get
[16:47.280 --> 16:52.040]  hooked up to it and just play ball the message is going out it's also a form of
[16:52.040 --> 16:57.960]  intimidation that yeah okay we are we are training to put you in camps we are
[16:57.960 --> 17:02.680]  training to take your guns what you gonna do about it so the military is all
[17:02.680 --> 17:07.520]  completely freaking out about this and they're also freaked out the cherry on
[17:07.520 --> 17:15.040]  top is that at bases in Jordan in bases in Iraq I forgot Iraq and Turkey and all
[17:15.040 --> 17:21.120]  over surrounding this this poor country Syria they are injecting jihadis who
[17:21.120 --> 17:26.600]  shoot up convoys of cars on the highway because if you haven't joined them they
[17:26.600 --> 17:31.800]  kill you they killed 40-something men women and children just today and then
[17:31.800 --> 17:36.440]  pose with the dead bodies they're attacking the Suez Canal and military

[24:22.600 --> 24:27.280]  joining us I want to give the number out again for active-duty military
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.920]  personnel to call in there are literally hundreds and hundreds earlier in the
[24:32.920 --> 24:37.480]  weekend now thousands so many we can't track them of military personnel mainly
[24:37.480 --> 24:42.720]  officers non-commissioned but also I see some of the photos are colonels and
[24:42.720 --> 24:47.800]  captains and others wearing the uniforms but covering up their face with a piece
[24:47.800 --> 24:53.280]  of paper saying I didn't join the army to fight for al-Qaeda in a Syrian civil
[24:53.280 --> 24:59.040]  war and you know to call it a civil war is not even really accurate the Assad
[24:59.040 --> 25:05.800]  father was brutal and did crush some of the Sunni radicals that were openly
[25:05.800 --> 25:12.280]  trying to take over the country and I don't want to live in Syria I don't live
[25:12.280 --> 25:17.880]  in the Middle East I don't have a dog in this fight but his son was democratizing
[25:17.880 --> 25:22.800]  opening things up at dinner with Kerry five times was hanging out with the West
[25:22.800 --> 25:28.160]  was trying to make deals with Israel and now they have used the fact that they
[25:28.160 --> 25:33.640]  opened their country up in almost the last three years two years nine months to
[25:33.640 --> 25:38.040]  inject all these forces into the country now if you go up to info wars comm
[25:38.040 --> 25:49.160]  there's an article up there dealing with Assad's meeting with Kerry one of five
[25:49.160 --> 25:53.200]  that he had but if you scroll down through the article we have Qaddafi and
[25:53.200 --> 25:59.800]  Saddam and others meeting with Obama and Rumsfeld and all the rest of them and
[25:59.800 --> 26:05.640]  how they always sucker these people in they got Qaddafi eight years ago to
[26:05.640 --> 26:09.280]  invest most his money with the West to open up all the investment to let Western
[26:09.280 --> 26:14.480]  governments come in he said oh I like Bush now oh I like Obama now they're my
[26:14.480 --> 26:20.120]  friends and they use that to absolutely suckering in fact it's come out the
[26:20.120 --> 26:24.320]  Tony Blair and Sarkozy actually got a lot of the investment money directly
[26:24.320 --> 26:29.680]  from Qaddafi and then their answer was to set him up and killing and then you
[26:29.680 --> 26:34.960]  could say well Qaddafi's a bad guy really compared to Al Qaeda I mean they
[26:34.960 --> 26:39.040]  claim he blew up an airliner over Lockerbie Scotland turned out that really
[26:39.040 --> 26:45.280]  wasn't true early on yeah he did try to fund rebel groups in the Middle East I
[26:45.280 --> 26:51.240]  don't live in North Africa but the point is compared to the jihadis who were
[26:51.240 --> 26:55.800]  destabilizing everything he's a great guy just like Assad could be compared to
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.400]  them a great guy it's like you know saying Nixon's a great guy compared to
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.320]  Hitler or Jimmy Carter's a great guy compared to Stalin I mean it doesn't
[27:04.320 --> 27:09.480]  mean I want to be under Nixon or Jimmy Carter either and so you've got all
[27:09.480 --> 27:13.480]  this going on in the military comes out and says we don't like this and they're
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.920]  on record saying that you've had Dempsey the chairman of the Joint Chief say
[27:16.920 --> 27:21.480]  last year and this year don't attack Syria it could start a wider war that
[27:21.480 --> 27:25.480]  could lead to World War three you've got the British members of the Defense
[27:25.480 --> 27:28.720]  Ministry coming out you've got their parliament voting against it but the
[27:28.720 --> 27:34.960]  media comes out and says it's a hoax no military are putting these photos out
[27:34.960 --> 27:39.760]  that the Syrian government's behind it the only truth in that is a kernel of
[27:39.760 --> 27:46.200]  truth the Syrian electronic army which is really a bunch of hackers worldwide
[27:46.200 --> 27:50.080]  it's not even the Syrians people that are upset seeing this country get ganged up
[27:50.080 --> 27:53.960]  on they took the photos and kind of put it out as a tongue-in-cheek saying
[27:53.960 --> 27:59.880]  Marines Army join the Syrian military against Al Qaeda and so the only truth
[27:59.880 --> 28:05.320]  than it is is that the Marine website Marine Corps website was hacked yesterday
[28:05.320 --> 28:10.240]  or I guess Saturday no no be Sunday now but then Monday the news broke hacked
[28:10.240 --> 28:18.320]  with that information but this is real military that's against this so I thought
[28:18.320 --> 28:22.720]  we'd open the phones up for active duty or folks that have just recently got out
[28:22.720 --> 28:26.920]  your take on this I know you can't talk about it because it's it's classified
[28:26.920 --> 28:33.360]  but now it's not classified because Obama is telling Senators Graham and
[28:33.360 --> 28:38.800]  McCain and others don't worry I'm sending in the first teams of CIA
[28:38.800 --> 28:47.200]  trained jihadis these are not the first teams they have sent over 150,000 some
[28:47.200 --> 28:50.000]  some numbers are higher than that in the last two and a half years of the
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.120]  country and and where did I tell you they were mainly coming out of Jordan
[28:53.120 --> 28:57.560]  Jordan the US military increased its forces there a few months ago with a
[28:57.560 --> 29:04.320]  drill an exercise and never left mr. Obama said a 50 man's cell this is from
[29:04.320 --> 29:08.720]  the New York Times believed to have been trained by US special forces in Jordan
[29:08.720 --> 29:12.240]  was making its way across the border to Syria according to the New York Times
[29:12.240 --> 29:18.320]  ladies and gentlemen I thought you were told and that we were all told that it
[29:18.320 --> 29:22.080]  was only going to be some limited bombing there was no boots on the ground
[29:22.080 --> 29:26.920]  because of a chemical attack to help protesters who were chemical attack
[29:26.920 --> 29:32.600]  they're not protesters see it's all a giant line they've had special forces
[29:32.600 --> 29:42.560]  training al-Qaeda and others for years ladies and gentlemen years and years and
[29:42.560 --> 29:48.800]  now they just want to make the war public to shell you on an open air bombardment

[33:17.120 --> 33:33.560]  GCN radio network ladies and gentlemen we are back live and I again want to give
[33:33.560 --> 33:38.800]  the number out for active current serving military Obama is now bragging of
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.160]  what a tough guy he is that he doesn't need congressional authorization even
[33:43.160 --> 33:48.080]  though he admits he wants it the truth is under law he does need it they've
[33:48.080 --> 33:53.440]  always been attacking in the last two and a half years Syria they now just
[33:53.440 --> 33:57.880]  want to escalate the whole war and so now Obama wants to look like he can pull
[33:57.880 --> 34:02.640]  the punches you know he can throw the punches he can do whatever he wants
[34:02.640 --> 34:08.760]  regardless of what Congress does so he's bragging about the CIA and the
[34:08.760 --> 34:14.840]  commandos they're sending in well that's what they have they have CIA sheep
[34:14.840 --> 34:19.800]  dipped former special forces is what they are most of them contractors so they
[34:19.800 --> 34:30.680]  get killed they can deny they were ever there and they send them in to Syria to
[34:30.680 --> 34:36.120]  engage in every form of mass murder you can imagine blowing up churches
[34:36.120 --> 34:41.400]  poisoning water supplies shooting up convoys of cars driving down highways
[34:41.400 --> 34:48.480]  lazing military targets so they can be fired upon with different types of
[34:48.480 --> 34:54.280]  ground-to-ground missiles ground-to-air missiles it is just an orgy of jihadi
[34:54.280 --> 35:03.360]  behavior I know we've talked a lot about that but now the Pentagon is coming
[35:03.360 --> 35:11.640]  out and basically now saying that that they do think it can be successful in
[35:11.640 --> 35:15.480]  an air bombardment of Assad because they're being ordered to say that by
[35:15.480 --> 35:21.400]  the people that control Obama so I want to get your take out there if you're
[35:21.400 --> 35:27.560]  active duty what do you think of the story we have up on info wars calm where
[35:27.560 --> 35:33.840]  the news media and the White House is saying that none of the military is
[35:33.840 --> 35:38.680]  upset about fighting with al-qaeda that it's all a hoax even though many of
[35:38.680 --> 35:45.200]  these people that are posting their photos active duty people that are
[35:45.200 --> 35:51.480]  posting photos with whiteboards in front of their faces saying I joined the
[35:51.480 --> 35:55.760]  military to fight for my country's freedom not to support al-qaeda in a
[35:55.760 --> 36:01.040]  Syrian civil war I serve America and all its people not terrorist please wake
[36:01.040 --> 36:05.160]  up America by the way a lot of these people are posting it to their
[36:05.160 --> 36:11.800]  official Facebook's and to their official Twitter's and if you go to real
[36:11.800 --> 36:19.360]  Alex Jones on Twitter we've put up a link with the hashtag so that you can
[36:19.360 --> 36:28.960]  tweet at real Alex Jones your photos and your statements of where you stand on
[36:28.960 --> 36:34.480]  ganging up with the whole West against one little country to go in and commit
[36:34.480 --> 36:39.680]  absolute mass murder and to put the country under Sharia law and to
[36:39.680 --> 36:45.040]  persecute Christians I mean this is really incredible and and and to see
[36:45.040 --> 36:51.160]  Lindsey Graham and other neocons out there cheerleading this and giving
[36:51.160 --> 36:56.040]  Obama right cover prodding him saying how dare you don't you know take action
[36:56.040 --> 37:00.280]  against Assad when he gasses on people when it's been admitted they can't
[37:00.280 --> 37:06.080]  prove Assad did it and Pat Buchanan and Ron Paul and Rand Paul and yours truly
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.040]  and countless others have said there's video of the rebels firing at the rebels
[37:11.040 --> 37:15.600]  have done it before and been caught it's in the Turkish news that's anti Syria
[37:15.600 --> 37:21.760]  anti Assad going back six months ago in the big Turkish newspapers I've got it
[37:21.760 --> 37:30.920]  here on the stack I'm gonna go over it it's in the Turkish news that they caught
[37:30.920 --> 37:36.200]  Syrian rebels al Qaeda rebels sneaking back into Turkey with chemical weapons
[37:36.200 --> 37:43.640]  six months ago but in February almost seven months ago
[37:44.160 --> 37:49.800]  I mean anybody who actually studies just even mainstream media because this
[37:49.800 --> 37:54.600]  stuff's all buried in the news knows about this even the control press can't
[37:54.600 --> 38:00.760]  hide this stuff they just try to say it's no big deal so the issue is the whole
[38:00.760 --> 38:04.680]  false flag narrative has imploded and they may even go ahead with the
[38:04.680 --> 38:11.960]  bombardment they may be able in other six months to actually kick Assad out but
[38:11.960 --> 38:15.960]  what are they going to do then when the world watches al Qaeda put the country
[38:15.960 --> 38:20.080]  under Sharia law sexually mutilate all the young girls kick the women out of
[38:20.080 --> 38:27.560]  college but burkas on their heads what is the world gonna do in two years if the
[38:27.560 --> 38:31.960]  West is able to kick Assad out when we're having to bomb the al Qaeda who was
[38:31.960 --> 38:37.240]  put in it's then time to have indictments of Obama and the other war
[38:37.240 --> 38:43.000]  criminals that did this this is a war crime this is starting a proxy war in a
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.040]  country that's done nothing to anybody lying about it there it is Syrian
[38:49.040 --> 38:54.440]  rebels were caught sneaking sarin gas across the border in May that was
[38:54.440 --> 38:57.240]  another case of it then if you actually click on the article it goes the
[38:57.240 --> 39:01.480]  Turkish newspaper I have the Turkish newspaper here in my stack I'll dig it
[39:01.480 --> 39:08.920]  out here in a moment it's just this is so mind-blowing to see this going on and
[39:08.920 --> 39:15.320]  so I want to hear from the military here's the toll-free number 800 259 92
[39:15.320 --> 39:29.080]  31 800 259 92 31 and we will get you up and on the air 800 259 92 31 and again
[39:29.080 --> 39:35.240]  you can also tweet your photos your comments where you stand to real Alex
[39:35.240 --> 39:40.760]  Jones at real Alex Jones and we'll also dig up and show on screen the hashtag
[39:40.760 --> 39:48.280]  from earlier today where there it is calling on all active-duty military to
[39:48.280 --> 39:57.160]  tweet hashtag I didn't join images to at real Alex Jones to oppose Obama's
[39:57.160 --> 40:01.800]  attack on Syria and and we've opened the phones up to Israelis they've called in
[40:01.800 --> 40:05.880]  and said yeah we know that the Assad regime doesn't really like us but they're
[40:05.880 --> 40:10.560]  not attacking us I mean we know these al-Qaeda people hate us even more yeah
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.480]  this is a bad idea then some of the media tries to spin that you're anti-Israel
[40:15.480 --> 40:22.040]  if you don't want to take down Assad I'm not anti-Israel I get criticized more
[40:22.040 --> 40:28.320]  than probably anybody else by all the Israel haters for not being anti-Israel
[40:28.320 --> 40:33.320]  but I don't support corrupt elements in Israel that are doing bad things just
[40:33.320 --> 40:38.040]  like I don't support corrupt elements in France or Japan or China or England I
[40:38.040 --> 40:48.760]  want to be above it I want to be able to show how geopolitically the globalists
[40:48.760 --> 40:52.560]  are playing all these groups off against each other to bring nations into
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.960]  further debt to create more crises so they can bring in a global police state
[40:56.960 --> 41:07.600]  as the supposed answer 800 259 92 31 but the bottom line here is the jig is up
[41:07.600 --> 41:12.280]  the facade is dropping the blinders are coming off people the scales are being
[41:12.280 --> 41:18.960]  lifted the train left the station the genies out of the bottle the people of
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.440]  the world more and more are awakened aware as Brzezinski said two years ago
[41:23.440 --> 41:29.080]  to the CFR on TV he said the people are awake he wrote in his book that came out
[41:29.080 --> 41:34.960]  this year you can pull up the quote where he said in the past it was easier
[41:34.960 --> 41:39.800]  to spend a million dollars to propagandize a group of people now it's
[41:39.800 --> 41:43.400]  just cheaper to kill a million people than to propagandize a million people
[41:43.400 --> 41:48.200]  I'm paraphrasing can you guys pull up Brzezinski quote on it's cheaper to kill
[41:48.200 --> 41:51.440]  a million people and I'll give the actual quote he wrote this in his book I
[41:51.440 --> 41:56.720]  went and bought it I actually scanned it I didn't read it all I went to the went
[41:56.720 --> 42:00.120]  to the bibliography and then probably read 50 pages out of it just to check the
[42:00.120 --> 42:04.440]  quotes I saw online and he was talking I think it's like the five major threats
[42:04.440 --> 42:12.680]  that the world faces I forget the name of it but the point is is that when I
[42:12.680 --> 42:16.160]  went to buy it it was a guy in Barnes and Noble that it pulled out reading it
[42:16.160 --> 42:20.640]  looked like a retired CIA type guy thought he was real smart thought he was
[42:20.640 --> 42:24.040]  cooler than everybody else and I went over and I started getting the same book
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.560]  and he goes oh Brzezinski he knew I was and I said yeah he's a real criminal
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.240]  and I goes oh really why do you say that like I wouldn't know anything I said
[42:33.240 --> 42:40.160]  well he admitted that he got Carter to fund pole pond so that he could kill
[42:40.160 --> 42:45.280]  30% of the population and he also admits he's you know created al-Qaeda and
[42:45.280 --> 42:49.240]  divide and conquer and the guy was like well so what that's how you get things
[42:49.240 --> 42:53.800]  done I went what everybody you're not on the winning team you're just being used
[42:53.800 --> 42:57.600]  as well and laughed at him he wouldn't he wouldn't laughing anymore when I left
[42:57.600 --> 43:03.120]  let me tell you but anyways I just just remembered that story you don't often
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.000]  walk into a store find where the books are in the public affairs or political
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.480]  science section you go over there and there it is to put it bluntly in
[43:11.480 --> 43:15.640]  earlier times it was easier to control 1 million people than to physically kill
[43:15.640 --> 43:20.760]  1 million people today it is infinitely easier to kill 1 million people than to
[43:20.760 --> 43:27.040]  control 1 million people. Brzezinski from his new bookie-wookie the
[43:27.040 --> 43:32.760]  point is is that he's upset he came out last week on Thursday and said quote the
[43:32.760 --> 43:38.720]  alternative media is absolutely derailing our operations in Syria and
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.560]  that we're not doing this now anymore in the dark everyone's watching us as soon
[43:44.560 --> 43:48.880]  as the public figures out how exciting it is to become aware of geopolitical
[43:48.880 --> 43:52.200]  systems and how the world works and all the different fact toys and all the
[43:52.200 --> 43:57.080]  players now you're not concerned about the Dallas Cowboys versus the Pittsburgh
[43:57.080 --> 44:02.880]  Steelers you're not worried about the Miami Heat versus the LA Lakers you're
[44:02.880 --> 44:09.920]  not worried about how many pounds some movie star has lost or who our new
[44:09.920 --> 44:14.480]  boyfriend is it's like a joke once you wake up to eat people even care about
[44:14.480 --> 44:19.520]  that stuff it's only useful to interview celebrities to then reach out to their
[44:19.520 --> 44:24.200]  fan base who are in the Matrix and then they're already interesting celebrities
[44:24.200 --> 44:29.720]  because they're awake so it's fun to talk to them but other than that it's it
[44:29.720 --> 44:35.080]  it means nothing it means nothing the minute people learn how to set a
[44:35.080 --> 44:41.280]  learning baseball scores to learn about different mortar delivery systems or
[44:41.280 --> 44:47.720]  different nanotech micro plasms being put in the vaccines or do you know did
[44:47.720 --> 44:51.240]  it once you get into studying what the technocrats study but from the
[44:51.240 --> 44:56.800]  perspective of liberty you will never care about LeBron James again I will
[44:56.800 --> 45:02.760]  assure you you won't be able to help yourself I mean I can go to a party
[45:02.760 --> 45:05.740]  where there's a football game on and kind of get into the game if it's a good
[45:05.740 --> 45:11.840]  game close and yeah hey teams winning I mean I but it's still like I've dressed
[45:11.840 --> 45:16.120]  up in a Batman cape and I'm playing Batman and Robin with my son when he was
[45:16.120 --> 45:20.240]  five you know I mean I did that I ran around the yard ran around the house as
[45:20.240 --> 45:23.720]  Batman on my kids chasing me but you still feel a little goofy when the
[45:23.720 --> 45:27.600]  neighbor looks over and you wave at him and you're in a Batman outfit you know
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.360]  I put on a cape and a Batman outfit and the neighbors like hi Bob how you doing
[45:32.360 --> 45:36.680]  is like hey Alex how you doing up playing with playing with the playing with
[45:36.680 --> 45:42.040]  Rex here I mean I can go watch a football game but it's kind of like go

[45:45.920 --> 45:49.560]  watching you watching how pathetic everybody is with glassy looks in their
[45:49.560 --> 45:52.920]  eyes their whole tribalism that's meant to defend their family and their
[45:52.920 --> 45:57.400]  culture now shunted off into this whole sick game I said I'd go to your calls
[45:57.400 --> 46:03.680]  didn't I we're gonna go to Dan Tyler doc and others who are active duty
[46:03.680 --> 46:08.920]  military and inactive reserve and others who want to give us their tag but
[46:08.920 --> 46:13.880]  let me just briefly give you some of the headlines document can please you as
[46:13.880 --> 46:18.000]  the general says Syria action could be more substantial than thought gee really
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.320]  it's it's always been to topple the regime Obama's lying when he says it's
[46:21.320 --> 46:25.960]  to stop chemical weapons I mean how ridiculous it's just totally illegal to
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.440]  go do this preemptively so they lie and of course they know they're lying they
[46:30.440 --> 46:33.280]  know they're lying to you and everyone in the military knows it's a lie they
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.280]  treat you like your total idiots Obama's Syria attack resolution authorizes
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.800]  boots on the ground boom first Syrian rebels armed and trained by CIA on the
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.400]  way to the battlefield Bush administration lawyer Obama is asking
[46:47.400 --> 46:54.200]  Congress for authority to attack anyone on earth forever Israel claims joint US
[46:54.200 --> 46:58.520]  missile launch in Mediterranean for target practice no it was unannounced to
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.040]  trick the Russians they wanted to or somebody to fire their own missiles I
[47:02.040 --> 47:05.400]  mean they're not playing games folks they want a big war they want it now they
[47:05.400 --> 47:09.000]  just don't want to get in trouble later for starting it and that's what the top
[47:09.000 --> 47:12.560]  former member of the Joint Chiefs is saying about Obama right now in the
[47:12.560 --> 47:16.280]  New York Times Twitter flooded with active duty military and veterans
[47:16.280 --> 47:21.200]  opposing attack on Syria that's up on info wars.com MSM claims military
[47:21.200 --> 47:25.360]  revolt against Obama a hoax Watson's article proves these are real people on
[47:25.360 --> 47:34.700]  their official Facebooks continuing politicians in raids that Britain gave
[47:34.700 --> 47:38.960]  export license to sell Syria nerve gas chemicals turns out the nerve gas
[47:38.960 --> 47:44.600]  chemicals were fluoride used in industrial purposes the same stuff they

[48:01.800 --> 48:05.960]  and beer it's if you gave kids a glass of water you you were you were giving
[48:05.960 --> 48:10.400]  them beer it's ridiculous but but it is a chemical weapon and the final
[48:10.400 --> 48:17.360]  equation that they put in our water al Qaeda militants kill 24 civilians machine
[48:17.360 --> 48:22.240]  gun their vehicles and now the number's up to 40. Syria and geopolitics of oil

[48:55.880 --> 49:02.120]  helicopters and our media decries it as attacking protesters that is just some
[49:02.120 --> 49:06.160]  of the news on that front rocket kills 15 million militants and Sinai
[49:06.160 --> 49:11.920]  Egyptian State TV US feels tension by deploying warships near Syria says

[49:32.480 --> 49:36.500]  in telegraph this is the total technocratic control grid that's coming
[49:36.500 --> 49:42.240]  in dan in new york current military what service are you in dan and what do
[49:42.240 --> 49:48.720]  you think about the West arming al Qaeda hello yes sir yeah what do I think
[49:48.720 --> 49:56.040]  about almond al Qaeda first of all let's look back to September 11 2001 with
[49:56.040 --> 50:00.480]  the World Trade Center we all know you know and you've advocated itself that
[50:00.480 --> 50:06.680]  it was an inside job to say that we are now supporting them was to say we
[50:06.680 --> 50:10.440]  supported them to take down the powers themselves is that right or is that
[50:10.440 --> 50:15.480]  right not right well when I say inside job this is an important question there
[50:15.480 --> 50:18.640]  was definitely prior knowledge that was definitely nor at stand downs the
[50:18.640 --> 50:24.320]  supposed hijackers were dual trained at US bases on record Muhammad out of all
[50:24.320 --> 50:26.680]  of them I've interviewed the head of the embassy they were ordered to let them
[50:26.680 --> 50:31.120]  back in to the US nine months before 9-11 they were told these guys are
[50:31.120 --> 50:38.480]  really CIA they were CIA guys set up we don't know exactly what happened we just
[50:38.480 --> 50:44.000]  know the official story is inaccurate so when I say inside job they used it to
[50:44.000 --> 50:47.880]  take our liberties and now they say homeland securities for veterans gun
[50:47.880 --> 50:53.120]  owners conservatives libertarians as I warned 11 years ago they've now done it

[54:09.920 --> 54:15.520]  support funding al-qaeda and they admit it's al-qaeda it's a big deal that we
[54:15.520 --> 54:21.800]  forced this point out after two and a half years of hammering this that that
[54:21.800 --> 54:25.920]  now there's a global discussion about the people that run our country running
[54:25.920 --> 54:31.040]  al-qaeda to a great extent and then when they're in another country like
[54:31.040 --> 54:35.440]  Afghanistan fighting people that just don't want us there they then call them
[54:35.440 --> 54:41.600]  al-qaeda but then when it's real al-qaeda they're actually funding them it's
[54:41.600 --> 54:46.160]  absolutely incredible let's talk to doc in Delaware who says he's military what
[54:46.160 --> 54:53.120]  branch of the services are you answer let's go to doc now can we punch doc up
[54:53.120 --> 54:59.320]  guys doc I'm go ahead former and I'm former and I have current access to
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.600]  speck up guys and Intel guys that have been calling me almost non-stop over
[55:03.600 --> 55:07.800]  last three or four days I want to start the conversation by three points about
[55:07.800 --> 55:12.560]  bin Laden and the family that's in the public record first of all within the
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.600]  first 48 hours after the attack the bin Laden family was allowed to flee the
[55:16.600 --> 55:21.280]  country on Saudi airliners and they were never interrogated by the FBI in the
[55:21.280 --> 55:26.160]  public record mainstream media second point mainstream media there is
[55:26.160 --> 55:30.480]  currently an Arabic studies chair of Harvard University funded by a bin
[55:30.480 --> 55:34.840]  Laden family foundation third point in Colonel kick shapers book army
[55:34.840 --> 55:39.320]  intelligence track out up to a resident in Brooklyn that had him under 24 hours
[55:39.320 --> 55:43.480]  surveillance but of course the book was mostly redacted the information I'm
[55:43.480 --> 55:47.640]  getting is that the attack these attacks are being done by Saudi
[55:47.640 --> 55:51.640]  intelligence at our behalf and that they're buying the sarin on the black
[55:51.640 --> 55:58.200]  market well yes sir and then the jihadis are so badly coordinated that they
[55:58.200 --> 56:02.400]  shoot videos bragging while they launch the chemical attacks and the Turks
[56:02.400 --> 56:09.200]  caught them earlier this year twice now that's in the Turkish newspapers why
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.840]  would be I'm a decent work but I face that I'm mostly slavic background here's
[56:12.840 --> 56:17.840]  what I'm against this whole thing there are videos on YouTube of these rebel
[56:17.840 --> 56:21.800]  clowns parading our nuns through the streets with their hands up like
[56:21.800 --> 56:26.880]  prisoners with AK-47 that they're back there are also videos on YouTube of
[56:26.880 --> 56:32.720]  these these rebel clowns beheading our orthodox priests in the street as far as
[56:32.720 --> 56:37.520]  I'm concerned these rebels rebels are filled and I do not care what a thought
[56:37.520 --> 56:40.880]  does with them or the Russians do with them they're dogs and they should die
[56:40.880 --> 56:45.640]  like dogs well that's what all my military sources are saying but the
[56:45.640 --> 56:51.080]  White House responds by saying you're a fake caller you don't exist as active
[56:51.080 --> 56:55.720]  military but everybody I talked to doc says the same thing you're saying let
[56:55.720 --> 56:59.160]  me ask you this question when you talk to other members the military what
[56:59.160 --> 57:07.280]  percentage are upset about this 80% 90% on up yeah that's what I'm getting the
[57:07.280 --> 57:11.000]  people the people that I know they're there are true spec ops and true vets
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.960]  and an ex either State Department DIA or CAA guys including older guys for the
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.760]  Cold War they've said to me that this has false flag written all over it to a
[57:21.760 --> 57:28.400]  man well yeah it's they caught him red-handed doing it I wonder why they
[57:28.400 --> 57:33.080]  why they don't seem to care and aren't even upset that their own jihadis are
[57:33.080 --> 57:38.200]  on video loading the chemical mortars well you see Putin had a secret project
[57:38.200 --> 57:43.720]  okay Yeltsin Yeltsin was given stuff away from rides Yeltsin appointed Putin
[57:43.720 --> 57:49.040]  because Clinton's excuse me screwed the Russians Putin was was young successor
[57:49.040 --> 57:55.040]  at Yeltsin's choice Putin had a secret project run by the FSP which is a
[57:55.040 --> 58:02.520]  successor to the KGB Putin either by hook or by crook bought back all ALL that
[58:02.520 --> 58:08.160]  he could find of any nuclear nuclear backpack backpack bombs and any nerve
[58:08.160 --> 58:12.440]  agents or chemical agents that had a state the former Soviet Union he brought
[58:12.440 --> 58:17.080]  them back inside of Russia in a secret program that's been published in the
[58:17.080 --> 58:21.080]  financial time no no you're right that was that was led by Alexander Lebed
[58:21.080 --> 58:26.720]  wasn't it yes Alexander Lebed and that is that that was published in public

[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.880]  military reserve people very powerful call earlier with extremely accurate
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:58.360]  info from what I've gotten from my sources that 80% or more of the military
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.880]  young new enlisted you know nothing against them they're 18 20 years old
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:07.560]  they want to drink beer and you know do push-ups or whatever they don't really
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.120]  know what's going on but anybody who's ever been in the military just a few
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.280]  years or longer but then all the special ops people they really know total
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:21.240]  false flag and that's what Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan are saying and Rand Paul
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.520]  and the whole world press because that's what it is and see in the past
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.680]  everybody would know this but you wouldn't say it because you'd get
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.240]  demonized but see now everybody's saying it so the power to demonize and
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:41.440]  crush and Alex Jones that's over we're having a real discussion now let's go
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:47.240]  to Tyler in Tennessee inactive reserve then we'll go to
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.640]  Ozea or is that Joshua and Steve go ahead you're on the air Tyler
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.800]  so excited to be on the air Alex I've been waiting and following you for around
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.360]  four years I got something to say it's pretty important for the troops and
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.880]  first and foremost it's when you signed up the first thing you did was you took
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.200]  an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States okay
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.000]  you didn't take an oath to support and defend the president or anything like
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.160]  that you took an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies for
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.720]  domestic America is only great because we have the Constitution if you start
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:28.200]  playing by a different Constitution then you're not America anymore and you're
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:35.000]  not what's great and it's so elementary what you just said but it's it's still
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.400]  too complex for a lot of people who want to allow tyranny to take place
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.400]  because they don't want the Constitution and Bill of Rights blocking them
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.200]  from their power grabs what do you think of the new Army training manuals that
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.080]  are public in the last two weeks since judicial watch got them where they
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.680]  actually badmouth the founding fathers and say they wouldn't be welcome in
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.560]  today's military oh you know what doesn't surprise me at all here's the deal I
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:04.760]  served six years in the Air Force I've been over there and fought in Afghanistan
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.720]  I've done 4,000 miles of convoys over there and I'll tell you what what makes
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.200]  what they do is they train you before you go and they have you on the computer
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.880]  doing what's called computer-based training or CBT in these CB trees or CBT
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.840]  there's all kinds of indoctrination there's all kinds of stuff where you
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.440]  have to answer this question in the way they want it answered or you don't get
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.360]  to finish this three-hour-long CBT all right so in a lot times an answer will be
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.800]  something obvious like who you know who perpetrated 9-11 you know and it'll be
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.360]  always you know the correct answer Osama bin Laden you just have to hit that you
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.600]  have to hit that answer otherwise you don't get to complete this and if you
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.000]  don't get that turned in well then you get yelled at because you're supposed to
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.960]  have it done and so they keep they keep bombarding you with this propaganda and
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:51.240]  stuff like that against founding fathers doesn't surprise me at all yeah it's
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:56.600]  like 145 pages long and it says don't listen to people that claim they want
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.520]  to make the world a better place and talk about the Bill of Rights and
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:05.000]  Constitution they're probably extremist or even terrorist I'm paraphrasing but
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.360]  it basically I showed it last week it actually says that I mean if I was
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.440]  sitting there reading that you swear an oath to that and they're saying it's
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.000]  basically terrorist but that's what all the FBI training manuals say and I know
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.560]  who wrote it I know who wrote it because I've read it literally a hundred times
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.320]  or more Southern Poverty Law Center go ahead sorry well they'll have they'll
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.240]  have pictures on these CBT's of like people who are you know the supposed
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.240]  enemies and people you're supposed to be trained to watch out for and they'll
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.400]  have pictures of like peace protesters who are just like peacefully protesting
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.880]  and they'll be like man you better keep an eye out on these people kind of a
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.720]  thing like you never know who it could be it could be these people it could be
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.460]  anti-war protesters like like someone who's preaching against war is the
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:51.080]  person who's gonna kill you. Tell you what stay there I'm gonna come back to you
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.360]  and let you finish up them we're gonna go to Steve, John and others to get their

[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.840]  the nature of reality and we're going to be getting him on the broadcast with
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.600]  Sean Stone filmmaker and his own right actor obviously the son of Oliver Stone
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.920]  he'll be giving us his take on the Middle East he's traveled over there
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:03.360]  extensively right now we're taking phone calls from active duty or people that
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:07.800]  are in the reserves or people that recently got out who've been talking
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.280]  to friends and family that are in the military what is their take on aiding
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:19.800]  radical Islamic groups over in the Middle East IE al Qaeda this is now a big
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.600]  firestorm as Rand Paul comes out and says I don't want to send our boys over
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.440]  there to fight for al Qaeda against Christians to impose Serial Law in
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:34.240]  Syria and in two different shows the McLaughlin group and Newsmax that Buchanan
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.280]  comes out and says it's clearly a false flag staged event Ron Paul says it Rand
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:45.440]  Paul says it this is panicking the system then thousands of military personnel
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.800]  take photos of themselves with a sheet of paper saying I don't want to fight on
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:58.240]  the side of al Qaeda in Syria wake up America and May 3 media claims military
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.240]  revolt against Obama is a hoax even though these people have this on their
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.760]  own Facebook and their own Twitter's some of them are officers saying who they
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:11.240]  are watch them start trying to court-martial them I like to see them
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.200]  actually get convicted it didn't gonna happen and it's this type of action that
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.120]  brought down Chalcescu and Romania that brought down the Soviet Union if the
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.480]  military wakes up and the police wake up and start realizing the paradigm of how
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.800]  the globalists are funding radicals to attack us so they have a pretext to take
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:32.520]  our liberties it's game over that's why this is such a big deal and Obama was
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:38.360]  gonna launch this new war expand the old war to open air bombardment because his
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.840]  al Qaeda forces are losing now that's imploding there's a good chance they're
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.200]  not gonna get the votes in the house that's coming out now Rand Paul and
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.440]  others have talked to the folks in the house Boehner is in there saying well
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.840]  we need to vote for military action because of what Assad did it's been
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.640]  proven that the rebels did it it's certainly not been proven that Assad
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.200]  did it Wayne Madsen's gonna join us in five minutes formerly with the NSA
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.720]  syndicate a columnist and amazing journals to give us his inside scoop on
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.760]  this he's always got the latest on on on how big a defeat this is for the
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.560]  globalists will get his take on that and where he thinks they're going from
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.640]  here will they stage a false flag to try to get everybody back in line under
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.960]  this paradigm of fear and to go against logic and to work with al Qaeda do I get
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.120]  an apology from all the neocon talk show host of the tack me over the years
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.320]  pointing out that elements of our government run al Qaeda no I'm not
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:36.240]  gonna hold my breath but see I don't want an apology all I want is to go back
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.240]  to being more of a free country I don't have any illusions will ever be perfect
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.920]  I just want to be somewhat free I just want to swing the pendulum back in the
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.040]  other direction not headlong over the edge of a cliff towards total
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:56.040]  despotism now let's real quick go back to Tyler wanted to finish up in active
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.120]  reserve talking to your friends talking to other people that are in the
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.360]  military are they upset about the funding of al Qaeda what is what is their
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.120]  take on what's happening and what do you make of the of the dinosaur media
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:13.360]  saying nobody in the military is upset about this oh I think that it's an
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.680]  absolute atrocity for them to even claim that I think it's apparent that the
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.600]  military is definitely not behind it and you know for the past couple years I've
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:27.080]  always been through the black sheet you know in my you know with the guys I was
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:30.480]  working with you know bringing up issues because they weren't quite aware but I
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:36.120]  tell you what now as I had to become more comfortable with this reality there
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.120]  they're more comfortable you know cut letting people know their opinions now
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.720]  and they do you know they're surprised to learn that many people actually agree
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:46.280]  with them you know many people actually agree them hey I don't I don't I don't
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:49.560]  support this war in fact I don't support any of these wars I mean I've gone over
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.840]  there and I followed orders but you know it's not something of politically it's
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.680]  not when I support and actually it's the one of the primary reasons that I got
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:03.200]  out I just got out about a month ago well Tyler God bless you so were you in
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.120]  the army the Marines what were you an active in or you said Air Force yes
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.320]  there wasn't Air Force yeah I learned a lot right after Benghazi from an Air
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:19.200]  Force MP was high level on a flight back from the west he was going to be the
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:27.000]  main guy at a burial of a fellow that had died by an IED was his buddy and he
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.920]  talked about Air Force security running convoys how dangerous it was and you're
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:34.520]  saying that's what you did in Afghanistan yes sir that's actually what I did about
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.240]  I did about 4,000 miles of convoy out there and primarily in southern
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:42.960]  Afghanistan with the crew of about 40 something dudes and Air Force isn't
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.320]  typically know we're not usually known for doing convoy stuff that's what we
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.600]  look doing but no it's just interesting because that's what sure sure because I
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.760]  mean I met this guy well these two guys but really talks this one guy for like
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.160]  two hours back on a flight and then I saw it in the paper you know him in the
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.400]  paper in the burial and all that and but he was just telling me well about how
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:08.200]  much combat the Air Force sees now around these bases thanks a lot I
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.640]  appreciate you calling into the show what Tyler just talked about is exactly
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.840]  what I'm getting from all my military sources and again it's very very
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:23.480]  frustrating to see the dinosaur media basically say oh that's all just a hoax
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:30.760]  when it's not a hoax the military is very very upset about what's going on and
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:40.400]  we the people should be upset but Tyler is a shock true years ago he'd tell his
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.520]  buddies about this and they just couldn't believe it but now because they
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.840]  heard all this before now that they're seeing it happen again now they're
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:54.120]  fully waking up and that's why you see as the earlier callers said 80 to 90% of
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:15:00.280]  the special forces guys that he works with are awake and very upset well of
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.240]  course because they're involved in all the secret stuff folks they have to go
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.360]  actually train can you imagine having to train jihadis so they bring in and
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:14.880]  who they tell to cut off their beards and they tell to you know not upset the
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.920]  troops and just get their training but these guys start shooting their mouths
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.840]  off and start getting in arguments with the special forces who've got you know
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:29.200]  tattoos that say infidel on them most of them you run into have like infidel
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:35.040]  on their forearm or are on their trigger finger or other expletives
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.600]  towards Muslim extremists can you imagine these guys are all in there
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.840]  together and they're having to train them I mean there's fights breaking out
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:46.360]  that I've been told about them shooting each other I mean this is really bad
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:52.000]  folks the troops have to train al-qaeda and al-qaeda light and all this other
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.840]  garbage and it's incredible and they are burning up and blowing up the
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:02.840]  churches they are engaging all this and and the military is at the breaking
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:07.680]  point over this in fact I can't believe it's gone this far and I don't know what
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:12.200]  the breaking point is going to be but the New World Order has really miscalculated
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.920]  they've jumped the shark we're gonna go back to your calls but I want to get
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.920]  Wayne Madsen's take on this Wayne Madsen formally with the NSA in Navy
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.360]  anti-submarine warfare before that written for some of the biggest
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:27.680]  publications in the country Wayne Madsen report.com is his site to read his
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:32.960]  updates in weekly journal and Wayne I don't know your take on all this yet but
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.920]  but you just heard what I said about the military being freaked out give us the
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.760]  highlights of what's happening in Syria where you think this is going how big a
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:45.720]  defeat it is for Obama that he said he was gonna attack last week but then had
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:51.320]  to go to Congress and what the word is on how on how on how historical this is
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.440]  am I wrong in saying what we're seeing is the type of stuff that led up to the
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:01.120]  collapse of the Soviet Union? Yes partially Alex and I can tell you that
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.320]  as of last Friday and this comes from White House sources who were willing to
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.880]  talk about what happened last Friday night last Friday night President Obama
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:17.200]  had agreed to launch probably in the wee hours of Saturday morning east coast
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:25.880]  time this cruise missile attack and possibly with a drone attack on Syrian
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:34.280]  targets he bought off on what was pressured upon him by our ambassador to
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:40.040]  the U.N. Susan Rice the national I should say Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha
[01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:45.480]  Power the National Security Advisor and former Ambassador to the U.N. Susan
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.720]  Rice Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes so I would point out has two
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:18:00.440]  brothers in executive positions at CBS News and NBC News and also Secretary of
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:07.680]  State Kerry chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey general Dempsey
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:12.960]  visited the White House very early in the morning on Saturday morning right
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:20.120]  after midnight with one last plea and basically told Obama look if you attack
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.440]  Syria you're going to get in deep and when you get in deep without
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:30.040]  congressional authorization you're going to be screwed upon hearing that from
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:36.880]  Dempsey Obama decided to hold off try to get congressional approval and I guess
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:43.040]  we can thank in this case so much unlike what happened with President Kennedy
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:49.920]  and the Cuban Missile Crisis in this case the generals actually stood in the way
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.840]  between Obama attacking Syria and maintaining this very tenuous piece and
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.240]  by the way everything you're saying has actually been in the Israeli news and a
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.040]  lot of us been confirmed and it's on record that Dempsey keeps telling Obama
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.980]  don't do it and then Obama got up there on a Saturday afternoon speech and
[01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:12.040]  wide and said Dempsey was behind his plan but I guess he means Dempsey said
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:17.600]  you better get congressional approval and not go this alone well Dempsey is not
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.600]  all not only convinced Obama to get congressional approval which is by no
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:29.160]  means a sure thing but also we at Dempsey is is of the opinion that once
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:36.480]  this conflagration begins the Pentagon will not necessarily necessarily be
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:42.200]  able to stop it because of the war games that the Pentagon has conducted over the
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:46.920]  years that all many of which show that this thing could spiral out of control
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:52.500]  just like with an attack preemptive military attack on Iran this preemptive
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:57.120]  military attack on Syria sure some of the same results sure I mean don't don't
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.720]  most analysts including former chairman of the Joint Chiefs former members of
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:04.880]  the Joint Chiefs they're all on record saying this would probably turn into a
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:11.240]  bigger regional war Syria and Iran will hit Israel then Israel might respond
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:16.120]  even with nukes or the US gets drug in then it's the Russians then it's World
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:22.240]  War three and what's the American geopolitical reason this only hurts our
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.240]  interest with Assad who in the last again eight years tried to start working
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:33.200]  with the West it the message is you try to democratize and work with us we're
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.960]  gonna turn Al Qaeda loose in your country this has to do with Obama trying to
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:48.480]  placate a bunch of adolescent as far as military strategy is concerned and
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:55.160]  Samantha Power Susan Rice or nothing more than a couple of spoiled brats who
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:00.200]  want to you know they feel the way you get you get somebody like Assad is just
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:05.280]  to attack them we have this Ben Rose who obviously is part of this operation
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:11.640]  where there's two brothers at CBS and NBC to gin up the propaganda for the war but
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:17.880]  they're not listening to the season military strategist the season
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:23.560]  military officers who know what is going to happen when we do this
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:29.080]  Obama's listening to these responsibility to protect you know so some a
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:33.600]  group of people stubbed their toe in some country they want to go in and you
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:38.440]  know with the full force of the United States and rectify the situation that's
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.240]  not how geopolitical plus that's a total cover it's about regime change
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.040]  breaking that country up in multiple parts they've been they started it two
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.520]  and a half years ago but expanding on this I don't think the new old order is
[01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:55.960]  gonna fall tomorrow my point is is that there is a collapse in confidence in the
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:02.200]  system the military is waking up and it's panicking the power structure and I'm
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.600]  not the only one saying that a former member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.000]  general Jack Keen is saying that the New York Times you've got dr. Paul Craig
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.680]  Roberts saying it's the biggest diplomatic failure in in forever I mean it
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.520]  makes them look like total fools but in a way that's scarier that it is a bunch
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.600]  of weirdo women nothing it's women but these women are weirdo nanny state
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:30.440]  women playing general and all these weirdo neocons you know who are too
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:35.200]  busy you know hanging out you know what they're doing the point is is it it it's
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.120]  almost more scary though that you've got a bunch of weirdos on power trips and
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:45.200]  bankers trying to call military shots against Russia and China through this
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.520]  proxy and so I want you to comment on that but first go back historically how
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:54.860]  big a deal is this is this defeat for Obama the fact that the British
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:23:00.080]  parliament for the first time voted not to go to war not to authorize war since
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:06.920]  1782 when they voted not to maintain Britain's colonial army the army of
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:12.480]  occupation in the American colonies and and then decided to sue for peace this
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.800]  is a big deal because this effectively drives a stake in what was known as the
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:25.480]  US-British special relationship look the central command in Tampa is now
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.720]  freezing out all British military officers from all planning
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.880]  I forgot that's in the Associated Press how big a deal is that that that like
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:38.320]  like childishly blaming the British military like they're the parliament
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:42.760]  when our own military doesn't want to do it clearly above the military ordering
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:47.320]  all the British officers thrown out of the war rooms this is I mean this is
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:53.800]  incredible it is and you know we're one step away I guess from the the the
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:24:01.080]  officers club at that MacDill Air Force Base serving up Thomas freedom muffins
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:08.400]  and and offering up free to mail and and free to marmalade you know you know
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.000]  it's childish it's absolutely childish what we're seeing happen but look this
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.600]  isn't the this isn't the generals doing this to their British officer colleagues
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.640]  this is this is coming from the White House this is the same sort of petty
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:29.120]  punishment we saw with one that when the French opted not to support us with
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:34.080]  the foolish invasion of my right by the way the British have now responded just
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:38.160]  to finish up the point you raised by saying fine there won't be another vote
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.960]  even if there's another nerve gas attack because they know they're just gonna
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.960]  stage another one so now rebuffing them now the British are gonna act childish
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.640]  this is the kind of stuff you see before regimes disintegrate that's right
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:56.200]  and and and you're right this this is a this is a sea change but let's look at
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:00.480]  what's happening in light of what's happening with the revelations of Edward
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.000]  Snowden the NSA whistleblower this is like a double and if you add in the
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.240]  WikiLeaks stuff which I don't put a whole lot of weight on the WikiLeaks
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:14.160]  disclosures not as much as the NSA stuff but we we're seeing at least a double
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:19.440]  whammy against the United States you've got Dilma Rousseff the Brazilian
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:25.200]  president thinking about as canceling her state visit to Washington the only
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:30.440]  state visit that Obama has scheduled for this year because of NSA he's dropping
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.480]  on her private communication you've got Obama canceling any more press conferences
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.600]  this is a collapse level event it really is we're seeing I think what we're
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:46.800]  seeing is the beginning of the end of this American exceptionalism around the
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:51.400]  world that we we can do anything we want and expect everybody go we'll go along
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:59.440]  with this rush is not buying as China is not buying this I think we're seeing the
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.400]  beginning the beginning of the end of the American Empire we will probably
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:08.960]  wind up being a regional power with influence over the Caribbean and Canada
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:15.200]  and some of the Pacific Ocean countries but nothing like what we see today and
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.520]  I want to explain something I believe this is the beginning of the rebirth of
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.680]  the Republic because it's not an American Empire that we use that term to
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:29.040]  because that's what's known it's a globalist Bankster Empire using America
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.160]  and our treasure and our name the only reason we were honored and the reason
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:36.280]  people worked with us was because compared to the other countries and
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:41.320]  empires we were guys that played somewhat more fair but as soon as we lost
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.400]  that soft power and as soon as the world figured out we had wicked people
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.280]  running us all the power is draining out and because we are occupied by the
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.720]  globalist here in America that just doesn't mean the rest of the world isn't
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.480]  going to be occupied now it means we aren't going to be occupied as bad
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:02.720]  because as they fall back here and say well at least we can rule America that's
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.720]  not going to work either because as soon as the dollars dead it's over for the
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.200]  federal government and the New World Order and all these idiot federal workers
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.480]  pensions and all and most of them aren't bad people actually know that's true but
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.360]  but the types that think you know they they rule the roost you know they let me
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.040]  tell you this is going to get wild though Wayne yeah and the other thing we're
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:28.120]  saying too is that we're seeing faulty intelligence being sold the French and
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.720]  German intelligence reports they're not showing any evidence they're saying
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:38.040]  believe us you know after the British dodgy dossier that got that got us
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.040]  convinced that we should go into Iraq and got the British people convinced go in
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:46.520]  Iraq nobody should be falling for this stuff out of the intelligence agencies
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:53.360]  you know basically Obama is relying almost exclusively on Israeli signals
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.000]  intelligence said to become from intercepts by unit 8200 that's Israel's
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.640]  version the NSA of Syrian commanders ordering this attack we nobody can make
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:06.720]  the determination that the Syrian government had anything to do with the
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.800]  attack until the actual missiles that are being cited by the French are
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.920]  actually in you know examined to make sure that they actually ever had a
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:21.840]  anything like sarin gas but what we do know is al-Qaeda in in Syria has been
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:26.920]  caught manufacturing sarin gas at three facilities in Iraq two in Baghdad one
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.880]  in one of the outlying provinces they they were caught using chlorine gas to
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.160]  attack civilians in the city of homes last March and they've been caught with
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:39.680]  sarin gas in Turkey and they've also been caught with mustard yeah they're
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:45.280]  getting caught over and over again our allies with these different gases poison
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:50.240]  gases and then they still have the nerve to blame Assad but no one what do you
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.480]  make of Pat Buchanan Ron Paul Rand Paul all coming out saying false flag I
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:00.400]  mean this is exciting yes I am glad I'm glad they're finally putting false flag
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:05.400]  into the lexicon of American politics because we've been treated to these
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:09.960]  false flags so many times in the past and immediately people are accused of
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.520]  being conspiracy theorists my last question here's my last question Wayne
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.680]  Madsen what about false flag isn't that one of the only tools they've got now
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.240]  is a big domestic or foreign false flag to blame on and say see we told you so
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.360]  yeah that's exactly what's going on that's why the BBC ran a phony
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:30.480]  photograph a false photograph of dead civilians in Iraq and said these were
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.000]  these were people that were killed by the siren attack in Syria this has
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.320]  happened time and time again we've seen a video of canisters being handled by
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:45.240]  Chechen guerrillas that were taking them into Syria to give them over to the
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:49.480]  rebels so incredible yeah Wayne Madsen thank you so much sir we'll talk to you

[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:06.060]  we're changing history we're I'm not taking credit for more than maybe five
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:08.980]  percent of it it's probably a lot more than that but it's kind of scary to
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:13.820]  realize that but we actually study the reality put out the most accurate info
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:18.420]  we can no matter how painful it is tell it like it is what the chips folder they
[01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:23.180]  may and then over the years it gets picked up by others they look at it
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:27.420]  they research it and then new events happen people research it they know what
[01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:32.300]  to look for and boom the truth comes out we knew two days after the underwear
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:37.260]  bombing that a US government agency got the drug mutalib on the plane we had a
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:41.020]  lawyer and his wife on who were there and saw him put on the plane
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:44.700]  Kurt Haskell was a listener was aware of false flag he was watching him the
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:48.460]  whole time and later everything Kurt Haskell said came out in congressional
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:53.940]  testimony indeed the CIA put the drug mutalib on the plane with a firecracker
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:57.700]  in his pants as the pretext to roll out all the naked body scanners there's just
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:04.140]  one example of hundreds of things we've broke here we break the rebels launching
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:08.620]  the chemical attack on video we were a platform for others expanding on that
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:12.420]  like world that daily I mean when I realized the amount of stuff we're
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:16.660]  actually breaking the amount of things that we're actually paradigm shifting it
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:24.300]  is it is incredible and I'm not on a power trip I feel unworthy and pathetic
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:28.700]  every day when I get up here that Alex you've got to cover this oh you've got
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:32.100]  to cover that and then a guest brings up something and I go my gosh yeah I forgot
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:37.780]  this and I mean it's a train wreck a lot of days but it's real and people know
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:43.420]  that but this is not scripture this is the opposite of teleprompter TV or
[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:48.020]  radio this is the opposite of talking points this is study history study the
[01:38:48.020 --> 01:38:52.580]  present study what the globalist want what they're trying to build I want to

[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:58.060]  taking action nothing can stop us now for the balance of the hour we're joined
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:01.900]  here by Sean Stone he really doesn't need any introduction he's probably been
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:04.820]  on the show seven eight times over the years got a chance to get to know him
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:11.460]  well working on the Jesse Ventura last season and of course also admire a lot
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:17.180]  of the work his dad's done with films like like JFK and so many others but
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:21.580]  his father recently in fact I forgot to tell you guys to pull the clip up of you
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:25.900]  have it you remembered in Japan that's not why I got him on but it's interesting
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:31.340]  saying Obama is a snake time to turn on him again that's something that a lot of
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:35.580]  the progressives and real liberals don't have the nerve to do but but but Sean
[01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:40.700]  Stone does as really a historian he's got his award-winning series on history but
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:44.260]  but usually when I get Sean Stone on it's not about his dad because he's done a
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:48.900]  lot of stuff on his own right and I'll imagine down the road when my son's
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:53.140]  doing interviews people he'll be sick of hearing about me but that is newsworthy
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:58.460]  what your what your dad has said I think that's a good segue into Syria your take
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:02.100]  on the state of the world Sean Stone what do you make of your father's bold
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:09.140]  stance and why he said that hey Alex yeah no I I think he came to the
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:13.700]  realization in the course of this history series as to what Obama's really
[01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:17.060]  about you know we said it last year you and I when we did it in the impeach
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:21.780]  Obama video and actually you know I wanted to reiterate the fact that
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:25.660]  remember in the impeach Obama video we started out by saying that congressman
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:29.660]  Walter Jones said that if Obama commits us to war in Syria without going through
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:33.060]  Congress he should be impeached and that was one year ago so it's important to
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:36.740]  remind people that that we were just you know on on point then and it's still
[01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:40.380]  relevant and it's still an important source for people to go to and look at
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:44.820]  as the impeach Obama 2012 video or go to impeach Obama 2012.com so I think now
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:47.820]  like now even more one year later we were a little bit ahead of the curve
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:50.980]  there but now even you know people like my father coming out and saying and I
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:56.820]  think many people feel that way more and more probably from both left and right
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:02.460]  you're absolutely right and Walter Jones is coming on later in the week and he
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:07.260]  does have that bill introduced I think this is a sea change moment where the
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:11.900]  establishment is really being seen for what they are where where the public is
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:17.060]  taking the red pill are putting on the sunglasses like and they live like and
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:21.420]  they live like exactly which we'll get into soon but yeah I mean that's why we
[01:43:21.420 --> 01:43:25.380]  you know Tyrell Ventura Jesse Ventura's son and I have been working on this
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:29.020]  show called Buzzsaw which we feel like is that we feel the continuation of
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:33.420]  conspiracy theory because as you know Tyrell and I took over a lot of the
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.820]  duties on conspiracy theory in the last season of doing the interviews while
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:42.220]  Jesse was unable to travel and so now on this on Buzzsaw we kind of do you
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:45.900]  know our alternative media like kind of like what you do with art you know with
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:49.100]  the guests we want to bring on we have interviews and it's once a week on the
[01:43:49.100 --> 01:43:52.060]  you know usually we air on the weekends but that's getting you know that's
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.580]  growing and following and that you know hopefully the point is that you know
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:58.780]  shows like yours like ours the alternative media in general RT is doing a
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:01.860]  lot of good news the point is that people in the United States are just not
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:05.860]  realizing the fact the amount of that they have been let's say that you know
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:09.100]  that they live phenomenon of putting the sunglasses on the American people
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:12.700]  don't realize how much that is has occurred to them you see we don't get
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:16.780]  to travel as easily we're cut off from the rest of the world for the most part
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:19.980]  so we don't have that interaction whereas you know in Europe you can travel
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:23.180]  very easily from country to country within a couple hours the Middle East is
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:28.180]  very close by you get access to Russian Russia today Al Jazeera alternative
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:32.540]  media sources BBC that gives different points of view here in America we're
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:36.300]  very cut off so I think the point is for the internet talk shows and you know
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:39.460]  alternative media to get across to get people another perspective on what's
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:42.940]  really happening in the world and how much the media really is what controls
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:47.900]  our perception of reality and so we need to become the media we need to create
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:55.580]  art and information and analysis from a truthful perspective to counter the
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:59.100]  lies if we all just start doing it it's over and by the way I've seen some of
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:04.820]  your shows on buzz saw a very very interesting tell folks about that well
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:11.380]  buzz saw is is sponsored by the lip TV which is an online I guess you say
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:16.260]  online studio so the lip we know came to us and just said we they're doing talk
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:20.700]  shows they want you know talk-oriented content and obviously with when it comes
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:23.900]  to Tyrell Ventura and I we're very you know we're talking to people we'll get
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:27.620]  in there we want to talk about conspiracies we want to talk about you
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:33.540]  know the the alternative the stoting case with the in the Bradley Manning case
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:36.980]  by speaking with Daniel Ellsberg for example we talked to Jeremy Scahill
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:41.180]  about 30 wars we also even went to the UFO phenomenon and talked to people like
[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.900]  Steve Bassett who is sponsoring the citizens hearing on disclosure on
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:50.060]  aliens bringing 40 plus people from the military from all walks of government
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:55.980]  life to talk about their encounters with some kind of UFO phenomenon or you know
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:59.660]  strange anomalies so we get into all these different a lot of interesting
[01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:03.420]  stuff wow Sean Stone joins us right now I want to play this clip since we
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:10.100]  mentioned it of your father just a few weeks ago in Japan speaking out and
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:15.940]  saying it's time to turn on Obama here's that clip Obama is a snake
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:27.780]  snake and everybody's probably seen the long clip it's up on info wars.com we
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:32.620]  played it a few weeks ago but the point here is that the reason you got a turn
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:36.940]  on Obama is he's the more effective of evils he's able to sell the globalist
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:42.460]  agenda whereas a stuffy George Bush or Bill Clinton couldn't do it as well it's
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:46.900]  the cult of Obama must be destroyed do you agree with that Sean Stone let's
[01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:51.140]  talk about the latest developments in Syria yeah 100% I agree I think that
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:54.220]  the point is that he's the great deceiver and that's why people you know
[01:46:54.220 --> 01:46:57.580]  have called him the anti-Christ or whatnot because he's the one who promises
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:01.100]  hope and change but he comes from a completely deceptive point in fact you
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:06.020]  know we I believe that he's either under hypnosis or I know he I'm pretty
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:10.700]  sure 100% sure he uses hypnosis in his speech he does in LP that's on record
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:16.100]  yeah 100% he but whether or not he all himself is hypnotized or under mind
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:19.660]  control that's another possibility and I'm not entirely sure what he is because
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:22.900]  to me Obama is a phenomenon that doesn't exist you know no one quite knows who he
[01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:27.420]  is no one knows who he is yeah yeah very very mysterious almost like Hitler if
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:32.500]  you think about the context of someone who had that well again always they
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:35.120]  bring foreign entities don't they you know whether it's Stalin from a
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:38.740]  Georgian taking over Russia whether it's Napoleon born apart from course of
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:41.980]  taking over France whether it's Hitler from from Austria taking over Germany
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:45.340]  Obama not from the United States taking over the United States it's
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:48.100]  interesting to see this in these similarities historically when I say
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:52.020]  Hitler I just mean the fact that he had this as Hitler does a lot of us is
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.220]  tremendous this tremendous ability to make people listen and believe him when
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:59.500]  he speaks and it's it's a very persuasive form of hypnosis that he uses
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:03.300]  and and far more dangerous than bushes because bush just wasn't basically a
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:06.660]  jackass and he knew it and he spoke that way and you knew that you knew what it
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:10.980]  was you knew the quantity that it was Obama you don't really know how evil
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:17.340]  this guy can get very well said I see this though as the matrix collapsing or
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:21.300]  as I said putting the sunglasses on like they live that we'll talk about with
[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:26.700]  mr. Piper coming up there in the next hour but I mean I can't believe that
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:30.740]  it's all over the news false flag not just Ron Paul or Rand Paul or Pat Buchanan
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:34.380]  but all these other hosts are saying it and all these analysts are saying and
[01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:39.900]  every military officer I talked to on or off record says false flag and and we
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:44.380]  don't want to work with Al Qaeda I mean I've never seen such a route and a month
[01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:48.900]  ago the Pentagon came out and said we're losing the info or no one believes us I
[01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:53.780]  mean this really is amazing I think you know Alex to be honest with you I think
[01:48:53.780 --> 01:48:59.700]  this gives credit to the movement that you my father Jesse Ventura and I and
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:02.340]  well what not we know we are a continuation of time of insurance
[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:06.340]  continuation all of us together has all been building towards is that since the
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:09.660]  point that we became aware that the New World Order was a real phenomenon and
[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:13.260]  these guys you know have had this long-term agenda of shifting America
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:17.660]  away from Republic into this kind of imperial police world policemen which
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:21.700]  most most Americans do not want to see right any real American doesn't want to
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:24.980]  see the United States becoming the world's policemen as we've seen this
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:28.580]  world New World Order phenomenon you know take place we've been fighting it
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:31.540]  you know there's a many others who are fighting the war and the fact is that as
[01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:34.660]  a result it's like the collective consciousness is kind of I believe
[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:37.900]  shifting and people are starting to wake up and it's like for me once shame on
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:41.060]  you know shame on you for me twice shame on me and that's where we are now is
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:44.620]  that that point of you know we're not gonna be you can't keep fooling the
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:50.100]  American public I agree with you so what do you expect to happen now short-term
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:52.860]  mid-term long-term I mean I think they're gonna do everything they can to
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:57.540]  try to put us back in the box but every angle I look at there's no way they're
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:01.460]  gonna end up beating us in the end it's gonna get really nasty but I don't
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:07.220]  see them winning I don't see them winning the most I believe that what's
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:10.620]  happened I think the real you know motivation behind the Syria war me if
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:13.540]  you look at the Syria war from a strategic point of view it's World War
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:17.100]  3 right I mean the point is if the Americans say hey we're gonna hit Syria
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:20.060]  and then the Russians say okay we're gonna retaliating in Saudi Arabia and
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:23.100]  the Iranians you don't know what they're gonna do right well they just arm his
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:26.660]  bull against Israel or whatnot the point is that you get a con conflagration if
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:30.300]  the Russians and with or without the Chinese is the Russians along get
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.340]  involved in the Syria in the Middle East because of Syria right you have now
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:37.660]  World War 3 taking the current whether it becomes nuclear or not we don't know
[01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:40.620]  stay there let's talk about what all the experts are saying I agree with you
[01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:44.500]  that's why Dempsey's telling Obama not to do it and Dempsey's known to be a
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:47.700]  warmonger by the way they kept getting rid of chairman to get somebody who'd
[01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:51.820]  go along with it and now Dempsey's getting all the intel and goes no because
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:55.980]  folks the sod's gonna pull out all those Russian weapons and just start blasting
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:59.460]  Israel then Israel's gonna take the clubs off and all hell is gonna break

[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:19.380]  Sean Stone is our guest documentary filmmaker actor in his own right
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:24.660]  obviously a lot of work with his father as well Oliver Stone we've got the man
[01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:29.300]  I tell you since I was a teenager watching they live I've wanted to get
[01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:34.060]  Roddy Piper on and he's going to be coming on the show I don't know for
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:38.300]  30 45 minutes coming up the next hour and I promise we'll get to the active
[01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:43.060]  duty and former military Steve and John and Will and Mike and Jeff everybody
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:47.300]  else that's on here we're going to get to you especially coming up in the next
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:51.580]  segment or so because we'll get Piper on it eight after because some stations
[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:56.100]  join us then so he'll be on with us at the second segment of the next hour but
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:55:01.260]  going back to Sean Stone you know that same question looking at World War Three
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:06.420]  and how crazy the establishment is obviously the people above Obama know
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:14.100]  this is very dangerous why then are they pushing for this to my to my
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:19.620]  understanding of it it's more of a it's like because basically the casino is
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:25.180]  cashed out and they have to decide how the best way to evacuate you know how
[01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:27.780]  do you basically you know the point is that we know the financial system is
[01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:31.660]  still you know a fraud and it's still in K in chaos fundamentally you know
[01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:34.780]  there's not there's no stability in this show a big war is a way to burn down
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:39.740]  the casino essentially I mean I would say it's a I think it's it's somewhere
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:45.660]  between that there's the mystical element of you know the red the biblical
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:49.020]  concept of apocalypse and you know the idea that we have to have some kind of
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:52.980]  world war for revelation to occur I mean I think there's a lot of different
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:57.340]  mentalities involved the idea of Nibiru the planet X right has is
[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:01.380]  returning and this is part of like the end times so if you formulate all these
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:04.660]  things together then yes it looks like okay then World War Three is
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:08.220]  inevitable but my thinking is that it's not actually inevitable that we can we
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:11.260]  can return gradually to a republic I don't think that going back to the
[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:13.700]  Republic is gonna be an easy thing for the United States to do because we've
[01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:19.020]  gone so far towards this imperial system of military empire towards the idea of
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:23.060]  the you know national security state total warfare at all times constant fear
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:26.700]  of terrorism but I believe that if we can stop at least this war from occurring
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:30.540]  we can step by step gradually bring us back towards where we were which is a
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:35.100]  republic that's you know that's secure within its its sense of self that
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:38.860]  doesn't need to extend out with it you know with the British imperial policy
[01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:42.980]  of forcing free trade upon countries you know we need to go towards next form
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:46.380]  of energy I think oil is a real still major factor in all this we need to go
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:51.660]  beyond oil we know now cold fusion is realistic and possible the Andrea Rossi
[01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:55.500]  experiments were even reported about in Forbes magazine that he achieved four
[01:56:55.500 --> 01:57:00.700]  times of the power of oil generated that oil generates through his through his
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:04.100]  machine so I mean you're talking between fission fusion processes we have to get
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:07.700]  beyond this oil thing and then already you're gonna get you're gonna see our
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:10.260]  attention is gonna shift away from the Middle East and all in these wars there
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:15.140]  which are really natural gas and oil base as far as the economy is concerned and
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:19.060]  they're trying to shift into Asia I just see the globalist above all the
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:22.300]  nations playing them off against each other and I know that's in a really a
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:26.140]  simplistic way to put it but that's that's what globalism is I just think
[01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:29.420]  spiritually the controllers are blind because they know how to manipulate
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:34.060]  reality but they don't understand they have knowledge to manipulate it but they
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:38.500]  don't look 20 steps down how it's going to affect their own progeny and they
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:45.020]  think that they are immune from all the sins they commit against humanity when
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:50.460]  all common sense and knowledge shows it will all come back on them well you know
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:54.300]  this is very interesting discussion again this is more of the spiritual side
[01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:58.220]  of things as far as I you know from people I've seen within the families
[01:57:58.220 --> 01:58:02.260]  let's say oftentimes the people the kids were born these satanic cults and
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:05.020]  whatnot because that's really what they were talking about the highest level is
[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:09.260]  essentially it's it's a form of Satanism and ego worship and the ego
[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:14.900]  worship would would basically like the class of the classic Greek myths the
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:19.460]  father would eat their eat his own son right the kids will be sacrificed for
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.220]  the sake of the family for the for the ruler for the father not willing to
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:25.980]  sacrifice his position and that's maybe what you're looking at yeah no that's
[01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:29.460]  like the emperor wanting to kill Darth Vader at the end it's like always
[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:33.380]  killing the next generation the oligarch view we're gonna come back five more
[01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:37.100]  minutes with you and then you're gonna ride shotgun with rowdy piper coming up
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:53.020]  I'm really excited about this are we choosing our own destiny or has it been
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:56.700]  pre-selected for us as we've moved through history every great leader has
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:01.300]  had to understand the potential of information billions of dollars have
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:07.620]  been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:13.060]  from compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine we
[01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:17.260]  are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when
[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:21.060]  somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it
[01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:24.620]  out and verifying if they can take total control of your awareness all of this
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:28.780]  is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:32.980]  opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:42.580]  a war because there's a war on or your mind get your copy of state of mind the
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:48.020]  movie at info wars dot com and remember every order at info wars store dot com
[01:59:48.020 --> 01:59:51.700]  receives a free citizen rule book
[01:59:51.700 --> 02:00:00.540]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the GCN radio network

[02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:23.380]  alex jones
[02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:35.140]  rowdy ronnie piper is minutes away from sean stone's house he got stuck in
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:38.340]  traffic but that's fine because he's not supposed to be on to the next segment
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:43.380]  so that's coming up 25th anniversary of they live sean stone director researcher
[02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:47.460]  talk show host is our guest I will get to all the people that are holding if you
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:50.380]  can't hold that's fine you can hang up I won't get mad at you but I want to hear
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:54.700]  from active duty or former military about the open funding of al-qaeda and
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:59.180]  what your take is on that but but Sean I know that you went to some of the most
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:03.220]  elite universities you've been around the hollywood elite big time your dad
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:06.740]  obviously being Oliver stone you yourself is something like 30 movies you've
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:09.860]  been in a lot of them some of the biggest out there when you talk about
[02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:14.860]  satanic cults and you know not in your family but stuff you've seen and you
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:18.940]  talk about this Illuminati you know I mean I know you've told me stuff off
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:23.220]  records that I mean you were just getting into all that what can you tell
[02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:27.260]  people about hollywood and the government and and what percentage of them
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:34.060]  would you say are practicing Illuminati satanist well honestly this has been
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:39.300]  kind of a lifetimes endeavor of constantly you know deepening my
[02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:42.180]  knowledge and trying to understand better because you know as you know when
[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:46.820]  oftentimes when you talk to people who have been through very terrible things
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:50.740]  as children you know whether the satanic ritual ritual abuse for example
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:56.180]  sexual abuse things like this it's hard to know at what level they've been
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:59.180]  traumatized and they're you know are they may at what point are they are
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:04.260]  they fictionalizing or fantasizing things and on what level are they real so I
[02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:07.180]  you know as you know it's a very it's a long discussion it's a very difficult
[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:11.140]  thing to get into my belief though fundamentally is look I was watching
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:13.500]  the card at the keeping up with the Kardashians last night because I've
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:17.140]  never seen the show and I'm just curious to know why a satanic family like that
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:20.580]  is being put on the air so blatantly because if you think about it that's
[02:02:20.580 --> 02:02:25.180]  what it is how are the you know deaf kids or not kids but adults talking so
[02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:28.260]  openly blatantly about sex in front of their mother but I guess you know the
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:32.900]  point is the mother herself as far as I'm told actually filmed Kim Kardashian
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:35.900]  her daughter having sex with this guy in that porn video was filmed by the
[02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:41.060]  mother and you start to think wait isn't that what satanism really is isn't it
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:44.540]  that that that exploitation of your own children isn't it the idea of being able
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:49.420]  to to have no limitations have no boundaries as far as you know making
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:53.420]  money and profiting off of off of your loved ones or you know especially your
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:56.740]  children I mean isn't that the worst crime of all yeah no it's about betrayal
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:03:00.380]  and I see that spirit actually growing in the world but also the spirit of good
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:03.900]  is growing for every action there's an equal or opposite reaction where people
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:08.220]  get into betraying you even though it's not even good for them in business they
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:12.020]  can't help it right right because there's a cycle and you have to keep
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:14.940]  feeding it that's the that's I think where America is at that kind of point
[02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:17.860]  where we've been feeding we've been feeding on other countries and feeding on
[02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:21.980]  the third world we have no problem you know that imperial demon that was really
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:24.940]  from the British I did an interview on Buzzsaw with Douglas Dietrich who was a
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:29.820]  guy who worked with Michael Aquino the very famous satanic Colonel in the
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:34.020]  military he was a head of the temple of set right now army psyops commander was
[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:37.500]  an open satanist yeah yes and he he wouldn't there all kinds of allegations
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:42.260]  against them and charges against them from sexually abusing satanically
[02:03:42.260 --> 02:03:46.380]  children at the Presidio army base right in San Francisco and Dietrich was
[02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:50.620]  worked with Aquino and he claims that he in fact you know Aquino was in fact
[02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:55.860]  involved in that ring and satanic abuse of children and he said and Dietrich said
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:01.700]  said to me that Aquino told him that they had unleashed the British Empire and
[02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:06.380]  unleashed certain demons in the course of John Dee's reign with Britain with the
[02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:09.500]  Queen Elizabeth John Dee was one of the top counselors to Queen Elizabeth the
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:13.260]  be really the originator of the British intelligence services of the modern era
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:18.020]  Dee as we know and you know and his partner Kelly were very involved in
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:23.900]  in magic rituals and practices these guys Aquino and whatnot the satanic crew
[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:28.060]  now said that they unleashed demons on the British Empire for the British Empire
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:31.180]  to expand to make deals with these demons basically for the British Empire to
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:35.020]  have its power and technology and as a result the Americans now are using those
[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:38.780]  same demons and they're trying to keep feeding them with more wars and more
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:45.220]  blood in order to maintain their power and control so whether that's in
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:48.300]  reality true or not these people believe they're being given basically
[02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:53.060]  extraterrestrial beyond human advanced intelligence advice and that goes back

[02:08:17.340 --> 02:08:22.780]  living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles the
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:28.140]  poor and the underclass are growing racial justice and human rights are
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:34.420]  non-existent they have created a repressive society and we are there
[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:40.420]  unwitting accomplices their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of
[02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:46.820]  consciousness we have been loaned with friends they have made us indifferent to
[02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:54.900]  ourselves to others we are focused only on our own game keep us asleep keep us
[02:08:54.900 --> 02:09:00.580]  selfish keep us sedated they are dismantling the sleeping middle class
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:07.380]  more and more people are becoming poor we are their cattle we are being bred
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:14.580]  for slavery they want benign indifference they want us drugged we
[02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:20.820]  could be pets we could be food but all we really are is lifestyle he aligns
[02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:26.540]  himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening
[02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:30.060]  to Alex Jones
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:40.180]  all right folks we're brought in a little bit of the theme music from they
[02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:46.860]  live the really good part is where it goes dum-dum-dum but I tell you it is
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:51.380]  one of my favorite all-time movies and it really gets you to think outside the
[02:09:51.380 --> 02:09:56.020]  box and of course I grew up watching them on television as well it's super
[02:09:56.020 --> 02:10:02.500]  exciting to have Rowdy Roddy Piper on with us today from Los Angeles there in
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:07.100]  Sean Stone's living room both guys are with us and you know it's great I've
[02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:09.740]  gotten to be good friends with Jesse Ventura and I know these two guys are
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:13.780]  friends as well or have been in the past and so now I get to talk to both of them
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:20.020]  and mr. Piper a formerly of course a born Roderick George tombs it is great to
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:24.140]  have you on the worldwide broadcast sir thank you very much for having me
[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:28.580]  would you mind just introducing me every place I go
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:34.220]  well it's great to have you on I tell you so much is happening in the world
[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:38.460]  but let's get into they live you've been in a lot of movies but what's your take
[02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:48.380]  on the 25th anniversary of they live it's really interesting the the movie they
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:55.700]  live when it was made was more about Reaganomics at the time but with the as
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:11:01.500]  the music lulls you to sleep conspiracies one of the things that the movie
[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:07.900]  has done is it's taken on a life of its own it never gets old as we see the
[02:11:07.900 --> 02:11:14.260]  world evolve and try to make us a little chip the same things happening over
[02:11:14.260 --> 02:11:18.460]  and over again you watch they live and it gives you comments kind of like the
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:23.980]  cliff notes for what's going on well it certainly is I mean you've got the part
[02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:29.660]  where the drone flies over you you go hello there my little friend and now
[02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:34.900]  I've actually videotaped drones twice in Austin watching people at the park now
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:41.100]  I'm actually living and they live and then this is an awkward place to live
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:49.580]  of the honest with you the you know John Carpenter when we shot this scene with
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:53.500]  the homeless people he actually used the homeless people there John is a big
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:58.940]  activist you know and I give him all the respect in the world for that and you
[02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:03.340]  know turning out and showing what the world become I don't know why America
[02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:08.780]  has homeless people it's it's terrible but also another thing we had to do was
[02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:13.420]  pay off the gang so they wouldn't come and wreck our trailer so there was you
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:21.340]  know little conspiracy little gangs for warfare then there would be the homeless
[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:27.460]  people we take care of and it really became a venture of love to a certain
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:33.620]  point and trying to do the right thing again I give all credit to John on that
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:44.180]  what is your favorite part of the film not the fight that's a long fight my
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:52.540]  favorite part of the film I think when the character nada looks out and he says
[02:12:52.540 --> 02:13:00.340]  I believe in America I think that's probably the biggest statement of the
[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:05.620]  entire movie one thing for this is when we would go to press conferences you
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:09.220]  know if you happen to be wearing something like a Rolex we took it off or
[02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:14.260]  you know we'd drawn an eyeball drive Cadillacs try to buy America buy American
[02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:21.980]  and keep the country safe and in that shot you had all the skyline of Los
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:27.460]  Angeles and the character nada which means nothing obviously which means
[02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:33.820]  nothing the thing that you that was interesting with nada staring over the
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:38.180]  LA skyline was you didn't know anything about him you didn't know where he came
[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:41.860]  from he wore a wedding ring you didn't know why you didn't know where he was
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:47.580]  going he's he's that lost America wandering around and he still looks out
[02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:52.980]  over the skyline of Los Angeles and he said a very profound statement I believe
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:58.860]  in America I do too absolutely you know one of my favorite lines is because I
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:02.020]  feel like this all the time trying to politically awaken people that they're
[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:05.620]  being lied to that there's an agenda that's not left or right it's hey
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:10.180]  there's mind control going on the signals broadcast 24 hours a day through
[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:14.020]  all this media just become aware of it and they'll say there's nothing going on
[02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:24.340]  and I want to say put on these glasses or start chewing concrete by the way I'm
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:30.460]  a big booster of you I've watched some of your your taking care of America and
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:34.660]  watched in a hotel room while the buzzing was going on and I think you do a
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:40.340]  terrific job this is this is the kind of thing that needs to be exposed to America
[02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:44.820]  they need to know you know they're trying to put us to sleep I'm a born rebel I
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:51.260]  can't I can't help myself I think Sean might be too rowdy rowdy Roddy Piper is a
[02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:58.060]  born rebel you got to be kidding oh yes yes that's added but and you know I've
[02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:05.060]  got four children all born here in America I've got two son-in-laws one of
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:10.420]  my son-in-laws is captain in the army been wounded twice my other son was a
[02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:14.300]  green beret you know what with they live in the mind control and everything
[02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:19.420]  that's going on there's one thing that that can escape people if you don't have
[02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:24.860]  somebody personal to you that has been harmed by not only by the conspiracies
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:29.300]  and all the tributaries that lead to that I run off that if you don't have
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:33.340]  someone close to you shaking at night time because he got blown up twice went
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:39.980]  over again got blown up two times then it doesn't mean so much to you you know
[02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:44.660]  every time we want to go to war would send your boy war my boys already been
[02:15:44.660 --> 02:15:49.900]  there and it and it becomes with the mind control trying to dumb down the
[02:15:49.900 --> 02:15:57.100]  society uh drugging society putting stuff I mean it is a it's a major major
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:02.220]  conspiracy for a new world order it's no doubt about it in my excuse me in my
[02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:07.740]  humble opinion there's no doubt about it that the world is trying to evolve into
[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:12.500]  something rowdy rowdy rowdy Piper I'm sorry interrupted what do you think it's
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:21.300]  what do you think you're trying to evolve it into well this again I respect
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:27.660]  you and what you're doing in Sean and your opinions are much none of them we
[02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:30.700]  want to know yours don't be humble sir okay we know but you're much more
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:35.700]  educated on this than I am and I don't want this is too serious I don't want
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:42.740]  to this is just my humble opinion sure the world has to go someplace okay we've
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:49.340]  got so many countries around the world fighting that the world has to get
[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:53.620]  together in some kind of way in some kind of fashion instead of killing people
[02:16:53.620 --> 02:17:01.780]  killing children for oil um I had one that one idea that crossed my mind was
[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:07.060]  as soon as they let us see the aliens we'll all get together because it'll be
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:13.460]  us against them and you need some kind of shock value like that either that or
[02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:20.340]  we're going to self-destruct I think that in in all cultures people are
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:25.740]  basically very good-hearted it's just the extremists or the people that are
[02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:32.260]  running and pushing the buttons I think that they want one governmental force
[02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:38.580]  to to govern govern the world it's just there everybody's got their own
[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:45.100]  agenda you can't get that done unless Gandhi's around you can't you you we
[02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:49.780]  can't get everybody on the same page well another idea is if we all spoke the
[02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:55.340]  same language it'd be kind of cool because of the communication is gone and
[02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:59.260]  then we can't tell when they say obey you know we were mad at Russia for how
[02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:03.420]  long but if I've been there and they're pretty nice people they don't want to
[02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:08.660]  over the Cuban missile crisis if you go back and look at it Russia didn't want
[02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:14.860]  to start a nuclear war pretty good people around the world so what is the
[02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:21.020]  world trying to evolve to we have so many different people and there's zero
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:26.740]  population is not has not happened yet and we're growing and growing like China
[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:32.340]  what are you doing China the thing in Syria what's China doing why we sending
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:38.740]  our boys somebody else send it at boys what's the UN doing so what what what do
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:42.540]  I believe is trying to happen I believe that a lot of people with their own
[02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:49.580]  agendas are trying to come around and make one government to govern the entire
[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:53.060]  world and there's some things are going to have to do we all got to speak the
[02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:57.420]  same language and we all got to be sincere about what's going on and not so
[02:18:57.420 --> 02:19:02.100]  greedy absolutely because you can have the Star Trek idea of a one-world
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:06.380]  government everybody's nice the problem is the people running the global
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:10.340]  government are not nice people and they want control
[02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:14.580]  basically I use the they live analogy we'll come back to break and get your
[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:20.580]  take on this both of you as the globalists are like psychopaths that
[02:19:20.580 --> 02:19:23.700]  are building a psychopathic world government so the allegory of them
[02:19:23.700 --> 02:19:27.580]  being space aliens and they live is absolutely accurate because these aren't
[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:32.580]  like regular people and they punch our emotional buttons they punch our human
[02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:36.820]  buttons to cold-bloodily control us so how do we learn how the psychopaths
[02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:41.140]  operate so we're aware of their tricks so as good people we can come together and
[02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:45.060]  not blow the planet up we're gonna come right back with our amazing guest both

[02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:50.100]  currently we were talking about globalism the new world order the things
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:56.260]  that are happening do you have hope for your children and your your grandchildren
[02:25:56.260 --> 02:26:03.580]  I guess I'm the only ones got children between the two of us I'm actually I'm
[02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:09.460]  a little afraid for my for my my youngest I've got four children most
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:16.780]  beautiful children in the world in my opinion and the youngest just going to
[02:26:16.780 --> 02:26:23.420]  PSU to become a doctor and they're all over this kind of thing she's very
[02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:29.860]  aware Fallon as my youngest 18 years old she's very aware of what's going on in
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:38.380]  the world the internet you know I'm from the generation before computers and the
[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:45.820]  internet's got so much information that the thing is the kids that they're
[02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:52.180]  targeting the kids and they're telling them how to think they're dumbing them
[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:57.020]  down in school for instance when my kids were in school they had like no paper
[02:26:57.020 --> 02:27:01.780]  days they didn't have paper to write on because of a shortage or they pull the
[02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:08.900]  teachers and that's a real heat getter for a dad who makes a living wrestling
[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:13.660]  with his body to when I go to feed my family and all of a sudden you've got a
[02:27:13.660 --> 02:27:20.700]  school that has no paper for my kids so why do you have no place see it all it
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:26.380]  all starts with the kids and as you get older and a little wiser you're harder
[02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:33.820]  to fool but you put up another pop idol for the kids put up put up another
[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:42.220]  piece of music that maybe isn't it was nothing but vulgarity for the kids you
[02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:47.300]  know bang it into them you know I can remember I think you know the Brunswick
[02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:51.820]  affair probably Alan oh yes yeah and for those who don't know about the Brunswick
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:56.820]  affair very quickly about I think in early 60s they had a TV called the
[02:27:56.820 --> 02:28:01.860]  Brunswick and the people that bought it dad would go to work mom would be there
[02:28:01.860 --> 02:28:07.140]  and dad would come back home and all of a sudden she bought 20 pounds of dog food
[02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:11.420]  but they don't have a dog and they found out that there was a little button in a
[02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:15.860]  TV called the Brunswick and when the commercials came on they did something
[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:22.180]  that shot out these waves and made you buy that's in the early 60s can you
[02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:28.820]  imagine how sophisticated they are now holy cow so if they had that kind of
[02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:35.820]  mind control back then the reason I don't I think that I'm not I'm not a good
[02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:41.420]  case study for them is because I I was a born gypsy I don't really have there's
[02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:48.500]  no place to halter me and I'm not afraid to speak out they but but they're my
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:52.780]  children and you say what do I worry about my children and I have five
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:57.500]  grandchildren and I'm very worried about them because the earth is not stable
[02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:02.420]  right now absolutely because it's being run by control freak psychopaths that
[02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:06.940]  might as well be space aliens from other planet and you raise the whole point
[02:29:06.940 --> 02:29:11.220]  about mind control in the 40s they would put subliminal ads in movie theaters
[02:29:11.220 --> 02:29:16.180]  and double sales of Coca-Cola and now it's so much more high-tech and it's
[02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:20.260]  working on the zombified public but there is a minority that it actually has
[02:29:20.260 --> 02:29:23.660]  the opposite effect on it I want to talk about that in the long segment when we
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:28.180]  come up back and also open the phones up for questions on they live for mr.
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:32.460]  Piper and mr. Stone 25th anniversary but here's the big question when we come
[02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:40.500]  back rowdy why why are we somewhat immune why does the propaganda only
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:45.700]  irritate us why does the signal only make us get angry and more awake what is
[02:29:45.700 --> 02:29:49.660]  different from us than the general zombified public we'll be right back

[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:21.780]  there is mr. piper right there on our screen so so sir you heard the question
[02:34:21.780 --> 02:34:26.780]  before the break dealing with the nature of reality dealing with you know all the
[02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:33.060]  points that are being yeah I basically put out there by the media what do you
[02:34:33.060 --> 02:34:36.540]  think at the bottom of the rabbit hole what do you think's really going on and
[02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:47.100]  dovetailing it with they live um right so many variables first woman as just
[02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:51.980]  before the break you're saying I why does it why does it control some people
[02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:58.420]  and why does somebody like myself or maybe Sean it doesn't control and with
[02:34:58.420 --> 02:35:03.420]  they live the character nada was based very much on my life I don't come from
[02:35:03.420 --> 02:35:08.100]  any place I thought I was born in a place called Saskatoon Saskatchewan coldest
[02:35:08.100 --> 02:35:12.900]  place on earth and I was moved all over the world till I was 13 and I went out
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:19.420]  by myself and then I got into a business with no rules pro wrestling at 15 no
[02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:22.940]  rules at all you could do the only the only thing is you know you have to
[02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:31.980]  survive it so I was I wasn't raised under the institution I wasn't there to
[02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:35.580]  program every day they've got you know they gotta hit you every day I
[02:35:35.580 --> 02:35:40.580]  understand on the signs but in my particular case my job was to make you
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:46.220]  angry and so I was doing a lot of subliminal things in my interviews and
[02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:53.060]  from my own business I know what it is to control somebody it's like when they
[02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:59.300]  when the radio first came out and people that would sit by the radio and
[02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:03.900]  like when now what was it see biscuit would listen to the razor or Joe Lewis
[02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:11.220]  was smell a match smelling cat man with other guys name boxing yeah they would
[02:36:11.220 --> 02:36:16.900]  all tune into the radio because it was like this unbelievable device and then
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:22.780]  when television came on the one of the hottest shows was pro wrestling because
[02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:29.860]  it was easily produced and it's an international language but within my
[02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:34.580]  ranks there are no rules so you can't program me and then once you get a
[02:36:34.580 --> 02:36:38.900]  little older and I've seen people that are programmed you learn how they do
[02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:43.220]  that and it becomes evident that the different things that they do in the
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:47.980]  government questions are not allowed to ask Jesse Ventura is a good friend of
[02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:59.980]  mine then a tag team partner and Jesse told me they gave Jesse a lot of they
[02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:05.580]  wanted to know how Jesse got to be governor and the Jesse himself that
[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:09.460]  told me about a situation he got into where these government officials came
[02:37:09.460 --> 02:37:15.580]  and took him underground and started asking questions they just didn't
[02:37:15.580 --> 02:37:22.780]  realize Jesse's not afraid and Jesse Ventura lives in Mexico I talked to him
[02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:29.460]  as often as I can so Jesse's not a programmable guy either I'm Sean I
[02:37:29.460 --> 02:37:34.300]  don't absolutely a governor is going to be on the 27th before he starts his
[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:40.100]  whole mediator in the month of October very excited he's got a new book on JFK
[02:37:40.100 --> 02:37:43.860]  coming out and I think you just answered my question there that I said at the
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:47.740]  beginning of the break and I was going to reintroduce what makes those of us
[02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:52.380]  that are immune or resistant to the programming and I think it's that we
[02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:57.020]  grew up as individuals and we grew up and had a brush with the streets I grew
[02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:59.980]  up in a middle-class area but for whatever reason there was a lot of
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:04.260]  fights a lot of corrupt police government drug dealing a lot of police
[02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:09.060]  running hookers you name it and I grew up you know watching this going on in my
[02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:13.100]  neighborhood and then watching the same cops give speeches against drug use at
[02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:16.180]  school and I called them out and they threatened to kill me and stuff but I
[02:38:16.180 --> 02:38:20.780]  think that was kind of my wake-up was I put the sunglasses on because I saw the
[02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:25.340]  other side and saw how naive everybody is and I think you said it best they
[02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:29.500]  want to get the youth dumb them down make it all a bunch of political
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:33.420]  correctness to where the kids don't even know how to make a sandwich they
[02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:36.100]  they're not allowed to get in a fistfight to learn how to defend
[02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:39.900]  themselves they're not allowed to play dodgeball they're not all they're at
[02:38:39.900 --> 02:38:43.220]  school till eight o'clock now because parents got to work two jobs they are
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:50.660]  attacking our basic humanity because a basic human is not gonna be a slave you
[02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:54.020]  know how it was interesting I'm listening to how the discourse is always
[02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:58.820]  they right and the funny thing is they live who is they people always say who
[02:38:58.820 --> 02:39:01.700]  is they you know the conspiracy theorists we're always saying they and what
[02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:04.500]  what's interesting about what you're saying and what Rodden said what Rodden
[02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:08.820]  was saying all of us I think come across this this corruption at some point
[02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:12.500]  in our lives right and it's it's not just the fact of traveling is amazing
[02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:15.540]  obviously when you get a brush with the streets it's amazing but in the day we
[02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:18.220]  all come across corruption we all see the corruption of the police force we all
[02:39:18.220 --> 02:39:22.540]  see corruption in schools in our own family right the question is do we go
[02:39:22.540 --> 02:39:25.740]  along to get along or do we start to point it out now those of us who are
[02:39:25.740 --> 02:39:29.580]  not going more inclined to adjust this whatnot we want to see the good thing
[02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:33.740]  happen but there's still this this factor in the film that we haven't talked
[02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:38.420]  about yet and that is there are sociopaths there are people this part of
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:41.980]  the population that are that are that have no emotion they are not human and
[02:39:41.980 --> 02:39:45.460]  I think the human race that has not yet come in terms of the fact there are as
[02:39:45.460 --> 02:39:50.300]  10% the population that are sociopathic that do not have human emotion or
[02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:53.900]  boundaries and they are not human so when we say hey we'll give them a pass
[02:39:53.900 --> 02:39:58.700]  he's human hey he can you know he made a mistake we're not understanding that
[02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:02.300]  the fundamental thing that they were talking about is a small percentage of
[02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:08.820]  the population that does not care about humanity they live we sleep rowdy what's
[02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:13.540]  your take on why you've been immune to their programming and why some people
[02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:17.540]  are born with the glasses on or have them on pretty early and other people it
[02:40:17.540 --> 02:40:22.580]  seems are just born to be slaves to the sociopaths and the psychopaths that are
[02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:35.180]  1% of the population that run them oh it's a good question you have to be you
[02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:42.020]  have to live within the system to be programmed you they have to at least get
[02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:49.260]  to you your senses in some way and if they don't know where you are and they
[02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:54.100]  don't know like I didn't have an until I was 19 years old nobody knew I was a
[02:40:54.100 --> 02:40:58.620]  lie I didn't have a social security number I didn't have any passport I
[02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:05.220]  didn't have anything and so I was his kid that would do whatever I needed to do
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:10.260]  that the guys the the older pro wrestlers would tell me to do how did you
[02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:17.180]  fall into wrestling at a record age of 14 record young age 15 I was I lived on
[02:41:17.180 --> 02:41:22.900]  the street for two years and I was staying at a youth hostel and the youth
[02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:28.980]  hostel was a YMCA and I was the 167 amateur wrestling champion and a box and
[02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:35.540]  somebody just didn't show up in Winnipeg at the matches and my amateur
[02:41:35.540 --> 02:41:39.940]  wrestling coach was a referee he says I can get you 25 bucks if you want to
[02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:43.940]  fight this guy but you lose your amateur status I'd never seen a pro wrestling
[02:41:43.940 --> 02:41:48.260]  match in my life but I came fifth in the world playing the bagpipes and I went to
[02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:54.820]  my band and I said what's going on they said we'll play in four bagpipers a
[02:41:54.820 --> 02:42:00.100]  bass drummer with the big furly hat two snares and me come walking in and I don't
[02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:05.700]  know if you remember Mr. Perfect oh yeah yeah well it was his dad Larry the
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:11.060]  accenting man you know still saw dust on the floor and he didn't much like my
[02:42:11.060 --> 02:42:14.780]  entrance is the shortest match in the history of the Winnipeg arena he beat
[02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:20.300]  me in 10 seconds and when I was back then it was like real wrestling it wasn't
[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:25.540]  just like ballet oh no no there's this kid coming with all these bagpipers and
[02:42:25.540 --> 02:42:31.380]  he was a top guy and he just took me in and beat me those he broke my nose
[02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:36.260]  split my eye open and they came and said kid you did great how'd you like to go
[02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:41.020]  to San Francisco they put me in a van and snuck me over the border and I
[02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:46.020]  rolled every day until I was 19 in the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles and
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:50.140]  they finally got me a green card you know they ought to make a movie about you
[02:42:50.140 --> 02:42:53.980]  what you think of the movie the wrestler what did I think of the movie the
[02:42:53.980 --> 02:43:01.020]  wrestler um it's one of those things that like what they live with the
[02:43:01.020 --> 02:43:06.580]  conspiracies you know and tying that all in you know you gotta go you gotta go
[02:43:06.580 --> 02:43:11.980]  deep you have to have the courage to dive in and the faith and with the
[02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:16.900]  wrestler I give Mickey Rourke you know thumbs up for portraying the character
[02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:21.460]  but you just give him the surface you don't understand real programming nor
[02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:28.860]  how ugly how ugly that gets day after day after day so wrestling I mean
[02:43:28.860 --> 02:43:32.100]  wrestling in the early days was also I mean was people a lot of times actually
[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:35.500]  fighting and then I guess it's segwayed because of all the injuries into
[02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:41.580]  something that was more stylized yeah kind of it let me just give you I don't
[02:43:41.580 --> 02:43:46.380]  know if this applies but let me try when I was like 17 years old there was this
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:51.460]  promoter and when you got in get paid the old timers would tell me yeah you
[02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:56.860]  held out your hands and the first thing he put in was $10 of quarters and he
[02:43:56.860 --> 02:44:01.620]  would look at you and then he'd put a $5 bill and you'd look at you and if you
[02:44:01.620 --> 02:44:07.540]  smiled you'd stop so they would tell me don't smile because he would program
[02:44:07.540 --> 02:44:13.340]  you if you ever had a clicker to go into the arena because you used to get paid
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:19.100]  by the house you'd be fired if you ask questions about how much money was
[02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:24.140]  being drawn you'd be fired in blackball it's total control well I've been
[02:44:24.140 --> 02:44:31.020]  blackballed five times doesn't bother me anymore because there's a lot of guys
[02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:35.420]  in my sport that don't have the opportunity to be on a wonderful show
[02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:40.540]  like this that you can speak your mind and I think that there's a lot of people
[02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:46.300]  just around the world that are very confused because you can't just they
[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:49.740]  can't just pinpoint what it is and that's where I come to people like
[02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:55.620]  yourself Alex and Sean a little bit of renegade and not the kind of people you
[02:44:55.620 --> 02:44:59.500]  know I don't like to be told what to do but at the same time I like to try to do
[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:04.620]  the right thing absolutely wow well Rowdy Roddy Piper is our guest with Sean
[02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:08.580]  Stone and we've only got like 15 mental shows over we'll take you guys right to
[02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:12.460]  the end of you can do it I want to take some phone calls Rowdy you ready to take
[02:45:12.460 --> 02:45:17.940]  some calls you betcha all right let's go to will in Georgia you're on the air
[02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:23.140]  with the legendary star of they live go ahead thanks Alex that's a great movie
[02:45:23.140 --> 02:45:27.980]  Rowdy you did a good job I was a true ministry on the late they live I
[02:45:27.980 --> 02:45:32.660]  actually married into the Bay part of they live the control the New York LA
[02:45:32.660 --> 02:45:36.620]  Sodom and Gomorrah Access Hollywood Babylon and they taught my kids every
[02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:40.140]  morning on Saturday during worship services that everybody wasn't part of
[02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:44.220]  their tribe was subhuman animals a cattle just like I said in the movie that
[02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:48.580]  there and they actually put that I mean that the preacher the rabbi would tell
[02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:52.780]  them that your job growing up and from birth they told them this is to cheat
[02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:58.420]  right to rob and slave and kill all the Gentiles listen do you have a you have
[02:45:58.420 --> 02:46:04.460]  a specific question sir well not just we're weak America is our focus has to
[02:46:04.460 --> 02:46:07.060]  be on the Creator who's named the sovereign of the United States the
[02:46:07.060 --> 02:46:10.860]  creative universe listen I appreciate your call we've got questions or
[02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:14.580]  comments for our guest we don't screen calls so sometimes it becomes a soapbox
[02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:18.900]  but there are always subgroups within any culture that teach that we're the best
[02:46:18.900 --> 02:46:22.060]  everybody else when we look what we say about the Arabs when we go invade and
[02:46:22.060 --> 02:46:25.220]  attack them and then you know what happened to the American Indians I mean
[02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:28.860]  this is something that goes through cultures everywhere but I mean I guess
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:33.300]  the movie they live does speak to class stratos but I think it's about more
[02:46:33.300 --> 02:46:37.980]  about individuals being psychopaths and sociopaths about how they could be black
[02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:40.420]  they could be white they could be German they could be Jewish they could be
[02:46:40.420 --> 02:46:46.900]  Chinese there are people genetically I think who really aren't human I was
[02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:50.220]  gonna ask I should want to ask Rowdy that because I'm you know I'm really
[02:46:50.220 --> 02:46:53.900]  curious to know where that story came from because carpenter wrote it and I
[02:46:53.900 --> 02:46:57.180]  mean and you're he must you know in your interaction with it if any I'm sure
[02:46:57.180 --> 02:47:00.020]  you came across some interesting discussions as to what he thought you
[02:47:00.020 --> 02:47:03.420]  know who would who they really are and if does he really believe that they that
[02:47:03.420 --> 02:47:10.580]  they are alien yeah who is they exactly yeah at that time in 88 I think it came
[02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:19.940]  on 88 they was the propaganda the world was shoving down our throats but John
[02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:27.500]  and I we talked a lot before we made this movie I took it real serious and you
[02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:33.660]  know I don't want to speak for John but just the way I remember it is again I'm
[02:47:33.660 --> 02:47:42.260]  I don't think that we're the only I don't think we're the only living source of
[02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:49.060]  energy in the universe by any means at all and there's big committees right
[02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:56.020]  now getting together and saying talking about people are excuse me things from
[02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:59.940]  other planets aliens whatever you want to call them tall whites grays reptiles
[02:47:59.940 --> 02:48:06.700]  and we weren't that detailed with it but John and I both agreed that we don't
[02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:11.580]  think we're alone in the universe and I think that I ran across a doctor friend
[02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:16.940]  of mine who didn't agree with me at all and I found that amazing that an
[02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:22.660]  educated man like that would not would not see that far but maybe you know what
[02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:27.060]  maybe I'm the crazy one I don't know there well also speaking of speaking of
[02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:31.420]  Mr. Carpenter who I would love to get on a fan of his work as well obviously his
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:38.100]  1980 whatever year it was the thing with Kurt Russell is so good I mean that is
[02:48:38.100 --> 02:48:47.940]  another amazing film big time John made a lot of a lot of films together
[02:48:47.940 --> 02:48:53.580]  just a little daily of note the last Kurt Russell film I think with John was
[02:48:53.580 --> 02:48:58.060]  big trouble little China oh yeah Kurt was driving the semi with sunglasses on
[02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:02.580]  well after that movie was finished they had all those sunglasses left that's the
[02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:07.900]  sunglasses you see and they live you know there's a little levity as we're going
[02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:13.860]  along here rule in the world you know it's all about budget but the story for

[02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:42.700]  clip Rush Limbaugh came out today and said he thinks it's a false flag attack

[02:55:05.860 --> 02:55:12.260]  you make Mr. Piper about having like all these mainstream people now say they
[02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:16.980]  think the whole thing in Syria staged by the rebels there's video of it I mean
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:20.940]  it's just it's amazing to see everything we've talked about Sean Stone and I and
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:26.460]  others is now just mainstream I do you think the world is putting on the black
[02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:35.340]  sunglasses more and more? Holy cow I think that I think the world you know
[02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:40.580]  what I think I think that I think the world the real men of the world have to
[02:55:40.580 --> 02:55:47.260]  stand up and say I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass and I'm all
[02:55:47.260 --> 02:55:53.940]  out of bubblegum. Time to take a stand boys you know what you got a little
[02:55:53.940 --> 02:55:59.540]  courage stand up for yourself baby Jesus all bunch of sniveling winers and
[02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:04.660]  over in Syria like I'm not qualified I just know like who are you gonna send
[02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:10.340]  over there why don't the Chinese how what is the UN doing and I saw those
[02:56:10.340 --> 02:56:16.540]  pictures I'm not qualified but I got four kids and I got real angry now
[02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:19.860]  they're trying to punch our buttons but man Rush Limbaugh coming out saying it's
[02:56:19.860 --> 02:56:25.460]  a false flag wow I mean it's a ratings ploy yeah who knows Sean that's a pretty
[02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:30.060]  big deal isn't it? That's a huge deal of Limbaugh saying it which probably gives
[02:56:30.060 --> 02:56:34.380]  curious to the fact that you know how can you sell the idea of the Assad
[02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:37.580]  government using chemical weapons when it's been leaked for months that the US
[02:56:37.580 --> 02:56:40.940]  has been trying to sell chemical weapons and send them there as a fault for a
[02:56:40.940 --> 02:56:44.020]  false flag purpose I mean it's almost like the conspiracies becoming more and
[02:56:44.020 --> 02:56:48.300]  more flagrant in advance right people are can see it coming the stories
[02:56:48.300 --> 02:56:52.220]  reported so you can't you know it's hard to keep it contained what are you
[02:56:52.220 --> 02:56:55.460]  gonna do? Listen I don't want to hog the show we got like three minutes left

[02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:19.820]  hey gentlemen and they live they had the underground tunnel system underground
[02:57:19.820 --> 02:57:25.100]  base system my question is some people think that Denver International is like
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:28.740]  some super secret base space port whatever you guys want to call there's
[02:57:28.740 --> 02:57:32.900]  giant underground bases everywhere yeah yeah so I mean I guess my question is do
[02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:36.700]  you think it's you know like the movie they say it's almost like aliens just I
[02:57:36.700 --> 02:57:39.700]  mean I guess Rowdy already answered that but does he think that you know does he
[02:57:39.700 --> 02:57:43.580]  put two and two together like that? I know exactly what you're talking about in Denver
[02:57:43.580 --> 02:57:51.500]  and that they had a huge portrait from like the Holocaust to chemical weapons
[02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:55.060]  and then they took the picture down so I understand what you're saying again they
[02:57:55.060 --> 02:58:01.580]  they you need to stand up against they and I yes yes the answer coming into
[02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:06.180]  that tunnel it's like where the Illuminati have their meetings anything
