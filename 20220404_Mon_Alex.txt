[00:00.000 --> 00:03.620]  We have the globalist statements, we have their white papers and now we have them putting
[00:03.620 --> 00:05.120]  it into action.
[00:05.120 --> 00:11.720]  100% the multinational megabanks headed up with BlackRock and Vanguard and the private
[00:11.720 --> 00:16.240]  Federal Reserve have set China up to replace the United States and to be an authoritarian
[00:16.240 --> 00:19.720]  model of technocracy and global cashless society.
[00:19.720 --> 00:26.840]  China is the most popular country in the world and it is the second largest economy and in
[00:26.840 --> 00:33.920]  terms of its influence politically, it belongs among the superpowers.
[00:33.920 --> 00:42.400]  So it is accurately described as a key country of the international order.
[00:42.400 --> 00:50.360]  We are 100% now being maneuvered into and we're now entering the official phase of the
[00:50.360 --> 00:51.840]  end of the dollar.
[00:51.840 --> 01:00.240]  Over the coming next year to two years, the dollar as far as being the linchpin to global
[01:00.240 --> 01:10.480]  trade and the key currency for all commodity trade and global trade is likely to start
[01:10.480 --> 01:19.040]  to erode given a lot of the changes that we're seeing, not only in the trade landscape but
[01:19.040 --> 01:23.240]  also what we're seeing in the development of blockchain cryptocurrency and central bank
[01:23.240 --> 01:24.920]  digital currencies.
[01:24.920 --> 01:28.400]  What underpins a world order is always the financial system.
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.240]  We're about to abandon the traditional system of money and accounting and introduce a new
[01:33.240 --> 01:34.240]  one.
[01:34.240 --> 01:38.760]  And the new one, the new accounting is what we call blockchain.
[01:38.760 --> 01:45.440]  It means digital, it means having a almost perfect record of every single transaction
[01:45.440 --> 01:50.160]  that happens in the economy which will give us far greater clarity over what's going
[01:50.160 --> 01:51.160]  on.
[01:51.160 --> 01:56.080]  It also raises huge dangers in terms of the balance of power between states and citizens
[01:56.080 --> 02:01.040]  and my opinion we're going to need a digital constitution of human rights if we're going
[02:01.040 --> 02:03.360]  to have digital money.
[02:03.360 --> 02:07.960]  But also this new money will be sovereign in nature.
[02:07.960 --> 02:14.160]  Most people think that digital money is crypto and private but what I see are superpowers
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.760]  introducing digital currency.
[02:16.760 --> 02:18.840]  The Chinese were the first.
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.040]  The US is on the brink I think of moving in the same direction, the Europeans have committed
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.040]  to that as well.
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.120]  Now, for folks that aren't into the economy and into economics and into currencies and
[02:28.120 --> 02:35.200]  into what that means, this country will look like Venezuela in just a couple years if this
[02:35.200 --> 02:37.120]  actually happens.
[02:37.120 --> 02:42.040]  We will look like Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic Germany and that's all we had left was a giant
[02:42.040 --> 02:49.320]  military and the fact that we had the world reserve currency, all of the major banks
[02:49.320 --> 02:55.920]  and the CIA and the entire federal government at the top is doing exactly what you do to
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.440]  burn down the US economy and shut us down and use the economic warfare on us.
[03:00.440 --> 03:04.480]  Like if you wanted to burn down let's say an old farmhouse that you didn't even want
[03:04.480 --> 03:09.880]  to pay to have a demolition, you can wait till it's a rainy time there's no burn ban
[03:09.880 --> 03:14.280]  call the fire department out and burn that sucker down, that family burned down their
[03:14.280 --> 03:18.400]  old farmhouse that's cheaper than hauling it off, so they've been pouring gasoline all
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.160]  over the country for a long time and now they threw the match in, the match goes spinning
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.840]  through the air and in the last month it actually hit and now the house is engulfed
[03:26.840 --> 03:30.840]  in flame and it's going to burn to the ground and it's all been done by the sun, it's being
[03:30.840 --> 03:36.200]  heralded from BBC to Al Jazeera to the communist Chinese official daily.
[03:36.200 --> 03:41.680]  If we admit that they shipped in tons of fentanyl, they deliberately bankrupted the
[03:41.680 --> 03:46.920]  cities, they deliberately annihilated the family, they deliberately destroyed the border,
[03:46.920 --> 03:53.520]  they are absolutely publicly killing the dollar right now and let's just get it out there,
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.320]  the good old days are over.
[03:55.320 --> 04:12.760]  Is there any more locations in this one, there might be so many people out here, I want everybody
[04:12.760 --> 04:28.800]  in Washington who works for their people so we can house people, that's what I'm doing.
[04:28.800 --> 04:31.720]  Do you think the average leftist is going to say oh I was wrong and try to change their
[04:31.720 --> 04:36.520]  policies, no, they're going to get more desperate, more insane, more feverish demanding wealth
[04:36.520 --> 04:43.320]  redistribution by the government administered by BlackRock and others who are going to have
[04:43.320 --> 04:48.240]  the world social credit score system and the guaranteed universal basic income and make
[04:48.240 --> 04:54.240]  everyone quote shine on their wealth into a new digital global pool with China.
[04:54.240 --> 05:00.840]  So for this new global system to rise with China at the heart of it, America had to fall.
[05:00.840 --> 05:09.120]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[05:09.120 --> 05:15.160]  Coin and it sold out in 10 days and if it wasn't for listeners getting this original,
[05:15.160 --> 05:20.400]  powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[05:20.400 --> 05:25.720]  Now the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin is being offered and it will probably sell
[05:25.720 --> 05:27.760]  out in 10 days again.
[05:27.760 --> 05:33.040]  It certainly needs to to fund our operation, it is so historic and it has a quote from
[05:33.040 --> 05:37.240]  Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of Patriots
[05:37.240 --> 05:39.120]  and Tyrants and more.
[05:39.120 --> 05:46.360]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com, it's also at infowarstore.com, it's amazing,
[05:46.360 --> 05:50.880]  there's only 10,000 of them and as a founding member and we're able to stay on the air,
[05:50.880 --> 05:55.560]  we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next
[05:55.560 --> 05:56.560]  level.
[05:56.560 --> 06:00.560]  You can get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[06:00.560 --> 06:09.680]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[06:09.680 --> 06:14.520]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got
[06:14.520 --> 06:15.520]  one.
[06:15.520 --> 06:35.040]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:35.040 --> 06:59.680]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world.
[07:05.040 --> 07:16.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now in the times foretold of world government, pastoral societies,
[07:16.080 --> 07:27.000]  Margaret the Beast, nanotech, combat robots, massive, starving third world populations,
[07:27.000 --> 07:36.800]  open pedophilia and Satanism promoted by major government and media institutions.
[07:36.800 --> 07:42.720]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the new world order.
[07:42.720 --> 07:47.240]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, we're going to be live here for the next four hours, Paul
[07:47.240 --> 07:52.880]  Joseph Watson is going to be coming in, Owen Schreuer and so much more, I'm going to get
[07:52.880 --> 07:57.320]  on airplane here in a few hours and travel to Connecticut and I'll be telling you a
[07:57.320 --> 08:01.640]  little bit about that coming up as well here because it's very interesting to know the
[08:01.640 --> 08:06.920]  tactics of the establishment and its controllers.
[08:06.920 --> 08:12.720]  But wow, what a time to be alive, very good news is happening.
[08:12.720 --> 08:18.880]  We have Victor Orban, despite all the major leftist organizations throwing everything
[08:18.880 --> 08:25.880]  they had against him, the State Department, the New World Order, George Soros, despite
[08:25.880 --> 08:34.280]  all of that being thrown at them, he won by over 70%, just as you've seen with the other
[08:34.280 --> 08:38.200]  anti-globalists in Brazil, just as you've watched here with President Trump, they stole
[08:38.200 --> 08:43.720]  the election, this is happening all over the world, the case of Boris Johnson, he poses
[08:43.720 --> 08:47.680]  as a patriot and then later stabs people in the back, so you're going to have some people
[08:47.680 --> 08:52.000]  getting elected as pro-human anti-globalists, it will turn out to be globalists, but most
[08:52.000 --> 08:58.560]  of them have turned out to be very, very good, Bolsonaro I say is the best than Victor Orban
[08:58.560 --> 09:03.440]  and then of course Trump and then it goes down the line from there, but this is a major
[09:03.440 --> 09:11.880]  trend that signals the end of the New World Order, the order that's being run by the globalists
[09:11.880 --> 09:15.880]  that seeks the technocracy and the post-human world.
[09:15.880 --> 09:21.680]  People are really waking up too because they've just included a conference in Dubai headed
[09:21.680 --> 09:29.520]  up by the World Economic Forum titled World Government Summit with Klaus Schwab and Harari
[09:29.520 --> 09:37.960]  and others saying the end of humans is soon to be here, humans are no longer needed, you
[09:37.960 --> 09:44.320]  have no free will, these are quotes, the old quotes so you'll have nothing and own nothing
[09:44.320 --> 09:49.280]  and like it and eat bugs and drink sewage, those are real quotes, exact quotes, the new
[09:49.280 --> 09:57.080]  quotes we've been playing all last week are you have no free will, the days of believing
[09:57.080 --> 10:03.280]  you do are over, this is the New World Order, we will soon be in a post-human world, those
[10:03.280 --> 10:09.880]  of us that survive will be gods, all the rest of you will die, you are not needed, so that's
[10:09.880 --> 10:14.960]  what the ultra-rich are meeting and talking about and doing and saying that the global
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.800]  collapse is good for you to get you off of carbon and booty judge came out and said that
[10:20.800 --> 10:27.080]  as well over the weekend, we've got that club for you, they're rubbing our noses in it after
[10:27.080 --> 10:35.160]  decades of us warning you about the New World Order takeover plan, now they're openly saying
[10:35.160 --> 10:41.320]  world government and you're going to own nothing and have nothing, it's incredible, why are
[10:41.320 --> 10:44.680]  they doing it, well to rub our noses in it because they've got their censorship systems
[10:44.680 --> 10:49.360]  in place and they believe they can just gaslight everyone into just accepting this incredible
[10:49.360 --> 10:55.640]  dystopia like convicted pedophiles running drag queen story time or Disney saying they
[10:55.640 --> 11:02.600]  want leftist groups to have access to their children at age four to teach them quote the
[11:02.600 --> 11:07.560]  homosexual lifestyle, those are mainline quotes and it gets worse.
[11:07.560 --> 11:15.320]  The Supreme Court nominee, Katanji Brown Jackson, they've now released a bunch of transcripts
[11:15.320 --> 11:18.920]  on Friday, the news has tried to suppress them but finally it's in the New York Post
[11:18.920 --> 11:25.480]  of their areas, we covered it over the weekend, she chose leniency even in baby sex torture
[11:25.480 --> 11:33.440]  cases where grown men rape babies bloody and I don't mean to be so graphic here but she
[11:33.440 --> 11:40.440]  sees it as a sexual preference to want to rape babies bloody, this is a cult ladies
[11:40.440 --> 11:46.400]  and gentlemen, now there's new footage and photos that have been released via lawsuits
[11:46.400 --> 11:51.440]  by major pro life groups where they've gotten the videos and photos of the babies kept alive
[11:51.440 --> 11:56.360]  and the medical experiments done on them, other babies kept alive and then executed
[11:56.360 --> 12:00.920]  later tortured to death and we've got other footage even more sickening that I'm not
[12:00.920 --> 12:04.800]  going to air here but you can imagine the type of folks that want to do that with babies
[12:04.800 --> 12:10.400]  are obviously doing other things to defile them and to be blasphemers and to torture
[12:10.400 --> 12:18.800]  God, that is what all of this is and you want me to show you what they do to the babies,
[12:18.800 --> 12:22.880]  you know what I don't think we're going to show you but there's a lot of footage out
[12:22.880 --> 12:33.360]  and they have boxing matches with the dead babies, they do rituals with the dead babies,
[12:33.360 --> 12:38.240]  they have sex with the dead babies, different groups do different things and they make money
[12:38.240 --> 12:45.840]  off the babies after they're born and universities take delivery of babies while they're alive
[12:45.840 --> 12:49.280]  so I tell you about this stuff because you need to know the full horror of the enemy
[12:49.280 --> 12:56.400]  we're up against and of course Joe Biden who is a pedophile chieftain wants to put a woman
[12:56.400 --> 13:01.560]  in there who said well the 18 year old man has sex with an 8 year old, they're in the
[13:01.560 --> 13:08.760]  same age group so they shouldn't get in trouble and even said baby sex torture is something
[13:08.760 --> 13:16.680]  that people need leniency in, the sadomasochistic torture of young kids including infants and
[13:16.680 --> 13:33.640]  toddlers, infants and toddlers, isn't she nice but she's a black lady so it's okay and she
[13:33.640 --> 13:39.360]  doesn't have an anglophile first name so we've got to do whatever she wants, big stack on
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.760]  the Disney pedos right here we're going to be getting into today but the good news is
[13:44.760 --> 13:48.680]  the world is really starting to wake up to the new world order and as soon as people
[13:48.680 --> 13:52.520]  know what it is and know who they are and know that they're behind basically all our
[13:52.520 --> 14:00.040]  problems literally greasing the skids, creating them, setting up scams, running frauds, poisoning
[14:00.040 --> 14:06.200]  our minds, our souls, our bodies, as soon as the world gets this then the pain can stop
[14:06.200 --> 14:10.080]  massively, there'll still be corruption, there'll still be problems, there'll still be new cults
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.600]  and gangs and criminal groups to deal with but these people make James Bond villains
[14:15.600 --> 14:22.480]  look like boy scouts, they are Satanist in their own admitted operating system, you should
[14:22.480 --> 14:29.360]  go see Greg Reese's latest report about why they're targeting the union of men and women
[14:29.360 --> 14:36.320]  which is a holy union that God created that is so powerful and that important video is
[14:36.320 --> 14:40.840]  at man.video in the Greg Reese section, we're going to go to break, don't come back and
[14:40.840 --> 14:44.760]  get into the globalist economy, the latest Russian news, the latest COVID news, new documents
[14:44.760 --> 14:50.520]  released on that front even more damning than anyone knew, separately please remember that
[14:50.520 --> 14:55.800]  we are listeners supported and so many people call us wanting the George Washington slave
[14:55.800 --> 15:00.200]  to the dragon coin but there were only ten thousand made that will never be more made
[15:00.200 --> 15:04.240]  because it's a collector and it's a founding coin, there'll only be three in the series,
[15:04.240 --> 15:08.800]  the second will sell out the next four or five days at current sales rates, I want you
[15:08.800 --> 15:16.240]  to have one, it's the tree of liberty coin, it's just as powerful as the last coin, it
[15:16.240 --> 15:25.200]  is just as powerful as the original last coin and it is critical to funding our operation
[15:25.200 --> 15:35.560]  and keeping us on air, you can go to patricklectibles.com or 1776coin.com and you will find the coin
[15:35.560 --> 15:42.240]  there, it will again at current sales rates be gone by Friday, we will hold 250 back for
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.440]  special sales later just like we just did with the George Washington coin, there are
[15:46.440 --> 15:51.440]  now 50 of the George Washington coin left in our vault but the bulk of the new coin
[15:51.440 --> 15:56.840]  will be sold out by Friday, get yours at 1776coin.com, I want to thank all you that have got the

[16:05.880 --> 16:12.520]  2021 and sold out in ten days, now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into
[16:12.520 --> 16:19.200]  April 2022 is now being offered, I believe it will sell out in just a few days again

[19:20.880 --> 19:25.120]  And it's a research funding pause, it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition, it's when
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.000]  you come to a four way intersection, there's the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.800]  and then you proceed and so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected
[19:33.800 --> 19:38.520]  gain of function but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification
[19:38.520 --> 19:42.520]  research so you know Rand and others, you know maybe Fauci was right, they don't quite
[19:42.520 --> 19:45.520]  know what they're talking about, calling it gain of function, you know that's why he
[19:45.520 --> 19:47.840]  didn't perjure himself, that's why he hasn't been arrested.
[19:47.840 --> 19:52.280]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do
[19:52.280 --> 19:56.440]  but in the main definition it's still a gain of function, they're making something deadly
[19:56.440 --> 20:00.800]  that spreads more easily to hurt people, thank you Mike, we love you.
[20:00.800 --> 20:30.760]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today, I'm Alex
[20:30.760 --> 20:31.760]  Jones your host.
[20:31.760 --> 20:36.600]  Now before I hit all this horrible news, it's very very serious, in the next few segments
[20:36.600 --> 20:43.680]  I want to hit the positive news, Victor Orban in Hungary is a great patriot and the founding
[20:43.680 --> 20:49.640]  followers will be proud to know him, his policies, his leadership, his smashing corruption, his
[20:49.640 --> 20:55.960]  cutting taxes, his promoting the family, it's the kind of leaders we need and you know they've
[20:55.960 --> 21:00.160]  made the comments in the news, it's like Alex Jones is the president of Hungary.
[21:00.160 --> 21:05.680]  Well except he's more of a statesman and so, and I can tell you obviously Orban is a listener,
[21:05.680 --> 21:12.520]  I'll just leave it at that, so is Bolsonaro, so are all of them and I've had these guys
[21:12.520 --> 21:18.320]  tell me and tell others that it was America's awakening to the new world order and globalism
[21:18.320 --> 21:22.920]  that helped them understand what was happening and what they were under and the fact that
[21:22.920 --> 21:27.120]  the very same globalist forces that take control of their countries that have taken control
[21:27.120 --> 21:28.120]  of us.
[21:28.120 --> 21:33.320]  So, listeners of this show need to know that your investment of time and energy in this
[21:33.320 --> 21:38.800]  broadcast and in other leaders that have exposed the new world order over the decades has built
[21:38.800 --> 21:44.080]  the world wide opposition we now see and I don't say that so we all pat each other on
[21:44.080 --> 21:50.520]  the backs, I say that so you understand that resistance is not futile, that as we said
[21:50.520 --> 21:56.720]  a thousand times, no one knows who first said it, but the propaganda would not be necessary
[21:56.720 --> 22:02.160]  of the situation, it was hopeless, he won by more than 70% despite billions of foreign
[22:02.160 --> 22:06.720]  money used against him in every line and every trick in the book and there was obviously
[22:06.720 --> 22:10.720]  some election fraud, he probably won by even larger numbers.
[22:10.720 --> 22:16.200]  So this is what they're scared of, people waking up to the new world order and taking
[22:16.200 --> 22:22.440]  our countries back and when he won he said this is a victory against the globalist,
[22:22.440 --> 22:26.280]  this is a victory against the new world order, this is a victory against George Soros, this
[22:26.280 --> 22:31.200]  is a victory against the anti-family transgender movement, this is a victory against their
[22:31.200 --> 22:39.440]  ungodly system that they want, that is powerful and that is true, that is someone recognizing
[22:39.440 --> 22:44.560]  the enemy attack, recognizing what we're under and then as soon as you recognize it the public
[22:44.560 --> 22:49.120]  wakes up, you defeat it and you have prosperity and you have peace and you have security.
[22:49.120 --> 22:57.360]  So today's show is titled Monday Live, Orban's landslide victory in Hungary accelerates
[22:57.360 --> 23:05.400]  collapse of globalist new world order system.
[23:05.400 --> 23:13.600]  So again, I know I harp on this, but the reason I harp on it is you are the vanguard
[23:13.600 --> 23:17.360]  that's the most awake, it's true, listeners of The Oceanshow show are the tip of the tip
[23:17.360 --> 23:22.200]  of the spear, so I know you know this, a lot of you knew it before I knew it, the point
[23:22.200 --> 23:26.960]  is is that we better get this out to everybody because this is how we beat them, we can fight
[23:26.960 --> 23:31.120]  the heads of the Hyde Roll Day Long, hundreds of heads and it's important to expose the
[23:31.120 --> 23:38.000]  heads and what they are so people recognize the neck that goes back to the body and the
[23:38.000 --> 23:43.680]  heart and the guts and the whole system that is launching these attacks and so a lot of
[23:43.680 --> 23:48.040]  people have asked me, they have said Alex, Glynbeck attacked you, Glynbeck said terrible
[23:48.040 --> 23:52.400]  things about you, Glynbeck said you were a liar about all this 15 years ago, 10 years
[23:52.400 --> 23:56.280]  ago, why have you said Glynbeck's a good guy, well I was up there, went on the blaze, they
[23:56.280 --> 24:00.200]  were nice to me, happy on their shows, didn't censor me, he gave me a painting, but that's
[24:00.200 --> 24:06.000]  not the reason, he's awake now, he knows that I wasn't lying and he is a very articulate
[24:06.000 --> 24:11.080]  smart guy with millions of listeners and he's now really helping fight the new world order
[24:11.080 --> 24:18.240]  and that's all that matters, we can't expect everybody who wasn't awake before to be perfect
[24:18.240 --> 24:23.080]  in hindsight, what matters is what they do when the chips are down and Glynbeck's been
[24:23.080 --> 24:27.200]  doing a great job, here's two clips of back to back talking about the world government
[24:27.200 --> 24:35.520]  summit that just happened and then the holy grail of their control, state run, UN run,
[24:35.520 --> 24:40.800]  digital programmable currency, that's not bitcoin and blockchain and decentralized,
[24:40.800 --> 24:45.160]  this stuff's great, it's the answer to the bad guy stuff, but the central banks and
[24:45.160 --> 24:49.960]  their programmable tokens is the world social credit score, it is the global carbon tax,
[24:49.960 --> 24:52.120]  it is hell on earth, here's Glynbeck.
[24:52.120 --> 24:59.920]  We also need to pay attention to what is happening around us, I told you a minute ago, the world
[24:59.920 --> 25:03.960]  government summit, the what?
[25:03.960 --> 25:14.440]  The world government summit happened yesterday in Dubai and it was the introduction session
[25:14.440 --> 25:23.800]  yesterday and all the people that are the usual people were there, huge crowd, gigantic
[25:23.800 --> 25:30.880]  theater with very, I mean all of the critical important people and it was kicked off by,
[25:30.880 --> 25:34.880]  lo and behold, Klaus Schwab, here's what he said.
[25:34.880 --> 25:41.280]  We do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will
[25:41.280 --> 25:50.880]  happen, however, we do know that global energy systems, food systems and supply chains will
[25:50.880 --> 25:53.360]  be deeply affected.
[25:53.360 --> 25:54.800]  Got it?
[25:54.800 --> 26:02.240]  We are changing things and we don't know how that will go, but we do know the global
[26:02.240 --> 26:10.320]  energy system, the food system and the supply chains will be deeply affected, but other
[26:10.320 --> 26:19.200]  than that, don't worry about it, it's only food, energy and how we get things, but other
[26:19.200 --> 26:21.800]  than that, we're good.
[26:21.800 --> 26:26.520]  This is the arrogance of the elites.
[26:26.520 --> 26:32.160]  Now one of the topics, their first session was, are we ready for a new world order?
[26:32.160 --> 26:34.680]  Are they trolling us?
[26:34.680 --> 26:38.960]  I think the reason why they're naming this is because, A, they really mean it, it is
[26:38.960 --> 26:44.240]  a new world order, but they also see an advantage of calling it the new world order instead
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.760]  of the great reset, which it absolutely is, the new world order, they call it that because
[26:49.760 --> 26:54.800]  that way when I say it to you and you're like, did you hear about the global government
[26:54.800 --> 26:59.160]  where their first session was, are we ready for the new world order?
[26:59.160 --> 27:02.280]  Everybody rolls their eyes, aha.
[27:02.280 --> 27:03.960]  That is not the solution.
[27:03.960 --> 27:08.320]  The solution, if you want a digital currency, then use blockchain.
[27:08.320 --> 27:19.000]  You want a digital currency, then you use Bitcoin and you leave the off-ramp people alone.
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.800]  This is the final grab of total power globally.
[27:25.800 --> 27:32.680]  You need to understand it, you need to brush up on it, and you need to stand against it.
[27:32.680 --> 27:39.360]  You also need to prepare for a time when this does happen.
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.720]  What are you going to do?
[27:43.720 --> 27:48.120]  Most people will just go along with it because they'll say what people always say at times
[27:48.120 --> 27:52.000]  like these, well, it's not going to get any worse than this.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.560]  They'll never do that.
[27:53.560 --> 27:58.880]  I urge you to watch last night's show, my TV Wednesday night special on Blaze TV.
[27:58.880 --> 28:03.960]  It was really, really funny, classic chalkboard funny stuff.
[28:03.960 --> 28:09.480]  However, I laid out on the chalkboard, in fact, I want to play that clip later on in
[28:09.480 --> 28:10.480]  the program.
[28:10.480 --> 28:16.320]  I laid out on the chalkboard all the things that we all said could never happen.
[28:16.320 --> 28:19.840]  I spent 15 minutes before the show just writing them down on the top of my head.
[28:19.840 --> 28:20.840]  That's right.
[28:20.840 --> 28:21.840]  I'm actually a member.
[28:21.840 --> 28:24.600]  I actually watched that, even though I basically know all of that stuff, the way he does it
[28:24.600 --> 28:25.600]  is very good.
[28:25.600 --> 28:30.640]  If it was seen, what Glenn does, if every person on Earth saw it, we'd end the New World
[28:30.640 --> 28:31.640]  Order overnight.
[28:31.640 --> 28:34.640]  If you just see all the things they've already taken away, and now what they're going to
[28:34.640 --> 28:38.920]  take away, and how they admit they're the ones taking it away, I mean, why would anyone
[28:38.920 --> 28:40.520]  want these people in control?
[28:40.520 --> 28:42.560]  They're a bunch of crazy criminals.
[28:42.560 --> 28:49.240]  All right, folks, we'll be right back on the other side, infowars.com, tomorrow is Tuesday.
[28:49.240 --> 28:52.680]  There's so much we're going to be hitting.
[28:52.680 --> 28:54.760]  The pedophile news is just unbelievable.
[28:54.760 --> 28:56.760]  Let's stay with us.
[28:56.760 --> 29:06.640]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series at 1776coin.com,
[29:06.640 --> 29:10.920]  or infowarstore.com, and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[29:10.920 --> 29:14.320]  Thomas Jefferson, quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[29:14.320 --> 29:19.400]  It's a coin I designed, I'm very, very proud of it, and it will end up being a collectible.
[29:19.400 --> 29:24.520]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[29:24.520 --> 29:25.800]  we sold it.
[29:25.800 --> 29:31.480]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly, and I appreciate listeners getting
[29:31.480 --> 29:32.480]  over half of them now.
[29:32.480 --> 29:34.600]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[29:34.600 --> 29:39.280]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days, and without the last coin
[29:39.280 --> 29:42.880]  sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[29:42.880 --> 29:45.000]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people, and that's a big problem.
[29:45.000 --> 29:48.920]  So as a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom,
[29:48.920 --> 29:53.160]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems, so please give yourself
[29:53.160 --> 29:59.480]  and us aid in the fight against the new world order at 1776coin.com.
[29:59.480 --> 30:08.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20-year history,
[30:08.320 --> 30:13.240]  and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[30:13.240 --> 30:19.120]  are broken down, and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[30:19.120 --> 30:24.040]  operations, and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making
[30:24.040 --> 30:25.040]  their main move.
[30:25.040 --> 30:29.320]  Info wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[30:29.320 --> 30:34.480]  ever despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure
[30:34.480 --> 30:38.800]  and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[30:38.800 --> 30:45.400]  So listen, up to 75% off infowarstore.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that
[30:45.400 --> 30:51.200]  help spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films, everything

[30:58.920 --> 31:03.160]  You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true, that info
[31:03.160 --> 31:11.520]  wars is seen by the globalists as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[31:11.520 --> 31:19.160]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program, and man, our work is really right
[31:19.160 --> 31:24.400]  now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done, so I'm asking listeners

[32:19.120 --> 32:23.560]  activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and
[32:23.560 --> 32:25.480]  supercharge our immune systems.

[33:00.960 --> 33:07.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:07.080 --> 33:17.280]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:17.280 --> 33:25.760]  The first kind of test case for big tech joining together to just delete somebody from the
[33:25.760 --> 33:30.920]  Internet, to unperson them was when all the platforms got together and banned Alex Jones,
[33:30.920 --> 33:34.840]  and they counted on people saying, oh, I don't really like Alex Jones, he's kind of crazy.
[33:34.840 --> 33:37.200]  Even if that's what you thought, you don't need to hear from Alex Jones, you have to
[33:37.200 --> 33:41.000]  think about the precedent, which was, now they have this power to do that to anyone
[33:41.000 --> 33:44.040]  and it was so predictable they would start doing it to more and more people, they did
[33:44.040 --> 33:47.000]  it to you, they do it to all kinds of people.
[33:47.000 --> 33:48.520]  The same is true here.
[33:48.520 --> 33:53.680]  We've had one crisis after the next, Russiagate, January 6th, the COVID pandemic, now this
[33:53.680 --> 33:54.680]  war.
[33:54.680 --> 33:59.080]  We're being conditioned to believe that it's in our best interest to allow the government
[33:59.080 --> 34:03.920]  to block us from accessing certain information in the name of national security, in the name
[34:03.920 --> 34:08.000]  of the public health, and it's an extremely dangerous thing because if you let them do
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.800]  that because you don't want to hear Russian disinformation or whatever you've decided
[34:11.800 --> 34:16.480]  should be banned in the first instance, you have to think about the scheme, the system
[34:16.480 --> 34:26.640]  that you're empowering and how that's going to be used going forward.
[34:26.640 --> 34:27.640]  With a rebel yell.
[34:27.640 --> 34:36.320]  Yeah, folks, if you want to find the rebel command base against tyranny, you found it
[34:36.320 --> 34:39.320]  right here.
[34:39.320 --> 34:46.680]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I, again, I'm very thankful to be here with you now today.
[34:46.680 --> 34:53.800]  All right, let's hit the really serious news here up front because for globalists, the
[34:53.800 --> 34:55.320]  global government is just the beginning.
[34:55.320 --> 35:00.440]  They want to carry out forced depopulation, they've got to get us stunned and poisoned,
[35:00.440 --> 35:05.320]  they've got to get us to submit and to degrade ourselves and to let our basic human rights
[35:05.320 --> 35:06.320]  be violated.
[35:06.320 --> 35:11.240]  We've got plenty of footage out of China and out of Singapore of robots policing people
[35:11.240 --> 35:22.360]  and of the public being made in long thousand person lines to get on their knees so that
[35:22.360 --> 35:28.760]  when they get scanned to see if they've got their COVID pass to be able to walk down the
[35:28.760 --> 35:34.280]  street or be able to get on a bus or a train that they've submitted and it makes it easier
[35:34.280 --> 35:41.480]  if you kneel and so you have to wait in a stress position kneeling, in some cases for
[35:41.480 --> 35:49.960]  hours until they come to you, zero COVID disaster, China deploys army of parents and children
[35:49.960 --> 35:56.640]  separated in quarantine facilities, isn't that insane?
[35:56.640 --> 36:02.240]  So all of it is giant exercises of power and control and the footage of thousands of vans
[36:02.240 --> 36:10.760]  rolling up to arrest everyone in giant tower apartment buildings and the same thing was
[36:10.760 --> 36:17.880]  done in Australia, the same thing has been a giant beta test but now that massive, massive
[36:17.880 --> 36:23.240]  resistance forming in the west, oh, suddenly it's not a problem in Australia and you don't
[36:23.240 --> 36:27.800]  need the vaccine passed by our cell so that opposition doesn't keep forming and so laws
[36:27.800 --> 36:32.200]  don't get passed against it so they can bring it back later and if you read what the UN
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.600]  and Fauci and the Canadian ministers all of them are saying, they're going to bring it
[36:36.600 --> 36:43.400]  back very, very soon and China, look at this dramatic footage in China, millions of people
[36:43.400 --> 36:53.320]  sometimes lined up outside for days being processed in and out of giant quarantine centers and
[36:53.320 --> 36:58.360]  I saw some of the footage, these things are bigger than NFL football stadiums filled with
[36:58.360 --> 37:05.400]  people on tiny cots, just a few feet away from others, children put in one area, men
[37:05.400 --> 37:10.680]  put in another, women in another, separated, total dehumanization.
[37:10.680 --> 37:21.280]  They didn't even have COVID, piles of garbage on the ground, that's one of the quarantine
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.840]  centers I saw one even bigger, imagine this is the new world order, this is the global
[37:26.840 --> 37:31.720]  social credit score, this is their plan but let's talk about the other forms of mind control
[37:31.720 --> 37:32.720]  going on.
[37:32.720 --> 37:39.440]  Here's a speech therapist says her clinic has seen a 364% increase in patient referrals
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.920]  of babies and toddlers and every other major speech therapist is saying they're seeing
[37:44.920 --> 37:52.440]  the same thing, massive increases in suicide, massive increases in bankruptcies and homelessness
[37:52.440 --> 38:01.200]  as people were put into a two year tyranny, here's a clip of her on 25 news, here it is.
[38:01.200 --> 38:05.880]  Jacqueline Teak says during this pandemic her speech therapy clinic has seen an enormous
[38:05.880 --> 38:11.280]  shift in the ages of their patients, before the pandemic only 5% of patients were babies
[38:11.280 --> 38:18.360]  and toddlers, today it is sore to 20%, many parents calling it COVID delayed.
[38:18.360 --> 38:24.920]  We've seen a 364% increase in patient referrals of babies and toddlers from pediatricians
[38:24.920 --> 38:26.680]  and parents.
[38:26.680 --> 38:29.960]  And they are children that are having a difficult time speaking.
[38:29.960 --> 38:30.960]  Speech delayed.
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.520]  Babies start learning how to speak by reading lips as young as 8 months, so what happens
[38:35.520 --> 38:41.360]  when lips and faces are covered up by masks, a therapist say for some kids they can work
[38:41.360 --> 38:45.720]  around the mask and still learn to speak perfectly fine, but for others it can cause
[38:45.720 --> 38:46.720]  speech delays.
[38:46.720 --> 38:50.640]  There's no research out there yet to say that this could be causing speech and language
[38:50.640 --> 38:54.200]  delays, but most definitely it's I'm sure a factor.
[38:54.200 --> 38:58.280]  It's very important kids do see your face to learn, so they're watching your mouth.
[38:58.280 --> 39:00.280]  That's orange, can you say orange?
[39:00.280 --> 39:02.720]  That was a good try.
[39:02.720 --> 39:07.240]  Brianna Gay is raising 5 children, but it's her youngest who needs therapy.
[39:07.240 --> 39:11.560]  It definitely makes a difference when the world you're growing up in you can't interact
[39:11.560 --> 39:14.480]  with people in their face.
[39:14.480 --> 39:16.880]  It's super important to babies.
[39:16.880 --> 39:21.120]  We're seeing a lot of things that look just like autism.
[39:21.120 --> 39:30.120]  They're not making any word attempts and not communicating at all with their family.
[39:30.120 --> 39:38.520]  If you go back to the founding of Islam, 1500, 1600 years ago at the crossroads of Mecca
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.480]  and Medina, there were a bunch of warring tribes that would rob the caravans coming
[39:43.480 --> 39:49.080]  out of the east and then coming through what is Saudi Arabia today and then up into Syria
[39:49.080 --> 39:55.920]  and into Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire now also under Islamic control, now
[39:55.920 --> 40:09.320]  known as Turkey and its capital no longer Istanbul, Constantinople previously now Istanbul.
[40:09.320 --> 40:19.440]  What the point is, is that you're tuned in and you say, Alex, what are you talking about?
[40:19.440 --> 40:25.800]  Muhammad and children not being able to speak or talk and basically having their speech centers
[40:25.800 --> 40:29.800]  damaged, brain damage, cause brain damage.
[40:29.800 --> 40:32.320]  What's that to do with Muhammad?
[40:32.320 --> 40:39.040]  Well, when they would kidnap women, they'd put hoods over their heads and then even after
[40:39.040 --> 40:44.800]  they got taken thousands of miles of whoever they were being sold to, when they took the
[40:44.800 --> 40:51.480]  hood off their head, cause they didn't want damage by sun and flies and all the rest,
[40:51.480 --> 40:56.760]  they wanted to sell them on a slave block, then the women were also told so other men
[40:56.760 --> 41:01.280]  wouldn't see what other men owned to cover their faces again and if you go back to the
[41:01.280 --> 41:06.840]  ancient writings, many of the women had trouble speaking in the Middle East and other areas
[41:06.840 --> 41:11.240]  under Islamic control.
[41:11.240 --> 41:16.720]  So see, all this mind control you see today is old mind control.
[41:16.720 --> 41:22.040]  When you gag somebody, when you cover their face up, when you do this to children, particularly
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.720]  over long periods of time, you're screwing them up for life and the system knew damn
[41:26.720 --> 41:31.360]  well what it was doing when it was doing it.
[41:31.360 --> 41:36.960]  We got to go to break, but I want to come back and get into these new Pfizer documents.
[41:36.960 --> 41:40.320]  You know, they've been battling in the last year to not release any of the documents,
[41:40.320 --> 41:42.600]  but a few groups of documents have been released.
[41:42.600 --> 41:50.080]  Now the biggest tronch or group has been released, tens of thousands of pages and this just happened
[41:50.080 --> 41:55.080]  on Thursday and now folks have had a chance to read through them and they consciously
[41:55.080 --> 42:03.560]  covered up massive blood plots, massive heart attacks, explosive levels of microcarditis
[42:03.560 --> 42:10.160]  heart swelling and ADE that killed a bunch of people and it's exactly what we thought
[42:10.160 --> 42:13.320]  would be in the document.
[42:13.320 --> 42:20.680]  The Moderna hurts and diseases and kills three times what Pfizer does.
[42:20.680 --> 42:27.680]  It's the same shot, basically the same thing, but it's three times stronger and right there
[42:27.680 --> 42:31.760]  in the data, it's three times roughly the level.
[42:31.760 --> 42:37.280]  I mean, it's right there and they blacked it out the first time they released it, showing
[42:37.280 --> 42:40.680]  they know what it says, obviously.
[42:40.680 --> 42:44.640]  It's their weapon and then the judge ordered it unredacted, so now they released it unredacted
[42:44.640 --> 42:50.880]  and there it is, open and shut a weapon to destroy people's immune systems and cause massive
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.920]  illnesses and problems and remember about one percent of adverse effects get reported,
[42:54.920 --> 42:59.360]  so this is in the millions of debt.
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.120]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[43:03.120 --> 43:07.760]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in ten days.
[43:07.760 --> 43:15.480]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered
[43:15.480 --> 43:20.040]  and I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins
[43:20.040 --> 43:24.300]  and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the
[43:24.300 --> 43:26.560]  front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[43:26.560 --> 43:34.280]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[43:34.280 --> 43:40.960]  This is powerful, witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history
[43:40.960 --> 43:46.480]  and be part of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near
[43:46.480 --> 43:49.920]  future thanks to your support of this project.
[43:49.920 --> 43:56.000]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air and also gives you a real
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.480]  piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[44:00.480 --> 44:04.560]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going
[44:04.560 --> 44:07.440]  on both at home and the world at large.
[44:07.440 --> 44:12.640]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep
[44:12.640 --> 44:16.080]  support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[44:16.080 --> 44:21.400]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you
[44:21.400 --> 44:24.200]  get the shut eye you deserve.
[44:24.200 --> 44:28.640]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product knockout with down and out, now the
[44:28.640 --> 44:34.120]  herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[44:34.120 --> 44:38.520]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[44:38.520 --> 44:43.800]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally
[44:43.800 --> 44:49.520]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[44:49.520 --> 44:53.800]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will
[44:53.800 --> 44:55.720]  be down and out.
[44:55.720 --> 44:59.720]  Tell it out now at www.IfTheWarStore.com.
[44:59.720 --> 45:07.160]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[45:07.160 --> 45:10.360]  until the populations rebelled.
[45:10.360 --> 45:15.880]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[45:15.880 --> 45:18.800]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[45:18.800 --> 45:24.320]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[45:24.320 --> 45:30.040]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[45:30.040 --> 45:36.480]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[45:36.480 --> 45:37.480]  than ever.
[45:37.480 --> 45:42.000]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[45:42.000 --> 45:48.360]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[45:48.360 --> 45:51.080]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[45:51.080 --> 45:56.320]  So pray for these folks big time, it's a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com
[45:56.320 --> 45:59.280]  because truth is absolutely bare mouth.
[45:59.280 --> 46:03.840]  You know it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars
[46:03.840 --> 46:11.880]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[46:11.880 --> 46:19.640]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now
[46:19.640 --> 46:23.640]  hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[46:23.640 --> 46:30.360]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowars.com
[46:30.360 --> 46:35.480]  and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you and so now we need to support more
[46:35.480 --> 46:41.760]  than ever because this fight has intensified, don't need me to tell you that at infowars.com.
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.920]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now, things have been sold out for a long
[46:46.920 --> 46:52.640]  time like infowars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing and our new immune support
[46:52.640 --> 47:00.120]  formula that's so critical, they're all available 25 to 75% off at infowars.com right now.
[47:00.120 --> 47:29.400]  So the world's awakening to the new world order technocrat plan and their answer is
[47:29.400 --> 47:37.320]  use of virus scare, which they said the Rockefeller Foundation documents, operation lockstep,
[47:37.320 --> 47:43.560]  they would use a virus scare to bring in the casual society, to bring them the control,
[47:43.560 --> 47:49.520]  to bring in masks, to bring in checkpoints, to overthrow our open free society not to
[47:49.520 --> 47:53.440]  protect us or empower us but to enslave us and then finally kill us.
[47:53.440 --> 47:58.960]  Here's some of the headlines, mask wearing has led the generation of toddlers struggling
[47:58.960 --> 48:05.600]  with speech and social skills and it goes through the evidence and the information there.
[48:05.600 --> 48:12.080]  Good news, judge strikes down New York City's mask mandate for toddlers, mayor vows to appeal,
[48:12.080 --> 48:19.080]  they never want it to go away, this is a cult, ladies and gentlemen, the nanny state.
[48:19.080 --> 48:22.480]  Here's the big article, came out over the weekend, it's linked to all the documents,
[48:22.480 --> 48:29.120]  making recently unredacted documents prove Pfizer and FDA new antibody-dependent enhancement
[48:29.120 --> 48:32.520]  occurred in the vaccinated.
[48:32.520 --> 48:35.160]  But what else do the numbers show?
[48:35.160 --> 48:40.240]  Let's go ahead and play this Naomi Wolf clip, clip four, she talks about the documented
[48:40.240 --> 48:47.800]  deaths from Pfizer versus what's happening with Moderna, that's the exact same shot just
[48:47.800 --> 48:50.240]  three times stronger, here it is.
[48:50.240 --> 48:51.240]  Thank you.
[48:51.240 --> 48:56.120]  You have the deck in the con, it's your baby, you roll it.
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.560]  I will make good use of it because people really need to know and understand what these
[49:00.560 --> 49:06.520]  amazing volunteers and the lawyers are finding in these documents that again to remind everyone,
[49:06.520 --> 49:11.440]  Pfizer and the FDA tried to conceal, these are public documents they tried to keep from
[49:11.440 --> 49:12.440]  you.
[49:12.440 --> 49:21.440]  In just 2021, there were 1810 deaths from Pfizer vaccines or after Pfizer vaccines and
[49:21.440 --> 49:24.480]  1832 from Moderna.
[49:24.480 --> 49:27.640]  So now I'm going to highlight a big difference.
[49:27.640 --> 49:38.880]  So of the total adverse events in 2021, Pfizer's first dose was, pay attention, 145,664 adverse
[49:38.880 --> 49:41.480]  events, bad things happened.
[49:41.480 --> 49:50.640]  Moderna's first dose, pay attention, 236,316, a big difference.
[49:50.640 --> 49:55.160]  All right, so let's drill down into that and you see something pretty creepy.
[49:55.160 --> 49:59.760]  Some of you are probably already remembering that a few weeks ago here on this show, which
[49:59.760 --> 50:04.560]  as far as I know is the only platform where anyone is doing the kind of reporting that
[50:04.560 --> 50:09.800]  should be done about this vastly important trove of documents, you remember we did a
[50:09.800 --> 50:18.520]  feature on how there were different dosages of the mRNA, the lipid nanoparticles between
[50:18.520 --> 50:21.360]  Pfizer and Moderna and the other brands.
[50:21.360 --> 50:29.200]  Well, there's an 89,000 difference between Pfizer's bad outcomes and Moderna's bad outcomes,
[50:29.200 --> 50:31.400]  much worse for Moderna.
[50:31.400 --> 50:39.960]  So I will now tell you that remember the Moderna micrograms were 100 micrograms per dose for
[50:39.960 --> 50:45.160]  adults and Pfizer's first dose was 30 micrograms.
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.040]  So right there, people who got Moderna for first dose, and I don't want to scare up
[50:50.040 --> 50:54.000]  said anyone, but the sooner we realize what has happened here, the better, the better
[50:54.000 --> 50:57.600]  we can treat people and care for people.
[50:57.600 --> 51:01.120]  Moderna was three times the amount of lipid nanoparticles.
[51:01.120 --> 51:09.160]  I keep going back to these, these tiny, hard, fatty casings, these industrial casings.
[51:09.160 --> 51:16.040]  Now scientists in Europe and scientists in Asia simultaneously have rolled out, just like
[51:16.040 --> 51:20.760]  radio was invented in several different parts of the world at the same time, because that's
[51:20.760 --> 51:22.840]  just how the technology had advanced.
[51:22.840 --> 51:32.840]  They have now come out with nanotech graphene oxide programmable nanotech that they say
[51:32.840 --> 51:37.080]  they're going to put down your throat like something out of the matrix that will then
[51:37.080 --> 51:44.960]  be programmed to go where they want to find things in your body and take it out.
[51:44.960 --> 51:46.640]  This is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:46.640 --> 51:48.360]  Well, what do you think they're doing?
[51:48.360 --> 51:51.040]  They're already implanting you with graphene oxide.
[51:51.040 --> 51:55.760]  They've got the patents to use that to turn you into the blockchain and track and trace
[51:55.760 --> 51:59.880]  everything you do, everywhere you go.
[51:59.880 --> 52:06.040]  This is the takeover of society, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:06.040 --> 52:07.920]  So we've got more on that.
[52:07.920 --> 52:11.800]  What they're doing is they're just rolling out all the technologies that are to develop
[52:11.800 --> 52:15.680]  just to overwhelm you so you accept all of it being used against you.
[52:15.680 --> 52:17.920]  But this is a big deal.
[52:17.920 --> 52:23.560]  Only unredacted documents prove Pfizer and FDA knew antibody-dependent enhancement occurring
[52:23.560 --> 52:25.360]  in the vaccinated.
[52:25.360 --> 52:29.240]  They knew it was happening, and what did they do?
[52:29.240 --> 52:34.040]  They covered the whole thing up.
[52:34.040 --> 52:40.440]  The UK sees a 44% increase in child deaths after JAB rolled out for young teens data
[52:40.440 --> 52:41.440]  shows.
[52:41.440 --> 52:42.440]  Wow!
[52:42.440 --> 52:51.440]  18 to 64 in Europe, in the UK, in the US, they found the exact same number.
[52:51.440 --> 53:00.800]  Not down to the fraction, but down to the number of 40% of working-age people increase
[53:00.800 --> 53:07.920]  in death, not from COVID, but just in general in 2021.
[53:07.920 --> 53:15.120]  And now the number's even higher in children and in teens that took the shot.
[53:15.120 --> 53:23.400]  That is out of the National Office of Statistics, the government put that out.
[53:23.400 --> 53:29.000]  And see how we just report on this like it's no big deal?
[53:29.000 --> 53:35.640]  They're killing us, and they're doing it and testing to see if we wake up and say no to
[53:35.640 --> 53:38.000]  him.
[53:38.000 --> 53:44.040]  Yeah, we got the media all focused on the Russia-Ukraine War, while the elephant in
[53:44.040 --> 53:50.680]  the room is the Pfizer clinical trials and documents.
[53:50.680 --> 53:55.600]  Rand Paul says once upon a time, Anthony Fauci could tell the truth about natural immunity.
[53:55.600 --> 53:58.000]  We've played that video many times from over a decade ago.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.080]  He says, oh, the best thing is natural immunity.
[54:00.080 --> 54:01.840]  It's the gold standard.
[54:01.840 --> 54:06.240]  It's just hundreds of times better than a vaccine, which is well known.
[54:06.240 --> 54:10.040]  But now, remember, you couldn't talk about it.
[54:10.040 --> 54:13.280]  LinkedIn blocked links to natural immunity data.
[54:13.280 --> 54:15.480]  Even medical doctors were banned.
[54:15.480 --> 54:17.480]  Instagram did it.
[54:17.480 --> 54:20.360]  Facebook did it.
[54:20.360 --> 54:21.360]  Twitter did it.
[54:21.360 --> 54:30.880]  They won't even let you link to JAMA studies put out by the Journal of American Medicine.
[54:30.880 --> 54:35.520]  There you go, folks, and Fauci says, get ready.
[54:35.520 --> 54:36.520]  More stuff's coming in.
[54:36.520 --> 54:42.160]  Good ol' Google has added new fat checkers to news, and will push users to credible sources.
[54:42.160 --> 54:47.560]  How else can you get away with mass murder like this by controlling the information?
[54:47.560 --> 54:48.800]  Info wars right again.
[54:48.800 --> 54:55.920]  World Health Organization admits COVID vaccine linked to hearing loss, yep.
[54:55.920 --> 54:58.560]  UK government now admits that COVID vaccines are gene therapy.
[54:58.560 --> 55:06.720]  They got a bunch of other ones they want to make you take now.
[55:06.720 --> 55:07.720]  Pretty amazing.
[55:07.720 --> 55:12.080]  Very important report on banned.video by Jay Dyer, scientific elite to tell a plan to
[55:12.080 --> 55:13.180]  kill everybody.
[55:13.180 --> 55:19.320]  He has their top people all admitting total extermination of all humans as a plan.
[55:19.320 --> 55:21.360]  Pretty big deal.
[55:21.360 --> 55:25.680]  No wonder they want us off the air, because they're not going to get away with this if
[55:25.680 --> 55:28.680]  humanity is aware of what's happening.
[55:28.680 --> 55:34.480]  I want to hit the big economy news, the military news, and more than Paul, Joseph Watson's
[55:34.480 --> 55:36.880]  going to join us, Owen's going to join us.
[55:36.880 --> 55:40.880]  We've got so much that we're about to be breaking down here today.
[55:40.880 --> 55:45.240]  I need to fund our operations, so I try to sell you products that you enjoy, that empower
[55:45.240 --> 55:47.560]  you, that enrich you, that really work.
[55:47.560 --> 55:53.560]  So, you come back and buy more, and we have a symbiotic relationship.
[55:53.560 --> 55:56.880]  There's been major supply chain breakdowns, as you know, the last few years.
[55:56.880 --> 56:00.880]  That's why so many products we've had to either discontinue in them, or reformulate them,
[56:00.880 --> 56:04.480]  or just wait and wait and wait for them to come in.
[56:04.480 --> 56:10.960]  It was 11 months ago we put our deposit down to the U.S. company that has a deal with France
[56:10.960 --> 56:17.560]  to get the patented special quail eggs that are fed a secret diet that in major even
[56:17.560 --> 56:22.440]  trials and studies have been proven to work better than over-the-counter antihistamines
[56:22.440 --> 56:24.320]  but in a natural way.
[56:24.320 --> 56:30.520]  And finally, 11 months after I put down the money to get it, we were about to discontinue
[56:30.520 --> 56:31.680]  and demand our money back.
[56:31.680 --> 56:37.760]  It came in, pollen block, packaged here in the U.S. specially fed quail in France.
[56:37.760 --> 56:42.360]  I discovered this 100 years ago that they were being fed a certain diet, and people
[56:42.360 --> 56:45.920]  ate those eggs, because the French eat a lot of quail eggs, a lot of people in Texas do
[56:45.920 --> 56:49.640]  it, but the point is that you wouldn't get allergies.
[56:49.640 --> 56:52.400]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's from the quail.
[56:52.400 --> 56:53.920]  Egg shell, I should add.
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.640]  Well, it's back in stock, 40% off, and who knows, this is to be the only time it's ever
[56:58.640 --> 56:59.640]  available again.
[56:59.640 --> 57:04.120]  There's another bringing lockdowns and shutdowns back, but we finally got it back in.
[57:04.120 --> 57:06.640]  It's very proprietary, very, very special.
[57:06.640 --> 57:07.640]  It's available.
[57:07.640 --> 57:11.640]  It's on a Ferrado ship with additional 10% off, then we'll hold some back for your next
[57:11.640 --> 57:15.600]  order so you are sure to get it, but we're ready to ship it to you right now, back in
[57:15.600 --> 57:23.960]  stock, pollen block at infowarstore.com, or AAA-2533139.
[57:23.960 --> 57:27.680]  Help support healthy sinus function, helps enhance respiratory function, helps clear
[57:27.680 --> 57:31.840]  passageways and airways, normal breathing, promotes respiratory health, and normal breathing
[57:31.840 --> 57:36.480]  supports eye comfort and sinus health, and so much more quail egg concentrate.
[57:36.480 --> 57:40.800]  It's just pure quail egg concentrate at infowarstore.com.
[57:40.800 --> 57:48.760]  We'll be right back on the other side, stay with us.
[57:48.760 --> 57:57.040]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[57:57.040 --> 58:00.320]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[58:00.320 --> 58:04.880]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[58:04.880 --> 58:08.120]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[58:08.120 --> 58:13.640]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered, and it will probably sell
[58:13.640 --> 58:15.680]  out in 10 days again.
[58:15.680 --> 58:18.160]  It certainly needs to in front of operation.
[58:18.160 --> 58:23.200]  It is so historic, and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[58:23.200 --> 58:27.080]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants, and more.
[58:27.080 --> 58:31.080]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[58:31.080 --> 58:33.320]  It's also at infowarstore.com.
[58:33.320 --> 58:34.320]  It's amazing.
[58:34.320 --> 58:38.840]  It's only 10,000 of them, and as a founding member, and we're able to stay on the air,
[58:38.840 --> 58:43.560]  we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next
[58:43.560 --> 58:44.560]  level.
[58:44.560 --> 58:48.760]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[58:48.760 --> 58:53.280]  Introducing the newest product from infowarstore.com.
[58:53.280 --> 58:56.800]  We are so proud of Info Wars Live immune support.
[58:56.800 --> 59:03.000]  It is concentrated herbs that are known on record to supercharge our body's natural
[59:03.000 --> 59:04.480]  defenses.
[59:04.480 --> 59:08.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get, and
[59:08.720 --> 59:12.040]  on top of it, it funds the Info War, so that's a 360 win.
[59:12.040 --> 59:15.520]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[59:15.520 --> 59:21.480]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root,
[59:21.480 --> 59:23.960]  loatium root, and more.
[59:23.960 --> 59:25.920]  This product is incredible.
[59:25.920 --> 59:31.280]  Info Wars immune support, exclusively available at infowarstore.com, is funding the tip of
[59:31.280 --> 59:33.600]  the spear, the Info Wars operation.
[59:33.600 --> 59:35.000]  It is a 360 win.
[59:35.000 --> 59:39.440]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[59:39.440 --> 59:42.080]  natural defenses and keep Info Wars on the air.
[59:42.080 --> 59:44.520]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[59:44.520 --> 1:00:14.160]  Take action now, infowarstore.com.
[1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:15.160]  Welcome back, my friends.
[1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:18.680]  To the tip of the spear, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:22.120]  All right, I'm just going to play a few of these clips.
[1:00:22.120 --> 1:00:31.000]  This is just what I came across today of government leaders, corporate pitch people, the prime
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:38.520]  minister of Canada just saying outrageous lies about how good the vaccine is and how wonderful
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:43.800]  it works and how if you take it, you can't spread the virus and you're sick.
[1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:49.320]  It actually makes you sicker, destroys your immune system, that it makes your sex life
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:50.320]  better, they're saying.
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:51.320]  There's no evidence of that.
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:57.200]  Another total lie, and then Trudeau just saying it's so magic, he took it, and it was just
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:58.200]  so incredible.
[1:00:58.200 --> 1:00:59.960]  It made him feel so good.
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:06.880]  Let's play the head of the CDC, and then let's play this little PR piece about how it makes
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:07.880]  your sex life better.
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:12.280]  And then at the end, we're going to play Justin Trudeau, and maybe Luke Trudeau a couple
[1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:18.680]  of times because it's just so fake, so ridiculous that if his car salesman walked up acting
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:20.280]  like this, you'd run off the car lot.
[1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:28.320]  I mean, he looks like the American psycho dude, here it is.
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:37.400]  Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick,
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:41.720]  and that it's not just in the clinical trials, but it's also in real world data.
[1:01:41.720 --> 1:01:42.720]  Get real.
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:43.720]  Get real.
[1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:44.720]  Get real.
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:45.720]  Get real.
[1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:46.720]  Get real.
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:47.720]  Get real.
[1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:48.720]  About COVID-19 vaccines.
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:49.720]  Child, I wish.
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:55.720]  First time speaking, not from me, I'm so horny.
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:02:01.440]  There's been no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines are associated with impotence, or affecting
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:03.360]  your sex drive negatively.
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:10.200]  In fact, speaking to one gentleman recently, he told me that the vaccines actually has
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:16.280]  improved his sex drive, and he actually wanted to take another shot, which I discouraged,
[1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:18.480]  because that's not the purpose of the vaccine.
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:23.000]  Everybody that I've spoken to said that they are having more sex than ever since they got
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  the vaccine.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:30.560]  Listen, because I feel like since we've got the vaccination, it's been on 10 or 20.
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:31.560]  You know what?
[1:02:31.560 --> 1:02:32.560]  Let's say 100.
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:39.440]  The virus itself is what causes the impotence, meaning that males are unable to get it off.
[1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:45.360]  If you may have people you're not struggling to rise to the occasion when they get the COVID-19
[1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:49.680]  virus, but that has not been reported when it comes on to getting the vaccine.
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:57.720]  Every day, all day, all the time, I don't know about impotence at all, it's a lie.
[1:02:57.720 --> 1:03:00.280]  Don't believe it.
[1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:04.240]  Getting that shot really was an amazing feeling.
[1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:05.240]  It hits you.
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:09.160]  Getting that shot, really was an amazing feeling.
[1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:13.480]  It hits you, getting that shot really was an amazing feeling.
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:18.960]  It hits you, getting that shot really was an amazing feeling.
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:23.400]  It hits you, getting that shot really was an amazing feeling.
[1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:26.080]  Paul, so if you think he actually took a shot.
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:31.260]  I got a bridge, I'm willing to sell you in Manhattan and I got some motionfront property
[1:03:31.260 --> 1:03:34.540]  in Arizona and from my front porch, you can see the sea.
[1:03:34.540 --> 1:03:43.340]  Wow. Unbelievable. And then I've got stuff even more insane than this. I mean, the Supreme
[1:03:43.340 --> 1:03:48.380]  Court nominee Brown Jackson, they got the transcripts where she's like trying to let
[1:03:48.380 --> 1:04:00.980]  people out of jail that produce child porn of people raping toddlers. Yeah, there it
[1:04:00.980 --> 1:04:08.460]  is. She chose leniency in baby sex torture. I mean, come on, man. To quote Joe Biden.
[1:04:08.460 --> 1:04:15.620]  But again, they've got all the leftists will do anything they're told. They're in a cult
[1:04:15.620 --> 1:04:24.620]  so they've gone over the edge of this idiocy cliff. Mind blowing. But this was always going
[1:04:24.620 --> 1:04:30.300]  to happen. Our tolerance of evil has allowed this to manifest. Our tolerance of corruption
[1:04:30.300 --> 1:04:34.220]  has allowed this to happen. Thomas Jefferson was once asked, what is the level of tyranny
[1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:38.380]  to which evil man will put us under? And he said the level to which you will accept. We
[1:04:38.380 --> 1:04:44.220]  are the governors of this. We have allowed this, the censorship, the control, the devaluation
[1:04:44.220 --> 1:04:48.940]  of our currencies and all of it. We're going to lay out the devaluation of currencies
[1:04:48.940 --> 1:04:55.100]  straight ahead on the other side. And then we're going to hit the Pito Ness.
[1:04:55.100 --> 1:05:04.980]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part Founder series at 1776 coin
[1:05:04.980 --> 1:05:10.660]  dot com or info or store.com. And the second installment is the Tree of Liberty. Thomas
[1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:15.140]  Jefferson quote must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It's a coin I designed.
[1:05:15.140 --> 1:05:20.100]  I'm very, very proud of it. And it will end up being a collectible. I know that the first
[1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:25.340]  coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it. We
[1:05:25.340 --> 1:05:30.980]  need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly. And I appreciate listeners getting
[1:05:30.980 --> 1:05:35.060]  over half of them now. I'd like to move them out very quickly. I think they will sell out
[1:05:35.060 --> 1:05:41.460]  probably in five or six more days. And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating
[1:05:41.460 --> 1:05:44.500]  at the same capacity. We have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem.
[1:05:44.500 --> 1:05:48.420]  So as a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom,
[1:05:48.420 --> 1:05:52.700]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems. So please give yourself
[1:05:52.700 --> 1:06:05.860]  and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776 coin dot com crashing through the
[1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:13.260]  lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:35.900]  war. In 1978, I was four years old. I'd just gone and watched the first Star Wars installment
[1:06:35.900 --> 1:06:40.780]  with my dad and was blown away. And yes, we used to sit there and watch Saturday Night
[1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:47.980]  Live Saturday evenings as a family. So no doubt as a four year old, I watched this Dan
[1:06:47.980 --> 1:06:54.180]  Acroyd comedy piece, which predicted what we're now living under, where politicians
[1:06:54.180 --> 1:07:00.180]  and central banks are telling us first that inflation wasn't happening. Then Oh, inflation
[1:07:00.180 --> 1:07:06.060]  is not that bad. Well, it's going to get intense. But hey, it's going to make what you have
[1:07:06.060 --> 1:07:11.540]  in the bank worth more. Actually, it's not. It just makes what you have in the bank worth
[1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:20.460]  less. But here is a piece of comedy from 44 years ago that doesn't make you laugh. It
[1:07:20.460 --> 1:07:31.980]  makes you cry. Inflation is our friend. For example, consider this. In the year 2000,
[1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:36.660]  the current trends continue. The average blue color annual wage in this country will be
[1:07:36.660 --> 1:07:44.140]  $568,000. Think what this inflated world of the future will mean. Most Americans will
[1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:51.180]  be millionaires. Everyone will feel like a big shot. Wouldn't you like to own a $4,000
[1:07:51.180 --> 1:08:04.380]  suit and smoke a $75 cigar, drive a $600,000 car? I know I would. But what about people
[1:08:04.380 --> 1:08:08.740]  on fixed incomes? They have always been the true victims of inflation. That's why I will
[1:08:08.740 --> 1:08:13.660]  present to Congress the inflation maintenance program whereby the US Treasury will make
[1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:18.900]  up any inflation costs losses through direct tax rebates to the public in cash. Now you
[1:08:18.900 --> 1:08:24.500]  may say, won't that cost a lot of money? Won't that increase the deficit? Sure it will. But
[1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:30.860]  so what? We'll just print more money. We'll have the papers. We'll have the mints. I
[1:08:30.860 --> 1:08:37.340]  can just call up the Bureau of Engraven and say, hi, this is Jimmer. Roll off some of
[1:08:37.340 --> 1:08:44.780]  them 20s. Print up a couple of thousand sheets of those century notes. Sure the glut of dollars
[1:08:44.780 --> 1:08:50.460]  will cause even more inflation, but who cares? Everybody will be a million. So that's Dan
[1:08:50.460 --> 1:09:00.260]  Akroyd making fun of Jimmy Carter 44 years ago. But we can blame Jimmy Carter. We can
[1:09:00.260 --> 1:09:07.220]  blame Joe Biden, but they're just puppets. It's the Federal Reserve that's doing it.
[1:09:07.220 --> 1:09:10.860]  And just like it was okay to make fun of Jimmy Carter back then, great. Terrible guy I don't
[1:09:10.860 --> 1:09:16.300]  like him. An angel compared to people like Biden today, but still they're not actually
[1:09:16.300 --> 1:09:21.980]  running it. So if you just blame them, the same globalists continue to dominate and control.
[1:09:21.980 --> 1:09:28.460]  Don't know who to blame. People like JP Morgan's head warns US faces unprecedented risks from
[1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:33.780]  combo of inflation, war and COVID. Well, the central banks created the inflation. They
[1:09:33.780 --> 1:09:41.260]  created the COVID lockdowns and they pushed policies that created the war. And they're
[1:09:41.260 --> 1:09:49.420]  going to continue to do all this as long as they think they are getting away with it.
[1:09:49.420 --> 1:09:54.900]  The minute they start getting the blame like Disney is for all its pedophile promotion,
[1:09:54.900 --> 1:09:59.980]  they're going to start backing off. That's why they want to use politicians as their
[1:09:59.980 --> 1:10:06.700]  foils, as their queslings, as their front man, as their shields, as their birdcage liner.
[1:10:06.700 --> 1:10:11.380]  Now, speaking of real world tyranny, here's Buddha judge. He said this a few months ago.
[1:10:11.380 --> 1:10:16.100]  He said it a few weeks ago. He said it again yesterday. He said, until we achieve a form
[1:10:16.100 --> 1:10:20.380]  of energy independence that is based on clean energy, no such thing. They blocked all the
[1:10:20.380 --> 1:10:26.340]  real stuff. You will continue to see price hikes. It's happening because of inflation
[1:10:26.340 --> 1:10:32.380]  and devaluation of the dollar and policies moving the world away from dollars. That's
[1:10:32.380 --> 1:10:38.300]  the reason and blocking oil pipelines and blocking oil and gas exploration. That's why
[1:10:38.300 --> 1:10:43.140]  it's happening, Buddha judge. But people are like, Hey, he's married to a dude. So we got
[1:10:43.140 --> 1:10:47.700]  to do whatever he says. It's like the new Supreme Court nominee. Oh, she's a black woman. So
[1:10:47.700 --> 1:10:55.060]  she's allowed to say it's okay to torture babies to death. It's so cool. It's so amazing.
[1:10:55.060 --> 1:11:01.980]  Look, he's a little nerdly dude, but he's married to a guy. So it's okay. As if I even
[1:11:01.980 --> 1:11:07.700]  care what he does in his life. No wonder he's into dudes. You can't get women. The point
[1:11:07.700 --> 1:11:13.060]  is, is that that doesn't give him an excuse to rape me and my family because he's a chicken
[1:11:13.060 --> 1:11:20.780]  neck little nerd. Let's let's hear from this buck toothed monster.
[1:11:20.780 --> 1:11:26.100]  It's less dependent on foreign oil and that protects us from shortages at fuel stations.
[1:11:26.100 --> 1:11:30.380]  But here's the thing to remember, even if all of the oil we use in the USA were made
[1:11:30.380 --> 1:11:35.740]  in the USA, the price of it is still subject to powers and dynamics outside of the USA,
[1:11:35.740 --> 1:11:40.460]  which means that until we achieve a form of energy independence that is based on clean
[1:11:40.460 --> 1:11:46.140]  energy created here at home, American citizens will still be vulnerable to wild price hikes
[1:11:46.140 --> 1:11:53.500]  like we're seeing right now. Unbelievable. The Grinch that stole Christmas. Bankruptcy.
[1:11:53.500 --> 1:12:00.180]  People losing their lives. This is the guy that gets out of three armored SUVs and then
[1:12:00.180 --> 1:12:06.500]  gets on a bike to ride a hundred yards for a photo op. He's a joke and he hides behind
[1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:15.100]  the fact that he likes Oscar Mayer winners. What does that have to do with him and his
[1:12:15.100 --> 1:12:19.940]  policy? You can't question him. Oh, he has sex with dudes. Oh my gosh. It's like Tim
[1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:22.980]  Cook. Well, Tim Cook runs the biggest death camps in the world, but he does wear black
[1:12:22.980 --> 1:12:31.540]  sweaters, turtlenecks and and he, you know, he is gay. Oh, well, it's like the Indian guy
[1:12:31.540 --> 1:12:37.220]  that owns the warriors. He said, I don't care if there's death camps, kill all those Muslims.
[1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:41.300]  Everybody went, well, I mean, he's got brown skin. You know, it's like, well, if you got
[1:12:41.300 --> 1:12:47.540]  brown skin and you're gay, you know, we've got Katanji Brown Jackson chooses leniency
[1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:53.460]  even in baby sex torture cases. Well, I mean, you know, baby torture sex is okay if she's
[1:12:53.460 --> 1:12:58.900]  black. Okay. And Buddha judge is gay. So, you know, I mean, we've got to and the warriors
[1:12:58.900 --> 1:13:04.620]  guys got brown skin. So it's like, hey, hey, death camps are all right as long as they're
[1:13:04.620 --> 1:13:11.260]  endorsed by somebody with brown skin. Because as we know, only white, straight white people
[1:13:11.260 --> 1:13:17.540]  I'm sorry, straight white people are bad. Like Martin Luther King told us only judge
[1:13:17.540 --> 1:13:24.140]  people on their skin color. Do not judge people on the character of their life or their deeds.
[1:13:24.140 --> 1:13:29.780]  Don't judge them on their job performance. That's racist. Judge people on their sexual
[1:13:29.780 --> 1:13:38.140]  orientation. What color their skin is. And you know, if you're a creepy looking day that
[1:13:38.140 --> 1:13:42.780]  says they're a woman, why not be a four star admiral? Hell, he may say he's Ali Baba. They
[1:13:42.780 --> 1:13:48.180]  say he's the genie of Aladdin's lamp. And they say, I mean, they may say that the Dr. Rachel
[1:13:48.180 --> 1:13:55.540]  Levine is a whale or an Easter Bunny. Hell, hell, hell. Dr. Levine, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:13:55.540 --> 1:14:01.220]  isn't just a man posing as a woman posing as an admiral. He's Santa Claus. He's gonna
[1:14:01.220 --> 1:14:08.860]  wear that admiral outfit that's got an anchor on the hat. These federal agencies. I love
[1:14:08.860 --> 1:14:13.460]  the left made fun of Space Force. When the Air Force actually has a big space weapons
[1:14:13.460 --> 1:14:17.500]  platform and Trump wanted to expand it. They said, Oh, that's ridiculous. Look, they're
[1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:21.620]  wearing Space Force uniforms. That group doesn't exist, even though it's like the most important
[1:14:21.620 --> 1:14:30.180]  asset the US has. And then he's up there with a with a with a with a navy admiral outfit.
[1:14:30.180 --> 1:14:34.500]  Saying he's really wants to save trans kids. And I've got the Jeopardy winner, the guy
[1:14:34.500 --> 1:14:39.740]  that won Jeopardy that poses as a woman. That dude is saying kids will die if they don't
[1:14:39.740 --> 1:14:45.140]  get these life saving surgeries. Like if we don't cut seven year old genitals off or give
[1:14:45.140 --> 1:14:53.700]  them puberty blockers. Oh my God. Oh my God. If we don't do that, children will die, says
[1:14:53.700 --> 1:14:58.660]  the creepy weirdo that wants to talk about our children all day. You know, used to weird
[1:14:58.660 --> 1:15:03.460]  dudes wearing wigs that wanted to talk about children. They were in Alfred Hitchcock movies
[1:15:03.460 --> 1:15:10.260]  like Psycho. They had their mother dead mummified in the basement. You know, but but now Oh,
[1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:19.500]  ah, yes. Yo, look at that woman won Jeopardy. Oh my God. No woman had ever won Jeopardy.
[1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:23.540]  Women are smart, but statistically, the factoids, it's like men can't have babies. No woman
[1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:33.580]  had ever beaten the male champion. But you know what? Finally a woman rose to the top.
[1:15:33.580 --> 1:15:41.380]  And there she is stunning, brave, amazing. And again, with the White House seal behind
[1:15:41.380 --> 1:15:47.700]  him, just like the Admiral outfits. It's like, again, hey, I bet the kids are sitting
[1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:53.700]  in his lap. If you wore a Santa Claus outfit, have you guys thought where do the kids sit?
[1:15:53.700 --> 1:15:56.460]  Santa Claus is left. You want the kids to sit in your lap?
[1:15:56.460 --> 1:16:03.820]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part Founder series at 1776 coin
[1:16:03.820 --> 1:16:09.500]  dot com or info or store dot com. And the second installment is the Tree of Liberty. Thomas
[1:16:09.500 --> 1:16:14.020]  Jefferson quote must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants. The coin I designed
[1:16:14.020 --> 1:16:18.940]  them very, very proud of it. And it will end up being a collectible. I know that the first
[1:16:18.940 --> 1:16:24.180]  coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it. We
[1:16:24.180 --> 1:16:29.820]  need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly. And I appreciate listeners getting
[1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:33.900]  over half of them now. I'd like to lose them out very quickly. I think they will sell out
[1:16:33.900 --> 1:16:40.300]  probably in five or six more days. And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating
[1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:43.380]  at the same capacity. We'd have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem.
[1:16:43.380 --> 1:16:47.540]  So it was a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[1:16:47.540 --> 1:16:51.540]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems. So please give yourself
[1:16:51.540 --> 1:16:58.540]  and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776 coin dot com. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:16:58.540 --> 1:17:03.460]  I need your help. I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong. I need your
[1:17:03.460 --> 1:17:08.740]  help making sure that our mission continues on. I was born for this. You were born for
[1:17:08.740 --> 1:17:14.020]  this and people are really waking up right now. But we had to build our own infrastructure
[1:17:14.020 --> 1:17:18.420]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars. And
[1:17:18.420 --> 1:17:23.220]  now with Bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for
[1:17:23.220 --> 1:17:29.900]  thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[1:17:29.900 --> 1:17:36.460]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22 info wars and Bandot video have
[1:17:36.460 --> 1:17:41.980]  become a mothership promoting the pro human liberty movement worldwide. But the expenses
[1:17:41.980 --> 1:17:46.460]  in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[1:17:46.460 --> 1:17:50.780]  of dollars a month. So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now the mega
[1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:56.220]  emergency blowout sale up to 75% off getting credible products and keep info wars as strong
[1:17:56.220 --> 1:18:03.740]  as ever. Ladies and gentlemen, info wars store.com is offering the biggest sales in its over
[1:18:03.740 --> 1:18:10.860]  20 year history. And that is because the economy is breaking down inflation is exploding, the
[1:18:10.860 --> 1:18:16.980]  supply chains have broken down and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll
[1:18:16.980 --> 1:18:21.620]  and paying for operations. And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the
[1:18:21.620 --> 1:18:26.580]  globalist making their main move in full wars. It's paradoxical is more popular than ever
[1:18:26.580 --> 1:18:31.500]  is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship. But because of cost increasing
[1:18:31.500 --> 1:18:34.900]  and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth everything else,
[1:18:34.900 --> 1:18:41.860]  we are running out of money soliciting up to 75% off info wars store.com on things like

[1:19:59.300 --> 1:20:28.100]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.100 --> 1:20:33.700]  It really is unspeakable that the Supreme Court nominee, I can care less, she's a black
[1:20:33.700 --> 1:20:38.260]  lady, man, in fact, I'd love to, she's a black lady and pro gun, pro family, pro America.
[1:20:38.260 --> 1:20:43.380]  Then we could like stop using race as a weapon in this country of control, but that's not
[1:20:43.380 --> 1:20:48.180]  going to happen. And so they're trying to ram this individual through. Meanwhile, we
[1:20:48.180 --> 1:20:53.340]  have just incredible new levels of censorship going on here in the United States. But we've
[1:20:53.340 --> 1:20:59.700]  seen Elon Musk criticize in great detail, the censorship and woke culture. He's seen
[1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:04.260]  it Twitter. So here's where I stand on this.
[1:21:04.260 --> 1:21:08.860]  We have band on video. We have info wars.com. I believe in building our own things, though
[1:21:08.860 --> 1:21:13.660]  the left has tried to shut those down. But yes, Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and
[1:21:13.660 --> 1:21:19.820]  Google, all of those groups have section 230 immunity because they operate as a utility
[1:21:19.820 --> 1:21:24.540]  that unless you break the law, they don't take you down. And so we should go back to
[1:21:24.540 --> 1:21:31.260]  the free internet post Alex Jones ban of four and a half years ago. And Elon Musk has been
[1:21:31.260 --> 1:21:39.940]  saying that now he's gotten the largest share at 9.2%. It's not a controlling share. And
[1:21:39.940 --> 1:21:42.980]  I don't want to get back on Twitter.
[1:21:42.980 --> 1:21:47.660]  Just so I can reach more people just for me, though I would like to, I would like to get
[1:21:47.660 --> 1:21:53.140]  back on it as a symbol of freedom and then have some real rules that are defined like
[1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:59.740]  don't call for violence, you know, nothing illegal, things like that.
[1:21:59.740 --> 1:22:09.020]  So let's see Twitter stock surge. It's on info wars.com after Elon Musk buys 9% stake.
[1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:15.740]  And he's been saying he wants to either reform Twitter or create his own Twitter. So that
[1:22:15.740 --> 1:22:20.380]  would go a long way in his positive column. He's come out against force inoculation. He
[1:22:20.380 --> 1:22:23.940]  says he doesn't like the vaccine. That was a big positive thing. He says he doesn't like
[1:22:23.940 --> 1:22:28.020]  the globalist. He doesn't like well culture.
[1:22:28.020 --> 1:22:34.820]  That's a good move. His brain ship plan creeps creeps me out, but he's not saying you've
[1:22:34.820 --> 1:22:38.620]  got to be made to take the brain ship. He just says if you want one, he's going to be the
[1:22:38.620 --> 1:22:46.220]  big pioneer that is at the tip of the spear, uh, letting you get that. And you know, my
[1:22:46.220 --> 1:22:54.020]  uncle, my dad's brother has a, uh, implant that goes into his brain, really bad epilepsy
[1:22:54.020 --> 1:22:58.620]  from a motorcycle accident. He doesn't just have the one that stimulates the Vegas nerve.
[1:22:58.620 --> 1:23:02.100]  He's got the more advanced one. First he had that one, then he got another one that's more
[1:23:02.100 --> 1:23:07.780]  advanced that actually goes up into the brain. And man, when he starts to have a seizure,
[1:23:07.780 --> 1:23:11.860]  which is a lot of the time, he'll be sitting there for dinner with him. He'll be like,
[1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:16.980]  you know, I really had a good time the other day visiting your cousin. He'll go, and I'm
[1:23:16.980 --> 1:23:23.100]  going to do it. He sounds like sling blade, but it's, it's like computerized and they'll
[1:23:23.100 --> 1:23:27.980]  go and then he never even knows it happened. So when his brain starts having those brain
[1:23:27.980 --> 1:23:33.780]  waves that show he's about to have a seizure, that thing kicks in. So I'm not against technology
[1:23:33.780 --> 1:23:40.540]  if it's transparent, if you have free will, if you choose it, but all the technology,
[1:23:40.540 --> 1:23:46.900]  the globalists are selling us and pushing on us is absolutely nightmarish. But I got
[1:23:46.900 --> 1:23:49.740]  to go visit my uncle sometime in East Texas. I was just there a few months ago with him
[1:23:49.740 --> 1:23:53.620]  having dinner and having five or six times over a few hours and just put a camera on
[1:23:53.620 --> 1:23:58.860]  him. So when it happens, you can see it for yourself. We were sitting there playing dominoes.
[1:23:58.860 --> 1:24:07.300]  He's talking, yeah, and I tell you, it's great day. All right. It's like, whoa, you can hear
[1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:13.900]  the digital, whatever it's doing to his brain. It's crazy. So we live in the 21st century.
[1:24:13.900 --> 1:24:24.740]  We live in Buck Rogers land. This is, this is where we are. And it really is incredible
[1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:29.300]  to realize that we've got all these different systems that are godlike in their power, but
[1:24:29.300 --> 1:24:33.900]  we're still just the same humans that have been killing each other and living in squalor
[1:24:33.900 --> 1:24:45.980]  and barbarism since the beginning of time. Well, cracks are starting to really show.
[1:24:45.980 --> 1:24:50.900]  And there's an article out of town hall pointing out that Biden in most polls has below a 30
[1:24:50.900 --> 1:24:57.580]  point approval rating is better polls mid 30s. And they asked the question, it's like Democrats
[1:24:57.580 --> 1:25:06.260]  want to be crushed in November. But no, no, no, they have a job as blackmailed compromised
[1:25:06.260 --> 1:25:13.500]  controlled minions to bankrupt America to get control of us. They're just front people
[1:25:13.500 --> 1:25:17.860]  for the big banks and the great reset that's on record doing this. So people look at them
[1:25:17.860 --> 1:25:20.940]  and go, why are they going to get their own interests? Why are they going to get their
[1:25:20.940 --> 1:25:26.420]  own children's interest? Why are they destroying themselves? It's because their puppets, their
[1:25:26.420 --> 1:25:35.060]  minions, they do what they're told. Stop looking at Biden as if he runs something. Yeah, dislike
[1:25:35.060 --> 1:25:41.980]  him. Yeah, get rid of him. Yeah, politically expose them. But realize he's a minion. If
[1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:46.620]  some organized crime gang kidnapped your wife or something, you would you be mad at the
[1:25:46.620 --> 1:25:50.300]  guy that did the kidnapping? Yeah, but you'd want to know what group did it who the head
[1:25:50.300 --> 1:25:56.620]  of that cartel was. Because you'd want to put heat on them to give you your wife back.
[1:25:56.620 --> 1:26:02.100]  It's the same thing. But if a crime cartel could just commit crimes and not known, not
[1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:07.340]  have it known that it exists, like the Italian mafia had until the 50s, they were blackmailing
[1:26:07.340 --> 1:26:12.860]  Jagger Hoover. They get away with anything. But as soon as they were exposed, now their
[1:26:12.860 --> 1:26:17.420]  agency had to stop being on the payroll of the Italian mafia. There were other mafias
[1:26:17.420 --> 1:26:24.500]  too, and had to start actually doing something, at least on the surface. We're going to go
[1:26:24.500 --> 1:26:27.860]  to break, ladies and gentlemen, and come back with Paul Joseph Watson. He is loaded for
[1:26:27.860 --> 1:26:32.100]  bear. Also, we're going to have the great Owen Schreuer in here. Please remember the
[1:26:32.100 --> 1:26:36.700]  only way we stay on air is your support. And I am extremely excited that a product that
[1:26:36.700 --> 1:26:42.860]  I thought I might have to discontinue because of supply chain breakdowns, because we get
[1:26:42.860 --> 1:26:46.820]  it from France through an American distributor is available again, because I put the money
[1:26:46.820 --> 1:26:52.020]  in 11 months ago to get this, almost demanded it back a few months ago. And they said, no,
[1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:56.060]  France is open back up in the rural farm that makes it, you're going to get it. And they
[1:26:56.060 --> 1:27:00.740]  documented it over the last 100 years. It does better in a lot of different studies
[1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:05.020]  and tests than even over the counter antihistamines and things. It's all natural. It is the shells
[1:27:05.020 --> 1:27:10.300]  of a special type of quail that a special diet where they learned and had a major anti-allergy
[1:27:10.300 --> 1:27:15.180]  effect, helps support healthy sinus function, helps enhance respiratory function, pollen
[1:27:15.180 --> 1:27:19.620]  block, promotes clear airway passages in normal breathing, promotes respiratory health and
[1:27:19.620 --> 1:27:25.580]  normal breathing, supports eye comfort and sinus health. Quail egg extract decades ago,
[1:27:25.580 --> 1:27:30.380]  researchers in France discovered the ability for certain quail eggs to alleviate season
[1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:37.500]  related symptoms when eaten. And it is powerful. And despite the fact it'll sell out before
[1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:43.100]  ever get more of it in, I'm offering it out of the gates, 40% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:27:43.100 --> 1:27:49.940]  We're also going to end the sale at the end of the week for vaso beats, beat concentrate
[1:27:49.940 --> 1:27:53.500]  that's documented so good for your heart, creates nitrous oxide in the bloods, wonderful
[1:27:53.500 --> 1:27:58.260]  your cardiovascular system, fights blood clots, everything. That is back in stock 40% off

[1:28:08.340 --> 1:28:14.140]  You need the two together. It is back in stock. It is 40% off. That sale is going to be ending
[1:28:14.140 --> 1:28:18.180]  on Monday or so because we've already sold out a lot of the stock. And we're trying to
[1:28:18.180 --> 1:28:22.660]  again, reach our underages with things we don't have in stock anymore that people buy
[1:28:22.660 --> 1:28:27.900]  by selling out of the t-shirts. And we had 63,000 t-shirts over the last few years. I
[1:28:27.900 --> 1:28:32.140]  ordered and did and never promoted or sold. So we had a lot of, you know, some t-shirts
[1:28:32.140 --> 1:28:35.700]  sold well, some didn't. So we had a lot of them just building up. Some of the best sellers
[1:28:35.700 --> 1:28:39.580]  are there as well. We're never going to reprint any of these. We'll have all new shirts after
[1:28:39.580 --> 1:28:45.180]  this. And I appreciate everybody coming through. We've already sold out 20% of the stock. So
[1:28:45.180 --> 1:28:48.340]  in another week or two, we should sell out of all these t-shirts your last chance to
[1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:52.900]  get them ever. We're selling them at cost at infowarstore.com. Thank you for your support.

[1:29:01.340 --> 1:29:07.060]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days. Now the second
[1:29:07.060 --> 1:29:14.540]  coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered. And I believe
[1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:18.620]  it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and because
[1:29:18.620 --> 1:29:23.500]  our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines of the
[1:29:23.500 --> 1:29:31.740]  fight against these tyrants. So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree

[1:30:05.820 --> 1:30:11.780]  coin and it's sold out in 10 days. And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original
[1:30:11.780 --> 1:30:17.980]  powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today. Now the second
[1:30:17.980 --> 1:30:24.500]  coin, the Liberty Tree coin is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[1:30:24.500 --> 1:30:29.780]  It certainly needs to the front of operation. It is so historic and it has a quote from
[1:30:29.780 --> 1:30:33.980]  Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of Patriots
[1:30:33.980 --> 1:30:41.220]  and tyrants and more. See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com. It's also at info wars store

[1:30:57.700 --> 1:31:04.700]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible. Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates,
[1:31:04.700 --> 1:31:11.020]  Joe Biden, they along with many other new older operatives have gone on national television
[1:31:11.020 --> 1:31:16.420]  and announced that we are now under a world government. They have a summit taking place
[1:31:16.420 --> 1:31:21.740]  right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit and they are announcing incredible
[1:31:21.740 --> 1:31:26.100]  tyranny. Everything we've talked about is now coming true and the globalists want to
[1:31:26.100 --> 1:31:31.620]  take us off air. Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history
[1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:38.180]  of info wars right now. In our 28 years, all info wars apparel is being sold at cost until

[1:31:42.700 --> 1:31:46.860]  info wars flags again. We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future, but I don't even
[1:31:46.860 --> 1:31:51.300]  know. We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now. I'm firing

[1:33:10.140 --> 1:33:16.740]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[1:33:16.740 --> 1:33:25.020]  And now your host, Owen Troyer. And I will be in studio and I've got, well, you could
[1:33:25.020 --> 1:33:31.500]  say maybe some big announcements coming up, but you should be supporting info wars now
[1:33:31.500 --> 1:33:37.300]  more than ever. I'll explain why coming up in the next hour. But we have Paul Joseph
[1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:42.620]  Watson dialed in ready to go. He's been all over the Ukraine situation. He's got great
[1:33:42.620 --> 1:33:46.140]  guests coming up today too. He's going to be live hosting the next hour or so of the
[1:33:46.140 --> 1:33:50.540]  Alex Jones show. I'll be right here in studio as well. Paul Joseph Watson, take it away.
[1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:56.540]  Thanks, Owen. Yeah, we got a guest coming up at the top of the hour, somebody who's tried
[1:33:56.540 --> 1:34:02.220]  to pass the propaganda on both sides and get to the truth of what is actually taking place
[1:34:02.220 --> 1:34:07.820]  in Ukraine with these alleged atrocities. Who's responsible for them? Are they actually
[1:34:07.820 --> 1:34:13.340]  happening? Because of course, we've got this massive new push for war over the past few
[1:34:13.340 --> 1:34:20.380]  days. MSNBC, CBS, all calling for both their guests and their hosts, by the way. No flies
[1:34:20.380 --> 1:34:26.820]  owns American boots on the ground because of another alleged war crime. They're also talking
[1:34:26.820 --> 1:34:34.860]  about mass graves, which is post we saw back in 2003, 2004, with the invasion of Iraq that
[1:34:34.860 --> 1:34:39.660]  was justified partly by weapons of mass destruction claims, which turned out to be completely
[1:34:39.660 --> 1:34:48.780]  BS, phony baloney. And of course, claims of mass graves containing one report was 400,000
[1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:55.220]  people killed and put into mass graves by Saddam Hussein's regime turned out to be absolute
[1:34:55.220 --> 1:35:02.660]  crap, which is why we need an ounce of skepticism. We don't just take reports, videos filmed
[1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:10.300]  by Ukrainian soldiers of quote war crimes, amplify them without any study whatsoever.
[1:35:10.300 --> 1:35:15.980]  But of course, that's what's happening across the entire pro-Ukraine Western media today.
[1:35:15.980 --> 1:35:19.900]  I've got a guest, as I said, coming on at the top of the hour who has followed more
[1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:24.780]  intensely than anyone, I would say sources on the ground on both sides, both the Ukrainian
[1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:31.380]  side and the Russian side to try to deduce the truth of what is happening.
[1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:36.780]  Headline Russia claims Booker massacre of false flag as US media calls for direct military
[1:35:36.780 --> 1:35:42.980]  involvement in conflict. Remember the biggest lobbyist for the escalation of this war, apart
[1:35:42.980 --> 1:35:49.300]  from defense contractors and ex generals on Fox News and people like that is left wing
[1:35:49.300 --> 1:35:55.300]  quote progressive journalists themselves. And we saw that again on MSNBC and CBS Today,
[1:35:55.300 --> 1:35:59.340]  or yesterday over the weekend. Russia has responded to claims that its forces committed
[1:35:59.340 --> 1:36:03.700]  war crimes by brutally murdering civilians in a town called Kiev, calling the incident
[1:36:03.700 --> 1:36:08.740]  fake or key. Sorry, as we've got to call it now. Suddenly started everyone start calling
[1:36:08.740 --> 1:36:12.620]  it key for a few months ago. I'm not going to do that. Calling the incident fake and
[1:36:12.620 --> 1:36:17.620]  labeling its orchestration as a staged false flag provocation. Of course they're going
[1:36:17.620 --> 1:36:21.900]  to do that. They're being accused of it. But how do we know who's telling the truth?
[1:36:21.900 --> 1:36:28.740]  Well, we don't. So we don't just mindlessly amplify news stories as real because of videos
[1:36:28.740 --> 1:36:36.660]  handed to the Western pro NATO media by Ukraine by President Zelensky. Obviously they have
[1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:43.340]  a motivation to try to push America and the NATO powers into helping them escalate this
[1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:48.580]  war Zelensky has called for a no fly zone every step of the way. It seemed that those
[1:36:48.580 --> 1:36:55.780]  calls were dying down. They were waning will now they're very much back front and center.
[1:36:55.780 --> 1:37:02.460]  Article continues the mayor of a book of this town, this region shared footage and photographs
[1:37:02.460 --> 1:37:08.940]  of dead bodies strewn about the streets of Booker, which is 23 miles northwest of Kiev.
[1:37:08.940 --> 1:37:14.020]  Now what's interesting is that the same mayor, I believe it was two days before announced
[1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:19.860]  with great fanfare, by the way, by the way, that Booker had been liberated. And during
[1:37:19.860 --> 1:37:26.100]  his announcement, there was no mention of any war crimes, any atrocities committed
[1:37:26.100 --> 1:37:32.060]  by the Russians. You think he'd be the first to use his platform to point the finger at
[1:37:32.060 --> 1:37:38.180]  the Russians for these supposed dead bodies that were strewn all over the area, tied up,
[1:37:38.180 --> 1:37:42.980]  executed, cold blank. You think he'd be pushing that front and center? Well, he didn't two
[1:37:42.980 --> 1:37:50.660]  days beforehand. He announced that the town was liberated and made no mention of atrocities.
[1:37:50.660 --> 1:37:57.020]  Then the highly heralded as of neo Nazi group who apparently are completely acceptable and
[1:37:57.020 --> 1:38:02.580]  fine now because they're our neo Nazis. The media is now even calling them far right. They've
[1:38:02.580 --> 1:38:08.500]  stripped the neo Nazi from them entirely. They entered Booker the day after the mayor
[1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:14.500]  announced the town was liberated. Then the day after that the UK Ministry of Defense receives
[1:38:14.500 --> 1:38:21.660]  these videos from the Ukrainian government of alleged Russian atrocities. Now are you
[1:38:21.660 --> 1:38:27.300]  a Kremlin stooge if you don't immediately swallow 100% of this narrative that they're
[1:38:27.300 --> 1:38:33.620]  trying to feed as well. Even the New York Times said it was quote, unable to independently
[1:38:33.620 --> 1:38:40.060]  verify the assertions by Ukraine's Defense Ministry and other officials. So the New York
[1:38:40.060 --> 1:38:44.620]  Times came out and said we've just been given these videos again filmed by the Ukrainian
[1:38:44.620 --> 1:38:49.860]  authorities. This is what they say happened. They say it so it must be true, right? They
[1:38:49.860 --> 1:38:55.740]  have no motivation to lie about it. And this is how the US legacy media responded in the
[1:38:55.740 --> 1:39:02.180]  hours after this story emerged. Let's go to clip one CBS Margaret Brennan and know how
[1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:09.100]  she frames how she received or how the network received this alleged war crime atrocity footage.
[1:39:09.100 --> 1:39:16.260]  CBS Margaret Brennan. Here's the clip. Mr President, your team shared with us a video
[1:39:16.260 --> 1:39:21.740]  images that your government has gathered of what has been left behind outside of Kiev
[1:39:21.740 --> 1:39:26.940]  that I do want to share with our viewers. And I want to ask you about it. Looking and
[1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:31.060]  listening to what Vladimir Putin has said, he's called Ukraine not a real country. He
[1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:36.460]  said it's controlled by little Nazis. He's called you a drug addict. Is he someone you
[1:39:36.460 --> 1:39:48.660]  can negotiate with? Now, I know how she framed that at the start. These videos, this footage
[1:39:48.660 --> 1:39:54.540]  that was shared with us by Ukraine officials by President Zelensky. Again, none of it's
[1:39:54.540 --> 1:40:00.700]  been independently investigated or corroborated. They were just given the footage and they
[1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:09.020]  swallowed the narrative, amplified it, regurgitated it. But MSNBC's Ali Velshi went even further
[1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:14.420]  using this footage, these alleged atrocities, wholesale point blank just claiming that they
[1:40:14.420 --> 1:40:19.500]  happened exactly as the Ukrainian officials said they happened, not even having announced
[1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:23.860]  a nuance for understanding that they would have the motivation to escalate the war by
[1:40:23.860 --> 1:40:29.300]  saying this is what happened no matter what happened. He directly called for US military
[1:40:29.300 --> 1:40:34.500]  involvement. This wasn't even a guess. This was the host of the show. MSNBC Ali Velshi
[1:40:34.500 --> 1:40:36.300]  clip two. Here it is.
[1:40:36.300 --> 1:40:41.540]  Pass the point of sanctions and strongly worded condemnations in the seizing of oligarchs
[1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:46.700]  mega yachts. It's no longer sufficient as the evidence of war crimes and crimes against
[1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:52.100]  humanity continue to grow. Vladimir Putin has no regard for life or humanity or even
[1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:57.700]  the rules of war. He's proven that time and time again, and he has also pursued the indiscriminate
[1:40:57.700 --> 1:41:04.140]  killing of civilians time and time again twice before in Ukraine and in Chechnya. The global
[1:41:04.140 --> 1:41:08.820]  world order and potentially democracy's survival hang in the balance. If this isn't the kind
[1:41:08.820 --> 1:41:14.780]  of moment that the United Nations and NATO and the UN and the G20 and the Council of
[1:41:14.780 --> 1:41:21.700]  Europe and the G7 were made for, what is the point of these alliances if not to stop this?
[1:41:21.700 --> 1:41:28.620]  The world cannot sit by as Vladimir Putin continues this reign of terror.
[1:41:28.620 --> 1:41:33.740]  They have it. The global world order needs military escalation, which of course will
[1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:38.860]  almost inevitably lead to World War Three, but not to be outdone. John Spencer then went
[1:41:38.860 --> 1:41:44.260]  on the same show called not only for military escalation, but American boots on the ground.
[1:41:44.260 --> 1:41:46.060]  Clip three. Here it is.
[1:41:46.060 --> 1:41:52.380]  Hey, look, I know what this means. I know what I'm saying. I served for 25 years. I served
[1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:57.300]  to protect the innocent. We are the leaders of the free world. So yes, and my wife still
[1:41:57.300 --> 1:42:02.420]  serves. I don't speak for her, but I'm ready to commit at this moment, unlike I was before
[1:42:02.420 --> 1:42:09.660]  this day, to put people in direct contact with Russia, to stop Russia. Call it peacekeeping.
[1:42:09.660 --> 1:42:14.140]  Call it what you will. We have to do more than provide weapons. And by we, I mean the
[1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:18.580]  United States. Yes, we're going to do it as a coalition with lots of other people. But
[1:42:18.580 --> 1:42:25.380]  we are the example. So put boots on the ground, send weapons directly at Russia. This is
[1:42:25.380 --> 1:42:29.100]  a massacre. This is a special kind of evil.
[1:42:29.100 --> 1:42:35.580]  So there you have it. Immediately again, swallowing, regurgitating the narrative. But
[1:42:35.580 --> 1:42:41.420]  unlike CBS, unlike MSNBC, we're going to come back on the other side and ask a few basic
[1:42:41.420 --> 1:42:47.740]  pointed questions about what actually happened in this town of Booker, who is responsible
[1:42:47.740 --> 1:42:52.100]  and how that is going to affect things going forward. We'll be back on the other side.
[1:42:52.100 --> 1:42:58.100]  Don't go away.
[1:42:58.100 --> 1:43:02.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. I need your help keeping info wars on the air
[1:43:02.300 --> 1:43:08.540]  and strong. I need your help making sure that our mission continues on. I was born for this.
[1:43:08.540 --> 1:43:13.020]  You were born for this. And people are really waking up right now. But we had to build our
[1:43:13.020 --> 1:43:18.060]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions
[1:43:18.060 --> 1:43:23.420]  of dollars. And now with Bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:29.340]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[1:43:29.340 --> 1:43:36.660]  of charge. And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22 info wars and Bandot video
[1:43:36.660 --> 1:43:41.220]  have become a mothership promoting the pro human liberty movement worldwide. But the
[1:43:41.220 --> 1:43:46.300]  expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[1:43:46.300 --> 1:43:50.780]  of thousands of dollars a month. So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[1:43:50.780 --> 1:43:55.740]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off getting credible products and keep info
[1:43:55.740 --> 1:43:57.780]  wars as strong as ever.
[1:43:57.780 --> 1:44:03.180]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even
[1:44:03.180 --> 1:44:08.700]  though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[1:44:08.700 --> 1:44:13.820]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what

[1:45:03.820 --> 1:45:04.820]  Good.

[1:45:09.340 --> 1:45:14.060]  the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.

[1:46:58.740 --> 1:47:13.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:13.860 --> 1:47:22.380]  You know, dealing with the liberal left cultural decay would be kind of funny if it wasn't
[1:47:22.380 --> 1:47:27.700]  the total destruction of the future. If it wasn't the total annihilation of our prosperity,
[1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:34.180]  it would be kind of funny because they do things like this. I mean, this is just hilarious.
[1:47:34.180 --> 1:47:40.460]  New York City announces a new digital billboard campaign in five Florida markets denouncing
[1:47:40.460 --> 1:47:45.580]  the hateful don't say gay law, which doesn't even exist, and inviting Floridians to move
[1:47:45.580 --> 1:47:49.020]  New York. Of course, the exact opposite is happening. People are leaving New York and
[1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:53.860]  droves going to Florida, and they think that this billboard that says gay on it about a
[1:47:53.860 --> 1:47:59.140]  thousand times, just gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, literally, and it says, come to the city where
[1:47:59.140 --> 1:48:03.300]  you can say whatever you want. Oh, Democrats are free speech again? Democrats are pro free
[1:48:03.300 --> 1:48:09.580]  speech again? Huh. That's an interesting one. So yeah, you know, Paul, it'd be funny to
[1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:14.420]  deal with these people if their cultural rot wasn't going to destroy the future for humanity,
[1:48:14.420 --> 1:48:18.260]  it'd be kind of fun making fun of them with their little gay virtue signaling and Ukrainian
[1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:22.500]  virtue signaling, whatever else they do. But following these people means the annihilation
[1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:27.460]  of humanity. So we kind of struggled to laugh. But Paul Joseph Watson here with us taking
[1:48:27.460 --> 1:48:33.460]  back over now on the Alex Jones show, gay, Paul, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay.
[1:48:33.460 --> 1:48:39.980]  Yeah, it's like thou doth protest too much, isn't it? Interesting with those polls on
[1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:46.140]  that subject where basically a fraction of boomers, a small percentage of Gen X describe
[1:48:46.140 --> 1:48:54.900]  themselves as LGBT. But now 20% of Generation Z describe themselves as LGBT. Now their old
[1:48:54.900 --> 1:49:01.020]  argument used to be, Oh, you're not, you don't choose to be gay, you're born gay. Okay, so
[1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:07.980]  why are huge increases in numbers of people announcing that they're gay based on later
[1:49:07.980 --> 1:49:13.860]  generations if it's all a natural process? Of course, it's because of social engineering.
[1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:19.140]  The algorithms of TikTok promote this LGBT crap, this agenda over and over again. We
[1:49:19.140 --> 1:49:24.020]  had them denying for decades that there even was an LGBT agenda. Now they openly announce
[1:49:24.020 --> 1:49:30.260]  it on Disney with children's programming. So again, they're pushing this lifestyle via
[1:49:30.260 --> 1:49:36.180]  social engineering. The fact is it's an incredibly unhealthy lifestyle. We've seen the depression
[1:49:36.180 --> 1:49:41.980]  rates in gay people, we've seen the suicide rates in transgenders becoming even worse
[1:49:41.980 --> 1:49:47.380]  after they have the dreaded op. So again, it's an incredibly destructive and unhealthy lifestyle
[1:49:47.380 --> 1:49:52.980]  for the individuals who are suckered into adopting it to make themselves look unique
[1:49:52.980 --> 1:49:57.620]  and try to stand out and rebel. The old way to rebel as a youngster was, you know, through
[1:49:57.620 --> 1:50:04.180]  music, through becoming a punk rocker or grunge kid or an emo kid or whatever. It was a phase.
[1:50:04.180 --> 1:50:09.140]  Now the phase goes right the way through to chopping your members off. And that's a very
[1:50:09.140 --> 1:50:13.300]  permanent thing indeed. So we continue to struggle with that. As he said, it's become
[1:50:13.300 --> 1:50:19.180]  no laughing matter. I'm going to get back into Ukraine now though, because before the
[1:50:19.180 --> 1:50:25.100]  break we played those clips, the immediate reaction from the US legacy media to this
[1:50:25.100 --> 1:50:31.820]  claim that 410 bodies, again, hands tied behind their backs shot execution style in this
[1:50:31.820 --> 1:50:38.660]  town in Ukraine, provided to the Western media by Ukrainian troops. Of course, Russia claims
[1:50:38.660 --> 1:50:44.900]  that all their forces left the town of Booker on March 30. Can you believe them? No. They've
[1:50:44.900 --> 1:50:48.860]  got their own propaganda, but why then should we automatically believe the propaganda on
[1:50:48.860 --> 1:50:55.820]  the other side? They claim they left on March 30. What is a fact is that the mayor of Booker
[1:50:55.820 --> 1:51:04.100]  and Attali Fedoruk said in a video address on March 31, two days before these videos
[1:51:04.100 --> 1:51:09.860]  were released and alleged war crimes atrocities in Booker, he said in a video address that
[1:51:09.860 --> 1:51:15.260]  the town was liberated. The Russian soldiers had left. There were no Russian soldiers there
[1:51:15.260 --> 1:51:21.500]  at all. He didn't mention any of these atrocities. If these atrocities had occurred and were
[1:51:21.500 --> 1:51:28.300]  the responsibility of the Russian troops would left on March 30, why on March 31 is he not
[1:51:28.300 --> 1:51:34.660]  mentioning these atrocities? The timeline seems to make very little sense. Let me have
[1:51:34.660 --> 1:51:40.540]  this report out of summit.news. Ukrainian police said they conducted, quote, clearing
[1:51:40.540 --> 1:51:48.100]  operation in Booker a day before the dead body videos emerged. This was a Facebook post
[1:51:48.100 --> 1:51:56.460]  in which the Ukrainian police said, quote, today on 2nd of April in the liberated city
[1:51:56.460 --> 1:52:03.020]  of Booker Kiev region again, basically hours before these atrocity videos were released.
[1:52:03.020 --> 1:52:09.900]  Special units of the Ukrainian national police began clearing the area of saboteurs and accomplices
[1:52:09.900 --> 1:52:15.940]  of Russian troops. Now what's interesting about that is that you get a battalion like
[1:52:15.940 --> 1:52:22.820]  the as off battalion. They declare saboteurs and accomplices collaborators to be anyone
[1:52:22.820 --> 1:52:27.620]  who basically doesn't do what they say. If you don't immediately join up with them and
[1:52:27.620 --> 1:52:33.020]  support the neo-Nazi as off battalion, you are a Russian collaborator. You are subject
[1:52:33.020 --> 1:52:37.300]  to whatever horrors that they're going to inflict on you. So the Ukrainian national
[1:52:37.300 --> 1:52:43.940]  police posted on Facebook that they were involved in liberating, clearing the area and again
[1:52:43.940 --> 1:52:52.060]  made no mention of these 410 dead bodies. Why is the mayor not talking about it? The
[1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:56.740]  day before it happens basically, the day before the videos released at least after Russian
[1:52:56.740 --> 1:53:01.940]  troops have left after they've quote, liberated the town. Why is he not talking about it?
[1:53:01.940 --> 1:53:07.500]  And why is this Ukrainian national police force talking about clearing the area and again
[1:53:07.500 --> 1:53:15.620]  not mentioning these dead bodies, hogtied and shot execution style? And again, not these
[1:53:15.620 --> 1:53:21.340]  questions aren't being asked by MSNBC, CBS, they're just wholesale coming out and saying,
[1:53:21.340 --> 1:53:27.380]  this is it. We've been waiting all along for the mass casualty war crime atrocity. Oh
[1:53:27.380 --> 1:53:33.140]  no, how convenient, we've found it. Finally, now maybe we can get that no fly zone and
[1:53:33.140 --> 1:53:39.560]  that nuclear armageddon that the world really needs. A piece. So we have that explained
[1:53:39.560 --> 1:53:45.500]  in that article. Then we had a bizarre thing happen on Fox News a few nights ago. Headline
[1:53:45.500 --> 1:53:50.740]  out of information liberation.com. They are what they are. They were defending our country.
[1:53:50.740 --> 1:53:56.420]  Zelensky brushes off reports of as off battalion committing atrocities. He basically just
[1:53:56.420 --> 1:54:00.660]  says, well, they may have done some bad things in the past, but then we absorbed them into
[1:54:00.660 --> 1:54:06.020]  the Ukrainian military. And it was absolutely fine. Bear in mind, these battalion fighters
[1:54:06.020 --> 1:54:12.060]  are responsible for those people being again tied up to lamp posts in many Ukrainian cities.
[1:54:12.060 --> 1:54:17.420]  These are Ukrainian civilians for allegedly being Russian collaborators. They've been blamed
[1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:23.580]  for a number of other atrocities. I've now Zelensky is on Fox News saying, well, so what
[1:54:23.580 --> 1:54:28.620]  there are guys, they're the good Nazis. When Fox News is Brett Bear asked President Zelensky
[1:54:28.620 --> 1:54:33.100]  on Friday about reports of as off battalion committing atrocities, Zelensky appeared to
[1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:37.220]  brush them off by saying they are what they are. They were defending our country. And in
[1:54:37.220 --> 1:54:43.780]  fact, we have that clip. It is clip four Zelensky on Fox News. Here it is. I want to have have
[1:54:43.780 --> 1:54:49.940]  you clear something up for us. And this is these reports about the as off battalion that
[1:54:49.940 --> 1:54:56.020]  is said to be Nazi affiliated organization operating as a militia in your country said
[1:54:56.020 --> 1:55:00.700]  to be committing their own atrocities. What should Americans know about that unit about
[1:55:00.700 --> 1:55:09.700]  those reports? So as off was one of those many battalions. They are what they are. They were
[1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:20.420]  defending our country. And later I want to explain to you everything from all the components
[1:55:20.420 --> 1:55:30.140]  of those volunteer battalions later were incorporated into the the military of Ukraine. Those as
[1:55:30.140 --> 1:55:37.260]  off fighters are no longer self established group. They are component of the Ukrainian
[1:55:37.260 --> 1:55:44.900]  military back in 2014. There were situations when our volunteers were encircled. And some
[1:55:44.900 --> 1:55:51.460]  of them did violate laws laws of Ukraine. And they actually were taken to court and
[1:55:51.460 --> 1:56:00.500]  got prison sentences. So law is above all. If one. As emails Miles Chong points out
[1:56:00.500 --> 1:56:05.980]  on Twitter, they were given prison sentences, but sentences, but then they were later overturned
[1:56:05.980 --> 1:56:11.140]  and then absorbed into the Ukrainian military. The interesting thing about that Fox News
[1:56:11.140 --> 1:56:16.660]  clip where he's basically brushing off the question of as off battalion committing atrocities
[1:56:16.660 --> 1:56:23.900]  is that that was taken from the live Fox News broadcast when Fox News uploaded this interview
[1:56:23.900 --> 1:56:29.620]  to both YouTube and Fox News.com. The question and the answer about atrocities being committed
[1:56:29.620 --> 1:56:38.060]  by as off battalion was cut out completely by Fox News. Interesting, isn't it? Meanwhile,
[1:56:38.060 --> 1:56:43.260]  Breitbart reports satellite photos show mass grave in Ukraine. Russia denies involvement.
[1:56:43.260 --> 1:56:49.620]  Yet another claim of a war crime and atrocity. Space imaging company Maxar Technologies published
[1:56:49.620 --> 1:56:54.260]  satellite images over the weekend that appear to show earthworks of a mass grave in the
[1:56:54.260 --> 1:56:59.860]  lake of the withdrawing Russian army at Bukha, Ukraine. So not only do they have the atrocities,
[1:56:59.860 --> 1:57:05.300]  the dead bodies on the street, they have a mass grave too. Reuters report on Sunday,
[1:57:05.300 --> 1:57:08.460]  its journalist on the ground in Bukha had witnessed a mass grave at a church, but could
[1:57:08.460 --> 1:57:15.500]  not confirm it if it was the same site that Maxar satellites pictured. And again, nobody's
[1:57:15.500 --> 1:57:21.660]  denying that there were hundreds of bodies littering the streets of Bukha. I mean, some
[1:57:21.660 --> 1:57:26.180]  people throw up videos and say, oh, that their arms were still moving or whatever. Haven't
[1:57:26.180 --> 1:57:31.220]  seen that. I'm not denying the fact that these atrocities happened. The question is, who
[1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:36.980]  is responsible? The mainstream media has already made up its mind because it's perfect convenient
[1:57:36.980 --> 1:57:42.900]  propaganda to heighten the tensions, to escalate the isolation of Russia and the war and get
[1:57:42.900 --> 1:57:47.260]  the no-fly zone. We'll be back. Don't go away.
[1:57:47.260 --> 1:57:53.180]  We are only offering three coins in the series. The first coin was released in December of
[1:57:53.180 --> 1:57:59.860]  2021 and sold out in 10 days. Now, the second coin as we enter the last days of March into
[1:57:59.860 --> 1:58:06.540]  April 2022 is now being offered. And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again
[1:58:06.540 --> 1:58:11.060]  because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom
[1:58:11.060 --> 1:58:16.660]  and keep info wars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants. So go for yourself

[1:58:49.060 --> 1:58:54.820]  when I say it. It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of
[1:58:54.820 --> 1:59:03.020]  human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human
[1:59:03.020 --> 1:59:10.580]  program. And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of

[2:00:16.300 --> 2:00:35.980]  So we have the claims and counterclaims of atrocity booker reports of mass graves. Of
[2:00:35.980 --> 2:00:39.900]  course I flashed back to this. I talked about it at the start of the show. We had exactly
[2:00:39.900 --> 2:00:46.220]  the same claims during and after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 to 2004. Does that mean that
[2:00:46.220 --> 2:00:50.900]  there isn't a mass grave in booker? Does that mean that the Russians didn't slaughter
[2:00:50.900 --> 2:00:56.580]  400 people execution style leave them on the streets? No. But it means you have to analyze
[2:00:56.580 --> 2:01:03.180]  claims which are clearly motivated by Ukraine's desire to see more military involvement by
[2:01:03.180 --> 2:01:08.580]  NATO powers and no fly zone and an escalation of the war. You can't just let it slip by
[2:01:08.580 --> 2:01:13.340]  completely unchallenged. We're supposed to have a media for a reason. They're supposed
[2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:17.660]  to ask those questions. Of course, as you've seen from Biden's press conferences, they
[2:01:17.660 --> 2:01:22.940]  do the exact opposite. It was like during the COVID press briefings, both in the United
[2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:28.180]  States and in the United Kingdom, where they never questioned whether lockdown was the right
[2:01:28.180 --> 2:01:33.380]  method to take despite the fact that we now in the aftermath of it all have huge studies.
[2:01:33.380 --> 2:01:37.340]  The John Hopkins study and others proving that it was the completely wrong decision
[2:01:37.340 --> 2:01:42.620]  to take that they were on the wrong side of history. It caused more harm than it did good
[2:01:42.620 --> 2:01:48.180]  locking down healthy people and failing to go for herd immunity. As we now see in China,
[2:01:48.180 --> 2:01:53.540]  with that blowing up in their faces, the journalists were supposed to be there to say, why are
[2:01:53.540 --> 2:02:01.420]  you locking down? How can you justify this massive impingement on human freedoms in generations?
[2:02:01.420 --> 2:02:06.300]  They did the exact opposite. They said, why aren't you locking down harder? Why don't you
[2:02:06.300 --> 2:02:11.340]  weld us inside our homes like they're doing China? And they're doing the exact same thing
[2:02:11.340 --> 2:02:18.660]  once again, because there is no truly impartial media left anymore. The fact checkers as well,
[2:02:18.660 --> 2:02:24.740]  the Ministry of Truth, only fact check one side of the equation, the innumerable hoaxes
[2:02:24.740 --> 2:02:30.700]  and staged events that have admittedly occurred during this war, Snake Island, the ghost of
[2:02:30.700 --> 2:02:36.780]  Kiev, the mobile crematoriums that weren't there, the so-called attack on the Holocaust
[2:02:36.780 --> 2:02:42.060]  Memorial in Kiev that didn't happen, Jewish Israeli journalists literally went there the
[2:02:42.060 --> 2:02:48.860]  day after and said it was completely unscathed. Zero fact checks on any of that from any of
[2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:55.540]  the Ministry of Truth fact checkers. And again, there'll be zero inquiry into this. But I flash
[2:02:55.540 --> 2:03:00.020]  back again to the Iraq war again, not saying there isn't a mass grave, not saying that
[2:03:00.020 --> 2:03:05.300]  both sides are committing atrocities. I'm saying you have to ask basic questions when
[2:03:05.300 --> 2:03:10.500]  there's such a devastatingly risky motive involved.
[2:03:10.500 --> 2:03:18.780]  PM admits graves claim untrue. This is a headline from the observer from July 2004. Downing
[2:03:18.780 --> 2:03:23.180]  Street, the British government has admitted to the observer that repeated claims by Tony
[2:03:23.180 --> 2:03:29.980]  Blair that 400,000 bodies have been found in Iraqi mass graves is untrue, and only about
[2:03:29.980 --> 2:03:35.900]  5,000 corpses have been uncovered. Same thing with the 45 minute warning that Blair came
[2:03:35.900 --> 2:03:40.780]  out with before the invasion, saying that Saddam Hussein could attack the United Kingdom
[2:03:40.780 --> 2:03:48.300]  with WMD within 45 minutes. Again, completely made up nonsense. All that came out after
[2:03:48.300 --> 2:03:55.300]  when the first casualty of war is truth, you have to ask basic questions. Pedro Gonzales
[2:03:55.300 --> 2:04:03.380]  tweets. Zelensky lied about Snake Island. No one died. Lied about terrorism at Chernobyl.
[2:04:03.380 --> 2:04:08.300]  Lied about Baba Yar, which is the Holocaust memorial attack confirmed by Israeli journalist
[2:04:08.300 --> 2:04:14.420]  on site. His book, a comment should make us more skeptical of Ukraine's claims. Of course,
[2:04:14.420 --> 2:04:18.980]  we flash back to the Ghouta chemical attack in Syria, alleged attack carried out by Bashar
[2:04:18.980 --> 2:04:25.460]  al-Assad back in August 2013. Used again to increase the drumbeat for war, very nearly
[2:04:25.460 --> 2:04:31.500]  almost justified or greased the skids for US military boots on the ground in Syria. Turns
[2:04:31.500 --> 2:04:37.180]  out it wasn't carried out by Bashar al-Assad's forces. It was carried out by the Western
[2:04:37.180 --> 2:04:43.900]  backed jihadist rebels. Report by MIT found that it was impossible for Assad to have carried
[2:04:43.900 --> 2:04:47.900]  out that attack, but that report only merged the year after.
[2:04:47.900 --> 2:04:52.180]  So these claims have to be investigated, and many times they turn out to be fake. The narrative
[2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:58.700]  is entirely wrong, but be back. Don't go away.
[2:04:58.700 --> 2:05:06.980]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[2:05:06.980 --> 2:05:13.020]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days. And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original,
[2:05:13.020 --> 2:05:19.180]  powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today. Now, the second
[2:05:19.180 --> 2:05:25.660]  coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered, and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[2:05:25.660 --> 2:05:30.980]  It certainly needs to be under operation. It is so historic, and it has a quote from
[2:05:30.980 --> 2:05:35.140]  Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of Patriots
[2:05:35.140 --> 2:05:58.460]  and Tyrants and more.
[2:06:05.140 --> 2:06:18.980]  We are back, and we're going to continue to talk about these alleged atrocities because
[2:06:18.980 --> 2:06:25.220]  you will get no inquiry, skepticism, or nuance from the mainstream legacy media whatsoever.
[2:06:25.220 --> 2:06:29.940]  They've simply seized upon them and said, finally, we have a justification for a no-fly
[2:06:29.940 --> 2:06:35.300]  zone for an escalation. For, as one MSNBC guest called for, as we played the clip in
[2:06:35.300 --> 2:06:41.860]  the last segment, American boots on the ground in Ukraine because that's gone so well before
[2:06:41.860 --> 2:06:46.980]  in the past 60 years, hasn't it? So, again, we're doing the job that the mainstream media
[2:06:46.980 --> 2:06:50.980]  refuses to do. We're not saying that atrocities aren't happening. We're not saying there isn't
[2:06:50.980 --> 2:06:57.100]  a mass graving booker. We're saying, basically, we need to get some independent verification
[2:06:57.100 --> 2:07:02.860]  and try to deduce exactly what happened and who is responsible. To do that, I'm going
[2:07:02.860 --> 2:07:08.780]  to be joined by my guest now, who is Michael Dullabrock. He has an excellent Telegram channel
[2:07:08.780 --> 2:07:16.100]  which everyone needs to follow for in-depth, intense updates on the ground situation in
[2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:20.140]  Ukraine. It is Wuhanka Watch. You can search for that, or you can just search for Michael
[2:07:20.140 --> 2:07:26.580]  Dullabrock on Telegram and follow that channel for the very latest. Michael, welcome to the
[2:07:26.580 --> 2:07:33.820]  show. Hi, Paul. Just check, I'm coming for you, okay? Yep. Yep, loud and clear. Now,
[2:07:33.820 --> 2:07:41.820]  I want to ask you about this alleged atrocity. They say 410 dead bodies found, hands tied
[2:07:41.820 --> 2:07:48.500]  behind their backs, short execution style. There's been absolutely no challenge to this
[2:07:48.500 --> 2:07:53.140]  narrative from the mainstream media. They said they were handed the video, it was by
[2:07:53.140 --> 2:07:58.700]  Zelensky's government. There were reports that they were filmed by Ukrainian troops.
[2:07:58.700 --> 2:08:05.260]  Again, we have reports that the mayor in that town came out two days before these videos
[2:08:05.260 --> 2:08:10.740]  emerged and said the town was liberated. All the Russians have left. He made no mention
[2:08:10.740 --> 2:08:15.740]  of these atrocities. Again, not to say that they didn't happen, but we have to analyze
[2:08:15.740 --> 2:08:20.940]  the timeline here. Moscow has obviously come out and said that it was staged by the Ukrainians.
[2:08:20.940 --> 2:08:25.340]  They say that about everything. From what you've seen, from the sources that you follow
[2:08:25.340 --> 2:08:29.620]  there on the ground, what's the best guess as to what actually happened there and who
[2:08:29.620 --> 2:08:37.460]  was responsible? Yeah, so to sort of round off what appears to have happened in the Bukha
[2:08:37.460 --> 2:08:44.980]  area and in the Hostelman area is obviously the allegation from the Western media propping
[2:08:44.980 --> 2:08:48.820]  up from the Ukrainian government sources is that the Russians have essentially engaged
[2:08:48.820 --> 2:08:56.140]  in a mass murder, a massacre of the local civilian population. I am a bit skeptical
[2:08:56.140 --> 2:09:02.820]  of that on a number of grounds because just looking at some of the footage that have emerged
[2:09:02.820 --> 2:09:10.900]  of the alleged events is that it looks to be separate incidents. Some of the bodies
[2:09:10.900 --> 2:09:15.180]  from what I can see in some of the footage seems to have been there for at least a couple
[2:09:15.180 --> 2:09:20.100]  of weeks. Some of them appear to be fairly fresh, which is what is the main thing propping
[2:09:20.100 --> 2:09:24.180]  up the allegations that the Russians are alleged to have just killed everyone as they left
[2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:31.740]  the town. And then there is this quote unquote mass grave. So the Bukha massacre as such,
[2:09:31.740 --> 2:09:35.980]  it's packaged as a singular event, but it doesn't actually appear to have been that.
[2:09:35.980 --> 2:09:42.420]  It seems to have been different incidents. In terms of the timeline, I had a look through
[2:09:42.420 --> 2:09:46.460]  the various footage for people who aren't aware who aren't in my telegram group. I shared
[2:09:46.460 --> 2:09:52.180]  footage from the sources from Ukrainian and Russian sources as it emerges onto the telegram
[2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:59.020]  so people can follow in real time. And I had a look at the timeline from whenever it appeared
[2:09:59.020 --> 2:10:04.660]  that the Russian army was starting to withdraw from the northeast of Kiev. So from what I
[2:10:04.660 --> 2:10:10.300]  could gather from looking back on it, it appears most Russian forces, if not all of them had
[2:10:10.300 --> 2:10:16.500]  left around about the 30th of March. There was then some civilian drone footage of Hostelmal
[2:10:16.500 --> 2:10:22.260]  Airport, which is actually north of Bukha. The the airport for people who aren't aware
[2:10:22.260 --> 2:10:27.140]  Hostelmal Airport, that was the base area of Russian offensive operations in the northeast
[2:10:27.140 --> 2:10:32.140]  of Kiev. So this drone footage that emerged that appears to have been taken around about
[2:10:32.140 --> 2:10:39.620]  the 30th potentially the 31st. It showed the airport was completely abandoned. It was probably
[2:10:39.620 --> 2:10:43.740]  not the best turn of phrase, but it was dead for lack of a better term. So the Russians
[2:10:43.740 --> 2:10:50.300]  had vacated the area around that date. Around the first, there was some footage that emerged
[2:10:50.300 --> 2:10:56.620]  30 miles north of some fighting in the town called Ivankov, which appears to have been
[2:10:56.620 --> 2:11:00.660]  the rear echelons of the Russian army leaving. But then there appears to have been a bit
[2:11:00.660 --> 2:11:06.060]  of a lull. It was around about the second of April is whenever the first significant
[2:11:06.060 --> 2:11:11.620]  amounts of footage started to emerge of Ukrainian soldiers in the Bukha and in the Hostelmal
[2:11:11.620 --> 2:11:16.540]  area. And I did a sort of a deep dive through my telegram and through some of the sources
[2:11:16.540 --> 2:11:21.540]  in there was one instance where they reported on civilian casualties, but they didn't make
[2:11:21.540 --> 2:11:27.580]  a strong claim one other way. So given some of the footage that has emerged yesterday,
[2:11:27.580 --> 2:11:33.820]  because yesterday is whenever the these claims, the massacre claims emerged in in large numbers,
[2:11:33.820 --> 2:11:39.900]  it would be strange. And it is puzzling to me that Ukrainian soldiers didn't come across
[2:11:39.900 --> 2:11:47.660]  bodies lying in the street. In some of the footage that they are purporting that that
[2:11:47.660 --> 2:11:53.620]  illustrates or displays that this massacre had occurred. So there appears to be around
[2:11:53.620 --> 2:12:00.140]  about a three four day period between when the Russians had left the area. The area was
[2:12:00.140 --> 2:12:06.060]  and then officially Ukrainian troops had entered. So though in that short space of
[2:12:06.060 --> 2:12:12.220]  days, there was there doesn't appear to have been anyone actually any forces on either
[2:12:12.220 --> 2:12:18.820]  side officially within Hostelmal or in the Bukha area. So there is a possibility that
[2:12:18.820 --> 2:12:26.660]  maybe some some Ukrainian troops, maybe this false flag narrative, maybe that's where that
[2:12:26.660 --> 2:12:34.820]  that could have emerged. Because as I was elucidating a bit earlier on, the Bukha massacre,
[2:12:34.820 --> 2:12:40.940]  quote unquote, is not a singular event. It is separate events. One thing that is puzzling
[2:12:40.940 --> 2:12:45.180]  to me is that some of the dead that have appeared in some of the videos are actually wearing
[2:12:45.180 --> 2:12:50.780]  a white ribbon on their arm, which would be very strange if the Russians had shot these
[2:12:50.780 --> 2:12:55.740]  people because for people who aren't aware, white ribbons on the arms of Russian soldiers,
[2:12:55.740 --> 2:13:01.060]  especially in the northern fronts, that is, that is the identification mark for Russian
[2:13:01.060 --> 2:13:07.140]  troops. So if there are civilians wearing white ribbons, that is curious. Could these
[2:13:07.140 --> 2:13:13.580]  have potentially have been more pro Russian civilians, quote unquote collaborators, who
[2:13:13.580 --> 2:13:17.300]  might have been left behind by the Russian pullout because the Russian pullout appeared
[2:13:17.300 --> 2:13:24.220]  to have been quite chaotic and quite sudden. And then maybe some Ukrainian forces or national
[2:13:24.220 --> 2:13:28.420]  battalion moved into the area, came across these civilians and essentially dealt with
[2:13:28.420 --> 2:13:34.780]  them in the summer. And just there and then that that could be something that needs to
[2:13:34.780 --> 2:13:39.300]  be investigated. But as you were saying earlier on in the show, is all the footage that we
[2:13:39.300 --> 2:13:44.100]  are largely getting is footage that is approved by the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian
[2:13:44.100 --> 2:13:50.500]  army. It is footage that is filmed and edited by Western media, or it is supplied by the
[2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:55.100]  Ukrainian army. And as we both know, they aren't exactly the most unbiased sources.
[2:13:55.100 --> 2:14:00.460]  That is not to say that Russian troops haven't engaged in potentially some criminality or
[2:14:00.460 --> 2:14:07.220]  horrific events. I am minded to believe in some instances, particularly in some of these
[2:14:07.220 --> 2:14:12.420]  apparent executions in basements, that because of the age of the bodies, that those were
[2:14:12.420 --> 2:14:17.900]  more likely to potentially have been some incidents of Russians engaging in that. But
[2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:24.020]  in terms of the most popularly popularized footage of the event, there is a number of
[2:14:24.020 --> 2:14:29.220]  questions that need to be asked. And the big thing to me that sort of raises a lot of
[2:14:29.220 --> 2:14:34.820]  questions is discrepancy and time. What happened in those three or four days between the Russian
[2:14:34.820 --> 2:14:41.460]  pullout and Ukrainian forces officially went in in force? And why are these civilians seemingly
[2:14:41.460 --> 2:14:48.460]  wearing white armbands, which is quite identifiable as an identification mark for the Russian
[2:14:48.460 --> 2:14:52.900]  army and potentially pro-Russian civilians?
[2:14:52.900 --> 2:15:00.140]  Yeah, it's interesting. You mentioned that this could have been a longer drawn out situation
[2:15:00.140 --> 2:15:04.540]  where you have obviously a lot of people killed due to the fighting in that area. We did have
[2:15:04.540 --> 2:15:12.020]  a report about mass graves. So this was March 10. Alex Salvy on Twitter says the first signs
[2:15:12.020 --> 2:15:17.580]  of the excavation were seen on March 10. More recent coverage on March 31 shows the gravesite
[2:15:17.580 --> 2:15:23.160]  with an approximately 45 foot long trench. So if this is true, they had mass graves on
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:28.260]  March 10. So they already had a great volume of dead bodies to have to create mass graves
[2:15:28.260 --> 2:15:33.900]  on March 10. So then presumably there would be enough bodies killed by whichever side
[2:15:33.900 --> 2:15:39.780]  to then lay out on the street and claim that a new Shreberik had occurred, a new massacre
[2:15:39.780 --> 2:15:45.500]  to then blame it on the Russians. It seems entirely possible, given what we've seen regarding
[2:15:45.500 --> 2:15:48.780]  all these other staged incidents in the past. But we're going to come back on the other
[2:15:48.780 --> 2:15:54.940]  side and talk about it more with Michael Duller-Brock. He is on Telegram. Go look him up. We'll
[2:15:54.940 --> 2:15:57.940]  be back on the other side. Summit.org. News, guys.

[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:20.600]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit and
[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:23.160]  they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[2:18:23.160 --> 2:18:27.280]  Everything we've talked about is now coming true and the globalists want to take us off
[2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:28.280]  air.

[2:20:13.880 --> 2:20:21.680]  internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:20:21.680 --> 2:20:30.760]  We're live and we are talking with Michael de la Broque on Telegram, go and follow his
[2:20:30.760 --> 2:20:38.080]  channel following on the source material footage from both sides of the war, Ukraine and Russian
[2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:41.240]  to try and get to the bottom of what is actually happening.
[2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:46.800]  This is not a Daily Mail front page where it's basically just 100% propaganda all the
[2:20:46.800 --> 2:20:47.960]  time.
[2:20:47.960 --> 2:20:50.720]  It's not RT, it's not Sputnik.
[2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:57.120]  It's trying to ascertain the truth as gleaned from sources right there on the ground.
[2:20:57.120 --> 2:21:03.080]  We're talking about the alleged massacre in Bukha, which the war party, the journalists
[2:21:03.080 --> 2:21:06.520]  are lobbying for an old fly zone for American boots on the ground.
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:11.000]  They're comparing it to the Shrebrinitsa massacre of 1995.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:15.320]  And they're asking absolutely zero hard hitting questions about it whatsoever.
[2:21:15.320 --> 2:21:20.000]  There's good being handed footage by Ukrainian government and saying, here it is.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  This happened.
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:22.000]  This is horrific.
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:23.440]  We need war.
[2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:29.120]  But it's interesting, Michael, that the Ukrainian national police posted on Facebook on 2nd
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:35.760]  of April, hours before these videos emerged, quote, today on 2nd of April in the liberated
[2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:40.480]  city of Bukha, special units of the Ukrainian national police began clearing the area of
[2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:44.800]  saboteurs and accomplices of Russian troops.
[2:21:44.800 --> 2:21:48.860]  Were those saboteurs later the dead bodies that ended up on camera?
[2:21:48.860 --> 2:21:54.800]  We also have claims by Russians with attitude on Twitter, which is obviously pro Russian
[2:21:54.800 --> 2:22:00.240]  bias, but they say the as off battalion was in that area.
[2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:03.480]  I know you said to me before it doesn't operate in that area.
[2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:09.600]  But we had an alleged video from an as off battalion member saying the boatsman boys
[2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:10.600]  in Bukha.
[2:22:10.600 --> 2:22:13.600]  And he says at the six second mark, you can clearly hear the dialogue.
[2:22:13.600 --> 2:22:15.280]  There are guys without blue armbands.
[2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:17.440]  Can I shoot them F. Yeah.
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:22.080]  And you mentioned that before where numbers of the victims were wearing white armbands,
[2:22:22.080 --> 2:22:26.520]  which would normally denote that they were either pro Russian saboteurs as the Ukrainians
[2:22:26.520 --> 2:22:29.120]  would call them or Russian troops.
[2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:38.360]  So is there any evidence that as off battalion was involved in this massacre?
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:42.520]  Not that I have seen so far, but that's not to rule out the possibility of it.
[2:22:42.520 --> 2:22:46.880]  Just to clarify, I am aware I've been made aware that there does appear to be a small
[2:22:46.880 --> 2:22:51.680]  unit of as off battalion fighters operating in the Kiev area.
[2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:57.560]  But in general, as off is most of its fighters are deployed in Karkov or they're currently
[2:22:57.560 --> 2:23:00.320]  in the process of being destroyed in Mariupol.
[2:23:00.320 --> 2:23:04.160]  So that was where there was a bit of a contention with myself earlier on.
[2:23:04.160 --> 2:23:09.320]  But there are nationalist battalions, sort of other battalions, National Guard like
[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:14.680]  battalions in the Ukrainian armed forces like as off that have been operating extensively
[2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:17.800]  within the Kiev battle zone.
[2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:23.000]  So the Adair battalion, I'm aware that they potentially more to the east of Kiev, but
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:28.720]  they've also been operating to the northwest in the Bukha, the Irpin battlefront as well
[2:23:28.720 --> 2:23:30.920]  over the past month.
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:39.080]  So the problem is, you cannot really ascertain this stuff unless these people film it at
[2:23:39.080 --> 2:23:46.440]  this stage, until there is a independent forensic investigation of the bodies and of the scene,
[2:23:46.440 --> 2:23:51.480]  unless these people are idiotic enough and in some cases the off battalion in particular
[2:23:51.480 --> 2:23:56.840]  has been rather foolish enough to film themselves engaging in various atrocities and war crimes
[2:23:56.840 --> 2:23:57.840]  on their own.
[2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:01.640]  It is it is hard to properly ascertain who could have committed these offenses.
[2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:07.680]  So if you would indulge me just for a second, just as I go back to something you said just
[2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:13.920]  before the break, you mentioned war crimes, mass graves, and if I could just quickly touch
[2:24:13.920 --> 2:24:18.720]  on that because mass graves is obviously quite an emotive term that's being thrown around
[2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:19.720]  a lot.
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:24.720]  But the one thing to sort of understand, although each of the bodies will have to be examined
[2:24:24.720 --> 2:24:29.240]  that comes out of that grave is that whenever the Russians moved into the area at the start
[2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:35.560]  of the war is it was a very chaotic and very the fighting was very heavy in the area.
[2:24:35.560 --> 2:24:40.880]  So that would assume that there was probably potentially a fair number of civilian casualties
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:45.600]  as well as Ukrainian casualties and Russian casualties themselves.
[2:24:45.600 --> 2:24:49.560]  Obviously the Russians will be more minded to take their dead back home to via Belarus
[2:24:49.560 --> 2:24:50.760]  and to Russia.
[2:24:50.760 --> 2:24:55.440]  But in terms of the local civilians who were killed in this fighting, because of the very
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:25:00.400]  nature of a battlefield, it is not the most hygienic thing to leave bodies just lying
[2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:05.960]  out in the open over weeks and potentially a month because that spreads disease amongst
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:06.960]  local troops.
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:12.880]  So one explanation, I'm not saying it is the explanation, but one hypothesis behind this
[2:25:12.880 --> 2:25:17.800]  mass grave and the date, as you said, it apparently appeared around the 10th of March.
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:22.720]  That's whenever the Russians would have established themselves within the area, very well a lot
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:26.120]  of those bodies could actually have turned out to have been civilians that were killed
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:30.960]  in the fighting within the area, and then the Russians themselves moved them for hygienic
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:33.920]  purposes into that mass grave.
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:40.080]  But just also just to quickly touch it as it appeared on the screen, that unfortunate
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:45.040]  gentleman who's in that sewer grade from my understanding, this is one instance where
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:51.120]  it does actually appear very strongly that the Russians did potentially kill that individual
[2:25:51.120 --> 2:25:55.960]  and his family, because from my understanding from the footage I've seen, that man was
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:26:02.960]  the husband of the mayor of a small village to the east of Hostimal called Mushun, and
[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:10.120]  the female mayor and her family were reported to have essentially been detained by Russian
[2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:17.440]  soldiers earlier in March, and obviously their bodies have now appeared in various places
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:18.440]  across the area.
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:24.160]  So in that case, that is one case where it does appear that it's more likely than not
[2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:30.480]  that maybe the Russians were behind that, but it is obviously it's not conclusive without
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:36.640]  a proper forensic investigation, and the wider scale of the death that's occurred in the
[2:26:36.640 --> 2:26:43.960]  area, I would struggle to make a conclusive decision one way or the other at the moment,
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:50.120]  and I think without, again, an independent forensic investigation, I think it's very
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:56.880]  dangerous for Western press to just assume a certain narrative whenever a lot of the
[2:26:56.880 --> 2:27:00.120]  facts of that narrative are only coming from one side.
[2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:05.240]  Okay, I just want to touch again on Azog Battalion, because we have this headline out
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:09.480]  of CNN, a far right battalion has a key role in Ukraine's resistance, it's neo-Nazi history
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:14.840]  has been exploited by Putin, we see the New York Times removing the neo-Nazi label and
[2:27:14.840 --> 2:27:19.800]  simply calling them far right now, of course Zelensky himself admitted that much of the
[2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:25.760]  Azog Battalion was absorbed into the Ukrainian military, and his comments were cut out by
[2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:26.760]  Fox News.
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:32.120]  Have you seen evidence from your sources that you're following there on the ground of Azog
[2:27:32.120 --> 2:27:36.640]  committing these kind of atrocities that are going unreported by the mainstream media
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:37.800]  in the West?
[2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:44.120]  Yes, extensively, particularly in the Mariupol area.
[2:27:44.120 --> 2:27:50.480]  Whereas in bizarrely kind of a similar fashion, but in reverse of what's happened in Bukha,
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:55.760]  is various Donetsk, the Donetsk People's Republic as their army, and as the Chechens
[2:27:55.760 --> 2:28:02.320]  and the Russians have advanced into Mariupol, there have been a fairly large number of instances
[2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:07.320]  where they have actually come across, for lack of a better term, just essentially brutalised
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:10.040]  and murdered civilians.
[2:28:10.040 --> 2:28:14.120]  There was a case of a woman, the body of an unfortunate woman who appeared to have had
[2:28:14.120 --> 2:28:16.840]  a swastika burned into her chest.
[2:28:16.840 --> 2:28:23.080]  Her body was found by Russian soldiers in an Isolv sort of forward operating base that
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:27.120]  was in the bottom of, in the cellar of a school or supermarket.
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:33.000]  There is also cases of civilians that had their hands and their legs binded by cord,
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:36.120]  and they'd been essentially summarily executed.
[2:28:36.120 --> 2:28:41.000]  I don't know if you're looking to get into this in maybe another segment, but the Isolv
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:46.080]  appears to have been involved in some quite visceral and horrific footage of the torture
[2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:50.440]  and potential murder of Russian prisoners in the Karkov area as well.
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:52.520]  We'll get into that on the other side, Michael.
[2:28:52.520 --> 2:28:53.520]  Stay right there.
[2:28:53.520 --> 2:28:54.520]  One more segment.
[2:28:54.520 --> 2:28:55.520]  So, don't use, don't go away.
[2:28:55.520 --> 2:28:56.520]  We'll do that.
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:29:05.240]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series at 1776coin.com
[2:29:05.240 --> 2:29:09.520]  and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:12.880]  Thomas Jefferson, quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[2:29:12.880 --> 2:29:13.880]  It's a coin I designed.
[2:29:13.880 --> 2:29:18.080]  I'm very, very proud of it, and it will end up being a collectible.
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:23.200]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[2:29:23.200 --> 2:29:24.480]  we sold it.
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:30.160]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly, and I appreciate listeners getting
[2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:31.160]  over half of them now.
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:33.280]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[2:29:33.280 --> 2:29:36.960]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:41.600]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:43.680]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people, and that's a big problem.
[2:29:43.680 --> 2:29:47.640]  So, as a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom,
[2:29:47.640 --> 2:29:51.840]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems, so please give yourself

[2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:06.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarsDoor.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history,
[2:31:06.880 --> 2:31:11.800]  and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[2:31:11.800 --> 2:31:17.760]  are broken down, and InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[2:31:17.760 --> 2:31:22.640]  operations, and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making
[2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:23.640]  their main move.
[2:31:23.640 --> 2:31:27.920]  InfoWars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[2:31:27.920 --> 2:31:32.520]  ever despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing and having to run our own
[2:31:32.520 --> 2:31:36.840]  infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of
[2:31:36.840 --> 2:31:37.840]  money soliciting.
[2:31:37.840 --> 2:31:44.440]  Up to 75% off at InfoWarsDoor.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread
[2:31:44.440 --> 2:31:51.400]  the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25% to 75%
[2:31:51.400 --> 2:31:58.400]  off right now, the biggest selling in our history, at InfoWarsDoor.com, thank you for
[2:31:58.400 --> 2:31:59.400]  your support.
[2:31:59.400 --> 2:32:04.160]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon, I've been training probably not as much as
[2:32:04.160 --> 2:32:08.360]  they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for InfoWarsDoor.com.
[2:32:08.360 --> 2:32:14.640]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to
[2:32:14.640 --> 2:32:19.800]  get going, you know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need
[2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:24.640]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[2:32:24.640 --> 2:32:28.800]  for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:34.760]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis, I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[2:32:34.760 --> 2:32:39.440]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[2:32:39.440 --> 2:32:41.800]  support and extra flexibility.
[2:32:41.800 --> 2:32:46.400]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:51.080]  And if you're not crazy enough to take out a marathon, good news, turbo force, that can
[2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:55.160]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorilis can keep you
[2:32:55.160 --> 2:32:58.480]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[2:32:58.480 --> 2:33:23.600]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:23.600 --> 2:33:30.600]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit Dot News.
[2:33:30.600 --> 2:33:37.920]  We're live, we're talking to Michael de la Brot of the Bohanka Telegram channel.
[2:33:37.920 --> 2:33:44.400]  Go and subscribe to that Telegram channel right now for live breaking footage and analysis
[2:33:44.400 --> 2:33:50.720]  from on the ground sources, both pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian on the ground there in Ukraine.
[2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:56.320]  We were talking before the break about atrocities, the as-off battalion, claims of people being
[2:33:56.320 --> 2:33:59.600]  taped to trees, Russian saboteurs.
[2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:03.040]  And you were just getting into it there, Michael, a couple of weeks ago, and I believe
[2:34:03.040 --> 2:34:08.560]  it was, we had these, and in fact last weekend it was, we had these horrific videos of what
[2:34:08.560 --> 2:34:15.000]  appeared to be Russian prisoners of war being unloaded from wagons by Ukrainians, shot in
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:19.120]  the leg, shot in the knee, abused, left to die in agony.
[2:34:19.120 --> 2:34:25.520]  We also had the footage which was posted to Twitter of Ukrainian soldiers filming themselves
[2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:31.200]  calling up the mothers of dead Russian soldiers and mocking them, that was very nice.
[2:34:31.200 --> 2:34:35.400]  Were these culprits that apparently carried out this war crime atrocity against these
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:37.520]  prisoners of war ever captured?
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:43.080]  I know there was a claim that they were captured by Russian special forces, but then that subsequently
[2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:45.760]  turned out apparently to not be true.
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:50.280]  What happened during that incident, which barely got any mainstream media attention,
[2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:54.360]  and is there any update as to whether the perpetrators have been caught?
[2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:59.880]  Yeah, so just in preparation for this, I actually had to look back and try to find some footage
[2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:05.120]  of some of the incidents and they appear to have been completely scrubbed from telegram
[2:35:05.120 --> 2:35:09.040]  as far as I can tell, which is interesting to know.
[2:35:09.040 --> 2:35:13.920]  But for people who haven't seen it, and if you are minded to go and look it out by after
[2:35:13.920 --> 2:35:21.760]  caution you, it is very graphic footage, but in the hours before the actual video itself
[2:35:21.760 --> 2:35:27.840]  dropped, there was footage of essentially Russian soldiers had been stripped effectively
[2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:34.720]  naked or down to their boxers or underwear, as they had surrendered to some of the patches
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:39.160]  that you could definitely see in some of this footage were Azov fighters, and this was in
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:40.720]  the Karkov area.
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:49.200]  So at this time as well, this was a week ago, you are talking round about freezing temperature.
[2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:55.720]  That was disturbing in and of itself, and then a day later quite visceral footage emerged
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:36:04.720]  of Russian prisoners of war lying down on the ground in rows, obviously bleeding from
[2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:12.160]  their knees or from their arms, and then the footage pans to a recently arrived van, and
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:17.560]  the troops are identifiably Ukrainian, they are wearing Ukrainian marks, they identify
[2:36:17.560 --> 2:36:24.840]  themselves as Ukrainian, they look Ukrainian, the prisoners look Russian, and as free Russian
[2:36:24.840 --> 2:36:31.600]  prisoners get out of this van, essentially Ukrainian soldier comes up to them, basically
[2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:37.600]  shoots the arm off of one of the Russian prisoners, and then blows the kneecap off
[2:36:37.600 --> 2:36:42.760]  of the other two, and then that was followed up with another short clip shortly after it,
[2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:49.520]  where the Russian soldier who had his arm effectively amputated, there was a Ukrainian
[2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:54.320]  effectively standing over him, filming him on his phone, and there was no evidence at
[2:36:54.320 --> 2:36:59.320]  all in any of the footage that any medical provision was provided to any of these soldiers,
[2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:04.040]  so I don't think I need to say that there are major arteries in the legs and in the
[2:37:04.040 --> 2:37:08.760]  arms, and if these soldiers weren't, if a tourniquet wasn't applied, or proper medical
[2:37:08.760 --> 2:37:14.160]  provision was given to these prisoners, it is very likely that many of them probably
[2:37:14.160 --> 2:37:19.080]  perished as a result of it, and then added on top of this, perhaps the most graphic footage
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:27.600]  that I've seen, is there was an alleged Russian prisoner, the footage was within a stairwell,
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:32.840]  where a Ukrainian soldier, or Ukrainian territorial defence, because there is a difference between
[2:37:32.840 --> 2:37:38.320]  the Ukrainian army that is of battalion and territorial defence, but I think this particular
[2:37:38.320 --> 2:37:44.840]  individual was territorial defence, the Russian soldier appears to have had one of his fingers
[2:37:44.840 --> 2:37:52.880]  physically cut off, and then the footage does show it, and the screaming is quite horrific,
[2:37:52.880 --> 2:38:00.200]  this Ukrainian soldier then proceeds to murder this Russian prisoner by thrusting a knife
[2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:06.200]  into his eye, and then that particular Russian soldier, there was then footage emerged later
[2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:11.000]  where effectively his body had been burned, but you could still identify from the facial
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:18.320]  features who it was, so just to quickly address your comments about if these people were actually
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:23.920]  apprehended, I believe the Russians, some Russian sources did claim that they did apprehend
[2:38:23.920 --> 2:38:31.640]  them, but it did turn out in hindsight that they did not, some of the alleged perpetrators
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:36.040]  who engaged in these acts actually ended up live streaming themselves and mocking the
[2:38:36.040 --> 2:38:42.360]  Russians from a live stream in the Karkov area, but as you touched on instances where
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:48.800]  Ukrainians have actually physically called the families back in Russia to mock Russian
[2:38:48.800 --> 2:38:52.680]  dead, I will not go too far into that because actually it gets very dark some of the footage
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:58.400]  I have seen and some of the instances of it, but some of the Ukrainian soldiers again largely
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:03.640]  as off battalion from the examples that I have seen, they themselves have actually fallen
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:11.400]  into Russian captivity, and the Russians knew and know who these people are, if you don't
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:17.840]  want to be doxxed, essentially do not anger Russian Telegram users because they seem to
[2:39:17.840 --> 2:39:24.320]  be absolute experts of being able to identify and geolocate people, and they have made their
[2:39:24.320 --> 2:39:29.240]  personal mission to identify the Ukrainians who are engaged in this, and like I say some
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:34.960]  of these people have since fallen into Russian captivity, and the Russians haven't executed
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:41.520]  them, and it does look like some of them might have been slapped around the face, but the
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:46.880]  Russians did make a note in the captions that I have seen to film them and say we know who
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:52.200]  you are and you will essentially be put on trial for what you have engaged in, and obviously
[2:39:52.200 --> 2:39:57.800]  we will have to see what comes of that for the public and legal record.
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:04.640]  Yeah, and I mean the point is, you know, people will say oh they are just Russian invaders,
[2:40:04.640 --> 2:40:08.880]  they deserve everything they get, well now we have like Geneva Convention for a reason,
[2:40:08.880 --> 2:40:13.920]  we have war crimes denunciations for a reason, even Zelensky himself came out I think a couple
[2:40:13.920 --> 2:40:18.600]  of days after that video emerged and said please don't commit war crimes by the way,
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:23.400]  so if the Russians were doing that to Ukrainians, if they just unload them from trucks, shoot
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:28.160]  their arms off, shoot them in the knee, watch them bleed to death in agony, that would be
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:33.520]  a global outrage, that would be an atrocity, that would be a Putin sponsored war crime,
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:40.080]  it would be sustained wall to wall media coverage 24 seven, this one I didn't see any, maybe
[2:40:40.080 --> 2:40:44.600]  they came out after but at the time I didn't see any mainstream media coverage of it whatsoever,
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:49.600]  I didn't see the fact checkers trying to get involved, I didn't see anything, but we got
[2:40:49.600 --> 2:40:54.760]  a couple of minutes left, I just want to get into the overall wider perspective, of course
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:41:00.040]  we were told in the west oh Russia expected to mop up all these major cities in days,
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:04.400]  they expected it to be over in a couple of weeks, I never really believed that at the
[2:41:04.400 --> 2:41:09.440]  time but did Russia really expect it to be a kind of blitzkrieg or were they always you
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:15.560]  know prepared to dig in for a protracted war?
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:19.480]  And what I've seen from the way the Russians conducted themselves, the way they initiated
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:28.200]  the advance, the way they employed conscripts in the start, I in the way the VDV, the Russian
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:35.760]  paratroopers conducted and landed on hostile airfield, I again I'm not in the Kremlin,
[2:41:35.760 --> 2:41:40.280]  I'm not in Russian command bunkers, so I don't know what they themselves are saying,
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:47.720]  I am minded to believe that the Russians did think if they could take Kiev via hostile
[2:41:47.720 --> 2:41:53.560]  and via Chernobyl from Belarus in the space of maybe about four or five days, that could
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:58.800]  have potentially caused crippled the Ukrainian army, crippled the Ukrainian state, caused
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:04.240]  so much confusion, over the next two or three weeks as the Russian army advances across
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:11.080]  Ukraine it would deal piecemeal with scattered and confused Ukrainian resistance, that is
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:16.240]  kind of where I personally am in thinking about the start of the invasion, but obviously
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:22.280]  the war hasn't developed in that scale so I think it's probably more a failure of Russian
[2:42:22.280 --> 2:42:27.040]  initial intelligence, battlefield intelligence at the start of the war, but as we can see
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:31.560]  with the pull-out from the north of Kiev, from Chernigov and assuming the area and redeploying
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:36.680]  to the Donbas, the Russians are very much in the mindset that this will be a protracted
[2:42:36.680 --> 2:42:40.040]  and prolonged war and they're setting up for that.
[2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:44.400]  Okay, Michael, I'll tell you what, I just got one more question then I want you to plug
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:48.440]  your telegram channel, so we'll come back on the other side and do three or four more
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:53.160]  minutes with Michael Dilla Brock of The Hanukkah Watch and then I'll get into some COVID news
[2:42:53.160 --> 2:42:56.560]  on the other side, summit.news, don't go away.
[2:42:56.560 --> 2:43:05.400]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series at 1776coin.com
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:09.720]  or info.restore.com and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[2:43:09.720 --> 2:43:13.120]  Thomas Jefferson, quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:18.200]  It's a coin I designed, I'm very, very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible.
[2:43:18.200 --> 2:43:23.320]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:24.640]  we sold it.
[2:43:24.640 --> 2:43:30.320]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:31.320]  over half of them now.
[2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:35.240]  I'd like to move them out very quickly, I think they will sell out probably in five
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:41.200]  or six more days and without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same
[2:43:41.200 --> 2:43:42.200]  capacity.
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:43.840]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem.
[2:43:43.840 --> 2:43:48.000]  So it was a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:50.920]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[2:43:50.920 --> 2:43:56.920]  So please, give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776coin.com.
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:44:02.120]  Get our great bag of it here.
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:06.840]  I mean this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[2:44:06.840 --> 2:44:11.560]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:15.320]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah, we buy it from the little
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:19.280]  farmers that, you know, the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:22.840]  the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:23.840]  Mexican government take over.
[2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:27.280]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:28.480]  and the price has never gone up.
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:33.200]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[2:44:33.200 --> 2:44:35.360]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[2:44:35.360 --> 2:44:38.560]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[2:44:38.560 --> 2:44:46.360]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, we have like that, I think you wouldn't
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:47.360]  believe it.
[2:44:47.360 --> 2:44:51.840]  So it's InfowarsStore.com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:57.760]  fund us or don't want to see it, that's fine.
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:02.280]  Introducing the newest product from InfowarsLife.com.
[2:45:02.280 --> 2:45:05.800]  We are so proud of InfowarsLife immune support.
[2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:13.520]  It is concentrated herbs that are known on record to supercharge our body's natural defenses.
[2:45:13.520 --> 2:45:17.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get and on
[2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:21.520]  top of it, it funds the Infowar so that's a 360 win.
[2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:24.560]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[2:45:24.560 --> 2:45:30.560]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root,
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:33.000]  loatium root and more.
[2:45:33.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  This product is incredible.
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:40.320]  Infowars immune support exclusively available at InfowarsStore.com is funding the tip of
[2:45:40.320 --> 2:45:42.640]  the spear, the Infowars operation.
[2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:44.040]  It is a 360 win.
[2:45:44.040 --> 2:45:48.480]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[2:45:48.480 --> 2:45:51.120]  natural defenses and keep Infowars on the air.
[2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:53.560]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:58.160]  Take action now, InfowarsStore.com.
[2:45:58.160 --> 2:46:00.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[2:46:00.040 --> 2:46:03.480]  I need your help keeping Infowars on the air and strong.
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:07.480]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[2:46:07.480 --> 2:46:12.000]  I was born for this, you were born for this and people are really waking up right now
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:17.080]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming
[2:46:17.080 --> 2:46:18.840]  that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:23.520]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[2:46:23.520 --> 2:46:29.440]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:30.440]  of charge.
[2:46:30.440 --> 2:46:35.240]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:39.720]  Infowars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[2:46:39.720 --> 2:46:46.040]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:50.000]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, so the biggest sale in Infowars history is
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:55.320]  going right now, the mega-emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off, getting credible products
[2:46:55.320 --> 2:46:58.600]  and keep Infowars as strong as ever.
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:10.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:10.040 --> 2:47:15.360]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:24.360]  You're live and I'm not going to get a chance to go fall into this COVID news, but basically
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:29.880]  China has pursued an utterly disastrous zero COVID policy.
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:33.600]  They've got zero herd immunity in their entire population.
[2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:39.000]  They've had more COVID cases in Shanghai over the past two weeks or four weeks than the entire
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:42.960]  previous two years of the whole pandemic.
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:49.400]  Now they've sent the Army into Shanghai to separate parents from their children in quarantine
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:50.400]  facilities.
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:57.480]  They're having to COVID test 26 million people in Shanghai, again, because they went for zero
[2:47:57.480 --> 2:48:02.920]  COVID and not herd immunity, which is why they're getting all these cases in comparison
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:05.720]  to relatively few in the previous two years.
[2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:12.520]  An utter warning from China as to how to not deal with a pandemic and they're going to
[2:48:12.520 --> 2:48:16.840]  continue paying the price for many months or even years to come.
[2:48:16.840 --> 2:48:22.040]  We also have mask wearing has left a generation of toddlers struggling with speech and social
[2:48:22.040 --> 2:48:23.040]  skills.
[2:48:23.040 --> 2:48:28.240]  I talked about the speech therapists in America seeing, quote, a 364% increase in patient
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:32.280]  referrals of babies and toddlers who basically can't talk.
[2:48:32.280 --> 2:48:37.440]  They're not learning speech skills, social skills, and now this report finds that because
[2:48:37.440 --> 2:48:43.400]  adults have been wearing face masks on and off for the past two years, children are being
[2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:46.920]  having struggles identifying speech patterns.
[2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:49.880]  Their cognitive development has been completely stunted.
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:52.920]  They can't put their own coats on according to this report.
[2:48:52.920 --> 2:48:57.960]  In some cases toddlers are struggling with crawling using the toilet independently and
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:48:59.520]  making friends.
[2:48:59.520 --> 2:49:03.520]  All these symptoms are increasing and the speech struggles are increasing.
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:07.680]  They can't learn to talk partly because of lockdown restrictions which prevented them
[2:49:07.680 --> 2:49:13.360]  socializing with other kids and partly because adults have been virtue signaling with their
[2:49:13.360 --> 2:49:19.360]  face nappies for the past two years and it's stunted the cognitive development of children.
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:22.360]  But keep professing how you're the good people on Twitter.
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:27.320]  I'm sure you can continue to do so while living in complete arrogance or ignorance of the
[2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:34.120]  complete fact that you are responsible for these kids having all these problems which
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:36.200]  are only set to get worse.
[2:49:36.200 --> 2:49:41.480]  Also the people who lobbied for school lockdowns are solar responsible for this and yet they
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:46.800]  continue to put the mask emoticon in their little Twitter bio alongside the Ukrainian
[2:49:46.800 --> 2:49:50.840]  flag and claim that they're the good guys and they were on the right side of history.
[2:49:50.840 --> 2:49:53.920]  Now you weren't, you were on the wrong side of history.
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:55.320]  Now I'm talking to Michael Delobrott.
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:49:58.600]  We got a few minutes left Michael before I hand back to Owen.
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:03.400]  I want you to plug your telegram channel at the end but final question just in the last
[2:50:03.400 --> 2:50:05.160]  few minutes here.
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:07.520]  What do you see at the most likely outcome of the war?
[2:50:07.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  Of course we've got negotiations ongoing virtually every day at this point don't seem to come
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:13.520]  to any conclusion.
[2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:18.880]  Do you see some kind of halfway house peace deal or do you see Russia eventually being
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:23.160]  forced to retreat entirely with their tails between their legs?
[2:50:23.160 --> 2:50:27.080]  Where do you see it going and then finally tell people how they can find you on telegram?
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:28.520]  Yeah, no problem.
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:36.760]  So just it's hard to predict the future but in general I expected this war in some form
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:43.720]  or another will result in a Russian military victory of sorts and that will then force
[2:50:43.720 --> 2:50:52.320]  Zelensky and the Ukrainian government to exceed to most if not all of the major Russian demands.
[2:50:52.320 --> 2:50:56.520]  I just off the bat and it's more of a guesstimate but I'm expecting we're probably looking at
[2:50:56.520 --> 2:50:59.160]  a six to nine month war.
[2:50:59.160 --> 2:51:03.360]  It's currently mud season in Ukraine that's going to slow down any offensive operations
[2:51:03.360 --> 2:51:05.280]  by the Russians.
[2:51:05.280 --> 2:51:08.040]  The Russians have pulled out of the Kiev and insuring the Gulf area.
[2:51:08.040 --> 2:51:12.920]  I think this is part of a wider strategy to focus on the Donbass to advance up from the
[2:51:12.920 --> 2:51:19.360]  south of Karkov and hollow out Ukraine to the east of the Napa and it's below the Ukrainian
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:24.000]  army has done very well and equipped itself very well against the Russians so far.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:27.360]  The terrain that the Russians are currently going to be launching their main offensive
[2:51:27.360 --> 2:51:32.480]  through is kind of the terrain that the Russians do the best at.
[2:51:32.480 --> 2:51:40.120]  So unless something drastically changes I do think we will probably eventually see a
[2:51:40.120 --> 2:51:46.920]  Russian victory of sorts and the longer it goes on for in the Russians field they have
[2:51:46.920 --> 2:51:51.920]  had to pay more in blood and toil to achieve that victory.
[2:51:51.920 --> 2:51:57.760]  I expect potentially the Russian demands of Ukraine might increase so obviously we don't
[2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:03.320]  have the time to really go in depth here but the Russians do appear to have long term ambitions
[2:52:03.320 --> 2:52:10.560]  in Kherson and Zaporizhia in the south of Ukraine and potentially also Odessa as well.
[2:52:10.560 --> 2:52:15.320]  So if the Russians feel that they've paid a large enough price I wouldn't be surprised
[2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:22.520]  if they feel that those parts of Ukraine those Ukrainian oblasts might need to become quasi
[2:52:22.520 --> 2:52:28.280]  independent republics like Lugansk and the Donetsk area.
[2:52:28.280 --> 2:52:33.240]  Okay and just finally tell people how they can find your channel on Telegram.
[2:52:33.240 --> 2:52:38.720]  Yeah no problem so if people in fact if you just google my name it might just come up but
[2:52:38.720 --> 2:52:44.760]  if you go on to Telegram if you look up Michael Der Labrock that yeah it's kind of a French
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:52.320]  name D-E-L-A-B-R-O-C it should be one of the top results if not the only result the
[2:52:52.320 --> 2:52:53.320]  comes up there.
[2:52:53.320 --> 2:52:57.960]  So it's Michael Der Labrock behind the watch if people are interested essentially what
[2:52:57.960 --> 2:53:04.000]  I do is I look through various Russian and Ukrainian sources on Telegram because obviously
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:08.400]  Telegram is very popular in both countries.
[2:53:08.400 --> 2:53:12.720]  Look at the footage that comes out the various reports that come out I try to make an assessment
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:19.160]  of it post it for people to look at themselves so you don't just have to follow me I direct
[2:53:19.160 --> 2:53:25.000]  you to the exact Russian and Ukrainian source that the footage comes from and every now
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:29.320]  and again I'll try and give a bit of context and how it fits into the wider picture of
[2:53:29.320 --> 2:53:36.880]  what's actually happening in Ukraine with who with what when where and how.
[2:53:36.880 --> 2:53:40.880]  Okay it's a great resource Michael of course as you know I follow it we'll definitely have
[2:53:40.880 --> 2:53:45.240]  you back on the show we're going to leave it there with Michael because Owen is now
[2:53:45.240 --> 2:53:50.760]  set to take over the rest of the show that's it for my segment here is back in the studio
[2:53:50.760 --> 2:53:53.440]  Owen Shroyer Owen take it away.
[2:53:53.440 --> 2:53:58.320]  Thank you Paul and I didn't coordinate with Paul but what he was talking about early on
[2:53:58.320 --> 2:54:03.400]  in this segment goes along with what I wanted to leave my portion of the transmission with
[2:54:03.400 --> 2:54:10.200]  today and we'll pick it back up tomorrow and that's discussing the torment and the torture
[2:54:10.200 --> 2:54:15.240]  that the children have had to go through in the last couple years dealing with the covid
[2:54:15.240 --> 2:54:21.600]  nonsense and protocols and this story was in the New Yorker today headline the mystifying
[2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:29.440]  rise of child suicide the mystifying rise of child suicide well it's really not a mystery
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:36.520]  actually no sadly it's not a mystery at all and if you do a psychological evaluation of
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:46.960]  suicide or suicide victims will say what is the cause what is what drives people to suicide
[2:54:46.960 --> 2:54:52.000]  and it's a very common thread sometimes it may have to do with family issue or a financial
[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:56.320]  issue or personal issue but every time it's a future it's a thing of the future where
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:55:00.360]  they feel there is no future the future is bleak for whatever reason so they just decide
[2:55:00.360 --> 2:55:04.320]  I don't want to go into the future I'm going to kill myself now so that brings us back
[2:55:04.320 --> 2:55:11.600]  the mystifying rise of child suicide folks it's not a mystery sadly children are seeing
[2:55:11.600 --> 2:55:19.520]  that the future is bleak and it's not a mystery where this is coming from and it's the cultural
[2:55:19.520 --> 2:55:24.200]  left it's the political left that's not up for debate and and you can look at the numbers
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:28.200]  of suicide rates amongst transgender individuals and say oh look they're pushing them to beat
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:33.640]  transgender they're pushing them to suicide oh look how the left is destroying America's
[2:55:33.640 --> 2:55:38.040]  culture destroying America's economy just just destroying the future for us so people
[2:55:38.040 --> 2:55:41.800]  are killing themselves they see all the nonsense they see all the madness and they think huh
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:46.400]  there's no future here I'm just going to kill myself very sad state of affairs but let's
[2:55:46.400 --> 2:55:54.520]  be clear there is no mystery I'm not doing this isn't a partisan politics diatribe here
[2:55:54.520 --> 2:56:02.280]  it's just the fact the left is destroying the future culturally and politically and
[2:56:02.280 --> 2:56:08.200]  it's causing a rise of suicide and when you look at it in children who is it that is currently
[2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:12.840]  targeting the children for destruction with their sexual agenda and their covert agenda
[2:56:12.840 --> 2:56:18.720]  it's the left so it's not a mystifying rise of suicide we know exactly what's causing

[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:56.880]  what's going on if you come out anything that is against the narrative of the warhawks
[3:00:56.880 --> 3:01:03.880]  and the hate rusher campaign book you're censored and again to make this 100% totally
[3:01:03.880 --> 3:01:13.680]  clear I am totally opposed to the Russian invasion of Ukraine I perfectly understand
[3:01:13.680 --> 3:01:20.440]  why it happened again we write the magazine the trends journal you go back to our 2014
[3:01:20.440 --> 3:01:27.200]  issues and we're writing all about the American overthrow of the democratically elected government
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:39.800]  of viktor Yanukovych in 2014 and how little hunter biden got all that dough yeah sniffing
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:45.800]  and sucking his way in there to work for barisma energy along with the other arrogant
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:56.400]  boy his daddy in law or stepdaddy in law stepdaddy john carry yeah stepson christopher hines
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:02:01.840]  all working for barisma energy so I know all the background I know about the donbas region
[3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:08.120]  and how over 15,000 people were killed there right about in detail how the deal made between
[3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:14.440]  Gorbachev and bush senior beginning with Reagan before that that NATO wouldn't move
[3:02:14.440 --> 3:02:22.880]  one inch further and it was 16 NATO countries and a slimy low life piece of criminal crap
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:32.520]  murderous low life scum bill clinton did away with it and from 16 NATO countries and then
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:43.520]  throw bush and obama expanded to 30 so I know about all that but the hypocrisy in the media
[3:02:43.520 --> 3:02:49.120]  every day every day now what went on in that place where the Russians said they didn't
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:57.480]  do it in the in the ukraines are blaming the russian about killing 443 people you're not
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:07.960]  even close you're not even close to bush's war against the rock was only about what 820,000
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:15.280]  you've got a long way to go you russians oh and fat mouth biden big mouth biden draft

[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:26.280]  be proper penis change so I won't say Dick Cheney oh by the way about the language stuff
[3:08:26.280 --> 3:08:37.320]  you know I looked up who the top songs were in in in the Grammys my kind of tune all the
[3:08:37.320 --> 3:08:44.840]  language coming from these women using the F word and the other word for crap that begins
[3:08:44.840 --> 3:08:52.120]  with an S oh yeah write in the lyrics oh they could say them but hey Salento you a vulgar

[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:31.680]  us the Iraq war and my friend Phil Geraldi former top CIA guy quit the CIA because he
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:38.280]  knew that the lies were coming in during that time before the war started he quit a top
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:48.440]  position wonderful man and a lot of other guys they knew it they were lives so if you're

[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:09.960]  lead the charge I believe in a man named George Washington that these little boys couldn't
[3:10:09.960 --> 3:10:17.840]  bow down to in his farewell address saying no foreign entanglements we are losing it
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:27.760]  we're losing it big yeah mankind was put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind
[3:10:27.760 --> 3:10:38.440]  JFK that's right as I said what Putin should have done is what Khrushchev did America put
[3:10:38.440 --> 3:10:46.920]  missiles in Turkey aiming at Russia hey I'm gonna put missiles in Cuba aiming at the
[3:10:46.920 --> 3:10:54.200]  United States alright alright we'll take him out of Cuba Turkey you take him out of Cuba
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:11:03.680]  okay you got a deal is everybody happy that's all he had to do put missiles in Cuba because
[3:11:03.680 --> 3:11:08.360]  that's all America now the words come out is a report that was reportedly in the Wall
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:15.800]  Street Journal that the president or the chancellor I love these words Chancellor

[3:11:40.520 --> 3:11:45.880]  the comedian who became president of played president played a comedian who played the
[3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:56.120]  comedian on TV that became the president Ukraine Zelensky would not agree to any of Russia's
[3:11:56.120 --> 3:12:03.200]  demands which were very simple the Donbass region would be a separatist region wouldn't
[3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:09.080]  break away but separatist here is it the Grammys isn't that great yeah I mean isn't talking

[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:33.680]  of the things that Russia wanted not to join NATO demilitarize and again people talk about
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:41.160]  well Russia being in Crimea all right have a place called Guantanamo naval base in Cuba
[3:12:41.160 --> 3:12:46.920]  it's okay for Americans to be there oh yeah we're only torturing people there illegally
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:52.880]  you know just tortures and torture wonderful so it's okay for America to be in Guantanamo
[3:12:52.880 --> 3:13:00.000]  but it's not okay for Russia to be in Crimea which they've only been there since I think
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:06.760]  about 1735 with Catherine the Great took the joint over so maybe the Mexicans should they

[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:05.880]  then what's the name over there that just passed on Madeleine not all that bright yeah
[3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:10.080]  when I come back I'm gonna tell you a story about when I was whipped I did a gig with
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:20.400]  her quoted on 60 minutes Leslie Stahl that the price of 500,000 dead Iraqi children because
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:33.880]  of Bill Clinton's murderous bombings and mandates she said when Leslie Stahl asked her is the
[3:15:33.880 --> 3:15:40.880]  price of 500,000 Iraqi children dead under the age of five because of the sanctions that
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:47.760]  Bill Clinton put on the country and the war efforts worth it she said yes it is may you
[3:15:47.760 --> 3:15:57.680]  rotten hell fatcha brute where you belong we'll be right back so when I first started
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:02.840]  taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds I was overweight I had brain fog like
[3:16:02.840 --> 3:16:07.200]  you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on your
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:10.960]  show and I listened to it so the first one I got was the original survival shield the
[3:16:10.960 --> 3:16:15.520]  X1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with F2 you had you
[3:16:15.520 --> 3:16:18.560]  know with a deep version source you know and I got really excited about that so I took
[3:16:18.560 --> 3:16:25.240]  it and man in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened
[3:16:25.240 --> 3:16:30.120]  you know I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the
[3:16:30.120 --> 3:16:34.320]  next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your
[3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:38.320]  supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one I like recently
[3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:42.560]  is knockout it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:46.680]  but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the
[3:16:46.680 --> 3:16:51.320]  globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[3:16:51.320 --> 3:16:54.520]  beautifully said brother I thank you so much for calling Godspeed
[3:16:54.520 --> 3:17:01.240]  Ladies and gentlemen I need your help I need your help keeping info wars on the air and
[3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:07.320]  strong I need your help making sure that our mission continues on I was born for this you

[3:22:08.200 --> 3:22:14.040]  so this is from the financial times so it's not like a conspiracy theorist although it comes from
[3:22:14.040 --> 3:22:20.200]  the imf the uh is it the international monetary fund mafia federy i keep getting them mixed up
[3:22:20.200 --> 3:22:30.760]  because they're banksters you know the us led western sanctions campaign against russia threaten
[3:22:30.760 --> 3:22:38.520]  to chip away at the us dollars dominance as the world's reserve currency a top imf official told

[3:22:46.280 --> 3:22:52.200]  we've been saying this is going to go on so all i'm saying is that you might want to consider
[3:22:54.840 --> 3:23:04.760]  having enough food and whatever you need to protect yourself and money in your hands and not in the
[3:23:04.760 --> 3:23:13.160]  bank because this thing could change like that look what happened with the kovat war
[3:23:13.800 --> 3:23:20.520]  who would have ever thought we lose our freedoms the way we did you can't make this crap up

[3:25:05.400 --> 3:25:13.560]  rent for rent for rent for rent for rent for rent the stupid moronic ignorant sanctions put on by
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:20.440]  an arrogant guy that's been sucking off the public to his whole life never worked a day in it no his
[3:25:20.440 --> 3:25:27.000]  name is joe biden only been doing it since he's 30 years old and we know what his boy who's done all
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:33.880]  those got those great gigs because the daddy these guys don't work politicians don't work
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:42.840]  they don't care they just get your money so what are they gonna do
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:53.800]  yeah biden moronic biden puts these sanctions on russia barley prices weed prices yeah
[3:25:55.880 --> 3:26:04.760]  one after another palladium oh oils back up i just do only about 107 dollars a barrel now
[3:26:04.760 --> 3:26:14.200]  well gold went up today wonder why these sanctions the imf is telling you what it's
[3:26:14.200 --> 3:26:18.120]  going to do to the dollar it's right in front of your eyes when they're coming out with it
[3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:28.760]  it's not a conspiracy theory again you don't have to believe me even though we've been right
[3:26:28.760 --> 3:26:38.280]  right most of the time jp morgan ceo jamie diamond who made 30 million dollars plus last year
[3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:46.760]  says big risks loom for the u.s economy that's from cnbc today
[3:26:51.800 --> 3:26:57.720]  the head of the nation's biggest bank or for the largely upbeat view of the economy's health
[3:26:57.720 --> 3:27:04.200]  in his annual letter above our monday but he went on to say that mr diamond warned that the war in
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:11.960]  ukraine could collide with rising inflation to slow the recovery and alter global alliances
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:20.440]  for decades to come no kidding blow me away never would have known it if he didn't say it
[3:27:20.440 --> 3:27:30.280]  it inflation was bad before the ukraine war it's made a bad situation worse and clown biden
[3:27:30.280 --> 3:27:37.320]  even admitted that the sanctions don't work again did they work against cuba they work against
[3:27:37.320 --> 3:27:41.960]  venezuela they work against the ron now only hurts the people and they're hurting us
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:49.880]  this is not going to be inflation or stagflation rather where you have a stagnant economy
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:52.760]  and rising inflation
[3:27:55.320 --> 3:28:01.560]  it's going to be drag flation the economy is going to be dragged down and inflation is going up
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:09.560]  but i'd better be careful saying about drag flation because uh info wars had a story up
[3:28:09.560 --> 3:28:15.880]  there about the transgender assistant secretary of health rachel event so i got to be crowded
[3:28:15.880 --> 3:28:22.040]  careful about drag flation a four star admiral and they got that wrong i think a rear admiral is
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:27.880]  more appropriate you imagine his clown dressed up like this calling himself the health minister
[3:28:27.880 --> 3:28:34.680]  the guy got more chins than china town and telling me about health that's how low it's gone
[3:28:34.680 --> 3:28:43.160]  you better prepare and info wars has a lot of the products that you need there it is

[3:33:29.560 --> 3:33:36.520]  you know current events form future trends tracking trends is the understanding of where we are
[3:33:37.160 --> 3:33:43.640]  how we got here to see where we're going this is from today's wall street journal
[3:33:43.640 --> 3:33:51.080]  the ceo pay increases heads for a new record isn't that great
[3:33:53.640 --> 3:34:00.280]  isn't that great and what do we have over here one in five workers run out of money
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:11.000]  before payday survey finds so on one end you got the ceo's getting richer and richer the big's
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:17.880]  getting bigger and bigger and everybody else getting poorer and poorer and you could think
[3:34:18.920 --> 3:34:24.920]  what the people call the republicans and the democrats that adults call a crime syndicate
[3:34:26.840 --> 3:34:36.200]  and that's all it is i mentioned jp morgan chase right let's go back to where they saw it
[3:34:36.200 --> 3:34:43.720]  the head of the nation's biggest bank the peanut farmer the peanut farmer
[3:34:43.720 --> 3:34:50.280]  probably would cojone smaller than a peanut oh yeah the guy that brought us the musha hadin
[3:34:52.280 --> 3:35:01.000]  yeah jimikata to fight the russians in afghanistan that became al-qaeda that musha hadin
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:10.440]  and who allegedly were the people on 9 11 oh saudis oh that musha hadin that kata created
[3:35:11.080 --> 3:35:17.240]  yeah he's the low life that did away with the banking system it was not such thing as when
[3:35:17.240 --> 3:35:24.120]  i was a young guy up until the 70s late 80s you know early late 70s there was no such thing as
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:31.480]  interstate banking bank of america was out in california do local banks everywhere
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:38.040]  then they allowed interest state but interstate banking was only interest state banking
[3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:43.480]  they did away with the usury lords oh you should talk about the gangs and the mafia
[3:35:43.480 --> 3:35:51.720]  they used to charge 10 interest chump changed what they allowed now kata kata and all the other
[3:35:51.720 --> 3:36:04.520]  criminals so there you got it the rich are getting richer and everybody else is getting poorer
[3:36:05.320 --> 3:36:13.960]  it's slave landia that's what they've created and talking about the propaganda and how people
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:22.680]  swallow it we'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the american public
[3:36:22.680 --> 3:36:32.600]  believes is false that was under william j kasey the jerk i can't say the word but it's
[3:36:32.600 --> 3:36:40.840]  awesome place over there kasey cia director said in 1981 we'll know our disinformation
[3:36:40.840 --> 3:36:48.840]  program is complete when everything the american public believes is false because the american
[3:36:48.840 --> 3:36:57.640]  public was stupid enough to believe little kohone nothing of a daddy's boy a clown of a clown a
[3:36:58.920 --> 3:37:06.200]  who's that guy in mad magazine that that little freaky guy looks just like a malphite newman bush
[3:37:06.200 --> 3:37:15.240]  we're gonna get that guy saddam who's saying dead or alive over there in afghanistan
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:19.800]  there isn't afghanistan so i'm gonna go get it oh and i love this stuff about how the russians

[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:33.160]  years was america in uh in in in afghanistan oh going on almost 20 how many years in iraq that you
[3:37:33.160 --> 3:37:43.080]  lost hey how about that libyan well i'm still going on one after another vietnam i only went from
[3:37:43.080 --> 3:37:51.000]  what god about oh i talked about jfk what happened after jfk not long after he made the deal
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:38:02.680]  we're russia the pull missiles out of turkey was opposed to the bay of pigs trying to overthrow
[3:38:02.680 --> 3:38:14.760]  kastro and catch dead man that's right for the military industrial complex eight months later
[3:38:14.760 --> 3:38:23.880]  linden johnson takes us to war oh you're talking about the russians losing the war so that was
[3:38:23.880 --> 3:38:35.400]  like 1963 and how long did the vietnam war go on to about 73 74 and you're talking about them being
[3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:40.760]  there just a couple of weeks and how terrible they're doing but the america media never covered the
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:51.640]  disasters of america's wars we are going into an economic crisis i wrote about this a long time ago
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:39:02.840]  people forget in 2019 there's a country by the name of germany that's the richest one in europe
[3:39:02.840 --> 3:39:09.160]  they were tens of a percentage point away from going into a recession officially
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:18.600]  there were protests of riots going on all over the world yellow vest movement protests
[3:39:18.600 --> 3:39:33.800]  to ryan algeria india lebanon peru bolivia chile all over the world and then covid came and he stopped
[3:39:33.800 --> 3:39:41.240]  all the protests the people were protesting against a lack of basic living standards government
[3:39:41.240 --> 3:39:52.120]  corruption crime and violence they artificially propped up the markets with all these low interest
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:40:00.520]  rates but going back to what i said it's nothing more than a crime syndicate they steal our money
[3:40:00.520 --> 3:40:05.800]  and give it to the jp morgens and the goldman sacks gang and the merrill lynch mob in the name of
[3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:12.200]  they're too big to fail hey you want out of 20 percent of american people living paycheck to paycheck
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:17.960]  you're just a piece of crap you're not too big to fail you could fail you could go to hell hey we
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:24.120]  ought to take care of jamie diamond in the gang we got to make sure that things get bigger the
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:29.720]  black stones the black rocks and all the companies by the way the all these companies buying up the
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:34.280]  housing market because people can't afford to live in them so you can rent them we'll rent them to you
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:43.080]  and it's a crime syndicate it's not a government
[3:40:46.200 --> 3:40:47.320]  so that's where we're at here

[3:44:03.560 --> 3:44:11.080]  is it even the people that die no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown on
[3:44:11.640 --> 3:44:18.920]  populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:28.360]  united states to europe legislations being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro russian

[3:48:58.280 --> 3:49:05.720]  with my language but that was that was a matter so that word about the the thing you know the a
[3:49:05.720 --> 3:49:12.760]  with a hole at the end of it i'm so my apologies i'm just quoting the man and again it's disrespectful
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:21.720]  because they have a very positive function anyway uk prime minister boris johnson told his cabinet
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:36.440]  that he wants to provide ukraine with quote more lethal military aid isn't that nice lethal deadly
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:43.560]  not nice more lethal aid
[3:49:45.640 --> 3:49:56.600]  in the united states of course more of our money going to lethal aid as the roads bridges
[3:49:56.600 --> 3:50:06.040]  is a collapsing degraded infrastructure homeless all over the place
[3:50:07.640 --> 3:50:10.760]  and how will money go into the military industrial complex
[3:50:13.080 --> 3:50:19.560]  Beijing reasserts closer relationship with Moscow i'm mentioning this because it's very important
[3:50:19.560 --> 3:50:30.840]  india and china we're about 1.4 billion people each where's that
[3:50:34.600 --> 3:50:36.200]  2.8 billion people
[3:50:39.640 --> 3:50:43.400]  just those two countries then you put europe
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:55.240]  and america together what do you have that's 780 million 780 million against
[3:50:57.800 --> 3:51:01.160]  2.8 billion and the winner is
[3:51:04.200 --> 3:51:08.840]  one of the things i do is a trend forecaster i go all over the world and look at the news
[3:51:08.840 --> 3:51:20.440]  i want more sides than one so i go to global times every day as well as the jewsland post
[3:51:21.480 --> 3:51:27.480]  far as news agency out of iran toss out of russia
[3:51:31.880 --> 3:51:35.240]  i go to all different sites i want to get this story
[3:51:35.240 --> 3:51:47.640]  you read the global times the chinese news and you see how they are so opposed to what
[3:51:47.640 --> 3:51:54.280]  america and nato is doing in fighting russia with the sanctions and they also state the
[3:51:54.280 --> 3:52:05.800]  wise that russia is doing it the unification between china and russia is going to continue and
[3:52:05.800 --> 3:52:14.360]  now there's talk about how was the united states going to get involved when not if china takes
[3:52:14.360 --> 3:52:22.280]  over taiwan by the way when i was a kid who was called formosa and what happened was when the
[3:52:22.280 --> 3:52:30.440]  matt when the chinese revolution finally overthrew the dictatorship over there they went to formosa
[3:52:30.440 --> 3:52:39.160]  with taiwan so china is going to take that back so now it's all the talk of how the united states
[3:52:39.800 --> 3:52:47.080]  and nato are going to stop china from doing this china's aligning itself with
[3:52:47.080 --> 3:52:55.720]  russia and russia is aligning itself with china and india oh and pakistan
[3:52:58.840 --> 3:53:06.200]  we're only getting one side of the story when you read what the chinese and the indian governments
[3:53:06.200 --> 3:53:13.080]  are saying they understand why russia did what it did again i'm totally opposed to war
[3:53:13.080 --> 3:53:18.680]  it things should have been worked out before this you could have done it in a number of ways i believe
[3:53:20.520 --> 3:53:29.080]  and by the way on the gerard selenti c e l e n t e channel on youtube i did an interview on friday
[3:53:29.640 --> 3:53:37.720]  with scott ridder former marine the guy that was in the un you know when he was doing about
[3:53:37.720 --> 3:53:43.720]  uh nuclear armaments and who had them and the disarmaments and knowing that sedan was saying
[3:53:43.720 --> 3:53:49.240]  didn't have weapons mass destruction and ties to al-qaeda it was blackball yeah did an interview
[3:53:49.240 --> 3:53:55.320]  with him please check it out it's one of the best i've ever done in my life and he's talking about
[3:53:55.320 --> 3:54:03.080]  how he was in russia and what was his role in russia and about the russian people and again how
[3:54:03.080 --> 3:54:10.600]  we're getting to hate them just like in world war one we hated the germans and in world war two we
[3:54:10.600 --> 3:54:16.520]  hated them too and in world war two we hated the japanese oh but we're doing business with all of
[3:54:16.520 --> 3:54:23.240]  them now right i mean how about vietnam war huh oh god when i grew up oh we hated those vietnamese
[3:54:23.240 --> 3:54:30.360]  those commies falling dominoes yeah that guy james buckley with his bs the dominoes are gonna keep
[3:54:30.360 --> 3:54:37.160]  falling and before you know it communism will be reaching the shores of california and now today we
[3:54:37.160 --> 3:54:46.920]  buy the number two exporter or that we buy from we import from our clothing and shoes are from vietnam
[3:54:47.880 --> 3:54:53.880]  so they're teaching us hatred and that's all the media has become and their prostitutes
[3:54:53.880 --> 3:55:00.680]  their media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps you look at that arrogant
[3:55:00.680 --> 3:55:06.120]  boy stefanophilus so where did he come from oh he was with the clinton administration wasn't he
[3:55:06.120 --> 3:55:14.120]  he had one after another down the line and now the word is that sake is you know exit into msnbc
[3:55:14.120 --> 3:55:24.680]  to join the other ones there can you imagine a government insider giving you information
[3:55:24.680 --> 3:55:30.360]  that you're supposed to swallow and the americans do so we're going to tell you a quick story about
[3:55:30.360 --> 3:55:37.320]  madeline albright or not all that bright i did a gig back in 2002 on the qe2 and it was for the
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:43.240]  top marketing executives around the world and we leave new york harbour but before we leave
[3:55:43.240 --> 3:55:52.280]  she gives her talk i swear to god they introduced it must have taken about 15 minutes she went to
[3:55:52.280 --> 3:55:56.840]  school here we've got her your honors degree there and her father did this and her mother did that
[3:55:56.840 --> 3:56:01.640]  and she became this she became that and she looked like the queen it taught so all dressed up in red
[3:56:01.640 --> 3:56:08.360]  this chuch so the next day they introduced me this is gerard selente the author of trends 2000
[3:56:08.360 --> 3:56:13.640]  trend tracking this is what the wall street journal says about him time new york times time magazine
[3:56:14.280 --> 3:56:18.920]  the economist blah blah blah blah and after the guy gave me the introduction i said thank you very
[3:56:18.920 --> 3:56:26.840]  much i said but i feel shortchanged after hearing madeline albright's introduction yesterday and
[3:56:26.840 --> 3:56:33.640]  the place broke out laughing and i said what you also forgot to mention is that i graduated ps 76 of
[3:56:33.640 --> 3:56:41.480]  the bronx without alms i'm mentioning this because it's a freak show and that's all we have running
[3:56:41.480 --> 3:56:52.200]  and ruining our lives you like mitch mcconnell how about chuckie schuma i like uh fat mouth

[3:57:46.280 --> 3:57:51.960]  and i'm not bragging when i say it it's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the
[3:57:51.960 --> 3:58:00.200]  standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist
[3:58:00.200 --> 3:58:08.120]  anti-human program and man our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects
