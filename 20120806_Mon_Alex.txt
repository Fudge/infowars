[00:33.400 --> 00:41.480]  minutes obviously obviously things are going crazy in the world of liberty this
[00:41.480 --> 00:49.280]  shooting at the Milwaukee Sikh temple is obviously a staged event and we're gonna
[00:49.280 --> 00:52.520]  break it down for you right here on the Alex Jones show for the next three
[00:52.520 --> 00:56.800]  hours and I want to thank you for joining us today we're gonna be taking
[00:56.800 --> 01:00.680]  calls and actually opening up the phones and specifically asking for calls
[01:00.680 --> 01:05.080]  from law enforcement who may have firsthand knowledge of whether there
[01:05.080 --> 01:10.720]  were drills in fact according to the news that's coming out Paul Watson is
[01:10.720 --> 01:15.000]  gonna be posting a story in just a few minutes on info wars.com that talks
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.680]  about the drills behind this so if you're a law enforcement officer a peace
[01:19.680 --> 01:26.080]  officer call us at 800-259-9231 and we'll get you on the air in about 15
[01:26.080 --> 01:28.560]  minutes or so between now and then we're gonna be breaking down this story
[01:28.560 --> 01:33.800]  Alex Jones will be joining us at the bottom of this hour with a call-in of
[01:33.800 --> 01:38.600]  his analysis breaking down the situation in addition he just posted a roughly
[01:38.600 --> 01:42.880]  two-minute video the latest update has just been posted on the real Alex Jones
[01:42.880 --> 01:47.920]  channel on YouTube.com we've got all of that and much more coming up there are
[01:47.920 --> 01:51.840]  similarities between this and the Aurora Colorado shooting we're gonna be
[01:51.840 --> 01:57.120]  going over those similarities I mean look folks look this guy this shooter
[01:57.120 --> 02:03.840]  were I mean Wade Michael Page where did he get his training psychological
[02:03.840 --> 02:11.200]  operations officer at the US Army base in Fort Bragg come on people come on I
[02:11.200 --> 02:15.960]  mean how more obvious does it need to get we've got an eyewitness saying that
[02:15.960 --> 02:22.160]  there were four shooters four men dressed in I think he describes black clothing
[02:22.160 --> 02:26.720]  probably tactical gear four men who were involved in the shooting that's from an
[02:26.720 --> 02:30.040]  eyewitness and we're gonna play that video just in a few minutes for you
[02:30.040 --> 02:38.120]  this smacks of a setup of a staged event for the same agenda as the Aurora
[02:38.120 --> 02:42.600]  Colorado shooting excuse me which is to of course blame the second amendment
[02:42.600 --> 02:48.400]  which is to demonize veterans again this shooter Michael Wade Page was a US Army
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.640]  veteran to demonize patriots and to call for the complete disarmament of the
[02:53.640 --> 02:58.040]  American public so that's what's going on major breaking news we're gonna be
[02:58.040 --> 03:01.080]  breaking it down but in addition to that we're gonna cover some other topics
[03:01.080 --> 03:08.000]  here a huge expose has just been published about the Susan G. Coman
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.840]  organization and their deceptions the British Medical Journal has published
[03:12.840 --> 03:17.600]  an article by two scientists who accuse Coman the Coman group Coman for the
[03:17.600 --> 03:22.240]  cure of running deceptive ads and tricking women into getting mammograms
[03:22.240 --> 03:27.480]  that have dubious benefits in fact the benefits have been greatly exaggerated
[03:27.480 --> 03:32.120]  and they may harm more women than they help so we're gonna be breaking down
[03:32.120 --> 03:37.440]  that story in more detail here also malicious lies about bottled water they
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.840]  want to add fluoride to all of your bottled water now by saying that bottled
[03:41.840 --> 03:47.640]  water harms your teeth because it doesn't have fluoride in it can you believe
[03:47.640 --> 03:53.680]  that it's a full-on assault in America today on on your brain on your mind it's
[03:53.680 --> 03:57.760]  all psychological operations it's all mind control it's all deception it's all
[03:57.760 --> 04:01.800]  theater they want you fluoridated they want you dumbed down they want you
[04:01.800 --> 04:06.320]  disinformed and we are here at info wars to combat all of that in the

[08:19.040 --> 08:24.720]  all right it is Monday August 6th 2012 you are listening to the Alex Jones show
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.600]  this is Mike Adams the health ranger sitting in for Alex today Alex will be
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.720]  joining us by phone for his update on the seek shooting and thank you for
[08:34.720 --> 08:37.720]  joining us for the next three hours we're going to be breaking down the
[08:37.720 --> 08:43.520]  details of this shooting which is an obvious psychological operation a Psyop
[08:43.520 --> 08:47.640]  it's obviously a staged event but we've got some other news that covers well
[08:47.640 --> 08:52.160]  there's breaking news in the world of cancer fraud and and attacks on bottled
[08:52.160 --> 08:55.680]  water how they're trying to fluoridate the population there's been a raid in
[08:55.680 --> 09:00.200]  Canada we're going to hit those later on but first let's break down the shooting
[09:00.200 --> 09:05.600]  situation in Milwaukee number one number one this is the thing to keep in
[09:05.600 --> 09:09.240]  mind oh and by the way the phones are opened up right now for law enforcement
[09:09.240 --> 09:14.400]  peace officers who may have knowledge of any drills that took place in Milwaukee
[09:14.400 --> 09:24.120]  before this shooting so call us at 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 the phones are
[09:24.120 --> 09:30.120]  open right now and we're asking for law enforcement or those with specific
[09:30.120 --> 09:34.520]  knowledge of drills that were taking place there because that's that's the
[09:34.520 --> 09:40.840]  MO here they scheduled drills and then they ran the drill and peace officers
[09:40.840 --> 09:45.960]  who had no idea that this was going to be a live shooting took they took part in
[09:45.960 --> 09:50.840]  the drills and then they showed up turns out we have a witness who says they
[09:50.840 --> 09:56.280]  they saw four men conducting the shooting not the lone gunman that's now
[09:56.280 --> 10:00.000]  being put out there by the media but four men and we're going to play that
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.400]  audio that actually that video with that witness for you in just a minute plus
[10:04.400 --> 10:09.520]  Alex Jones has posted a two-minute video on YouTube and we're going to we're
[10:09.520 --> 10:12.040]  going to be playing that for you here in just a few minutes it's the latest
[10:12.040 --> 10:16.040]  update the latest analysis of the situation but let's get down to the
[10:16.040 --> 10:24.320]  basics number one it's on people it is on the rollout of planned violence is
[10:24.320 --> 10:28.480]  underway in America this is it's only been what a couple of weeks since the
[10:28.480 --> 10:33.720]  Aurora Colorado shooting and that was obviously a staged event this is another
[10:33.720 --> 10:40.600]  stage event the shooter Wade Michael Page was an E4 psychological operations
[10:40.600 --> 10:46.440]  specialist with the US Army trained in Fort Bragg he received the Army
[10:46.440 --> 10:51.280]  commendation medal the Army achievement medal the Army good conduct award the
[10:51.280 --> 10:55.320]  National Defense Service Medal the humanitarian service medal in the
[10:55.320 --> 11:00.760]  parachutist badge this guy was a highly trained psychological operations
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.080]  specialist now what does that have to do with the agenda here think about it
[11:05.080 --> 11:11.640]  Aurora Colorado mind control research US government funded research NIH grant
[11:11.640 --> 11:17.960]  money to James Holmes that shooter who was an expert in mind control time
[11:17.960 --> 11:22.960]  shifts you know temporal shifting changing perception well and and this
[11:22.960 --> 11:28.760]  guy Michael Wade Page an expert in Psyop the whole thing was a Psyop the whole
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.480]  shooting was a Psyop except he probably didn't realize he was going to be the
[11:32.480 --> 11:37.080]  Patsy you see they never know they're going to be the Patsy it's like if you
[11:37.080 --> 11:42.200]  sit down at a game of poker and you don't know who the mark is you're the mark
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.680]  right this guy probably was taking part in what he thought was going to be a
[11:46.680 --> 11:50.240]  psychological operation this is just conjecture at this point this this
[11:50.240 --> 11:53.760]  statement and then he ended up being the Patsy and ended up being shot that's
[11:53.760 --> 11:57.440]  the other thing that these shootings have in common they always leave somebody
[11:57.440 --> 12:02.400]  behind to get shot or get arrested and in the case of James Holmes drugged in
[12:02.400 --> 12:07.280]  to oblivion so they can't talk all right now we are expecting in the next few
[12:07.280 --> 12:11.880]  minutes an article by Paul Watson to be posted on info wars.com so watch for
[12:11.880 --> 12:15.360]  that refresh that website every couple of minutes to get that information
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.840]  Drudge report is also of course covering this breaking news as it's coming out
[12:19.840 --> 12:24.440]  and we've got more analysis coming up for you right here on the Alex Jones show
[12:24.440 --> 12:29.600]  now as far as we know right now this was done this shooting was done with a
[12:29.600 --> 12:36.040]  semi-automatic pistol a 9 millimeter pistol now there is an effort underway
[12:36.040 --> 12:39.880]  out there in the liberal media especially to try to confuse people about
[12:39.880 --> 12:44.800]  what is an automatic weapon versus a semi-automatic weapon they're trying to
[12:44.800 --> 12:48.440]  get people to think that oh you could just go out and buy an automatic weapon
[12:48.440 --> 12:53.840]  no no you can't not legally they're hard to get they're very very expensive you
[12:53.840 --> 12:57.360]  want a fully automatic weapon you have to get you have to pay a tax stamp you
[12:57.360 --> 13:01.740]  have to get approval from the ATF and you have to pay anywhere from let's say
[13:01.740 --> 13:07.600]  12,000 to about $60,000 to buy a full auto weapon almost nobody can get those
[13:07.600 --> 13:11.880]  nobody's got that kind of money the weapons that are available today for
[13:11.880 --> 13:15.880]  armed legal citizens to purchase are semi-automatic which means you pull the
[13:15.880 --> 13:20.240]  trigger once for each round that goes out the barrel semi-automatic but that's
[13:20.240 --> 13:24.200]  what they're going after now that's part of the agenda here is to try to outlaw
[13:24.200 --> 13:28.720]  semi-automatic weapons like they did in Australia to make everybody turn in your
[13:28.720 --> 13:34.280]  weapons the disarmed the entire public and unbelievably even conservative talk
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.560]  show hosts have been on board pushing for this disarmament of the American
[13:38.560 --> 13:44.400]  public not telling people what really happens in those cases once the public
[13:44.400 --> 13:50.320]  is disarmed then the mass murder begins then the genocide begins this is what
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.760]  has happened throughout human history and to help explain that I've got a
[13:54.760 --> 13:58.560]  video coming out here we're going to show this later on probably in the third
[13:58.560 --> 14:04.400]  hour or two that talks about how your doctor is sixty two hundred percent more
[14:04.400 --> 14:08.920]  likely to kill you that a crazed a homicidal shooter is anyway so you got
[14:08.920 --> 14:12.920]  to get your head around the real risk assessment here the odds of being killed
[14:12.920 --> 14:18.640]  by a crazy homicidal shooter are so low in America they're just they're
[14:18.640 --> 14:22.280]  infinitesimally small you have a greater risk of being killed by a bee sting
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.680]  literally statistically speaking all right now this article by Paul Joseph
[14:26.680 --> 14:32.000]  Watson has just been posted it's red linked on info wars.com go there now
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.360]  check out this article here's the title seek temple shooter was an army
[14:36.360 --> 14:43.080]  psychological operations Batman shooter James Holmes also connected to army
[14:43.080 --> 14:46.840]  psychiatrist now I'm just seeing this for the first time but let me highlight it
[14:46.840 --> 14:50.600]  for you as best we can in real time right here and then we're going to go to the
[14:50.600 --> 14:55.000]  video of the witness who saw the shooter so get that queued up guys who saw who
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.640]  said there were four shooters here's the article with Paul Joseph Watson I'm not
[14:59.640 --> 15:01.400]  going to read the whole thing to you but let me give you the highlights
[15:01.400 --> 15:05.440]  following the pattern of numerous other mass shooters the accused gunman behind
[15:05.440 --> 15:09.880]  yesterday's massacre at a seek temple in Wisconsin worked in psychological
[15:09.880 --> 15:17.120]  operations while he was with the U.S. Army he has similarities to accuse
[15:17.120 --> 15:20.320]  Colorado shooter James Holmes who was treated by University of Colorado
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.680]  psychiatrist Dr. Lynn Fenton a former U.S. Air Force doctor questions have already
[15:26.680 --> 15:32.240]  been asked about what drugs Holmes was on such as Paxil Zoloft or Prozac which
[15:32.240 --> 15:37.320]  had been proven to induce violent tendencies in some people virtually all
[15:37.320 --> 15:41.480]  of the well-known mass shooting cases over the last 20 years were carried out
[15:41.480 --> 15:46.000]  by individuals who had been prescribed drugs by psychiatrists so this is
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.680]  another link is there a psychiatry drug behind this shooting as there have been
[15:51.680 --> 15:57.240]  with so many other shootings now here's here's the big breaking news right here
[15:57.240 --> 16:03.320]  the chairman of the temple that was targeted in this shooting says quote
[16:03.320 --> 16:09.840]  there were a few suspicious men were seen on temple premises before the
[16:09.840 --> 16:16.120]  shooting suggesting the involvement of more than one person and again this
[16:16.120 --> 16:21.640]  confirms the witness and let's run that video now the witness who saw four
[16:21.640 --> 16:24.800]  shooters or four men involved in the shooting raid go ahead and run that
[16:24.800 --> 16:29.600]  video right now our temple service every Sunday starts around 10 10 30 and
[16:29.600 --> 16:35.720]  usually goes in the afternoon and around 10 between 10 and 10 30 for white males
[16:35.720 --> 16:40.400]  who were dressed darkly just an all-black clothing came in and open
[16:40.400 --> 16:47.840]  fired on the congregation and what I'm told about 20 to 25 people have been
[16:47.840 --> 16:53.640]  hit my uncle one of them he's been taken to the hospital I don't know how many
[16:53.640 --> 16:58.600]  others have been taken to the hospital but basically there are people hiding in
[16:58.600 --> 17:03.440]  there right now there were I don't know how many left one of the government is
[17:03.440 --> 17:08.280]  down so there's three left where the spring everyone gets out safely there's
[17:08.280 --> 17:14.920]  a captain he's got them all right yeah that's that's that's good right there so
[17:14.920 --> 17:19.400]  so that audio was not great but if I heard it correctly he said there were
[17:19.400 --> 17:24.840]  four white males that came in and started shooting and that was an
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.560]  associated press video by the way that that that wasn't just somebody with a
[17:29.560 --> 17:35.120]  webcam there or a phone cam associated press videos so look you know one thing
[17:35.120 --> 17:37.400]  that that strikes me and by the way phones are open we're going to go to
[17:37.400 --> 17:41.280]  calls here in a second one thing that strikes me is odd that guy seemed really
[17:41.280 --> 17:46.160]  really calm now I'm not saying he's not who he says he is maybe he's had some
[17:46.160 --> 17:51.200]  emergency training or he's seen combat before or he's an EMT or something but
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.000]  one of the weird things about all these shootings is that a lot of the witnesses
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.880]  that talk to the news they are eerily calm they're not running around panic
[18:00.880 --> 18:05.640]  like most everyday people would be it's like they they've dealt with combat
[18:05.640 --> 18:08.800]  before and then they suddenly show up talking to the cameras and witnesses
[18:08.800 --> 18:12.480]  again I'm not saying that guy isn't isn't who he says he is but as we're
[18:12.480 --> 18:16.120]  piecing this story together you have to start red flagging things that seem
[18:16.120 --> 18:22.120]  strange things that don't add up now we want to pursue this this lead about the
[18:22.120 --> 18:25.560]  chairman of the temple stating that there were a few suspicious men seen on
[18:25.560 --> 18:30.600]  the temple premises we want to follow this lead about the four men carrying
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.000]  out the attack and why the mainstream media has now gone to the lone gunman
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.920]  theory sounds sound familiar they always do that Jfk shooting and
[18:39.920 --> 18:43.600]  everything else instead of the four men carrying out the attack as was
[18:43.600 --> 18:49.480]  described by a witness and we also want to follow up on the drill aspect of this
[18:49.480 --> 18:54.240]  so with that said I want to go to some calls right now we've got a police
[18:54.240 --> 18:58.360]  officer anonymous in California you're on the air on the Alston show go ahead
[18:58.360 --> 19:03.920]  what do you think about all this well I like to see more evidence in law
[19:03.920 --> 19:09.120]  enforcement we would look to the security cameras that are you know supposed to be
[19:09.120 --> 19:13.320]  there for incidents like this and then we could kind of rule out a lot of
[19:13.320 --> 19:19.160]  speculation yeah that's a great point but as often happens in these cases the
[19:19.160 --> 19:23.000]  security footage gets seized I mean look at look at 9-11 all the all the
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.760]  video camera footage from there it all sees and went into the memory hole it
[19:26.760 --> 19:33.000]  all disappeared do you do you have you heard anything about drills like this
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.440]  we'll have a few seconds but go ahead your comments well first off the shooter
[19:38.440 --> 19:44.920]  was a less than honorably discharged and he was demoted so he wasn't really a
[19:44.920 --> 19:50.160]  ball player with the military all right good point less than honorably
[19:50.160 --> 19:55.000]  discharged but he was awarded all kinds of medals which is interesting we'll
[19:55.000 --> 20:01.720]  get into more background as we return stay with us the worst drought in 50
[20:01.720 --> 20:05.720]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on
[20:05.720 --> 20:10.680]  record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but
[20:10.680 --> 20:15.440]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[20:15.440 --> 20:19.240]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your
[20:19.240 --> 20:23.560]  food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at
[20:23.560 --> 20:28.000]  today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.760]  price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise prices to now

[23:10.120 --> 23:13.560]  about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in the mainstream
[23:13.560 --> 23:17.480]  news every day millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks
[23:17.480 --> 23:21.600]  because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its
[23:21.600 --> 23:25.880]  capacity I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts
[23:25.880 --> 23:30.080]  and if you don't have a backup system in place I've got a great opportunity for

[23:51.320 --> 23:58.960]  the details at beat the blackouts.com that's beat the blackouts.com
[24:00.760 --> 24:06.480]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones only on
[24:06.480 --> 24:19.920]  the GCN radio network it is frustrating to have to deal with this rollout of
[24:19.920 --> 24:27.760]  tyranny in America and then to hear it called domestic terrorism how can they
[24:27.760 --> 24:32.080]  call it domestic terrorism you know just just a random act of violence even if
[24:32.080 --> 24:37.000]  there were no false flag behind it even if it were seriously just a psychotic
[24:37.000 --> 24:40.520]  shooter on psychiatric drugs that was a random act of violence that's not
[24:40.520 --> 24:44.720]  terrorism that's just a random act of violence to be domestic terrorism it has
[24:44.720 --> 24:50.960]  to be violence that is used to achieve a specific agenda so then it is terrorism
[24:50.960 --> 24:56.160]  once you understand the false flag behind it it is in essence a agenda
[24:56.160 --> 24:59.280]  driven terrorism against the people against our liberties against our
[24:59.280 --> 25:03.960]  freedoms but for the mainstream media to call it terrorism and say it's it's a
[25:03.960 --> 25:07.840]  it's a white supremacist or it's a veteran committing terrorism that is
[25:07.840 --> 25:12.680]  completely false even just basic under the basic definitions of logic it's not
[25:12.680 --> 25:19.200]  every bad act isn't terrorism so anyway Alex Jones has just posted a video on
[25:19.200 --> 25:22.920]  YouTube we're going to go to that right now it's about two minutes long run that
[25:22.920 --> 25:27.720]  video for his analysis. Ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here with breaking
[25:27.720 --> 25:33.960]  information I knew it it's always the same the supposed shooter who's
[25:33.960 --> 25:38.600]  conveniently been killed and notice the police showed up in mass in just minutes
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.800]  with their armored war wagons was an army psychological operations specialist
[25:43.800 --> 25:49.320]  or PSYOP specialist that's the LA Times they're always doing shooting drills at
[25:49.320 --> 25:53.320]  Sikh temples because right-wing type folks always confuse them as what they
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.640]  think of as Central Asian al-Qaeda types when they're not even Muslims it's
[25:57.640 --> 26:03.080]  just amazing and it's the timing of it all the anti-gun legislation the whole
[26:03.080 --> 26:06.960]  nine yards you've got the chairman of the Sikh temple saying guys were casing
[26:06.960 --> 26:10.960]  it in the days before weird guys multiple witnesses saying four men in black
[26:10.960 --> 26:15.560]  uniforms multiple shooters all of that being memory hold you've got the Batman
[26:15.560 --> 26:19.600]  shooter on psychotropics under a top Air Force psychologist who was over the
[26:19.600 --> 26:23.320]  biggest Air Force base in the US out in San Antonio moves out there just to be
[26:23.320 --> 26:26.880]  over him he told them everything he was going to do but they stood down just a
[26:26.880 --> 26:30.960]  drugged-up patsy you either drug up the patsy as operation north woods breaks
[26:30.960 --> 26:36.600]  down or you kill them like Lee Harvey Oswald this is incredible this is
[26:36.600 --> 26:41.880]  absolutely amazing that it's this sloppy when you understand these things take
[26:41.880 --> 26:45.200]  the 7-7 bombings that came out in Fox News and even London Telegraph that it
[26:45.200 --> 26:50.120]  was run by MI6 through this is SWAT gentleman who was MI6 look at that
[26:50.120 --> 26:57.040]  psychological operation specialist Wade Michael Page Wade Michael Page this is
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.680]  amazing look for more of this what was it six seven years ago outside Fort Bragg
[27:01.680 --> 27:05.120]  they were doing secret drills and they try to disarm police Fort Bragg troops
[27:05.120 --> 27:08.840]  dead and got killed you can look data ladies and gentlemen if you're in the
[27:08.840 --> 27:12.840]  police or military do not take part in these drills when they're small because
[27:12.840 --> 27:16.600]  that's when they can set you up and they will kill you or they will electro
[27:16.600 --> 27:20.520]  shock therapy and drug you and have you roll out and say you did it this is a
[27:20.520 --> 27:24.920]  sigh up the timing has certainly got fast and furious another admitted stage
[27:24.920 --> 27:29.640]  false flag sigh up out of the news myself and Mike Adams will cover it all
[27:29.640 --> 27:34.480]  today t-minus about 10 minutes at info wars dot com with the three-hour
[27:34.480 --> 27:39.280]  syndicated radio transmission all right the number one warning there from Alex
[27:39.280 --> 27:44.040]  is if you are a member of military or law enforcement do not take part in these
[27:44.040 --> 27:48.760]  drills because you may end up being set up you may end up being directed to
[27:48.760 --> 27:54.160]  actually take part in a shooting for a specific agenda a political purpose so
[27:54.160 --> 27:59.280]  again Alex Jones issuing a warning to military and law enforcement he will
[27:59.280 --> 28:02.320]  also be joining us by phone in a few minutes right now we're going to go to

[33:25.280 --> 33:30.320]  with us we've got the detailed breakdown and analysis of the real story at
[33:30.320 --> 33:34.320]  least as we are piecing it together it's obviously developing of the Sikh
[33:34.320 --> 33:39.880]  temple shooting in Wisconsin and we've just been handed additional details on
[33:39.880 --> 33:45.240]  the shooter the links to psychological operations get even deeper this is
[33:45.240 --> 33:50.000]  thanks to analysis being conducted by Info Wars writers Kurt Nemo and Paul
[33:50.000 --> 33:53.240]  Joseph Watson who are hard at work digging into the history of the shooter
[33:53.240 --> 33:57.680]  we've also got Alex Jones joining us now by phone with additional analysis is
[33:57.680 --> 34:02.680]  Alex coming through okay all right Alex hey how you doing Mike thank you for
[34:02.680 --> 34:08.000]  doing the broadcast hey ladies and gentlemen yesterday I came out with
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.120]  videos it said that it could be one of three things a totally staged false
[34:13.120 --> 34:17.960]  black event where they pat see they set up in a drill that video is up in at
[34:17.960 --> 34:23.360]  fallwars.com where I ask is the Sikh temple shooting a staged false flag I
[34:23.360 --> 34:27.480]  said number two it could be provocateur white supremacist you know
[34:27.480 --> 34:33.920]  idiot types that they have to be on provocateurs and sets up or it could be
[34:33.920 --> 34:37.800]  a lone wolf because we've seen a few of these attacks thinking of the Sikhs who
[34:37.800 --> 34:41.480]  aren't models by the way you know look like the archetypal Central Asian
[34:41.480 --> 34:50.320]  Taliban type with their with their turbans now as soon as it came out that
[34:50.320 --> 34:54.600]  he was army shy off everything fell into place just like we said but the
[34:54.600 --> 34:59.720]  Colorado shooter holds in these under government psychiatrists for military
[34:59.720 --> 35:04.680]  connection do you think giving government grants if he had months where he was
[35:04.680 --> 35:08.720]  missing from family in people report other shooters and people throwing
[35:08.720 --> 35:13.840]  smoke bombs if there is a drill if there is gun legislation that's key at the
[35:13.840 --> 35:19.200]  very time which of course there was in and enters the quadrant of a staged
[35:19.200 --> 35:24.320]  event okay the reason we know this is Operation Northwood's Pentagon document
[35:24.320 --> 35:29.080]  tells how to shoot people in US cities and blame pat sees operation Ajax did
[35:29.080 --> 35:35.240]  this operation gladio was over 500 bombings and shootings in Europe in the
[35:35.240 --> 35:40.560]  60s 70s and 80s carried out by NATO in Europe every time political group got
[35:40.560 --> 35:44.160]  uppity whether they were right wing or communist it didn't matter they would
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.320]  blow up schools shoot up buses shoot up police stations shoot up little kids
[35:48.320 --> 35:51.880]  walking off from school blow up bus stations to blame their political
[35:51.880 --> 35:58.320]  enemies I'm here to announce to everyone that this now is 99% confirmed
[35:58.320 --> 36:02.160]  it as I've been saying the last two years warning people top democratic
[36:02.160 --> 36:06.760]  operatives the financial times of London but also in three different internal
[36:06.760 --> 36:12.560]  fundraisers the last two years to their dollars Mike I'm coming for good to
[36:12.560 --> 36:17.640]  yeah yeah it's all good continuing here this is a maximum import ladies and
[36:17.640 --> 36:22.520]  gentlemen I've sent out letters that even Fox says discovered saying don't worry
[36:22.520 --> 36:27.440]  of Obama's down in a pole there's gonna be state shootings and bombings that are
[36:27.440 --> 36:31.120]  gonna help Obama reconnect with the public and they'll be blamed on our
[36:31.120 --> 36:36.480]  enemies now they don't say they're going to do it they're one millimeter but
[36:36.480 --> 36:39.520]  that's how dumb they think we are from saying they'll do it they just say these
[36:39.520 --> 36:43.880]  attacks will happen they will be blamed on our enemies Obama will pose as a
[36:43.880 --> 36:48.280]  savior their homeland security says prepare for veterans the stomach bombing
[36:48.280 --> 36:52.440]  and shooting and killing in mass they are your new enemy forget all kind of
[36:52.440 --> 36:55.320]  they're now the good guys we're helping them fight living in Syria
[36:55.320 --> 36:58.960]  hey look I thought they're helpful and loving it forgive the government got the
[36:58.960 --> 37:02.680]  underwear bomber on the plane or the Times Square guy was run by a lot he was
[37:02.680 --> 37:06.840]  admitted Pentagon Fox there's a safety to press so again I'm giving you a few of
[37:06.840 --> 37:09.800]  the thousands of data points I've got I'm not exaggerating when I say thousands
[37:09.800 --> 37:15.800]  okay now continuing here I live this listen to me police military this is so
[37:15.800 --> 37:20.320]  important they're now going to flip homeland security against the American
[37:20.320 --> 37:24.600]  people this is a made-up situation now that we've learned that this gentleman was
[37:24.600 --> 37:30.000]  a army psychological warfare officer from the home of army psychological
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.560]  warfare they've got one base in Florida but the big ones at Fort Bryan this is
[37:34.560 --> 37:39.040]  how these work they have a drill and the word is from all the trucks the head of
[37:39.040 --> 37:43.400]  the school at the head of the church the director that there were all these
[37:43.400 --> 37:47.280]  weird men around that the police were there in minutes
[37:47.280 --> 37:52.760]  multiple witnesses not just the one you play not just the police scanners but
[37:52.760 --> 37:56.360]  other witnesses have come out saying that we're four men shooting it was
[37:56.360 --> 38:03.200]  coordinated in black uniforms black head to toe dress now how does this work you
[38:03.200 --> 38:07.480]  have someone who's part of the silent team who thinks they're taking part in a
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.600]  drill they have drills that are secret where you're seeing if you can face the
[38:11.600 --> 38:16.600]  joint and seeing in police respond or seeing if you can get weapons through an
[38:16.600 --> 38:19.680]  airport or send you get on board hijacked we know they were running
[38:19.680 --> 38:22.960]  drills out of the plug on with the 9-11 hijackers who were training dress
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.480]  bases that came out the news but all of that is just ignored so they get their
[38:27.480 --> 38:31.760]  own agents just like 7-7 in London that it turned out was a state's event with
[38:31.760 --> 38:37.120]  the drill and a squad it was in my six set up the guys they thought they were
[38:37.120 --> 38:41.120]  taking part in a drill a fourth group figured it out ran the machine gun that
[38:41.120 --> 38:45.720]  canary war that came out the news it's always the same MO over and over again
[38:45.720 --> 38:51.280]  so they follow a playbook it was a drill and that's what all the neighbors the
[38:51.280 --> 38:54.720]  locals and witnesses are saying it's all over the dish if there was a drill
[38:54.720 --> 38:59.000]  police driving around all this activity just like with the Madrid box and it
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  came out that that was a government off and the government got removed in Spain
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.960]  over the Madrid bombings remember that look it up folks where they blow up an
[39:07.960 --> 39:11.280]  apartment building to get rid of the past they throw them they shoot them or
[39:11.280 --> 39:15.240]  they bomb the past because like we are the Oswald just like big they had a top
[39:15.240 --> 39:19.720]  army psychological warfare chief over him the number two guy inside warfare
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.680]  in all of US history tolly in west the main protogeans under you and Cameron
[39:24.680 --> 39:28.160]  right they seem to sound police and military look it up you're gonna
[39:28.160 --> 39:34.000]  understand this is real now the timing five bills to ban all semi-autos the
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.160]  possession of them to ban it clips above 10 rounds to register ammo when you buy
[39:39.160 --> 39:43.400]  it at the store to ban online sales it's all happening and racing through
[39:43.400 --> 39:46.840]  Congress the UN treaty it's not that it's just held up for two months
[39:46.840 --> 39:52.880]  there's an openly said it with bad guts ladies and gentlemen the fact listen
[39:52.880 --> 39:58.280]  I saw the video last night anyone this morning I said it could be a crazy
[39:58.280 --> 40:03.360]  right-winger he's got you know quote remember 9-11 tattoo on him who thought
[40:03.360 --> 40:08.120]  these were muslims an army psychological warfare officer he's gonna know what a
[40:08.120 --> 40:13.800]  seek is the bottle we're always warring with the muslims opposite group he's
[40:13.800 --> 40:18.200]  gonna know if he's gonna go and kill some muslims like sergeant males who's
[40:18.200 --> 40:21.440]  on a bunch of psychopaths in Afghanistan which I believe was a mind-control
[40:21.440 --> 40:24.880]  test we know his person you have to care of the pentagon and it was shit back
[40:24.880 --> 40:28.480]  getting not to be and been running around acting crazy police are the rest of
[40:28.480 --> 40:33.800]  them but that had been an expunge so again there's no way an army psychological
[40:33.800 --> 40:38.360]  warfare expert officer mid-level would not know what seeks were if he went
[40:38.360 --> 40:42.360]  crazy he'd go to a mosque and kill people if you really just go bottle the
[40:42.360 --> 40:46.360]  kool-aid and the propaganda when they're actually funding I'll cut it a great
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.120]  class of civilization yeah Alex yes sir Kurt Nemo's working on an article
[40:51.120 --> 40:57.960]  right now that is shows the links between the shooter and the FBI run
[40:57.960 --> 41:03.480]  National Alliance apparently the Southern Poverty Law Center is linking the
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.240]  shooter a Wade Michael Page to the National Alliance which is you know a
[41:08.240 --> 41:12.720]  neo-nazi group but it's controlled by the FBI as you know that's been reported
[41:12.720 --> 41:17.200]  I said I said if I have to profile this they're gonna blame it on a white
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.800]  supremacist and again I'm not I'm not toot my horn I know what I'm talking
[41:21.800 --> 41:25.440]  about because they follow a script the Southern Poverty Law Center it turned out
[41:25.440 --> 41:29.680]  in federal documents was running the L.A. city center with the white supremacist
[41:29.680 --> 41:33.680]  that they was there not infiltrating it reading it so listen here's the bottom
[41:33.680 --> 41:37.360]  line I'm gonna get off my here's the bottom line for everybody there is no
[41:37.360 --> 41:40.360]  doubt in my mind because I mean I go with what I really believe I don't just
[41:40.360 --> 41:44.720]  say it's an inside job to say it this thing has all the hallmarks of a sloppy
[41:44.720 --> 41:49.480]  false flag where they killed one of their own people in the drill or a police
[41:49.480 --> 41:54.680]  officer responded so quick he killed one of the black opt-ins we don't know but
[41:54.680 --> 41:58.320]  it's leaning towards the whole things a setup completely a pure
[41:58.320 --> 42:03.640]  manufactured event this is Operation Gladio being implemented inside the
[42:03.640 --> 42:09.560]  United States this is also known as the NATO option write this down NATO option
[42:09.560 --> 42:13.560]  Operation Gladio we sell a bit by a professor who's an expert on it at
[42:13.560 --> 42:19.520]  info wars.com breaking it down in the shop area you know that they film a noble
[42:19.520 --> 42:23.240]  lie all of this we've been telling you since noble I came out why am I
[42:23.240 --> 42:26.880]  promoting that film because it's the same playbook the Justice Department that's
[42:26.880 --> 42:32.800]  like if they stage the full flag event ladies and gentlemen if they would stage
[42:32.800 --> 42:39.040]  the full flag event of fast and furious they would stage anything this is the
[42:39.040 --> 42:44.400]  October surprise this is how Obama plans to stay in power this is how they plan
[42:44.400 --> 42:48.240]  to go after domestic groups this is number two months ago our insiders told
[42:48.240 --> 42:51.520]  us they were going to watch PSM the Street Station line not just select areas
[42:51.520 --> 42:55.680]  now it's happening now they're saying mall shootings they hit it they I've said
[42:55.680 --> 43:01.040]  churches police departments malls movie theaters it's everything that the TSA is
[43:01.040 --> 43:06.680]  rolling out of their training videos they are coming for us all this is a
[43:06.680 --> 43:14.280]  staged event you better believe it my gut tells me 100% again I'm ranting here
[43:14.280 --> 43:18.840]  ladies and gentlemen because the magnitude of this police we then police
[43:18.840 --> 43:22.760]  call in and the FBI has asked them and the ATF to sneak a bomb to the airport
[43:22.760 --> 43:27.360]  and they've been smart enough in Texas to say no including Robert Mueller Airport
[43:27.360 --> 43:32.320]  where they've set up this weird base now into these training drills and it's
[43:32.320 --> 43:35.840]  not even airport anymore but they want to do a drill practicing to take one in
[43:35.840 --> 43:39.320]  there where they do the SWAT team training they tried it up at Dallas at
[43:39.320 --> 43:45.440]  DFW this is the type of stuff that's going on at 95% of the time the drill is
[43:45.440 --> 43:50.200]  real it doesn't take place but every time they do it there's a drill and then
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.720]  they will set you up ladies and gentlemen and they want to start
[43:54.720 --> 43:58.600]  persecuting the military and police and they have set up the narrative imagine
[43:58.600 --> 44:01.200]  how ridiculous the narrative is that the veterans are gonna come home and
[44:01.200 --> 44:04.840]  kill everybody that's because they know they're gonna start gun confiscation and
[44:04.840 --> 44:08.600]  veterans will fight back so the only group they know that they resist the
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.560]  banker takeover is the military and veterans so they're preparing to turn
[44:12.560 --> 44:16.720]  homeland security completely against you that was always the plan this is a
[44:16.720 --> 44:25.240]  day-to-day situation repeat witnesses the police scanners the head of the of
[44:25.240 --> 44:30.920]  the Sikh church are all saying there were people there there were men in
[44:30.920 --> 44:34.800]  uniforms there were cars driving around there were four scooters this is the
[44:34.800 --> 44:39.000]  truth this is what's happening this is what's going on it's all happening
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.400]  leading up to the election they're probably gonna block federal building
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.800]  next they're gonna blame it on us they're not playing games these are criminal
[44:46.800 --> 44:52.320]  the chip 40,000 guns that angered Mexico to blame the Second Amendment I got
[44:52.320 --> 44:55.600]  what you make of this I concur with you Alex I think this is just the beginning
[44:55.600 --> 45:00.680]  I think that the pattern is very clear now and you just mentioned you think
[45:00.680 --> 45:05.480]  maybe they're gonna try to stage blowing up federal buildings I certainly
[45:05.480 --> 45:09.560]  wouldn't put that out of their reach I I think they could be looking to do
[45:09.560 --> 45:13.760]  something even bigger I've written about this too and look the something bigger
[45:13.760 --> 45:20.280]  like a like a dirty bomb nuclear attack in a major u.s. city for example exactly
[45:20.280 --> 45:24.720]  all the scripting remember this then I'll let you go back to your work they
[45:24.720 --> 45:29.240]  were in all these memos and news articles how there's gonna be giant terror and how
[45:29.240 --> 45:34.080]  they're gonna blame it off oh yeah it's and and look the worst Obama gets in the
[45:34.080 --> 45:38.640]  polls the more desperate his controllers are to make sure that he is
[45:38.640 --> 45:42.640]  perceived as a hero so that he wins exactly notice how this is not fast
[45:42.640 --> 45:46.480]  and furious out of the news notice how this is what knocked out kiter hopefully
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.320]  being brought in by a criminal government in Syria out of it's not to get
[45:50.320 --> 45:55.880]  all out of the news by design Mike Adams God bless you they every time I take off
[45:55.880 --> 45:58.920]  to just take care of bunch of the work I've got to do when these big events
[45:58.920 --> 46:03.240]  happen to get police and military I know we have a lot of former and current
[46:03.240 --> 46:11.360]  people listening officer go in today seek area and shoot them see the reason
[46:11.360 --> 46:14.520]  this is a sign off is they want to stop making it the Muslims the reason they're
[46:14.520 --> 46:19.040]  taking our liberty they still they're changing the script domestic groups this
[46:19.040 --> 46:24.080]  is all done and aimed at a unconscious population so now they need to shift it
[46:24.080 --> 46:27.720]  over to right wing groups I mean this whole thing is tailored ladies and
[46:27.720 --> 46:31.360]  gentlemen God bless you Mike Adams thank you so much sir God bless you too Alex
[46:31.360 --> 46:34.960]  thanks for calling in thanks for the analysis so folks if you want more from
[46:34.960 --> 46:38.080]  Alex check out his video on YouTube and we're going to continue bringing you
[46:38.080 --> 46:41.800]  more details right here on the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams filling in
[46:41.800 --> 46:45.400]  today for Alex and it does it's it's crazy seems like every time that I'm
[46:45.400 --> 46:50.800]  guest hosting and that Alex is not here some big breaking news happens hours
[46:50.800 --> 46:55.440]  before and then you know we end up reworking the entire show we were going
[46:55.440 --> 46:59.920]  to be talking today to a vaccine rights attorney Alan Phillips for example and
[46:59.920 --> 47:04.640]  we we asked to reschedule him because again of this breaking news it's
[47:04.640 --> 47:08.920]  happening right now but going over the big points once again as Alex just told
[47:08.920 --> 47:15.000]  us this is a pattern this is indicative of the Gladio project the NATO option of
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.840]  staging these false flag events in order to create the reaction in the in the
[47:20.840 --> 47:25.360]  hearts and minds of the public to be against the selected target group which
[47:25.360 --> 47:30.360]  in this case is the veterans they they want the people not to trust veterans
[47:30.360 --> 47:35.240]  because it's probably only veterans well and maybe a few others but for sure
[47:35.240 --> 47:38.920]  veterans who are willing to stand up against tyranny and actually follow
[47:38.920 --> 47:43.680]  their oath of protecting the US Constitution against all enemies
[47:43.680 --> 47:49.280]  foreign and domestic so veterans are in the crosshairs of being demonized the
[47:49.280 --> 47:54.080]  Second Amendment is being demonized there is a mass it's almost like a cult
[47:54.080 --> 48:00.680]  now that has taken over the mass media to try to demonize everybody and make
[48:00.680 --> 48:05.120]  blame everyone for the the actions of this one individual which might have
[48:05.120 --> 48:09.360]  actually been a team of tactical shooters with a specific agenda but look
[48:09.360 --> 48:16.720]  at this CNN just played the song only the good die young by Billy Joel
[48:16.720 --> 48:21.800]  following a segment about the Sikh temple shootings so remember CNN this is
[48:21.800 --> 48:26.720]  remember eight days ago they played the song stupid girls right before a story
[48:26.720 --> 48:31.960]  about former Alaska governor Sarah Palin now they're playing the song only the
[48:31.960 --> 48:37.200]  good die young when covering the Sikh shooting so that's the kind of sick
[48:37.200 --> 48:44.840]  sense of the culture of death that these people at CNN have is just just sick
[48:44.840 --> 48:51.320]  terrible human beings who who pretend to bring people to news let's go now we've
[48:51.320 --> 48:56.680]  only got a short segment here before we go to break but mark is on the air
[48:56.680 --> 49:00.280]  former police and military from Texas mark we've only got a minute so I want
[49:00.280 --> 49:03.680]  to keep you over but what's what are your comments on the situation sir go
[49:03.680 --> 49:10.320]  ahead yeah my my comments to this I think that this guy was probably processed
[49:10.320 --> 49:16.040]  out secretly and I don't believe he ever actually was processed out kind of like
[49:16.040 --> 49:21.400]  I think happened with McGray and possibly even with Lee Harvey Oswald yeah this is
[49:21.400 --> 49:27.840]  a blackout there's no question about it I would like to tell people all around
[49:27.840 --> 49:32.880]  the country listen to people like Alex Jones even a regular talk show are
[49:32.880 --> 49:38.160]  afraid to cover this Fox News begin it just like the mainstream media nobody
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.240]  wants to cover this I've put the pieces together and one other thing too about
[49:42.240 --> 49:48.560]  the six a lot of people don't understand a white supremacists have nothing
[49:48.560 --> 49:54.080]  against people like the six because they believe they're basically Indo-Europeans
[49:54.080 --> 50:00.120]  who migrate to India they're basically you know remnants of Alexander the Great
[50:00.120 --> 50:07.120]  so this would not be a extreme right-wing thing this is no doubt the
[50:07.120 --> 50:10.840]  government taking taking advantage of the stupidity but they think it is
[50:10.840 --> 50:16.480]  stupidity of the American people and a complacency of the prestitute press well
[50:16.480 --> 50:19.520]  sure they know that people are going to buy into this they buy into anything
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.800]  that they're told repeatedly over and over again in a hypnotic tone I mean it
[50:23.800 --> 50:27.800]  the whole thing is a psychological operation which is of course what this
[50:27.800 --> 50:33.040]  shooter was reportedly trained in and you just said that maybe he was still part
[50:33.040 --> 50:38.240]  of the military a secretly taken out of the military but still connected to it
[50:38.240 --> 50:42.680]  we got to go to break but I want you to hold on because I want to ask you do are
[50:42.680 --> 50:47.240]  you aware of other examples of that happening where they're still working
[50:47.240 --> 50:51.440]  for a secret group within the military even though officially they're no longer
[50:51.440 --> 50:55.760]  part of it so stay with us mark from Texas as we go to break we'll be right

[54:24.840 --> 54:32.160]  all right welcome back to the Alex Jones show Mike Adams filling in for Alex as
[54:32.160 --> 54:38.160]  we continue to break down the details of this shooting in Oak Park at the Sikh
[54:38.160 --> 54:46.720]  Temple in Milwaukee this this looks like it fits the pattern of another staged
[54:46.720 --> 54:52.160]  event and we've got some more details coming in here this is thanks to a
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.040]  blogger and by the way we're gonna go we're gonna go back to the caller here
[54:55.040 --> 55:01.200]  in just a second but turns out that one of the people shot was linked to the
[55:01.200 --> 55:09.600]  film Sirius S-I-R-I-U-S that is like like the name of the star you know the
[55:09.600 --> 55:17.960]  constellation star the dog star he was the director's father and his name is
[55:17.960 --> 55:25.680]  arm Kaleika the Sirius filmmaker arm Kaleika's father was killed at the Sikh
[55:25.680 --> 55:32.760]  Temple so arm Kaleika himself was not a victim but his father was a victim now
[55:32.760 --> 55:36.640]  arm Kaleika and this is just coming in to me here this is the first time I'm
[55:36.640 --> 55:46.640]  hearing this he is working on a movie that is what in race against timeline
[55:46.640 --> 55:52.280]  for false flag alien invasion I gotta I gotta learn more about what this is all
[55:52.280 --> 55:57.840]  about this was posted by dr. Greer on dr. Greer's a blog I'm gonna get into more
[55:57.840 --> 56:03.440]  of this but apparently this is something about the disclosure project and some
[56:03.440 --> 56:06.680]  kind of a cover-up you know how the media has been pushing this this you know
[56:06.680 --> 56:11.960]  alien invasion agenda for a long time apparently this was this was a film
[56:11.960 --> 56:18.720]  being worked on by Kaleika that is investigating this issue the false flag
[56:18.720 --> 56:21.960]  alien invasion I don't know I I'm gonna have to get into that to get more
[56:21.960 --> 56:26.120]  details but his father reportedly killed in this shooting so let's start
[56:26.120 --> 56:31.160]  connecting the dots again a lot of this folks is we this is just breaking so we
[56:31.160 --> 56:34.720]  don't know the full picture yet what we're doing is collecting data points
[56:34.720 --> 56:38.680]  now and and we're gonna start connecting those data points filtering out
[56:38.680 --> 56:42.000]  things that don't get confirmed or that don't add up and then putting together
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.440]  the pieces of the puzzle that do add up to create the collage of reality which
[56:47.440 --> 56:52.920]  is the the false flag agenda behind all of these shootings at least that is what
[56:52.920 --> 56:55.960]  looks likely we don't have a hundred percent proof of it yet there's still a
[56:55.960 --> 57:02.160]  chance that this is just truly some lone psychotic shooter suffering from the
[57:02.160 --> 57:06.280]  side effects of psychiatric drugs that's still a possibility but the evidence
[57:06.280 --> 57:10.480]  is pointing more and more toward a staged event we've got witnesses reporting
[57:10.480 --> 57:14.600]  multiple shooters and then a vehicle leaving the scene with those shooters
[57:14.600 --> 57:20.800]  we've got his background in the in the military in psychological operations a
[57:20.800 --> 57:25.320]  lot of that coming out now the caller on the line Mark from Texas are you still
[57:25.320 --> 57:33.080]  with us yeah okay any any further thoughts yeah but that was not in
[57:33.080 --> 57:36.800]  military intelligence okay but I did know people that have been were in the
[57:36.800 --> 57:40.520]  CID this criminal investigation division of the military police and
[57:40.520 --> 57:46.080]  intelligence that you say that would definitely a military had plans for some
[57:46.080 --> 57:51.040]  kind of a if anything broke out in civil society and a military would take
[57:51.040 --> 57:58.720]  control and I as far as the black ops is businesses this is just basically I'm
[57:58.720 --> 58:03.560]  using common sense every time something big happens it seems like it's an
[58:03.560 --> 58:08.240]  ex-marine like Lee Harvey Oswald who supposedly defected to the Soviet Union
[58:08.240 --> 58:12.880]  then came back nobody knew anything about the guy until he blows away to
[58:12.880 --> 58:16.120]  the United States nowhere that's that's where they're able to recruit people
[58:16.120 --> 58:20.960]  easily they look it's it's Jason Bourne are you ready to serve your country

[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:47.480]  data points not everything's confirmed yet we are exploring we are researching
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.720]  this is happening in real time so information is coming in we're going to
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.920]  try to connect the dots as best we can and I know also of course you can you

[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.360]  and Alex himself will be able to bring you more detailed breakdown of this
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:10.160]  entire event tomorrow as he returns to hosting the show but for today continuing
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.520]  here's what we've got coming up we're gonna go to we're gonna continue with
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:18.440]  callers who have information we've got Chris holding and Rick and TJ and Clark
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.120]  and others former and active law enforcement and some military we've
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:29.360]  also got breaking news about a another armed raid on a farmer in Canada this
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.080]  time he's going to join us for just a few minutes in the next hour he's been
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:40.320]  charged with 14 counts of conspiracy or wait a minute facing 14 years in prison
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:48.680]  based on the conspiracy charges against him for farming sheep yes farming raising
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.800]  sheep on a farm in Canada so the assault on farm freedom is continuing we've
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.840]  also got information about the deception of the Susan G. Coman
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.800]  organization has just been attacked in the British Medical Journal the BMJ two
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.400]  scientists have come out and accused Coman of running deceptive advertising
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:16.560]  that intentionally misleads women into getting mammograms that nine times out
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:22.440]  of ten actually harm those women so this is another assault we've got news
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.640]  about the Obama the Obama campaign website now selling hemp scarves on
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:33.520]  their website selling hemp products but the hemp is imported from China not the
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.040]  United States because it's still a criminal offense to farm hemp in the
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.480]  United States so why is the Obama administration or the Obama campaign
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.760]  marketing people why are they supporting communist Chinese jobs in China but not
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.600]  allowing American farmers to grow hemp right here in the USA also we've got
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:00.440]  breaking news about chemotherapy that's going to shock you just out yesterday it
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:06.520]  turns out that chemotherapy causes cancer yes chemotherapy causes cancer
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:11.880]  tumors to grow more aggressively it backfires this is shocking news out of
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:17.000]  the medical industry that chemotherapy backfires and causes more aggressive
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  cancer and it causes resistance to future chemotherapy so all of that is
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.920]  coming up plus we've got a video for you coming up in the third hour why doctors
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.200]  are more dangerous than guns and then getting back to the second amendment
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.160]  issue we're going to continue to break down the Sikh temple shooting and the
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:42.640]  assaults on the second amendment and the pattern of drills that always are found
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.800]  to be behind these shootings that have a specific agenda that always go after
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:52.520]  helpless groups of people Alex just said it on the phone in the last segment
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:58.920]  that they're going to go after people in malls in in churches in movie theaters
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:04.600]  in stadiums at sporting events this is where people are typically unarmed and
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:10.240]  easy to have shot in order to create mass casualties in order to create the
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:16.660]  reaction which is a nationwide call for gun control and a disarmament of the
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:21.880]  public but you know what think about it gun control is not gun control of
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.800]  everybody it's selective it's only about controlling or that is disarming guns
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.440]  from the citizens while concentrating power concentrating firearms in the in
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:34.720]  the hands of the government itself so while they're working to disarm the
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.280]  American public they're buying 450 million rounds of hollow point 40 caliber
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.200]  ammo they're buying hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ar-15
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:49.480]  rifles they're buying the 223 ammo that the 556 they are arming up while
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:54.160]  disarming us that's the real agenda so all of that straight ahead plus more

[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.720]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.040]  the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought

[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:17.600]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.160]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.240]  counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.360]  supply of foods for me foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients in
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.800]  increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time to get your
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.360]  supply I recently increased my supply for me foods direct because we've all

[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.880]  electrical power folks and what's been going on in this country I don't have
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.400]  to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is that's in the
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:17.240]  mainstream news every day millions of people have lost their power in the
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.280]  last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.760]  grid beyond its capacity I've always said that every family needs to be ready
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.960]  for blackouts and if you don't have a backup system in place I've got a great
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.840]  opportunity for you right now our good friends at Solutions from Science are
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:38.680]  offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit in fact I
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:42.760]  think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make it's literally thousands of
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:47.060]  dollars in savings remember these backup systems don't need gas because they're
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:51.440]  solar powered that means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise in full
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.760]  war listeners can get all the details at beat the blackouts.com that's beat

[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.160]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.880]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.800]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.680]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:22.640]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.920]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.520]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:36.720]  threatening the sale of nano-silver products you can now produce pure and
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:41.640]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.120]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go

[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:05.680]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.200]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:18.760]  continuing here on the Alex Jones show it's Monday August 6th 2012 this is Mike
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:24.120]  Adams the health ranger editor of natural news filling in for Alex today who
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.800]  is tuned in to everything that's going on he's doing research right now he's
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:33.760]  already posted a video on YouTube which we played earlier he's calling in he's
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.880]  texting in with additional information the crew here is hard at work again this
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:43.160]  is a coalescing a developing story we're collecting data points to try to
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:48.080]  connect the dots on what really happened with the Sikh temple shooting a lot of
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.800]  it already doesn't add up and lots of red flags that indicate this could be
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.760]  another piece of the pattern of staging false flag events for a particular
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:01.360]  political agenda I want to give you my own personal opinion on some of what's
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:08.200]  going on here first of all I am extremely saddened and extremely
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:16.200]  frustrated at the fact that that we have to interrupt our normal pursuit of
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.960]  happiness and pursuit of awakening and health information and all of these
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.320]  things to to deal with these staged events that government operatives or
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:32.120]  or dark evil groups within those agencies are perpetrating against the
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:37.720]  American people I I do not want to come on the air and talk about people being
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:43.920]  shot I cover it reluctantly because we have to we have to fight for our liberty
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:50.480]  which means we have to face reality but I would much rather be here teaching you
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.200]  about how to protect your vaccine rights how to say no to the vaccines how to
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.080]  say no to the fluoride how to protect yourself from the the evil death agenda
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.800]  of the cancer industry how to boost your your cognitive function and awaken
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.000]  your brain through nutrition and foods and all of these things that is what I
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.960]  am really about as the Health Ranger that's my specialty and that's what I'd
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.680]  rather be talking to you about but then at the same time I'm I'm an advocate of
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.800]  the Bill of Rights I'm an advocate of the Second Amendment I believe in the
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:27.000]  Bill of Rights I believe in the Constitution I am a hardcore libertarian
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.440]  constitutionalist who believes in the greatness of America and in our ability
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:37.800]  to overcome in any kind of challenges to to our freedom whether it be oppression
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:42.840]  or tyranny or these false flag agendas whatever the case may be we have to
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:49.240]  overcome that and so I think much like Alex we reluctantly cover these issues
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.840]  because if we don't we have no future think about it you know you can't just
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.200]  bury your head on your own house or land or your own farm you can't just bury
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.120]  your head in the sand and ignore all of this and hope it goes away it's not
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.600]  going away they are coming after us the clock is ticking if you're out there
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.840]  right now and you haven't purchased the firearm that you legally need to purchase
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.120]  to get squared away if you haven't purchased the ammunition that you need
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.800]  to protect your family and your community against whatever might happen down
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.680]  the road you need to get on it you need to get on the ball and take care of that
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:31.320]  right now and I bet you that gun sales to legal citizens are skyrocketing today
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.160]  once again and they doubled after the Aurora Colorado shooting a couple of
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.520]  weeks ago I bet they're doubling again today you know from normal levels not
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:43.600]  not doubling from the Aurora levels but but once again spiking up to that double
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.240]  level I bet they are and that's a smart thing to do because we are under attack
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.840]  our freedoms are under attack people remember this remember this that
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:12:00.680]  disarmament is the first step to mass murder every government in history that
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.040]  has committed genocide against the people that has committed mass murder has
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:10.120]  first sought to disarm the public why because they don't like people shooting
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:16.600]  back what tyrant wants to risk his troops getting shot at by an informed
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.160]  aware armed public they don't want to take that risk so they pass disarmament
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.160]  first just like they did in Australia a few years back and then the people are
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.280]  much easier to control but the bottom line is folks as as the health
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.680]  ranger I don't you know this this frustrates me to no end that we've got
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:39.840]  to deal with this but we do we have to deal with it I'd rather be talking to
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.360]  you about these other things to help awaken you to help nourish you to help
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.600]  your brain get off the psychiatric drugs get off the toxic chemicals get off
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.160]  the synthetic pesticides get back to basics self-sustainable living
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.040]  permaculture gardening raising your own food because that's where the minerals
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.560]  come from the soil and get embedded in your body's tissues so you can be
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.520]  healthy so you can operate with awareness and and stamina and a sense of
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:10.160]  of courage and and that be determined about moving forward to protect our
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.520]  future it comes from things like home gardening believe it or not sometimes
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:18.160]  gardening really is the answer and that's why that's under attack and we've
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.400]  got a story for you coming up shortly about the rancher in Canada who has
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.920]  been raided at gunpoint by Canadian law enforcement and is now facing 14 years in
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.200]  prison there for an alleged conspiracy and this is on top of all the raw milk
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.440]  assaults in the USA and we we I probably need to share with you some
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.000]  additional news on that as well you know what I'm just gonna go go ahead and
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.880]  share that with you right now briefly and then we're gonna go to more callers
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:48.080]  so Chris you're up next from the National Guard be ready but I spoke with
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.880]  James Stewart he called me from Ventura County jail over the weekend he is in
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:59.000]  jail he's the raw milk cow the raw milk man in California who has been just
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.400]  falsely accused of these financial crimes related to investors in a farm in
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.800]  Ventura and I can tell you right now those charges are utterly and completely
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:17.320]  fabricated and the agenda behind that is funded by the FDA the FDA is giving
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:22.680]  money to the states to assault raw milk farmers so at every level whether it's
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.240]  an attack on your farm whether it's an attack on your home garden as happened
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.640]  in with Julie Bass in Oak Park Michigan or the woman in Tulsa, Oklahoma
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.200]  whether it's an attack on your second amendment rights whether it's an attack
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.720]  on the water in your city through fluoridation which isn't even fluoride
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:42.520]  it's a it's a conglomeration a cocktail of toxic chemicals that dumb down your
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.240]  brain and actually give you cancer and some of those are even radioactive
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.440]  elements of the fluoride no matter what the assault they all have one thing in
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.640]  common it's about global control over you it's about controlling your food
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.760]  controlling your defense controlling your medicine controlling your money and
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.840]  your finances controlling your reproduction controlling your private
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.800]  property controlling your mind controlling what you think controlling the
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.480]  narrative controlling the stories that you believe to be true which is why
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:19.360]  they're repeated over and over and over again in the mainstream media and I'm
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.960]  sorry if I'm rushing through this it's just so much rushing through my my
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:27.960]  thought process that you need to understand and part of this is that if
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.600]  you really want to awaken folks you've got to you got to take care your brain
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.760]  your brain health you got to get off the chemotherapy you got to get off the
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.520]  fluoride you got to get off the psychiatric drugs and off the vaccines
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:44.120]  with the stealth cancer viruses in them your brain has to function well if you
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:49.040]  are going to stay awake and fight for liberty and freedom and restoring this
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:54.800]  republic the United States of America which we are losing by the day now it
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.760]  is slipping away from us so rapidly if I am concerned that we're going to be in
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:06.000]  in a martial law situation by early next year spring of 2013 if something
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.560]  doesn't change we're slipping into that realm very very quickly and it is it is
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.440]  scary that the public isn't awakened more about this I know that we in the
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:19.880]  liberty movement we are awakened but the public they are lagging behind so far
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.760]  and they're being swept into the false narrative through these stage shootings
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.960]  and through the mainstream media and their explanations which are almost
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:31.880]  universally false but the mainstream public is being swept into this and they
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.120]  can be dangerous when they're disinformed which is what they are
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.360]  because they can call for things such as disarmament that can put us all at
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.520]  risk so that's that's my two cents on this I want to go to Chris in California
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:50.920]  with the National Guard Chris you're on the air go ahead sir yeah hi yeah hi
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:57.640]  there you're on the air go ahead yeah I know the subject but I just want to make
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:05.280]  a few quick points on 2013 I have some friends who are active duty infantry
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:14.960]  men and in 2013 if you if you could go on Google all you have to do is type in US
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:24.160]  Army 1st Infantry 2013 Africa and it pretty much breaks down everything
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.200]  you know what's the what's the summary of it what are they talking about hit us
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:35.160]  with it well in 2013 Air National Guard Army National Guard Air Force
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:43.880]  Navy pretty much a whole military is going to go to Africa all right is it
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:51.360]  okay folks thank you for your call by the way I want to focus today on what's
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:55.280]  happening with the the seek temple shooting and people who have specific
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.440]  knowledge about that so I appreciate your call and that is an important piece
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.000]  of the puzzle but let's talk about what's happening right now today let's go
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.440]  to Rick and Virginia Navy veteran Rick you're on the air go ahead sir yeah
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:13.320]  thanks for taking my call I want to talk about his other than honorable
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:22.200]  discharge from misconduct my own personal experience was kind of weird in
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:32.440]  the sense that I joined the Navy during or joined the Navy in 2003 with F-14
[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:36.760]  Squadron so I was kind of the first couple years I was kind of involved in
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:42.400]  like the old-school type of military you know via Tomcats and then about midway
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.920]  through we decommed them and then we got the transition into the new Super Hornets
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:55.280]  with you know this kind of post-911 Navy and military and the type of atmosphere
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:02.960]  is night and day prime example E-45 back when I was under the Tomcat squadron
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.640]  you know they kind of had a beef with each other well what they did is a
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.960]  senior the senior supervisors just kind of built to them into a shop and said
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:19.080]  all right you guys got a you know beef with each other you know let's lock the

[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.520]  things what what does the E-4 designation really mean by the way it's
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:34.000]  third-class petty officer in the Navy it's the fourth fourth highest rank so
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.120]  you go in as a private E-1 and then you work up E-2 E-3 E-4 so it's kind of
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:46.200]  the lowest supervisor position and then the E-5 sergeant all right Rick we got

[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:35.920]  okay all right folks I'm mapping out I'm mapping out what I think is the
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:42.640]  agenda here this is consistent with what Alex Jones has been explaining I want
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:47.360]  to get an overhead cam shot for those watching on PrismPlanet.tv see if you
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.400]  can show this document let me get this other stuff out of the way all right
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.760]  right here yeah there we go so here's the deal here's how this works this is
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.280]  this is a deep plan that Alex has been explaining is in the minds of government
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.160]  first we start with stage shootings that's the false flag shootings that's
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:14.080]  Aurora Colorado that's what's happening today in Wisconsin at the Sikh temple or
[01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.240]  well yesterday this then leads to a disarmament mandate because in problem
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:26.200]  reaction solution hegelian dialectic right a very common common thing people
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:32.640]  call for getting rid of all the guns this then doesn't work because we've got
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:37.160]  lots and lots of people in America who will not give up their guns who know
[01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:44.600]  that giving up their second amendment is the path to slavery so we're going to
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:50.160]  end up with a shooting war or a civil war at that point now that's what the
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.160]  globalist want that's what they want because after that happens what what
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:03.880]  comes in is foreign troops to do the mop up right here the mop up operation
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:09.240]  foreign troop mop up operation after the people have shot it out with law
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:13.120]  enforcement or National Guard or whatever the case may be then the foreign
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.200]  troops come in and take over and after that mop up what do you end up with
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:26.720]  the which is the actual goal NATO UN control over everything that's the goal
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:32.600]  right there global government control in a disarmed nation that used to be called
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:38.440]  the republic the United States of America so do you see how this spiral of
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:44.480]  violence this spiral of destruction this the spiral of stripping away rights
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.460]  actually works it starts with the stage shootings and it ends up with government
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:55.720]  control over America which is then disarmed and now divided into FEMA
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:27:01.800]  regions the 10 FEMA regions with their own FEMA governors most of the population
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:10.080]  herded into the FEMA camps and there we go that's what we're headed towards so
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:17.160]  our goal here at info wars calm is to stop this process to reverse it to stop
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:22.560]  the violence to stop the stage shooting to stop the the government terrorism
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.320]  against the people to restore liberty to restore a peaceful society where power
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.240]  is distributed among the many you see this is a basic tenant of democracy if
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:37.520]  you concentrate power into the hands of the few you end up with a dictatorship
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:43.680]  you end up with communism or fascism depending on which which country it is
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:47.960]  and what their philosophies are but a concentration of power is always always
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:54.160]  always bad it is the distribution of power that leads to a free society the
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.080]  distribution of power that leads to just a just society that leads to a liberty
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.400]  that leads to innovation and a good economy and all of these things that
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.000]  make nations great so when you see calls for disarmament that is a
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  concentration of power into the hands of the few the corrupt the criminal
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.640]  elements of the government a true democracy democracy or a republic
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:22.000]  better yet must have firearms distributed into the hands of all of the
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.680]  people who obviously who don't have you know criminal histories or violent
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.280]  criminal histories or psychiatric problems but law-abiding citizens who
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.000]  are who are honorable who are peaceful who have good philosophies who are
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.320]  neighborly you know community-minded let's protect ourselves and our
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:41.120]  communities all of those people need to have firearms to have the distribution
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:45.760]  of power hence the second amendment that's what it's all about it's not
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.960]  about sports shooting it's not about hunting it's not about plinking at the
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.000]  local target range it is about having a distribution of power so that if a
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.120]  government goes bad and every government eventually goes bad that the people
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.600]  have the ability to stand their ground and demand their constitutional freedoms
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:09.720]  and their constitutional rights against the invasion of a corrupt criminal
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.400]  communist oriented government that is trying to kill them that's what the
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:18.480]  second amendment is all about now I know if you're a regular Alex Jones
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.360]  listener you already know that so I'm probably just telling you what you
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.080]  already know but a lot of people don't get this or they need to hear it again
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:29.880]  and so especially in the context of all these shootings taking place which look
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.840]  to be staged we need to educate each other about why the second amendment
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:39.720]  matters so much and why the the ownership of firearms by law-abiding
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:44.200]  citizens citizens is so crucial stay with us a lot more straight ahead here
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:50.200]  on the Alex Jones show we'll be right back with much more stay with us we're

[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:39.720]  everything in common and I was I was just talking with Rob Jacobson here
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:43.440]  during the break and he's got a theory that I think makes a lot of sense well
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:48.880]  I don't know if it's if it's he's not betting all his cards all his money on
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:55.040]  this theory but he's saying what if what if there were four shooters involved as
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.360]  witnesses already said what if the local police actually responded more quickly
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:06.520]  than they than was anticipated by the shooter team and that the police showed
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:13.400]  up and actually ended up shooting this guy what's his name again Wade Wade
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:19.040]  Michael what's his name what's his last name anyway the the shooter here in the
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:25.160]  at the Sikh temple what if they a page right Wade Michael page sorry that's
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.920]  it's an odd name you know it's it's it's like three anyway what if he was not
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.800]  supposed to get caught what if he was supposed to evacuate the scene with the
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:40.240]  other three shooters they were supposed to get away and this actually was a
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:47.320]  psychological operations mission that he was on you know just just like Jason
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.600]  Bourne right she dipped people that he really wasn't out of the army as is
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:57.400]  claimed that he was actually part of a special operations unit a Psyop unit took
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.240]  part in the shooting was supposed to get away but a a skilled local cop who
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.600]  actually has tactical training I read I mean above and beyond the normal tactical
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.920]  training that officers get this is I think what a 20-year veteran of the
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:16.600]  force there something like that he shows up shoots the guy dead before he can get
[01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:23.160]  away and so this guy Wade Michael Page wasn't supposed to get caught because
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:28.560]  his background is so obvious it's so obvious this is Psyop you know if he got
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.520]  caught it would just be too obvious for the public to know the truth that this
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.720]  is a psychological operation but he got shot and now his background comes out so
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:43.680]  once again the false flag starts to unravel they've messed it up they you
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:47.760]  know how many of these can they try to pull off and how many mistakes are they
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.680]  going to make as they keep getting sloppy you know maybe they just weren't
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:54.800]  counting on local cops showing up and and being competent as this officer was
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.160]  so this could be a case where we have that police officer to thank for
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:05.480]  actually killing one of the Psyop instigators the people carrying out the
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:09.960]  mission so that his background could be revealed but of course then they're
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:14.520]  going to just try to paint him as a white supremacist to to to eliminate any
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.880]  kind of talk that he might have been part of a Psyop anyway that's a working
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:22.240]  theory as everything is here today that's a working theory it's not
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:27.080]  necessarily true it's it's something that that we are discussing this is an
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:31.280]  investigation this is a dialogue so that's what we're doing right now let's
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:37.080]  continue that dialogue with our callers TJ in Minnesota a Navy a Navy and Army
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:42.920]  vet is on the air TJ go ahead sir yeah health ranger Mike are you there over I
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:49.440]  am right here 10 for go ahead go ahead what blast you and Alex Emory I'm gonna
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:55.360]  give four salient points here first of all last night George Norrie was busy on
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:00.800]  Mars or when he should have been talking to Alex Jones about walking yeah right
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:06.480]  that's right play secondly I'm I'm so military you wouldn't even understand it
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:12.880]  if we spent 10 days together at the campground we want to know if this guy
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:20.880]  was a specialist or an office there's a big difference and I love my officers
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:29.400]  and I still got a couple and thirdly when they choreograph news reports whether
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:38.880]  it's 9-11 or Waco or Oklahoma City it looks like a duck and it tastes like a
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:44.840]  duck and you don't have to second-guess your common sense health ranger that's
[01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:49.280]  right no it's all it all looks staged I mean it does it does look staged from
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.480]  the very get-go and then they just repeat the stage story over and over again
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:57.520]  but but you know TJ people buy into it why do people believe this so easily
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:04.160]  what do you think the enemy is a stupid fool the devil is a deceptive fool and
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:09.840]  he thinks everybody else is doing the devil has come to ground Mike he has
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:16.240]  come to ground out of the chemtrails and if if Alex Emory ain't on with George
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:23.320]  Norrie tonight I'll shut all my radio here's the deal Ranger Mike I want you
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:28.840]  to stay you're not military either but I'm so military you wouldn't even have
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:35.760]  a clue and I'm a defensive military constitutionalist and I'm looking at Jay
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.960]  Rutledge who signed the Constitution and that blood is running through my veins
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:48.760]  Mike yeah to this day and you can check it out I'm sure the government my big
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:54.280]  abomination brother has checked it out I can bring helicopter dinner any minute
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:39:01.320]  however we got to go to India India is important if you watch the Olympics and
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:09.880]  if you will recall and I hope you got some real sharp listeners God God you're
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:14.200]  doing good well thanks thank you TJ thank you TJ I appreciate your comments
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.480]  and your right India is a strategic of strategic importance there may be
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.720]  elements here of why a Sikh temple in particular was targeted of course with
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:29.440]  the the ties of the religion to many people in India today I'm not aware of
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:33.720]  any of any reason why that would be part of an agenda yet but something may come
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.760]  out but thank you for a call TJ very good points let's go to another caller
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.760]  Johnny in Pennsylvania with the Army National Guard Johnny go ahead you're
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:48.440]  on the air I'm like you're doing a fantastic job sitting in for Alex look real
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:53.800]  quick Mike I want to know why the Southern Poverty Law Center is being
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:58.280]  repeatedly referenced by media not just media but right wing media like the
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:04.440]  daily caller as an objective source giving us insight into what this guy was
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:08.640]  doing in that neo-nazi organization you know I got a theory on this that's a
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.720]  great question stay on the line I want to talk to you some more but the theory
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:17.520]  is that we are now seeing the division we're seeing people are lining up with
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.120]  their true alliances we are seeing on the conservative talk shows on
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:26.760]  conservative media we're now seeing many people selling out to the agenda of gun
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:31.520]  disarmament of gun control and they are you're right there some of them are
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:34.960]  quoting the Southern Poverty Law Center and sort of propping them up as a
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:40.160]  credible organization and that's bewildering but you're seeing it now
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:44.920]  you're gonna know whose side people are really on I'm on the side of liberty
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:49.400]  that's that's my position it sounds like yours what your thoughts go ahead
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:54.080]  absolutely Mike this is really concerns me and if I'm not mistaken Alex has
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.520]  shown the Southern Poverty Law Center to have colluded with government sources
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:05.480]  for this radical anti-freedom agenda and I'm not ready to say it's absolutely
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.520]  false flag but let me tell you something Mike this hits every single hot button
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:16.480]  talking point issue the guy's a veteran a skinhead a white racist FBI's got to
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:21.880]  step in and call it domestic terrorism now we're gonna be told I'm sure that he
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:27.800]  used an assault rifle with a an extra-large magazine right my take on
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:34.080]  this is if it really is either stage or provocateur the reason being is that
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.960]  they didn't get what they wanted out of Aurora they expected a lot of people to
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.440]  have a knee-jerk reaction and should be played the way they will play after
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.680]  Oklahoma City yeah they weren't people went out and they bought guns in rows
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:49.760]  and as a result they've had to step up their game and here's here's what's
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:53.800]  gonna be a problem for them if this is also stage if Aurora is stage and this
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.880]  is stage they're gonna be there's gonna be some issues because the more they
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:02.080]  stage these things the more they run the risk of having multiple operations
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:07.080]  where somebody on the inside is gonna come out it's gonna break links and come
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:11.840]  out and explain some of this and be a feel white hat as a work so I hope that
[01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:17.360]  happens absolutely they're stepping up their game and I'm just
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:24.800]  this I'm sorry myself Mike the reports that there were multiple
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.800]  shooters I believe one of the eyewitnesses said that there was there was
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:33.160]  gas released and oh yeah one more thing the fact that this guy is such an
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:39.160]  arch-typical white racist idiot he doesn't know that Sikhs aren't Muslims
[01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:44.760]  yeah it doesn't make any sense he's that stupid and yet he's that committed to go
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:48.400]  in and murder people and they let me see some of this other your other theory
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:53.200]  you were just putting out a few minutes ago this this officer was first on the
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:59.000]  scene that has this advanced tactical experience may have spoiled what happened
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.280]  and yes this guy was able to shoot him eight or nine times first yeah no kidding
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:09.000]  think about think about that right okay thank you thank you for your call Johnny
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.600]  no that's good you're I I totally agree with you they may that officer may have
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:19.400]  ruined the situation by showing up and shooting that one of the shooters weighed
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:25.560]  now this is just this is just coming in Washington Post is reporting the FBI has
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:29.760]  announced there's no reason to believe anyone other than the slain gunman was
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:37.320]  involved in the Sikh temple shooting associated press august 6 1039 a.m. now
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.000]  of course this is not unexpected the FBI no reason to believe anyone other
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.160]  anyone else is involved well hey what about the witnesses that said they saw
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:49.920]  four people and and people driving away in a car after they did the shooting
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.560]  what about those people is that not evidence but see this is the common
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:57.920]  pattern that we always see in these shootings it is it's it's so much easier
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.040]  to just blame it on a gunman especially if he's dead you know shoot one of the
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:06.800]  guys who was involved and then just blame it on him or if you can't blame it
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:11.080]  on him if the guy is still alive like James Holmes drug him into a state of
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.880]  mental oblivion which is what they're doing so he can't talk he can't say
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:20.080]  anything he doesn't even know who he is anymore he's obviously drugged up so
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:23.600]  they're either gonna kill him or they're gonna drug him and then their story
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.960]  doesn't have any loose ends right very very simple right that's what the FBI
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:33.720]  says right now oh so they're going with the the lone gunman theory now we're
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.240]  gonna go to one more call very quickly but Kurt Nemo has just posted a new
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:42.880]  article on info wars.com Sikh shooter a former Syop soldier linked to FBI's
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:49.200]  National Alliance this is live right now on info wars.com so go there and check
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:55.040]  this out and in this he details the links to the National Alliance and how
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:01.240]  the FBI admittedly ran the National Alliance white supremacist group so
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:08.960]  here we go yet another tie-in another another co-intel pro tie-in the FBI has
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:14.280]  run these white supremacist groups since the 1960s they subsidized armed
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:19.880]  directed and protected the Ku Klux Klan and other right-wing groups Brian Glick
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.120]  writes this is part of the story check that out at info wars.com right now just
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:28.280]  posted in the last few minutes by Kurt Nemo by the way you need to be

[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:38.320]  posted by Paul Joseph Watson and Kurt Nemo and no doubt others by Aaron Dykes
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:43.040]  will be in the works now we've had some great calls that I want to go to some
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.600]  more callers and get their thoughts on what's going on but again I want to
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:52.320]  caution listeners and viewers that this a lot of this is conjecture even on my
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:56.760]  part we don't know how the puzzle fits together yet we're exploring we're
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.720]  researching we're connecting the dots and we're highlighting some red flags or
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:05.360]  contradictions that appear in the official version of the story that's the
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:09.120]  stage we're in right now it's a little chaotic and it's fast moving and it will
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:13.360]  come together we'll coalesce let's say in more detail over the next 24 hours and
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.800]  Alex will be back here tomorrow to break it down for you in more detail but for
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:21.760]  right now let's go to Devin in Texas with the Marines Devin you're on the air
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:30.560]  go ahead sir. Hey how are you great show today so just a few points so I was in
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:36.720]  the military for 16 years I just got out in 2007 I was in since 1991 and in
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:41.520]  doing that in the I mean since 1996 a lot of these things that you guys were
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.440]  talking about I was seeing where we started sitting in on high level
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:49.400]  meetings where they were talking about crowd control with the military
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:54.520]  contingency plans for you know if the city's got out of control what the
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:47:00.080]  military was going to do and in coming into the wars in 2001 I sat in on high
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:05.280]  high level meetings as far as Iran was concerned they had contingency plans for
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:12.640]  Iran set up in 2002 so leading into to what has happened with the psychological
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:17.280]  warfare guys these great these guys are great scapegoats yeah these guys are
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:22.440]  great ways to forward these plans and I think what people don't see is that
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:27.680]  psychological operations is some of the best that the military has to offer and
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:33.920]  for one of these guys to choose number one to to go that road is a bit
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:38.360]  a devina this is good information to give us I'm gonna ask you to hold for hold
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:42.160]  that thought for just a second Alex is calling in with additional details right
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:48.440]  now is that correct guys okay Alex are you with us yes sir listen I want you
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:52.400]  to go back to the caller because I tried to call him between calls the hotline
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.560]  but I don't want to interrupt him but that's exactly the point I was trying
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:01.160]  to make earlier the psychological operations and he was mid-level just
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:05.200]  even get into it you gotta have an above average intelligence and understand
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.280]  complex multifaceted overlaying three-dimensional thought at least there's
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.120]  no way one of those guys is gonna go shoot up Sikhs who are known as being
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:18.320]  pro-US military and as they were saying with white premises as I heard a
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:22.360]  police officer earlier saying who really do his stuff they like the Sikhs
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.840]  because the whole history of it is a white ruling class of India they're
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:31.280]  like the vestigial leftovers of that so that's like deep psychology for the white
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:35.800]  supremacist that you know that the you know India was really white rule so
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:40.320]  that police officer earlier really do his stuff that's a point I didn't even
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.840]  make but here's the deal you've got the head you know the president of the
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.080]  church all saying there were all these weird guys around there you've got all
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:52.480]  this happening you've got the police scanners of four shooters a family
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.880]  saying four shooters the first witness saying four shooters you've got all this
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.400]  happening they're probably planning to kill everybody the guy was clearly
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.280]  steeped up we know McVay was in US military after he got out with a top
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:11.280]  level discharge we know that Elohim City had other special ops in it but but
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.160]  here's my final point and the point I haven't made you know when it's a
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:21.360]  scyop or if they provocateur or wound up a crazy you know it because the media
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:27.040]  instantly jump sorry they were saying white guy we have terrorist military
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.600]  it's the scripting it's like when they kill bright part within an hour and 45
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:34.520]  minutes they were saying natural causes natural causes the corner said I never
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:38.200]  said that it's when they are fixing the story it's like building seven when they
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:42.240]  blew it up an hour before on three channel the exact script it fell on its
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.960]  own footprint from fire just like they reported Lee Harvey Oswald had been
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:50.320]  captured an hour and a half before he just name was out and he had been
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:55.360]  captured you know you have to 12 hours difference Australia or whatever this is
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:01.560]  how this or whatever it is 18 hours this is how this stuff works okay and the
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:06.360]  point is it's the timing they got five bills while they were on the side of
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.640]  saying we don't want to restrict your guns it's a conspiracy theory they are
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:16.520]  running the other side of these events while the White House promised this was
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:20.800]  coming to its top donors saying don't worry we're buying the polls big stage
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:24.720]  stuff is coming I don't just look at something I say at stage I live this

[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:38.520]  supposed to have been caught and shot that he was just part of the team that
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:54.520]  was supposed to shoot and leave that's right we're going to a break call the

[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.880]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:20.280]  folks my gut tells me that this is just the beginning and it's it's this
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:24.320]  sickening feeling this this you know how you have you've got intuition you've
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:29.840]  got that gut feeling and and usually it's right and my guts telling me that
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:34.120]  this this is just the second shooting in many that they've got a whole series
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:40.880]  plan they've got a whole a network of you know psi-op terror cells that they're
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:46.840]  running to try to go after after the Second Amendment to disarm us to make
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:51.960]  us slaves in a total police state and I think it's gonna get worse I think
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:54.840]  they're gonna scale this up I think these shootings are just the beginning I
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:55:02.200]  hope I'm wrong I hope that covering this will stop them I hope that we maybe
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:07.760]  some some facts can come out about this particular shooter that will expose the
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:12.240]  false flag agenda behind all this so that we can stop it because I feel I've
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:16.280]  got a really bad feeling that we're gonna see a massive loss of life something
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:22.080]  much bigger in the next well let's say before the election before the voting
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:28.320]  day we're gonna see something big and I am I am mortified by that because you
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:32.840]  know one of my main missions is to protect life that's to protect innocent
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:37.920]  life especially but let's continue our caller Devin we cut you off there I
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:41.560]  apologize Devin you're we want to continue with you you're back on the
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:47.760]  air please pick it up where you left off before Alex called in no problem sir in
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:51.880]  doing three tours in Iraq one in Afghanistan I saw the latter parts of
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:56.120]  desert storms Somalia and Bosnia so I've been around the world a bit and I was
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:01.880]  always boots on the ground infantry we worked with SF we worked with recon we
[01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:07.040]  worked with all of the the guys that were doing things on the ground but when
[01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:11.360]  you look to psychological operations these guys are not meant for this type
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:19.280]  of operation this is not the way that they're even taught to use war to to use
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:23.520]  the human mind so there's nothing that would tell you that this particular guy
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:29.000]  would want to do this but is he a great scapegoat someone to put into that
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.640]  situation because they know that he's gonna be easy to kill if you put a you
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:38.720]  know a recon ranger tab sniper into that situation there's gonna be a lot of
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:43.000]  police-life law so that's the number one thing to look at is that's an
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.560]  interesting point but he was also apparently quite competent shooting
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:50.480]  back because he struck the the officer on the scene I think something like eight
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:53.920]  times I don't know the exact number but it seems like he at least was able to
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:59.120]  shoot back and and to do so quite competently are you saying that you
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.080]  know a recon operator would have been far far better skilled at that yeah what
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:09.320]  I'm saying is that you know every military personnel are skilled at shooting
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:13.520]  that's part of your boot camp that's part of your basic training but when you
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:19.440]  start talking about let's say recon you know Ranger tab sniper yeah there's only
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:23.640]  a hundred of you in the United States these guys are the elite of the elite
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:28.960]  and you know this is all they do SF they go through thousands of rounds of
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:33.360]  ammunition while they're training and they're doing live fire drills they are
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:37.120]  always going through buildings doing live fire drills with instructors
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:42.800]  standing in the room so you know so these guys are the top of the top do I
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:47.880]  think that a lot of you know a lot more life would have been lost had you have
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:52.440]  had somebody in there like that with it would you know what would have been a
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:57.520]  lot worse sure but when you start talking about this you know psychological
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:02.760]  operations and this what I was trying to reference to is that we sat into you
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:08.680]  know these high-level meetings where they were talking about you know going
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:13.080]  into war with Iran what it would have to be like to control the population 20
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:19.080]  seconds left going to stay on it I'm sorry time is limited go ahead yeah so
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:23.000]  anyway so what they were what they were willing to do to do that and I think that
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.960]  if you believe that this is not stage to try to take this further to take the
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:33.480]  second amendment right I mean what else could it be yeah good good points Devin

[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:25.960]  Austin Texas alex jones all right it's Mike Adams filling in for alex jones
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:30.360]  today thank you for continuing with us as we roll right into the third hour here
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:33.920]  we've already covered a lot of breaking news today about the Sikh temple
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:39.120]  shooting in Wisconsin and more details we've also had some interesting callers
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:43.480]  already give us some details again to just a quick overview this segment is
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:49.200]  not carried by all the AM stations out there quick overview their witnesses say
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:53.240]  there was a four-man team that conducted the shooting and then three out of those
[02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:58.560]  four men escaped in a vehicle one was shot that's the one we know now to be
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:05.800]  Wade Michael Page who is trained in at Fort Bragg in the psychological
[02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:11.720]  operations unit which automatically raises all kinds of question marks he's
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:15.960]  being the mainstream media is and and the FBI are running with the lone gunman
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:18.640]  story on this and they're trying to blame this guy's being a white
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:24.040]  supremacist but as we outlined earlier in the diagram that we showed on the air
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:27.800]  this is all really part of an agenda to get a reaction from the public to call
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:34.320]  for disarmament which will lead to a civil war which will then lead to widespread
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:39.240]  chaos and possibly death in America followed by foreign troops coming in
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:44.200]  mopping up the situation seizing control under the UN doctrine and remember
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:49.640]  the UN by the way does not have a second amendment the UN has has gives grants
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:55.680]  it grants money the right word you in such such oh man such an evil malicious
[02:01:55.680 --> 02:02:02.160]  organization they do not claim that any individual has any right to any self
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:06.200]  defense or protection or anything like that they only claim that states have
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:10.560]  the right to to defend themselves and that all government should have all
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:15.840]  power a so-called monopoly of force a monopoly of power in the hands of the
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:20.080]  government that's what the UN stands for so this is all unfolding right now and
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:26.240]  the consensus among those of us who are steeped in this information who do this
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:30.800]  every day is that this is just the beginning that there's a pattern that's
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:36.480]  unveiling here and that attacks could get much worse in the weeks and months
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.200]  ahead and sadly we have to acknowledge that reality because we want to stop it
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:45.520]  we don't want to see innocent loss of life we don't want to see people dying
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:51.800]  to serve this globalist agenda now in this segment here I want to share with
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:55.840]  you something else on a different topic you know how raw milk is under attack in
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:01.560]  America and in California for example they conducted armed raids on the raw
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:07.040]  milk distribution center known as raw some foods well it turns out that in
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:12.400]  European countries they have on street corners raw milk vending machines in
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:15.560]  fact we've got some pictures that were showing you for those of you watching
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:22.480]  on prisonplanet.tv raw milk vending machines now imagine America our
[02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:30.600]  vending machines churn out aspartame diet soda msg laced snack chips and other
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.000]  toxic foods with chemical additives that cause cancer and diabetes and heart
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.880]  disease and dementia and dumb down your brain and make you a victim of the
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:43.920]  medical enslavement system that's what our vending machines churn out in
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:49.200]  America but in Europe they have raw milk vending machines here's one called the
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:55.960]  melecomat melecomat that's that means like automatic milk melecomat and by the
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:00.400]  way if it's perfectly safe nobody's dropping dead across Europe from getting
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:04.360]  raw milk from a vending machine it turns out there are temperature sensors in
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:09.320]  these machines and when the temperature drops below or goes above let's say the
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:12.800]  refrigeration level it is supposed to be at then the machine just stops selling
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:18.200]  the milk so nobody buys spoiled milk nobody gets harmed by the probiotics the
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:22.360]  friendly bacteria that's in the milk it's all perfectly normal and natural but
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:27.400]  in America what do we do oh we criminalize raw milk and we have toxic
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:32.720]  poison vending machines known as junk food and diet soda and processed dead
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:37.640]  factory food that's what we serve in America I say let's replace the junk
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:40.880]  food machines with raw milk vending machines all across America how about
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:46.920]  fresh fruit and raw milk vending machines superfood vending machines smoothies
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:51.200]  in a vending machine for America put those in the public schools and you'll
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:55.880]  see a revolution of health and abundance and wellness and clear thinking at the
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:59.560]  same time that's why they don't want those in America stay with us we'll be

[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:22.040]  all right we're back on the Alex Jones show thank you for listening in this is
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:26.600]  Mike Adams the health ranger editor of naturalnews.com filling in for Alex
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:31.160]  today Alex we back tomorrow and so far we've been breaking down the details of
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:38.120]  the Sikh temple shooting in in Wisconsin this is yet another data point on the
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:43.160]  pattern of false flag events that are being staged in order to take away our
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:49.000]  liberties and rights as the public reacts to the false narrative stories being
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.760]  pushed out there about these events now I know we've got callers on the line I
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:57.800]  have to apologize to you we're gonna we're gonna put you on hold for now we've
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:03.120]  got a guest joining us right now with some breaking news about the Canadian
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:09.560]  food inspection agency the CFIA conducting an armed raid on an Ontario
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:15.160]  farmer named Michael Schmidt and this raid happened last week and this farmer
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:17.760]  and by the way the reason we're covering the story is because this is yet
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:22.840]  another data point on the pattern of of criminalizing farming in North America
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:28.440]  it's not just America it's Canada as well and Michael Schmidt whose farm was
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:35.040]  raided by 20 officers is now facing and it was an eight-hour long raid he is
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:41.580]  now facing 14 years in prison for so-called conspiracy charges and he
[02:09:41.580 --> 02:09:46.000]  joins us now by phone to help explain what is going on with the armed raids
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:51.640]  on farms in Canada Michael welcome to the show you're on the air with Mike Adams
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:57.120]  here how you doing hi Mike good afternoon good afternoon to you too sir
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:02.760]  please tell us what went down what's going on why did they target your farm I
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:09.920]  think this is just part of a much bigger picture here the story goes goes back a
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:16.040]  little bit and I think you probably remember also the the the pig slaughtering policy
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:22.000]  in Michigan sure yeah the DNA manate heritage pig so it kind of a genetic
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.560]  profiling now we had a case here where there were rare sheep there was less than
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:36.240]  hundred left in in Canada at the Shropshire sheep a very valuable heritage
[02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:42.240]  breed and a farmer and her name is Montana Jones has been fighting for
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.400]  years and years with the DFI a because they say they found scrappy at the
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:56.800]  wasting disease which is not affecting human health at all has been found in
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:01.960]  an animal which supposed to come from her farm two years after she sold it she
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:08.640]  is disputing that however the policy is kill and shoot first and then ask
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:16.000]  questions later so what what they decided is to eliminate her entire herd to kill
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.400]  to kill her entire herd because they said we need to humanely
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:29.000]  humanize these sheep in order to prove that they're healthy now how how get
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:34.320]  to frantic is that approach well I mean the government has gone insane so it
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:37.880]  sounds like bar for the course for government today it's just I think a
[02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:42.000]  lot of people are shocked that this is happening in Canada as well yes so the
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.280]  story goes further when they were slated for slaughter yeah the sheep suddenly
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:53.320]  disappeared they went on a lamb and there was a note found in the barn that
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:59.080]  the farmers Peace Corps has taken the sheep into custody protective custody
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:05.240]  until the government has conclusive proof that they are infected with scrappy
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:11.400]  or an alternative to killing has been found so they were in essence rescued by
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:16.760]  the farmers core yeah which said we have the sheep and we're not letting you have
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.600]  them until you prove that they actually have this so-called disease that that
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:25.680]  you're claiming correct exactly so what the government did is instead of getting
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:35.120]  into a dialogue they the release a whole army of investigators and probably spent
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:40.440]  millions of dollars to find those who are part of that farmers Peace Corps who
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:45.680]  rescued the sheep and then you posted some kind of a comment that just supported
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:53.080]  their actions is that what I was very very supportive prior to that already
[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:57.840]  because I followed that struggle of Montana Jones yeah in regards to trying
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:02.040]  to get into you know to find an alternative to that whole situation and
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:08.360]  the EFI says no they but they will be killed and then the sheep disappeared and
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:14.200]  then I think three months later three months later they were found they got
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:20.480]  all killed and all sheep proved to be healthy wow there's no disease yeah with
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:25.840]  no disease I posted then a video statement on behalf of the Farmer's Peace
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:32.600]  Corps as a liaison for the Farmer's Peace Corps stating that I'm that I'm
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:38.080]  basically coming out on behalf of the Farmer's Peace Corps in order to explain
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:46.240]  the situation that the same policy had been implemented about 60 70 years ago
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:55.040]  in in Germany on humans we are on the same path again doing a genetic
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:01.000]  profiling and who says that it stops with sheep first of all be okay I'm
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  I'm potentially will be charged with conspiracy because I am supposed to be
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:12.200]  part of it charged with conspiracy criminal conspiracy the interesting
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:18.080]  question which needs to be asked who is conspiring here do we have a government
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:25.000]  who is conspiring to destroy the genetic diversity in our gene pool and just
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:31.120]  streamlined everything to their liking based on economic principles oh wow so
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:34.960]  this this is huge is so much here okay we've got the government doing this
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:40.600]  genetic cleansing of the sheep and and as you said maybe it doesn't stop with
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:44.920]  sheep I say half the public's already sheep anyway so they're they're probably
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:48.880]  next in line you know I mean obviously not physically sheep but mentally
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.120]  there's a cheap mentality right so so then you you they're attacking your
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:57.480]  free speech rights because you came out and said it reminds you of the history
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:01.160]  of Germany with the ethnic cleansing there and then they charge you with
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:07.720]  conspiracy to prevent the government from slaughtering slash murdering the
[02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:12.160]  sheep that were the private property of this other woman Montana Jones exactly
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:16.400]  when then what I did is when I sat down with the investigators I said you know
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:21.440]  what the interesting thing is we could resolve that quite nicely where we find
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:26.160]  like they do it in England they have an exemption for rare breed that they will
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:29.840]  not be slaughtered there will be kind of a quarantine program where they can
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:35.000]  continue their breeding if they can sit down and figure that it is much cheaper
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.840]  for the government than trying to hunt everybody down involved in the in their
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:42.280]  sheep eyes oh but they'd love to hunt everybody down that's the new government
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:47.040]  that's the new tyranny government announces that you're the enemy yeah you
[02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.920]  the farmer you the the guy who wears a John Deere hat you the veteran you the
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:56.160]  patriot you're the new enemy they want to hunt you down they want to charge you
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:59.080]  with conspiracy they want to throw you in jail they don't want you to have the
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:03.760]  right to farm and have a diversity of animals that would be freedom exactly
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:08.720]  and that is and the other thing I said about you know what I'm actually not
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:14.040]  afraid if you drag me into court because now things that should actually be a
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:19.320]  public debate or a debate in parliament is moving into the courtroom because
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:25.160]  otherwise it will never be exposed what the policies are from the government
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:29.400]  because nobody knows the newspapers don't report it properly and so it might
[02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:36.120]  as well go on record in the courtroom and it's painful but is a necessary step
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:40.400]  you have to take the need to drag these things into the court in order that the
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:50.000]  public knows who is actually the real is the one who is conspiring again what we
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.840]  need to do in preserving our rights and diversity yeah yeah well said Michael
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:57.080]  by the way let me give out a web address here for people who want to learn
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:02.680]  more it's farmfoodfreedom.org farmfoodfreedom.org is there another
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:06.520]  website Michael that you want to give out and then you can go to another website
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:14.480]  which is which is always up to date is the completepatient.com sure the
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:20.280]  completepatient.com is also Weston a price.org exactly then I think it's
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:24.960]  everywhere right now you know it everybody covers the story okay so so
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:29.520]  here's the thing then so governments now in the US and Canada believe that they
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:33.720]  have the right to just go out and slaughter animals or demand they be
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:37.400]  killed mass mass killed in fact there's another case wasn't this covered by
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:43.080]  Christy Canty in the her film farmageddon exactly in the United States
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:46.320]  can you give our listeners a brief background of that because that I don't
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:51.840]  remember all the details there there was this case of Linda and I don't know
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:56.000]  exactly the details but there was exactly the same thing happening they
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:01.120]  were slotting all the sheep based on false assumptions and then it came out
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:05.480]  and there I think if you if you take a little bit deeper in the story you know
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:10.080]  more details about it but then it came out that it was simply an internal thing
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:15.440]  in order to finance an institute and they needed a justification for this for
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:22.680]  the Institute by slaughtering and testing these animals so yeah when you
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:28.520]  really look deeper into that how much corruption is connected to all these
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:33.040]  regulations which are imposed and then you find out well everybody is lining
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:37.800]  the pocket bureaucrats lining the pockets with all these programs with a
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:45.400]  total neglect for what we what what we need for our survival on this planet and
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:52.480]  that means biodiversity absolutely by GMO the same agency which destroys our
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:58.640]  genetic pool is the one which approves GMO and it doesn't give the people the
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:03.240]  right even to know what they eating no it's it's insane Michael it's out of
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:07.680]  control it's a world gone mad they're destroying the the the animals they're
[02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:10.560]  destroying the crops they're destroying the seeds they're destroying the soil
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.560]  they're destroying the minds of the people they're destroying our future it
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:19.400]  it is a world gone mad and that film by the way pharma getting that that does
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:23.680]  expose some of that is available at the info wars store which I believe is just
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:28.920]  info wars store.com or just go to info wars.com Michael I'm about to wrap up
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:33.600]  the segment with you any final thoughts before we let you go there well the
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:38.560]  final thought I have is unless we prepare to suffer ourselves or sacrifice you
[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:43.360]  know our own freedom we will never win this battle and people need to understand
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:51.080]  that that complacency and fear is not any more other place where we are right
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:55.280]  now that's right to step forward well said Michael Michael Schmidt thank you
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:58.720]  for joining us today on the Alex Jones show stay with us a lot more straight
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:03.560]  ahead we'll be right back the worst drought in 50 years continues and the
[02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:07.920]  first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the
[02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:11.480]  Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but soy
[02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:16.160]  alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to
[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:19.600]  feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:23.520]  your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:27.720]  cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:31.400]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise

[02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:08.280]  seconds could get me in a lot of trouble I just created a free video
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:13.720]  presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and
[02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:17.840]  government agencies for what they really are incompetent line crooks that are
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:21.800]  counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:26.560]  some have called this a conspiracy others have called it a cover-up and you
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:33.000]  will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes my video at 123coverup.com
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.960]  exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:41.000]  can beat them to watch the controversial video the thousands of other
[02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.920]  smart patriots have already seen in the last three months go to 123coverup.com
[02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:50.840]  and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home go
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:55.960]  watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down
[02:23:55.960 --> 02:24:00.720]  again that's 123coverup.com
[02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:22.840]  above all remember on this no matter how many of these shootings they stage if
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:28.720]  you really look at the statistics your chance of being harmed in a random
[02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:33.080]  shooting event or even a staged a shooting event your odds are so slim
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.720]  they're almost zero and to help emphasize that I've put together a video
[02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:41.440]  Alex mentioned it last week but I think I'm gonna play it in the next 30 minutes
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:46.080]  it's pretty short it's about six minutes why doctors are more dangerous than
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:50.520]  guns and this is using the government's own statistics combined with statistics
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:54.600]  from the Journal of the American Medical Association when you combine those two it
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:59.320]  shows that doctors well it shows that you are sixty two hundred percent more
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:04.680]  likely to be killed by your doctor inadvertently then killed by a
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:10.040]  homicidal shooter so hey maybe we should be talking about doctor control instead
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:13.880]  of gun control right now oh and by the way when doctors kill you they don't
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:18.280]  even get arrested they don't go to jail they don't nobody stops them they're
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:22.760]  free to go on killing other patients and getting more kickbacks from more drug
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:28.360]  companies at the same time so it's like they get paid to kill people it's like
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:32.480]  they're inadvertent hit men running around the country racking up a body
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:37.200]  count as long as big pharma keeps raking in the profits so that video coming up
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:40.480]  right here in the next 30 minutes or so I want to get back to some of the
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:45.560]  callers that are on hold so thank you for holding as we covered that armed raid
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:51.520]  in Canada on farmer Michael Schmidt there being charged with conspiracy for
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:56.520]  speaking up about government genocide against animals there what a weird
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:00.560]  bizarre situation but Antoine from Florida is on the phone with us says
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:03.840]  Orlando police Antoine you've been listening in what are your thoughts on
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:11.320]  all this this is obviously stage and it's a lot of crazy stuff that goes here
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:16.160]  Orlando like they don't want they don't want people feeding the homeless here you
[02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:19.240]  know we're supposed to write them tickets I mean I don't but you know some
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:24.680]  people do but um there's a there's one angle that I wanted to tell you guys I
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:29.240]  think black people don't see because they attack this or I can't pronounce the
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:34.040]  name and obviously they're not Muslims but Michelle Bachman and a couple of
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:38.600]  Republicans were accusing a lot of people of being Muslim sympathizers or a
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:43.540]  part of the Muslim brotherhood could this possibly a purpose to tackle on a
[02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:51.920]  fake people just to make those guys look bad well I mean you know by large
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:56.360]  Americans don't really have much knowledge about these different religions
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:02.840]  you know that Sikhism is a monotheistic religion you know they have the head
[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:07.680]  where that but I mean there are some people you know who just aren't really
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:11.520]  informed who think that anybody who wears something on their head that
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:16.960]  doesn't look like a common thing must be a Muslim or something I mean but it's
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:22.120]  but it's crazy that the Sikh religion has nothing they don't preach violence at
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:24.920]  all in fact they practice meditation and prayer there are some people in the
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:29.600]  natural health movement who are Sikh followers who practice meditation so I
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:34.080]  don't know your guess is as good as as good as mine on that one do you have
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:39.640]  any other thoughts on this issue yeah I also have one solution I wanted to put
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:43.920]  on there because obviously this is trying to use because I guess the Batman
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:47.960]  massacre didn't work for gun control right I think we should do every second
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:52.200]  of the month to buy guns but I mean if it's a little handgun just some box is
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:56.880]  showing that we're not going to give up our right to bear arms I agree with you
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:01.840]  man I agree you know people lined up to buy Chick-fil-A in in protest of that
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:05.600]  situation I think people should be lining up at you know legal legal
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:10.200]  citizens with no criminal records should be lining up to legally acquire firearms
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:14.480]  for self-defense that would be a great anti boycott a great way to support the
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:18.960]  industry and tell the government that their their little plot didn't work but
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:24.120]  by the way Antoine and your comments are right on you nailed it if if the
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:28.000]  government doesn't get its way they're gonna they're gonna up the game they're
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:32.640]  gonna go to the next level of terror which is as Alex mentioned you know
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:37.120]  hour and a half ago here on the show possibly targeting a government building
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:41.680]  for blowing it up it's basically an Oklahoma City type of situation once
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:46.440]  again and by the way you got to get that film a noble lie and I believe that's
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:49.760]  available in the Info War store as well because that is more relevant now than
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:53.240]  ever before and I I think there's a very good chance that we could see a
[02:28:53.240 --> 02:28:57.480]  government building targeted before you know before the election and you know
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:02.200]  sadly again we want to stop this kind of thing from happening these things work
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.400]  against liberty they work against freedom we don't want to see that
[02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:09.640]  happening so people be on the lookout hey let's take a page out of the DHS
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:14.080]  manual if you see something say something if you see drills taking place
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:19.560]  you send a tip to Info Wars and what is that show tips at info wars.com right
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:23.120]  that's the email address if you see something fishing going on say
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:28.440]  something online make a video post it on YouTube start a blog call into the
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:32.760]  Alex Jones show send us tips over at natural news sometimes we cover things
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:36.320]  that info wars can't get to because they're so busy covering other things
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:41.600]  if you see something fishy that the government is doing you say something we
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:45.120]  can use this against them we can use it in defense of liberty that's what we
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:49.560]  have to do if we want to protect and defend that liberty stay with us a lot

[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:33.200]  the time clock is counting down toward craziness that's for sure good good
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:37.120]  music choice there time slipping away for you to get your liberty squared away
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:43.400]  whether you are standing up for your second amendment rights or standing up

[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:53.240]  in America what was once called the land of the free time is slipping away on
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:58.640]  all of those issues so you better stand up now this is not a spectator sport
[02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:02.520]  folks I know some of you out there you listen to this show as a form of
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:07.840]  entertainment I'm guilty of that too sometimes I listen and I'm just you know
[02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:11.360]  I'm just amazed at what's going on and it's you know it's fun to listen to how
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:15.600]  crazy things get sometimes but you know that's a pretty short-lived little ride
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:18.440]  you better get on board and actually do something you better get out on the
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:23.960]  street and hold some signs up you better call your congressman you better you
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:28.680]  know start a blog post a video talk to your friends and neighbors show videos
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:32.720]  have a have a showing of a noble lie in your living room have a screening in
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:36.840]  your home invite your friends over let them see the truth too you better get
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:41.160]  on board with that because time is slipping away very very quickly now
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:48.280]  along those lines I I think it's crucial also not just to go out and and you know
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:52.320]  a lot of people buying firearms and buying ammo and that's you know that's
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:56.640]  great but you better get some skills all of you law-abiding people out there who
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:00.720]  want to have a safe community who want to have a safe household keep your
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:06.480]  family safe be part of keeping peace if looting begins if law enforcement or
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:10.200]  peace officers are not able to do their jobs because they're already stretched
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:14.080]  pretty thin and if something chaotic happens it's going to get bad they're
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:17.880]  going to need your help so you better get some skills I want to plug this site
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:25.560]  make ready dot TV get out to make ready dot TV panteo productions that they've
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:30.120]  produced a whole series of videos there I'm not affiliated with them I'm just
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:34.720]  saying they teach you some skills Paul how and a bunch of others out there who
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:38.920]  would teach you firearms skills how to be competent get out there check that out
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.440]  and make ready TV I don't know why they're not a sponsor here they should
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:47.320]  sponsor this show that'd be a good fit next thing is the big fluoride lie
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:51.480]  check this out we we covered this on natural news this is something you got
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:55.880]  to know they're now attacking bottled water they're saying spring water yeah
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:01.760]  like natural spring water they say harms your teeth you know what their logic is
[02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:10.200]  oh it doesn't contain fluoride therefore therefore if you drink spring water or
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:13.480]  if you drink filtered water if you drink pure water they say it might harm your
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:18.520]  teeth this is nonsense this is it's a complete lie it's a total fabrication by
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:24.040]  the poison pushing fluoride pimps who are just trying to poison everybody total
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:28.120]  nonsense they want to add see here's you want to know the real agenda here's
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:31.880]  what's happening they know that people are avoiding fluoride in the tap water
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:36.280]  and they're buying bottled water and they're filtering out the fluoride with
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:40.160]  the fluoride filters that are available for example on the propure system that
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:45.160]  infowars sells people are avoiding the fluoride and they're waking up and
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:51.000]  because they're waking up the controllers realize they have to keep
[02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:55.640]  everybody suppressed so you better put fluoride into all the bottled water
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.760]  well how do you do that you make people afraid of fluoride free bottled water
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:06.920]  and that's the agenda that's what we're seeing now and that story was run all
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:12.120]  over the mainstream media in fact that that story attacking clean bottled
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:19.320]  water was run on us news and world report i village calm it was run by health day
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:25.360]  which is a news service like a wire service it was run on fizz.org it was
[02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:30.400]  run on health 24.com and a bunch of other websites that were just pushing this
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:35.560]  total disinformation about bottled water they look they want to poison you
[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:40.920]  through every method imaginable and more along those lines we've got a breaking
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:46.920]  story I just published it late late last night about Susan B. Coleman
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:51.960]  Susan G. Coleman sorry about that Susan Coleman the Coleman for the cure
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:59.000]  organization has been now exposed for their they've been caught in a mammography
[02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:05.880]  propaganda fraud scientists published in the British medical journal the BMJ have
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:12.480]  now exposed the lies and deceptions of the Coleman for the cure group which is
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:17.040]  using this fear campaign in false advertising and the British medical
[02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:21.080]  journal has the graphic that shows the false advertising they're using a fear
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:27.280]  campaign to recruit women into getting mammograms why mammograms because and
[02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:31.320]  there's there is on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers that's the graphic
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:36.200]  from the British medical journal I actually paid the money to go get this
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:43.680]  article from the BMJ and it turns out that Coleman group is lying to you about
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:51.960]  all of this it turns out that the actual risk of a 40 or I'm sorry of a yeah 40
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:55.880]  year old woman getting cancer in the next 10 years getting breast cancer is
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:39:03.240]  only 0.53% and even if you believe all the best mammography numbers if they get
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:09.560]  mammograms every year that risk only goes down to 0.46% so we're talking about
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:15.000]  an improvement of only seven women out of 10,000 and that's if you believe their
[02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:22.720]  numbers so mammography might only help seven women out of 10,000 meanwhile it's
[02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:26.840]  harming 9 out of 10 women who actually get mammograms so they're getting false
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:31.760]  diagnosis and this was pointed out by the authors of this story and we can
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:36.680]  actually quote from them in a in a set in another segment the authors will ocean
[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:40.880]  and shorts those are the scientists who who wrote this article say that more
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:46.720]  women are harmed by mammograms then are possibly helped by them that the
[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:50.840]  benefits are dubious and that the Coleman group is just completely
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:55.560]  exaggerating the benefits the so-called benefits of mammograms in order to pursue
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:40:00.360]  their agenda well what is their agenda think about this it's all pink washing
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:05.800]  you know instead of actually teaching women how to prevent cancer with vitamin
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:10.760]  D with trace minerals like selenium for example and magnesium and things like
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:17.720]  that they wait for women to get cancer and then they push women into chemotherapy
[02:40:17.720 --> 02:40:22.400]  treatments and they push women to get more mammograms meanwhile the Coleman
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:27.680]  group is getting money from guess who the mammogram manufacturers and they own
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:31.880]  stock and companies like GE that manufactures the mammograms and they get
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:35.560]  money and they do matching grants from companies that that are pharmaceutical
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:40.640]  companies that make money off of the chemical cocktails which are chemotherapy
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:47.840]  so it turns out that mammography is largely a hoax it doesn't save lives
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:52.720]  early detection doesn't save lives that has been expressed by these scientists
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:58.360]  in the British Medical Journal it's really just a a numbers trick and we've
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:03.920]  exposed that in a story total fraud it is time to boycott everything that is
[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:10.440]  attached to a pink ribbon so if you run for a cure you are being conned if you
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:14.920]  give money to any run for the cure you've been conned that money doesn't go to
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:20.280]  help women prevent breast cancer not at all the whole thing is a scam now the
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:24.120]  fraud is being exposed even in the conventional medical industry think about
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:27.800]  it the British Medical Journal which is funded by drug company advertisements
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:32.760]  even ran this article attacking the Coleman deceptions and the false
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:37.120]  fraudulent propaganda in the ads think about it the British Medical Journal
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:44.600]  that is a it is an institution almost of the medical industry that is well
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:48.800]  respected excuse me and they would run this and they would go after Coleman
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:52.640]  really that's how bad it's gotten that even the people in the industry can't
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:57.080]  deal with it anymore they have to tell the truth so kudos to Wolosha and
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:00.720]  Schwartz for being willing to step out there and actually tell the truth but
[02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:04.560]  here's there's more to the story what happens when you get chemotherapy this
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:08.520]  is breaking news right now and I'm writing an article on this tonight so
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:12.040]  you'll see this tomorrow on natural news yes I'm actually reading you tomorrow's
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:19.960]  news today so the story is it's a shock cancer finding the chemotherapy causes
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:26.640]  healthy cells to grow cancer tumors to to actually it works like this when
[02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:31.840]  healthy cells are exposed to chemotherapy they emit a protein the protein is
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:35.440]  called WNT 16b the name doesn't matter don't worry about the name it's a
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:39.600]  protein that has been taken up by the cancer cells cancer tumors growing
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:47.280]  nearby causes those tumors to quote grow invade and resist subsequent therapy
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:50.920]  and that's from Peter Nelson of the Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center in
[02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:55.400]  Seattle he's the co-author of a study that documents this phenomenon which has
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:00.520]  been published in the journal Nature Medicine it turns out chemotherapy is a
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:07.240]  fraud it backfires chemotherapy causes cancer tumors to grow so at first it
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:11.800]  shrinks the tumors and then when the chemotherapy stops that patient
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:16.320]  aggressively grows more tumors more quickly which is why cancer always
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:21.600]  comes back if you go get chemotherapy it always comes back and meanwhile you're
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:24.480]  being killed by the chemicals your hair is falling out you're vomiting you're
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:27.680]  losing muscle mass you're losing your appetite you're being starved to death
[02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:31.480]  you look like a concentration camp victim because you got the chemotherapy
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:35.240]  and why did you get the chemotherapy in the first place because the Coman group
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:40.760]  did a mammogram and through false advertising to convince you to get a
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:44.640]  mammogram and then you had a false diagnosis of a breast cancer tumor and
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:50.320]  then you said yes to the oncologist that makes money off of selling you the
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:55.240]  very chemotherapy chemicals that we now know backfire and cause cancer tumors
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:44:00.400]  to grow more aggressively the whole thing is a malicious crime against women
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:04.720]  it's not just women you know men are caught up in all this with prostate
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:08.600]  cancer but it is especially targeting women and more importantly for all of
[02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:12.400]  you out there who are listening who have let's say darker skin color your
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:16.200]  African-Americans out there you're being targeted you're being victimized by this
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:20.880]  because guess where Coman takes their little mobile mammography vans into low
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:26.240]  income neighborhoods targeting low-income women who they know have more
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:31.800]  aggressive breast cancer tumors because vitamin D deficiency is epidemic
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:35.880]  across the African-American community because the dark skin color blocks the
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:40.000]  ultraviolet light from the sunlight if you get sunlight you generate vitamin D
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.440]  so you can actually prevent cancer in your own body cancer tumors don't grow
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:48.080]  in the presence of high levels of vitamin D circulating in your body not
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:51.960]  unless you're exposed to high levels of radiation or a really toxic chemical for
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:57.280]  example so the Coman group goes into the black neighborhoods and and irradiates
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:01.760]  the breasts of those women knowing that it's going to produce revenues for the
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:05.880]  drug companies and revenues for the mammogram companies and it's going to
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:09.320]  give them more power so everybody can run around running for a cure pink
[02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:12.840]  washing pink washing and then the battery companies sell their products with
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:16.360]  little pink ribbons on them and then the cosmetic companies that have their toxic
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:21.360]  cancer causing chemicals can sell you their little pink ribbon cosmetics yeah
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:26.080]  hey why not have a pink ribbon cigarette you know a brand of like Coman
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:30.600]  smokes pink ribbon cigarettes yeah every with every breath you're helping to find
[02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:33.840]  a cure for the cancer that you're getting by using our product that's what
[02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:38.680]  the slogan should be I mean that's how crazy this is look you think about
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:43.560]  everything that's going on today whether it's the the cancer industry scam
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:47.240]  whether it's the stage shootings that we're seeing with the Sikh temple in
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:51.280]  Wisconsin with Aurora Colorado with the attacks the assaults on farmers in
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:56.520]  Canada and in the United States on raw milk on a home gardens on your your
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:59.760]  free speech rights are under attack you're being surveilled by smart grid
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:02.720]  technology pretty soon when all those are installed they're going to be able to
[02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:06.080]  turn off your television if they if they want you to they're going to be able to
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:10.320]  turn off your AC kill huge numbers of people during a heat wave in Chicago one
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:13.560]  summer for example just by turning off your electricity with the smart grid
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:20.040]  it's all becoming so insane that it's hard to deal with it's just hard it's
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:25.200]  difficult to communicate this to people who aren't on board if somebody is less
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:29.520]  if you're listening to this show for the first time you must be blown away you
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:34.960]  must be just going what this how could this be this contradicts everything I've
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:39.280]  seen on CNN or even Fox News or all these other conventional news programs how
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:45.080]  could any of this be true how could the the mammogram ads by Susan G. Coman for
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:49.520]  the cure how could those be fraudulent well they are you know how could these
[02:46:49.520 --> 02:46:54.240]  shootings be staged well they are you know we're not asking you to believe
[02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:59.440]  something as crazy we're asking you to wake up and see reality and deal with
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:04.240]  reality pull your head out of the sand you know stop being and stop burying
[02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:08.440]  yourself from the real world around you and start actually dealing with it
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:12.960]  because we got to stop the mass death we got to stop the chemotherapy which of
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:18.840]  course has its roots by the way in in you know I got to say IG Farben Nazi
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:22.160]  Germany Nazi Germany chemical experiments on human beings that's
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:25.840]  where it really has its history hey how many minutes do we have left in this
[02:47:25.840 --> 02:47:33.280]  segment guys you know I'm sorry I just get carried away with all this oh it's
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:36.960]  too much to deal with I want to go to a caller because I know I know everybody's
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:42.080]  got passion about all these subjects we've got Clark in Arizona a former
[02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:46.200]  police officer who's been holding Clark thank you for holding and what are your
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:51.000]  thoughts sir you're on the air well my thoughts are very very similar to some
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.360]  of your previous callers this is all stated that no doubt my mind about it
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:01.760]  I was forced recon United States Marine Corps I did two of two investments I'm
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:09.120]  also a former peace officer I'm about to become another one I think the most of
[02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:13.760]  you hit on one subject that I was really listening to was marksmanship skills
[02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:17.640]  yeah I'll take a lot more than being a shark shooter to survive what's coming
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:22.560]  is it's coming there's no doubt my mind the worst thing that can happen is a
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:27.200]  civil war well we can ourselves from within and that will allow the UN to
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:32.000]  come in and do their mop up that's right there are so many veterans in this
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:36.760]  country but mine I'm being one of them they're willing to donate our time to
[02:48:36.760 --> 02:48:41.760]  teach people escape and a vision that's very important close-quarters combat
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:47.440]  another important but and other things that they need to know is how to get a
[02:48:47.440 --> 02:48:52.320]  topple map of the area they live in learn how to use a lens that encompass
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:58.760]  do not trust GPS could be a bit of be manipulated that's right
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:05.520]  and freeze-dried foods have a small pack for everybody in your family so if you
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:09.760]  have to get out you can get out quick you're not gonna have time to take TV the

[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:19.880]  order to travel fast you have to travel light yeah well well said where can
[02:49:19.880 --> 02:49:25.840]  civilians learn these skills any ideas many of us better for more than willing
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:31.800]  to teach these people our neighbors our friends and any community the skills they
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:36.400]  need the basic skills that we certainly don't have the time to get into
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:40.920]  everything that we learned the hard way but given the basic skills that they can
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:44.000]  use and they can hone themselves just by going out on a weekend with their
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:49.440]  family yeah learn how to use that compass learn how to travel at night well I
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:53.680]  agree with you I see a lot of people buying gear but they may end up heavy
[02:49:53.680 --> 02:49:57.360]  on the gear but not knowing how to use it a lot of stuff sits on the shelf and
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:01.040]  they don't they you can't pull it out on the day you need it and try to figure it
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:06.520]  out exactly and I want to touch on one thing real quick before you run out of
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:13.520]  time here and for myself yeah go ahead what if we the people the majority of

[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:21.600]  of the video that I put together called why doctors are more dangerous than
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:25.880]  guns and you can find the entire video on YouTube just search for that title why
[02:54:25.880 --> 02:54:30.440]  doctors are more dangerous than guns or search for it on natural news dot com or
[02:54:30.440 --> 02:54:33.120]  info wars dot com anyway we'll go to that video and then I'll be back at the
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:37.320]  very end to wrap it up so here's the video
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:44.280]  gun control hinges on the idea that so-called gun violence is epidemic
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:51.640]  across America as President Obama said about the 2012 Aurora Colorado Batman
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:57.080]  movie theater shooting quote every day the number of young people we lose to
[02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:00.800]  violence is about the same as the number of people we lost in that movie
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:06.600]  theater for every Columbine or Virginia Tech there are dozens gun down on the
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:12.320]  streets of Chicago and Atlanta here in what he didn't say however is that
[02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:20.000]  every day 290 people are killed by FDA approved prescription drugs and that's
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:24.040]  the conservative number published by the Journal of the American Medical
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:27.280]  Association the source of this information
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:36.080]  drama volume 284 number 4 July 26 2000 authored by Dr. Barbara Starfield MD of
[02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:41.560]  the John Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health that study which is 12
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:47.120]  years old and drug deaths have risen considerably since then documents 106
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:52.360]  thousand deaths per year from the adverse effects of FDA approved
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:57.520]  prescription medications to reach this number from outbreaks of violent
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:56:02.600]  shootings you'd have to see an Aurora Colorado Batman movie massacre take
[02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:12.400]  place every hour of every day 365 days a year if a massacre of people using
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:17.720]  slugs of lead is bad why is a massacre of people using deadly chemicals
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:24.320]  perfectly acceptable no one in Washington talks about prescription
[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:29.840]  drug deaths there are no sobbing victims shown on the evening news this
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:36.920]  chemical massacre happens quietly behind closed doors yet to achieve this
[02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:41.160]  level of mass death in the world of plane crashes for example you'd have to
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:48.040]  see a jumbo jet airliner crashing into the ground every day of the year but
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:52.680]  that's only the beginning of the mass death caused by modern medicine where
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:58.000]  greed-driven doctors are routinely bribed by the drug giants and thereby make the
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:04.920]  Joker James Holmes look like a boy scout in comparison as natural news has
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:12.480]  revealed just one company Glaxo Smith Klein had a bribery network of 49,000
[02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:18.160]  doctors who received financial kickbacks to prescribe more Glaxo pharmaceuticals
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:24.640]  to more patients the company admitted to bribing doctors and paid a three
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:31.000]  billion dollar settlement to the federal government in 2012 according to the
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:36.520]  report death by medicine by doctors Gary Knoll Carolyn Dean Martin Feldman
[02:57:36.520 --> 02:57:45.040]  Deborah Razio and Dorothy Smith the medical establishment kills 783,936
[02:57:45.040 --> 02:57:52.120]  people in the United States every year those deaths include 106,000 Americans
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:59.600]  killed from drug side effects 115,000 Americans killed from bed sores 98,000

[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:27.680]  alright that's the video it continues just search YouTube for why doctors are
