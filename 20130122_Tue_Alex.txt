[00:00.000 --> 00:12.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.120 --> 00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.800 --> 00:37.160]  Alex Jones
[00:37.160 --> 00:44.880]  ladies and gentlemen it is Tuesday the 22nd day of January 2013 I am your host
[00:44.880 --> 00:50.760]  Alex Jones we're going to be live here for the next three hours and we do have
[00:50.760 --> 00:55.320]  a guest who's going to be joining us a little bit later in the broadcast in
[00:55.320 --> 01:01.600]  fact several guests I'll tell you about that information coming up in the second
[01:01.600 --> 01:07.640]  segment here today more about why Max Keiser is going to be joining us and
[01:07.640 --> 01:11.800]  also Lloyd Chapman popping in Obama's considering shutting down the federal
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.920]  Small Business Bureau just amazing information I mean why even have it
[01:16.920 --> 01:19.680]  there they already don't give the contracts of small businesses anyways
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.560]  we're going to quick update on that continued destruction of our economy
[01:23.560 --> 01:27.320]  while telling the public the government's doing everything it can to get
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.540]  the economy going the name of the game is economic domination that's how we're
[01:31.540 --> 01:34.480]  being dominated but the globalists want to back that up with a physical
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.120]  domination sometimes I take off for three or four days and the so-called
[01:40.120 --> 01:46.240]  vacation turns into more work than just you know staying at home but I was able
[01:46.240 --> 01:53.600]  to take off three days and go down to Big Bend where I hadn't been in decades
[01:53.600 --> 02:01.440]  down on the Texas Mexico border in south west Texas very romantic scenery that
[02:01.440 --> 02:07.360]  the desert speaks to a man's soul I guess just as the sea does and I just
[02:07.360 --> 02:13.360]  had a lot of epiphanies clarification it's good to slow down sometimes and
[02:13.360 --> 02:19.560]  and every time I do slow down I realize how much I do need to take a pit stop
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.720]  just because then I'm more focused and and more clear and it's the same for
[02:26.720 --> 02:31.440]  everybody but I feel completely rejuvenated and it's probably the high
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.720]  mountain air and hiking up mountains and getting in the hot springs the natural
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.880]  hot springs there by the Rio Grande and watching the Mexican ranchers ride
[02:40.880 --> 02:45.040]  around on their horses look like right across the border look like something
[02:45.040 --> 02:50.120]  right out of a Western just very romantic scenery and of course public
[02:50.120 --> 02:54.520]  school educated people will think romantic means just like you take your
[02:54.520 --> 02:58.080]  wife and do something romantic no I mean romantic of you for some people out
[02:58.080 --> 03:01.200]  there who I know don't know what I mean by it cuz sometimes I get emails when
[03:01.200 --> 03:07.240]  talking about something being romantic romantic the romantic novels or people
[03:07.240 --> 03:12.960]  in ships and storms or astronauts going to the moon is romantic or beautiful
[03:12.960 --> 03:18.520]  scenery or things that stir the heart and the soul that's romantic and just
[03:18.520 --> 03:23.760]  very very good for the soul also there's no Wi-Fi there and cell phones don't
[03:23.760 --> 03:28.920]  work anywhere but up close to the top of mountains I'd have to get up on a high
[03:28.920 --> 03:32.960]  up on a mountain and sit there and transmit with my cell phones the two
[03:32.960 --> 03:37.200]  videos I did shoot while I was there to the town 30 miles away at night with the
[03:37.200 --> 03:42.360]  little blinking lights far away line of sight just amazing technology I'm gonna
[03:42.360 --> 03:46.540]  attempt to get into all of the news when we come back and it's just more of the
[03:46.540 --> 03:52.280]  same more confirmation of just how much trouble we're in but more facets of the
[03:52.280 --> 03:58.760]  enemy as more detail is filled in as it gets closer and closer back to
[03:58.760 --> 04:02.880]  in many cases the tyranny is not close anymore it's sitting on top of us
[04:02.880 --> 04:09.440]  spitting in our faces it is all over even mainstream news that Western
[04:09.440 --> 04:14.040]  governments are really running the al-qaeda groups in Africa who are
[04:14.040 --> 04:18.640]  blowing up chemical plants and taking hostages and things like that
[04:18.640 --> 04:24.480]  the african invasion was shut up four years ago even before Obama was put into
[04:24.480 --> 04:29.040]  office four and a half years ago that's why he's the black face so they can sell
[04:29.040 --> 04:33.440]  that so the left won't say anything cuz I mean he's black it must be okay and
[04:33.440 --> 04:36.720]  they just use that as an emotional cover for what they're doing but it's pretty
[04:36.720 --> 04:41.400]  amazing headline London Independent terror in North Africa our Westerners

[08:10.920 --> 08:33.960]  resistance you are listening to the Alex Jones show
[08:33.960 --> 08:39.760]  ladies and gentlemen I am your host Alex Jones I am a defender of Liberty I am
[08:39.760 --> 08:46.200]  very upset about the tyrants that are taking over our planet and I am very
[08:46.200 --> 08:51.280]  disgusted by their open attacks on all of our basic liberties not just the
[08:51.280 --> 08:55.800]  Second Amendment and that's why I'm on air to try to set brush fires in the
[08:55.800 --> 09:02.520]  minds of men and women everywhere to defend their freedoms that were hard
[09:02.520 --> 09:08.240]  fought and hard won by our forebears now remember the United States
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.560]  geographically is really a small country and we've only been five percent of the
[09:13.560 --> 09:17.400]  world's population roughly in the last hundred years those numbers have stayed
[09:17.400 --> 09:20.600]  about steady we're currently about five and a half percent of the world's
[09:20.600 --> 09:26.920]  population but we had half of the world's wealth half of the world's
[09:26.920 --> 09:34.280]  wealth and now we're losing that wealth why did five percent of the world's
[09:34.280 --> 09:39.160]  population have half the wealth because we kicked the royalty out we kicked the
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.600]  monopolies out we kicked the power combines out who always take over and
[09:44.600 --> 09:50.200]  always seek to make everyone else poor and dependent and then incredible
[09:50.200 --> 09:56.400]  poverty always follows that is what these oligarchs do that's what they set
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.640]  up in the Mesoamerican kingdoms in Central and South America and southern
[10:01.640 --> 10:06.760]  North America the Aztecs the Toltecs the whole Mayan culture that's what the
[10:06.760 --> 10:11.960]  ancient Babylonians establishment it's what the Egyptians established it's what
[10:11.960 --> 10:18.240]  the Romans established it's what every other culture establishes a form of
[10:18.240 --> 10:25.160]  feudalism it is not an accident that they're trying to make us poor this is a
[10:25.160 --> 10:34.880]  designed global engineered program all right I have got so much news that I
[10:34.880 --> 10:40.920]  want to cover here today since I was out Friday Sunday and Monday and I want to
[10:40.920 --> 10:47.760]  just thank Paul Joseph Watson and of course Mike Adams Rappaport and others
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.920]  and the crew they all did a great job driving back from Big Ben yesterday when
[10:52.920 --> 10:58.240]  I was able to get internet I tuned into the iPhone app and listened to large
[10:58.240 --> 11:07.880]  portions of of Friday's transmission and just amazing information with Mike
[11:07.880 --> 11:15.440]  Adams on that broadcast and obviously I called in on Thursdays or or Friday show
[11:15.440 --> 11:24.800]  myself but there is just so much to cover and so let me just go over some of
[11:24.800 --> 11:29.160]  the some of the headlines that we're going to be talking about here today
[11:29.160 --> 11:35.240]  Nobel Prize nominee Obama asked military leaders if they will fire on US citizens
[11:35.240 --> 11:45.760]  shot claim purported to come from one of America's foremost military heroes and
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.760]  Paul then links to the army training manual from 2010 where they have begun
[11:50.760 --> 11:54.200]  to openly train to take on American gun owners and confiscate our firearms
[11:54.200 --> 11:59.760]  trainings predates that but now it's public and so I mean my point is why
[11:59.760 --> 12:02.720]  even go with the claim even though we're tracking down this individual to get
[12:02.720 --> 12:08.800]  them on I mean it's all right there out in the open already that's what Homeland
[12:08.800 --> 12:13.160]  Security is as a system to wage war against American gun owners so we're
[12:13.160 --> 12:18.360]  going to be going over that report also Obama's inaugural address Second
[12:18.360 --> 12:24.720]  Amendment is obsolete he says that when the times change so must we I guess
[12:24.720 --> 12:29.480]  we're going back to ancient Rome where slaves were disarmed so we've got that
[12:29.480 --> 12:36.240]  report CNN communist Network trying to shove gun control down our throats we're
[12:36.240 --> 12:39.840]  going to go over some of that new push and some more good news CBS news
[12:39.840 --> 12:46.120]  reporting Missouri sheriff's sheriff's whole bunch of them pledge not to enforce
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.240]  Obama's gun control law saying they're unconstitutional that's also being
[12:51.240 --> 12:55.680]  reported by NBC
[12:55.680 --> 13:00.240]  we now have
[13:01.560 --> 13:06.240]  Texas sheriff's coming out and saying the same thing so it is spreading you
[13:06.240 --> 13:10.760]  see the sheriff is a constitutional office
[13:11.320 --> 13:15.600]  and sheriff's are elected representatives and sheriff's in an
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.840]  emergency are the head honcho in the county they can actually declare
[13:20.840 --> 13:26.280]  martial law but instead you've got the federal government trying to dissolve
[13:26.280 --> 13:33.920]  sheriff's through the states trying to offer money if the counties and if the
[13:33.920 --> 13:37.400]  cities will get together
[13:38.400 --> 13:44.080]  and either get rid of the sheriff outright or if they can't do that make
[13:44.080 --> 13:49.440]  them unelected and a creature of the system we're going to be going over that
[13:49.440 --> 13:54.880]  report today and then coming up after I've had a chance to get into the Second
[13:54.880 --> 13:58.200]  Amendment attack the latest developments there in the economy we're going to
[13:58.200 --> 14:01.960]  cover the London Independent and several other mainstream articles terror in North
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.720]  Africa our Westerners pulling strings and the Algerian Prime Minister has come
[14:06.720 --> 14:11.960]  out and said basically these are white commandos commanding a bunch of jihadis
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.520]  taking people hostage and blowing things up and then the West gets to go in and
[14:16.520 --> 14:22.400]  invade the commandos pull out and the West then attacks empty facilities but
[14:22.400 --> 14:27.240]  then gets to occupy in the name of defeating an enemy and and that's what
[14:27.240 --> 14:30.960]  al-qaeda has always been it's a stimulant but the globalist have attack
[14:30.960 --> 14:34.640]  or take the blame for an attack it's actually carried out by Western powers
[14:34.640 --> 14:38.840]  the criminal elements that run us and and then you have the excuse to invade
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.160]  and take over the region and every African country has either had a US
[14:43.160 --> 14:49.560]  troops or NATO troops under Afrikan added to it or they've built up on the
[14:49.560 --> 14:55.000]  borders of those countries and of course we told you an Obama deception at length
[14:55.000 --> 15:00.560]  that there would be a major invasion of Africa to take over all of the natural
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.640]  resources not already controlled by the West and it is neo-colonialism but
[15:05.640 --> 15:11.240]  remember you don't get the stolen goods the stolen goods are used to be shipped
[15:11.240 --> 15:16.440]  to China to be produced there under a monopoly deal where the West gets the
[15:16.440 --> 15:21.360]  rare earths and gives it to China and then they use that to deindustrialize
[15:21.360 --> 15:24.960]  the West so a lot of good old boys go well you know what let's go take it from
[15:24.960 --> 15:28.800]  the Africans or let's go take the oil from the Muslims and that's actually
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.200]  used to increase prices in fact if you go back to 1990 the real reason the UN
[15:33.200 --> 15:37.280]  and the US was mad at Saddam who had worked for the quote United States and
[15:37.280 --> 15:41.960]  attacking Iran and he was actually put into power by the CIA that's all
[15:41.960 --> 15:46.240]  declassified congressional hearings on record he was actually a CIA trained
[15:46.240 --> 15:52.520]  assassin in his when he was in his 20s and and then the US helped install a new
[15:52.520 --> 15:55.960]  government he became the head of security then he helped run a Western
[15:55.960 --> 15:59.920]  backed coup in 79 and then he was told go ahead and attack Iran and given
[15:59.920 --> 16:03.960]  upwards of 40 billion dollars and and Saddam then wanted to become
[16:03.960 --> 16:09.520]  independent kind of like Hosni Mubarak another puppet in Egypt and he actually
[16:09.520 --> 16:14.160]  wanted to build up Iraq you say what you want about him but he did women got to
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.000]  go to university they put rock and roll music on the radio Playboy in the stores
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.640]  and not even saying that's a good thing but that's you know it was freedom
[16:21.640 --> 16:26.280]  certainly I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to get Playboy or have rock and
[16:26.280 --> 16:31.600]  roll my point is is that is that is that is that they westernized and they became
[16:31.600 --> 16:36.560]  very wealthy and he stopped all the ethnic fighting that was going on and so
[16:36.560 --> 16:39.760]  they set Saddam up and told him go ahead and invade quite we were not gonna get
[16:39.760 --> 16:43.160]  involved you're our ally we don't get involved in inter-arab affairs that had
[16:43.160 --> 16:47.960]  been his cues eight years before to attack Iran in the seven-year Iran Iraq
[16:47.960 --> 16:52.520]  war so he went along with that so here's the problem with each article each each
[16:52.520 --> 16:56.960]  each each little point I said I get to this later turns into a whole larger
[16:56.960 --> 17:01.640]  story of what's happening and what's crazy is this is all publicly admitted
[17:01.640 --> 17:05.040]  it's just not generally known just like a general public does not know the three
[17:05.040 --> 17:09.840]  branches of government or does not know what sodium chloride is that's why most
[17:09.840 --> 17:15.200]  surveys they say ban it it's of course salt or hydrogen dioxide most people in
[17:15.200 --> 17:19.640]  surveys say ban that because it sounds scary it's it's water the people perish
[17:19.640 --> 17:23.960]  for lack of knowledge the truth will set you free knowledge is power all those
[17:23.960 --> 17:28.960]  maxims are so true and so central it's why I restate them so my point is
[17:28.960 --> 17:35.640]  getting back to you don't get the goods of the spoils Saddam's big crime in 1990
[17:35.640 --> 17:40.640]  and 1991 was he was paying off his 40 billion dollar debt and he was doing it
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.960]  by flooding the market with oil and if you'll remember I mean gas was something
[17:44.960 --> 17:50.360]  like what was gas prices pre pre-war it was something like 50 cents for just a
[17:50.360 --> 17:53.960]  ridiculous number you could pull that number up I know it was way under a dollar
[17:53.960 --> 18:01.920]  now yeah 60 cents double-check that though I know your memories right mines
[18:01.920 --> 18:06.280]  right yeah I was like 60 65 cents pre Desert Shield then it jacked up to a
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.400]  dollar fifty or something and again you know the good old boys are like get that
[18:10.400 --> 18:14.760]  oil get them Arabs oil ever gonna get it oh you got it all right
[18:14.760 --> 18:18.960]  Saddam was flooding the market in a free market with oil to pay off his debts
[18:18.960 --> 18:23.640]  OPEC went completely ape it was all over the Wall Street Journal I was even
[18:23.640 --> 18:28.440]  reading it at the time you know I was in high school and I remember watching the
[18:28.440 --> 18:32.580]  news because I was into CNN and c-span and I mean I was following it and I
[18:32.580 --> 18:37.520]  remember that I remember that gas was 55 60 65 cent spending on where you lived
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.320]  and then shot way over a dollar fifty once the war or even once the Desert
[18:42.320 --> 18:48.320]  Shield started but my point is now you pay you know close to four bucks in many
[18:48.320 --> 18:53.920]  areas so let me explain something when our troops go and back up other groups
[18:53.920 --> 18:58.800]  to take over and destabilize African countries and when all this happens
[18:58.800 --> 19:03.040]  you're not going to get any of the goods you pay to get the bankers the resources
[19:03.040 --> 19:09.080]  and then they all use it to leverage the market to consolidate and destroy the
[19:09.080 --> 19:12.880]  market because they're in an act of economic scorched earth total takeover
[19:12.880 --> 19:17.400]  so we have these articles where as we told you they're using al-qaeda to
[19:17.400 --> 19:24.320]  attack all over Africa and then the US military and NATO and the French and the
[19:24.320 --> 19:28.680]  rest of them go in there under the cover of African invading the whole place and
[19:28.680 --> 19:32.600]  even the African leaders are going these are blonde haired blue-eyed men with
[19:32.600 --> 19:37.500]  with English accents they are attacking no we do not want you you you are doing
[19:37.500 --> 19:43.120]  it no oh no we're invading because al-qaeda took US citizens hostage and
[19:43.120 --> 19:46.680]  the whole thing is a theater deal and that happened with the invasion of
[19:46.680 --> 19:49.840]  Panama remember that that turned out that was all staged there were no
[19:49.840 --> 19:55.320]  hostages at the University same deal this is purely manufactured everywhere
[19:55.320 --> 19:58.360]  we'll be right back stay with us
[19:59.960 --> 20:05.200]  looking back on 2012 we asked ourselves how did we ever survive from natural
[20:05.200 --> 20:09.320]  disasters like hurricane sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family

[24:04.440 --> 24:08.520]  on the GCN radio network
[24:08.520 --> 24:16.640]  you know I could have just simplified everything I covered in the last segment
[24:16.640 --> 24:23.800]  and said Shaddam Hussein's big crime was that he was over pumping oil in 1990 to
[24:23.800 --> 24:28.440]  pay off his debts to the West and they were telling him OPEC and the West was
[24:28.440 --> 24:32.560]  saying stop doing that you're making oil prices too low we want to gouge people
[24:32.560 --> 24:36.000]  and he said no I'm gonna pay my debts off first he said well then forgive my
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.360]  debts or cut them I want to be a sovereign country and they said no
[24:39.360 --> 24:43.760]  you're going to be under globalist control again we're conquered by these
[24:43.760 --> 24:49.160]  foreign international mega banks foreign is even the word global outside the law
[24:49.160 --> 24:55.400]  mafias who brag that they've conquered us and they'll go put people like Saddam
[24:55.400 --> 24:59.940]  in or Hazi Mubarak and then later set them up and bring them down to
[24:59.940 --> 25:05.580]  destabilize the country to have a civil war to destroy its economy so they can
[25:05.580 --> 25:10.020]  come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar and it's in the IMF World Bank
[25:10.020 --> 25:14.160]  documents that got released when Joseph stick let's quit the World Bank in 2002
[25:14.160 --> 25:20.100]  now ten plus years ago hard to believe time is flying that that fast see that's
[25:20.100 --> 25:23.680]  why I'm frustrated I know how cold-blooded the globalist are I mean
[25:23.680 --> 25:29.060]  these are military financial conquerors these are hardcore systematic
[25:29.060 --> 25:35.680]  mechanized corporate criminals who hate the free market and want a global
[25:35.680 --> 25:41.440]  monopoly run by them and then I've got to sit there and watch Joe Biden on TV
[25:41.440 --> 25:46.080]  going we can't let one more child die not one more and then that way when one
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.360]  more gets killed by a gun see another one see it's your fault putting that
[25:50.360 --> 25:56.000]  guilt on us well how about just never be born then never drive a car I never have
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.160]  emotions well that's their goal for the general public is to turn us into
[26:00.160 --> 26:06.240]  biological androids to turn us under the new freedom initiative into a bunch of
[26:06.240 --> 26:10.760]  drugged out zombies and that's only in the interim phase while we're being
[26:10.760 --> 26:15.080]  phased out as the establishment goes to robotics and automation and that's their
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.600]  words whether that really works or not whether this plan actually will succeed
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.040]  people think oh man you know you claim this is happening this is not my claim
[26:24.040 --> 26:28.680]  this is the establishment all they talk about their hundred plus year plan that
[26:28.680 --> 26:33.840]  they're following and let me tell you it leads to a very horrible place see I'm
[26:33.840 --> 26:39.480]  not telling you what I think is going to happen I'm not fans think I'm super
[26:39.480 --> 26:44.160]  smart and that man how does he keep knowing what's going to happen and then
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.400]  my detractors think I'm up here like writing science fiction on the air
[26:48.400 --> 26:55.080]  telling you what I imagine is going to happen because it's so fantastical and
[26:55.080 --> 27:01.400]  it's neither one I've read hundreds of books and probably over a thousand
[27:01.400 --> 27:05.700]  different white papers put out by the CFR put out by the Club of Rome you say
[27:05.700 --> 27:09.560]  where are they what is the endgame.com has a bibliography on that film great
[27:09.560 --> 27:13.560]  place to start watch my films I make a claim I show you the bill I show you the
[27:13.560 --> 27:18.360]  document I go to the UT library and get the Club of Rome publication 1966
[27:18.360 --> 27:22.800]  I show you where they say they're going to end the family
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.000]  I show you where they say they're going to break down all of society and make us
[27:27.000 --> 27:31.840]  basically drugged up brainwashed idiots before they release the control bio
[27:31.840 --> 27:37.520]  plagues and wipe almost all of us out I show you the the training videos they
[27:37.520 --> 27:43.000]  show kids in the UK about the planned Opelis and people watch it who aren't
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.520]  children and think this is a satirical joke of a futuristic police state the
[27:47.520 --> 27:52.040]  planned Opelis it's not it's an association with mainstream television
[27:52.040 --> 27:55.880]  and newspapers and the British government putting out videos for kids
[27:55.880 --> 28:01.560]  where mommy's the boss robots tell you what you can do daddy's a joke and no
[28:01.560 --> 28:04.560]  one's allowed to go outside without government authorization and you never
[28:04.560 --> 28:08.600]  get meat anymore and you live in giant compact cities and anybody else that
[28:08.600 --> 28:13.920]  won't lives in these giant urban controlled slums or drones surveil
[28:13.920 --> 28:19.520]  everyone you go well that's the 1970s judge dread judge dread is only writing
[28:19.520 --> 28:23.440]  about what the globalist actually plan you see that's what you've got to get
[28:23.440 --> 28:31.920]  folks is that it's not art that that life is then imitating it is life that
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.800]  art is imitating and it's so frustrating that these globalist want to take us to
[28:37.800 --> 28:41.760]  this ugly place are doing everything they can to hurt us and then I've got to
[28:41.760 --> 28:48.600]  sit there and see Time magazine the gun fighters and on the cover of it it shows
[28:48.600 --> 28:57.480]  Biden Bloomberg and shooting victim Giffords and you know what's interesting
[28:57.480 --> 29:01.160]  is she was pro-gun before she got it she pretty much still is I don't know how
[29:01.160 --> 29:07.120]  they gotta be part of this I guess she's been obviously injured shot in the head
[29:07.120 --> 29:13.480]  but the point is is that we're now going to they're the gun fighters they know
[29:13.480 --> 29:17.520]  there's that romantic idea of Americana and guns so they turn it around these
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.440]  are the gun fighters they're trying to take your guns actually they are arming
[29:22.440 --> 29:26.200]  themselves the government is they are buying a billion six bullets they are
[29:26.200 --> 29:30.000]  buying the armored vehicles they are training to make war against us while
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.000]  collapsing the society they are the gun fighters they're coming with the guns
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.720]  they're wearing the black hats not Giffords the puppet but the other two
[29:39.720 --> 29:45.320]  certainly Bloomberg is the chief leader for the foreign banks in Wall Street to
[29:45.320 --> 29:50.120]  dominate and disarm us so we can be fully occupied these are conquerors we're

[34:03.120 --> 34:06.640]  if they really wanted to stop the violence Obama would have said

[34:14.600 --> 34:21.800]  percent of these mass shootings and he would go on to say guns are good we've
[34:21.800 --> 34:26.860]  seen a 49 percent the last 20 years FBI statistics from the local governments
[34:26.860 --> 34:30.960]  very accurate numbers that's why they hide them
[34:30.960 --> 34:38.600]  49 percent drop in crimes using guns 21 percent drop in the same period on
[34:38.600 --> 34:42.560]  overall violent crime we've shown you those numbers at nauseum go to fbi.gov
[34:42.560 --> 34:46.840]  and just go into it there's thousands of pages it'll blow you away all compiled
[34:46.840 --> 34:51.360]  locally very accurate numbers murders muggings carjackings you name it I mean
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.760]  imagine the level of this hoax imagine the level of what we're talking about
[34:56.760 --> 35:00.120]  can they stop the violence and you notice they all keep saying we can never
[35:00.120 --> 35:04.400]  have one more child shot I mean that's ridiculous never have one more child
[35:04.400 --> 35:08.600]  dying a car wreck one more child drowned I mean the numbers like 15 something
[35:08.600 --> 35:11.600]  times drowned every year would die from guns we're gonna ban swimming pools
[35:11.600 --> 35:17.320]  gonna ban showers gonna ban people fall every day in every I mean it's more
[35:17.320 --> 35:20.160]  probably every hour I mean the number is in the tens of thousands every year
[35:20.160 --> 35:26.040]  falling and hitting their heads in the bathtub and dying but again they
[35:26.040 --> 35:30.280]  emotionalize it they hype it they they stand on the graves of the children
[35:30.280 --> 35:34.600]  Obama uses the children like human shields to sell his agenda and says I'll
[35:34.600 --> 35:39.760]  get it done for you it is over the top that's why I get so angry but they're
[35:39.760 --> 35:43.280]  targeting well-meaning dumbed-down Americans that like come on you care
[35:43.280 --> 35:47.840]  about the kids right let's take the guns for them oh I guess you're right
[35:47.840 --> 35:50.800]  but Bill Clinton came out over the weekend I thought we have a video clip
[35:50.800 --> 35:55.840]  up at info wars calm saying don't trivialize the gun culture these people
[35:55.840 --> 36:02.640]  are hard to beat and they're getting mobilized because we understand it's the
[36:02.640 --> 36:07.360]  final straw it's the bellwether it's the canary in the coal mine it shows the
[36:07.360 --> 36:16.920]  system is going for broke absolutely going for broke in a big way
[36:17.560 --> 36:21.200]  on every front and of course they're going after our liberties on every front
[36:21.200 --> 36:24.960]  and our forebears warned us about this over and over again and history has
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.920]  shown in other nations what this means that's why it's such a big deal and
[36:29.920 --> 36:33.920]  while they want to control the debate they're not controlling the debate and
[36:33.920 --> 36:38.280]  this is how wars happen because we're committed to our cause they're committed
[36:38.280 --> 36:41.960]  to theirs that's why I want to talk to those in the middle the police and
[36:41.960 --> 36:45.300]  military and say to you you're being trained to take our guns that's now
[36:45.300 --> 36:48.640]  public you're being trained that veterans and gun owners and George
[36:48.640 --> 36:53.280]  Washington are bad guys that's public now as well think of how otherworldly and
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.640]  ridiculous that is and how absurdist but it's really happening
[36:58.640 --> 37:02.960]  because they have to demonize us ahead of this civil war they want to start and
[37:02.960 --> 37:07.480]  that's what Homeland Security I saw an article yesterday Aaron Dykes covered it
[37:07.480 --> 37:12.520]  so the dead David Ortiz on the news where they said Oh nationwide they're
[37:12.520 --> 37:17.040]  gonna put gunshot detectors up for Homeland Security to detect shooters and
[37:17.040 --> 37:22.040]  I went and looked it up and sure enough it's microphones see oh we're gonna spy
[37:22.040 --> 37:28.200]  on you cuz of guns but we're listening to you as well oh
[37:28.200 --> 37:31.920]  everybody's got to go get a psychiatric evaluation and the government will
[37:31.920 --> 37:35.040]  decide if you're mentally ill and by the way it's mentally ill to want to own a
[37:35.040 --> 37:38.800]  gun notice you hear that and gun owners are Nazis and gun owners are clan
[37:38.800 --> 37:42.800]  members and gun owners help kill the kids at Sandy Hook and gun owners are
[37:42.800 --> 37:47.680]  scum and gun owners are trash and gun owners are filth I mean you're seeing
[37:47.680 --> 37:53.000]  Bob Shafer we defeated Hitler we can defeat the gun owners CBS news and a
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.720]  normal informed person goes man that that that's discrediting not if we don't
[37:57.720 --> 38:03.040]  resist it to say how dare you they will normalize the idea that we are criminals
[38:03.040 --> 38:09.640]  inherently because we own guns I mean that tells you how bad these
[38:09.640 --> 38:13.280]  people are that every FEMA training manual and I've got video of it in road
[38:13.280 --> 38:17.040]  to tyranny it's online they go and tell police and police have called in you've
[38:17.040 --> 38:20.840]  heard them yeah no we get sent to training especially the officers you
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.120]  know the sergeant sent up where they sit around for three days they send them off
[38:24.120 --> 38:29.560]  to these resorts and the feds come in and they sit there and badmouth America
[38:29.560 --> 38:35.040]  and tell them how bad America is I mean there's the enemy right there
[38:35.040 --> 38:39.320]  imagine a movie where you know the feds call in the cops and go the founding
[38:39.320 --> 38:43.680]  fathers are bad guns are bad families are bad you can't trust people that talk
[38:43.680 --> 38:47.760]  about wanting sovereignty they're the enemy we've got a train to take their
[38:47.760 --> 38:51.600]  guns I mean right there folks use the bad guy right there is the foreign
[38:51.600 --> 38:56.600]  operative I mean it's so over the top but that's how tyrannies are Joseph
[38:56.600 --> 39:01.080]  Goebbels Nazi propaganda minister and I've read many of his writings said over
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.840]  and over again and he admired Edward Bernays u.s. propagandists but admired
[39:05.840 --> 39:09.120]  him but wanted to kill him it was declassified they had plans that when
[39:09.120 --> 39:13.280]  they took the u.s. by having a occupy government like you don't just come have
[39:13.280 --> 39:16.480]  the French stand down you don't just have the American stand down they were
[39:16.480 --> 39:20.560]  going to have a deal with an American government with Senator Bush Prescott
[39:20.560 --> 39:24.280]  Bush this came out in McCormick Dickstein hearings we can read the
[39:24.280 --> 39:28.660]  congressional record they were gonna have him and others led by Smedley
[39:28.660 --> 39:32.080]  Butler as the president the two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner two
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.000]  star general who had very high approval ratings they were gonna have him as the
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.600]  new dictator and he said listen I'm not gonna do that and help stop it but it
[39:40.600 --> 39:44.360]  was so incredible it would have brought the whole system down so they they shut
[39:44.360 --> 39:49.360]  it down and nobody went to jail except German spies who were actually German
[39:49.360 --> 39:53.920]  again this is history when you know this there's no going back that's how the
[39:53.920 --> 40:00.000]  bankers have taken over is with collaborators but it's a corporate
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.480]  takeover they've gotten very sophisticated the British Empire in the
[40:03.480 --> 40:07.040]  last hundred years started losing militarily so they said we'll go into
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.000]  the US we'll set up the CFR we'll take over their government not for the
[40:11.000 --> 40:18.400]  British people the British corporate imperial model after World War one they
[40:18.400 --> 40:21.440]  said we can't beat the Germans they've got all the science all the technology
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.240]  they call it the German problem in their newspapers and Lord Milner said this was
[40:25.240 --> 40:30.440]  in public newspapers he said we need to fund radicals in Germany help them
[40:30.440 --> 40:35.320]  basically have a civil war which Germany had in the streets we'll put radicals in
[40:35.320 --> 40:39.280]  and then we'll destroy them we'll give them weapons encourage them to attack
[40:39.280 --> 40:44.760]  Europe after they wreck Europe we'll then take over this is all good go look
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.440]  it up it was in the cover the front page of the Times of London I've read it the
[40:50.440 --> 40:58.680]  online scans this was in all our newspapers at the time
[40:58.680 --> 41:05.640]  just like they put Saddam in just like they create al-qaeda just like they're
[41:05.640 --> 41:10.440]  trying to radicalize the militias and get us led by feds inside militias to
[41:10.440 --> 41:16.200]  start an offensive fight they tried to start a civil war in 1993 and then again
[41:16.200 --> 41:21.400]  in 95 but the police wouldn't go along with it so they couldn't fully carry it
[41:21.400 --> 41:25.640]  out that's why they're trying to federalize see they they they know what
[41:25.640 --> 41:30.200]  they're doing again I had family who were colonels and
[41:30.200 --> 41:37.200]  people in the Confederacy but that doesn't mean that I was for the
[41:37.200 --> 41:44.880]  Confederacy the Confederacy was a tyranny but so was Lincoln see see it's
[41:44.880 --> 41:49.880]  not that one side was good one side was bad the south was wronged on tariffs
[41:49.880 --> 41:54.680]  that ripped off the south and not the north tariffs on on on agricultural
[41:54.680 --> 41:59.720]  goods not on finished goods not on industrial goods the taxes were wrong
[41:59.720 --> 42:04.400]  there's a lot of stuff went on but the point and of course Lincoln was a tyrant
[42:04.400 --> 42:09.520]  but he believed he was doing good the British came in and publicly financed
[42:09.520 --> 42:16.280]  the south to to and of course the north went along with the manipulation and
[42:16.280 --> 42:21.720]  and started the war with the south again the problem is it's all history if you
[42:21.720 --> 42:26.920]  just knew history folks you'd understand how this works now Obama is different
[42:26.920 --> 42:31.040]  he's not like Lincoln who was just trying to maintain control and went to
[42:31.040 --> 42:35.360]  tyranny and then didn't and of course then Lincoln didn't want to abuse the
[42:35.360 --> 42:39.080]  south with reconstruction so they killed him because they wanted the very same
[42:39.080 --> 42:43.640]  interest one to loot the south the globalist want crime
[42:43.640 --> 42:53.000]  the globalist want control the the globalist want chaos and they want a
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.760]  civil war in this country and Ron Paul agrees with me it will cause a civil war
[42:56.760 --> 43:00.280]  when they come for the guns it's guaranteed and they know that and the
[43:00.280 --> 43:04.040]  only way to stop them is to go look we know you want to start a civil war we
[43:04.040 --> 43:07.520]  know you're foreign occupiers we know what you're doing we know you're
[43:07.520 --> 43:12.280]  illegitimate like the Vichy French again they didn't want to tell people in our
[43:12.280 --> 43:15.560]  history books that the French see everybody says the French gave up in two
[43:15.560 --> 43:20.800]  weeks there was only a few army groups that fought back in the French ninety
[43:20.800 --> 43:26.160]  plus percent stood down and became the new Vichy French government run out of
[43:26.160 --> 43:30.440]  Vichy France it was only the British that really fought a small expeditionary
[43:30.440 --> 43:36.320]  group that then ran to Dunkirk and you had the famous evacuation and Hitler
[43:36.320 --> 43:40.200]  still had a treaty with England that he thought they were going to follow to
[43:40.200 --> 43:43.840]  divide up Europe with him that's how they set him up so Albert sphere of the
[43:43.840 --> 43:48.120]  the vice Fuhrer the vice president flew over and parachuted in to meet with the
[43:48.120 --> 43:51.360]  Lord who'd made the agreement with him that's why they locked him up in the
[43:51.360 --> 43:55.640]  Tower of London never letting him talk to the media till he died
[43:55.640 --> 43:59.880]  oh you didn't know about the treaty England had with Hitler see folks this
[43:59.880 --> 44:05.160]  is all on the record but they won't put it on History Channel they put some of
[44:05.160 --> 44:09.640]  it on there our government put Mao Zedong into power now declassified
[44:09.640 --> 44:15.820]  John Birch society said that in the 50s declassified six years ago on History
[44:15.820 --> 44:20.180]  Channel talking to the ancient CIA section chief about putting now in in
[44:20.180 --> 44:23.880]  49 of course but you can't tell Americans that's the act like you're not
[44:23.880 --> 44:29.800]  friends until the 70s when ambassador Bush is sent over to make the deal then
[44:29.800 --> 44:33.440]  they use the Chinese slaves to leverage out the West and de-industrialize us
[44:33.440 --> 44:36.880]  consolidating power again
[44:36.880 --> 44:43.360]  and it's understanding all of this that will help us beat these globalist and so
[44:43.360 --> 44:46.600]  that's why people are like come on Alex don't you want some sensible gun control
[44:46.600 --> 44:50.840]  quotes you come part way yeah they always want us to give in something and
[44:50.840 --> 44:56.080]  then we never give anything to them it they try to act reasonable all day these
[44:56.080 --> 45:04.120]  are craven gangsters and their dupes who are coming after us and so I get
[45:04.120 --> 45:11.440]  mobilized I get angry I get upset it is not my wish to be up here at the tip of
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.840]  the spear it is not a very safe position to be in but there is no future if we
[45:15.840 --> 45:18.060]  don't beat these people let's go to some of these clips and then I'm gonna
[45:18.060 --> 45:21.600]  premiere an amazing special report put together by Aaron Dykes and crew
[45:21.600 --> 45:26.160]  founding fathers battle globalists from the grave we're gonna premiere this
[45:26.160 --> 45:30.520]  special report here on air that everyone needs to see it hasn't been uploaded to
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.340]  YouTube and high res yet I'm gonna have it uploaded the Alex Jones channel as
[45:34.340 --> 45:39.160]  soon as we can in high res there's a medium res version out there but I want
[45:39.160 --> 45:42.820]  to promote the high res one because it's such an important report and make it the
[45:42.820 --> 45:48.320]  featured video as soon as it's available but I've told you many times before this
[45:48.320 --> 45:51.960]  new piers Morgan thing happened that every time I'm at the DNC covering an
[45:51.960 --> 45:57.080]  event or every time I'm covering anarchist hired by the police every time
[45:57.080 --> 46:00.360]  I'm at a so-called liberal event when the cameras off they'll come over and
[46:00.360 --> 46:06.520]  grab me by the arm hoping I do something so the cops can arrest me I mean we've
[46:06.520 --> 46:09.360]  caught the police working with the anarchists countless times and it's been
[46:09.360 --> 46:14.040]  on record in Denver and other places they do this and they'll tell me they go
[46:14.040 --> 46:18.720]  when we take over you're dead and I'll go so you you're here with the police
[46:18.720 --> 46:22.040]  you'll see the cops watching ten feet away on little yeah you bet we are you
[46:22.040 --> 46:26.160]  punk I've even had them punch me in the back and then I turn around and see the
[46:26.160 --> 46:31.480]  cops waiting and then I know to control myself and Mike Hansen even caught some
[46:31.480 --> 46:36.920]  of this on tape at the G it was the Forbes meeting I guess back in 99 here
[46:36.920 --> 46:42.640]  in Austin but the point is is I've told you about this and you've also heard the
[46:42.640 --> 46:46.320]  quote Democrats talk about how you know I want to kill this person I want to
[46:46.320 --> 46:51.960]  kill that person Alec Baldwin and others I've actually been at the cocktail
[46:51.960 --> 46:54.960]  parties of these people occasionally when I got invited into things when I
[46:54.960 --> 46:58.720]  was against Bush not because I'm a socialist but because Bush was doing some
[46:58.720 --> 47:02.760]  bad things they were so politically tribal that I would get invited in
[47:02.760 --> 47:07.360]  Austin and New York and LA to cocktail parties with famous designers and
[47:07.360 --> 47:12.320]  Hollywood folks and they they sit around talking about how they want to kill
[47:12.320 --> 47:17.520]  conservatives and how disgusting the family is I mean this is what goes on
[47:17.520 --> 47:20.080]  with these people
[47:20.080 --> 47:25.760]  and so when I got there and in the day after I was on Piers Morgan they had
[47:25.760 --> 47:30.120]  Piers Morgan and two of his guests talk about how how I need to be shot and
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.160]  killed and how and how Piers Morgan will dress up in a uniform to do it I mean
[47:34.160 --> 47:38.520]  only a criminal psychology would come up with that yes you'll wear a uniform he's
[47:38.520 --> 47:44.960]  like yes I'll put on a uniform when I do it and you know it's the model you know
[47:44.960 --> 47:51.760]  daughter of the ambassador Huntsman along with the Daily Beast writer and
[47:51.760 --> 47:56.320]  Piers Morgan a Buzz Bissinger talking about you'll wear uniforms you do it
[47:56.320 --> 48:01.080]  yeah yeah I mean folks when you know criminology it's like whoa whoa
[48:01.080 --> 48:05.160]  fantasizing about dressing up in uniform see it's the state's their power they
[48:05.160 --> 48:10.320]  they step into the state and then it gives them all this power
[48:10.320 --> 48:15.880]  and then we found another clip that's up at infowars.com a Paul Watson article
[48:15.880 --> 48:20.960]  Piers Morgan used machine guns to take out critics and and then we get the
[48:20.960 --> 48:26.680]  weatherman videos and this was confirmed in federal court and many of them pled
[48:26.680 --> 48:30.720]  guilty to this they're in meetings saying we're gonna take over put 50
[48:30.720 --> 48:35.520]  million in camps kill 25 mil and they lick their stinking lips folks these are
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.560]  these are psychopaths these are fantasy killers because they're weak
[48:40.840 --> 48:45.560]  these people are sheltered sheltered it's been proven historically and Victor
[48:45.560 --> 48:50.640]  Hugo wrote about it prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men he actually
[48:50.640 --> 48:55.440]  said adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters I flip his quote and it's
[48:55.440 --> 49:00.440]  true these people that's why cultures like Rome at the end where the Emperor's
[49:00.440 --> 49:04.080]  were so decadent and disconnected from reality we're like kill him kill them
[49:04.080 --> 49:08.600]  you know kill kill kill because they're just spoiled brats and to them it's real
[49:08.600 --> 49:13.000]  sexy to talk about killing somebody that's why elites always get so decadent
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.960]  and sick so here's Piers Piers Morgan the first time talking about how they
[49:16.960 --> 49:21.160]  want to kill me and then we found a new clip how they want to kill all of us see
[49:21.160 --> 49:24.440]  they want to kill you you have to understand they want to kill you in the
[49:24.440 --> 49:28.160]  rape your wife not these people specifically individually but that's
[49:28.160 --> 49:32.280]  where this leads that's what tyrants end up doing here it is but what do you need

[53:07.880 --> 53:13.880]  2010 then I learned about RNA drops I learned that 97% of my DNA that
[53:13.880 --> 53:17.920]  scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches
[53:17.920 --> 53:22.320]  that play a critical role in controlling how my cells organs and other tissues
[53:22.320 --> 53:26.280]  behave I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've
[53:26.280 --> 53:31.440]  been conditioned to believe I began taking RNA drops a 100% natural formula

[55:06.600 --> 55:10.840]  and a man's gonna do what a man's got to do
[55:10.840 --> 55:15.080]  look here's the bottom line folks if you act like a nation of sheep if you act
[55:15.080 --> 55:20.440]  like a nation cowering the government even if there's good people in government
[55:20.440 --> 55:25.280]  they will be replaced by people looking to dominate sheep and that process has
[55:25.280 --> 55:28.960]  been going on that's why great nations that had a lot of freedom it takes a
[55:28.960 --> 55:33.120]  long time for them to get rid of the old culture of freedom the old culture of
[55:33.120 --> 55:38.120]  being honorable and again if I could give a brain transplant or like a Vulcan
[55:38.120 --> 55:42.480]  mind-meld with all Americans or all people in the world and just let them
[55:42.480 --> 55:48.960]  see what I've seen like the new Star Trek movie that came
[55:48.960 --> 55:54.320]  out if I could just say here here's what I just saw and have you see all the
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.560]  quotes and all the things and them grab in my arm and hey what's going on we're
[55:57.560 --> 56:00.600]  gonna kill you and we take over you know that the first time it happens you're
[56:00.600 --> 56:03.960]  like man who are you I'm with them and we're taking over soon and I'll be our
[56:03.960 --> 56:08.720]  time it's always some weird little wimp who would never face you except they've
[56:08.720 --> 56:13.680]  got the cops there from the special unit not the general cops with the special
[56:13.680 --> 56:18.240]  event unit ready to set you up their power is because they're a gang of
[56:18.240 --> 56:22.680]  bullies lined up and then you go to the next event they come over and tell you
[56:22.680 --> 56:25.840]  they're gonna kill you and I've even caught it on tape where the communists
[56:25.840 --> 56:32.640]  are in New York and they say we're gonna kill you it's in my film martial law and
[56:32.640 --> 56:35.880]  I'm like you're gonna kill me they're like yeah we're gonna we're gonna kill

[56:44.280 --> 56:48.800]  probably 15 times I've had him tell me in person they're gonna kill me and then
[56:48.800 --> 56:52.880]  and then now they get on the news and say they're going to kill me I hope his
[56:52.880 --> 56:57.840]  kids don't get killed hope he didn't get that call some night and piers they cut
[56:57.840 --> 57:03.280]  to piers and he goes yes and I'm like oh that body language didn't look good I

[57:58.080 --> 58:03.640]  they killed 50% the NKVD documents were declassified a few decades ago they'd
[58:03.640 --> 58:07.440]  say sir we've killed about half the population shit the other quarter to
[58:07.440 --> 58:12.000]  gulag slave labor thousand miles away there's only a small percentage of
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.920]  people left now and we need them to basically supply us with food and then

[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:40.160]  trip to the high mountains high mountain desert of southwest Texas just never had
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:49.120]  a place energized me like that absolute food for the soul I do intend to take
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.600]  phone calls and we'll do that when max Kaiser's on with us in the third hour
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:57.040]  today popping in for one segment I just had to
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:04.200]  have him on he heads up the US Small Business Association Obama proposes to
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.080]  close the Small Business Administration as predicted so they already illegally
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.320]  don't do everything they can to not give government contracts to small businesses
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.920]  and have a secret blacklist that he sued and exposed now they're just getting rid
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.120]  of it period because they don't want anybody getting together and
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:24.160]  communicating the giant screw job that's happening and here's an example not a
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:28.600]  small business but big heavy industrial twenty two billion dollars was paid to
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.600]  your taxpayer money to ship General Motors to South America China and Eastern
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.920]  Europe and again it's not gonna help the Chinese and Eastern Europeans or the
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.080]  Brazilians I'm not against them getting jobs because they ship it there to
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.800]  actually lower the wages there and drag ours down it's a globalist plan it's
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.560]  cold-blooded it's economic domination and see that's why they all push oh like
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.680]  in World War Z the book how the great South African plan was that you know
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.740]  just let the general public be killed and how cold-blooded and beautiful it
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.800]  was and how not being human is so great and how being cold-blooded let me tell
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.280]  you these globalists want you to be cold-blooded they actually are
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.000]  hot-blooded and enjoy hurting people and they actually care about their kids
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  listen I'm not gonna lay over and die so a bunch of hunchback buck-toothed bug
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.560]  eyed inbred New World Order trash can have their way okay you people are
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:23.560]  cancer and I declare info war on you and set my full will and my name and my life
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:30.080]  and my soul on the altar of God and God recognizes that God gave us all power
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.080]  we're just not using our power against the New World Order and greater he that
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:41.240]  is in me than he that is in the world and in the only reason we had all this
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.600]  liberty and all this wealth was because we were evil compared to other countries
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:53.320]  we were more god-fearing America was the best the West is the best what developed
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.800]  here what happened is the greatest expression of human liberty with all its
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.880]  warts and all its pot marks and all its problems and that's why the New World
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.080]  Order seeks to expunge that and they send their horsemen their minions like
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.280]  this piers morgan with his minions talking about shooting me here it is but
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.120]  what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for the only reason I think you need it
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.920]  is Pierce challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match show up with a

[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.000]  fathers defending the Republic defending our country from the grave premiering

[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:45.360]  folks here is this amazing special report the Second Amendment to the
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:50.240]  Constitution a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.160]  free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.200]  infringed shall not be infringed shall not be infringed shall not be infringed
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:04.880]  shall not be infringed the founding fathers agree armed citizens make good
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:10.880]  government I asked her what is the militia it is the whole people who is
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.000]  the militia are they not ourselves to disarm the people that is the best and
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.800]  most effective way to enslave them George Mason Congress have no power to
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.080]  disarm the militia their swords and every other terrible implement of the
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:32.280]  soldier are the birthright of an American tench Cox 1788 the
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.920]  Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:40.920]  the people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:46.200]  trust the people with arms James Madison a federalist number 46 a free people
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.120]  ought not only to be armed and disciplined but they should have
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.480]  sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.240]  any who might attempt to abuse them which would include their own government
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:02.200]  George Washington the founding fathers created the Bill of Rights enshrined
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:06.200]  individual protections including the Second Amendment because they
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:10.840]  understood that power inherently corrupts the Bill of Rights was set up
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.400]  to try to discourage bad behavior from government try to further restrain it
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:20.120]  and try to head off what they knew would eventually become misinterpretations of
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.800]  the law and attempts to misconstrue the intent of the founders but their quotes
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.160]  here cannot be more clear if the representatives of the people betray
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:34.320]  their constituents there is then no recourse left but in the exertion of
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.520]  that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.440]  of government Alexander Hamilton the Federalist number 28 are we at last
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.640]  brought to such a humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.640]  trusted with arms for our own defense Patrick Henry the Constitution shall
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.920]  never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:03.200]  States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms Samuel Adams the
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.560]  right of citizens to bear arms is just one more guarantee against arbitrary
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.920]  government one more safeguard against the tyranny which now appears remote in
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.760]  America but which historically has proved to be always possible
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:22.240]  Hubert Humphrey 1960 when governments fear the people there is Liberty when
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:26.200]  the people fear the government there is tyranny the strongest reason for the
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.760]  people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:37.520]  themselves against tyranny in government Thomas Jefferson the best we can hope
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.760]  for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed Alexander
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.760]  Hamilton the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.960]  restrains evil interference they deserve a place of honor with all that is good
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:56.720]  George Washington arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.040]  and preserve order in the world as well as property forad mischief would ensue
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.640]  were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them Thomas Paine to preserve Liberty
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:11.520]  it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:18.480]  taught alike especially when young how to use them Richard Henry Lee 1778 a
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.760]  free people claim their rights as derived from the laws of nature and not
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:27.760]  as a gift of their chief magistrate Thomas Jefferson our Second Amendment
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.560]  our free speech our gifts from God but the fact that they were pointed out
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.840]  highlighted enumerated and strengthened in the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.160]  is our birthright you don't have to like guns you don't have to like the Second
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:44.360]  Amendment to fight for it to stand up for it if we let it slip away we're
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.000]  going to lose everything from free speech on down that light will be dimmed
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.920]  if we allow them to encroach on the Second Amendment guard with jealous
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:57.200]  attention the public liberty suspect everyone who approaches that jewel
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.720]  unfortunately nothing will preserve it but downright force wherever you give up
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.800]  that force you are ruined the great object is that every man be armed
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:12.920]  everyone who is able might have a gun Patrick Henry dictators and disarmed
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:18.180]  populations go together the most foolish mistake we can possibly make would be to
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:23.400]  allow the subject races to possess arms history shows that all conquerors who
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.680]  have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:34.280]  downfall by doing so Adolf Hitler April 1942 before standing army can rule the
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.320]  people must be disarmed as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe Noah
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:46.520]  Webster death solves all problems no man no problem Joseph Stalin in earlier
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:52.360]  times it was easier to control 1 million people than to physically kill 1 million
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:59.000]  people today it is infinitely easier to kill 1 million people than to control 1
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.960]  million people Zignu Brzezinski if the opposition disarms well and good if it
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:10.340]  refuses to disarm we shall disarm it ourselves Joseph Stalin one death is a
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:16.680]  tragedy 1 million is a statistic Joseph Stalin to disarm the people is the best
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:21.960]  and most effective way to enslave them George Mason and tyranny always follows
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.120]  disarm populations it's the history of democide it's what naturally happens
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:31.320]  when power is too concentrated in one man in one centralized government in one
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.480]  tyrannical system as we now see worldwide we were supposed to set up
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.040]  checks and balances in an attempt to create better government instead we let
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:44.200]  our guard down and the corporations have taken over it is the duty of the Patriot
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.560]  to protect his country from its government Thomas Paine the supreme
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.320]  power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:58.800]  of the people are armed you know Webster 1787 ideas are more powerful than guns
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.760]  we would not let our enemies have guns why should we let them have ideas Joseph
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.200]  Stalin those now possessing weapons and ammunition are at once to turn them over
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.360]  to the local police authority firearms and ammunition found in a Jews
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.680]  possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation whoever
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.040]  willfully or negligently violates the provisions will be punished with
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.640]  imprisonment and a fine Nazi law regulations against Jews possession of
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:31.160]  weapons 1938 political power grows out of the barrel of a gun chairman Mao
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:37.080]  Zedong the only real power comes out of a long rifle Joseph Stalin those who
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.840]  beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for those who
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.560]  didn't Ben Franklin if gun laws in fact worked the sponsors of this type of
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.840]  legislation should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.880]  crime rates reduced by such legislation that they cannot do so after a century
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.560]  and a half of trying but they must sweep under the rug the southern attempts at
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:04.520]  gun control in the 1870 to 1910 period the northeastern attempts in the 1920 to
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:11.320]  1939 period the attempts at both federal and state levels in 1965 through 1976
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:16.240]  establishes the repeated complete and inevitable failure of gun laws to
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.000]  control serious crime or in hatch and the right to keep and bear arms after a
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.960]  shooting spree they always want to take guns away from the people who didn't do
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:29.160]  it I sure as hell wouldn't want to live in a society where the only people
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:33.600]  allowed guns are the police and military William S burrows they've undermined our
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:37.160]  economic system they've instituted the Federal Reserve they bought out
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:41.440]  politicians and now they're coming for the final restraint on their total power
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:46.000]  that is firearms that is guns that is the Second Amendment and if you let them
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.200]  do it they're going to encroach on our entire lives if you want the right to
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:54.520]  control your own life to pursue life liberty and the pursuit of happiness you
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:59.040]  must politically stand up for the Second Amendment and say no to these attempts
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.560]  to use emotional strings the images of dead children okay folks that's only
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.000]  part of the report there's like two three minutes left it just went up in

[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.480]  the design implosion of our economy and some people say well give us some
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:41.920]  positiveness if people are destroying the economy by design I'm gonna explain
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.280]  this to the next segment the good news is there's a way to fix it it'd be kind

[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:58.920]  out there till the person comes to stab holes in the tires admitting that
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:04.920]  someone's doing it is positive it means that we can fix our economy and I'm
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:09.760]  going to explain that coming up in the next segment and tie it into Phil
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.200]  Mickelson warns of drastic changes because of state of federal tax
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:18.280]  situation we've got Americans fleeing Hawaii fleeing California fleeing New
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:26.240]  York fleeing other high tax zones to places like Texas so that is coming up
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:31.480]  right now let's go to a clip from Obama's coronation yesterday on the
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:37.360]  Second Amendment and more through it all we have never relinquished our
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:43.160]  skepticism of central authority nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:49.960]  society's ills can be cured through government alone our celebration of
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:55.800]  initiative and enterprise our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:03.320]  these are constants in our character we have always understood that when times
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:10.240]  change so must we that fidelity to our founding principles requires new
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:16.200]  responses to new challenges the preserving our individual freedoms
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:22.800]  ultimately requires collective action for the American people can no more meet
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.760]  the demands of today's world by acting alone than American soldiers could have
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.880]  met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militia that's global
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.960]  government no single person can train all the math and science teachers will
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:40.760]  need to equip our children pause back it up back in about 20 seconds I want to
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:45.920]  hear that musket part again they cut to the military shots of the military and
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:51.080]  then they say militias and muskets the message is you can't protect us really
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.840]  the muskets in the militia are to protect us from you the founders are
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.400]  clear I just played clips that are on record of what they said and they try to
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:03.160]  take the guns over and over again and now they've set up a paradigm where if
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:08.360]  you don't give your guns up you're causing more children to die when the
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:12.720]  government has made it gun free zones advertise it's a new thing to do go kill
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:18.640]  kids and put people on drugs that on record gives them a compulsion to go out
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.720]  and engage in mass murder while they advertise oh you're being given pills
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.960]  that make you psychotic now we're going to push this let's go to this clip meet
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.920]  the demands of today's world by acting alone than American soldiers could have
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:37.600]  met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias no single
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:41.000]  person can train all the math and science teachers will need to equip our
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.040]  children that's enough of it or build the roads and networks and research labs
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.400]  that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores it's more you didn't build
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:57.520]  it garbage now more than ever we must do these things together as one nation
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:05.480]  total communism that's enough now again if he came out and said we need to
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.400]  collectively get behind the Bill of Rights and Constitution to empower
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:14.320]  individualism you see because there is a collective of liberty but where the
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.240]  individual is strong and makes the whole greater that's not their system the
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.360]  collective is strong the individual needs to be weak it's the devil's
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:27.120]  counterfeit and then meanwhile here's the key to all this we're going to come
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.280]  back and break this down they're saying we know things are tough come together
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.760]  and we'll get out of this and that's what they have the clergy response team
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:40.720]  manuals say and we've seen clergy on TV talk about where they're told they're in
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.800]  the crisis take the shot go to the FEMA camp do what you're told we'll get out
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:48.400]  of this do what you're told we'll get you out of this collapsed mine do what
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.960]  you're told the economy will come back turn your guns in things will get better
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:56.920]  give us a third bailout grease and we'll turn the lights back on things only got
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:02.500]  worse it's false hope it is a program where they implode things offer the
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:06.680]  solution that's more government things implode more offer the solution more
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.120]  government things implode more offer the solution more government things implode
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:16.360]  more offer the solution more government and then they are exempt from the laws
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.800]  and regulations and taxes so what happens they set up a system where you
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:27.400]  can't operate and only they can it's called monopoly tyranny very cold blood
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.920]  and they all write white papers and talk about it in agenda 21 and how they're
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.800]  gonna shut everything off while going things are getting bad it's come
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:39.920]  together behind me I'll fix them you see how cold-blooded that is while

[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:42.560]  get into a subject like this because I want to hit you with a thousand data
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:50.040]  points but our guest is holding waiting to cover the latest incredible outrage
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:58.880]  that the system is pushing but Obama is looking to get rid of the u.s. small
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:04.360]  business administration and consolidated basically in under Homeland Security
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:09.360]  just the overall Gestapo and he's selling it like hey you want to get rid
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:14.000]  of federal agencies I will get rid of it now here's the issue you're supposed to
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.640]  have him and our guests will give you all the numbers the majority of money
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:22.960]  taxpayer money when it is federal dollars is supposed to go back to small
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:28.960]  and local businesses so that at least the argument is if 30 40 percent of our
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:34.800]  money is going to the feds it'll come back but that there's got to be a bid
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:40.160]  competition to ensure that we don't get ripped off and then that way if we're
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:43.400]  going to have a big government system at least our own tax money comes flowing
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:48.560]  back to then build up of the economy now the problem with that always is big
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.200]  government is going to end up having special interests mainly globalists come
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:55.480]  in and pay them off and it's come out in the last few years he's filed dozens of
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.440]  lawsuits dozens and dozens on the subject we'll get the actual numbers I
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:06.840]  know it's a lot from him from our guest to to not let small businesses get any
[01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.720]  of the money in fact most of them it turns out are foreigners and when the
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:14.000]  public wakes up to this they go hey you're right there shouldn't be no bid
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.840]  contracts for French companies no no this is even American companies that
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:24.760]  aren't even allowed to bid in the case of what we saw in Iraq is is that they
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:31.320]  spun it as oh yeah you know it's no bid contracts for national security but
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:36.400]  turned out it was foreign companies the point is there's just so many angles to
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.840]  all of this it makes my head spin and you've seen some of the most famous
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:47.080]  actors and soccer players in France leaving because they have a 75% income
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:53.360]  tax and then on top of that any money that you get to keep over a million
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:41:00.160]  euros another 75% tax in fact some people pay over 80% but 75 is what most
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.160]  of the high-income earners pay so what's 75 and then 75 on top of that you have
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:09.400]  25% left and you take 75 from that not counting all the local taxes I'm you're
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:14.240]  talking about not even 10% of your money you keep and and by the way Obama has
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.560]  hired the big French top economists to help run international and domestic
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:23.320]  systems that was in the news two weeks ago and they're calling her this genius
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.840]  oh it's so genius to have everybody basically working for the government and
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.960]  then that gives them total control over society well here's a new article out of
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:39.640]  Yahoo Sports Phil Mickelson warns of drastic changes because of state federal
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:44.480]  tax situation if you add up all the federal and you look at the disability
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:49.000]  and the unemployment the Social Security and the state my tax rate is 62 63
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.440]  percent he said so I've got to make some decisions on what I'm going to do there
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:57.840]  are going to be some drastic changes for me because I happen to be in the zone
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:01.280]  that has been targeted both federally and by the state and you know it doesn't
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.720]  work for me now he added so I'm going to have to make some changes and is saying
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.760]  he may leave and take his business out of California the great exodus so the
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:16.160]  globalists say that they need a global government show that you can't escape
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:20.520]  them but then they at the global level they're exempt just like EU bureaucrats
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:27.040]  are totally exempt from federal EU taxes but they have the head of the EU
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.920]  bureaucrats the head of the IMF what's the La Grande Lagarde I always
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.320]  mispronounce it she comes out member and says the Greeks aren't paying enough
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:41.080]  taxes on average over 60% and then Howard Dean comes out and says poor
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:43.440]  people need to pay more well guess what they are now
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:47.200]  payroll taxes kicked in how you like that 3.8% on top of the 10% you were
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.320]  paying that's almost 14% right there okay that's enough I'm gonna go to our
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:43:00.120]  guest here and he joins us and guys I had the article here it is press release
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:04.160]  Obama proposes to close the Small Business Administration as predicted
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:10.400]  October 31st 2012 that's when that first came out well now he's back with it that
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:13.600]  he's been sworn in so they've been predicting it since then and now
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.840]  they're moving ahead with it Lloyd Chapman a frequent guest I don't have
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:21.840]  more time for him here today and I appreciate him joining us ASBL.com he
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:27.280]  joins us he's a private group who's been successfully lobbying for millions of
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.960]  small businesses and he's the biggest small business organization outside of
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.840]  the Better Business Bureau and a few others in the Chamber of Commerce and
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:39.320]  he's been exposing how they do everything they can to make sure small
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.080]  businesses cannot get one dollar and it's and it's illegal what's happening
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:48.200]  so now Obama wants no oversight and no group period to even dispense it okay so
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:52.400]  Lloyd Chapman born and raised in Texas he began his career working of course
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.740]  for Bob Bullock famous Democrat spent eight years the Texas Comptroller's
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:59.640]  Office before moving to California to enter the computer industry and I'm not
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:03.520]  going to go through how he launched successful technology firms and things
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:07.800]  like that and how he was involved in congressional intervention and
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.120]  investigations of f-22 stealth fighters and things like that he's gotten a lot
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:18.060]  done how many lawsuits have you filed total oh probably about 40 40 so I said
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:22.080]  dozens and dozens that was accurate okay I burn most the time here we got two
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:26.280]  segments left run through what we're facing and what this means all right
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:30.140]  well I like to I like to talk about the facts I'm trying to be persuasive so
[01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:34.480]  according to the US Census Bureau small business in America responsible for over
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:39.800]  90% of the net new jobs half the gross domestic product half the private sector
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:44.240]  workforce and over 90% of all u.s. exporters so if you want to create jobs
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.080]  you've got to do it through small businesses the Coppin Foundation at a
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:53.800]  study a couple years ago that said small businesses have created 100% of the net
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:58.560]  new job since 1980 that means fortune 1000 firms haven't created one net new
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:02.840]  job in over 30 years so small businesses of a heart and soul of our nation's
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:07.240]  economy there's one agency in Washington to help the small businesses that's the
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:11.200]  Small Business Administration it's actually fairly small agency there's 28
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.400]  million small businesses and Barack Obama is gonna try to close it which
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:21.720]  would be economic suicide and I'm trying to stop him and I don't know why he
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.920]  wants to close it I I guess the only reason he wants to close it is to cover
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.320]  up the fraud and abuse that's going on during his administration I know if you
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:32.480]  saw the story but the New York Times in a story of a couple of months ago if the
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:39.040]  Obama ministration gave 900 over 900 million in US government small business
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.760]  contracts to a Russian-owned international arms dealer called rose
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:48.800]  born exports that's the type of thing that Barack Obama's doing and there's
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.120]  been a number of federal investigation yes we did see that that was huge news
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:57.200]  and that's only the tip of the iceberg absolutely the Inspector General for the
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:01.360]  Small Business Administration that he appointed has stated every year of his
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.160]  administration the number one challenge at the Small Business Administration is
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:09.640]  the diversion of federal small business contracts to large corporations and
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:15.080]  they've named it one of the largest challenges facing the entire country so
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.700]  I think Obama's gonna try to close the SBA by combining it with probably the
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:22.440]  Commerce Department and it's just an attempt on his part to cover up the
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:26.000]  rampant fraud abuse and it's going to be devastating to our economy if he's
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.440]  successful and I hope people will join us in fighting the Obama administration
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:37.440]  to save the only agency to help the middle class and as usual mr. Chapman
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:42.600]  there's all this spin that is involved at so many levels to this where Obama's
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:47.600]  selling it like I'm gonna get rid of waste I'm gonna get rid of a bad agency
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:51.760]  and I'm gonna cut government but really this is the agency that makes sure
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:57.880]  federal funds actually go to real US companies and ie small ones absolutely
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:01.920]  federal law says a minimum of twenty three percent of the total value of all
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:04.920]  federal contract should go to small businesses I don't think there's a
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:09.480]  better way to invest our tax dollars in then to reinvest back into the companies
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:13.200]  that create all the jobs companies were most Americans work and he wants to get
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.000]  rid of that he says he's gonna save three hundred million dollars a year in
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.840]  the federal budget that's that's peanuts the Pentagon misplaces hundreds of
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:27.160]  billions to put it into perspective he says he's gonna close the SBA to save
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:31.680]  three hundred million a year it is gonna increase foreign aid by nine billion a
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.080]  year that would be enough to do two things put an armed guard at every
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:40.600]  school in America are run the SBA for a decade so his story about closing the
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:45.240]  SBA to say three million a year is just ridiculous it's not believable and again
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:51.680]  Lloyd Chapman joins us he is the head of the ASBL American Small Business League
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.960]  really the only group out there kind of like Gunners of America that's that's
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.440]  that's medium-sized and really fighting hard you know you're a nice guy and you
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:03.240]  you're not a psychopath you're not a sociopath you're not a control freak so
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.640]  you go I don't know why he's doing this well you know I mean you've helped break
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.200]  it in the national news a few years ago where they create secret black lists for
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.520]  small businesses where they're taking the majority the money and giving it not
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.520]  just a mega corporations but foreign corporations he paid 22 billion of the
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.120]  bailout money to General Motors to ship it to China vault Cadillac and and other
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:27.840]  factories some others went to Brazil others Eastern Europe they're doing
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.920]  everything they can we went from 25 million on food stamps to 49 million his
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:35.360]  first four years they want us dependent they're globalists it's agenda 21
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:39.080]  California knows when they raise taxes it's gonna kill the state I mean they
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:43.080]  know what they're doing they want us bankrupt it's cold-blooded they want to
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:47.440]  destroy this country they want to break us to bring us into collectivism they're
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.600]  doing this period in fact what's the percentage I saw in the Wall Street
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.500]  Journal in a report talking about you like a year ago how much of the small
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:49:01.440]  business contracts actually goes to multinationals oh probably maybe half
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.600]  and then total goes to big companies that's supposed to be going to small
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:10.200]  ones right I mean I mean obviously if you're gonna have you know trillions of
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.840]  dollars the federal government it better come back into America at least that
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.440]  creates some jobs it gives them still control but I mean they're killing their
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:23.200]  own golden goose here absolutely the Small Business Act is the most efficient
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:27.480]  effective economic stimulus program in the history of America if Barack Obama
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:31.480]  would simply quit giving federal small business contracts to fortune 500 firms
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:36.400]  that not only are not creating jobs but shipping jobs overseas it would create
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:40.160]  more jobs do more to boost the economy anything here President Bush ever spoke
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.720]  of it's so simple he could do one executive order would take him five
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.680]  minutes and just says a federal government would no longer report awards
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:50.080]  to publicly traded companies or foreign-owned companies as small
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:56.320]  business awards it would put as much as 200 billion a year an existing federal
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.240]  infrastructure spinning back into the middle class but he's not going to do
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:07.840]  that and he's going to destroy our economy there there's no logic behind
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.640]  taking federal funds about largely going to the the middle class where most
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.160]  people work and all the jobs are created and giving it to foreign-owned companies
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:20.880]  that there's there's no way to justify totally illegal I mean again I kind of
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:24.280]  bumbled it earlier we're going to break gonna come back and continue along this
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:28.320]  but you know the point is the the no bid contracts came out in Iraq hundreds of
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.680]  billions of dollars something was over a trillion total trillion seven like the
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.160]  whole thing and still going but they're sitting there saying oh you know be
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:40.680]  quiet we've got to have no bids for national security for American companies
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:45.040]  it was foreign companies getting in a no bid I mean it's even worse but to the
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:48.400]  general public oh we got to do it for national security for American companies
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:52.440]  it's foreign companies I mean ladies and gentlemen the foreign companies come in
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:57.000]  and lobby to take your tax money out of the country this is how we've been
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.320]  occupied and conquered this is economic espionage if you've ever wanted one of
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.280]  our best-selling generators but we're waiting for an offer so crazy you
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:09.400]  couldn't refuse then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:14.400]  here's why our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power and unlike
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:18.840]  gas generators solar generators run quietly emit no fumes and produce
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:22.960]  electricity from the Sun so when the lights go out you'll always have the
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:27.600]  power you need now here's the best part every year we accumulate a few solar
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:32.480]  generators that we just can't sell as new we put them in a special spot in our
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.760]  warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of each year we call them
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:40.960]  scratch and dead units but they're really just like new each unit comes
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:45.480]  with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe don't
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:49.800]  wait they go fast go to scratch and then solar calm that scratch and then solar
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:55.440]  calm for the craziest offer we've ever made go to scratch and then solar calm
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:59.680]  that scratch and then solar calm
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:06.440]  hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:12.440]  wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts warn
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:17.600]  that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known in fact just a
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:20.880]  few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:25.080]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:28.880]  that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.000]  the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a free
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.600]  video at weird device calm that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the

[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:19.280]  We got our guest a little bit into the next hour the Max Kaiser is joining us
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:24.680]  on the economic front and a lot more
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:30.640]  this video this is breaking news I haven't seen by pointed out TSA groped
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:35.440]  attendees at Obama inauguration and and they searched them they groped their
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:39.760]  genitals and they did the the full frisk because you're a criminal government is
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:45.320]  God you are bad and then you see people like Saddam Hussein and others they can
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:49.060]  stand around with everybody thousands of people firing machine guns in the air no
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:53.800]  one shoots them but but our supposed free leaders and again the globalists
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.280]  selected who could run they put the billions of dollars in to put who they
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:01.780]  wanted in both guys basically wanted the same thing one just paid lip service to
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:05.960]  you did build that the other didn't
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:09.560]  Romney was a placeholder
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:14.080]  and now we're seeing the fruits of it so I'm gonna do a report this week that
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.720]  Obama why Obama really is a dictator that is his office has become a
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:23.340]  manufactured synthetic presidency and the only word for that is dictatorship
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:27.840]  and he's acting dictatorial with all these edicts again normally I say get
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.000]  rid of the Department of Education get rid of all these groups because we
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.200]  shouldn't have them running our local schools we should have taxes cut keep
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:40.360]  the taxes in the state but I've got to say because the law plugs in to the
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:45.480]  Small Business Administration it's designed to make sure the money does go
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:51.280]  to the lowest bid contractor who has a good track record in the 50 states not
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.720]  to foreign globalist so what will Obama's trying to shut this
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:05.700]  administration down do you know when when you're talking about Obama there's
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:09.560]  been a number of federal investigations during his administration and I'm just
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:14.920]  reading these these reports and all the reports say that his administration is
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:18.320]  diverting these federal funds and by law should be going to the middle class for
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:23.280]  some of the biggest companies in the world you know Lockheed Boeing north north
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:30.720]  of Raytheon Finn mechanic in Italy rose born in Russia companies and in South
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:34.960]  Korea so it's just it's just a tragedy if you really want to know who Barack
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:40.480]  Obama is he's he's a man in the middle of the worst economic downturn in 80
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:44.720]  years when the statistics show irrefutably that small businesses create
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:49.600]  between 99 percent of jobs he's doing everything he can to take that money and
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:54.280]  divert it to the large businesses that most likely have created one job in 30
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:58.880]  years and the law says he can't do that and remember the law he's breaking the
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:03.520]  law to do that and the corporate whore media is barely starting to cover it I
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.380]  want to warn everybody that works for the system you're not going to have a
[01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:10.520]  country anymore if you don't stop things like this the reason we have you on five
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:14.180]  or six times a year mr. Chapman is because what you're saying is a real
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:20.440]  solution have the money go back to America it is a no-brainer it there
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:24.280]  there's no logic I would love to have anybody in the country of Obama's
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:29.060]  biggest supporter explain to me you know how it's good for America to take our
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:33.880]  tax dollars that by law should be going to American companies and giving it to a
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:37.400]  Russian-owned international arms dealer are some of the biggest companies in
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:42.880]  Europe and Asia there there's no way to to to explain that by the way are you
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:46.200]  are you familiar with Obama's Jobs Council I saw a story about that the
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:49.960]  everyday tell folks about that oh well Obama's got a Jobs Council of all
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:54.600]  fortune 500 firms now according to again the US Census Bureau and the Kauffman
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:58:00.320]  Foundation it doesn't look like fortune 500 firms have created one job in 30
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:05.240]  years and that's who Obama's Jobs Council the president was ahead of GE
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:10.120]  GE is shipping more American jobs overseas the other company so it's
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.600]  insane in a clear in the aggregate and then those are cut numbers is actually
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:18.640]  worse we're losing jobs but in the aggregate not one new job from fortune
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:24.280]  500 almost what is it 97% are made by the small businesses and then meanwhile
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:27.080]  but see that's what he does oh we don't have 50 states anymore we have a
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:31.240]  governor's council I appoint oh we don't have local counties anymore we have a
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:36.080]  rural council I created that's what he does he creates a counterfeit that then
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:42.560]  is represented by the globalist we'll be back stay with us you are listening to

[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:36.400]  Chapman is our guest right now with the ASBL.com American Small Business League
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:44.840]  the globalists are getting rid of all the agencies not the bureaucrats but the
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:48.840]  command structure in the mandate because these agencies are mandated by law if
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:53.320]  Obama creates a new agency it's still illegal but somehow he can put new
[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.240]  people in who will just do whatever he says because bureaucrats have got
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:00:59.880]  problems but a lot of them are like yeah in fact in all their studies are like
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:02.680]  yeah this is supposed to go to local businesses US businesses small
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:07.640]  businesses it's not happening and so they don't even like their own agencies
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:12.600]  so just get rid of it because you know as bad as some bureaucrats are they're
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:18.960]  basically committing suicide politically and economically there's some other
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:24.960]  breaking news up at infowars.com that is so incredible so incredible video

[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:26.920]  more likely to die from a lightning strike than they are in school a
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:34.600]  thousand kids a year commit suicide more kids are killed by bee stings then guns
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:39.400]  in schools and about the same number of children are killed by dogs every year
[02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:44.120]  as they are guns in schools guns in schools are not a problem children being
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:49.240]  killed by guns in school is not in the top ten reasons children die three
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.440]  thousand children a year die from head injuries riding their bicycles so when
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.720]  you talk about these average over the last decade of 21 children you're being
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.160]  killed in schools it's statistically insignificant it's not even in the top
[02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:08.880]  ten reasons on the Piers Morgan show you mentioned 11,000 people in America killed
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:16.360]  by gun violence ten times as many people in America die from the known side
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:23.160]  effects of properly prescribed and properly taken pharmaceutical drugs ten
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:27.240]  times as many people it's a total fear-mongering hoax manipulating our
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:33.520]  hearts absolutely it's a tragedy that those 20 children got killed but again
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:37.360]  they're more there they're 75 times more likely to be killed by their parents
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:41.760]  they're twice as likely to get struck by lightning so it's it's actually
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:46.280]  statistically insignificant and if anybody like Piers Morgan wants to worry
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:50.080]  about saving children he needs to you know launch a program to protect them
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:55.960]  from these prescription drugs here's the problem they all know this stuff they
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:01.400]  want to disarm us why do they want to disarm us in your view well I think that
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:06.160]  you know when you look at the home of security buying you know 1.8 billion
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:10.680]  rounds of hollow point bullets and urban assault vehicles and surveillance drones
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:15.600]  they got something in mind that we don't know about and they want to disarm us
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.920]  and of course as you've talked about a million times disarming the people's the
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:24.600]  first thing that dictators always have always sent throughout history and it's
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.080]  the opposite the founding fathers one of the founding fathers wanted us to have
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:31.640]  the firepower to overthrow the government if ever if the government
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:35.360]  came oppressive a pierce morgan talks about why do you need assault rifle why
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:38.840]  you need 30 shot clip well when the government stormtroopers start kicking
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:42.560]  in your front door with automatic weapons with 30 shot clips you're gonna
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.280]  want you know an assault rifle 30 shot clip to try to defend you and your

[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:48.560]  get you on about the economy because you know they're buying urban assault
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:53.320]  vehicles 1.6 billion bullets training the army for martial law that's all
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:57.240]  declassified gearing up like it's the end of the world and you believe that by
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:01.360]  the end of April we're gonna see the next phase and implosion we're already
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:07.520]  in an implosion they just use more debt and welfare checks and you know the
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.480]  government little credit cards to keep things going it's a consolidation
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:17.280]  program but now we've seen a bunch of countries the biggest of which Germany
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:22.920]  the key to the EU repatriating their gold saying saying in the news I saw in
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:27.880]  the Financial Times we don't trust the US anymore so even the crux in running
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:32.440]  Germany don't trust the crux over here so are we seeing that creeping towards
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:36.400]  the exits that you've warned about then we'll get into the your take on the
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:41.680]  Second Amendment what's coming up in the economy this African invasion or even
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:45.360]  mainstream news is saying terror in North Africa our Westerners pulling the
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:49.680]  strings of al-qaeda I mean even mainstream news now goes is is NATO in
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:55.040]  the u.s. staging stuff to be able to invade duh duh look at Libya look at
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:00.520]  Syria again joining us max Kaiser max so much is happening I hope that your bold
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:05.000]  prediction is not true but unfortunately it looks like we're creeping towards the
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.280]  eve of financial collapse we'll talk about what that collapse will look like
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:14.680]  as well max Kaiser yeah well nice to be on again and thanks for coming on my
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:21.120]  show and I think you describe it well creeping toward the exits and this is
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:26.840]  what the German gold repatriation story is all about and as you point out the
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:34.000]  central banks have lost trust in each other and they are taking their gold out
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.880]  of banks in respective vaults around the world and they're bringing it all home
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:46.080]  and they're doing this in a way that will precipitate and accelerate this
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:51.600]  collapse that we've been talking about and to give you an idea for how this all
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:57.440]  works in Britain for example the government says they have 300 tons of
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:02.520]  gold here in Britain but my sources tell me that they have leased out or sold
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:09.480]  over a thousand tons so we have a fractional gold standard around the
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:14.400]  world that is keeping these central banks afloat and now that they all want
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:19.400]  their gold back they find out that the gold's not there back when Germany took
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:26.760]  900 tons from Britain back during the 2000 2001 period Gordon Brown to
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:32.240]  satisfy Britain's dissatisfied Germany's demand for gold to be sent back in
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:39.120]  Germany at that time he ended up having to sell 400 tons of Britain's gold so
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:43.880]  Britain had to sell 400 tons and that's about over well over a trillion dollars
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:48.360]  now that he gave away because the price of gold at that time was 250 dollars an
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:53.400]  ounce now it's $1,700 an ounce and this is this is a problem going forward the
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:57.040]  Netherlands want their gold Germany wants their gold China's buying gold but
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:00.240]  these central banks that say that they have gold it's turned out that they
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:06.600]  actually leased the gold which is a way for them to to put on their books that
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:10.360]  they still own the gold when when the Fort Knox for example when they lease
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.880]  the gold and they claim that that is as good as owning the gold itself but when
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:19.160]  if you were to audit the Fort Knox you would find that most of the gold has
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:23.800]  been leased and that means sold so when people come then to claim their gold
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:29.120]  they find that it's not there the Bank of New York when Germany it says that
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.080]  they want the gold over seven years well as a panic in the gold market builds
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:37.600]  they're gonna want that gold a lot sooner and they're gonna be told that we
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:41.520]  don't have the gold to give you because we sold it I want to stop you right
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:47.400]  there because something I want to do when we're able to budget in hiring a
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:51.760]  researcher or an archiver is when I have guests on like you I'm gonna have them
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:58.280]  sit there and put the key points you say basically into a scroll at the bottom
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:03.080]  like mainstream television but also put it on a computer so we can search a
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:08.680]  database of when you've been on the radio slash TV show because max at
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:13.720]  nauseum for about two years in almost every interview so there's probably 20
[02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:18.180]  of these you have said that you'll know that it's about to collapse when they
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:24.040]  start demanding gold from Britain and from the US and that they've leveraged
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:28.800]  it at least ten to one in fractional reserve and that it's the fraud of the
[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:32.880]  silver and gold reserves that will finally bring them down and that they
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.320]  want to have a controlled collapse without this happening but that if they
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:40.520]  do go for the gold and silver this way that that's a signal that things are out
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:45.760]  of control now now you've said that over and over and over again and my guests
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:48.640]  through this all the time because we have guests on that are right they could
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:52.320]  have guests on that were right on national TV here in mainstream news but
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.480]  they don't want you to be right they don't want the slaves to know what they
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.280]  know but max you're scaring me because you've said this over and over again
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:04.240]  that this would be the sign and now it's not just Germany demanding the gold from
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:08.040]  the US and England in places this is really scary so you've got the floor
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.760]  till we got a break in five minutes break down how you knew this was coming
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:17.080]  and what this signifies and how you think they'll satisfy at this time it
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:23.560]  started really back in 2008 on March 17th of 2008 Stacy Herbert and I we were
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:27.520]  making a documentary we were in Frankfurt Germany we were at the
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:32.640]  boondis bank and we were talking to people at the boondis bank and this was
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.760]  right when Bear Stearns was collapsing and gold shot up above a thousand
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:43.440]  dollars an ounce and he ended up there at a very historic moment and I asked
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:47.920]  you know I'd like to see the gold and the response from the boondis bank was
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:54.880]  well you know most of it is in New York now that that film was later broadcast
[02:15:54.880 --> 02:16:00.840]  Al Jazeera English and it was a shock to the people in Germany and another
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:05.840]  journalist named Lars Scholl picked it picked up the ball and he's been
[02:16:05.840 --> 02:16:11.080]  hammering journalists and bankers now every year for four years until the
[02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.520]  point where boondis bank came out and said due to the popular pressure we are
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:21.440]  we have have to admit that we have these huge gold positions held in the New York
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.600]  Fed and we're going to now repatriate this gold we're taking the gold back and
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:30.400]  then my sources tell me that the New York Fed said well we don't want you to
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:34.520]  start a run on the gold market so we're gonna space this out over seven years
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:39.240]  and but this was really going back to what we discovered in 2008 which is that
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:43.520]  the gold that these banks say that they have they don't have and this set off a
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:49.080]  fire you know a trigger now over the past four or five years what you have is
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:55.080]  central banks and governments to keep the economies afloat have been
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:17:01.160]  aggressively buying their own bonds they call it quantitative easing and you know
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:04.280]  your other guests talk about this like Gerald Cilenti talks about this a lot
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:09.280]  they buy their own bonds as a way to keep interest rates low or to keep bond
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:13.200]  prices high now here's an amazing statistic the bond price in America has
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:19.560]  not been as high as it is today in the 240 years that America has existed the
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:24.080]  bond price the government bond price in the UK and Britain has not been as high
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:31.560]  since 1694 when the Bank of England was created the bonds are where the dot-com
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:36.600]  was in 2000 it's where the stock market was in 1987 it's where the real estate
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:42.920]  market was in 2005 there it's a historic peak at a bubble peak now whether the
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:48.280]  bonds collapse between now and April as I predicted on your show last year it
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:52.480]  could happen I think it could happen I might be wrong but I won't be wrong by
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:56.520]  much I could be wrong by a few weeks a few months but that's what we're going
[02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:01.520]  to see we're going to see bonds collapse we're gonna see gold now panic buying in
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:06.880]  the gold market taking gold a lot higher and of course it's all ties in to what
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:12.280]  we launched on your show two years ago crash JP Morgan by silver the price of
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:17.320]  silver was around 26 we at that time there was such a furor to buy silver it
[02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:22.240]  moved up to be pulled back now to the low 30s but now we're seeing the price
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:27.040]  of silver after this consolidation period now looks like it's going along
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:30.440]  with gold you're going to see new highs and silver so silver will get over 50
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:34.920]  60 70 dollars an ounce but that's that that those are individuals now who don't
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:38.480]  trust the banking system they're not just governments and for individuals
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:43.360]  they reach for silver because it's a lot easier to get it's cheaper and max the
[02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:48.200]  public here going to break they're all buying survival goods shelters guns
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:53.240]  they're voting with their purchases shelling they don't trust the system the
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:56.720]  elites are all buying armored redoubts and getting bodyguards they don't trust
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:02.520]  the system this looks like quite a mess we're going to enter well there's a good
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:06.840]  point you're making there because it's the to contrast today with the 1930s
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:11.040]  people say this is similar to 1930s there's a big difference between now
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:17.160]  1930s in the 1930s there was a liquidity problem banks needed cash to keep their
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:21.960]  business going for their deposits but today if that's not the problem the
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:28.440]  problem is an insolvency issue these big to failed to too big to fail banks they
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:33.360]  are technically insolvent they're zombie back they're being kept alive with this
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.800]  money printing that they're the politicians tell us what we need to print
[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:40.360]  the money we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the 1930s that's false it's
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:44.560]  not like the 1930s it's not a liquidity issue it's an insolvency issue and
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:48.400]  they're keeping the banks alive with this cheap money and 0% interest rates
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:53.600]  to keep their buddies afloat all right stay there stay there by the way kvue is

[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:22.840]  follow special report for info Wars calm for all the radio listeners as this
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:28.080]  develops at least three people shot at Lone Star College in Houston and and I
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:32.200]  walked out there during the break and CNN's going we're not going to show live
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:39.720]  feeds we'll show selective clips so now oh we're not gonna show live feeds but
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:47.160]  who is is KHOU so we need to go to their website KHOU and KVUE has it so we've
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.200]  now reached the point where CNN will not show you what's happening oh because we
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:55.400]  might see other shooters in camo getting arrested and then we're told oh no the
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:00.200]  five-year-olds saw that we never put that on the news oh you know go back to
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:04.760]  sleep this is an operation Gladio we're not we're not staging something I tell
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.080]  you Max Keiser people can debate you know whether a gun culture is a good
[02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:11.040]  thing or a bad thing when anti-state folks don't like guns we know they're
[02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:14.480]  here to protect us from tyranny but why is the government arming to the teeth
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:18.040]  while rushing to disarm us is it because they don't want us to be armed during
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:25.240]  the collapse I think that's a pretty fair statement the the bond when the
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.160]  bond market collapses as we've talked about because it's a bubble it's in a
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:33.680]  300 year high bubble and I look at what's happening in the markets to give
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:38.600]  me a clue what the big money is doing and I know that JP Morgan over the past
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:44.320]  couple of years has been developing huge positions monopoly like positions and
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:51.880]  food copper industrial metals and in precious metals and they're doing so
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:55.760]  because they know what's coming that hyperinflation is coming and they want
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:59.760]  to be able to totally control that market for example JP Morgan Justin got
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:05.760]  involved in launching an exchange-traded fund for copper so that means and they
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:10.280]  and before they did so they bought something like 20% of the world's copper
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:14.320]  supply so now the price of copper is going to start going up aggressively
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:19.160]  higher because it's being manipulated higher because JP Morgan and the bankers
[02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:22.880]  on Wall Street there will want to make have a new way to make money it's going
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:26.560]  to be on commodities they've made all the money they possibly can over 30
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:30.280]  years in the bond market because the bond market the interest rate under Paul
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:35.080]  Volcker got 15 to 16 percent on the 10-year bond it hit this huge high on the
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:39.360]  interest rate and during the past 30 years now gone down to zero during that
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:43.840]  30-year period was the biggest bull market on Wall Street in history selling
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:49.960]  bonds and bond related equities and stocks and options etc now that 30-year
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:53.760]  period is over and we're going to answer into a period of commodity price
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:58.240]  appreciation JP Morgan already knows it Goldman Sachs already knows it and
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:03.200]  they're buying huge positions into these markets and as far as what's going you
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:08.520]  know in in the US if the price of food gets to a certain level it causes
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:13.440]  riots we know historically that when the price of food gets to around 40% of an
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:18.320]  individual's income you look for a riot that's the point that got to in Egypt
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.200]  before the Egyptians staged a riot revolution in their country and they
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:26.800]  don't want us armed so that we can't protect ourselves but that might
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:30.840]  actually cause total rioting or even the government gets taken down but the
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:35.000]  tyrant's instinct is to disarm us so much they still don't care but
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.200]  historically if they take the general public's guns that will make the
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:43.840]  government even more unstable so in the u.s. the average American spends
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:48.680]  something in the order of 12 to 15 percent of their income on food and
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:54.080]  that's still you know it's not at 40% but as prices now begin to go up
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:58.720]  because of the manipulation coming in the collapse of the bond market and the
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:02.080]  loss of purchasing power from the dollar you're going to get to the point where
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:07.280]  the food costs are going to be out of reach for a very very large percentage
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:11.160]  of the population and so stay there stay there we gotta go to break but I've got
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:16.720]  to play just a minute or so this is kho you and out there on dish Network and
[02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:20.320]  the other cable we've got CNN says they won't show it live we're watching it
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:23.380]  live they don't want you hearing the original eyewitness accounts this is
[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:30.320]  very suspicious turn it up and students are not right yeah correct so basically
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:36.240]  uh this is live at 128 and soon as I heard the bullet the bullets flying
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:41.200]  whatever the gun being you know fired off CNN will not let you see this you
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:46.520]  know that was hit very suspicious so you ran right yeah I ran because uh
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:51.380]  basically here's found that you know out of the ordinary you're gonna run so you
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:54.360]  know that's just again why don't they want people to hear what happened live
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:57.480]  get out the way because I don't want to be a you know victim or anything that's
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:02.080]  a Brittany Mobley she's a student here at Lone Star College on the Northside
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:06.160]  campus you can see there is still plenty of law enforcement activity here on the
[02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:10.360]  scene they are allowing students to leave we're not sure how much
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:13.240]  communication is going on to students other than they're being told that they
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:17.580]  can leave but probably not come back today at are they supposed to get in the
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:21.340]  fetal position as I can tell you look at me a higher death toll the road it's one
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:25.280]  of the entrances off of Aldine Westfield there's another checkpoint all the way
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:28.960]  down back here on the other side tell us how many dead point where we're told
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:33.220]  that some vehicles potentially even all vehicles from students here on this
[02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:37.220]  scene nobody's dead as they leave one officer did tell me I hope this
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:41.620]  intimate mass shooting who are plenty well right back with Max Kaiser stay
[02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:44.960]  with us stay with us at this point you can see this student mass shooting in
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:51.960]  Texas public's not too big oh my gosh that's oh boy we're on the March the
[02:29:51.960 --> 02:30:01.920]  Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network sick of the global
[02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:05.600]  issue Genesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you
[02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:09.880]  get sick and die start purifying your water with pro pure my friends I've done
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:14.560]  a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is pro pure
[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:19.560]  and it's available discounted at info Wars calm its filters are silver and
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:24.680]  pregnant to prevent bacterial growth there's no priming required it's NSF 42
[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:29.880]  certified optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95% easy to set up
[02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:34.640]  and use doesn't require electricity purify water from lakes streams ponds and

[02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:11.440]  GCN radio network
[02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:16.160]  you know why they want only a few globalist controlled national news
[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:19.640]  networks because they want to be able to control the narrative and tell you what
[02:33:19.640 --> 02:33:29.280]  they want we are showing KHOU 11 on screen right now for TV viewers at
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:35.600]  info Wars calm and of course we're doing it via fair use of a news event here in
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:40.000]  our state to document what's happening CNN during the break we've got it
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.200]  recorded we're gonna have a report out on this said quote I just saw it again
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:50.520]  we are not letting you see live feeds because of what you might see and it is
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:54.960]  bodies laying on the ground with paramedics around them looks like from
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:00.000]  helicopter with a shot where you can't even make out of their male or female I
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:04.760]  mean you got shoot-em-up video games mass murder on TV in the 60s they'd show
[02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:09.920]  kids naked running down rice paddy roads with their skin hanging off because
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:15.560]  it was documentary that's why in old radio they would allow cussing only if
[02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:19.240]  it was a real event that happened not because people wanted to hear cussing
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:23.040]  but because you want to hear what really happened for documentary purposes that's
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:26.040]  why when I was a kid I'd watch PBS and they'd have some you know thing about a
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:30.520]  historical event that happened the 50s and there'd be cussing on it because
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:36.560]  it's real so of course we should see whatever this is in 2013 see they tell
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:41.720]  you can see all the simulated torture and murder and death you want in movies
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:45.160]  you name it I just like Time Warner's putting out all these violent movies but
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:50.760]  now saying nobody can advertise guns on any Time Warner magazine TV show cable
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:54.760]  network you name it Max Keiser is our guest he always seems to come on when
[02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:57.560]  there's a big news event this happened like three times the last three times he
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:03.740]  was on Max Keiser syndicated TV host radio host you name it max Keiser calm
[02:35:03.740 --> 02:35:08.440]  max what do you make of this new phenomenon because I've never seen them
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:11.760]  do this where they say oh it's too hurtful what like a little girl has a
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:17.720]  Hello Kitty bubble machine I actually bought these for my kids you pull the
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:21.080]  trigger and you stick it it's not even meant to be a quote gun it's a thing to
[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:24.740]  hold and put bubbles a little pink Hello Kitty deal and the police came and
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:28.940]  grabbed the little girl because a bubble things she had kids are being arrest for
[02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:33.200]  nerf guns that are orange or being being detained I mean this is like mind
[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:37.480]  control where you can have all the drones killing people all day that's
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:43.040]  beautiful but but but but you're gonna get grabbed for Hello Kitty bubble toys
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:51.240]  yeah well the media companies I think are panicking because the the frequency
[02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:57.360]  of these mass shootings is getting is increasing and people's pointing
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:02.460]  fingers in many directions including the big media companies so in the case they
[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:07.500]  they are conglomerates and they own film divisions they own TV divisions and they
[02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:14.400]  own print divisions and they have movies that are showing an enormous amount of
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:18.240]  mass slaughters and they've been making billions of dollars with these movies
[02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:22.080]  and they also own news content divisions and now they're I think they're
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:28.380]  completely stupefied because they don't want to upset their franchise selling
[02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:33.960]  gory films by upsetting people by showing the real news I mean if you go
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:37.200]  back the old history of the past 20 years there's a great film that came out
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:42.760]  a while ago called fish show that Robert Redford made that show the transition
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:47.000]  from news to game shows that happened in the 1950s and now we're going through a
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.780]  new transition where news has become and no news you're not allowed to see news
[02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:55.640]  anymore you're only allowed to see simulated events and simulated news
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.680]  because the real news would if you watch it and you're injured we can't it might
[02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:05.400]  create a liability that we're then liable for only the controlled violence
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:11.440]  that's completely insured are we able to show you so I see this as just another
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:16.640]  symptom of a society the American society fueled with cheap money cheap
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:21.080]  drugs and other than the rest of it it's just a break it's just a disintegrate
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:24.440]  we're gonna go to a witness turn her up go ahead CNN doesn't want you to see
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:26.840]  this here is for radio why don't you tell me what you saw no actually I
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:30.520]  wasn't in the library was a friend in the lab that's right and they came she
[02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:36.680]  came to our class 308 and to get somebody out of class and to tell them
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:40.920]  that it was a lot of shooting going on well of course that scared us so what
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:46.600]  what happened was that we all just cut off the lights we shut down all the
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:51.640]  computers and the teacher told us is the closet just in case but to be quiet and
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:55.920]  we was there for a while a long time and of course we started hearing the
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:01.800]  helicopters but we finally got the internet on channel 11 and that's when
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:06.920]  we found out what had actually happened I didn't hear the shooting but somebody
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:10.240]  else did so because someone came into your classroom you hunkered down right
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:13.600]  there in the classroom unbelievable that was the only way I will keep going back
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:17.120]  to Max Kaiser while we run this video but let me just point out I've made the
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:21.600]  point that why don't we just train people to line up back to back so one
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:25.280]  bullet could kill three people because I mean that's the only step more
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:31.040]  ridiculous than these these these colleges and public schools training
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:34.680]  people to get in fetal positions and wait to be killed I mean if there's a
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:39.040]  mass shooting people inside need to evacuate every time they knock the knock
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:43.960]  the prison windows out toward is a prison to get out and and look overall
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:48.520]  crime violent crimes going down FBI numbers but mass shootings are going up
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:51.920]  because the media is advertising this and I want to point out what max is
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:56.480]  talking about about fakeness presidents band pretended to punch up drugs here
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:02.440]  for me turns out that was all fake Obama faked meeting with people faked videos
[02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:09.480]  separate from the inauguration you know all recorded it's just again they the
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:13.760]  establishment is going to everything being fake because real stuff might
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:18.960]  get out of hand this shows the system is desperate you know I gotta say this max
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:24.480]  is bad as things are right now the good news is I see panic and fear in the
[02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:28.840]  establishment size they're power-grabbing right now and they're so
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:32.040]  insulated I don't think this is going to go well for them I mean let me tell you
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:35.160]  I'm not bragging about this I don't tell this story like I'm a big shot it's
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:39.240]  actually pretty creepy and freaks me out and gives me anxiety I went to Big Bend
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:43.200]  National Park on the Texas-Mexico border this weekend and there were people from
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:48.800]  France there there were people from New York there California at some cases 80
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:53.320]  percent of people if I stopped or something just you know to sit there and
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:58.160]  take photos if I was in a congregated area would say Alex Jones Alex Jones and
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:00.880]  it wasn't from really Piers Morgan I'd say how do you know about me I've been
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:06.320]  listening for years listen when when when upwards of half or more of people
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:11.760]  know who I am and say they agree no matter where I go now max I can go to
[02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:16.840]  the hike and bike trail and in some cases everyone that comes by as a
[02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:21.600]  listener I'm not bragging and saying I'm a big shot it's scary max because they
[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:25.040]  I mean that yeah I don't want to die they might come after me I don't know
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:29.440]  how our numbers don't show we're this big yeah 15 million a week that the 15
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:33.000]  million a week is not enough to have people from France knowing who you are
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.200]  yeah and then the next table knows who you are and then the waitress knows who
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:41.000]  you are and it's and then one and then somebody else comes over I mean what's
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:45.480]  going on with that max well I've told you when I travel I've traveled in the
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:50.600]  Mideast and around Europe and Asia and I people know me from the TV show and
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:56.520]  almost invariably that people say and I watch Alex Jones and it's just the power
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:01.680]  of the internet people watch your videos and the message resonates all over the
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:05.480]  world and you're getting recognized all over and out I mean this is I mean the
[02:41:05.480 --> 02:41:10.440]  establishment better be concerned well I think your message resonates outside of
[02:41:10.440 --> 02:41:14.320]  America more than it does inside of America because people outside of
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:19.160]  America have already been dealing with outright tyranny for decades for
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:23.560]  generations and they know exactly what you're talking about it's only inside
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:28.640]  America that your message falls on deaf ears in some cases because America has
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:34.520]  been very quiet for decades now post World War two it's been a Shangri-La
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:39.800]  it's been a happy town because we've benefited from winning that war and
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:45.800]  we've had a 60-year run but that's coming to an end because a lot of the
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:50.360]  trends that shape the good times are finishing and we're entering a new
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:54.360]  period so it's it's funny that in your own country you're not as well
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:58.040]  appreciated I think as you are it outside of your own country I can
[02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:01.840]  anecdotally tell you that from traveling to these countries and hearing people
[02:42:01.840 --> 02:42:07.880]  talk about you extremely with great fondness more so than I hear people from
[02:42:07.880 --> 02:42:11.880]  the US well just to be clear I didn't even bring this up to say hey I'm really
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:18.520]  big folks it's actually creepy because what I'm saying is is that the word is
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:21.680]  getting out let me show people some of these headlines wrangle some of the
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:30.040]  southern areas have cultures we have to overcome and CNS news even has video of
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:33.840]  him saying this on the news I mean like like if you live in the south you're
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:37.680]  just bad if you're a gun over you know you're a Nazi period lawmakers
[02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:41.240]  introduced bills to ban high-capacity gun clips Texas sheriff's I will not
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:44.960]  enforce law I consider unconstitutional same thing with Missouri sheriff's my
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:51.120]  point is is look at this Sarkozy to move to London to avoid France's high taxes I
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:43:00.000]  mean how far can these bureaucrats go till everything collapses this week in
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:06.320]  Switzerland of course it's Davos and Davos is really the the primo of all the
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:12.520]  new world order get-togethers I think it might even be more influential than the
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:16.800]  Bilderberg meetings because here you have in the highest mountains Switzerland
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:20.800]  really the cream of the cream coming together and cutting deals and doing
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:26.280]  deals and so it's happening this week and this is where now we'll find out a
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:30.840]  couple of weeks what they decided to do in Davos and we'll find out what
[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:35.640]  companies got bought and who's who's gonna go after home and a lot of news
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:39.840]  will come out out of it but I think Davos is really in in Europe is is the
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:45.000]  number one event of the year for these guys these tyrants like Tim Geithner who
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:51.040]  just came out the news that in 2008 2007 he was selling information to Wall
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:54.960]  Street about which way the Fed and the Treasury were going to move interest
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:59.720]  rates he was alerting the back you know private conversations essentially
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:03.720]  selling information because that he go to Davos and he'll get paid a lot of
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:08.080]  money from the folks that's where they the bag man you speeches as a way to get
[02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:12.000]  paid off I remember you on the show with bags of money the Geithner and they're
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.840]  right there with their bank accounts you know he's already got caught cooking the
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:18.400]  books for his own tax returns a few years ago so they take go to Davos
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:21.840]  that's where they hand him the bag full of money you can stick it in one of the
[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:25.160]  private banks there and it's there now for the rest of his life that most is
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:30.520]  where Tim Geithner gets the you know that 20 or 30 million dollars just
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:34.440]  hand it to him in in precious metals or diamonds or cash and he stores it away
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:37.880]  that's what they do in Davos that's what is there for that's what a new world
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:42.480]  order gets paid today is payday for the new world order in Davos Switzerland
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:46.440]  they worked all year they get their bonuses they get them today in Davos
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:51.120]  this week in Davos Buffett gets his big satchel of cash Geithner gets his
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:55.360]  satchel of cash everyone gets paid this week in Davos so let the party you know
[02:44:55.360 --> 02:45:00.360]  let the parties flow I want to shift gears again ladies and gentlemen we're
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:03.440]  obviously going to go into overdrive we're showing pictures here a live feed
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:06.840]  from a helicopter that CNN says you're not allowed to see so we've entered a
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:13.640]  new Orwellian level here where CNN and other cable news channels are saying
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:18.960]  they're not going to show live feeds we have the KHOU feeds you can see it they
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:23.600]  must have huge servers as this is being watched all over the country we have the
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:29.360]  KHOU feed posted at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now but CIA
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:35.520]  operative takes responsibility for Algerian gas plant attack in the video
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:41.600]  Mo Qatar Bell Mo Qatar said to be the mastermind behind the terrorist attack
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:48.800]  by the Islamic al Mujahideen brigade in the gas complex in Algeria takes credit
[02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:52.760]  for the operation now let me show in the document cam viewers this a radio
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:45:55.880]  listener should go to infowars.com this is confirming what the London
[02:45:55.880 --> 02:46:00.240]  Independent was saying terror in northern Africa are Westerners pulling
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:06.280]  the strings and it has the it has the Prime Minister Sayal telling reporters
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:11.440]  that it's an English accent groups leading the Al Qaeda forces well we know
[02:46:11.440 --> 02:46:14.800]  Al Qaeda works for the West they've given them Libya in Syria they've now
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:20.320]  taken over Libya they're deploying into other areas and then using this as an
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:27.080]  excuse for NATO through Afrikan to invade and and run raids into these
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:33.120]  areas just absolutely amazing and US begins transporting French troops and
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:37.880]  equipment into Mali with another staged event as a pretext I mean how unveiled
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:42.600]  does this have to get where the West publicly runs Al Qaeda I mean does that
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:46.320]  not add massive credibility to everybody that pointed out that government was
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:53.680]  involved in 9-11 well Tony Blair you know he gave him credit for setting up
[02:46:53.680 --> 02:47:00.600]  the collapse of Libya his relationship with Gaddafi he had him profited
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:06.480]  handsomely from that he's a Davos guy Davos man Tony Blair he's cutting deals
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:11.800]  all over the world and of course Mali is the the the collateral damage of Libya
[02:47:11.800 --> 02:47:15.040]  because all those weapons suddenly found their way onto the street and into
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:18.800]  Algeria and into Mali and so that there's a whole what they call the
[02:47:18.800 --> 02:47:26.560]  Maghreb the North African region is now become you know controlled by those
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:33.520]  folks that are at war with the banksters the Western interests that have been you
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:38.520]  know screwing with them for a number of decades and the response from the US and
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:43.160]  Britain seems to be completely wrong-headed they they don't understand
[02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:46.440]  what the why the problem started they don't understand why the problem
[02:47:46.440 --> 02:47:49.440]  continues and they have no idea how to end the problem so they're just going to
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:56.680]  continue to foster continuation and spread of enemies you know when they go
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:01.480]  they send drones into Pakistan or these places and just murder people
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:04.760]  indiscriminately they're breeding problems and of course they don't have
[02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:07.440]  the money to pay for all this so I have to borrow more money who are they
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:12.520]  borrowing it from China China's now war with Japan who's who's allied with the
[02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:16.240]  US so we're in World War three right now it's being fought in the currency pits
[02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:20.280]  it's a currency war and it brings us back to the fundamental reality that
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:23.520]  countries like Germany aren't repatriating their gold the Netherlands
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:27.000]  is repatriating their gold because they don't trust that's anymore they want out
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:31.000]  of Dodge they want their gold and they don't want to play this game anymore and
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:35.080]  that's why gold is going to go to ten thousand dollars an ounce because the
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:39.640]  gold is not in these walls to spend sold already to pay for these stupid
[02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:43.200]  ridiculous how are they going to cover it now that these countries are all
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:46.440]  demanding their gold out of the private Federal Reserve Geithner's over there
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:50.920]  you know hanging out at Davos the public Bilderberg meeting I mean it's just
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:54.160]  their craziness they're gonna cut them a check they're gonna cut them a check and
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:58.640]  say okay you we owe you thirty billion dollars in gold here's a check for thirty
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:01.840]  billion dollars and these countries will say wait a minute we want the gold and
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:06.040]  they'll say sorry we don't have it the here's the check it you know sorry it's
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:09.800]  tough luck and that's when they're going to that's when that's when all hell's
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:12.840]  gonna break loose because then you're gonna realize that the gold has been
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:17.680]  sold it's not there and you've got this reporter real fast talking to the police
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:22.240]  she's getting the statements kind of find out what the latest and greatest
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:31.800]  information may be as far as information we are going to bring that update to you
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:36.680]  but just to sort of recap what we believe we do know at this point is the
[02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:40.840]  before she was pulled away to get the latest information I did learn that the
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:45.280]  person that they do have in custody they are unsure if that person is actually a
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:49.520]  shooter or is actually a person who may have been involved in the altercation
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:53.600]  that led to all of this at this point if this isn't stage you watch it's gonna be
[02:49:53.600 --> 02:49:58.400]  gang related the ability of trying to get some of because 77% of the shootings
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:01.680]  that call mass shootings are gang related which is still bad but it's to
[02:50:01.680 --> 02:50:05.600]  adult shooting each other you know over the gangster culture that's so popular
[02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:11.960]  also pushed I tell you max Kaiser is our guest this is just amazing max Kaiser
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:15.480]  calm max we're gonna do a little bit of overdrive if you can do it because I've
[02:50:15.480 --> 02:50:19.080]  been cutting you short here and I got so many questions when we come back what
[02:50:19.080 --> 02:50:23.480]  will it look like as the countries say give us our money they say no that's
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:28.720]  already happening what will that do will that create even more uncertainty with
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:32.720]  the IO use and how long can the globalist pay off the Chinese the
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:36.640]  Germans and others with bags of cash that is being devalued and what happens
[02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:41.440]  once the dollar does lose its status I mean what type of bonker insanity these
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:46.040]  dollars have been buying everybody off so far by the globalist I guess the
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:48.280]  globalist will just move to another country and we'll get the blame for it I
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:51.360]  think that's the answer but we're gonna find out you know there's max Kaiser
[02:50:51.360 --> 02:50:54.960]  gonna be right in April or within a few months of that is it going to be the
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:59.120]  next level of collapse and what will that signify I'm Alex Jones and this is
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:04.360]  the end fall war if you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators but
[02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:08.280]  we're waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse then you're not gonna
[02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:12.240]  want to miss this exciting message here's why our solar generators provide
[02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:16.840]  life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run
[02:51:16.840 --> 02:51:21.280]  quietly emit no fumes and produce electricity from the Sun so when the
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:25.360]  lights go out you'll always have the power you need now here's the best part
[02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:30.080]  every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as
[02:51:30.080 --> 02:51:35.160]  new we put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:38.960]  at the end of each year we call them scratch and dead units but they're
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:42.920]  really just like new each unit comes with a full factory warranty and
[02:51:42.920 --> 02:51:47.840]  special bonuses you just won't believe don't wait they go fast go to scratch
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:52.280]  and then solar calm that scratch and then solar calm for the craziest offer
[02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:57.200]  we've ever made go to scratch and then solar calm that scratch and then solar
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:52:04.960]  calm hi there my name is Frank Bates what I'm about to tell you in the next

[02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:17.480]  you know a few months ago a listener if you're watching on TV sent us this Obama
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:25.120]  snow globe and when we shake it up was our Christmas present it's totally and
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:31.200]  completely filthy inside which I thought was fitting it's clouded and looks like
[02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:36.840]  there's bacteria or sewage in it let me let me shake this up for everybody and
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:43.060]  show the viewers a document cam shot there you go so thanks for the Christmas
[02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:46.520]  present it turned out even better than we thought it came in the official
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:51.160]  packaging and everything probably made in China and probably has like fetid
[02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:55.680]  urine in it or something I don't know but there you go going back to Max
[02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:59.920]  Kaiser of max Kaiser calm you can follow us on Twitter at real Alex Jones and
[02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:05.360]  where is the best Twitter for you max there's several big ones out there well
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:10.680]  just max Kaiser so it's Twitter forward slash max Kaiser okay you heard my
[02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:14.400]  long-winded question before the break what is that what is the next stage of
[02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:18.800]  collapse look like and what will happen well I'm just reading zero hedge they
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:22.760]  got a story up right now Mervyn King Bank of England is talking about
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:30.080]  rebalancing to avoid a currency war and that's that's a big that's it that's a
[02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:34.960]  big moment because he acknowledges that we're in a currency war the UK pound is
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:38.760]  gonna have to be revalued down sharply that means purchasing power in the UK
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:42.680]  is going to collapse as you know I moved to London from Paris to observe and to
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:46.800]  report on the collapse of the UK pound in the UK economy because it's one of
[02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:50.120]  the most vulnerable economies in the world because they have so little gold
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:56.080]  after Gordon Brown sold most of it back in 2001 so this is another shoe to drop
[02:55:56.080 --> 02:56:02.400]  this is another chapter in the collapse of these paper money empires and of
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:06.760]  course gold and silver are acting fantastically well so far this year and
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:11.160]  it's just playing out exactly as we said it would over the past couple years and
[02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:15.960]  2013 looks to be a continuation so looking into your crystal ball things
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:25.960]  are right on schedule pretty much I say that the economy that growth needed to
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:33.800]  pay the debt is a quantity that will never come to pass and I'll give you a
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:38.760]  good example of how to determine that the the amount of debt in the world or
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:43.720]  even in the u.s. with with its many many trillions of dollars of debt but to pay
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:50.080]  that debt off it would of course be a subset of the tax being collected on
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:55.400]  growth okay so how much tax and how much growth would be required to pay the debt
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:57:01.600]  well all growth in the modern economy is tied to oil and if you were to burn a
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:06.080]  trillion barrels of oil the approximately the same amount of barrels
[02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:10.560]  of oil that have been burned so far in the last 100 years if you were to burn
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:14.880]  another trillion barrels of oil you would not generate enough taxable income
[02:57:14.880 --> 02:57:20.080]  to pay off the current debt doesn't give you an idea of how much debt there is so
[02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:25.080]  in other words this debt is never going to be paid off jobs are never coming
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:31.200]  back wages will continue to crash and the bond market collapse is coming and
[02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:35.240]  gold and silver are gonna go a lot higher that there's just there's just no
[02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:41.040]  way around it max we're in a little bit of overdrive here when we come back but
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:45.000]  you know all I can say is this you look at how they've tried to destroy women
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:50.680]  destroy the family how MTV has pushed gangster and jackass cultures on people
[02:57:50.680 --> 02:57:55.320]  how it's been sold that men are supposed to be weak and stupid or thug like I
[02:57:55.320 --> 02:57:59.480]  mean why would the system try to degenerate society I guess for the
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:03.680]  casino gulag model that you talked about and it's all happening you said a moment
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:08.720]  ago you talked about what's the endgame for the the elites I mean look what Glenn
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:12.600]  Beck is doing he's trying to create it he's got two billion dollars he wants to
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:18.000]  create his own village his own society down there in Texas the Koch brothers are
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:22.760]  want to buy an island in Detroit and create their own you know their own
[02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:28.240]  society you've got two or three examples now of these elites wanting to build
[02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:34.840]  their own castles their own neo-feudal like it like they said that's the model
[02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:38.640]  and then they're gonna call it libertarian globalism collapses things
[02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:42.840]  then they exempt themselves from libertarian stay there we're gonna we're

[02:59:00.760 --> 02:59:05.800]  to shut down societies and starve Patriots out until they acquiesce to the

[02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:00.800]  Broadcasting Network
[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:13.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:20.680]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[03:00:20.680 --> 03:00:26.360]  Alex Jones you see the globalist have exempted themselves from all the laws
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:31.400]  regulations and rules that they've created and pushed so that only they can
[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:35.280]  operate and so they're gonna have city-states that are outside of the law
[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:40.040]  and given special licensure by the power structure so the elites can live in those
[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:44.480]  they're then gonna get the scared middle-class to pay exorbitant prices to
[03:00:44.480 --> 03:00:48.560]  live within the castle walls and we actually covered that in a bunch of
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:53.400]  recent reports we did last year breaking that down and again after they collapse
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:58.360]  and suck everything together then like this big Bilderberg group member has
[03:00:58.360 --> 03:01:02.000]  talked about the floating cities and all the rest of it then I'm gonna do a
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:06.160]  special report on this then they exempt themselves and you've got to go live in
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:10.640]  their system if you have any money I mean it they figured it all out that's
[03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:14.000]  why they're getting rid of nation states with a global crime syndicate above it
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:17.680]  who then will get their own private zones where they can operate however
[03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:21.560]  they want and yeah can you imagine it's like zeitgeist living in Glenn Beck's
[03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:26.680]  two billion dollar libertarian heaven in Texas and I knew they were looking at
[03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:29.720]  stuff outside Austin I talked about the time to Glenn Beck was moving to Texas
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:33.800]  before he did I said it could be Austin because they were looking at properties
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:37.960]  here and I just hope he doesn't move and set up a bit I mean whatever it's a free
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:42.920]  country I guess he can set up is is his utopia here I know I'm not gonna be
[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:45.840]  living in it but see if you're an insider you're gonna be able to get
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:50.440]  deals as a stakeholder under general 21 to have lesser taxes to generate its own
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:55.320]  power its own food so you live in kind of like the Glenn Beck gulag man I tell
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:59.960]  you they've really thought all this out Max Kaiser I think you're gonna see one
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:03.440]  of these whether it's the Koch brothers or Glenn Beck I think it's gonna be
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:08.840]  another situation like the Hale-Bopp Comet cult or the Jim Jones
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:15.760]  Yana cult they become very insular after 10 years people start going mad and then
[03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.240]  there's mass suicide I mean that's where Glenn Beck is going we're gonna read
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:24.000]  about him in 10 years as the guy who convinced you know a 2,000 people to
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:28.960]  drink the Kool-Aid and commit suicide chasing his idea of whatever he's
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:32.720]  mumbling on about because when you secede from society and you set yourself
[03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:40.720]  up as in some way living according to an ethos that is completely divorced from
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:46.280]  anything that we know and appreciate as a democratic system let's call it or an
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:53.840]  American system or an egalitarian system you become prone to ego maniacal
[03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:59.960]  dictator like psychopaths like Glenn Beck who rise up and realize that the
[03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:04.440]  only way that he can escape facing the reality of his own shortcomings is to
[03:03:04.440 --> 03:03:08.200]  convince everyone and himself to kill themselves and that's where he's headed
[03:03:08.200 --> 03:03:13.440]  well I'm a January said it it's headed to sell real estate plan you know what's
[03:03:13.440 --> 03:03:17.600]  incredible I was actually approached and I think oh my gosh I just remembered I
[03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:22.920]  was approached by a bit successful businessman in Dallas about a month ago
[03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:27.520]  actually for this plan I think Beck must have I know he was talking to Beck and
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:31.840]  Beck I even know where it is oh my gosh see I don't even know about this you're
[03:03:31.840 --> 03:03:34.840]  sort of talking about I've been out of town for three days four days I went and
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:39.040]  looked it up and sure enough he's announcing it he's not saying where I
[03:03:39.040 --> 03:03:44.760]  know where the idea came from oh my gosh I can't believe it it's a it's a it's a
[03:03:44.760 --> 03:03:50.400]  shopping mall that's gone bankrupt outside Dallas that's breaking news
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:55.480]  right there at least I know Beck is is looking at it oh my gosh can you imagine
[03:03:55.480 --> 03:04:00.320]  going and living in a shut down shopping mall that has shops that then they're
[03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:03.920]  gonna have stuff built around it where everybody moves which wouldn't be a bad
[03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:08.280]  idea if it was his own incorporated city and I guess that's the plan wow I know
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:11.840]  Glenn Beck's plan unless I'm wrong because I was called by a another
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:15.800]  businessman who I know in the DFW area and he was telling me he was getting
[03:04:15.800 --> 03:04:19.760]  together with other talk show host and then he'd recently met with Glenn Beck
[03:04:19.760 --> 03:04:26.600]  well I understand that he's raised two billion dollars for this project so it
[03:04:26.600 --> 03:04:31.520]  yeah it's a very well-funded real estate project they're going to live a
[03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:36.320]  libertarian dream and as you as we were saying there's libertarianism and
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:41.520]  there's fake libertarianism more segment can you do it yeah whatever man yeah
[03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:47.640]  because I want to talk about this Peter Thiel the Bilderberg guy Glenn Beck now
[03:04:47.640 --> 03:04:51.240]  says he is the leader of the libertarians while Ron Paul supporters
[03:04:51.240 --> 03:04:54.800]  he said need to have the army used on him so that doesn't sound too libertarian
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:58.680]  to me I will be right back my gosh I am flipping out because I actually know
[03:04:58.680 --> 03:05:00.960]  about Glenn Beck's operation I forgot about this

[03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:31.760]  well it's a terrible shooting but not as bad as it could have been and as I said
[03:08:31.760 --> 03:08:36.720]  if it's not staged or some mentally ill Prozac head copycat er I've been saying
[03:08:36.720 --> 03:08:40.520]  this for over an hour since it broke and then we had no information only because
[03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:43.400]  it's usually only one of three things it's not hard to make these predictions
[03:08:43.400 --> 03:08:48.720]  CNN who says they'll decide what we're allowed to see and and would not show
[03:08:48.720 --> 03:08:52.880]  live feeds of it as we have been doing for TV viewers playing clubs for radio
[03:08:52.880 --> 03:08:59.480]  listeners two students wounded in Houston College shooting officials not
[03:08:59.480 --> 03:09:03.520]  servants believe two students were wounded in crossfire as two people shot
[03:09:03.520 --> 03:09:08.000]  at each other at a Texas Community College Tuesday so gang related folks
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:12.280]  it's gonna nip me because the culture is be a cool gangster you know all these
[03:09:12.280 --> 03:09:16.280]  rappers and people that end up shooting each other just to prove their men it's
[03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:20.620]  so horrible and there you go one of the shooters was also injured and is in
[03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:25.840]  custody in the North Harris campus of Lone Star College spokesman Jed Young
[03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:31.280]  said the other shooter fled the campus he said the police believe the danger
[03:09:31.280 --> 03:09:35.880]  has been mitigated so hundreds of police SWAT teams you name it and meanwhile
[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:40.640]  listen it's gonna be gang related I mean like I said most what they call mass
[03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:46.240]  shootings are rival gangs shooting each other at least three shot at Houston
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:50.280]  Area Community College they use the New York numbers so what was it nine people
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:57.160]  shot the shooter shot his estranged boss and then was walking away and the police
[03:09:57.160 --> 03:10:01.880]  shot a whole bunch of people in New York got nine people and then also some
[03:10:01.880 --> 03:10:05.200]  repair guy was on the bridge doing repair and they just came up and shot
[03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:08.760]  him and then another veterans car broke down they just pulled up and shot him
[03:10:08.760 --> 03:10:14.080]  and they and they count those as the shooting numbers they'll call it a
[03:10:14.080 --> 03:10:17.440]  criminal event now I mean they count those nine people in mass shooting
[03:10:17.440 --> 03:10:24.200]  numbers just just incredible yeah at least three shot at Houston Area
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:27.800]  Community College but one of them is the shoe is one of the shooters reportedly
[03:10:27.800 --> 03:10:32.200]  one of the alleged shooters and two of them are people shot in the crossfire
[03:10:32.200 --> 03:10:39.600]  thank God it wasn't another goth devil worshipper because you got the gut it's
[03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:47.720]  always the same goth devil worshipper in psychiatric care seeing psychiatrists
[03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:52.240]  and psychologists on serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:58.040]  I mean it's amazing Harrison Kleibel were into devil worship God and I'm not
[03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:00.960]  bashing folks like to wear black and all that you know there's different groups
[03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:05.640]  of people like that it's just that that's the mo Wow guaranteed it's gonna
[03:11:05.640 --> 03:11:10.000]  come out now gang-related and that's terrible news but thank God it's not 30
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:14.600]  dead people because they would really go to town with that and I still believe
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:17.280]  with all the hype we're seeing that they're gonna stay some false flags
[03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:20.600]  that's why they're so confident max Kaiser thanks for holding into

[03:11:38.560 --> 03:11:43.480]  has two billion dollars and is gonna build a libertarian utopia I know he's
[03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:48.440]  been looking at land outside Austin as I talked to one of the people involved
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:51.320]  let's leave it at that and I was horrified by it then it was actually
[03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:57.080]  Dallas that he moved to and then I got a call by a nice businessman I know who's
[03:11:57.080 --> 03:12:02.280]  a patriot and he said that hey you know there's this shopping mall that's
[03:12:02.280 --> 03:12:06.880]  bankrupt and we can make it all guns Patriots stuff survival stuff and and
[03:12:06.880 --> 03:12:10.160]  then maybe have a community around that because the worst real estate is is
[03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:14.840]  North Dallas you know in Texas it's just plunging that's the worst area in Texas
[03:12:14.840 --> 03:12:18.360]  overall good state and it may not be the same deal by but I know this guy's met
[03:12:18.360 --> 03:12:21.240]  with Glenn Beck because he told me about that too and I've got a singing
[03:12:21.240 --> 03:12:24.080]  suspicion that's where he got the idea because Beck doesn't ever have his own
[03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:27.080]  ideas it's always somebody else's I'm gonna make a phone call after the show
[03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:29.680]  today but it's the idea of Peter teal the big
[03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:36.780]  Bilderberg guy teal feel or teal always get it wrong yep say it again
[03:12:36.780 --> 03:12:40.080]  yeah yeah that Mike's so bad I can't understand a word coming out of it hold
[03:12:40.080 --> 03:12:47.840]  on feel yeah yeah th yeah the of that Bilderberg guy is the one you know
[03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:52.000]  pushing this but again they bankrupt things then make themselves exempt from
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:56.160]  the very taxes and then go live in these command bases that's what the globalist
[03:12:56.160 --> 03:12:59.960]  have said is their model so I guess Glenn Beck's is trying to copy that now
[03:12:59.960 --> 03:13:05.120]  I've been ranting go ahead Max Keiser well first of all is a carpetbagger who
[03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:09.280]  wants his Yankee down in Austin Texas I mean don't you Texans have more
[03:13:09.280 --> 03:13:13.400]  self-respect to this I mean you got to run this guy out of town shouldn't
[03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:19.160]  there be I mean y'all got the guns y'all got the the manpower why are you letting
[03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:23.800]  this carpetbagger come down to Austin Texas and set up his libertarian utopian
[03:13:23.800 --> 03:13:29.360]  paradise which is gonna nothing but a scam media scam in your backyard that's
[03:13:29.360 --> 03:13:37.100]  an insult Alex I'm just speechless here it's just things are getting so
[03:13:37.100 --> 03:13:43.400]  just help it's an insult how dare he go move into the Holy Land of Austin Texas
[03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:47.440]  you know it's not gonna be weird anymore instead of saying keep it weird Austin
[03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:51.320]  Texas it's gonna be like welcome to Glenn Beckville where everybody is
[03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:57.760]  boring media Jack idiot you know he's really lowered the value of that town
[03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:02.300]  tremendously if you let this carpetbagger into town and can't you do
[03:14:02.300 --> 03:14:05.760]  something you got listeners down there isn't there something you can do Alex we
[03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:10.560]  need you to stop this from happening well I don't I don't know if he's
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:14.640]  moving to Austin I know he was looking at stuff here and pieces of land and
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:20.640]  stuff all I know is that I found out from people that worked in around him
[03:14:20.640 --> 03:14:23.820]  that indeed he did focus on everything we did have people watching it and when
[03:14:23.820 --> 03:14:28.600]  we see he takes what we do and then spins it and then he kind of just walks
[03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:32.980]  around in these weird you know blue jeans a little nerd outfit all creepy
[03:14:32.980 --> 03:14:36.840]  and and and and weird and a lot of his followers are good people but a big
[03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:41.200]  contingent of them are like into the wimpiness and into the whole and then
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:46.960]  he always sabotages libertarians at key points so I feel like he's on my six and
[03:14:46.960 --> 03:14:52.360]  it just is creepy knowing what I know about him that that he is constantly
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:59.320]  worried about what I'm up to and I just you know his whole career is based on a
[03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:04.880]  bad imitation of Alex Jones I mean before Glenn Beck came on Fox News I
[03:15:04.880 --> 03:15:09.560]  mean there was Alex Jones and you know you brought to the to the media and to
[03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:13.600]  the media world somebody who wore their heart on their sleeve in a very obvious
[03:15:13.600 --> 03:15:20.080]  way and then Glenn Beck did this on Fox News where he would well up and get very
[03:15:20.080 --> 03:15:24.520]  emotional over things and he's basically doing an Alex Jones impression so but he
[03:15:24.520 --> 03:15:27.880]  would not cover the stories that Alex Jones covers because of course he
[03:15:27.880 --> 03:15:31.760]  doesn't want to upset Fox News and his media masters and he's parlayed that
[03:15:31.760 --> 03:15:36.520]  into this new two billion dollar fandango down in Austin Texas so what I'm
[03:15:36.520 --> 03:15:40.760]  hearing he's going to build this utopian version of what I call fake libertarianism
[03:15:40.760 --> 03:15:44.440]  which means fake libertarianism means he'll say well I'm going to borrow two
[03:15:44.440 --> 03:15:48.080]  billion dollars at zero percent interest rate and if this works I'm going to keep
[03:15:48.080 --> 03:15:51.780]  all the profits and if it goes bust then everyone in Texas is going to have to
[03:15:51.780 --> 03:15:56.240]  absorb the losses and you say well why do you get to borrow two billion dollars
[03:15:56.240 --> 03:16:01.000]  at 0% they'll say oh I'm a libertarian that's not what libertarianism is.
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:06.720]  He supported the banker bailout. Well yeah that's not libertarianism that's not
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:12.840]  even capitalism that's outright fascism he's a fascist you know he accuses you
[03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:17.280]  being a fascist and yet he's the guy engaged in a two billion dollar fascist
[03:16:17.280 --> 03:16:22.160]  enterprise combining the banks with the land speculators in Austin that's
[03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:26.520]  fascism he's right there in your neighborhood. Well he's looking at Austin
[03:16:26.520 --> 03:16:32.400]  he's also looking at North the North Dallas suburbs area where it's probably.
[03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:37.800]  If you were so concerned he should check out Libya or Mali why doesn't Glenn Beck go
[03:16:37.800 --> 03:16:42.160]  there to build his libertarian paradise that's where it's needed you know if he
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:46.080]  really believes in the in the power of capitalism libertarianism why doesn't he
[03:16:46.080 --> 03:16:49.880]  go to to Mali and show the people there what Glenn Beck can do. But let's
[03:16:49.880 --> 03:16:53.760]  elaborate on this let's elaborate on this we've actually done news reports on this
[03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:57.080]  we cover it in Endgame people think of globalism as getting rid of countries
[03:16:57.080 --> 03:17:00.800]  they actually break countries into smaller pieces to control them they
[03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:04.640]  create regions like London or the Vatican that are outside of law and can
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:09.720]  do whatever they want Israel's a similar thing they build their own zones and
[03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:14.560]  that's what they're actually saying Peter Thiel and others is that they're
[03:17:14.560 --> 03:17:19.600]  going to establish this it's just amazing that we're actually like you
[03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:24.160]  said we're going back to feudalism. It is going back to feudalism and I have been
[03:17:24.160 --> 03:17:28.380]  saying that for a few years neo-feudalism and but this Peter Thiel
[03:17:28.380 --> 03:17:32.560]  character of course he made his money with PayPal and PayPal of course was
[03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:37.600]  that along with Visa and MasterCard shutting down WikiLeaks when when it
[03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:41.920]  became and they also are extra judiciously shutting people down that
[03:17:41.920 --> 03:17:47.080]  they don't want them to get their views like you know with the with copyright
[03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:51.240]  and other issues they just shut them down and that's where Peter Thiel
[03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:55.320]  comes from so he he made his bones engaging with the banksters directly
[03:17:55.320 --> 03:17:58.400]  through PayPal that's that's where he comes from so now he's going to take
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:01.560]  that experience and he's with the Bilderberg group now he's with these
[03:18:01.560 --> 03:18:04.560]  folks and they're meeting and they're doing their deals where they're going to
[03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:10.080]  try to create these little cul-de-sacs these little Disney asks fantasy worlds
[03:18:10.080 --> 03:18:15.520]  where they're going to be surrounded by an army you've got media ideologues like
[03:18:15.520 --> 03:18:19.840]  Glenn Beck at the center and within five or six years all the children are gonna
[03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:23.440]  look like Glenn Beck but they'll all be inbreeding so some will have three arms
[03:18:23.440 --> 03:18:27.400]  all right that's enough I don't want to get into a Beck bashing fest it's just
[03:18:27.400 --> 03:18:32.800]  that you know it's just incredible and he is out to get me and you notice I'm
[03:18:32.800 --> 03:18:35.560]  not out to get Rush Limbaugh I'm not out to get Michael Savage I'm not I don't
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:42.160]  talk about what's the other one's name I don't listen to it what's his name the
[03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:48.000]  guy on Fox News Sean Hannah Bill O'Reilly yeah what is they're not after
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:52.880]  me so I'm not talking about him it's Glenn Beck is always look how he moved
[03:18:52.880 --> 03:18:57.800]  up the road from me I mean it's like Sam I mean I need to get this guy out of my
[03:18:57.800 --> 03:19:03.520]  life he's super creepy well he's a stalker he's talking you so I mean you
[03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:08.280]  know you've got to deal with it in some way you just got to be enough people in
[03:19:08.280 --> 03:19:12.200]  Austin that support Alex Jones to do whatever it needs to be done to keep
[03:19:12.200 --> 03:19:16.480]  Glenn Beck out oh stop it he'll take that just a serious thing no no if he
[03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:19.400]  wants to buy property and do something to become a libertarian that's great in
[03:19:19.400 --> 03:19:23.040]  fact I want to think that he's becoming a better guy the problem is he's still
[03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:27.120]  you know really making stuff up about us I mean I'm not a fascist folks I'm a
[03:19:27.120 --> 03:19:31.400]  wild liberal in the Thomas Jefferson vein none of these names mean anything
[03:19:31.400 --> 03:19:34.880]  I'm called a right-winger today because I oppose Obama I am a true
[03:19:34.880 --> 03:19:38.920]  constitutionalist max I'd like to believe you're the same thing I mean a classical
[03:19:38.920 --> 03:19:45.200]  liberal right I'm actually a closet Texan well you lived in France he lived
[03:19:45.200 --> 03:19:47.920]  in New York he lived everywhere now you've moved to London to cover that
[03:19:47.920 --> 03:19:50.720]  maybe when it all collapses you and I will both move into Glenn Beck's
[03:19:50.720 --> 03:19:54.720]  neighborhood he won't be able to stop us we'll buy a cult compound right next
[03:19:54.720 --> 03:19:58.840]  door to him you can't say no he's a libertarian maybe remember the Alamo
[03:19:58.840 --> 03:20:04.680]  remember the Alamo remember the Alamo shows
