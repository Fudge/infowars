[00:00.000 --> 00:12.440]  The Democrats dragged the house in on a Saturday to debate and vote on the Delivering for America
[00:12.440 --> 00:13.440]  Act.
[00:13.440 --> 00:17.080]  I would think if we're being brought here on a Saturday in the middle of a pandemic,
[00:17.080 --> 00:20.960]  it's to help those millions of families who are struggling, Madam Speaker.
[00:20.960 --> 00:25.240]  I would think if we're going to come here on a Saturday, it would be to help those millions
[00:25.240 --> 00:29.120]  of small businesses, the restaurants in South Louisiana and New Orleans that don't even
[00:29.120 --> 00:33.680]  know if they're going to open again because of where we are right now.
[00:33.680 --> 00:37.440]  In this pandemic, you would think that's what we would be here for.
[00:37.440 --> 00:40.120]  But instead, Madam Speaker, why are we here?
[00:40.120 --> 00:46.520]  For a fabricated crisis, the Wall Street Journal, Nancy Pelosi goes politically postal.
[00:46.520 --> 00:50.160]  Congress ought to be embarrassed by this evidence-free conspiracy theory.
[00:50.160 --> 00:52.840]  It's the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times.
[00:52.840 --> 00:56.200]  I was a postal service regulator for 18 years.
[00:56.200 --> 01:01.040]  No panic, the service is perfectly capable of handling election mail.
[01:01.040 --> 01:05.520]  That was a Bill Clinton error, a pointy.
[01:05.520 --> 01:10.760]  Feigning an appreciation for the post office because of its timely political leverage.
[01:10.760 --> 01:17.400]  It is an all-American institution which enjoys the overwhelming support of the American people
[01:17.400 --> 01:25.480]  for a reason, again enshrined in the Constitution and an inseparable part of our national story.
[01:25.480 --> 01:29.480]  Bringing transition America from colonies to country.
[01:29.480 --> 01:32.480]  UPS and FedEx are doing just fine.
[01:32.480 --> 01:33.480]  Right?
[01:33.480 --> 01:34.480]  No, they are.
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.280]  I mean, it's the post office that's always having problems.
[01:40.280 --> 01:47.000]  The Delivering for America Act would support the post office with $25 billion more, regardless
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.680]  of the post office and others saying they don't need the money.
[01:50.680 --> 01:53.120]  In fact, they have more than they need.
[01:53.120 --> 01:57.600]  Even small businesses watching on a Saturday because they can't open, they're not even
[01:57.600 --> 02:01.160]  sure if they're going to be in business next week because they have no money in the bank
[02:01.160 --> 02:05.440]  and they're hearing about this crisis, Congress is coming in on a Saturday and then they find
[02:05.440 --> 02:10.480]  out the post office has over $12 billion in the bank, they've got access to a line of
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.560]  credit of $10 billion from Treasury that they can't get today because they've got too much
[02:15.560 --> 02:22.080]  money in the bank and it's so important, Madam Speaker, that 68 Democrats chose not
[02:22.080 --> 02:24.680]  even to show up today, 68.
[02:24.680 --> 02:29.680]  The leftist conspiracy machine churned out every possible angle they could muster.
[02:29.680 --> 02:38.120]  I'm here today because my constituents are not receiving their prescription drugs.
[02:38.120 --> 02:42.000]  Businesses are not receiving their mail.
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.160]  People are not receiving their mail.
[02:45.160 --> 02:51.160]  This administration is waging an authoritarian campaign to sabotage this election by manipulating
[02:51.160 --> 02:54.120]  the postal service to suppress our votes.
[02:54.120 --> 02:56.080]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[02:56.080 --> 02:57.580]  This is fascism.
[02:57.580 --> 03:04.200]  In Michigan right now, machines capable of sorting 35,000 pieces of mail per hour have
[03:04.200 --> 03:06.480]  disappeared from postal facilities.
[03:06.480 --> 03:12.480]  Their theater of delusions is actually a power play rewarding the unions and the Biden campaign
[03:12.480 --> 03:20.280]  with a mail in election process not seen since the Democrats of 1864 attempted to deny Abraham
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.320]  Lincoln reelection through the first run of mail-in ballots.
[03:24.320 --> 03:29.760]  These Democrats also referred to as copperheads had looked for an immediate compromise with
[03:29.760 --> 03:32.920]  the Confederates and the end of the abolition movement.
[03:32.920 --> 03:37.600]  The mail-in scandal met with disastrous results for the schemers.
[03:37.600 --> 03:42.960]  As Elizabeth Harrington pointed out, instead of having registered voters request ballots
[03:42.960 --> 03:48.440]  to prevent massive amounts of ballots being sent to dead people and those who have moved
[03:48.440 --> 03:56.040]  away, Pelosi's new bill sends ballots automatically to all voters, regardless if they are eligible
[03:56.040 --> 03:57.040]  or not.
[03:57.040 --> 04:01.640]  Dead cats and dogs will also receive ballots as they have in the past.
[04:01.640 --> 04:06.840]  The bill would prohibit any limits on delaying mail service while putting the future of America
[04:06.840 --> 04:13.080]  in the hands of a postal service whose political intentions are anybody's guess, whereas Town
[04:13.080 --> 04:18.440]  Hall reported just last month four men in New Jersey, including a sitting councilman and
[04:18.440 --> 04:24.220]  a councilman elect, were charged with multiple counts of voter fraud that involve tampering
[04:24.220 --> 04:28.120]  with the mail, stealing ballots and falsifying ballots.
[04:28.120 --> 04:34.160]  And a mailman in West Virginia was charged with voter fraud after altering several registration
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.400]  form requests to change the political party affiliation.
[04:38.400 --> 04:39.800]  What could go wrong?
[04:39.800 --> 04:47.520]  The vote in the House was 257-150, with 26 Republicans duped into voting on the Delivering
[04:47.520 --> 05:17.440]  for America Act with the Democrats, John Bowne reporting.
[05:17.440 --> 05:25.880]  And now, everything I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller
[05:25.880 --> 05:28.560]  Foundation documents, like lockstep.
[05:28.560 --> 05:31.560]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[05:31.560 --> 05:36.480]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago, and what I said last

[06:15.840 --> 06:24.240]  We are now 71 days out from the most important election in human history, a referendum of
[06:24.240 --> 06:28.240]  globalism and worldwide tyranny against Americanism worldwide.
[06:28.240 --> 06:32.120]  And the Trump, it's been Americanism, not globalism.
[06:32.120 --> 06:35.560]  It's been the credo and that's why the enemy is striking back with everything they've got.
[06:35.560 --> 06:41.160]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live, August 23rd, someday transmission.
[06:41.160 --> 06:42.560]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:42.560 --> 06:46.720]  We'll be here as we are every Sunday evening, thanks to your support and the good graces
[06:46.720 --> 06:51.480]  of our Heavenly Father from 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[06:51.480 --> 06:55.560]  Okay, let's launch right into it.
[06:55.560 --> 07:02.320]  There is a headline on Infowars.com today for the live feed of the show that has the
[07:02.320 --> 07:06.280]  live audio and video links in it.
[07:06.280 --> 07:15.520]  Breaking, Biden says he would kill 10 million people if recommended by scientists.
[07:15.520 --> 07:20.000]  That's the headline.
[07:20.000 --> 07:26.000]  Breaking, Biden says he would kill 10 million people if recommended by scientists.
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.040]  Now, I've been running headlines like that the last few months and they've been proven
[07:30.040 --> 07:31.040]  accurate.
[07:31.040 --> 07:32.040]  I'll show you in a moment.
[07:32.040 --> 07:37.200]  I'm just hoping the New York Times or Media Matters or somebody bites into it, attacks
[07:37.200 --> 07:38.200]  it.
[07:38.200 --> 07:39.200]  Of course, they don't.
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.200]  Where's USA Today's fact checker on this?
[07:42.200 --> 07:43.200]  They're nowhere.
[07:43.200 --> 07:47.160]  And it's not about Alex Jones being right.
[07:47.160 --> 07:51.440]  It's about simple math that I'm about to show everybody here on air because I've got all
[07:51.440 --> 07:53.400]  these hundreds of incredible stories.
[07:53.400 --> 07:57.840]  I've got 19 amazing clips.
[07:57.840 --> 08:01.880]  I've got all this important stuff breaking, but this is the big enchilada right now.
[08:01.880 --> 08:07.120]  So let me read you these headlines and then I'll go back into the big enchilada and then
[08:07.120 --> 08:11.920]  I hope you'll decide to call your friends, your family, your neighbors, everyone you
[08:11.920 --> 08:16.400]  know and tell them to tune in so we can turn this ship around.
[08:16.400 --> 08:17.800]  Let's just read these headlines.
[08:17.800 --> 08:22.520]  Virginia plans mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for all residents.
[08:22.520 --> 08:30.120]  UN Food Chief warns famine of biblical proportions looms for humanity due to COVID-19 that normally
[08:30.120 --> 08:35.360]  10 million starve to death a year that they predict 18 million will starve to death this
[08:35.360 --> 08:36.360]  year.
[08:36.360 --> 08:37.360]  Here's another one.
[08:37.360 --> 08:38.360]  Fox News.
[08:38.360 --> 08:41.120]  UN warns coronavirus fallout will lead to the next pandemic.
[08:41.120 --> 08:42.120]  Global starvation.
[08:42.120 --> 08:43.440]  Yeah, it's not coronavirus doing it.
[08:43.440 --> 08:45.000]  It's the panic and hysteria.
[08:45.000 --> 08:50.640]  8 million extra dead people when Corona hasn't even killed a million worldwide with fudge
[08:50.640 --> 08:56.720]  numbers because whether it's Germany or England or Australia, the U.S. or Canada or Mexico,
[08:56.720 --> 09:02.200]  they count, automobile accidents is Corona because the states get money and the locales
[09:02.200 --> 09:09.720]  get money for every Corona death, all set up by the UN, all fraud from the top.
[09:09.720 --> 09:11.320]  Let's continue.
[09:11.320 --> 09:16.200]  Here's the United Nations and I'm going to go over this more in a moment and the worldcounts.com
[09:16.200 --> 09:17.200]  using UN numbers.
[09:17.200 --> 09:18.200]  You say, well, you don't believe the UN.
[09:18.200 --> 09:21.320]  No, no, they're accurate on the numbers of starving to death a year, probably conservative,
[09:21.320 --> 09:28.640]  anything, just to make it that a child dies every 10 seconds up to 20 million Africans
[09:28.640 --> 09:30.960]  starve to death a year.
[09:30.960 --> 09:33.120]  Some years, some years are bigger, some are less.
[09:33.120 --> 09:34.440]  The average is only about 10 million.
[09:34.440 --> 09:35.440]  That's a good thing.
[09:35.440 --> 09:39.480]  And it just goes on from there that hundreds of millions are estimated to starve to death
[09:39.480 --> 09:40.720]  from malnutrition.
[09:40.720 --> 09:45.480]  They don't call it starvation itself where you die of no calories, look like a concentration
[09:45.480 --> 09:50.920]  camp victim, like little kids be eaten by buzzards while they're still alive in Central
[09:50.920 --> 09:58.080]  Africa and Northern Africa, but you die from a cold of the flu because you're so malnourished.
[09:58.080 --> 10:05.600]  And I've got the numbers here, latest numbers dying of malnutrition, 822 million in 2018.
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.560]  Yeah, starvation is the number one cause of death.
[10:10.560 --> 10:17.480]  COVID pandemic could last another two years, says World Health Organization, UN.
[10:17.480 --> 10:21.360]  And Bill Gates says the third world will never reopen, which is a total and complete
[10:21.360 --> 10:22.360]  death sentence.
[10:22.360 --> 10:25.760]  So let's talk about that headline.
[10:25.760 --> 10:41.760]  Joe Biden has come out and said that if scientists tell him to do another lockdown, that he will
[10:41.760 --> 10:42.760]  order a lockdown.
[10:42.760 --> 10:48.160]  Now, that's the scientists that told us 2.5 million Americans would be dead by August
[10:48.160 --> 10:53.400]  and it's 170,000, most of those are other deaths, other causes.
[10:53.400 --> 11:00.240]  He's the one that is telling us to do whatever scientists say that use the deaths of people
[11:00.240 --> 11:01.880]  that not have other things as COVID.
[11:01.880 --> 11:06.200]  He's the one that has first told us don't wear a mask, now wear a mask.
[11:06.200 --> 11:14.560]  We're supposed to have Fauci and the United Nations tell us no matter if it's a death
[11:14.560 --> 11:19.640]  sentence for the third world and a poverty sentence for us in the first world, I would
[11:19.640 --> 11:23.600]  shut country down again if recommended by scientists.
[11:23.600 --> 11:26.200]  So what does that translate to?
[11:26.200 --> 11:32.960]  He would kill an additional 8 million people, the UN Projects will starve to death this
[11:32.960 --> 11:41.120]  year and millions more after that to save a few 100,000 who are obese, have diabetes,
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.120]  are super old and don't take care of themselves, the average death age is 85.
[11:46.120 --> 11:52.440]  Oh, and they send COVID patients who are healthy to nursing homes to get some deaths.
[11:52.440 --> 11:56.760]  It's roughly 44% of nationwide deaths are in nursing homes.
[11:56.760 --> 12:01.040]  They lock your family out so you can't see your family, but they send patients to infect
[12:01.040 --> 12:10.040]  them and it's 10 states that did it, all Democrat and those same 10 states are criminals
[12:10.040 --> 12:16.360]  like Cuomo, if you remember, who said the MRA can't have an event here, you can't have
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.560]  a pro police event, will arrest Ted Nugent and members of Congress if they break our
[12:21.560 --> 12:26.160]  state quarantine and come here, you'll be locked up for 14 days, oh, but the MTV awards
[12:26.160 --> 12:29.920]  they can go forward with no screening, no nothing.
[12:29.920 --> 12:33.200]  Of course it's all a hoax.
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.600]  Governor Newsom keeps his wineries and restaurants open, he has the biggest in the state.
[12:38.600 --> 12:43.840]  Everybody else is closed or reduced, he never closed.
[12:43.840 --> 12:49.240]  These are master criminals and it's their new religion to put mask on us and take our
[12:49.240 --> 12:54.320]  temperatures and stick crap down our noses and they admit the tests are over 60% fraudulent
[12:54.320 --> 12:58.440]  depending on what type of test, it's all admitted.
[12:58.440 --> 13:05.680]  They've had thousands of clinics across the United States come up with 100% COVID positive
[13:05.680 --> 13:11.400]  test, you believe that, no, they get money when they get positive tests and hospitals
[13:11.400 --> 13:18.560]  get $12,000 for every person that has COVID and another 40 something thousand for every
[13:18.560 --> 13:24.640]  person they snake a tube down their throat intubate and it's all set up by the UN, Globalist
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.920]  Corporation set the policy, the UN puts it out, we follow it, we're told the UN is in
[13:28.920 --> 13:37.760]  charge, oh, the WHO, the gold platinum diamond crown standard, if they say it, you do it.
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.680]  And they lie about the origin, they lie about the spread, they lie about gain of function,
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.120]  they lie lie lie and now China is open for business, everybody else is, but not us, America
[13:46.120 --> 13:50.280]  is the worst, we're the worst, we have the most deaths, we have everything, we're the
[13:50.280 --> 13:55.240]  country that sucks because the same bureaucrats have actually worried the numbers to do the
[13:55.240 --> 13:59.960]  most tests here and to claim the most deaths here to demonize us because it's an attack
[13:59.960 --> 14:04.920]  on the US economy and our sovereignty and the election and the Democrats even admit
[14:04.920 --> 14:14.040]  that and now Cuomo at the DNC last week called it the European virus, upside down in reality
[14:14.040 --> 14:18.560]  and taking in God we trust off the money the Democrats said they want to do and taking
[14:18.560 --> 14:27.640]  out of the national pledge of allegiance and to God, one nation under God, they're assaulting
[14:27.640 --> 14:31.960]  everything because they want to be God.
[14:31.960 --> 14:35.640]  Now I have a solution when we come back and I have something positive when we come back,
[14:35.640 --> 14:38.520]  then I'm going to get into how to save these millions of people and the real numbers and
[14:38.520 --> 14:42.160]  what it means to the economy here and how bad it's going to get if we don't end this
[14:42.160 --> 14:44.960]  whole hoax and this year right now.
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.800]  But you know Governor Newsom and they also did it on the East Coast in New Jersey and
[14:49.800 --> 14:54.040]  New York, you know they closed the beaches off and on the last five months until people
[14:54.040 --> 14:57.720]  just rebelled and ignored it and local governments did.
[14:57.720 --> 15:05.560]  Well in Central Texas the rivers and the creeks and the springs are our beaches and they have
[15:05.560 --> 15:12.080]  tried to close rivers and creeks where people tube and relax that are on city and county
[15:12.080 --> 15:18.120]  property all over the state, people just refused, the police have refused to enforce
[15:18.120 --> 15:22.080]  and so they had to stop it in most of the state except Austin, it's totally globalist
[15:22.080 --> 15:24.880]  run and run by Big Tech and the Chai Combs.
[15:24.880 --> 15:29.360]  They have closed the main river area, they have closed the springs, they have totally
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.320]  closed Barton Springs, we went to the main park, climbed the fence and went in, over 300
[15:34.320 --> 15:38.920]  people showed up, this is the solution to the tyranny when we come back, this was the
[15:38.920 --> 15:43.680]  second week and it was amazing and Owen Schwerger gave an incredibly powerful speech.
[15:43.680 --> 15:48.000]  This is how you respond to the tyrants telling you you're locked down, oh but the Silicon
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.080]  Valley and the globalists, their parties, their MTV music awards, they go forward but

[21:10.840 --> 21:20.520]  yesterday in austin you may have tried to close martin springs but it's open because we are people
[21:20.520 --> 21:41.400]  are open again it's north korea this is texas
[21:41.400 --> 21:51.720]  that ladies and gentlemen is tyranny that's what it's like to live in communist china
[21:51.720 --> 21:59.640]  or soviet russia where they arbitrarily want to tell you that you can't go use that park
[22:00.600 --> 22:08.040]  all to show you that your slaves all to show you that your garbage all to make you submit
[22:08.040 --> 22:15.160]  it hey lifeguards are you guarding our liberty and freedom or are you proud of how they shut down
[22:15.160 --> 22:20.200]  martin springs just because we were coming here today are you proud of me and tyrants
[22:21.320 --> 22:26.520]  the left doesn't want any walls to the border but they want to pass walls to your park and tell
[22:26.520 --> 22:32.200]  you can't come at them and they're part of a nasty cump of sick evil control freaks this cump
[22:32.200 --> 22:38.600]  the takeover is a total end of america the whole thing's a fraud and it's disgusting and we will
[22:38.600 --> 22:50.040]  fight your evil commies all over austin when you try to steal our land you scum
[22:50.040 --> 22:58.040]  you
[23:12.760 --> 23:16.760]  it was actually amazing to be around a big group of people not wearing masks in the cult in the
[23:16.760 --> 23:20.760]  fear it was like i was back in the america back in the real world
[23:31.400 --> 23:34.760]  folks were having fun
[23:34.760 --> 23:44.760]  no one knew that walrus is to climb fences wait and watch
[24:04.920 --> 24:14.760]  yeah
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  giant freshwater park right out of the ground spring water healthy place to be
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.280]  common to say you can't go to it or the area that's free this is under the jurisdiction of the
[24:30.280 --> 24:38.840]  game order this is an illegal fit this is part of our waterways and yes i am that man
[24:38.840 --> 24:42.360]  that's right austin illegally dammed up that basically to river martin creek's huge
[24:42.360 --> 24:48.600]  legal waterway this is the legal fence it's all out of the way under justice law
[24:48.600 --> 25:00.040]  and hey guys we love you thank you for protecting our lives thank you sir
[25:00.040 --> 25:19.480]  finally they said one police officer they had like a hundred mobilized the police just stood down
[25:30.760 --> 25:36.600]  by the erection of a fence they're on and cannot prevent the public from going up and down cannot
[25:36.600 --> 25:43.720]  prevent the public from going up and down the river in both and fishing in its waters
[25:43.720 --> 25:47.480]  by the erection of fishes across the river
[25:52.440 --> 25:54.440]  that's the state law let me hold that let me hold that
[25:54.440 --> 26:03.320]  hey hundreds of people probably 300 yes sir you guys having fun right over there'd be about a
[26:03.320 --> 26:07.880]  thousand out there but you're you got better than what you forced it back open hey here's what i'm
[26:07.880 --> 26:14.600]  going to say that uh what's happening right here all around the country we have seen police
[26:14.600 --> 26:23.960]  officers take a knee to riot mobs that wanted to fund them and cover their deaths in the street now it
[26:23.960 --> 26:32.280]  may not be today it may not be today but one day our great men in blue that we support love so much
[26:32.280 --> 26:38.840]  one day our great police officers will realize you don't need to take a knee for us you need to stand
[26:38.840 --> 26:48.120]  with us and though that day may not be today someday our great men in blue will realize
[26:48.120 --> 26:56.120]  who are their allies and who literally wants them to be funded and dead and so we came over here
[26:56.120 --> 27:03.720]  and this is our peaceful protest to swim in waters that legally belong to us and so it may not be
[27:03.720 --> 27:09.000]  today where the police decide to stand for freedom and stand for the constitution and stand for the
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.000]  bill of rights and stand for the united states of america but someday in the near future if we
[27:15.000 --> 27:20.200]  continue to execute our rights peacefully and we continue to show them that we have their backs
[27:20.200 --> 27:26.040]  and we're in this together someday they will stand with us and someday they will take down the fence
[27:26.040 --> 27:35.720]  and watch us for being free and so i hope that the life starts here and the police one day will
[27:35.720 --> 27:57.400]  join us in one big USA USA USA USA USA all right the full report is up on band dog video there's
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.960]  a really fun little part at the very end that you don't want to miss it's a band dog video
[28:01.960 --> 28:07.080]  citizens invade closed Austin park shut down by communist city council and and remember
[28:07.080 --> 28:11.800]  while we're having our park shut down and small businesses shut down it's making people go bankrupt
[28:11.800 --> 28:17.720]  and have depressions and commit suicide which are up massively the third world is literally
[28:17.720 --> 28:24.200]  starving to death and i'm going to break this down in detail when we come back and then shift
[28:24.200 --> 28:29.000]  gears into all the other news the massive election fraud being pushed by the democrats and so much more
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.680]  it could not be a more critical time in the fight for human liberty and the power you have to change
[28:32.680 --> 28:37.560]  the world they're censoring members of congress the president everybody now because they know
[28:37.560 --> 28:42.200]  people are waking up and they know they're going to lose again this transmission is designed with
[28:42.200 --> 28:46.120]  truth to break their blockade we have the satellites we have the radio affiliates the tv
[28:46.120 --> 28:50.920]  affiliates we have our own servers we have band dog video we have a giant operation you help fund
[28:50.920 --> 29:00.120]  and build so use the weapon system now use info wars spread the links everyone tune in now take action
[29:00.280 --> 29:07.880]  you can really break civilizations down to two types predatory and non-predatory or oppressive
[29:07.880 --> 29:12.920]  conquest based or renaissance based and of course different types of civilizations and
[29:13.640 --> 29:18.280]  countries and political systems of history and at the present are mixes of the two
[29:18.280 --> 29:28.120]  but with globalism it is a post human ideology so it's scientifically geared to be oppressive
[29:28.840 --> 29:34.200]  and the rationale is social Darwinism that the ruling class are elites and because they're in
[29:34.200 --> 29:40.520]  power they have a right to rule over you poison you dumb you down sterilize you and kill you
[29:41.080 --> 29:46.440]  so all the people wearing masks like outside at the park and stuff are living in a total hoax
[29:46.440 --> 29:52.520]  and think their act of submission is an act of working for the common good in a collective no
[29:52.520 --> 29:56.840]  it's a sign that you're a slave who will take the force inoculations federal government
[29:56.840 --> 30:04.280]  Yale are studying the force inoculations right now it was a sleeper product it wasn't popular at

[33:22.520 --> 33:27.320]  plasma treatment there are many of these treatments that are very well known to have amazing effects
[33:27.320 --> 33:32.040]  not just on covet 19 but other uh pneumonias that are out there and so the media is trying to play
[33:32.040 --> 33:35.880]  this down because they don't want hope they want to kill the stock market and keep the lockdown in
[33:35.880 --> 33:45.800]  forever even though covet 19 is about one quarter as deadly as the seasonal flu with a 0.0032 number
[33:45.800 --> 33:49.960]  and that's even with all the people that died of other things fraudulently put in the column the
[33:49.960 --> 33:55.160]  next segment i'll hit the crime of the millennia the mass starvation of the world what covet 19
[33:55.160 --> 34:01.160]  is really designed to do here's the president speaking live he's coming to the podium all
[34:01.160 --> 34:06.120]  right once again a big announcement from the president regarding convalescent plasma let's
[34:06.120 --> 34:14.120]  listen you had a great weekend at your convention and we're gonna have a great convention coming up
[34:14.120 --> 34:19.800]  and i look forward to it but before i discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against
[34:19.800 --> 34:28.200]  the genovirus i'd like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in california and the storms
[34:28.200 --> 34:34.520]  in the gulf of mexico yesterday i approved a major disaster declaration for california spoke to
[34:35.160 --> 34:40.840]  governism as they battled two of the worst wildfires in the history of their state
[34:42.040 --> 34:48.360]  that continues the federal government has already deployed over 26 000 first responders
[34:48.360 --> 34:54.120]  and personnel to battle the wildfire we're gonna cut away from this live feed until he gets into
[34:54.120 --> 34:59.240]  the new coven announcement that he said is a big announcement with this treatment you know they
[34:59.240 --> 35:05.480]  also have the antibodies from llamas that was five months ago conclusive you inject somebody with
[35:05.480 --> 35:10.440]  those and they have pneumonia it'll cure i'm not just covet but you've also had with these medical
[35:10.440 --> 35:18.600]  doctors that treat hundreds of patients a piece who say you just give them a steroid inhaler and it's
[35:18.600 --> 35:26.120]  an autoimmune response uh that's what's causing the problem but there's all these treatments
[35:26.120 --> 35:31.160]  they don't want you to know that the un says it's a tube down your throat well you're not
[35:31.160 --> 35:36.200]  having the virus eat the tissue you're having an autoimmune response the lungs aren't
[35:36.200 --> 35:40.840]  failing because they're full of liquid they're failing because they've swollen up like when a
[35:40.840 --> 35:46.920]  bee stings you and the same thing happens what do you do an epipen or a steroid inhaler or if
[35:46.920 --> 35:51.880]  it's not that bad you take benadryl i personally been stung by bees many times did not become allergic
[35:51.880 --> 35:57.640]  till a whole swarm stung me 10 15 times you know like like a cartoon a big big swarm around me
[35:57.640 --> 36:02.520]  chased me into the house stinging me all over and i swole up and took a bunch of benadryl and
[36:02.520 --> 36:05.560]  almost had to call an ambulance but then i could i started to be able to breathe i was okay i didn't
[36:05.560 --> 36:10.680]  call an ambulance but begging started all over my head is right at the poison out but you know
[36:10.680 --> 36:16.520]  that's what goes on that's what happens uh so we now have the president is going to this new
[36:16.520 --> 36:21.480]  development that the media is trying to suppress right now here it is i'm pleased to make a truly
[36:21.480 --> 36:27.400]  historic announcement in our battle against the china virus that will save countless lives
[36:27.400 --> 36:38.840]  the fda has issued an emergency use authorization and that's such a powerful term emergency use
[36:39.400 --> 36:49.640]  authorization for a treatment known as convalescent plasma this is a powerful therapy that transfuses
[36:49.640 --> 36:55.800]  very very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling
[36:55.800 --> 37:01.880]  a current infection it's had an incredible rate of success today's action will dramatically expand
[37:02.520 --> 37:11.640]  access to this treatment and i want to thank dr han and secretary azar i want to thank the fda all
[37:11.640 --> 37:17.720]  of the people that have been working very hard on this it showed tremendous potential this is the
[37:17.720 --> 37:25.640]  only possible and and it's only made possible because of operation warp speed that is everybody
[37:25.640 --> 37:33.320]  working together we're years ahead of approvals we would be if we went by the speed levels of past
[37:33.320 --> 37:37.560]  administration we'd be two years three years behind where we are today and that includes
[37:37.560 --> 37:44.520]  and vaccines that you'll be hearing about very soon very shortly to deliver treatments and vaccine
[37:44.520 --> 37:51.400]  to save lives we're removing unnecessary barriers and delays not by cutting corners but by marshalling
[37:51.400 --> 37:57.080]  the full power of the federal government we provided 48 million dollars to fund the mayo clinic
[37:57.080 --> 38:05.080]  study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus through this
[38:05.080 --> 38:11.560]  study over 100 000 americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment and it has proven to
[38:11.560 --> 38:20.120]  reduce mortality by 35 percent it's a tremendous number the fda mit harvard immense sine hospital
[38:20.120 --> 38:28.600]  have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease
[38:28.600 --> 38:34.440]  based on the science and the data the fda has made the independent determination that the
[38:34.440 --> 38:43.800]  treatment is safe and very effective recently we provided up to 270 million dollars to the american
[38:43.800 --> 38:50.920]  red cross and america's blood centers to support the collection of up to 360 000 units of plasma
[38:51.640 --> 38:58.920]  in late july we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients to have who have recovered and
[38:59.560 --> 39:05.880]  these are patients that have been incredible the way they've uh donated but these are people
[39:05.880 --> 39:12.440]  recovered from the virus to donate plasma since then weekly plasma donations have doubled and today
[39:12.440 --> 39:19.000]  i once again urge all americans who have recovered from the virus to go to i will continue to monitor
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.200]  this and if we get some of the scientists up there we'll talk about this is all well known
[39:23.000 --> 39:31.160]  and they also have plasma from donkeys plasma from llamas uh that just automatically have resistance
[39:31.160 --> 39:36.360]  and immunity to things like this uh sharks they're studying and then have found uh don't ever get
[39:36.360 --> 39:41.720]  cancer you can have a 200 year old greenland great white shark it's a sub variety of those and they
[39:41.720 --> 39:47.080]  just don't get cancer they now think some sharks might live 500 years i mean why don't they get
[39:47.080 --> 39:52.520]  cancer why do we uh well because we're mammals and we have hormones and then when we're jacked up
[39:52.520 --> 39:58.440]  we're warm-blooded so we're that's why dogs only live you know 15 years their their hearts beat
[39:58.440 --> 40:03.720]  twice as fast they're just they're on a faster clock but we're on a powerful clock we are pretty
[40:03.720 --> 40:08.040]  amazing creatures ladies and gentlemen i'm not going to get into all the science you can research
[40:08.040 --> 40:15.320]  yourself it's just that this virus kills with all the added numbers of people that died in gunshot
[40:15.320 --> 40:21.480]  wounds and cancer and the flu and and i saw skydiving accidents i mean you name it they're
[40:21.480 --> 40:27.720]  all motorcycle accidents they're all put in there and that's done to create the fear it's still
[40:27.720 --> 40:36.520]  the national average is similar to europe's average the average is very but it's all 0.0
[40:38.280 --> 40:47.640]  0 3 2 3 4 3 7 i mean that that that i mean the flu might kill one tenth of one percent
[40:48.760 --> 40:55.000]  that get it every year and they're almost always old out of shape whatever and that's
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.240]  how this works but the idea that we're all locked inside we all wear masks we all do this
[40:59.240 --> 41:03.400]  for something they said was killing four percent of people let me tell you something
[41:04.120 --> 41:06.360]  if there was something out there killing four percent of people
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.680]  i would want anybody that had it to be quarantined that's what you do you don't
[41:12.680 --> 41:17.880]  quarantine everybody it's impossible it doesn't work and the studies show it
[41:20.200 --> 41:23.640]  but all these medical doctors have come out all these epidemiologists all these virologists all
[41:23.640 --> 41:28.360]  these scientists they said what i've said we've played their clips here they're all banned off of
[41:28.360 --> 41:38.280]  the media youtube google facebook twitter apple they all delisted they all push it down they
[41:38.280 --> 41:44.280]  all take it off they all suppress it in an organized criminal takeover then they endorse
[41:44.280 --> 41:48.760]  china for all of its tyranny and say they're the model keep everyone locked down on a permanent
[41:48.760 --> 41:55.320]  basis and now i've talked to sources inside the austin independent school district also
[41:55.320 --> 42:00.680]  the flugervilles school district and others and it's in the news that virginia and california
[42:00.680 --> 42:07.080]  and others are preparing mandatory vaccines the experimental ones that skipped human
[42:07.800 --> 42:14.040]  skipped animal trials and went right to these accelerated human trials where 100 percent of
[42:14.040 --> 42:19.080]  the people that were in the strong vaccine trial were sick and hospitalized 80 percent with the
[42:19.080 --> 42:25.560]  weak vaccine that they say doesn't give you immunity so why is trump saying the deep state's
[42:25.560 --> 42:30.840]  trying to block the vaccine coming out and all that he means a way to end the fear to get the
[42:30.840 --> 42:35.240]  stock market boosted to win the election to be the hero because he knows the un wants to get rid of
[42:35.240 --> 42:40.680]  him and make bill gates the hero later with forced inoculations and endless lockdown so he's playing
[42:40.680 --> 42:46.040]  this macchiabelle game with him because i know he knows what the vaccines to sit there and accelerate
[42:46.040 --> 42:50.840]  the program to make sure it's not their vaccine and then it just shut down the whole hoax once we
[42:50.840 --> 42:55.800]  have something that supposedly cures this hoax he wants to kill one hoax with another hoax but he
[42:55.800 --> 43:08.520]  says it won't be mandatory vaccines you hear that that's the march of the united nations
[43:08.520 --> 43:15.960]  and the bill and the gates foundation coming with their battle plan psychological warfare
[43:15.960 --> 43:22.840]  operation with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society
[43:22.840 --> 43:28.120]  they're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu they're creating artificial phobias
[43:28.120 --> 43:32.600]  for normal death that takes place they're not even promising to have a cure to it all they're just
[43:32.600 --> 43:39.080]  inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary regime directed by the who
[43:39.880 --> 43:47.320]  with vaccines that actually change your dna and make you owned by microsoft it's a final frontier
[43:48.360 --> 43:56.200]  it's the year 2020 it's not coming it's here and submission is blood in the water
[43:56.200 --> 44:05.640]  it was a sleeper product it wasn't popular at first but as people tried it it's become one

[47:09.720 --> 47:33.480]  live raw and uncensored i'm your host alex jones so let's get right into it
[47:33.480 --> 47:41.720]  there are hundreds of issues and hundreds of different sub-agendas that roll into the larger
[47:41.720 --> 47:47.160]  globalist planetary agenda that they've laid out on record and then i've chronicled here in detail
[47:48.840 --> 47:55.000]  but at the base of it is the power to decide who lives and who dies and to be able to carry out the
[47:55.000 --> 48:01.800]  orderly in their words depopulation of the planet not just the third world because a lot of people
[48:01.800 --> 48:06.360]  in the first world go oh well get rid of the third world especially leftists that tell you
[48:06.360 --> 48:10.680]  there's too many people oh they want you all to have the covid shot because they love life but
[48:11.400 --> 48:16.440]  man there's too many people let's abort all those brown babies but you have to understand even if
[48:16.440 --> 48:22.280]  you're what you call a tribalist or racist you see the third world being turned into armies
[48:22.280 --> 48:27.800]  of anti-white operatives that's being done by the globalist to make us clash together and kill each
[48:27.800 --> 48:32.280]  other even if you say okay go ahead and kill the brown people let's just get down to brass tax here
[48:33.320 --> 48:37.720]  and think you're with bill gates think you're with ted turner think you're with oprah lempery
[48:39.240 --> 48:46.360]  think you're with bill gates you're not so let's lay out the facts this is the un being honest
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.800]  and i don't just go off the un's numbers when they're lying about saying it wasn't person to person
[48:51.800 --> 48:58.600]  in wuhan eight months ago i told you they were lying for seven months ago i've studied the real
[48:58.600 --> 49:04.040]  numbers from other independent organizations agencies international aid groups and if anything
[49:04.040 --> 49:09.880]  these numbers are lower than what the un is saying and the un then uses the horror they exacerbate
[49:10.520 --> 49:17.000]  and that they accentuate that they add fuel to to then raise billions of dollars and have every
[49:17.000 --> 49:23.640]  supermodel and hollywood star saying you know give money to unicef save children in africa when
[49:23.640 --> 49:28.600]  meanwhile you know what they're really doing the ones that live are being shipped off to slave mines
[49:28.600 --> 49:34.760]  or being sold into sex slavery so there's the headline at info wars dot com i hope you share it
[49:34.760 --> 49:39.720]  for the live feed today after the show today it'll be an archive of the show biden says he would kill
[49:40.280 --> 49:46.520]  10 million people if quote recommended by scientist sunday live now is that an exaggeration by us is
[49:46.520 --> 49:53.480]  that clickbait no it's not here's what joe biden just had to say about he'll do whatever
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.600]  select globalist scientists say not with all the doctors and epidemiologists and virologists
[50:00.600 --> 50:06.200]  unanimously coming out across the world saying hydroxychloroquine zinc deficiencies vitamin
[50:06.200 --> 50:14.600]  d vitamin c llama antibodies uh simple steroid inhalers don't innovate people that kills them
[50:14.600 --> 50:20.200]  don't send people that are sick to nursing homes that'll kill more than it kills 44 of the total
[50:20.200 --> 50:25.320]  number they know what they're doing they're suppressing all the truth all the real doctors
[50:26.440 --> 50:30.520]  and trying to suppress the president while they scare us and say it's a problem that can never
[50:30.520 --> 50:37.480]  be fixed until america collapses and the un takes over while the un advises the takeover of our
[50:37.480 --> 50:43.800]  police so here it is fox news un warns coronavirus fallout will lead to next pandemic you mean
[50:46.440 --> 50:53.560]  you mean un warns coronavirus hysteria and fraud and lockdown will lead to the next pandemic
[50:53.560 --> 51:00.280]  global starvation again here's what joe biden had to say about it
[51:00.280 --> 51:07.960]  this morning come january and we have coronavirus and the flu combining which many scientists have
[51:07.960 --> 51:14.360]  said is a real possibility would you be prepared to shut this country down again i would be prepared
[51:14.360 --> 51:20.680]  to do whatever it takes to save lives because we cannot get the country moving until we control
[51:20.680 --> 51:26.920]  the virus that is the fundamental flaw of this administration is thinking to begin with in order
[51:26.920 --> 51:33.400]  to keep the country running and moving and the economy growing and people employed you have to
[51:33.400 --> 51:38.680]  fix the virus you have to deal with the virus so if the scientists say shut it down i would shut
[51:38.680 --> 51:45.880]  it down i would listen to the scientist that means bill gates doctor bill gates
[51:47.800 --> 51:51.880]  is not a doctor but gets up there on tv and tells you everything about your life when it's
[51:51.880 --> 51:56.440]  going to reopen well it never is going to really reopen but you'll take five vaccines a year that
[51:56.440 --> 52:00.360]  go in and change your dna and they're going to hurt a lot of people and i'm going to be indemnified
[52:00.360 --> 52:02.200]  and i make a lot of money off of it but so what
[52:06.280 --> 52:11.320]  but if you're a tv viewer look at that video again without audio they're all 20 something feet
[52:11.320 --> 52:15.960]  away from each other kamala harris joe biden the idiot abc news reporter
[52:17.640 --> 52:22.840]  oh because humans are so dangerous you got to stay back from them this is all showing more
[52:22.840 --> 52:27.080]  mistrust more division more lies and they're the democrats they're the ones that sold us out of
[52:27.080 --> 52:33.320]  china they're the ones that killed our economy oh but now they they want to stop the virus
[52:33.320 --> 52:38.920]  and control it but it'll never be controlled because it falls positives with the regular cold
[52:38.920 --> 52:45.320]  virus or a bacterial infection of flu it's a perfect enemy you can't see you can't really detect
[52:45.320 --> 52:51.080]  you can't ever stop and they're telling everyone to make your children your two-year-olds wear them
[52:51.080 --> 52:57.080]  versus six-year-olds and two-year-olds to get on airplanes or go outside it's a cult stop conforming
[52:58.200 --> 53:03.240]  they tell you can't have pro police rallies you can't have an nra rally in new york last week but
[53:03.880 --> 53:09.560]  you can have the mtv awards and there's no quarantine for that come on into the state
[53:09.560 --> 53:15.320]  it's all about control so here's the key big article up on info wars dot com
[53:15.320 --> 53:22.920]  similar headlines in the new york times un food chief warrants famine of biblical proportions
[53:22.920 --> 53:29.240]  looms over humanity due to covid-19 you mean due to the lockdown due to the hoax
[53:31.240 --> 53:36.200]  due to the shutdown that sends ripple effects we're in the third world they pay roughly half
[53:36.200 --> 53:43.000]  their paycheck for food and so when we shut down they starve to death and it goes over the numbers
[53:43.000 --> 53:48.760]  the covid-19 hysteria pandemic may lead to a calamity of epic scale with millions facing
[53:48.760 --> 53:54.360]  starvation worldwide the head of the un's hunger fighting body even though they're the ones triggering
[53:54.360 --> 54:02.520]  at all said all the data we have including world food program forecast that the number of people
[54:02.520 --> 54:08.760]  experiencing malnutrition will grow by 80 percent by the end of the year points to real disaster
[54:08.760 --> 54:13.080]  said david beasley executive director of the un world food program we actually went to the un world
[54:13.080 --> 54:18.920]  food program numbers here and there's an estimated last numbers they got 822 million people
[54:23.240 --> 54:29.400]  who in just the last few decades have starved to death and if you look at the numbers in here
[54:30.360 --> 54:34.040]  they estimate that around nine million to ten million people starve to death a year
[54:34.040 --> 54:39.800]  but sometimes it's way way higher and again they're saying this will be 80 percent higher this year
[54:39.800 --> 54:44.840]  so we're looking at about 18 million people starving to death and they don't they go on to say
[54:46.600 --> 54:52.600]  that in africa 20 percent of the population don't get enough to eat and so they end up being
[54:52.600 --> 54:58.440]  malnutritionist and and stunted shorter they don't live as long and they have lower IQs
[54:58.440 --> 55:04.440]  and that's how the old european elites would control people was not feeding the peasants
[55:04.440 --> 55:08.360]  as much they'd be called the little people you'd have the nobles that were you know
[55:08.360 --> 55:12.360]  two feet higher had bigger heads bigger brains when you have malnutrition
[55:14.120 --> 55:21.320]  you have lower IQ and you're more barbarous if you feed the africans a high diet notice they
[55:21.320 --> 55:26.600]  don't want people having meat oh third world doesn't get meat because high protein is associated
[55:26.600 --> 55:32.920]  with higher IQ and the globalists do not want that so they're not just going to kill an extra
[55:32.920 --> 55:38.120]  8 million people according to their own numbers they are going to then produce tens of millions
[55:38.120 --> 55:44.120]  who are zombie like i don't care if you're black or white you starve most of your young
[55:44.120 --> 55:48.680]  developed life or you don't get breastfed that's why they want formula here in the west plenty of
[55:48.680 --> 55:55.160]  food but not nutritious you have a smaller brain lower IQ than they had fluoride on top of that
[55:55.160 --> 56:00.360]  and then all the vaccines and you get that manageable population you want so this is the real aim of this
[56:01.400 --> 56:07.320]  bringing in the cashless society locking down the civilization testing the censorship of doctors
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.080]  and scientists that don't agree setting up internal checkpoints bringing in the global
[56:11.080 --> 56:15.560]  social credit score tracking everything you go where you go in lifetime major universities in
[56:15.560 --> 56:20.280]  europe and the u.s. announcing this semester you can't leave the whole semester of the college
[56:20.280 --> 56:25.080]  you'll be tracked by a cell phone you must carry that tracks where you go it's here folks it's not
[56:25.080 --> 56:34.600]  coming it's the plan and the un says at least two more years two more years of total lockdown and
[56:34.600 --> 56:39.160]  of course by then you'll be totally habituated and have your smartphones have your apps be tracked
[56:39.160 --> 56:45.720]  be controlled and they're announcing this fall this winter in virginia in california mandatory
[56:45.720 --> 56:52.040]  vaccines to go to school have a job in our government building but it's not really that they're
[56:52.040 --> 56:57.080]  mandating it but there's waivers under law because they can't make you do this there's
[56:58.440 --> 57:03.080]  vaccine liability protections how do you make me take something that you admit has liability
[57:03.080 --> 57:09.000]  protection well you can't there's loopholes so they act like it's the law when it's not
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.440]  but in australia it's becoming the law and in england it's becoming the law they're saying
[57:12.440 --> 57:17.800]  we're getting rid of vaccine exemptions you will take whatever we want bill gates says five new
[57:17.800 --> 57:23.880]  covid shots a year and 80 percent to take it gets sick i'm not kidding i can play a cbs even
[57:23.880 --> 57:27.640]  admitting it now they're telling you it's going to make you sick they're still going to make you
[57:27.640 --> 57:32.200]  because they can't hide what it's going to do and the studies show these vaccines are sterilizing
[57:32.200 --> 57:36.840]  people they've got cancer viruses in them and that's the old-fashioned ones these new ones man
[57:36.840 --> 57:40.200]  they are going to destroy your immunity to everything they're going to open you up and turn
[57:40.200 --> 57:45.560]  you into pod people they own and control this is about creating the post-human era we'll be back
[57:45.560 --> 57:53.000]  with hour number two spread the word the social engineers bet on you not having a memory more
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.800]  than anything they also bet is they constantly talk about it in their own words that you will
[57:57.800 --> 58:03.640]  adapt to being a slave that you will learn incrementally to submit so think about and remember
[58:03.640 --> 58:09.480]  the phases of the fauci fraud remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie
[58:09.480 --> 58:14.680]  they lied about where it came from they lied about person to person the un covered it all up
[58:14.680 --> 58:23.160]  then exaggerated the death rate at 4% but it's actually 0.032 now and dropping then they set
[58:23.160 --> 58:27.720]  the test up to count almost all false positives they put the names of people that died of other
[58:27.720 --> 58:33.080]  diseases in the covid column they only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown now we're six months later
[58:33.080 --> 58:37.640]  now they say it's permanent you got to wear masks forever and force inoculations are coming and
[58:37.640 --> 58:41.080]  they're going to track everywhere you go with what you do the global social credit score
[58:41.080 --> 58:45.720]  and the un is the boss anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job
[58:45.720 --> 58:49.000]  that's called 21st century tyranny that's called world government takeover
[58:50.760 --> 58:58.760]  how do you contest an election in the year 2020 well you trigger race riots and you tell the blue
[58:58.760 --> 59:02.840]  states and blue cities when you're the speaker of the house that you are legitimately now the
[59:02.840 --> 59:09.240]  president that's what she said on cbs news and then you're going to have those blue states succeed
[59:09.240 --> 59:14.280]  yes that's officially called a civil war ladies and gentlemen and the democrats are backed by the
[59:14.280 --> 59:19.880]  e you hollywood the chai comms and the whole globalist system this is treason with a capital T
[59:19.880 --> 59:24.680]  and our federal government is so paralyzed with cowards they won't even stand up against it
[59:24.680 --> 59:29.000]  and do anything even though our president has been exposing it but here's the bottom line

[1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:18.520]  that's leading another leftist politician caught staging an attack on themselves this time they
[1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:26.520]  filmed the whole thing how about bad acting wow we've also got uh just a bunch of epic video we're
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:33.240]  going to get to coming up next segment i don't know where to begin there's so much to hit
[1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:39.640]  i want to go out to break this is a little short segment with clip 10 pedo groomers from hell
[1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:47.960]  because the house leader republican leader has done it again kevin mccarthy who i gotta say i
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:54.440]  really don't like him he's like a very rhino-ish he's not as bad as uh people before him but man
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:01:00.600]  coming out and saying there's not a giant worldwide child trafficking ring and saying that the
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:07.400]  republicans must disavow this and then he blames it on q like oh see how the q thing works q
[1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:15.080]  could be good people bad people it's like anonymous but then they can have disinfo
[1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:19.160]  ops out there saying their secret agents saying they're part of this part of that you understand
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:25.480]  i mean i know the people that created it got taken away from him by the out of control system
[1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:30.360]  it's got a little bit better they hope it becomes a positive thing the white house does
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:35.000]  you're like i'm a real person talks the president talks to roger stone everybody like i'm a real
[1:01:35.640 --> 1:01:41.000]  quantity been around 26 years and then you'll just have people out of nowhere go i'm q commando
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:46.760]  and jones is fake he's with the bad guys and and we learn that people are funded by democrats
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:53.000]  but once people bought into a con because they want to feel special that it's very very hard to
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:57.640]  get amount of it so this whole child trafficking thing's very real you see a lot of the news the
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:02.280]  buster record level and there's a lot of positive stuff going on with the whole q thing but now you
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:08.120]  see they can have outlandish stuff like there's nukes going off underground battling the cyclopses
[1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:15.080]  and the kidnapped children are being freed for that cartoonish thing then covers up from the real
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:23.160]  stuff so let's go ahead and go to this very very important report that deals with all this here it
[1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:31.720]  is this is going to be the grooming of the next generation that's the whole goal is to make kids
[1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:36.120]  that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it and the woman gets up on
[1:02:36.120 --> 1:02:42.920]  a table spreads her legs it's a man this is adult entertainment but what do predators do they target
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:47.400]  children start them young right breaking news we have just confirmed that a registered child sex
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:53.480]  offender has been reading to children at a houston public library as part of its drag queen story
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:03:02.280]  out secret but sick of sick of sick of sick of sick of sick of this what can i wake up in what
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:06.920]  this world come to. Some people consider it provocative. It's not inappropriate.
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.720]  There is now a push to normalize pedophilia. This is going to be marketed to children.
[1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.520]  It's going to sexualize children. It's going to tell girls they can be boys,
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:22.360]  boys they can be girls. And it's the same kids that they just forced to watch the
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:27.000]  Cardi B softcore porn video. And so this is just a big demonic exercise.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.240]  It'll make me feel liberated right here on her privates. And if you push those,
[1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:37.880]  she makes these sounds. Now, does anybody in this room know how to twerk?
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:43.080]  I couldn't even get through one episode of Big Mouth. I mean, it's literally children having
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:48.360]  the raunchiest, most disgusting, sex sexually oriented conversation. Yeah, yeah, let's get the
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:55.880]  cream. I've got the cream. It will never be okay as much as Hollywood wants it to be. Under MK
[1:03:55.880 --> 1:04:01.640]  Ultra, they experimented on children. We were even taught this in psychophysiology program that if you
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:07.400]  get to a child between ages one and six or one or eight, especially with sexual abuse or sexual
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:12.760]  trauma, you will split their personality and they will be imprinted the rest of their life.
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:18.440]  And many times that results in split personalities and disassociated behavior and other things.
[1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:22.840]  And that's why it takes critical thinking that people have got to look at this stuff critically
[1:04:22.840 --> 1:04:26.920]  and see what they're being fed so they can cross that psychological line that they just
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:33.320]  refuse to see it when it's right in front of them. People that blow the whistle on elite pedophiles
[1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:41.160]  tend to have accidents. We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing
[1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:56.200]  of diversity and inclusivity.
[1:04:59.240 --> 1:05:03.480]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, the Washington Post, or Howard Stern,
[1:05:03.480 --> 1:05:06.840]  of a group you name it, they come out and they attack him full war saying,
[1:05:06.840 --> 1:05:13.320]  Jones claims civil war is coming and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses.
[1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:16.840]  And he tells people they should get off the grid and get prepared and have
[1:05:16.840 --> 1:05:21.880]  horrible food if they can. And now everything I've warned people about is coming true
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:27.720]  because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents like lockstep. This is the corporate
[1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:33.480]  planetary takeover. So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago,

[1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:29.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are so many leftist false flags
[1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:38.040]  being conducted. It makes your head spin. And then there are so many cases of Democrats in
[1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:43.720]  Antifa and Black Lives Matter attacking, burning things down, engaging criminal activity.
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:50.680]  I can't even watch them all every day. I mean, I spent hours today, at least three hours researching.
[1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:59.560]  Probably more. And that's on a Sunday. Usually it's more on a weekday. And there are hundreds of
[1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:05.640]  vicious clips and leftist assaults on people that I don't even have time to watch myself
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:12.280]  so that I can properly cover it. And then we've got the incredible outrageous going on
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:21.800]  which are beyond hypocrisy. Here's the article infowar.com. Hypocrisy. Governor Cuomo
[1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:30.920]  to exempt celebrities from quarantine to attend MTV Music Awards.
[1:07:30.920 --> 1:07:39.160]  Now remember, they're telling pro police rallies can't happen. They're saying churches can't be
[1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:44.600]  open. Cynagogues can't be open. Moss can't be open. A couple weeks ago, they were going to have an
[1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:51.000]  NRA sponsored deal for the police with Ted Nugent and a member of Congress. And Cuomo said do not
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:59.640]  fly in or I will lock you up for 14 days under our quarantine law. But MTV can do what they want
[1:07:59.640 --> 1:08:05.880]  because it's all about the power. It's all about the control.
[1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:13.480]  Meanwhile, everywhere I go, I shake people's hands. Most people are awake now that I've
[1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:18.440]  run into but I still get the FU Russian agent, you're going to prison, you're going to die,
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:22.360]  we're going to get you, we're going to get your family. Roger Stone just texted me this.
[1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:28.600]  Pastor believes church vandalized because of scheduled Roger Stone appearance.
[1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:40.840]  And then the news, the local TV WSMV just links to where it says repent. But no,
[1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:45.640]  it says F Roger Stone, fascist beware, we're going to get Roger Stone.
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:57.240]  And this is why Allen West and other Republicans are going to be having an event coming up next
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:02.600]  weekend in Austin. And they're not going to announce where it is until the morning of,
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:06.120]  you have to sign up for email because the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas,
[1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:10.760]  a great guy by the way, and Pat Green and others that are coming to Rick Green,
[1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:16.440]  they're going to have to have the meeting basically in secret because it'll be attacked.
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:20.040]  That's what it's turned into in this country.
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:28.520]  Meanwhile, Twitter censors Trump tweet about voter security disaster
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:39.640]  that we're going to hit coming up next segment because it's pouring out in the news right now.
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:45.960]  That everywhere they're having these mail-in ballots already come in, it's a total disaster
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:50.600]  because it's not like an absentee ballot where you sign up for it, you get it, you know it's you.
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:54.360]  They're just randomly bombing the country with them and all these Democrat,
[1:09:54.360 --> 1:10:00.040]  blue states and blue cities just randomly mailing millions of them out knowing full well the postal
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:04.360]  workers, most of them are leftist, they've already been caught engaged in fraud, they just busted one
[1:10:04.360 --> 1:10:12.200]  changing the names this week on ballots from Republican to Democrat so that they can carry all
[1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:20.040]  of this out. It's out of control, ladies and gentlemen. And then you see all the footage,
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:25.960]  like the footage we saw of the woman attacking the seven-year-old boy and stealing his hat and
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:31.080]  then physically attacking the mother, the female who stole seven-year-old boys, make America great
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:41.160]  again, hat, harassed his mother, has been arrested for robbery. But let's get back to that false flag.
[1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:53.320]  Sumter mayoral candidate fakes kidnapping, beating WLTX News. And you know, I'm tempted to not just
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:58.200]  play the clip of her faking it. Let's play some of the newscast because we should play
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:05.080]  Benny Hill music or something in the background. Investigators say Sabrina Bletcher staged her
[1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:10.680]  kidnapping and beating to try to get sympathy and more votes in the November election. So she
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:21.160]  actually staged the fake event. Now remember, I'm being sued by Georgetown University in the
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:26.360]  Vatican for saying Charlottesville was totally staged by them. I didn't say that. I said they
[1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:31.080]  had Republicans and some white supremacists with Democrats clash with Antifa knowing there'd be
[1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:37.560]  an explosion and the police herded them together. But they want to make the idea illegal or you'll
[1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:45.720]  be sued uncivil. If you question that Democrats, whether it's Bubba Wallace or Jesse Smollett
[1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:48.440]  or the hundreds of other cases, thousands of cases we know of,
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:55.240]  happen. But everybody knows Democrats are masters of this. Everybody understands that.
[1:11:56.920 --> 1:11:58.200]  So here's some of that newscast.
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:08.520]  Developing tonight out of Sumter, police say a mayoral candidate faked a kidnapping attempt
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:14.680]  in a video she posted online. Investigators say Sabrina Beltcher staged the kidnapping
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:20.040]  and had someone fake a beating to try and get sympathy and more votes in the November election.
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:25.480]  Officers say Beltcher called them Tuesday night saying she was assaulted and kidnapped
[1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:30.520]  during an attempted robbery. Beltcher is charged with filing a false police report.
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:33.640]  Christopher James Edie is charged with conspiracy.
[1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:40.520]  So if you want to know the type of folks, black, white, old, young, Hispanic, you name it, that
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:45.720]  are Democrats, it's these people. And the psychological studies in Europe, the U.S., Canada,
[1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:49.960]  also the same thing. Depending on the study, six to nine times more likely to steal.
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:56.840]  Five to 10 to 15 times more likely to virtue signal and say they're giving the charity but
[1:12:56.840 --> 1:13:03.240]  aren't giving the charity. Way more likely to destroy a workplace. All the studies show that
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:08.840]  a leftist or a liberal will act like they care about a workplace, but will actively work to
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:16.520]  create disharmony and destroy it. They're also very, very unproductive. They're babies. They're
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:26.440]  slobs. They're chumps. They're scammers. And they take your goodwill as weakness and they always
[1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:36.920]  expand the fraud. But they believe that they are the good guys. Roger Stone just sent us a video
[1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:41.000]  exclusively. I was just talking to him during the break to see if we could come on. He can't come on
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:45.080]  right now, but he sent a video about the church he was going to be speaking at. They got vandalized
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:49.000]  and had sprayed all over a traitor. We're going to kill Roger Stone, you name it. But again,
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:53.240]  the local news did to show that. They just said, oh, preacher thinks somebody sprayed on the building
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:58.280]  and put repent because of Roger. No, it says it's because of Roger. And you know
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:04.520]  conservatives and right wingers did not stage a false flag. When have we ever been caught doing it?
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:08.440]  Because we don't do it. Literally. I don't know of a case. Take what happened in
[1:14:08.440 --> 1:14:15.000]  Austin a few months ago. They were, Antifa was burning the homeless camp. We got video.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:19.800]  So national news, mainline TV, local TV said, we did it.
[1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:26.760]  God strike me down if we did that. We, of course, we didn't do that. Antifa did it. But remember
[1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:32.440]  just a month ago, Antifa cannot commit a crime. Antifa has never done anything wrong.
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:37.800]  I've got Roger actually sent me the photos. If they're not at the news, I'll show the photos
[1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:44.440]  in a moment. I'll pull them up. Go ahead and play Roger's response. This is Roger Stone. The US Senate
[1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:51.560]  Intelligence Committee report on their rushing collusion investigation is out and it has 1098
[1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:57.240]  individual references to me. If you count the footnotes, the problem is that virtually all of
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:15:03.400]  them are wrong. For example, the committee assessed that I spoke multiple times with
[1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:08.920]  candidate Donald Trump regarding WikiLeaks assessed. That's the word that the intelligence
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:14.360]  agencies use when they have a theory that they can't prove when they believe something is true,
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:20.360]  but they have no evidence for it. In this case, it's just wrong. Like most of this report, it's
[1:15:22.760 --> 1:15:26.360]  And again, we're live. Things are breaking. Like we went to Trump earlier.
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:31.400]  He is sending me something on what happened to the church. That was a separate thing he sent
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:36.600]  us. So we'll have all that. Okay, I'm gonna look at the election fraud and the conditioned riots
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:41.000]  and the media trying to cover it up, call it peaceful and the latest unfolding on that front.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:46.920]  71 days out. By the way, we're going to be here seven days a week starting Monday.
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:51.560]  So pray for the crew. We've tried to expand. We've been unable to. So the skeleton crew is

[1:15:54.600 --> 1:16:01.960]  a new show. We'll tell you about coming up. It was a sleeper product. It wasn't popular at first,

[1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:10.600]  but world government is only the control grid. Now, inner members of the cult are told that
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:15.960]  they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality, but the price for that is to
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:23.000]  carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms. That's why they say carbon is
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:30.200]  bad. They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet. They are playing god. They believe
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:36.200]  they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:41.960]  to carry out this transformation. I know this sounds insane, but if you read the writings of
[1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:49.720]  the globalist it's all on record. You have been warned. You have been given the information
[1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:56.600]  to say no to this plan. This is the end of all life on earth as we know it. This is the alien

[1:19:50.120 --> 1:20:04.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:22.840]  Live.
[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:29.240]  Live from Austin, Texas. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:32.760 --> 1:20:36.360]  All right. I usually watch the video clips that I'm going to play on the show,
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:42.600]  but Darren McGreen and Rob Do and of course the other great video editors like Drew and
[1:20:42.600 --> 1:20:50.200]  Drew. Gregory's just do such a good jobs that a lot of times I'll just see a new clip they've made
[1:20:50.200 --> 1:20:54.600]  is in the folder. I'll know what the subject is. I have a little write up and I'll play it.
[1:20:56.120 --> 1:21:00.680]  There's kind of a no man's land. The first five minutes of every hour, a lot of stations carry
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:05.480]  news. So we're so big on the internet. We just do our own five minutes right there for the TV
[1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:10.840]  and radio satellites and then for the internet. Well, we played that little two and a half minute
[1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:14.680]  clip that I guess is up at Band-On Video. I didn't see it there. Let's go to the Darren McGreen
[1:21:14.680 --> 1:21:22.600]  section and see what it is. I saw it in the first segment of this hour and it just blew me away.
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:29.320]  Pito Groomers from hell. And it ties into another video he put out this week that I
[1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:34.600]  requested he put together. Trump Religious Hell on Pedophile Networks.
[1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:41.080]  Well, the two videos are both powerful. They go together. I'm going to air those together
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:46.520]  for the full audience in the last segment of this hour, the last segment of today's show
[1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:52.760]  coming up in about 20 minutes, doing about 30 minutes because it's so incredible. I mean,
[1:21:53.720 --> 1:21:58.520]  here's the problem and it's how the enemy starts to win. I have gotten to the point,
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:04.280]  I admitted this on Friday, that when they do the Pedophile Storytime and the new Pedophile TV shows,
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:11.400]  four kids, they're so bad that I can't watch it. I mean, like, oh, this kid's a top. He likes to
[1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:16.680]  have sex with other kids. And then it's a guy dressed like a woman leading a nine-year-old boy
[1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:24.520]  into a dirty mattress and then they close the door. And I mean, that's another video you're
[1:22:24.520 --> 1:22:30.760]  showing. Just don't show any of it for right now. And that image Friday we showed them
[1:22:30.760 --> 1:22:38.840]  leading a little kid into the dungeon. But we're supposed to look at that. We're supposed to see
[1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:46.920]  that so we can stop it. But they know what they're doing. They're just flaunting it and rubbing it
[1:22:46.920 --> 1:22:53.240]  in. So yeah, there it is. Look at that photo of that monster man dressed up like a hit the clown.
[1:22:54.120 --> 1:22:57.320]  He's not biting that kid's arm off of the kid, reaches down on the gutter to get his
[1:22:57.320 --> 1:23:04.520]  paper boat. He's taking him in with his tentacles right into his nest. And just look at that face.
[1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:11.080]  Look at that. God Almighty. And it's in the Netflix show. I read the transcript and I watched,
[1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:15.160]  actually watched it last Thursday night when the article came out. And
[1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:22.600]  you're not supposed to see that and then not go get, you know, torches and light them up and go
[1:23:22.600 --> 1:23:26.520]  attack people. I mean, that's what the natural thing to do is when predators are grabbing
[1:23:26.520 --> 1:23:30.040]  children and doing it, but when they dangle it out there in front of you and laugh at you,
[1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:33.640]  it's designed to demoralize you and break your will. Well, it's not going to happen.
[1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:37.640]  You're going to go to prison. You globalists are going to pay. Your pedophile networks are going down.
[1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:43.240]  And you think you're going to cover it up. You think you're going to get away with it
[1:23:43.240 --> 1:23:47.960]  on one level while you're promoting it on the other level. The dog's not going to hunt.
[1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:55.080]  So I'll cover it in the last segment.
[1:23:57.720 --> 1:24:00.840]  And I'm going to tie it into all these Democrat women coming out and saying,
[1:24:00.840 --> 1:24:05.160]  you're monsters. You're involved with the rape of women. They're involved in pedophilia too.
[1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:11.880]  But Rose McGowan's come out and even Alyssa Milano's come out. They're just,
[1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:16.600]  they're realizing that also, not so much Rose McGowan, I respect her,
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:19.480]  but people like Alyssa Milano realize her own constituents hate her.
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:23.720]  They know she's covering up, making it all about the Me Too movement, all about Republicans. Give
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:32.360]  me a break. The average Republican is a Dudley Do Right turtle compared to the Democrats. I mean,
[1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:39.720]  the Democrats go from bad to worse, man. They are devil worshiping trash. Hollywood is a bottomless
[1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:47.640]  pit of decadence. Now let's get into the really important election fraud news right now. Look
[1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:54.200]  at this story. Facebook braces itself for Trump to cast doubt on election results.
[1:24:55.640 --> 1:25:01.320]  And Facebook says they have a kill switch in place where none of Trump's supporters or Trump
[1:25:01.320 --> 1:25:06.360]  will be able to contest. Only Democrats are allowed to contest basically.
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:14.120]  And you see the talking point. Oh, we're going to contest, the Democrats say, but if Trump
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:20.280]  contest any of their admitted fraud, well, he's a dictator and he needs to be removed.
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:24.040]  And anyone that stands with him will be put in prison for Washington Post headline rent.
[1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:29.320]  So they're getting this ready. They're preparing it. And then sending out millions of
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:33.880]  random ballots to random people without even having names on them,
[1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:39.720]  in many cases, to just see what type of hell they can create to gum up the voting system.
[1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:47.240]  And then again, if you question that, you're bad. Meanwhile, the controlled media is like,
[1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:54.040]  oh, there's no fraud. There's never been any fraud. Look at this big story out of the Detroit news.
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:26:01.160]  Detroit absentee ballot chaos. So inaccurate, we can't even attempt to make right.
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:07.160]  Wayne County and others are reporting total devastation. It just clogged everything up.
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:09.800]  Wrong names, wrong addresses, a disaster.
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:17.560]  Mission accomplished in the States. Trump won. Mission accomplished. And then they say, oh,
[1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:22.440]  he's taken away all the mailboxes. Obama signed those orders. It's ongoing as they downsize the
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:29.080]  post office. That's a fraud. But see, they just confuse it where the public thinks it's Trump
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:34.120]  election meddling when it's the deep staters. Here's another one. New Jersey election invalidated
[1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:41.720]  over rampant voter fraud, which I was told doesn't happen in the United States.
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:49.720]  But now they're reporting in New Jersey. It is absolutely rampant and massive frauds being
[1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:55.080]  discovered. There's a big article from townhall.com that details other town hall article. It's a video.
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:27:01.080]  Watch RNC chairwoman explains the real problem the GOP has with mail-in voting. And she explains
[1:27:01.080 --> 1:27:06.680]  that it's random. It's the people's houses that are wrong. It's to create confusion. It's not
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:11.400]  about the post office. It's that they're sending ballots to unverified voter rolls,
[1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:17.000]  McDaniel said. And then she goes through how it's clearly for fraud. Yeah.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:25.400]  Yeah. Meanwhile, no bump chump. Biden suffers same fate as loser John Kerry and George McGovern
[1:27:25.400 --> 1:27:30.920]  in post DNC polls. And that's even with their rigged polls that give him an average of 10 points
[1:27:30.920 --> 1:27:37.400]  or more. Remember, pollsters always give 10 to 15 points advantage to Democrats because it's assumed
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:45.320]  in the methodology that Democrats have more voters. Really? Okay. The frauds baked into the cake.
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:57.240]  Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi passes USPS bill to block common sense legislation to help workers.
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:02.920]  They don't even need the $25 million, but they're just ramming it through to act like Trump was
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:08.040]  trying to sabotage it. So leftist fetishize that there are ballots out in their mailbox,
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:12.360]  so they fill them out, their neighbors fill them out, and they engage in good old fashioned fraud.
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:16.840]  As Democrats have shown, they'll commit crime. They'll beat up children in broad daylight.
[1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:22.360]  They'll burn down police stations and shoot people that don't stop their cars at BLM
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:27.640]  Antifa checkpoints. They're lawless. They don't care. Of course, they're going to engage in massive
[1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.600]  voter fraud, which was done by the Democrats in mass, making an organized election meddling and
[1:28:32.600 --> 1:28:39.160]  election fraud. All right, we hit that. We got a bunch of political correctness news,
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:45.480]  a bunch of globalist news, and some more breaking COVID-19 news. Is Trump really planning to try to
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:51.960]  make us take a vaccine? I don't believe so. And I know the inside baseball, I'll tell you that.
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:55.400]  But still, it's a very dangerous road. He's taking us down. We'll cover it straight ahead.
[1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:04.600]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good for your
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:10.440]  heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep. It's amazing.

[1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:01.640]  I talked to the EMS and I talked to the medical doctors and what makes you nauseated is he's
[1:30:01.640 --> 1:30:06.120]  not just the smell of piss, but we call the smell of bum piss that has that sweet nauseating smell.

[1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:08.840]  The New World Order Chai-Com Globalist Syndicate is making its move to implode the dollar
[1:31:08.840 --> 1:31:14.040]  and thrust the United States into a civil war by contesting the election. They are openly
[1:31:14.040 --> 1:31:18.120]  wargaming this at the highest levels of the Democratic Party. Nancy Pelosi and others have
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:24.040]  gone on television and said they will contest the election. Trump is going. They will hold a separate
[1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:29.400]  inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and that anyone challenging that will be called a racist.
[1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:34.360]  They will then trigger race riots and violence. They've already beta tested around the country.
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:39.480]  We are not living in normal times. When these type of things happen in history,
[1:31:39.480 --> 1:31:44.440]  people are usually caught flat footed because they can't believe they're living in such a criminal
[1:31:44.440 --> 1:31:49.240]  era. We are. We are living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate that's been
[1:31:49.240 --> 1:31:54.600]  feeding on America is being exposed and removed. Now is the time for all good men and women to
[1:31:54.600 --> 1:31:59.160]  come to their aid of the country. Spread the word now, Paul Revere's. Constantly,
[1:31:59.160 --> 1:32:03.800]  whether it's the New York Times, The Washington Post, or Howard Stern of a blue name, and they
[1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:09.640]  come out and they attack Infowars saying, Jones claims civil wars coming and financial collapse
[1:32:09.640 --> 1:32:15.160]  and planetary lockdowns using viruses. And he tells people they should get off the grid and get
[1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:20.520]  prepared and have storable food if they can. And now everything I've warned people about is coming
[1:32:20.520 --> 1:32:26.440]  true because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents like lockstep. This is the
[1:32:26.440 --> 1:32:32.680]  corporate planetary takeover. So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago,

[1:33:25.880 --> 1:33:38.440]  But my hand was made strong by the end of the almighty. We forward in this generation.
[1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:51.880]  Triumph and plea. Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom. Well, you live to see it.
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:56.040]  The New World Order. Globalists making their move on the Republic on you,
[1:33:56.760 --> 1:33:59.880]  on your family and on everything we've ever had or ever will be.
[1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:09.000]  Real evil, real tyranny. Okay, let's let's lay it out here. I am not a Trumpophile.
[1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:15.400]  I have gotten nothing but blood, sweat, tears and pain for supporting President Trump.
[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:22.600]  And I would do it all again over pretty much the same way.
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:28.760]  I know a lot about Trump. I know of the inside baseball.
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:32.680]  I know that Trump fundamentally believes in not destroying this country.
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:38.120]  I know there have been massive campaigns of harassment and targeting
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:41.960]  against everyone prominent who has supported President Trump.
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:45.480]  And so that's why you've seen people like his sister, a federal judge,
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:48.200]  be part of these operations against him.
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:56.280]  And what did Trump say when his sister helped run that operation against him and didn't come
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:01.720]  to his brother's funeral? He said, man, I sure miss my brother, Robert.
[1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:07.720]  And I'm really sad about the things people close to me have said, but it's okay.
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:14.120]  I forgive them. Everybody can see what we've done and how we try to turn things around and you judge
[1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:25.160]  a tree by its fruits. And so I don't care. And you know, they really fought like the devil to
[1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:29.800]  keep Trump away from me because Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have done a great job advising
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:35.640]  the president. Because Trump really sees himself as a talk show host. He just wants to be a guy
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:39.640]  that talks to people, has ideas, cheerleads America, and that's what he says he is.
[1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:45.080]  But I've talked to Trump many times and it's kind of ridiculous. I mean, I guess he did what I
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:48.760]  told him to. I mean, I told him a couple of times, I said, sir, you don't need to tell me how great
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:52.280]  I am. I just want you to know I appreciate you. You need to really go after the deep state,
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:59.880]  respond on your other evil. And Trump's called up my wife. He's told the people, you know,
[1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:07.800]  to my family and said, man, Alex is a real man. You're lucky to have him. He's really strong.
[1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:12.840]  There's not a lot of guys like that. And Trump doesn't tell average people stuff like that,
[1:36:12.840 --> 1:36:16.840]  folks. He'll tell firefighters that have been fighting for two weeks, great firefighters,
[1:36:16.840 --> 1:36:20.360]  you know, battling giant blazes who've just lost some of their people. He'll tell them stuff like
[1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:27.560]  that. That's who Trump admires is people in the arena. And Trump knows what they've done to me
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:35.000]  and this audience who supports us. And Trump understands that brotherhood, that that kinship
[1:36:35.800 --> 1:36:42.120]  that you only get when you're standing for what's right. But most people when they call up and
[1:36:42.120 --> 1:36:47.560]  threaten your family, sue your family, dig up dirt that's real or made up, depending on the case.
[1:36:47.560 --> 1:36:56.760]  Most people say, Hey, I'm giving up. And so Trump's found out who his friends are.
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:01.080]  And there was enemies are and you found out who your friends are who your enemy are.
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:05.480]  And a lot of people I thought were bad ended up being good when the crunch time came.
[1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:10.600]  And a lot of people I thought were good ended up being bad when crunch time came.
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:15.800]  And we're in crunch time, folks. We've been in crunch time for five years.
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:20.440]  It's going to get more intense no matter what happens to Trump. But I know this surrendering
[1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:24.920]  to these globalist Satanist is not going to get us out of the situation we're in.
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:27.480]  It's going to make it a hundred times worse. I mean a hundred times worse.
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:32.920]  So I'm not taking these monsters on because I'm some tough guy full of
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:39.400]  hoodspot or bovrada or machismo or whatever you want to call it. I'm doing it because I know I'm
[1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:44.840]  in danger and you're in danger and my family's in danger. And in my life, when somebody comes
[1:37:44.840 --> 1:37:49.080]  down on me with a ton of bricks for no reason, I fight back because that feels natural.
[1:37:50.600 --> 1:37:55.880]  I don't do this because it's something I decided to do. I do it because it's who I am.
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:03.480]  And I know that's who you are. So that's why we don't need to tell each other we love each other
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:08.600]  when you call in. You don't have to thank me. We're like blood going through the veins of this
[1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:13.880]  planet together. We are together. We want freedom. We're the same thing. I don't need to look in
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:18.680]  the mirror and tell myself, I appreciate me. I appreciate you. We appreciate each other. It's
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:27.400]  done. We need to take on the new world order and defeat them. Now that said, I've learned how
[1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:31.560]  Trump operates and I think it's a dangerous game and I don't really agree with it because it's not
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:37.000]  how my brain operates. That's where Trump and I are different or we're alike in a lot of ways.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:44.360]  I know how to use reverse psychology on the globalist and I've accidentally done it a few times
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:48.680]  and watched him take the bait immediately and it was spectacularly successful, but it's like the
[1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:57.880]  ring of Mordor. You put it on over time. It always bites you in the ass. Trump is playing third
[1:38:57.880 --> 1:39:03.160]  dimensional chess. People sit around and say he's an idiot. No, he's not. He's got incredible instincts.
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:07.480]  Sometimes he tunes out from people or acts like he's dumb and that's not what's going on.
[1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:13.240]  And so I remember sitting around in the office six months ago with Owen Schreuer,
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:18.280]  and I think David Knight was in the, we were like, do we use reverse psychology?
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:23.960]  Do we say we're for the vaccine so Democrats are now against it? And I said, no, they'll just ignore
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:31.000]  us. They want control of our bodies. It's about the population. But I said, I expect Trump will
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.800]  probably pull something like that because I just, I get in the zone sometimes and I go,
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:39.800]  he'll probably come out and say, you don't have to take it. He's concerned about it. A lot of
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:44.360]  people are worried about it to let us know he knows. That's his pattern. He'll tell us he knows.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:50.840]  He understands. Then he'll come out and endorse it and try to rush it knowing that they want to
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:55.080]  get rid of him first and then have Bill Gates be the hero and then have Democrats in control and
[1:39:55.080 --> 1:39:59.400]  really crack down and really force it on us. But by him taking it on, it makes them in their
[1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:05.480]  constituents turn against it and then he can get a vaccine that's less bad and watch. He'll say,
[1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:10.040]  only old people should take it because that's who it kills. And then he's like, hey, let the old
[1:40:10.040 --> 1:40:16.200]  people, they're dumb enough to take it, die. It's free will. Well, he did exactly what I said in
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:21.240]  the break room to Owen. And I said all that on there too. You can say, well, Trump heard that
[1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:25.960]  and did that. No, that's not what's going on here. It's a little bit more complex and cooler than that.
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:32.120]  So it's a spirit, folks. Now, I can see that. I just don't do that myself. And it's because I'm
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:39.800]  so I even start expressing anything Machiavellian, even for good, it starts to taint my vision. And
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:45.960]  I don't know how Trump does it. And he's a different animal. But I'm neurotically, I'm just
[1:40:45.960 --> 1:40:51.720]  straightforward, just absolutely. This is it. This is how it is because I and sometimes I don't
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:55.880]  know what's going on. I'll tell you talk show host is never not supposed to know what's going on. I
[1:40:55.880 --> 1:41:00.440]  don't know what's going on. I'll tell you my windshield's fogged up. I got to pull over now.
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:06.840]  That said, this is really dangerous. What Trump's doing because he says, oh, maybe I'll get the UK
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:11.880]  fast track vaccine over here to kind of kill the debate, say it's here and then see what happens.
[1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:17.320]  Well, they can easily give him one of the painted ones or the ones Gates has. You make 80% sick.
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:23.480]  20% I go to the hospital. That's the weak version. 100% get sick. Some like 42% go to the hospital.
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:27.400]  I was doing like what are they doing coming out when they admits that bad? They usually cover it
[1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:30.840]  up. It's because they know they can't cover it up. This is their big move, folks. They want to
[1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:35.960]  just normalize this. So Putin did the same thing. He came out with a vaccine that's very weak and
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:41.400]  said, okay, we're handled. We're saved because he knows the media made the vaccine king. He knows
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:45.160]  the vaccine internationally is going to be tainted and sterilize the Russians like the
[1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:49.240]  globals that already did under the Soviets. And so I knew what Putin was doing when he came out.
[1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:53.880]  And then of course, the U.S. is like, we can't trust it. It's poison. It'll get us even better.
[1:41:53.880 --> 1:41:59.400]  Now we're talking about poison vaccines. So I get the Hegelian dialectic Psiop stuff that's
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:05.560]  going on. And I get that some of our people are going to use those dark arts to defeat Satan.
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:11.640]  I just don't know if that type of psychology, I don't want to call it darkness, but it's getting
[1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:20.360]  damn close to it. So we'll see what happens. Time will tell. The forces with Trump and I know God's
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:25.320]  with him and I know Trump is dialed in. I know he knows Baron got damaged by it, but this vaccine
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:29.720]  will not protect you. Gates even had mentioned, but says you're going to take it so you can travel
[1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:34.200]  on an airplane or have a job. They're just saying, hey, it's not even going to work. We have liability
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:37.480]  protection. And if you want to step one foot outside your door, you're going to take it.
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:42.840]  That's what this is really about is the global social credit score. All right. Incredibly horrifying
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:48.360]  bottom of the snake pit, pedo information where they openly declare they're going to have sex with
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:53.240]  your children on Netflix with children on the shows. We're going to play this coming up. It's
[1:42:53.240 --> 1:43:02.840]  just the right thing to do. Incrementalism, the inchworm effect, successive approximation.
[1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:07.720]  First, they tell you only stay in your house for 15 days to the hospitals can stay empty.
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:13.000]  That was all a fraud. Then we're a mask for a month. Here we are six months later. Then they
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:18.840]  start making people at colleges and at big corporations where wristbands showing that
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:24.920]  they've been quote, contact traced and tested for COVID. Then comes the apps on your phones
[1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:30.200]  and the global social credit score now being rolled out by Virginia, California and others.
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:34.840]  It's not coming. It's here. And then the inoculations. If you ever want to leave your
[1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:41.080]  house, which amounts to force inoculations, this is the medical tyranny takeover. These are not
[1:43:41.080 --> 1:43:46.440]  classic vaccines that have their own problems. These are DNA vaccines that change your DNA and
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:53.000]  are having massive serious side effects guaranteed. This is about depopulation. Bill Gates admits
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:44:00.920]  that this is an emergency. Resist or die. The new order is here. It was a sleeper product. It wasn't
[1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:05.560]  popular at first, but as people tried it, it's become one of our top five best sellers. I'm
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:11.000]  talking about the eight pack power stack 13 different pills filled with super nutrients,

[1:51:00.840 --> 1:51:10.920]  now the me too movement is a democrat party movement where they say all sex is rape men
[1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:16.600]  are bad if a guy asks you out it's rape Gillette runs ads where a guy asks a girl out it's rape
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:21.080]  men aren't supposed to talk to women we're all supposed to stay separate kind of a beta test
[1:51:21.080 --> 1:51:25.320]  for the whole covid lockdown it's down here they want to separate as prisoners under their control
[1:51:25.320 --> 1:51:31.480]  and then it distracts from all the real u n run sex slavery it distracts from all the
[1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:37.320]  pedophilia being promoted the giant sex rings being busted and all this national news saying
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:42.680]  trumps crazy it doesn't exist and first they tried the whole pizza gate thing to say that nothing
[1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:47.400]  exists and now they say oh because a few people poses the cue movement not all the cues bad
[1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:52.280]  and and and say things that aren't true that can be disproven no kids are being kidnapped
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:57.640]  everyone's siding with this is sick and evil and part of a larger cover-up so here's two reports
[1:51:57.640 --> 1:52:02.760]  together that are incredibly important and incredibly powerful that are also posted at
[1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:08.840]  banned out video that hope you'll share the dnc ladies and gentlemen is part of this evil group
[1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:15.800]  so here it is pedo gropers from hell the dove tells with trump unleashes hell on child traffickers
[1:52:15.800 --> 1:52:23.640]  here are the reports together this is going to be the grooming of the next generation that's the
[1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:28.200]  whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to
[1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:33.800]  seeing it now the woman gets up on her table spreads her legs it's a man this is adult entertainment
[1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:38.760]  but what do predators do they target children start them young right breaking news we have just
[1:52:38.760 --> 1:52:43.800]  confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a houston public
[1:52:43.800 --> 1:52:48.840]  library as part of its drag queen story out sicker but sick of sick of sick of sick of sick of
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:56.680]  what a alternate universe is this what planet did i wake up in what has this world come to
[1:52:56.680 --> 1:53:02.280]  some people consider provocative it's not inappropriate family programming
[1:53:04.760 --> 1:53:09.080]  there is now a push to normalize pedophilia this is going to be marketed to children
[1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:13.000]  it's going to sexualize children it's going to tell girls they can be boys boys they can be girls
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:18.760]  and and it's the same kids that they just forced to watch the cardi b softcore porn video and so
[1:53:18.760 --> 1:53:23.640]  this is just a big demonic exercise it'll make me feel liberated right here on her privates and if
[1:53:23.640 --> 1:53:33.080]  you push those she makes these sounds now does anybody in this room know how to twerk i couldn't
[1:53:33.080 --> 1:53:37.640]  even get through one episode of bigmouth i mean it's literally children having the raunchiest most
[1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:43.800]  disgusting sex sexually oriented conversation yeah yeah who's got the creep me i've got the cream
[1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:51.160]  it will never be okay as much as hollywood wants it to be under mk ultra they experimented on
[1:53:51.160 --> 1:53:56.680]  children we were even taught this in psychophysiology program that if you get to a child between ages
[1:53:56.680 --> 1:54:02.680]  one and six or one or eight especially with sexual abuse or sexual trauma you will split their
[1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:08.360]  personality and they will be imprinted the rest of their life and many times that results in split
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:13.240]  personalities and disassociated behavior and other things and that's why it takes critical
[1:54:13.240 --> 1:54:18.040]  thinking that people have got to look at this stuff critically and see what they're being fed
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:22.200]  so they can cross that psychological line that they just refuse to to see it when it's right in
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:30.600]  front of them people that blow the whistle on elite pedophiles tend to have accidents we are grooming
[1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:36.280]  the new generation of americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity
[1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:46.200]  you are secretly saving the world from this cytanic
[1:54:46.760 --> 1:54:54.440]  cult of pedophiles and cannibals does that sound like something you are behind well i haven't
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:55:00.840]  i haven't heard that but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing marina abronovic
[1:55:00.840 --> 1:55:07.640]  is a superstar with every weird twisted hollywood dc or new york lowlife
[1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:16.840]  christmas ornaments drywall and jerry epps named three things that don't hang themselves max

[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:33.800]  people think of that as an ancient part there are more human smugglers right now traffickers they call
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:38.200]  that at any time in the history of our world trump has signed executive orders to expand
