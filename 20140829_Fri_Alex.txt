[00:00.000 --> 00:12.140]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.140 --> 00:20.900]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.900 --> 00:33.440]  well it's hard to believe ladies and gentlemen that it's already Friday 29th
[00:33.440 --> 00:40.880]  day of August 2014 we're gonna be live here for the next three hours I'm gonna
[00:40.880 --> 00:55.100]  get my limited crew is they're so busy and so few to go back to the last year
[00:55.100 --> 01:00.200]  and a half where I have basically broken down exactly what would happen
[01:00.200 --> 01:05.400]  hundreds of times so that I can have those clips on the Sunday show this
[01:05.400 --> 01:14.040]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. and the scores of articles by Curtin MO Paul Watson and
[01:14.040 --> 01:22.600]  others where we specifically said the West is arming Al Qaeda changing their
[01:22.600 --> 01:29.080]  name to confuse the public to IS and ISIS and is going to attack the West and
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.460]  that's going to be used as a pretext to take American liberties European
[01:33.460 --> 01:40.080]  liberties and deploy paramilitary on the streets and I've also said over and
[01:40.080 --> 01:46.200]  over again that Obama has taken more vacations than anyone I have ever seen
[01:46.200 --> 01:53.960]  and the media admits that he he breaks the record of even George W. Bush who
[01:53.960 --> 01:57.360]  would take about two and a half months of vacation Obama takes over four months
[01:57.360 --> 02:04.680]  of vacation a year but I said that if he ever comes home from a vacation that's
[02:04.680 --> 02:08.120]  because he doesn't want to get blamed for what's about to happen it's a bad
[02:08.120 --> 02:12.040]  image problem
[02:14.920 --> 02:20.800]  urgent is the drudge report headline Obama to intercept and to interrupt
[02:20.800 --> 02:27.200]  weekend fundraising trip will return to DC was gonna attend a MSNBC wedding and
[02:27.200 --> 02:36.200]  do three fundraisers but he will still attend the MSNBC wedding while UK raises
[02:36.200 --> 02:42.560]  terror threat to severe basically their highest level
[02:44.840 --> 02:52.400]  the FBI has put out a terror alert as well today do you know who's not listed
[02:52.400 --> 03:04.000]  on the terror alert this is how the Washington Times FBI national domestic
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.040]  threat assessment omits Islamist terrorism so they're saying a domestic
[03:09.040 --> 03:15.360]  attack meaning here in the US could happen at any moment but Muslims radical
[03:15.360 --> 03:20.640]  Muslims are not listed you know who is listed right you know the drill we first
[03:20.640 --> 03:27.320]  broke this seven years ago no one believed us mainstream news now even
[03:27.320 --> 03:29.800]  when it was finally the New York Times a week later we got no credit that's
[03:29.800 --> 03:33.080]  fine for people to know we don't we're not making stuff up okay no matter how
[03:33.080 --> 03:44.600]  wild it sounds it's documented I wish I was wrong FBI national domestic threat
[03:44.600 --> 03:56.480]  assessment omits Islamist terrorism Bill Gertz isn't that interesting isn't

[08:43.480 --> 08:47.680]  I want it red-linked when we post this Reuters article with links to our
[08:47.680 --> 08:51.600]  background and research on this I'm gonna add the Ray McGovern video that we
[08:51.600 --> 08:57.240]  reared yesterday to that where he says this could end in nuclear war
[08:57.240 --> 09:04.360]  headline top CIA analyst moving troops into Poland and Ukraine could trigger
[09:04.360 --> 09:10.960]  nuclear war a very good chance of it and now Putin has come out saying don't
[09:10.960 --> 09:16.600]  mess with nuclear Russia Putin says Reuters Vladimir Putin said today just
[09:16.600 --> 09:20.920]  minutes ago we're gonna post the actual Russian transcript at info wars so you
[09:20.920 --> 09:26.080]  get the full thing on Friday Russia's armed forces see why I spent three hours
[09:26.080 --> 09:28.680]  on this yesterday and had people asking why I was there such a big deal of
[09:28.680 --> 09:33.880]  Ukraine because this is a big deal Russian troops are going into Ukraine
[09:33.880 --> 09:38.440]  right now and I don't just sit there and agree with CNN they've been in a proxy
[09:38.440 --> 09:43.280]  battle for six months president Vladimir Putin said on Friday Russia's armed
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.760]  forces backed by its nuclear arsenal we're ready to meet any aggression
[09:47.760 --> 09:52.840]  declaring at a pro-Kremlin youth camp that foreign states can understand its
[09:52.840 --> 09:58.920]  best not to mess with us this is absolutely insane crazy level
[09:58.920 --> 10:06.320]  information Putin told the assembly on the banks of the lake near Moscow that
[10:06.320 --> 10:10.800]  Russian takeover in fact I'll guarantee you this is on RT right now guys go to
[10:10.800 --> 10:14.920]  RT Russia I guarantee it's their top video Putin told the assembly on the
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.920]  banks of the lake near Moscow let's get that on m4s.com as well the Russian
[10:19.920 --> 10:25.760]  takeover of Crimea in March was essential to save a largely Russian
[10:25.760 --> 10:29.120]  speaking population from Ukrainian government violence and they have been
[10:29.120 --> 10:32.640]  there ethnically cleansing him he said continued fighting each in Ukraine
[10:32.640 --> 10:38.360]  where pro-Russian separatists launched a uprising in April was the latest of a
[10:38.360 --> 10:44.360]  reversal and a refusal by Kiev to negotiate
[10:44.360 --> 10:48.400]  Ukraine and Western governments accused Russia of sending troops and armor to
[10:48.400 --> 10:51.400]  back the separatists in a conflict that has already killed over two thousand
[10:51.400 --> 10:55.400]  people Russia denies the charge Russia is far from being involved in any large
[10:55.400 --> 11:00.000]  scale conflicts notice that key word these are asymmetrical skirmishes he
[11:00.000 --> 11:05.240]  said at the camp on the banks of the lake we don't want that and we don't
[11:05.240 --> 11:09.840]  plan it but naturally we should always be ready to repel any aggression towards
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.720]  Russia Russia's partners should understand it's best not to mess with us
[11:14.720 --> 11:21.000]  said Putin dressed casually in a gray sweater and light blue jeans thank God I
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.520]  think no one is thinking of unleashing a large-scale conflict with Russia
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.400]  they're moving US troops mercenaries you name it into Poland and Ukraine with the
[11:29.400 --> 11:32.840]  CI director setting it all up three months ago this is all public they
[11:32.840 --> 11:36.760]  thank God you're not planning something because we have nuclear weapons and we're
[11:36.760 --> 11:42.880]  rolling them up to the border when NATO and and again it's not our government
[11:42.880 --> 11:48.600]  folks it's globalist manipulating this just like they funded al-Qaeda in Iraq
[11:48.600 --> 11:54.000]  and al-Qaeda in Syria is the main force they renamed it IS or ISIS now the
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.440]  political class says brace for terror attack we're about to get hit by al-Qaeda
[11:58.440 --> 12:02.800]  or ISIS highest with terror level alert in England terror level alert in New
[12:02.800 --> 12:10.080]  York City for ISIS and no one's talking about who gave them the weapons just a
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.320]  year ago we had Rand Paul saying we don't want to be the air force for al-Qaeda
[12:15.320 --> 12:22.880]  and Senator Ted Cruz and others and so they had a problem the CFR openly said
[12:22.880 --> 12:25.520]  we have a problem it's coming out that we're working with these people what do
[12:25.520 --> 12:28.880]  we do so they have this whole PR thing of well we can't control them and they
[12:28.880 --> 12:33.320]  are good fighters and Assad is bad but we'll bomb them later and you know we'll
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.000]  take care of the al-Qaeda problem after they've taken care of Assad for us blah
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.320]  blah blah that's why we've given them the weapons and trained them and then our
[12:40.320 --> 12:43.040]  own military came out and said yeah we've been forced to give them weapons and
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.120]  train them and Tosh Plumlee had the Justice Department put a gag order on
[12:47.120 --> 12:52.440]  him he was reporting on C-130 swine arms into the radical Islamist state
[12:52.440 --> 13:00.280]  Shia folks and then we're basically told brace for terror attack brace for
[13:00.280 --> 13:06.040]  terror attack brace for terror attack the al-Qaeda threat the IS threat is
[13:06.040 --> 13:12.800]  real but they were funded protected shepherded by the criminals that have
[13:12.800 --> 13:17.560]  hijacked our country in Europe and many other nations is Putin good no he
[13:17.560 --> 13:25.520]  represents a mafioso type Russian strong arm system where basically the KGB just
[13:25.520 --> 13:28.920]  became the oligarchs instead of the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and the
[13:28.920 --> 13:34.120]  arm and hammer Al Gore dynasty that own the big factories all over Russia our
[13:34.120 --> 13:40.320]  government in 1917 put the Bolsheviks in on record it's declassified gutted the
[13:40.320 --> 13:45.120]  whole country over 30 years Stalin was our big ally Lenin was our ally they
[13:45.120 --> 13:49.240]  were in Time Magazine as saviors even in the mid 30s and late 30s and in the
[13:49.240 --> 13:56.280]  early 40s endorsed publicly given all our major factories built up to take over
[13:56.280 --> 14:00.600]  the world so we could then point the finger and say oh my gosh the commies
[14:00.600 --> 14:04.200]  are taking over we've got to build up a big army to counter them and then that
[14:04.200 --> 14:08.440]  that army took over the rest of the world Jack Spratt can eat no fat his
[14:08.440 --> 14:15.920]  wife can eat no lean in between the two of them they lick the platter clean these
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.600]  are children's nursery rhymes I'm sure the public can understand what's
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.920]  happening here this is so simple and when I talk like that I'm not talking to
[14:24.920 --> 14:28.320]  our general listeners that know more than I do in many cases I'm always
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.640]  amazed by how informed people are I'm talking about the general public the
[14:32.640 --> 14:44.480]  system thinks you're so dumb they think you're so stupid that they would fund
[14:44.480 --> 14:50.160]  al-qaeda protect al-qaeda give them stinger missiles just a year ago for
[14:50.160 --> 14:54.280]  the last four years they've been doing it publicly but for a year it's it's
[14:54.280 --> 14:57.880]  been escalated and then turn right around and say we got to take your rights
[14:57.880 --> 15:00.840]  and have armored vehicles on the street corners and checkpoints everywhere
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.200]  because ISIS is inside the country with stinger missiles and they're about to
[15:04.200 --> 15:12.000]  shoot down you have 20 airliners a day literally if they got a hundred stinger
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.600]  missiles into this country and half of the missile launches were successful
[15:15.600 --> 15:24.480]  you'd be talking about 50 aircraft shot down they were given 15,000 impads many
[15:24.480 --> 15:29.520]  of them more advanced and high-tech than the latest stinger type missiles and you
[15:29.520 --> 15:32.480]  can see the operation terror the globalists are going to launch they
[15:32.480 --> 15:35.680]  could shoot down hundreds and hundreds of aircraft with these in Europe the
[15:35.680 --> 15:40.560]  United States the Middle East the FAA had to suspend during the last Gaza
[15:40.560 --> 15:46.240]  crisis that just ended thank God air flights into Israel because they know
[15:46.240 --> 15:50.480]  there's impads out there so I want to explain this is a real crisis but the
[15:50.480 --> 15:55.200]  global crime syndicate call them chaos call them specter call them Dr. Evil
[15:55.200 --> 15:58.360]  whatever you want to call these groups that are going to make money off weapons
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.040]  sales off the crisis off the insider trading off of knowing what's coming
[16:02.040 --> 16:07.120]  before it happens they literally are using this to destabilize the entire
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.720]  planet and the Russians are not in an offensive posture the communist Chinese
[16:12.720 --> 16:16.480]  backed by the globalist are buying basically up the oil fields worldwide
[16:16.480 --> 16:22.480]  that the rare earth minerals the weapons systems the media systems censoring
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.920]  US media working with Microsoft to censor the internet worldwide in Google
[16:26.920 --> 16:34.320]  China is a real hardcore new world order threat Russia there is some
[16:34.320 --> 16:37.720]  intermediary connections with the globalist the new world order but Russia
[16:37.720 --> 16:42.280]  through sultans in eastern discovered that they've been hijacked by a eugenics
[16:42.280 --> 16:46.600]  program to destroy them that's why communism was put in there because Russia
[16:46.600 --> 16:51.040]  was the only rival to the globalist using the West parasitically as their
[16:51.040 --> 16:56.240]  engine of domination so Shultz and Eastern wrote a bunch of books on this not
[16:56.240 --> 17:01.200]  the one he won the Nobel Prize for gulagurka pelaga and he met repeatedly
[17:01.200 --> 17:05.240]  with Putin now I don't know if Putin's double crossing all that but if you look
[17:05.240 --> 17:09.040]  at Russian radio and TV it's a new world order there's cancer in the vaccines
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.600]  global government they want to kill us have children don't abort your children
[17:13.600 --> 17:20.000]  I mean Russia knows what's going on and just the fact that that's caught on in
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.440]  Russia the new order could start a nuclear war with them you understand
[17:25.440 --> 17:28.360]  that they want to take their gas pipelines they want to take their oil
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.120]  fields they want to take their only port to get stuff out to Europe and they're
[17:32.120 --> 17:38.520]  doing it right now you are seeing what Napoleon and what Hitler did and by the
[17:38.520 --> 17:41.920]  way you notice Obama knows he won't get any trouble the globalists know he's
[17:41.920 --> 17:44.960]  about to sign an executive order that's in the Associated Press to legalize the
[17:44.960 --> 17:51.920]  illegals gonna stop deportations completely he is about to shine us on to
[17:51.920 --> 17:56.080]  the UN and put carbon taxes on basically everything we do outside of law and
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.680]  Rand Paul said the senator said you are not a king well if he doesn't go to
[18:00.680 --> 18:04.400]  jail he is a king and now the establishment sets the precedent to
[18:04.400 --> 18:10.040]  whoever they put in as their puppet dictator will be a dictator in fact an
[18:10.040 --> 18:14.400]  elected dictator because it won't matter once you elect them they act
[18:14.400 --> 18:19.880]  dictatorially so you can see it on every front the globalists are taking down
[18:19.880 --> 18:23.880]  Africa they're taking down Europe they're taking down Latin America they're
[18:23.880 --> 18:27.040]  taking down Asia they are taking everything down I'm skipping this
[18:27.040 --> 18:32.080]  network break it's too important that means our dear station shouldn't be
[18:32.080 --> 18:35.120]  covering the substance of network break this cost us three four thousand dollars
[18:35.120 --> 18:39.520]  every time we skip it but it's that important I'm skipping it ladies and
[18:39.520 --> 18:45.720]  gentlemen do you realize the magnitude of what we're facing stuff is so hard
[18:45.720 --> 18:50.680]  core that it's disrespectful you know they'll have some O.J. Simpson verdict
[18:50.680 --> 18:54.360]  or they'll have some hyped up Miley Cyrus thing and talk radio will suspend
[18:54.360 --> 19:00.360]  commercials for a whole day sometimes I feel like ought to suspend him period we
[19:00.360 --> 19:04.200]  ought to be on our knees everybody should be at church right now praying to
[19:04.200 --> 19:09.000]  God that this Cuban Missile Crisis part two comes to an end but this time it's
[19:09.000 --> 19:15.680]  not the evil communist Russians trying to put missiles in Cuba it is the West
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.200]  moving missiles to shoot down their missiles so there can be a first strike
[19:19.200 --> 19:24.240]  on Russia and Russia sees the missile cruisers coming in they see the systems
[19:24.240 --> 19:29.480]  to shoot down their response strike they see the mercenaries al-Qaeda being turned
[19:29.480 --> 19:33.640]  loose all over their borders from Chechnya you know right through to Russia
[19:33.640 --> 19:40.840]  proper blowing stuff up and it's Western backed they don't even hide the fact
[19:40.840 --> 19:47.920]  that the CIA is arming al-Qaeda groups to attack Russia so you can see the mass of
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.920]  double-cross and again they're shutting off our power they're shutting off our
[19:51.920 --> 19:55.840]  jobs they're shutting down our coal power plants there they're passing more
[19:55.840 --> 19:59.120]  taxes here to shut us down just those are sanctions
[19:59.120 --> 20:04.280]  Obamacare is a sanction on our medical care system on the average person and
[20:04.280 --> 20:09.680]  seven taxes on blue collar workers and poor people and a total of 20 plus taxes
[20:09.680 --> 20:17.440]  on record you're now feeling it you're now seeing it same thing with Russia so
[20:17.440 --> 20:21.920]  we have a lot of solidarity with the Russian people and the people of the EU
[20:21.920 --> 20:26.520]  who are being hurt by these sanctions it's hurting our markets but the
[20:26.520 --> 20:29.440]  globalists don't care because they're going to be the last men standing when
[20:29.440 --> 20:35.320]  they consolidated the global economy and Putin has gone call Ray McGovern see
[20:35.320 --> 20:41.800]  we can get him on who I want to get an analyst on about this right now because
[20:41.800 --> 20:47.880]  if they see a missile fired into their territory Russia will launch on warning
[20:47.880 --> 20:52.760]  is the default and it will be the end of the world as we know it and or a large
[20:52.760 --> 20:59.200]  portion of the earth will die like out of revelations or something you don't
[20:59.200 --> 21:01.880]  hear a lot about America in revelations do you it's like we're going to be blown
[21:01.880 --> 21:05.000]  away why are all the elite leaving the country I'm not saying this is going to
[21:05.000 --> 21:10.320]  happen but let me tell you it is in the cards it's like Russian roulette ladies
[21:10.320 --> 21:13.880]  and gentlemen pun intended with six bullets in the chamber and the globalists
[21:13.880 --> 21:18.560]  are so arrogant and so full of bravada and hutzpah that they are rolling that
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.880]  cylinder and then put another head and pull the trigger and our head as well
[21:22.880 --> 21:30.600]  and I am sick of it I'm sick of them rolling that cylinder put one bullet in
[21:30.600 --> 21:37.920]  shutting it down playing Russian roulette with our lives and let me tell
[21:37.920 --> 21:41.200]  you I've studied the psychology the Russians I know the CIA has the
[21:41.200 --> 21:44.480]  anthropologists have the sociologists the rest of them you had one of the
[21:44.480 --> 21:49.520]  former deputy heads of the CIA come out yesterday Kit Daniels wrote about it and
[21:49.520 --> 21:54.640]  info wars calm and say it's time for us to kill Putin or it's time for the KGB
[21:54.640 --> 22:01.080]  elite the FSB to kill him or we are going to come after you and they're
[22:01.080 --> 22:04.800]  taking all those rich KGB guys bank accounts they're messing with them
[22:04.800 --> 22:08.720]  they're doing dirty tricks that they've got black ops in Russia messing with
[22:08.720 --> 22:14.720]  their families trying to get the Russians to start a war and it is because
[22:14.720 --> 22:18.200]  the New World Order has advanced weapons and things it won't matter let's say
[22:18.200 --> 22:27.040]  they shoot down 98% of the nuclear missiles Russia's got 10,000 Topol M's
[22:27.040 --> 22:31.960]  railway fired medium-long range submarine launch cruise missiles wet way
[22:31.960 --> 22:47.360]  more than 10,000 what is 1% of 10,000 100 100 missiles making in the average
[22:47.360 --> 22:57.520]  missile let's say has 10 devices in it 10 nerves five of them are decoys so
[22:57.520 --> 23:01.880]  what's five five of them are decoys five are warheads that's a low number some
[23:01.880 --> 23:07.400]  might have 20 packages 10 or warheads or sometimes an entire package of the
[23:07.400 --> 23:15.680]  warheads you got cruise missiles that come in and fire other cruise missiles
[23:15.680 --> 23:20.240]  off of them to basically get the targeting systems off so that the dummy
[23:20.240 --> 23:24.600]  cruise missiles a bigger signature is get shot down I mean is this really what
[23:24.600 --> 23:32.160]  we want probably the subconsciously we want to join the 54 million aborted
[23:32.160 --> 23:36.720]  babies don't we subconsciously we know we're a wicked nation subconsciously we
[23:36.720 --> 23:42.080]  know we're bad subconsciously and so we're kind of rooting for nuclear war
[23:42.080 --> 23:45.240]  and the end of civilization
[23:45.240 --> 23:54.160]  see we have ancestral memories of struggle and of things being almost
[23:54.160 --> 24:00.400]  unsurvivable and in that we find our greatest greatest moments
[24:00.400 --> 24:06.000]  but see humans have a will to go into crisis it's almost an ancient form of
[24:06.000 --> 24:11.000]  entertainment to have to have war or crisis it's a bunch of drama but you
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.720]  can't do that with airborne Ebola you can't do that with airborne mousepox you
[24:15.720 --> 24:27.680]  can't do that with hydrogen bombs and x-ray lasers and super neutron based
[24:27.680 --> 24:34.640]  antimatter reactions oh that's a highly classified weapons program you just
[24:34.640 --> 24:41.060]  heard about right there Air Force slipped up and gave a briefing on it San
[24:41.060 --> 24:45.240]  Francisco Chronicle 10 years ago look it up and I brought that up to nuclear
[24:45.240 --> 24:49.960]  engineers I know worked in the Pentagon they would turn white and I would bring
[24:49.960 --> 24:53.960]  up the antimatter bombs they've got weapons that will destroy the whole
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.040]  planet just like that in fact they can't even test them obviously they don't know
[24:59.040 --> 25:04.120]  how much they would you seen Star Trek one of the last episodes you know the
[25:04.120 --> 25:07.640]  new Star Trek movies I think they're better than the old ones where they go
[25:07.640 --> 25:11.920]  and drop that dark matter into the center of Spock's planet and implodes
[25:11.920 --> 25:17.080]  how about the whole solar system doing that how about black hole weapons they
[25:17.080 --> 25:24.240]  invented the equations for atomic weapons Max Planck did in 1900 there is
[25:24.240 --> 25:29.120]  Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons program was counted publicly then came
[25:29.120 --> 25:34.320]  official gag order San Francisco Chronicle 2004 I said 10 years ago boom
[25:34.320 --> 25:40.680]  photographic memory but only photographic back to a certain point it's
[25:40.680 --> 25:44.480]  not been photographic the last few years near photographic if I'm focused have
[25:44.480 --> 25:47.600]  the right nutrients but I'm 40 not supposed to have a photographic memory
[25:47.600 --> 25:52.760]  after really 30 starts degrading just saying I'm not making this stuff up
[25:52.760 --> 25:55.800]  people hear me throwing facts numbers statistics but how does this guy know all
[25:55.800 --> 25:59.720]  the stuff yes I do of course I know when they publish a thing about any matter

[36:12.360 --> 36:17.280]  course we follow the developments that are happening around the world and some
[36:17.280 --> 36:24.200]  of the events are linked to Ukraine you met with President Poroshenko in Minsk
[36:24.200 --> 36:32.080]  and Mr. Lavrov also told us about sending another humanitarian convoy
[36:32.080 --> 36:39.320]  and also the militia announced that they will continue their military
[36:39.320 --> 36:47.560]  operation you also asked the militia to provide a humanitarian corridor to avoid
[36:47.560 --> 36:55.720]  bloodshed. There were also media reports about possible tougher sanctions. Also
[36:55.720 --> 37:02.960]  Russian servicemen were reportedly detained on the territory of Ukraine
[37:02.960 --> 37:07.840]  could you give us your take on the situation and what are the future
[37:07.840 --> 37:17.320]  developments in your view thank you. So let's start with our servicemen I made
[37:17.320 --> 37:23.120]  a statement about that you know Ukrainian servicemen also found themselves on
[37:23.120 --> 37:29.760]  the Russian territory and in larger numbers once we had 450 servicemen
[37:29.760 --> 37:35.280]  then we had another 60 and another 16 many of them with arms and some of them
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.880]  they went to Russia and just said you know we were lost but what we saw was
[37:41.880 --> 37:49.920]  that they were with armored vehicles well I do believe that they got lost we
[37:49.920 --> 37:58.400]  don't have clear demarcation in some of the areas so I think it's a purely
[37:58.400 --> 38:04.600]  technical issue we discussed that with the president of Ukraine Mr. Poroshenko
[38:04.600 --> 38:09.200]  and he assured me that the Russian soldiers will be handed over to Russia
[38:09.200 --> 38:16.480]  just like Russia handed over and hands over assessment from Ukraine. This is a
[38:16.480 --> 38:20.520]  two and a half hour video that's why it was just released in last 30 minutes or
[38:20.520 --> 38:25.000]  so that's why no major media yet has the specific quotes we have the text
[38:25.000 --> 38:30.600]  released by RT we've got our guys reviewing it right now we will go
[38:30.600 --> 38:35.640]  through this and get to the part where he talks about don't mess with Russia and
[38:35.640 --> 38:41.600]  will retaliate and the rest of it but the full transcript is on infowars.com
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.840]  and the video is posted there as well but we're gonna post it separately with
[38:46.840 --> 38:54.960]  the word video in the headline so folks can can see that if they want but no
[38:54.960 --> 38:58.040]  one's perfect in this whole thing Russia has done a lot of bad things to
[38:58.040 --> 39:03.720]  Ukraine but part of Ukraine has been part of Russia basically forever the
[39:03.720 --> 39:07.320]  western Ukrainians and a lot of bad stuff teaching Ukrainians we're not in
[39:07.320 --> 39:12.920]  the middle as Americans in their tribal sectarian warfare the EU is in there
[39:12.920 --> 39:22.840]  manipulating things to consolidate power and control that's what's happening and
[39:22.840 --> 39:26.120]  they want to suck that country dry that's why they ethnically want to bring
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.280]  in groups and then hype them up racially in the United States not to
[39:30.280 --> 39:34.720]  assimilate but to be their own group attached the Democratic Party that's
[39:34.720 --> 39:38.480]  race-based politics the Democrats did that and ran the country for over a
[39:38.480 --> 39:43.000]  hundred years with the Klan when Christian Republicans wouldn't go along with it
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.680]  with Martin Luther King and others that were Republicans and I'm not saying
[39:46.680 --> 39:49.560]  Republicans are perfect they're part of the corrupt political class the
[39:49.560 --> 39:53.680]  Democrats switched to racial politics with minorities and now they've brought
[39:53.680 --> 39:58.000]  in a majority of minorities if there was one white person huddling in a corner
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.080]  about to be shot in the head that'd be a majority so this is how the political
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.600]  correctness works race-based politics but they've gotten rid of the
[40:06.600 --> 40:13.720]  populations immune system to this form of manipulation to where we just accept
[40:13.720 --> 40:18.120]  anything except Obamacare a giant criminal operation that big corporations
[40:18.120 --> 40:22.720]  are exempt from that's illegal and that raises taxes on poor people or you're
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.520]  against black people because Obama's black and he couldn't do anything wrong
[40:27.520 --> 40:37.520]  this is how the system operates and you've got incredible war propaganda
[40:37.520 --> 40:45.120]  going on right now here's the headline in the London Telegraph from 2008 a few
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.600]  days after 888 when Georgia launched an attack on Russian-held areas of
[40:49.600 --> 40:55.960]  Caucasian South Ossetia that have been Russian enclaves forever Russia threatens
[40:55.960 --> 40:59.720]  nuclear attack on Poland over US missile shield Russia threatened a nuclear
[40:59.720 --> 41:05.120]  strike against Poland after landmark deal to cite American global anti-missile
[41:05.120 --> 41:08.320]  shields in its country because what they really are and what the Pentagon admits
[41:08.320 --> 41:12.720]  they are is a system to where you can launch a nuclear attack on Russia they
[41:12.720 --> 41:18.800]  try to launch a response and the missiles shoot that down and they talk to us
[41:18.800 --> 41:22.520]  like children and go no it's to shoot down missiles of Russia shoots first of
[41:22.520 --> 41:27.800]  course but it's an escalation because you can hit Russia and then they can't
[41:27.800 --> 41:33.680]  respond back so it's a major act of war to bring anti-missile systems up to
[41:33.680 --> 41:40.760]  somebody's border imagine of Russians in Canada and Mexico or stationing these
[41:40.760 --> 41:48.920]  the United States will hit the targets we have found the clip of Putin talking
[41:48.920 --> 41:53.760]  about the response to the situation in Ukraine so here it is from the two and
[41:53.760 --> 41:58.840]  a half hour meeting we're gonna play this clip then we're gonna get this clip
[41:58.840 --> 42:04.200]  and excise it out for folks and put it up on info wars.com but here it is
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.520]  Vladimir Putin telling NATO the West George Soros and the rest of them love
[42:09.520 --> 42:14.320]  them or hating they've got the nuclear weapons do not push us don't mess with
[42:14.320 --> 42:22.880]  Russia here is the clip. Historical memory is the very important component of our
[42:22.880 --> 42:30.520]  culture. Our life's a day and of course we should also consider this
[42:30.520 --> 42:36.760]  future based on our historical experience and our historical memory so I can
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.640]  tell you destroy the way that Russia is far from being involved in large-scale
[42:41.640 --> 42:47.000]  conflicts we don't want that and we're not going to do that of course we should
[42:47.000 --> 42:54.720]  always be ready to repel any aggression any attack on Russia regardless of the
[42:54.720 --> 43:00.720]  situation our partners nations are in they should always realize that they
[43:00.720 --> 43:06.400]  would be better off not messing with us talking about the possible military
[43:06.400 --> 43:12.000]  conflict but thankfully I don't think anybody seriously considers the
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.120]  possibility of starting a military conflict with Russia I would like to
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.840]  remind you that Russia is one of the biggest nuclear powers they're not just
[43:21.840 --> 43:27.600]  words this is real and we actually strengthen our nuclear forces they are
[43:27.600 --> 43:34.680]  more compact now but they're also more efficient they're more modern they have
[43:34.680 --> 43:42.440]  modern weaponry and we continue to boost their potential and we are going to do
[43:42.440 --> 43:48.280]  this in the future as well this is not to threaten anybody it's just for us to
[43:48.280 --> 43:56.640]  feel protected and be able to implement our economic and social plans as far as
[43:56.640 --> 44:06.080]  cycles are concerned yes I think that global development is a cyclical primarily
[44:06.080 --> 44:21.720]  I think because the economy develops cycles and this has been proven we have
[44:21.720 --> 44:28.440]  an economist present here there it is in context there's the audio there's the
[44:28.440 --> 44:32.960]  video we'll get that clip we'll have it up on info wars.com upon YouTube the
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.880]  next 30 minutes or so we have the full two plus hours up but we're gonna have
[44:36.880 --> 44:43.120]  that for everybody up updated to info wars.com we're going to get that
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.520]  posted on one of our YouTube channels right now for everybody else as well
[44:47.520 --> 44:53.640]  if you're a radio listener. We do have Ray McGovern former top CIA
[44:53.640 --> 44:57.600]  briefer to Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush who was on with us
[44:57.600 --> 45:06.640]  on August 15th two weeks ago warning a little less than two weeks ago that this
[45:06.640 --> 45:11.600]  could lead to nuclear war and that it's a very real threat every major analyst I
[45:11.600 --> 45:18.200]  talked to people formerly in defense intelligence CIA professors on and off
[45:18.200 --> 45:24.240]  air and all the trade publications I read military publications Pentagon
[45:24.240 --> 45:35.160]  statements I mean this is a real push up into the border of Russia and if NATO
[45:35.160 --> 45:39.280]  troops start engaging Russian troops who feel like they're in their interest
[45:39.280 --> 45:43.920]  with their military bases their pipelines when they're trying to cut Russia off
[45:43.920 --> 45:49.120]  from Europe which will hurt Europe big time as well this isn't America where
[45:49.120 --> 45:53.960]  Obama just gets to shut down a third of our power plants and double on average
[45:53.960 --> 45:57.400]  our electricity prices in seven years this isn't America where they get to
[45:57.400 --> 46:00.880]  pass the health care law that raises seven taxes on poor people with death
[46:00.880 --> 46:07.760]  panels and death panels at the VA this is Russia we're talking about that has its
[46:07.760 --> 46:13.760]  own set of problems but their public is more informed on average you look at the
[46:13.760 --> 46:17.160]  studies on that they know geographically what's going on they understand
[46:17.160 --> 46:22.600]  that they have the memory of 20 million Russians dying in World War two the
[46:22.600 --> 46:27.680]  Germans have it as well 20 million Germans died only five six million of
[46:27.680 --> 46:33.040]  those were were troops show governments do this they make decisions they do
[46:33.040 --> 46:37.440]  things tens of millions died overall from war and famine the Napoleonic Wars
[46:37.440 --> 46:42.240]  all three rounds and people never think it's gonna happen until it happens and
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.200]  this time there's nuclear weapons I believe the Bible but I don't believe
[46:46.200 --> 46:49.600]  the establishment interpretations of where we all get raptured out of this
[46:49.600 --> 46:53.320]  no it says the beast wages war on the saints and overcomes them then there's
[46:53.320 --> 46:56.880]  a big revival people wake up and start repenting there's awakening around the
[46:56.880 --> 47:04.600]  world one-third of the earth's population is killed large portions of the
[47:04.600 --> 47:09.080]  earth's surface are black that's what the Bible says columns of flame bigger
[47:09.080 --> 47:16.400]  than mountains giant machines that look like insects flying around dropping
[47:16.400 --> 47:22.040]  fire on people this is what John on the Isle of Patmos saw and hey even if you
[47:22.040 --> 47:25.720]  don't believe in God or the collective consciousness or anything that matter
[47:25.720 --> 47:28.760]  boy a lot of that's coming true and it didn't want these preachers tell you
[47:28.760 --> 47:32.120]  who think they're big mega churches protect them from nuclear weapons while
[47:32.120 --> 47:38.480]  their little CIA FBI auxiliary officers riding dossiers you know up late at night
[47:38.480 --> 47:42.480]  on the on their churchgoers and you know which family they're gonna break up and
[47:42.480 --> 47:45.720]  how they're gonna get people's money and you know I mean I mean these are these
[47:45.720 --> 47:51.560]  are savage operations but just a bunch of gullible Americans just believing
[47:51.560 --> 47:56.160]  anything oh we got a great country we're the greatest in the world we're perfect
[47:56.160 --> 48:02.360]  we can do no wrong blah blah blah we are hijacked just like France was by the
[48:02.360 --> 48:06.760]  Nazis our government is a bunch of collaborators with offshore banks who
[48:06.760 --> 48:12.400]  literally are running us into the ground Russia goes you want to cut our
[48:12.400 --> 48:16.320]  pipelines off with our contracts where we sell the cheapest gas in the world
[48:16.320 --> 48:23.120]  to Europe you want to be able to drive up prices on people worldwide no we're
[48:23.120 --> 48:26.960]  gonna be competitive and the globalists and the Rothschilds and the Dutch
[48:26.960 --> 48:30.560]  royalty and the British royalty and all the rest of them that are driving this
[48:30.560 --> 48:34.600]  they went we're coming in to Eastern Ukraine we're taking over your oil
[48:34.600 --> 48:37.840]  fields and your gas fields that you developed and you got leases on and
[48:37.840 --> 48:41.240]  your pipelines that come out of Russia and those rich gas fields over the
[48:41.240 --> 48:45.720]  border and we're gonna give it to Joe Biden's son we're gonna give some of the
[48:45.720 --> 48:49.080]  stock to the British Royal family some of the Dutch we're gonna give Obama some
[48:49.080 --> 48:53.720]  Joe Biden's son you get two billion dollars out two billion dollars worth
[48:53.720 --> 48:58.840]  how's that sound Biden comes out goes I'm proud my son is a good business man
[48:58.840 --> 49:04.600]  yeah the Russians are what literally watching Joe Biden's son take over their
[49:04.600 --> 49:12.160]  their gas so they've sent in special forces to protect it and they're getting
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.960]  killed right now fighting mercenaries on the CIA and there's US troops getting
[49:16.960 --> 49:20.680]  killed over there right now you better believe it so Putin doesn't replace the
[49:20.680 --> 49:25.720]  game of we've got a few soldiers over there and notice all the kids laugh they
[49:25.720 --> 49:33.480]  all understand that Americans get told there's no two plus two equals five no
[49:33.480 --> 49:37.680]  they know it equals four so we have a few soldiers someone got picked up but
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.720]  they're gonna be released everybody's like playing along with because they're
[49:42.720 --> 49:48.480]  giving us our own response oh there's no CIA or mercenaries attacking eastern
[49:48.480 --> 49:55.480]  Ukraine oh no and Putin's like oh and there's none of our troops either yes and
[49:55.480 --> 49:59.320]  he goes and this is not a threat but we have nuclear weapons that was this is a
[49:59.320 --> 50:03.920]  threat and you watch within hours his generals will come out and threaten to
[50:03.920 --> 50:11.040]  nuke Europe in the United States and remember who runs things we got
[50:11.040 --> 50:14.800]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan others with people like John Corzine who would make
[50:14.800 --> 50:21.400]  40 to 1 bets with private bank accounts he'd bought a subsidiary bank and then
[50:21.400 --> 50:25.160]  most people didn't get their money back for two plus years and he didn't get in
[50:25.160 --> 50:29.440]  trouble that's how reckless and great let me tell you the elite are just like

[54:26.280 --> 54:30.520]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:30.520 --> 54:38.000]  The toll-free number to join us here today is 800-259-9231-8259-9231.
[54:38.000 --> 54:44.680]  Now, our loving government run by foreign banks has been funding Al Qaeda and changing
[54:44.680 --> 54:48.520]  their name to confuse the public and then having fake airstrikes on them while they
[54:48.520 --> 54:50.440]  turn the Middle East over to them.
[54:50.440 --> 54:54.680]  And while they overthrow all our previous allies, because they're not America haters,
[54:54.680 --> 54:59.360]  while the destabilization goes on in Africa as well, our border is completely being dissolved.
[54:59.360 --> 55:02.920]  Obama, it's in the Associated Press, is shut by the end of the month.
[55:02.920 --> 55:04.120]  He said he'd do it by the end of August.
[55:04.120 --> 55:10.320]  I guess that means the next two days to sign an executive order bypassing Congress.
[55:10.320 --> 55:12.960]  You may have heard that two days ago on the carbon tax.
[55:12.960 --> 55:16.760]  I'm recovering that sum on the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[55:16.760 --> 55:19.080]  Just, hey, I'm king.
[55:19.080 --> 55:20.080]  I'm just going to do it.
[55:20.080 --> 55:25.400]  But now he's doing government by not even executive order, but just saying, I told the
[55:25.400 --> 55:26.400]  department head.
[55:26.400 --> 55:29.200]  So there's not even a memo or a piece of paper.
[55:29.200 --> 55:33.200]  There's a piece of paper when a cop gives you a ticket, where it was, where the street
[55:33.200 --> 55:38.380]  was, where the court, the law, the fine.
[55:38.380 --> 55:43.120]  But when you shut down the power plants and get ready to put taxes on every mile you drive
[55:43.120 --> 55:48.040]  with satellite tracker boxes in all the cars lined up beforehand, getting you ready for
[55:48.040 --> 55:49.040]  it.
[55:49.040 --> 55:56.160]  Oh, when that's going on, the feds have come out.
[55:56.160 --> 56:02.120]  After this article two days ago from CNS News, feds move to require car-to-car safety communication,
[56:02.120 --> 56:05.560]  which will tax you by the mile.
[56:05.560 --> 56:11.280]  Feds deny vehicle-to-vehicle communications tech will be used to spy on drivers.
[56:11.280 --> 56:16.920]  Basic safety message to broadcast GPS signal, totally ridiculous, folks.
[56:16.920 --> 56:17.920]  That's right.
[56:17.920 --> 56:19.480]  Today's not spying on you.
[56:19.480 --> 56:27.000]  And if you've got a business, you didn't build it, and on and on and on.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.160]  This is just beyond insane.
[56:29.160 --> 56:34.240]  And the whole Republican leadership is working with the crazies that run Wall Street.
[56:34.240 --> 56:38.480]  That doesn't mean your average brokerage house, your average stock, the big megabanks, the
[56:38.480 --> 56:41.760]  high-frequency traders, the people that have rigged the market.
[56:41.760 --> 56:43.880]  How long did I tell you it was rigged with experts?
[56:43.880 --> 56:49.720]  And then Rolling Stone last year, or two years ago, the whole game's rigged.
[56:49.720 --> 56:52.840]  The stock market, the interest rates, everything.
[56:52.840 --> 56:58.360]  The top echelon is basically exempt, has all the info, runs the markets.
[56:58.360 --> 57:04.240]  What are you going to tell us next, Alex, that Las Vegas casinos are rigged in favor
[57:04.240 --> 57:05.240]  of the house?
[57:05.240 --> 57:12.280]  Next, you're going to tell me H2O stands for dihydrogen monoxide.
[57:12.280 --> 57:16.040]  That's water.
[57:16.040 --> 57:18.560]  You know, I've gone on the streets of Austin and nine out of ten people.
[57:18.560 --> 57:23.680]  It was actually more than, we talked like 20 people, until one of them knew that we
[57:23.680 --> 57:30.240]  were saying, we want to ban a hydrogen monoxide, it's in everything, it's, it causes excess
[57:30.240 --> 57:32.120]  urination, we want to ban it.
[57:32.120 --> 57:33.120]  And the people would sign.
[57:33.120 --> 57:34.120]  They'd go, oh, I'm an engineer.
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.160]  Yeah, I agree.
[57:36.160 --> 57:41.320]  Start hitting on Lee and McAdoo, one guy in the video was like, yeah, I went to Princeton
[57:41.320 --> 57:42.320]  or something.
[57:42.320 --> 57:43.320]  Yeah, I'm an engineer.
[57:43.320 --> 57:44.320]  How you doing, baby?
[57:44.320 --> 57:45.320]  Yeah.
[57:45.320 --> 57:46.320]  About bad water.
[57:46.320 --> 57:47.320]  Sure.
[57:47.320 --> 57:48.320]  That's why they think we're so dumb.
[57:48.320 --> 57:52.960]  I mean, because nine out of ten Americans will ban water because they don't know the
[57:52.960 --> 57:53.960]  scientific name.
[57:53.960 --> 57:58.240]  Just like they'll ban salt if you give them a scientific name.
[57:58.240 --> 58:00.680]  I'm not even that smart.
[58:00.680 --> 58:02.880]  That's what's frustrating about this is it's crazy.
[58:02.880 --> 58:04.840]  They're trying to start nuclear war with Russia.
[58:04.840 --> 58:09.600]  We're going to break it down with the former top CIA analyst, Ronald Reagan and George Herbert
[58:09.600 --> 58:16.400]  Walker Bush, their favorite morning briefer, Ray McGovern coming up.
[58:16.400 --> 58:19.920]  Don't forget, while we're all still here, it's important to support the independent
[58:19.920 --> 58:21.760]  free media that's under attack.
[58:21.760 --> 58:26.400]  Please go to infowarstore.com for the best prices on high quality water filters, the

[58:39.600 --> 58:40.600]  Tell your friends and family to tune in.
[58:40.600 --> 58:41.600]  I want to be patriotic.
[58:41.600 --> 58:42.600]  I think we need to have nuclear war with Russia.
[58:42.600 --> 58:43.600]  That's a smart move.
[58:43.600 --> 58:44.600]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset, where we are proud of our 100% grown and
[58:44.600 --> 58:57.120]  sown American made jeans.

[59:18.880 --> 59:22.760]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male and then when Super Female came out,
[59:22.760 --> 59:23.760]  else what happened?
[59:23.760 --> 59:28.520]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[59:28.520 --> 59:29.520]  Talk about the effects.
[59:29.520 --> 59:31.280]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[59:31.280 --> 59:33.000]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[59:33.000 --> 59:34.200]  I feel like I look better.
[59:34.200 --> 59:35.200]  I feel better.
[59:35.200 --> 59:36.200]  I feel sexier.
[59:36.200 --> 59:37.200]  I love it.
[59:37.200 --> 59:40.040]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[59:40.040 --> 59:43.000]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.320]  Check it out for yourself.
[59:44.320 --> 59:45.320]  Consult your physician.
[59:45.320 --> 59:47.560]  Visit infowarslife.com today.
[59:47.560 --> 01:00:17.520]  This is life-changing.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:22.720]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.720]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:31.520]  The globalists like to dump stuff down to war on terror or countdown to meltdown.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.600]  Here's the real headline.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:42.800]  Western forces battle Russian forces over control of Russian oil and gas infrastructure.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.920]  That's what's going on.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.160]  And so our media goes, oh, no, there's no forces or NATO, even though they're admittedly
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:56.600]  there fighting with Russians, and the Russians are like, oh, there's no, no, we're not either.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.160]  But if you attack our forces openly or come up and attack Russian forces that are inside
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.920]  Russia, we got nuclear weapons.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:08.400]  That is such a huge escalation to putting nuclear weapons on the table.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.680]  The video is up on infowars.com right now.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.880]  No, nuclear Putin says don't mess with Russia.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.560]  We have the two hour 30 minute video up there of his full meet and greet and talking to
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.520]  college students and youth groups.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.680]  But before we, I mean, I mean, that's important.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.680]  You guys found the time code, we should probably go note in our article where the time code
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.120]  is so folks can skip ahead to that.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:39.800]  And then we're going to excise out the very video for other news sites and people that
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:45.480]  probably want it and have that up on infowars.com the next 20, 30 minutes at Buckley and they're
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.680]  working on it right now doing a great job.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.880]  Man, let's go to one call before Ray McGovern comes on and at the bottom of the hour, I
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.800]  will go to Chris, Will, Chris, John and others.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.760]  Let's go to Greg in Arizona in this short segment.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:00.760]  What's your take on this?
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:06.040]  I mean, I guess I'm supposed to be patriotic and do what the occupied government says and
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:11.440]  support stealing the Russian oil and gas infrastructure that they built in eastern Ukraine that they
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:18.120]  have contracts on and I should support the ethnic cleansing of the Russian majority there
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.760]  and I should support nuclear war.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.840]  So I want to say I do and I support two plus two equals five and I didn't build info wars
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.000]  like Obama said.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  I did nothing.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.360]  I didn't get up this morning.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.400]  I didn't, I just didn't do anything.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.240]  So just fairness doctrine and radios back now, so I want to be fair a little bit there.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.880]  Sorry, go ahead, Greg.
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.880]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.760]  I'm from Lake Havasu City, Arizona and I'm a first time caller.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:50.040]  I've been listening to your show for, oh, geez, over a year.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.040]  I've been calling in this first time I actually got through.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.120]  I think it's a disgrace what we're doing over there and what's going on and I think
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.000]  it's all funded by the Builderbergs and all these people.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Oh, it definitely is.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.440]  Builderberg has been saying they're a takedown Russia and it's not that Russia's great.
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:07.920]  It's just that they're not starting anything.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.680]  It's like, I don't even like my neighbor.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.320]  I can't go over and punch him in the nose or take his car and then if he comes out and
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.280]  fights me for it, oh, you're fighting me.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.000]  I just overthrew the Ukrainian government started a war with you.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.480]  I'm moving missiles up your borders.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.280]  How dare you not love me?
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.600]  How dare you?
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.440]  And again, you're saying a disgrace.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.920]  Look at how our so-called governments funding al-Qaeda.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.920]  Go ahead.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.920]  It's ridiculous.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:38.920]  And as far as what to say, the guy that's come over here to ruin our country.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920]  Soros.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920]  You know, Soros.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.920]  The Nazi collaborator.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920]  Yeah.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.440]  How does he get away with staying in our country and doing all this stuff?
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.720]  Well, I mean, he would hunt down Jews that were hiding.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.720]  He knew where they would hide.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.800]  Now they'd hide their money and then he transferred to the Nazis and he got a big nest egg out
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800]  of it.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.760]  I mean, that's just, I mean, look, if you're, if you're a Schwarzenegger and say you love
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.280]  Hitler on video, you get an ADL award.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:09.960]  If you actually helped hunt down Jews en masse, you, you, you get worshiped by the ADLs.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.320]  But if you fight Nazis, you get demonized by them and the ADL attacks me.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:17.520]  MSNBC says I'm deeply racist and shows no proof.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.560]  Two plus two equals five, bro.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.560]  You didn't know that?
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.560]  Yeah.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.560]  He, he, he does live in America, right?
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.560]  He sure does.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:30.480]  So they're always hunting some fake old man, Nazi jail guard, and it never turns out to
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.560]  actually be a Nazi jail guard.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.920]  It's always some Eastern European, you know, who can't prove anything and is like 92 and
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.800]  can't talk and they'll roll out some deaf man and go, he's a Nazi.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.720]  Look, we're hunting them down when they brought 36,000 Nazis to the U.S. to run the universities,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.480]  the government, NASA, everything, everything.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:59.680]  Look, we found a 94-year-old blind guy who had caught us a Nazi, ha, ha, ha, we're right.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.360]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.720]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.720]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:15.320]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.360]  priced and fully legal.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:25.440]  But for how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L, body armor dot com.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.760]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.

[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.000]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  the water.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.040]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:14.040]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.040]  single day?
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.280]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.280]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.320]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.240]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:32.160]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.280]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.560]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:44.560]  The Pro Pure Pro 1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must have for every modern independently

[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.960]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.840]  much get healthy and detoxified.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.640]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.160]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.560]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.400]  Then about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:33.280]  out with rare earth, deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have had
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.440]  have been life changing.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.320]  Everything else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.160]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the

[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:08.880]  Newed hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the Gulf of Tonkin
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:16.240]  have today required me to order the military forces of the United States to take action
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.240]  and reply.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:22.800]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.800]  to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:52.440]  They took the babies out of incubators and left their children to die on the cold floor.
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.680]  Citizens of the USS Liberty are demanding a congressional investigation into what happened
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:02.440]  in acknowledgement that the Israeli Air Force bombed a US intelligence Navy ship.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:06.800]  The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.800]  to defeat Al Qaeda.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.560]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a US helicopter.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.040]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.560]  are US Navy SEALs.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:23.120]  There may be a false flag incident where a ship goes down and you'll be used for the
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.120]  excuse to accelerate the next war.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.080]  If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between,
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.320]  it's that we all hate it.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320]  The bank bailout.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:37.040]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.800]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition today.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.120]  It is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:52.280]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.320]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.480]  I'm here to warn people.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.080]  You keep telling me to shut up.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.440]  This isn't a game.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:07.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.440]  We're now well into the second hour.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.440]  We aired the false flag intro there to point out that the most wars, escalations of wars,
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:20.640]  are launched by stage provocations by the Russians, the Nazis, the U.S. government.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.120]  This is something done since the times of the Romans.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.040]  Ray McGovern has graciously come on on short notice because of the global crisis.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.040]  I could not think of a better guess to have on concerning this.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.680]  Just two weeks ago, we played the clip yesterday, he broke down how this could lead to nuclear
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680]  war.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.400]  I wanted to be able to flesh that out a little bit better today because we were up against
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.560]  a time constraint and he had to go.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.000]  So I want to be able to get into more detail.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.440]  He's a native of New York, Washington.
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.880]  Is the early 60s as an Army Infantry Intelligence Officer.
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.280]  He served as a CIA analyst for the administration of John F. Kennedy to that of George H.W.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.280]  Bush.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.760]  Ray briefed one-on-one President Ronald Reagan, most senior national security advisor from
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.160]  81 to 85 was one of their favorite morning briefers.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.840]  Point is he knows what he's talking about in a wide spectrum.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.120]  Putin, Russian, German, and Spanish, Ray holds an MA in Russian from Fordham University
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.040]  and Certificate of Theological Studies from Georgetown.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.840]  He's also a graduate of Harvard Business School, Advanced Management Program.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:24.160]  He holds a certificate in Theology Studies from Georgetown University, RayMcGovern.com.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.040]  And the reason he's here today is, we played the clip last hour, we're going to play it
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:33.600]  coming up in a few minutes, Putin has come out and said, listen, if you attack any of
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.360]  our forces or basically keep moving more forces in.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.720]  We are going to respond and defend ourselves.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.040]  We are a nuclear power, but that's not a threat.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.840]  Well, obviously it is a threat.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:51.120]  This is the doctrine they've had since 888 in 2008 when Western forces attacked a city
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:59.320]  in South Ossetia and Nipkazia as a pretext to try to demonize Russia.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.960]  And again, I've never been to Russia, I'm not defending Russia, I've studied it.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.520]  They're not in an aggressive posture.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.320]  The West is and it's very dangerous.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.000]  Just like when they wanted to take over the airport in Pristina and the Russians said,
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.120]  no, we'll have a war with you.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:19.760]  And it was only the head of NATO backing down that stopped that from going possibly nuclear.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:24.080]  Here's the headline, Russia threatens nuclear attack on Poland over US Missile Shield.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:31.600]  That was on August 15th, a few days after the situation began to settle down in Georgia.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.080]  Here's the headline of the New York Times.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.960]  US General was overruled in Kosovo.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:40.240]  General Jackson rejected the order from a superior by saying, no, I'm not going to do
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.240]  that.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.600]  It's not worth starting World War III.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:48.760]  The last time NATO, who's spoiling for a fight with the Russians, tried to order attacks
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:53.720]  on Russians at their air base that they'd been since World War II.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.440]  So this is a replay of this.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:02.000]  This is beyond Cuban Missile Crisis in my layman view, but I researched this deeply.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.760]  This is really getting out of control.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.880]  There's obviously the CIA director went there.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:13.120]  They've got special ops from the people that I've talked to and mercenaries advising.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.160]  There's all sorts of stuff going on.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.120]  The Russians have been shooting down Ukrainian drones.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.560]  There have been Russian columns getting destroyed.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.760]  And Putin basically said, some of our troops have been captured.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.920]  They'll be returned.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.080]  And then the kids all laughed when he gave the speech.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.880]  He was there talking to a youth group.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.760]  So I mean, I take from that, let's just be honest, there are Russian forces there protecting
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:40.160]  their interests, their gas fields that they put in their pipelines, their military bases,
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.360]  their Black Sea base.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.040]  Now that's my little briefing because a lot of stations just joined us.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:51.360]  We have a lot of new stations in LA and just joined us this week.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.960]  I need to plug that new station in Oklahoma City and so many others.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.440]  The broadcast is exploding.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.600]  I wanted to give folks some background here.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:03.760]  Ray, am I correct in my basic gestalt I tried to paint there?
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.600]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.080]  Is this getting as big or bigger in the Cuban Missile Crisis?
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.080]  Ray McGovern.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:17.880]  Well, it is, Alex, in the sense that never before have the US and Russia been at such
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.880]  loggerheads.
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.920]  There's a little difference here.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:29.160]  The missiles that we now know were ready to fire in Cuba.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:34.080]  We didn't know it at the time or a direct threat to our security.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.320]  There's no way, Alex, there's no way anyone invents me.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.600]  That was going on in the Ukraine.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.200]  There's a direct threat to our security.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:51.400]  It is, however, a direct threat to what the Russians believe to be their security.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:57.080]  They have national interests, their strategic interests, they're not going to let a NATO
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:03.200]  member be in place right under their soft underbelly.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.980]  So it is worse because Kennedy did the right thing in the Cuban Missile Crisis and had
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:08.980]  detente.
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.480]  They got the missiles out.
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:13.040]  It turned out to be a victory for our security.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.760]  This time it's literally the EU, Wall Street, other interests want to gobble up Ukraine
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:23.200]  and they're treating Russia like it's Iraq.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.560]  That's right, Alex.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:33.440]  It's really something to behold for somebody who spent his first 35 professional years
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:39.040]  focusing in on the evil empire, the Soviet Union.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:47.040]  It was even enough and it's very, very difficult for this old fellow to turn his mind around
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:56.560]  and stop just assuming that the US and NATO are telling the truth and kind of having to
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:03.360]  assume from what I know and what I am observing that it's just the opposite, but in this case
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:10.080]  for the most part, with some exaggerations, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.760]  and Putin himself are mostly telling the truth.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:20.960]  And the big truth they're telling is, look, we told you years ago, we told you in February
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:25.440]  2008, Nets means Nets.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:32.760]  If you have any designs to bring Ukraine into NATO, forget about it, as they would say in
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:33.760]  the Bronx.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.760]  Forget about it.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.520]  Now what happened?
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:45.400]  That was on the 1st of February, 2008, Sergey Lavrov, who is Foreign Minister Ben as well,
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.280]  called our ambassador in.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:52.080]  Bill Burns, he's now Deputy Secretary of State, and he said, look, there are rumors going
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:58.760]  around that you all are going to try to incorporate Ukraine and Georgia into NATO.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:04.160]  We just want to make sure you understand, this will be a direct threat to our security
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.360]  and we say Nets, and Nets means Nets.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:13.200]  Now Bill Burns reported that back to Washington in the top secret cable, and how do we know
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.200]  about that?
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:20.040]  Well, give credit where it's due, WikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.040]  It's in the cable.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.040]  I have the cable.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:28.280]  It reads, just as I said, Bill Burns saying, look, you ought to be aware that I was called
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:33.240]  on the carpet here, the Russians feel very strongly about this, they predict that the
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:40.080]  country will fall apart if hostilities start by virtue of trying to get them into NATO.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.440]  And so I'm just reporting this to you so that you'll know.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.840]  Now that was the 1st of February, six years ago, 2008.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.680]  So what happened?
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:56.080]  What happened was this, on the 3rd of April, a NATO summit of the kind that we'll just
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.480]  convene in Wales on the 4th and 5th of September next week.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:07.920]  The NATO summit in Bucharest decided, and I quote from their declaration, Ukraine and
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.800]  Georgia will become members of NATO, period, end quote.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:22.320]  Now what happened after that was this crazy fellow in Georgia, Sakashvili, thought that
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.760]  what the Neocons would tell him about having his back, right, that they'd have his back.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:33.520]  And so he started to give the Russians a bloody nose just to the north of the Georgian border.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.040]  And now the Russians came back and gave him a very, very bloody nose, and the whole thing
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:45.160]  collapsed because the U.S. would never intervene in so far away a place with no real relevance
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.160]  to the U.S.
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.560]  And Ray, just to interject, again, former top CIA analyst, Ronald Reagan, and George Herbert
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:57.280]  Walker Bush joins us, a 35, 40-year veteran at the highest levels of global intelligence.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.400]  Writing at that day was seeing and announcing that Russia had just attacked Georgia for
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:05.320]  no reason, and reading the fine print that they had attacked Russian military bases in
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.280]  South Ossetia and Abkhazia and murdered them en masse.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:15.280]  It shows the sheer insanity that our media went with that and said, yeah, let's send
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:22.800]  in NATO till the Russians threatened nuclear attacks on NATO bases, and then they chained
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:29.200]  me backed off, and it turned out from the intel I had, correct me if I'm wrong, that
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:34.160]  the Georgian president had been basically, like Saddam was encouraged to go into Kuwait,
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.120]  quietly told, yeah, go ahead and do this, we've got your back.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.760]  What were they thinking there out of the blue for just attack Russian military bases?
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.920]  Thank God it didn't escalate more.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.280]  And then when I said, I'm glad the Russians are showing restraint pulling out at Georgia,
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:55.840]  they had all the neocons come out and claim I'm a Russian agent, when literally both
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.480]  sides of my family came over on the Mayflower, I mean that is how sick this has gotten, I'm
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.720]  a traitor, you're a traitor, you know they said that about you, because we don't want
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:09.360]  nuclear war, Ray, what is wrong with the ruling elite, JFK was no angel, but he would never
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:13.400]  act like this, Reagan didn't do stuff like this, George Herbert Walker Bush didn't do
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.760]  stuff like this, what is wrong with them?
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:24.520]  Well, President Obama doesn't have any real strategy here, he's kind of looking around
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:29.240]  and seeing which way the wind is going, I say that facetiously, but that's pretty much
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:34.400]  what he said yesterday, when he was asked about policy towards Syria, Iraq and that
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:40.880]  kind of thing, he's a very weak leader, let's face it, and what's happened here is that
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:47.720]  the Victoria Newlands who worked for Dick Cheney for most of her career and now as Assistant
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:55.840]  Secretary of State for European Affairs, she and John Kerry are running the policy toward
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:04.440]  these areas, now they were the ones that encouraged the coup d'etat in Kiev on the 22nd of February,
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:09.640]  you don't have to believe me, none of your viewers have to believe me, just listen to
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.560]  the intercepted conversation, here's Victoria Newland speaking enclare, not even encrypted
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:22.480]  to the US ambassador there in Kiev, and she's saying, you know, Yats is our guy, the other
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:27.360]  fellows, they can stay in the wings here, but Yats is going to be the next prime minister,
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.680]  he knows, he's been head of the central bank, he knows what austerity measures are going
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:39.320]  to be needed by the IMF, so he's our guy, now that was at the end of January, Alex,
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:47.800]  in the January of this year, on the 22nd of February, there's a coup, and guess who
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:51.760]  becomes the prime minister, Yats.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.960]  And then Obama calls him elected when he was not elected.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:02.960]  Yikes, it's Yats, now just to borrow a phrase from the Declaration of Independence, a decent
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:10.280]  respect for the opinions of mankind, having that intercepted conversation between Newland
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:16.920]  and Payet on YouTube, showing that Yats was our guy, I mean, you would think that that
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:22.520]  would maybe disqualify Yats from becoming the prime minister of Ukraine, no, no, no,
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.440]  the Hutzpah is such, but it was thought to be a threat.
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:32.560]  Well, that's what scares me, they don't even use encrypted telephones, they act so arrogant,
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:37.000]  and I've studied history as I know you have, sir, these are the times in history where
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.760]  you get arrogant elites, this is how we end to the last interview, and I want to get into
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:45.400]  this with you now, where they just start making wrong moves, they think they're invincible,
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.960]  they've never been in combat, and that's one big problem, having all these people in the
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:53.760]  government that have never been in combat like you and others, they just think they're
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:59.400]  invincible, they think they're bulletproof, like 14-year-old boys, and anybody who studied
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:04.280]  history can see the incredible danger, the stance the Russians are getting in, they look
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:09.840]  completely freaked out, but have a lot of resolve, and I'm not even lionizing them, it's just
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:16.520]  a fact they're under attack overall, you broke down what it means to have the anti-missile
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:21.840]  systems in the Black Sea, and obviously have been snuck into Ukraine and Poland on record,
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.080]  that's come out, what is going to happen when you talk about launch on warning, explain
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:31.760]  to people how this works, and then spend some time getting into where you think this is
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.840]  going, is there some form of sanity that can abound, what are other intelligence analysts
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.960]  saying, both former and current, I know I talked to some of them, they're completely
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:46.160]  freaked out, what are your colleagues that are still in government saying?
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:53.480]  Well, the basic problem is we have a bunch of sophomores who, as you point out, don't
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:59.560]  know what war is like, they've got Obama's ear, of course Obama doesn't know what war
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:07.400]  is like, but save this from war against Syria and a widened war in the Middle East, at precisely
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:13.640]  this time last year was General Dempsey, the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, who does
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:19.320]  know something about war, has his head screwed on right, and went to President Obama and
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:26.120]  said, look, Mr. President, we know that you really favor those young folks in the White
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:32.320]  House and in the UN, especially those tough women who want to protect everybody else in
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:38.880]  the whole world, but frankly, Mr. President, they don't know anything about war.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:43.400]  We in the Joint Chiefs do, for better or for worse.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:48.640]  And my colleagues have persuaded me, I need to see you and to tell you not only to be
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:57.320]  aware of that kind of advice, but that John Kerry would all do respect, would all do respect.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:04.320]  At the State Department, he talks about starting a war with Syria that would be his words,
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.360]  unbelievably short, end quote, war.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:13.680]  Now Mr. President, I hope you know that there's no such animal in the Middle East, there's
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:19.440]  no such unbelievably short war, but again, with all due respect to Kerry, he did drive
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.800]  those boats up the Mekong, but that does not make you a strategic thinker.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:29.160]  Worst of all, Mr. President, he's not telling the truth.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:34.680]  When he said yesterday, on the 30th of August last year, when he said yesterday at the State
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:41.360]  Department, no fewer than 35 times, we know, we know, we know with special eyes, the government
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:46.760]  that fired those chemical weapons on the 21st of August, he doesn't know.
[01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:52.680]  We don't know either, but we think, at least we know, that the sarin used was not the sarin
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:58.680]  from Syrian government stocks, rather it's a homemade sarin and we have the British
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:04.520]  to prove that because they had a sample, they analyzed it, they told me, and so Mr. President,
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:10.840]  it's equally likely, we think even more likely, and so do the CIA analysts think, that it was
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.000]  the rebels, it was the people that you are supporting, it was the people that the Turks
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.280]  are supporting, that staged this chemical attack outside Damascus on August the 21st,
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:28.880]  for the purpose of tripping your little red line that someone persuaded you to draw, and
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.080]  to get the U.S. involved militarily in Syria.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:37.680]  So Mr. President, look, here's a deal, Mr. President.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.880]  When you go into the Rose Garden tomorrow, why don't you blame it on me, says Dempsey?
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:48.760]  Why don't you say, we're ready to go, we have our ships in the Eastern Mediterranean, but
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:54.240]  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff advises me that there's no time sensitivity
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.240]  to this.
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:27:00.640]  We could do it today or tomorrow or next week, we could do it next month, but I'm going to
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.240]  go to Congress now and ask for authorization.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:14.280]  That's precisely what Barack Obama did on the 31st of August, less than 20 hours after
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.400]  John Kerry all but declared war in Syria.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.440]  Now why do I mention all that?
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:24.320]  Because it's exactly a year ago, but also because that's what has to happen now.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:30.760]  General Dempsey will be going to the summit in Wales, you know, I find it ironic because
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:38.120]  the real message for that summit is for the Welsh, because the basic problem here is that
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:44.360]  the U.S. welched on its promise to the Russian leaders that it would not move NATO.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:51.400]  One inch was the word James Baker used, one inch farther eastward than Germany if the
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.720]  Russians acquiesced in the reunification of Germany.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.720]  That was the deal.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:56.720]  Okay.
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.000]  That was the deal 25 years ago.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.520]  We welched on it, it seems to be the height of irony that we're meeting in the next NATO
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:08.160]  summit and where were the Welsh lived in Wales.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.160]  Anyhow, Dempsey is going to be going there.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.720]  There are other level-headed military people in NATO.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:23.800]  I'm just hoping that they can inject a modicum of reason into their calculations and realize
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:31.920]  that the Russians understandably are not going to tolerate drawing Ukraine into NATO, period.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:37.680]  I know that you worked in and around Henry Kissinger and here's the headline, the assembly
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:41.160]  of a New World Order Wall Street Journal just came out minutes ago.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:45.240]  The concept that has underpinned the modern geopolitical era is in crisis.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:52.160]  He goes on to praise Libya and Syria wars, civil wars that were staged and what's happened
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:58.200]  with Russia, it just sounds like the Prince of Darkness, Richard Perl bragging to women
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.320]  that he's a good killer or Obama saying he's good at killing people.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:07.200]  Last time I checked, he's never killed anybody with his own hands or pulled the trigger.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.640]  It just smells of the Titanic running into an iceberg.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:17.680]  It just smells of disaster to like see these crazied women.
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:21.640]  I'm not saying that because they're women but they look like crazy witches up there
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:27.600]  at the UN and at the State Department trying to start wars and looking crazed.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.360]  Do a few more minutes with us, I want to get your take on how we can deescalate this, where
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:32.360]  you think it's going.
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:37.480]  I want to play that clip of Putin but to see Henry Kissinger now running around licking
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:42.400]  his lips, how this is going to bring in the New World Order, I mean this is a key time
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:43.400]  folks.
[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:48.960]  Henry Kissinger has raised his head, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.680]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:59.480]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:04.880]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.600]  toxic each and every day.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.960]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:13.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.240]  than even outdoor air.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:19.400]  Most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.800]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.800]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.280]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.280]  to as well.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.400]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:40.640]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:45.720]  against, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:50.120]  The new InfoWarsLife Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.240]  with you throughout any toxic environment.

[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.920]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.800]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:10.600]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:14.920]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions especially the thyroid.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.120]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:23.560]  You now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:27.600]  Then about a year ago he said listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come out
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:33.920]  with rare earth, deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have had have been
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.440]  life changing.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.280]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:45.120]  This is innovating and the best part is it helps fund InfoWars.com, the radio show, the
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.680]  TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas for a limited time
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:53.160]  experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.

[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:03.840]  General what do you think about the FBI saying that there is a terror alert on Monday about
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.520]  a potential for good situation?
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.520]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:15.520]  Whether it's the radio show, the news, websites, documentary films or the nightly news, InfoWars
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.520]  is the tip of the spear.
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.520]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote homelink
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.040]  security by sticking the hands down on our pants on the streets?
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:27.320]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:30.000]  prisonplanet.tv is designed to do.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.040]  If you watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.360]  against the so-called rebels.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.840]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth.
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:47.400]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv

[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:08.600]  There's a need for a new world order but it has different characteristics in different
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.560]  parts of the world.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:40.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:34:02.080]  I get excited about geopolitical movements, I get excited about our own government and
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:07.720]  foreign governments allowing al Qaeda now named IS to be armed and to take over areas
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.480]  of Syria.
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:13.560]  I get upset about that, average folks get upset about baseball or football and yelling
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:18.480]  scream, that's supposedly normal, sure I like a good ball game as much as the next guy.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:25.660]  But I get upset and get emotional, I intellectually look at the facts but then I do emotionally
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.160]  get upset on air.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:32.680]  It's real because I'm passionately trying to get you to become passionate about what's
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:35.560]  happening out there so we don't become radioactive.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:41.640]  The old saying is get active or get radioactive and the Russian government, the communist government
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.400]  did a lot of wicked horrible things.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.200]  I'm a fan of Alexander Sultz and Eatzen, I'm an anti-communist folks, everybody knows
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.560]  that I'm a free market capitalist, I know it's the best system in the world, it's not
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:56.120]  perfect because you get oligarchal corruption in it.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:01.440]  But you look at Russia today, this is causing them to become more authoritarian just to
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:05.360]  hold it together which is sad because I want Russia to become more free.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:13.440]  I want prosperity, I know Ray McGovern wants that and it's so immoral to watch our government
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:17.920]  and our elites doing this but they're not even doing it from cold-blooded positions
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:22.240]  of evil, I mean they are in many respects.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:32.240]  They are doing it from just a self-destructive spirit that really concerns me when I look
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.240]  at it.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:43.160]  It's like it's a big joke to them and I really in my bones have a lot of genuine anxiety
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:47.280]  right now and Ray McGovern briefed Ronald Reagan and George Robert Walker Bush, he was
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.680]  their top briefer, I know he's all about being calm and breaking things down but Ray in your
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:36:00.240]  gut and in being with the CIA almost 40 years and all the rest of it, talking to other analysts
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.600]  knowing General Dempsey stopped the takeover of Syria for al-Qaeda, now that turned back
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:11.320]  around and run into Iraq, it's almost like the devil came up with this Machiavellian
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:16.840]  strategy because I can see the destabilization strategy but it's so destructive and Kissinger
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:23.560]  saying out of this swirling black hole that we'll have a Pax Americana while this same
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:28.800]  elite has deindustrialized us and done everything they can to shut us down, it just seems like
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:34.920]  bad will, it seems like existential envy by a ruling class against anything and everything,
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:40.640]  I know I'm pontificating here but on a scale of 1-10 what would you say the danger of this
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:45.480]  new cold war leading to a regional war or even a nuclear war is because when you've
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:50.840]  got Putin and others saying hey we have nuclear weapons it's just it's such a sinking feeling
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.840]  as my point.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:58.960]  Well judging from the president's attitude yesterday, well he made it very clear we're
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:06.640]  not going to get involved in a military conflict with Russia, this cutting 180 degrees away
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:12.880]  from what a lot of his advisors are doing and saying, you can see a kind of a Hamlet
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:18.680]  type calculation on Obama's part, I don't know how it's going to come out, what we'll
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:27.200]  know more is after the NATO summit on the 5th of September we'll know if there's a degree
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.560]  of realism with the Germans for example who up until now have been led down the Gordon
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:40.040]  path by the US, the French as well, major countries with one exception and that was
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:44.080]  it wouldn't go along with a war of aggression against Iraq.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:48.640]  The question really is whether the Germans and the French are led by leaders now that
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.800]  have the courage to stand up and say look you know we know what a war of aggression
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:57.080]  is we're not going to perpetrate one by ourselves.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:02.320]  Now the other thing is I just like to pick up on Henry Kissinger, my father was a lawyer
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:11.360]  and he used to talk about the age of statutory senility, Henry Kissinger reached the age
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:17.160]  of statutory senility about at least a decade ago and so he doesn't make a lot of sense
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:21.920]  except every now and then when he's asked the specific question, they asked him one
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:29.440]  month ago are the Russians right and feeling threatened by NATO coming into Ukraine and
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:35.880]  he said of course they are, that's crazy, who else said that, Svig Brzezinski, no coddler
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:42.880]  of the Russians, so these real politic guys are smart enough to realize what a dumb move
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:51.680]  this will be if NATO doesn't rescind its decision six years ago to cooperate in Ukraine as
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:52.680]  a member.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:59.600]  So those are important things, now the other things Alex, why do they do this, what are
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.600]  they doing this, you know, well some of the political scientists, some whom I admire, John
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:10.160]  Mursheimer of the University of Chicago for example, talks about liberalism, run them
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:16.280]  up, you know, we're the sole indispensable country in the world, that by definition means
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.120]  all other countries are dispensable and we're going to show them how to put democracy in
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:27.800]  places like Russia, you know, that may be some of it, but I think most of it is money,
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.760]  I think most of it is what generalize and how, presidentize and how are warned against
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:39.400]  the military industrial, now we have the military, industrial, congressional, media, security
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:47.040]  state complex, much more dangerous, okay, so how do I look at it, well, Larry Wilkerson
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:52.280]  who worked for Colin Powell as his chief of staff, I was on the television yesterday
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:59.600]  and what he said was this, look, we at the end of the Berlin Wall caving, we said let's
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.520]  invite the Russians into NATO, if you're going to keep NATO let's invite them in and
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.880]  they were rebuffed, okay, they were rebuffed, why?
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:19.920]  Because Lockheed Martin, very a fun, wanted to sell a whole bunch of arms to Poland and
[01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:26.040]  other countries and for them to buy the arms, they had to have a big threat, right, and
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:30.760]  so there's the ready made threat, Russia, more recently, I want to just read you one
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:38.240]  paragraph of this news report, Ukraine, this is Bloomberg, okay, Ukraine troubles are leading
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:44.920]  western governments to renew the role of the weapon that dominated the Cold War, the battle
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:52.760]  tank, the cost and war fighting benefits of developing a common armored vehicle for the
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:41:01.320]  whole region could spur consolidation beyond the pending merger of Germany's Mafei Weikmann
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:13.120]  and France's next systems as the CEO of Mafei says, so you have a common battle tank now,
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:19.160]  which was sort of dead in the water because there was nobody to use the tank again, yes,
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:24.680]  now we have the tank, now we can get the tank built, now we can make lots of money, so you
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:31.880]  know, in the old days, I used to think explaining everything by, you know, who we bono, who's
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:36.640]  going to make all the money, that was a little simplistic, I still think that not everything
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.920]  can be explained by that, but if you look at what happens, if you look at who profits
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:45.360]  from this kind of tension, and who, you know, who's going to make all the money, it's the
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.360]  1% Alex, it's not the rest of us.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:51.160]  But if there's a nuclear war, they're not going to have anywhere to spend this money.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:57.160]  Yeah, I think we're a couple of steps away from that now, partly because Putin is smart
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:03.360]  enough to not perpetrate that, and Obama I think knows a little bit more than we give
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:04.360]  him credit for.
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.320]  But what I'd like to finish up saying is that last year at this time, okay, there were
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:14.120]  two really important things that happened, not only were they trying to get a war going
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:18.960]  against Syria, but the congressmen and senators were home.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:24.960]  They were in their districts, and the American people got up and said, no more war, okay.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.360]  The British parliament, for the first time in modern history, turned the prime minister
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:33.240]  down and said, no, we're not going to vote for war in Syria.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:39.120]  First time in hundreds of years, yeah, first time in hundreds of years, that's a great
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:40.120]  point.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:44.560]  So you think Obama's statement yesterday signals maybe a de-escalation?
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:49.440]  Why would Putin come out today and say, hey, we'll defend ourselves, we have nuclear weapons,
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.440]  watch it.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:57.360]  Do you think that that is to basically escalate it in the news to the level of understanding
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.520]  in the public to force a debate about the stakes here?
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:06.800]  Yes, Putin is painfully aware that NATO is meeting at the summit level in Wales on the
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:12.440]  4th and 5th of September, he just wants to remind all these folks, including that Dane,
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:18.480]  who was the secretary general, and you sort of froths at the mouth, and says, yeah, we're
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:27.120]  going to place units real close to the Russian border, and we're also going to modernize,
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:31.160]  modernize the Ukrainian military, and there's a lot of money in modernization.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.880]  So he's just laying down a marker and say, look, in case you hadn't thought about it,
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:42.280]  we're not a weak country like we were 25 years ago, and of course we have the continuing
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.800]  nuclear deterrent.
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:48.000]  So that's how I read that.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.480]  You're getting back to what really concerns me, because I've been a student of politics,
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:55.520]  I always found it very interesting geopolitics, military affairs.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.720]  People were always corrupt and had problems, they were good guys, bad guys, but people
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.160]  were more serious.
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:07.800]  Now, when I see the mannerisms and the meetings and in Hillary saying, we came to Libya, we
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:15.120]  saw he died, Obama, I'm good at killing people, Pearl hits on girls at cocktail parties saying,
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.600]  I kill a lot of people.
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:24.040]  I see these statements and weirdness and swaggering that you see in people that have never really
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:29.320]  physically been involved in violence themselves, who think it's tough, who think it's sexy,
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:32.500]  who think they're like General Zod in a Superman movie.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:35.160]  This is the real world, our only planet.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:40.280]  This is not a game, and that's what keeps me up at night now is, like you mentioned,
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:45.680]  the Secretary General and people, some of these folks are frothing at the mouth with
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:48.320]  just incendiary stuff at Russia.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.520]  And then Russia, like you said a few weeks ago, was like, yeah, we kind of like to keep
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:55.920]  our port we've had for hundreds of years, but we want to be friends with you, and then
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.760]  our media is like, they want to kill us, they're going to murder us, and finally, Russia's
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.280]  saying, okay, yeah, we have nuclear weapons, you need to stop now.
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:09.160]  Yeah, I mean, the propaganda offensive in this country in the West reached ridiculous
[01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:17.240]  proportions when the Russians had those 280 trucks to bring provisions, including baby
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:23.360]  food and that kind of thing, into these besieged areas around the Niesk and the Viennes.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:30.640]  And the media here and the propagandists were saying, look, there must be weapons in there,
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:35.840]  there must be weapons, even though there were 59 inspectors that ran through those trucks
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:42.600]  at will, well, they will hold up for a whole week, mind you, a whole week before the Russians
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.840]  said, oh, we're not going to wait any longer, we're going to go in and distribute this.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:56.000]  Bring yourself as a parent, a parent of a baby that needs formula, that needs milk, and you're
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.600]  hearing that the Russians are going to bring it, but they can't get, they don't have the
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.000]  right papers to get through the reading customs.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.520]  Well, there were no weapons on those trucks, and we know that.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.800]  And so it's just sort of this artifact.
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:12.920]  I agree, that was confirmed, and we don't know what happened with the airliner and the
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:20.000]  rest of it, but clearly, I believe this signifies Putin's statement, though, because I've watched
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.680]  some of the segments of the two and a half hour talk, where he goes, well, yes, some
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:26.800]  Russian troops got picked up, they'll be brought back, they're just helping everybody
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.520]  laugh, and he laughs.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:33.080]  Clearly they've got troops guarding their bases, that's on record, and sure, they are
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:39.480]  doing aid convoys, but I think his statement about nukes, I think it marks a quiet escalation
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.680]  where they realize being nice hasn't worked, and I'm predicting you are going to see more
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:51.320]  Russian troops basically infiltrate, not exfiltrate, and I think this is a major sign of a hardening
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:57.280]  in the Russians, which some would say is bad, some would say is good, because the only thing
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:02.720]  that the globalists see is strength, that's the only thing that they tend to back off
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:03.720]  from.
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:08.320]  Yeah, Alex, one thing that's really necessary to appreciate, and that is the situation on
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.960]  the ground in southeastern Ukraine.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:18.120]  Now, contrary to the public, the propaganda picture in the West, which had the Ukrainian
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:26.960]  army winning surrounding Donetsk and some of the other cities, the so-called separatists,
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:33.960]  which are really federalists, so anti-Ku federalists that speak Russian mostly, they surrounded
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:41.000]  these inept Ukrainian troops, and so the tide turned exactly two weeks ago, and it was before
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.720]  the Russians ever came in, if indeed they've come in in significant numbers.
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:51.600]  And so this is sort of a face-saving excuse for the fact that the Ukrainians are taking
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:57.000]  it on the chin, a lot of them ran away, they left rockets behind them, we have photos showing
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.240]  all that, they're undisciplined, and so it was the pro-Russian, if you want to call them
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:08.120]  that separatists that were starting to win, and all of a sudden, how are they going to
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:09.760]  explain that to the world?
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:14.160]  It must be those darn Russians that the Russians came in en masse.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:22.200]  The photos, the satellite photography that NATO brought forth yesterday, as an intelligence
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.640]  professional, Alex, I'm embarrassed.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:31.000]  I mean, you couldn't tell anything from those photos, and if that's the best they have,
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:38.720]  if that's the best they have, from commercial satellite photography, you know, it's really
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:44.800]  stretches the credulity to think that they have any good evidence at all that's substantial
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.200]  members of the Russians.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:50.080]  Well, I agree, but I wouldn't blame the Russians guarding the infrastructure they paid for
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:51.760]  and that they have contracts on.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.920]  Well, sure, all I'm saying is that that would be reasonable, and some of that no doubt is
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:04.560]  happening, but the evidence is not what is presented by NATO and by the U.S.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:11.040]  The other thing is that Putin has deliberately adopted a kind of a laissez-faire, a kind
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:13.640]  of a laid-back attitude.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:21.360]  What he said last night was, look, you Ukrainians that we support politically, at least, be
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:27.840]  aware that you may have captured a couple hundred Ukrainian government forces, but
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:35.440]  let them go, get a corridor back into the Western Ukraine, let them go for Pete's sake,
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:40.840]  and we expect them to let those 12 guys that they captured the most, let's not make this
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.840]  into a big complication.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:48.120]  Now, I have to tell you, that's a much more statesman-like attitude than anything we're
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:52.120]  seeing out of NATO or out of Washington.
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:53.120]  That's it.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.440]  We don't see anything diplomatic out of the West anymore.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:01.280]  It's all just thuggish, Al Capone had more grace than these guys, and that's what concerns
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:02.280]  me.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:09.880]  That's true, and Jack Matlock, who used to be our ambassador in the Soviet Union and
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:16.640]  in Russia, in his most recent writing, he said, you know, this name calling of the kind
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:23.720]  you heard Samantha Power do yesterday, it's not doing any good.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:30.120]  We don't say at the UN that we haven't heard a word of truth from Russia.
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:34.760]  Indeed, most people know you've heard more truth from Russia than you have from Samantha
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:35.760]  Power.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.880]  So who does she think she's kidding?
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:43.200]  I guess the American public, and the sorry fact, Alex, is that, except for your show
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.200]  and others like it, Americans are being kidded.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:50.680]  Well, sir, thank you so much for the time, and have a great weekend, and hopefully we
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:52.080]  can de-escalate this.
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:54.800]  Ray McGovern, RayMcGovern.com, thank you so much, sir.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:55.800]  Most welcome, Alex.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.800]  Thank you.
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.800]  We'll be back with your call.
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.800]  Stay with us.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:28.480]  This hour brought to you by InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:30.640]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:32.200]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.760]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:36.560]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:38.800]  I've helped thousands, and I can help you too.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:42.720]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement, and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:43.720]  case.
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:47.480]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.440]  Burglars call it smashing grab.
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:12.360]  Police call it robbery.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:14.240]  We call it avoidable.
[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:20.360]  We are FAKE TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:25.680]  FAKE TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:30.280]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.880]  on to an easier target.
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:38.640]  At only $29.95, FAKE TV costs less than a month of most alarm-monitoring plans and comes
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:39.960]  with free shipping.
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:47.000]  Order your FAKE TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to FAKETV.com.

[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:22.920]  transmission.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.440]  We have InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight, 7 o'clock with our great reporters and investigative
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.960]  journalist and crew.
[01:54:29.960 --> 01:54:36.240]  I want to go to Will and I want to go to Chris and Chris and Anthony and Habu.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.640]  I don't really make folks hold that long, but I got you on before, then our guest, we're
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:41.560]  able to get him, came on.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:44.120]  Just briefly, I've skipped two breaks today.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:46.360]  I've not plugged anything.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:50.560]  We fund our operation, selling high-quality products at the best prices.
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:58.280]  Businesslife.com has the best, in my view, in research, fancy, super high-quality nutraceuticals
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:01.400]  at prices below the competitors blowing them away.
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:08.240]  X2 iodine that is so much more palatable than other iodines, and it's just amazing from
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:10.200]  the rare earth crystal sources.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:16.760]  The Occupower, which we are almost sold out of at current sales rates by next week or
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:20.360]  Monday or so, we should be sold out of this.
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:25.480]  We'll have more in a few months, but amazing eye formula, similar to DNA force, but it
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:27.560]  mainly focuses on the eyes.
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:30.600]  We've got super male vitality, super female vitality.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:36.120]  More of the silver bullet came in, super colloidal silver at a very low price, a major grocery
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:39.400]  store chain that puts out organic food, everybody knows its name.
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:43.120]  This is the same stuff they've got, but it's $9 more with them.
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.080]  It comes from the same high-quality lab, private label for us.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:47.080]  Just give an example.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:52.520]  It's $19.95 with us, it's $29.95 with them, and that just gives you an idea of what's
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:53.520]  going on here.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:56:00.320]  A lot of the stuff in there is now sold out, more is coming in, infowarslife.com.

[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:43.160]  Okay, let's go, again, it's critical that you be present at planet.tv members.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.880]  It's critical that you spread the word about the broadcast, it's critical.
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:50.720]  There's not many operations like this, and we appreciate all of your support spreading
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:53.920]  the word, we appreciate all we try to do is tell the truth.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:56.000]  The globalists want gun control, we're against it.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.480]  They want open borders, we're against it.
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:00.720]  They want satellite tracker boxes in your cars, we're against it, they want to attack
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:01.720]  you, now it's admitted.
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:03.840]  They want to start a war with Russia, we're against it.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:06.520]  They want to find al-Qaeda, we're against it.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:10.680]  We just try to be moral here, I want to sleep good at night, I don't want to have a nuclear
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.680]  war.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:15.200]  My kids are my kids, they don't belong to MSNBC, like they say.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:19.080]  I'm sick of it, I don't want to be pushed around, and if I'm a traitor for not wanting
[01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:20.840]  nuclear war, so be it.
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:25.000]  Let's talk to Will in Arizona, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:32.480]  Hi Alex, my name is Will from Phoenix, Arizona, and I have like four points, and first off
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:35.280]  I am a prison TV planet member.
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:39.000]  Awesome brother, go ahead and do your points, and I'll hold you over if you need me.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.440]  Okay, alright, first one is, I think that with regards to everything that's going on
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:48.760]  with Russia, I think we need to remember who dropped the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:51.720]  Because if anybody's going to drop a nuke, it's going to be the U.S., and we're going
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:54.400]  to do it a first strike.
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.400]  I'm almost betting.
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:04.560]  Second, if you really want to have an unbridged idea of what is going on today, look at, it's
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:12.520]  actually a YouTube video, but it's a documentary, Adolf Hitler, what is it, the greatest story
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:15.560]  never told, it's about five hours long.
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:20.560]  It doesn't gratify him, it doesn't try to say that he wasn't, you know, a terrible
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:24.960]  person at the end of the war and things to that effect, but it does give more of an unbridged
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:30.600]  documentary concept of what was going on, and how America funded Britain.
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:36.320]  Oh, it's on record that the leech, the robber barons, J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, put
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:37.320]  Hitler in.
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:38.320]  That's a fact.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:42.240]  That's a mainline Pulitzer Prize winning books, Shears, Rise and Fall, Third, Right.
[01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:43.240]  You bet.
[01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:47.000]  It's like they created Saddam bin Laden, stay there, I'm coming right back to you.
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.720]  I'm going to let you finish your points, Will, third hour.
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:53.280]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:56.200]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:00.400]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:05.320]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:08.520]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:13.120]  You now know it as survival shield, true, nascent iodine that your body can really
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.120]  absorb.
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:17.560]  Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:23.640]  come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals, and the results that I personally have had
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:25.800]  have been life changing.
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:30.640]  Iodine has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:35.480]  This is innovating, and the best part is, it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show,
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:39.200]  the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:43.520]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:52.640]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[01:59:52.640 --> 02:00:05.680]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:10.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:11.480]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:13.640]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:17.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:22.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:31.760]  All right, we're talking to Will, and we're going to Chris and Habu and another Chris
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:32.760]  and Anthony.
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:34.240]  Thanks for holding, guys.
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:35.640]  Will, finish up your points.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.440]  Start over with number one.
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:42.560]  Well, number one is just the fact that we're concerned with what Putin said.
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:46.880]  If we need to be concerned about any country dropping a nuke, I think it's America because
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:52.880]  we're the only ones that have dropped bombs like that, Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:53.880]  America is unscrupulous.
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:01:00.720]  The second issue is, I wrote an article called Obama Arming Terrorist, The Breakdown of Government
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:06.000]  Crime, and what I said in there was, is last year when he was going to arm the terrorists,
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.480]  they went in and they said that they were able to do it because there was like some
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:19.120]  manipulative language in the ability to arm terrorist organizations, yada, yada, yada.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:25.920]  And I went in and I said under Title 18, USC Part 1, Chapter 113B, Section 2339, they
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:28.120]  can't do that, no matter what.
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:31.360]  Nobody even brought him up on charges for that.
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:36.640]  Second, Obamacare, my wife works for the federal government, okay?
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:39.960]  But she doesn't work, she's a contractor.
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:46.520]  And she works for a company that deals with medical benefits for the military.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:48.880]  And she has healthcare with them.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:55.320]  When Obamacare rolled out her monthly payments every two weeks, we'll have $40 every two
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:56.320]  weeks.
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:58.320]  Now, it's $300 every month.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:03.320]  My dad's healthcare's doubled, mine's doubling.
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:07.520]  It's all a giant screw job, but we're racist, you know, it doesn't matter if the bill gets
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.520]  bigger.
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:11.960]  Obamacare got smaller, so that's the truth.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.160]  If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:16.080]  That was a fraud committed on the American people.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:21.560]  I do not understand why a class action suit isn't promulgated by numerous citizens.
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.520]  Because that's the thing about lawlessness.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:29.320]  The border is wide open while they got armored vehicles driving up and down the street for
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.320]  us.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:33.280]  Look, the government's gone, folks.
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.000]  It's not even a debate about are you anti-government, pro-government.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  It's not even a government.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.280]  It's just a free-for-all screw job with a bunch of crazy bankers trying to start war
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:43.280]  with the Russians.
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.880]  I mean, it's just crazy town.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:46.880]  Anything else?
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:52.240]  I go back to the greatest story he'd never told that I was talking about earlier.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:57.440]  He actually kicked out a lot of the bankers because they were trying to implode Germany
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:59.280]  after World War I.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:00.280]  And it was the bankers.
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:03.760]  And when I was watching that, it was five hours long, and I started listening and saying
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:06.600]  to myself, wait a minute.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:10.640]  Everything that Alex talks about with regard to history is right on point.
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:15.720]  They are just repeating history, but because we are so dumbed down in the sense of our
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:17.600]  historical knowledge, right?
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:22.600]  You see, it's more sophisticated than that.
[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:29.280]  Certain robber baron elites went and tried to put Hitler in power, and then separately
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:33.680]  we can say that Hitler kicked out bankers, which are saying it's code for Jews.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:36.720]  When I use the word banker, it's not code for Jews.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:41.440]  It's more complex than that, that you've got combines of ancient Jewish families that
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:46.000]  have been banking and basically running pawnshops is where it all came from for about 3,000
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.320]  years.
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:51.000]  And so Jews didn't invent fractional reserve banking.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.960]  Money changing has gone on all over the world, and I'm not defending some of the Jewish mafias
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:59.040]  that are out there that use political correctness to protect their operations.
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:00.880]  But I mean, again, you get back to Hitler.
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:05.760]  I haven't seen the documentary you're talking about, but people can, I guess, check it out
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:07.840]  for themselves.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:12.360]  My point is these systems of evil can be deployed and used by anybody.
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:15.520]  It is true that Putin arrested a bunch of oligarchs.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:19.800]  Some of them Rothschild connected, so that's going on as well.
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:24.600]  But the Rothschild arm helped Hitler some, and then Hitler even killed some Rothschilds
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.600]  in France.
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:31.440]  So it's just a greedy, screwed up system with a bunch of different special interests jumping
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.400]  in and grabbing.
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:38.600]  There are well-organized, what I'd call Jewish mafias that are involved in it, but there's
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:40.560]  other organized mafias as well.
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:44.680]  I think we depoliticize it when we call it mafias, because that's what it is, because
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:49.160]  the average Jew out there, I'll assure you, has nothing to do with stuff like that that's
[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.160]  going on.
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:54.080]  They're just as ignorant as the general public at large.
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:55.800]  But the major point's very interesting.
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.160]  We'll be back with more calls.
[02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:00.000]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.120]  Another major health threat.
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:05.360]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.360]  the water.
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:08.720]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:14.400]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.720]  single day?
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:18.800]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.640]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:26.240]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:27.240]  was.
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:32.560]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:35.880]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:38.960]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:44.960]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system is a must-have for every modern, independently

[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:33.080]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:37.440]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.480]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:45.040]  Infidel body armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:48.120]  priced and fully legal, but for how long?
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:55.120]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor.com.
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:59.480]  Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:03.040]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:05.960]  much get healthy and detoxify.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:10.720]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:15.080]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:18.280]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:23.520]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:27.520]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:33.400]  out with rare earth, deep earth crystals, and the results that I personally have had
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:35.560]  have been life changing.
[02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:40.420]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:45.280]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the

[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:05.880]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:08.000]  Government is the problem.
[02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.200]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:18.040]  to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government
[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:24.680]  for, by, and of the people.
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:29.880]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:37.240]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:40.200]  Nobody else made that happen.
[02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:46.360]  You've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:51.000]  separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.480]  Now warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:57.560]  You should reject these voices.
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:05.200]  I'd like to read the comments on infowars.com for one of your phone calls here in just a
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:06.200]  moment.
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:11.680]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:13.680]  objectives that we've set.
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:19.400]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:23.800]  just as well funded.
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:30.000]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.080]  We posted a blurb of that Reuters article in a blog that we went and found the actual
[02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:38.760]  video and added it to it at infowars.com with Putin basically saying we have nuclear weapons
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:43.240]  don't mess with us, a major escalation.
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:48.800]  And Robert commented 27 minutes ago, the West will stick Russia with pins and needles, but
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:49.800]  they will not attack.
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.440]  There will be no open war with Russia.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:58.600]  Between Russia and the West, the satanic banking cult which runs the Western world does not
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:03.920]  want to hand over a burned out sender of the planet to their god Lucifer.
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:09.520]  The satanic cult will slowly strangle Russia economically until the Russian people scream.
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:13.600]  The CIA will enter Russia, they will finance political dissidents.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.080]  The dissidents will rally the economically pressured Russian people to Orange Revolution.
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:25.000]  The Orange Revolution will result in a political turnover Putin replaced with a preselected
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.720]  Western Allied leader.
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:32.120]  The new leader of Russia will lead the Russian people into the new freedom, and that new
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:36.800]  freedom will be a giant black hole with a smiley face painted on it.
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:39.480]  Ooh, I want to steal that term.
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:42.840]  The new old order, like this is an Alex Jones quote, I'd like to take something and add
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:43.840]  to it.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:49.960]  The new world order is a giant black hole with a smiley face painted on it.
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:53.240]  It's not stealing if you openly say you're stealing.
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:57.360]  Robert, thank you so much for your points, and that black hole will be the new world
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:58.360]  order.
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:04.000]  That's crazy, I was just scrolling through the comments and hadn't even read to the
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.120]  bottom yet, and then he made that point.
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:09.600]  I bet subconsciously I already read the line beneath it, and that's why I said that.
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:14.920]  I'm thinking, no, no, no, it ought to be the new world order is a giant black hole with
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:17.240]  a smiley face painted on it, but he said it better.
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:21.760]  He said it will be a giant black hole with a smiley face painted on it, and that black
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:23.240]  hole will be the new world order.
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:28.000]  Well, I don't want to be racist and compare that to Obama, so I'll say a giant white hole.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.640]  It's actually, they think a lot of black holes actually have all this light going into them,
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:38.360]  and before it goes past the event horizon, black holes are blazing with suns and with
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:41.960]  nebulas, and some of them are so big with galaxies being sucked in.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:47.000]  So, the new order, and Obama is like a giant blazing white light.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:50.520]  Stay away from the light, Carol Ann, away from the light.
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:53.360]  It's a giant bug zapper flapping into it.
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.360]  I want my free healthcare.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:57.800]  I go, I want my Obama phone.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:00.920]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:04.000]  I want my free shots.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.480]  I mean, how does anyone think anything the federal government wants to do is going to
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:08.480]  be good?
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:15.320]  Oh, man, we are in trouble, and they've got this huge industrial country fully under globalist
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:20.120]  control and can just get away with anything now, except controlling themselves.
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:23.480]  See, the elite do have control almost over the whole world right now.
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:31.420]  A few countries they've got to get control of, but they're going to destroy themselves
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:33.480]  because of the arrogance.
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:39.320]  Urgent Obama to interrupt weekend fundraising trip will return to DC, over Putin, and the
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:45.840]  new threat, basically.
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:50.240]  And then, meanwhile, New York is on alert for ISIS attack, England has a super high
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:56.680]  alert, and they're saying terror chatter is up as 9-11 anniversary approaches.
[02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:04.680]  Terror chatter, ISIS al-Qaeda in Iraq is allowed to use Twitter and Facebook, and then when
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:08.320]  people said, why is that, they had an article in the Washington Post going, we need to know
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:10.320]  what they're up to.
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.320]  That's right.
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:18.080]  I post music that we've produced and that we own, and we get copyright strikes.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:25.520]  We post a video showing none of the beheading, but talking about it, and they block the video
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:31.160]  on our Prison Planet live channel that gets millions of views a week.
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:33.000]  And that's just automated.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:38.120]  So we can't decry ISIS and show no violence, but talk about how horrible they are, but
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:41.760]  ISIS can run around recruiting, and they're popping up at the White House, they're popping
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:47.320]  up in Ferguson, they send us threats, and we go, and it's like major sites, totally
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:48.320]  globalist run.
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:51.200]  I mean, let me tell you something, I've had enough.
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:55.440]  Some guy with a turban and a big beard wants to cut my head off, buddy, I mean, I'm getting
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:00.520]  sick of it, and I'm really getting sick of how it's in the news today, and then I'm going
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:07.040]  to your calls, I'm going to cover this if we go to calls, that they're saying the number
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:13.360]  one terror threat is domestic groups, al-Qaeda, or any Muslim extremists is not listed in
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:15.800]  the new FBI yearly report.
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:20.040]  It doesn't exist now, because it's a real threat running around with black flags, killing
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:24.320]  hundreds of thousands of Christians, and then they're going to let these nuts come in here,
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:30.600]  who are killing non-radical Muslims everywhere as well, and blow stuff up, and then they'll
[02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:34.320]  use the NSA, the armored vehicles on the Tea Party, which is now admitted.
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:38.320]  I told you all these years ago, this would happen, and now because of ISIS threats and
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:43.000]  the Russia thing, Obama has run back to the White House, so that if there is an attack,
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.480]  it doesn't look like he was being lazy.
[02:14:44.480 --> 02:14:48.960]  Let me tell you, and I've warned you, when Obama goes off his vacation, you better watch
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:53.520]  out, because something big is about to happen, and he's got to be there when they make the
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:56.240]  big announcement like the fake bin Laden raid.
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:01.320]  He went off vacation for that, announced it on Sunday night to dominate the entire news
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:02.320]  cycle.
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:06.600]  They're getting ready to pull something big, Kissinger just rose his ugly head.
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:09.600]  I mean, it's just, these people are out of control.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:12.480]  Look at Dianne Feinstein strutting around with him.
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:18.160]  I'll tell you what marks the globalist, I don't care if they're Barack Obama, or Al Gore,
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:22.800]  or any of them, is the arrogance and the enjoyment of being in front of people.
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:27.560]  Let me tell you, I want to be fishing, I want to go visit Europe, I want to go spend time
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:32.040]  with my children, I want to oil paint, I do not want to be up here grandstanding.
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:37.440]  I don't get a thrill out of it, but I realize people go with big studios and sports jackets
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:41.200]  and people that look healthy, and so I'm getting, I'm going that direction, just to get the
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:44.200]  message out and beat these people, but I never wanted to be on air.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:47.000]  I wanted to be a land management rancher.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:53.120]  I like to be outside, I like to shoot guns, but I've been forced to cope against the
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:58.080]  new world order because they're so dangerous, and because I will not be their slave, and
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:03.400]  I hope you share that vision with me to be free, thank you for holding Chris and then
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:04.400]  Chris.
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:06.960]  Let's go to Chris and Georgia, then Chris and Indiana, thank you for holding, Chris,
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.240]  you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:19.000]  Hi Alex, the Odeid-Yinon Agreement from 1982 Israel bears out the fact that Israel was
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.080]  set up as an ethnic cleansing state from the beginning.
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:30.240]  Look at a map of 1948 Palestine, all of the land that was occupied by Palestinians and
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:31.240]  look at it today.
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:36.240]  No, listen, listen, I agree with you that there's been a lot of ethnic battles going
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:40.800]  on there, of the folks that went in, bomb stuff to overthrow the British government
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:45.840]  there, there was a vacuum with the Turkish Empire collapsing, the remnants of the old
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:51.880]  Ottoman Empire collapsing, and in that vacuum came folks that wanted their own state.
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:57.620]  They wanted it to be in Russia, in eastern, southern Russia, but instead they were exiled
[02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:02.120]  basically by the Nazis and by the communists and sent down there and the Rothschilds bank
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:03.120]  rolled it.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:05.280]  So that's absolutely true.
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:10.360]  My point is though, no one wants to talk about ISIS killing hundreds of thousands of Christians,
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:13.800]  it's like they don't matter, it's only Palestine.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:19.800]  I mean Egypt won't take the Palestinians, Jordan won't take them, so what I'm saying
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:26.600]  is I'm not against the Palestinians, I'm just not lined up to obsess on Israel all day.
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:30.800]  I mean I don't go to churches that harp on Israel and worship Israel, I mean you talk
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:36.720]  about vomiting, I'm sick of hearing about Israel and I'm sick of how it's all one-dimensional
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:39.840]  the debates about it when it's so incredibly complex.
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:40.840]  Go ahead.
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:45.520]  But the thing is you just, you keep missing something, for one thing I've never heard
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:52.400]  you talk about Zionism, and Alex you've got a great show, I mean I'm a good piece of my,
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:53.760]  I'm 57 years old.
[02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:58.760]  Well you know why I don't talk about Zionism because I work for Israel man, I get a paycheck
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:04.360]  every day from Benjamin yet and yeah, come on Alex, I'm not going like that.
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:09.320]  Listen, I don't care, I'll explain something to you, it's like an allergic response.
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:13.920]  I've been attacked by the federal Nazis and the globalists in all these groups so much
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:18.000]  and claim that I'm a shill of Israel, that I don't care, you understand, I don't like
[02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:24.480]  a lot of stuff Israel does, the people that attack Israel want to blow it up literally
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:28.840]  hate me and are usually socialists and hate the fact that I own guns.
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.080]  So what I'm getting at here is I don't, I'm not involved in it.
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:38.520]  I'm sad that a couple thousand Palestinians died, okay, I really do, I like families and
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:39.520]  little kids and people.
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:44.080]  You have to understand though, I'm even more concerned about over a hundred thousand non-radical
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:51.200]  Muslims and over 200 plus thousand Christians murdered by the precious little jihadis that
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:55.320]  when I criticized Al Qaeda, I have leftists sending me threatening emails going they're
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:19:00.080]  part of a revolution as well, you, you know, you Jew, blah, blah, blah, we want to kill
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.080]  your family.
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:06.440]  I am sick of it, I'm not Jewish but I'm not going to run from that label so I am Jewish
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:07.440]  is my point.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:09.920]  I am Jewish, I work for the Rothschilds.
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:14.120]  Use those clips, okay, I don't care, take them out of context, of course I'm not Jewish,
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:18.040]  I don't work for the Rothschilds, never got a red cent from Israel, it's all lies.
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:23.100]  So what I'm telling you is the cause for lab, the thing I'm told to obsess about Israel
[02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:25.280]  all day isn't happening.
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:27.640]  I'll come back to you and let you finish and go to other collars, I don't want to cut
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:28.640]  you short.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:33.200]  It's like when people call me, it's the same thing with the Vatican bashers, I criticize
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:34.680]  the Vatican all day.
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:41.120]  I made a film about Israel attacking the USS Liberty to blame it on Egypt and start a war
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:44.280]  and the Jew bashers said it was a whitewash for Israel.
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:51.360]  Well, I don't make films like that to impress the Nazis and show them how, how cool I am.
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:57.480]  I make films about false flag because I have integrity, okay, I expose Israel selling prisoners
[02:19:57.480 --> 02:20:00.320]  organs and stuff because it's wrong not to kiss your butt.

[02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:21.040]  Here's the issue, I have integrity, I cover real news, I try to tell the truth, I make
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:28.080]  mistakes sometimes and people perseverate on Israel.
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:36.840]  We'll have an article about dollar devaluation or an article about NSA surveillance or an
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:42.760]  article about Governor Rick Perry can't own guns now because he's been indicted and like
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:47.440]  half the comments sometimes, I mean you can go check, all of this is the same person posing
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:55.640]  as like five people are crazily going ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju and I mean it's after a point, and it was
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:00.000]  the most beautiful song in the world after I'd heard it 50,000 times, I'd vomit if I
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  heard it again.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.320]  I think it's some type of cognitive infiltration thing because I know Cass Sunstein talked
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:10.600]  about that, putting things out so much that then people just get turned off by it like
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:15.240]  I got almost like anoculating people against it where there can be no real debate going
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:19.840]  on because everything's so polarized and I always ask people when they call and they
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:20.840]  go, what about Israel?
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:21.840]  What about Zionists?
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:26.760]  I go, okay yeah I think Israel's doing some pretty bad things but it's in the face of
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:30.840]  people saying we're going to kill all of you too and I understand you can say well Israel
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:37.200]  came in and blew up people and killed them and drove them out, well that did go on, it's
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:43.960]  just that I don't have a dog in that fight and compared to tens of thousands of Libyans
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:50.040]  every few months being killed by Al Qaeda forces our government put in, or Netanyahu
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.400]  saying yeah I kind of like what ISIS is doing and that was in the Jerusalem Post that let's
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:26:00.360]  let ISIS operate, that's very immoral to say they'll destabilize the Arabs and our enemies,
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:01.360]  let's be for it.
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:07.760]  Assad was doing nothing, Iraq, that's because Israel's secretly allied with Saudi Arabia
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:16.000]  folks, that's how you go after Benjamin Netanyahu who I don't have some personal hatred for.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:26.480]  I have reasoned research where no one in Israel should support Benjamin Netanyahu or Obama
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:31.200]  or anybody else when they are tacitly protecting Al Qaeda, that's why they're being bombed
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:34.320]  now because people turned against it in Israel in the US.
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:38.760]  You don't get Israel to listen to what you're saying, screaming about how Jews secretly
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:43.960]  drink people's blood at midnight, I mean it's just, it's meant to vulcanize people, it's
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:53.460]  divide and conquer, it's really that simple and I have had no group lie about me more
[02:26:53.460 --> 02:27:02.120]  than the self-righteous Israel haters and it's like a bullying on our website, Bash
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:08.200]  Israel, attack Israel, go after Israel and then one of our writers will write something
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:12.000]  critical of Israel and they'll just swarm in all you Jew lovers, you're trying to cover
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:17.880]  up, we're going to kill you too when we take over and I mean I don't want to be associated
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:25.240]  with that, that's not who I am, I'm not obsessed with Israel, I don't want war with Russia,
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:30.040]  I don't want war with China, I want free market, I want prosperity, I want to hang around
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:35.680]  people that have cool ideas and are inventors and I don't care what color they are but see
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:40.800]  everything's dumbed down to this stuff so you would think Israel and the 2,000 Palestinians
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:45.440]  and the 100 or whatever Israelis that just died is the center of the universe and it's
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:53.120]  almost, it's not almost in the Christian Zionist circles it is, Israel worship and even if
[02:27:53.120 --> 02:27:58.680]  you hate something but obsess on it you're worshiping it, that's why I don't even like
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:02.600]  bashing the New World Order because I want to transcend them with just ideas that are
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:10.360]  so good for freedom and prosperity that people just leave this system, it will fall but when
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:14.760]  you put names on it like it's the Jews or it's the Catholics or it's the Masons or it's
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:19.760]  the, there's diverse people in all those groups or it's the Russians or it's the, it's the
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:25.760]  Muslims, it's the, you then allow these political leaders to be kingpins over each political
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:30.640]  subdivision and they don't want the political subdivisions to be about where there's more
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:34.760]  freedom, where there's more prosperity, where there's smarter people, everybody migrates
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.800]  that, they want it to be about, ah, we're raising your taxes because of the neighbors
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:42.760]  and enemy and we want to kill them and really the president's just making money off of a
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:47.680]  defense stock they own, I've never in, and I'm going to go to break and come back with
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:50.680]  the calls, I promise I'll get to all of you, you've been holding forever it's just that
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:56.080]  these are heavy subjects being brought up, people aren't stupid, they've been taught
[02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:02.360]  how to be dumb and think real one-dimensional and I'm trying to get people to think outside
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:11.120]  the box, it doesn't even mean I've got all the answers, it's just that people call and
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:15.560]  they go, yeah, what do you think about the Vatican, Alex, what's talk about that and
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:19.200]  I do talk about the Vatican when it calls for world government or says space aliens are
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:26.800]  real or, you know, calls for a European Union expansion, I mean I do, well why don't you
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:30.240]  talk about the fellow preserving private, well I do, it's like this little mental game
[02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:35.800]  where, well why didn't you cover Bill Gates and Eugenics, it's like what, I don't want
[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:41.680]  to make it about me, you can call in and talk about Zionism if you want, it doesn't need
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:46.920]  to start with, why don't you talk about it, why don't I talk about it, man I am, I heard
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:53.200]  this record, we're on the march, the empires on the road, we'll go to your calls, Alex
[02:29:53.200 --> 02:30:01.960]  we'll go to your calls, this heavy subject, I began to get into iodine a few years ago
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:06.840]  because it was helping me and my family so much, get healthy and detoxify, most people
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:13.040]  know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world, iodine is key to so many
[02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:17.800]  of the body's functions, especially the thyroid, I discovered a product being developed by
[02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:23.640]  Dr. Group, you now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really
[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:27.800]  absorb, then about a year ago he said listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going
[02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:33.960]  to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have had
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:40.040]  have been life changing, nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals ladies

[02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:11.720]  the air outside that's toxic, indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:16.320]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:21.640]  time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes, there are more than 42 million smokers
[02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:26.080]  in the United States, well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous
[02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:30.120]  conditions and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're
[02:31:30.120 --> 02:31:34.440]  allergic to as well, when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was
[02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:39.440]  time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot

[02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:43.960]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning, I have drive to go to the gym, I feel like

[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:25.840]  to Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:28.840]  Larry claiming the former head of judicial watch is going to join us talking about the
[02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:34.920]  IRS persecution, but also a new judicial watch report, Feds Bulgen describes threat of imminent
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:37.320]  terrorist attack on the southern border.
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:43.320]  Yeah, and Obama will use that then to totally federalize it and conduit even more people
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:46.120]  in claiming he's trying to stop terrorists.
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:53.440]  I mean, ISIS is operating in this country, they're all over the place.
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:57.520]  We've gone from this 13-year war to eradicate al-Qaeda to it's bigger and stronger than
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:02.200]  ever because the criminals running our government gave them the weapons, but no one wants to
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:08.120]  talk about radical Islam that's now being turned loose to create the class of civilizations
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:15.440]  that will crush the majority of non-radical Muslims, that's the plan, along with the West,
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:19.080]  the globalists will play us off against each other like the two Siamese fighting fish
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:27.800]  and from Russia with love, from that clip, I'm going to cue that back up.
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:30.920]  You can see the setup.
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:36.880]  We got to have the NSO, we got to have all the C terrorists, yeah terrorists, you protected,
[02:34:36.880 --> 02:34:42.720]  it's so transparent, but you would think all that exists in the world.
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:50.760]  Here's what I'm sick of and the Israel bachelors are probably two or three times what the Catholic
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:57.640]  bachelors are, but I've noticed a lot of times it's the pro-Israel folks, they're trying
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:02.040]  to make it a conspiracy about the Vatican and then some of the Vatican people try to
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:07.240]  make it about Israel, so there's an old fight going on there, Catholic and Jews, well I'm
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:13.200]  neither, I was brought up a Protestant, I'm a Christian, I just have a relationship with
[02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:20.200]  Christ and I just understand the sociology, the anthropology and I'm just sick of opening
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:24.600]  up an article about Rick Perry can't buy guns and it's just Jew, Jew, Jew, Alex is a Jew,
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:32.680]  Jew, Jew, Jew, can you imagine how I feel when the people that hate Israel are so mindless
[02:35:32.680 --> 02:35:37.720]  and horrible on average, how do you think that makes people that want to legitimately
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:43.560]  criticize the Israeli lobby, who I do not like foreign lobbies, messing with our government,
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:49.360]  I have real issues with Israel, messing with our sovereignty, doing things like that, I
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:54.880]  have major issues with espionage, just like I do with the communist Chinese or others,
[02:35:54.880 --> 02:35:59.160]  but those are legitimate articles we put out that really do like, well why is Israel's
[02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:05.200]  government tacitly supporting IS, well why, and I don't put that out to attack Israel,
[02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:09.160]  I put it out for sanity's sake and what's going on, why is our government starting
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:17.800]  war with Russia, a man of many perversions, federal cybersecurity had convicted of child
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:29.800]  porn charges, the following story is a warning to why centralized power is so dangerous,
[02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:34.320]  I mean all the time they're busting high level, homeland security people and their child molesters,
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:39.160]  the mid level and low level they really never do because they're not, it's those key controller
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:45.320]  level people that the globalists don't put in, here's what I'm getting at, I've studied
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:51.080]  this, what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole, there are wasp mafias and Chinese triad mafias
[02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:58.720]  and Japanese mafias and Russian mafias and German mafias and Irish mafias and Mexican
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:05.760]  mafias and Brazilian mafias and Protestant mafias and Catholic mafias, humans organize
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:10.440]  into gangs, police are the biggest street gang out there, is it a good gang or a bad
[02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:16.160]  gang, well that depends on who runs the police, doesn't it, that's the thing about anarchy,
[02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:21.280]  if there wasn't a big gang in town there'd be some other big gang in town, see this
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:26.800]  is human nature, so it better be our big gang that's honorable and has chivalry, not somebody
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:34.920]  else's gang that's based on predatory activity, that's what it comes down to and so I am
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:43.400]  for a fraternity of liberty that transcends race, religion, creed, you name it, where
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:48.560]  you don't aggress against people that haven't aggressed against you, you believe in property,
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:52.320]  you believe in sovereignty, you believe in rights, as long as it doesn't hurt somebody
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:59.520]  else that builds wealth, that builds starships, that builds the future, I just really have
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:04.960]  good will towards everybody, I just really want to win, I want you to win, I get satisfied
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:10.040]  by prosperity, I just feel so good that I have some friends and people that I know I
[02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:16.080]  could go to jail for ten years and give them a million dollars and get out of jail in ten
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:23.080]  years and they would fight to keep that money and they would not cheat me, that's what
[02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:29.000]  value is and it's not just that they would, you know, or Colonel Travis giving his son
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:33.440]  to my mom's family to raise, because they were known as the most honorable people in
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:37.680]  Texas and it started the revolution and been the treasurer until he stepped down because
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:44.280]  he didn't want to be involved in it, heirs, it's not just that Colonel Travis would trust
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:54.800]  my family, that's just a small microcosm example, it is the trusting, it is the honorableness,
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:39:00.600]  that is my value, that is my wealth, that is who I am, that is my family name, I thought
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:06.880]  growing up everybody was like my family, straight and strong and honorable and hardworking and
[02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:12.920]  tough, I didn't know that a lot of people weren't like that, you understand that, and
[02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:19.480]  that's why I don't like people claiming I'm a Russian agent, major media figures, I could
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:26.040]  sue them, I could win, MSNBC saying I'm behind the Boston bombing and deeply racist, when
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:33.800]  I was younger if somebody said that in my face, I'd break their nose, I'm sick of people
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:38.560]  making stuff up like it's reality and it's not that it even hurts me, it's that you're
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:46.120]  so dishonorable and so pathetic that it makes me want to throw up, I'm mad at you because
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:51.520]  you're such cowards, I'm mad at you because you're so weak and it makes me see how weak
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:56.400]  I am, I know how weak I am, I want to be strong, I want to be a winner, I want to find the
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:01.720]  lever to turn things around, I want to turn the tide, I want to win because it's about
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:08.560]  my children and I'll tell you something else, I can feel my ancestors, the giant genetic
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:13.680]  variety of everything they strove to do and those genetic memories and it's more when
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:19.760]  I was driving to work and I was just literally just basking in the instincts and the memories
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:24.280]  and just all of them how strong they were and the good, the bad and the ugly, it was
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:29.840]  just like my God, this is incredible, consciousness on this planet and the people that merged
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:34.920]  over and over again to bring me to this point, I just want to get the ball across the line
[02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:41.120]  for humanity and not run around about blacks or Mexicans or Jews or Catholics or this or
[02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:50.920]  that, just come together for freedom no matter what color you are and the enemy will vaporize.
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:56.160]  The enemy could be black, it could be Jewish, it could be German, it could be Chinese, it's
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:41:03.080]  people that manipulate and want control and are haters and want to hurt people, the only
[02:41:03.080 --> 02:41:08.280]  people I want to hurt is them and that's why they're always stirring stuff up because they
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:11.880]  know they can get good people to do bad things once they started wars, it's important to
[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:15.400]  look past who they're trying to get us to start a war with and look at who's starting
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:21.360]  the war, I am sick, it'd be like watching a kid, a mean kid to a new kid that comes
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:26.040]  to school go hey, shake my hand, they pull their hand back or hey, you got something
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:30.160]  on your shirt and do it to your nose, my kids did that to me once so I was just like, why
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:34.560]  you look so angry I said because that's something people do to be mean and to say I'm unfaithful
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:39.040]  and to take someone's good will and like opening a door for a lady and then tripping
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:40.920]  her down the stairs.
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:44.920]  I had a newspaper reporter one time and my wife was pregnant with our first child who'd
[02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:51.480]  stalked me and harassed me and lied about me show up at a movie theater for a premiere
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:55.760]  of a film that I'd been invited to and there was Quentin Tarantino there looking at me
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:41:59.080]  hatefully in the crowd and the rest of it and I never told the story before and we walk
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:04.080]  up to those big giant stairs at the old Ritz, what it was called Alamo, the original Alamo
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:08.200]  Estelle Nationwide and that guy sat there and tried to trip my wife down the stairs
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:12.080]  and laughed and I looked and they had the other newspaper reporter there with a pad
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:16.280]  that I was about to physically attack him and she walked up and she said, how dare you
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:20.760]  not break that guy's neck and I said, that said you didn't fall, I caught you, that
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:21.760]  was a setup.
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:28.760]  Let me tell you, that reporter is a nobody piece of crap loser, excuse my French, but
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:31.840]  I'll tell you something about him, he doesn't work for black ops, he doesn't work for the
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:38.520]  CIA, he doesn't work, he doesn't need to be taught dirty tricks, it's a spirit of evil,
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:44.560]  a spirit of jealousy and I'm not going to be part of it, so that's what it comes down
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:51.720]  to, it's that men without honor tell men of honor that they're a fraud, no, I'm not
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:58.640]  a fraud, I am wicked in my flesh but my heart is good and I, by all yardsticks I'm a very
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:05.160]  moral person and I try to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:11.040]  and that's why I'm sick of the dumbing down out there, the mindlessness of all of this,
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:16.640]  okay, I'm not a Russian agent, I'm not a Israeli agent, I'm not a Catholic agent, I'm
[02:43:16.640 --> 02:43:21.600]  not a white supremacist agent, I'm not any of these things, I'm an agent of liberty,
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:28.240]  I'm an agent of freedom, I'm an agent of justice, I'm somebody that wants to uphold my family
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:32.520]  name not because it's some cheesy old saying but now as a man I know what that means, means
[02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:36.800]  I come from good people and I'm going to die a good person and it doesn't matter what they
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:42.840]  put in the newspaper or what they make up about me, I know I love God and I know I want
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:48.560]  justice and that's what matters and that's why evil men hate me because all those that
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:54.880]  love death hate God and if we love God they hate us, I'm going to go to your phone calls,
[02:43:54.880 --> 02:44:06.920]  Chris go ahead and tell us about the Zionist, go ahead, well you know I'm not accusing you
[02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:13.480]  of being what the Zionist said, I don't know why you do it, you do, can you get off the
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:17.200]  headsets we can hear you or I'll be accused of censoring you, just can you get off the
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:28.000]  headsets, I'm not accusing you of being a Zionist, I don't know why you do it, I just
[02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:34.800]  think that you're missing something, maybe you don't know, the Israel was set up from
[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:39.680]  the beginning as a state to ethnic cleanse the Palestinians out of there, I mean that's
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:44.880]  just basic fact, yeah and there are people moving into areas, colonizing it and kicking
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:50.240]  the natives out everywhere and I'm not saying that's good but no one cares when the UN lines
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:56.780]  up three or four thousand Africans in the Congo for a UN treaty and shoots them and
[02:44:56.780 --> 02:45:02.880]  burns down their village for a carbon sink, well Jews didn't do that, I mean what I'm
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:08.800]  saying is that, no do you understand two thousand Palestinians being killed is terrible, do
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:15.800]  you get hundreds of thousands of Christians being killed by the precious Muslim extremist?
[02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:29.520]  Exactly, we got Putin basically threatening nuclear war, no no I know I saw it up there,
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:33.720]  I saw it said Zionist and I went to you, we don't screen your calls unless it's on a specific
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:39.000]  topic, there's a YouTube, there's a YouTube, I can't say the title of it, it shows just
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:45.920]  about every Israeli reader, since Golden Lightyear and Ariel showed all of them with quotes
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:53.040]  of the things that they say about Palestinians, you think of the worst KKK rhetoric against
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:58.080]  black people in this country, no I will say this, there is a double standard in political
[02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:03.240]  correctness and political correctness is used to control, that's why Al Sharpton's allowed
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:08.000]  to say whatever he wants, no I get it, Israel has laws that you can't marry someone who's
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:13.640]  Jewish if you're there working in the country and I don't say that to bash Israel but they've
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:21.200]  got laws that haven't been in this country for 100 years, I understand that, so I mean
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:30.320]  we, you understand I made a film about false flag, actually two, that cover the USS Liberty
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:34.160]  Watch was a false flag but it was a false flag because governments played dirty and
[02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:41.160]  do that, not because it was Jews, see it's middle illness to say evil people are only
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:50.000]  Jewish, if people want to criticize bad stuff Israel's done that's fine, we should but it's
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.600]  like saying only a white cop or only a black cop can be racist, it's just not people are
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:01.320]  people is what I'm saying, on average Jews then they've got medical studies on this,
[02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:06.280]  have very high accused and you can say well this is the IQ test or cultural or whatever,
[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:10.880]  sure whatever but proof is in the pudding, you've got northern Europeans that have extremely
[02:47:10.880 --> 02:47:17.400]  just ultra high IQs, you've got Japanese on average have very high IQs but it's all like
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:21.760]  Olympic athletes like there's more Kenyan runners, you're only talking about like a few percentage
[02:47:21.760 --> 02:47:25.960]  points better than somebody from somewhere else, I mean all these points are very close
[02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:32.560]  to each other, it's just in the averages though, it's a very complex issue, so people don't
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:37.520]  like folks that have been successful, like I have built this operation on my own with
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:41.840]  the help of the listeners, grassroots, that's why it's done really good in some ways really
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:49.680]  bad in others because it truly is grassroots but we don't get the credit for that, people
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:55.760]  just say oh it was all paid for, it was all blah blah because they can't imagine someone
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:01.840]  else being successful, so I would encourage people that want to criticize Israel, I would
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:07.240]  do it from a serious perspective and really look at it and if you're going to cover Israeli
[02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:12.920]  atrocities cover Palestinian atrocities, I mean the stuff the Palestinians do dragging
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:16.200]  each other around behind motorcycles and running over people, it's just a bunch of
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:21.440]  tribal butchery and the Israelis are in a big tribal war, it's all a bunch of primitive
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:26.120]  baloney with the technocrats behind the scenes pushing the buttons, I'm really ranting I'm
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:34.600]  sorry, Chris in Indiana we'll go to Bruce and others, go ahead Chris, yep I'm here from
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:42.640]  FEMA region 5 in South Bend Indiana, former state of Indiana, I make it a point of honor
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:48.120]  to listen to your entire show every day Alex, thanks for putting up with me brother, yeah
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:53.920]  and I'd just like to say the clearly filtered water pitcher to my fridge right now, it's
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:59.400]  amazing how water tastes without all the poisonous pour out, it's not supposed to taste like
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:10.880]  kerosene, well look I am mad as hell and sick of these right wing Republicans who think
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:16.880]  that they are anti-establishment and you know the type, the type that religiously listen
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:22.200]  to people like Limbaugh, Hannity, Lars Larson, these people are even worse than Obama supporters
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:27.800]  if you ask me, I mean what good is being pro-gun if you worship the police state in all of
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:28.800]  these wars?
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:33.960]  I agree, no no it's like the Democrats have their segment of evils, it's the neocons,
[02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:40.400]  it's the fake conservatives, I mean the Republicans helped write with Ezekiel Emanuel the health
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:46.040]  care bill, I mean they should all be impeached, why hasn't Obama been impeached or okay let's
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:51.480]  not impeach him and fine, why hasn't Obama care been repealed?
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:56.600]  Because the establishment wants it, why hasn't Obama gotten in trouble for opening the borders?
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:00.680]  Because the rich Republicans want it, they want to drive down wages, they want to exploit
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:05.080]  people, they have bad will, good point anything else?
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:10.680]  Yeah, I mean these are the type of people that justify the checkpoints, body scanners,
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:15.640]  vaccines, the drug war, international conflicts, tax money going to the military industrial
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:20.840]  complex to purposely make too many bullets bombs and armored vehicles and then give it
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:26.080]  to local police to use and then they get all riled up and they get these people to be
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:30.800]  afraid of al-Qaeda to justify the police state and I tell people, I tell these people that
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:35.320]  I think they're anti-establishment, I'm like look, this is what being a real libertarian
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:40.360]  is, everything positive from both parties can throw out everything negative from both
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:43.360]  parties, I mean it might be an overgeneralization, but...
[02:50:43.360 --> 02:50:47.400]  Well I mean here's what mainline conservatives think, they think they're part of the establishment,
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:51.480]  they think the armored vehicles are for black people and that's why they first use it on
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:56.800]  black people as the rollout for America when it's really pointed at the Tea Party and old
[02:50:56.800 --> 02:51:00.200]  white guys, I mean that's what's happening.

[02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:08.760]  in a toxic colon.
[02:53:08.760 --> 02:53:12.960]  A toxic intestinal tract is the foundation for virtually all degenerative disease and
[02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:16.240]  a clean and well moving intestinal tract is the foundation of health.
[02:53:16.240 --> 02:53:19.160]  I just want to say that you folks have an amazing product.
[02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:23.040]  I've taken whey protein products for years and I've never noticed results I have with
[02:53:23.040 --> 02:53:24.040]  your product.
[02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:26.920]  I've suffered with thoughts and constipation most of my life.
[02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:30.720]  Within a few days of taking one world away, I noticed a dramatic change.
[02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:35.000]  Also in the past few years, I've experienced symptoms associated with diabetes.
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:38.480]  I feel horrible when I've had too much sugar and I've been getting the foot pain as well.
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:42.160]  But I've noticed in the past week or so I'm not feeling bad anymore and the foot pain
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:43.160]  is gone.
[02:53:43.160 --> 02:53:47.040]  I'm finishing up the five pound top I ordered and just got off the phone ordering more.
[02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:48.040]  I love your product.
[02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:49.040]  Thank you.
[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:50.040]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:55.880]  That's 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:55.880 --> 02:53:56.880]  That's OneWorld.
[02:53:56.880 --> 02:53:57.880]  W-H-E-Y.com.
[02:53:57.880 --> 02:53:58.880]  All right.
[02:53:58.880 --> 02:54:08.200]  We'll have to do overdrive because all your calls.
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:09.200]  Next up is Habub.
[02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:11.400]  Then we're going to talk to Anthony.
[02:54:11.400 --> 02:54:14.760]  Then we're going to talk to Bruce and others.
[02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:17.720]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:17.720 --> 02:54:20.200]  Pray for peace with this Russia situation.
[02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:23.800]  Both our countries are run by pretty corrupt folks.
[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:27.840]  But Russia is not starting this and our media is trying to whip something up and it's very
[02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:31.400]  dangerous with Putin now threatening the hell we got nuclear weapons.
[02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:33.520]  Knock it off.
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:37.720]  And we had former top CIA analyst Ronald Reagan and George Robert Walker Bush's favorite
[02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:43.600]  briefer, favorite briefer, that's in mainstream news, telling you exactly what I'm telling
[02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:44.600]  you.
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:48.600]  I mean, there's no other way to slice this how dangerous it is, how out of control it
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:49.600]  is.
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:52.880]  I mean, and again, I don't like what happens to the Palestinians on many fronts.
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:54.960]  It's a very sad situation.
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:59.400]  I don't like what happens, you know, as well to innocent Israelis because I don't hate
[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:00.400]  them.
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:01.800]  I don't hate either side.
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:04.920]  I am concerned about nuclear war.
[02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:11.720]  I am concerned about the globalist funding radical Islam to demonize mainline Islam to
[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:16.960]  then basically bully Muslims into either joining radical ranks or being killed.
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:21.120]  And that's being done so the globalist can then wage war against all those countries.
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:24.000]  It's such an evil plan, such an evil setup.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.080]  Habu in Wisconsin, thanks for holding.
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:27.720]  Apologize, Reven, you hold that long.
[02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:28.720]  What's on your mind?
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:35.640]  No, apologies from you, but thank you all the same for the opportunity.
[02:55:35.640 --> 02:55:37.880]  Just three quick points.
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:47.840]  One about Ukraine, your perception is correct that Russia is beginning to harden its stands.
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:55.880]  This statement combined with the food convoys, they went into Ukraine, didn't wait for their
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:56:05.520]  permission after waiting for such a long time, and also from news accounts from outside the
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:13.640]  mainstream media I'd heard recently this week that some of the separatists had routed Ukrainian
[02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:14.640]  troops.
[02:56:14.640 --> 02:56:16.720]  Yeah, that's now admitted.
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:18.880]  That was coming out two weeks ago, but wasn't confirmed.
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:20.880]  It's now admitted.
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:30.520]  Good, it's about time that Kiev gets a bloody nose, and the whole notion of what Putin said
[02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:37.880]  about, yes, we are nuclear armed, Russia has been very measured in what it has said.
[02:56:37.880 --> 02:56:46.200]  Unlike Washington, which has gone on blathering its rhetoric, but so often we've heard American
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:52.440]  presidents, and as I remember from Bush 41, with that familiar refrain, all options are
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:53.440]  on the table.
[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:59.680]  It's the same thing, but Russia has said it in a very diplomatic way.
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:08.400]  The second thing is the ISIS thing, this is also part of the whole meant to create more
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:16.000]  confusion in the minds of people, and a suggestion to you, and you brought him on, I wish you'd
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:24.080]  bring General Hamid Gul of ISI, because he would have very keen insights into the Pakistani
[02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:25.080]  people.
[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:29.600]  I agree, let's try to ask General Gul to come on sometime next week, it's just the middle
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:33.800]  of the night over there where we're on, so offer the general for us to tape it later
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:39.880]  in the day so he can be in the morning, but we should get him on.
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:46.640]  And the last part is that I think that there is a really concerted effort by the West,
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:55.320]  I believe in this case, to gin up the rhetoric, whether it's in Ukraine or ISIS, and now with
[02:57:55.320 --> 02:58:04.920]  Britain going on the stereo alert, it's just to really put people into a frenzy of fear.
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:11.080]  I haven't seen an occasion like this where so many even educated people are so confused
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:18.720]  about the goings on, Ukraine was on the right side, but especially in Iraq, Syria.
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:23.520]  This is what a disinformation campaign looks like, where everything's just so confused,
[02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:29.000]  fog of war, the globalists are planning something big, you can see them moving on all fronts,
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:34.600]  it's like they don't care what we know, I got a bad feeling folks, I hear you Habu,
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:35.600]  it's serious.
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:40.600]  We'll be back with a few more calls, stay with us, infowars.com, this Sunday, 4-6pm,
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:45.800]  want to thank all our affiliates, God bless you all, thank you for your prayers, this ends
[02:58:45.800 --> 02:58:51.080]  the official transmission, we'll do some overdrive in a moment.
[02:58:51.080 --> 02:58:57.080]  In the near future, when you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball, security,
[02:58:57.080 --> 02:59:03.320]  alert, this is Homeland Security, analysis, info wars, building independence, media operation.
[02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:08.760]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:11.520]  Prime Directed, discredit Alex Jones.
[02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:16.480]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory, a popular conspiracy theory talk show called
[02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:17.480]  Info Wars.
[02:59:17.480 --> 02:59:19.480]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:25.000]  These people are assaulting us, targeting of patriots engaged, they are never going
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:29.880]  to stop, they're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[02:59:29.880 --> 02:59:44.840]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out,
[02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:50.880]  intellectually it's for God you can fail it.
[02:59:50.880 --> 03:00:10.600]  Postic Coast, Direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:17.680]  Fix Bayonets, we are now entering overdrive, with your host, Alex Jones Broadcasting Live
[03:00:17.680 --> 03:00:23.320]  from the front lines, if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:28.080]  I did part two with Paul Watson, appreciate him working so hard on it, I just gave him
[03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:32.560]  some of the ideas and you came up with some of them, but 10 more conspiracy theories that
[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:38.680]  came true, from a fascist coup d'etat of the FBI poisoning, alcohol, I'm going to cover
[03:00:38.680 --> 03:00:44.080]  all 20 conspiracies that came true this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. on the Sunday transmission, unless
[03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:48.120]  all Hades broke loose in Russia, we'll see, we've got some special guests coming up Sunday
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:49.120]  as well.
[03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:53.160]  Right now let's jam in some more calls, thanks for holding Anthony in Florida, you're on
[03:00:53.160 --> 03:00:54.160]  the air.
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:55.160]  Hello?
[03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:56.160]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:01:01.640]  Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, I'd just like to say that I completely agree with you that I think
[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:07.320]  that Vladimir Putin is not dumb, and that he knows exactly what's going on with this,
[03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:13.160]  and these people want to financially plunder the Ukraine like they did Greece, and he's
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:20.280]  not going to let that happen, and essentially these people are so misguided that they're
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:24.080]  more than willing to pull the temple down on our heads, you know, when it comes to nuclear
[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:25.080]  war.
[03:01:25.080 --> 03:01:28.520]  Yeah, and they're trying to steal Russia's pipelines that sell cheap gas to Europe, I
[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:34.480]  mean, it's literal piracy, it is, there's a pitch battle going on for oil fields and
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:39.720]  equipment right now, and it's just amazing to watch this happening, and the elite we
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:45.960]  have are looting our bank accounts with Obamacare and open borders, we're all being looted,
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:49.560]  it's bankers, it's not even the U.S. government, it's a bunch of crazy people.
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:57.040]  Earlier before, I think we have literally splintered into real America and then VC America.
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:05.120]  That's right, I agree with you, it's just, and these globalists don't get any trouble
[03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:08.760]  because they all have plausible deniability, it's a big bureaucracy, so there's not even
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:13.560]  anything driving the ship is what's scary, it's like a big blob that just eats everything
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:18.280]  in its path, and now it's so used to eating everything, it's run into Russia with nukes
[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:23.960]  and it's just going, give me all of mine, and it's not that Russia's perfect either,
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:31.400]  it's just that this giant blob has now run up against a Byzantine caveman empire that
[03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:36.560]  isn't going to back down, and it's just like crazy, but that's where these blobs go to
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:44.280]  die, Hitler, Napoleon, they just always want to go destroy Russia, and I guess you know
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:48.520]  you've got to be for Hitler, you're not patriotic, I mean you've got to be against Russia, that's
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:53.080]  what's patriotic, I appreciate your call, things sarcastic folks when I say you need
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:02:59.920]  to support Hitler, you're not patriotic, the point is is that the globalists are acting
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:03.560]  real sneaky right now folks, they're going to pull something big, notice all these shoes
[03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:07.240]  of them dropping, all this crazy stuff that's been happening, when I get up here hysterical
[03:03:07.240 --> 03:03:13.600]  now it's because I'm hysterical, I mean I'm genuinely got spidey sense just pegging,
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:17.960]  I told you that about a year ago, it gets worse every day, everybody I know that's
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:21.920]  on the no is freaked out, if you don't know, hell's already breaking loose or something
[03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:25.360]  wrong with you, I'm sorry to all these other callers, Wayne Andrew Jackson, I don't think
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:30.880]  I'll have time to call for Bruce, Bruce thanks for calling from Michigan, you're on the year,
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:38.080]  you're right to be worried, I'm surprised that Russia has been so patient compared to
[03:03:38.080 --> 03:03:44.160]  Ossetia, that war in 08 only lasted, it was less than a month, they've stretched this
[03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:48.920]  out to six months now in eastern Ukraine, I wanted to recommend an article to you on
[03:03:48.920 --> 03:03:54.880]  lurockwell.com, I was looking for another Paul Craig Roberts and they didn't have him
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:04:01.040]  last night but they had a guy I had never read before named Clive Mond, M-A-U-N-D-S,
[03:04:01.040 --> 03:04:04.200]  sure what's the name of the article, that's the best way to find it, I think it's like
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:10.880]  can Russia survive the empire's onslaught and he gives very good reasons why they will
[03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:18.480]  survive both economic sanctions and the cultural destabilization, it's like he has maps and
[03:04:18.480 --> 03:04:24.240]  charts that are very interesting, he says the great fear in the west is that the dollar
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:31.200]  will lose its reserve currency status and they're going to do anything to keep it and
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:35.680]  that means war with Russia, so either, but if you really look at it, messing with Russia
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:40.960]  is driving everybody out of the dollar, our future will be a great depression again or
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:44.800]  a world war three, it's a very good article, wow okay I'm going to read it because that
[03:04:44.800 --> 03:04:48.240]  sounds accurate to me but I want to see the perspective of the charts, I don't just look
[03:04:48.240 --> 03:04:53.360]  at media that reaffirms what I'm thinking but the sky is blue and yeah that's it, it's
[03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:58.320]  great depression or world war three, I choose great depression, alright see you this Sunday,
[03:04:58.320 --> 03:05:24.000]  great job of the crews, sorry the cars.
