[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:34.560]  Texas Alex Jones it is Thursday the 19th day of August 2010 Wayne Madsen with
[00:34.560 --> 00:41.000]  huge breaking news and in-depth year-long investigation coming to its
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.480]  conclusion conclusively documenting that Barack Obama is a creation of the CIA
[00:47.480 --> 00:53.120]  his mother his father most of the rest of his family our intelligence operatives
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.120]  he's clearly funded by the biggest foundations that created the CIA the
[00:58.120 --> 01:03.120]  Ford Foundation and others the Carnegie Endowment to bring in this world
[01:03.120 --> 01:07.920]  government and he's going to be joining us to go over his three-part series he
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.640]  sent us the third part yesterday we posted all three parts last night at
[01:12.640 --> 01:18.760]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com the headline on the story is bombshell
[01:18.760 --> 01:29.080]  Barack Obama conclusively outed as CIA creation so that is up on the websites
[01:29.080 --> 01:36.640]  right now at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com we're going to be
[01:36.640 --> 01:40.640]  breaking all of that down with Wayne Madsen coming up in the second hour
[01:40.640 --> 01:47.840]  today in the third hour we're going to be talking to Joel Scalson it's probably
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.760]  been five or six years since I've had Joel here on the radio broadcast and of
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.600]  course he is a prolific researcher an investigator of the New World Order an
[01:57.600 --> 02:03.640]  author and of course some of his family have published the book one of the best
[02:03.640 --> 02:07.520]  known books out there exposing the New World Order so we'll be we'll be talking
[02:07.520 --> 02:13.120]  to Joel Scalson about some of his intel that mirrors our investigations dealing
[02:13.120 --> 02:16.560]  with the dark side of the police the dark side of the military how they're
[02:16.560 --> 02:21.200]  being turned into a private intelligence agency system and a gulag
[02:21.200 --> 02:28.120]  archipelago of surveillance and camps and and militarization of police is being
[02:28.120 --> 02:37.680]  developed so that is all coming up today something I want to hit on first
[02:37.680 --> 02:47.160]  though deals with the fact that no criminal charges for school that spied
[02:47.160 --> 02:55.200]  on kids tens of thousands of times through their laptops and remember that
[02:55.200 --> 02:58.520]  first they denied they'd done it then they admit they did it and that the
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.480]  laptops that are federally funded and issued have have this security system
[03:03.480 --> 03:07.360]  on it where the public schools can access the laptops that they say are
[03:07.360 --> 03:11.400]  free but you pay for it with tax money when your child is at home in the
[03:11.400 --> 03:16.920]  bathroom in their bed they took photos of them screenshots of the video of them
[03:16.920 --> 03:22.320]  sleeping in their beds getting dressed you name it and and the school was so
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.360]  arrogant when dealing with all of this that they said what's the big deal and
[03:27.360 --> 03:32.080]  they tried to actually get children in trouble for taking drugs it turned out
[03:32.080 --> 03:36.840]  that one of the high school students was actually eating skittles but they
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.200]  tried to claim that that was some type of drug and so that's why they were
[03:40.200 --> 03:45.880]  watching them at home I mean this is total and complete big brother on every
[03:45.880 --> 03:51.720]  level of society and now the major car manufacturers are coming out and saying
[03:51.720 --> 03:55.520]  oh yes we're gonna have cameras in all cars in the windshield that watch
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.240]  everything going on in the car and are hooked into embedded cell phones inside
[04:00.240 --> 04:04.880]  the car that wirelessly transmit the video back to the threat fusion centers
[04:04.880 --> 04:10.320]  the emergency centers which themselves are run by top secret USA as the
[04:10.320 --> 04:16.840]  Washington Post called it this entire CIA control grid and then of course you
[04:16.840 --> 04:20.120]  also hear the airline saying they're gonna put embedded cameras in the backs
[04:20.120 --> 04:25.760]  of all the seats that will then be watching what everyone does in the
[04:25.760 --> 04:31.560]  plane individually and audio recording everything they say and putting it
[04:31.560 --> 04:35.880]  through a so-called artificially intelligent computer that will flag
[04:35.880 --> 04:40.440]  them for criminal activity like spanking your child which isn't criminal but
[04:40.440 --> 04:44.240]  they'll still take your child or any business secrets you're discussing
[04:44.240 --> 04:48.520]  that'll be uploaded to NSA and of course sold by the airlines this is all
[04:48.520 --> 04:54.840]  admitted a total surveillance society also it appears we've got a false flag
[04:54.840 --> 04:58.120]  operation being run against info wars dot com we'll talk about it on the other

[08:12.480 --> 08:17.840]  important broadcast lined up for you today this Thursday the 19th day of
[08:17.840 --> 08:23.840]  August 2010 thank you so much for joining us we have Wayne Madsen with key
[08:23.840 --> 08:30.720]  information joining us in the second hour he has gotten into publicly
[08:30.720 --> 08:37.240]  available data but he doesn't want to say exactly where because they may shut
[08:37.240 --> 08:43.080]  down the source of the data though he's published the actual information about
[08:43.080 --> 08:50.640]  the true providence of Barack H. Obama that's his fake name Barry Setaro and
[08:50.640 --> 08:56.480]  here's the headline bombshell Barack Obama conclusively outed as CIA
[08:56.480 --> 09:01.920]  creation and he's published part one part two and part three in the last three
[09:01.920 --> 09:07.840]  days they're all posted together at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com with our
[09:07.840 --> 09:14.280]  preface our breakdown analysis of it but the issue is it's come out that Tony
[09:14.280 --> 09:20.800]  Blair had serious connections to MI5 and MI6 it's come out that many German
[09:20.800 --> 09:25.480]  leaders that have been put into power in Germany were basically funded and
[09:25.480 --> 09:32.200]  promoted by US and British intelligence in the last 30 years if you go back to
[09:32.200 --> 09:36.640]  the Milner group and the British intelligence is declassified funding
[09:36.640 --> 09:41.720]  Adolf Hitler when he was just a young member of the German Socialist Workers
[09:41.720 --> 09:47.840]  Party the National Socialist Workers Party the Nazis they groomed and put
[09:47.840 --> 09:53.000]  these individuals into power just like they groomed at the age of 18 young
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.120]  Army officer Saddam Hussein that's declassified in 1958 they trained him
[09:59.120 --> 10:03.720]  for three years in Egypt and they sent him in to carry out assassinations and
[10:03.720 --> 10:10.720]  they helped stage coups to get Saddam Hussein into power in 1979 they do this
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.440]  over and over again and they normally then betray their minions but you know
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.240]  about Bush senior and the CIA memos that have now been declassified that he was
[10:20.240 --> 10:28.920]  part of the CIA by 1950 right out of college after World War two and that he
[10:28.920 --> 10:33.560]  was involved in secret operations worldwide he then magically became the
[10:33.560 --> 10:38.600]  director of the CIA in the 70s claiming he'd never been involved in it we know
[10:38.600 --> 10:43.080]  that George W is intimately involved with the CIA through his father and so the
[10:43.080 --> 10:51.720]  fact that Obama his stepfather his father his mother all clearly working
[10:51.720 --> 10:59.080]  with US and British intelligence he is a wholly owned subsidiary of this at
[10:59.080 --> 11:03.720]  every level and this shows how this illegal corporate shadow government
[11:03.720 --> 11:07.000]  has taken over our society we'll be talking about it with Wayne Madsen but
[11:07.000 --> 11:11.520]  if you look at the British East India Company and others and again this is ABC
[11:11.520 --> 11:16.680]  News this is admitted mainline history they created the Skull and Bone Society
[11:16.680 --> 11:24.680]  in 1832 at Yale to go recruit who would become the future robber barons the
[11:24.680 --> 11:31.160]  Carnegie's the Tafts future presidents future CIA directors secretary of
[11:31.160 --> 11:35.680]  states the list goes on and on and they went in for the British Empire to try
[11:35.680 --> 11:39.040]  to retake the United States and they set up the Council on Foreign Relations in
[11:39.040 --> 11:44.440]  1922 openly as a British intel arm of the Royal Institute of International
[11:44.440 --> 11:48.920]  Affairs and Cecil Rhodes system they simultaneously were getting Hitler
[11:48.920 --> 11:53.560]  groomed for power to later tear up Europe so they have a pretext to come in
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.760]  as the good guys of course it's come out that the US and British government in
[11:57.760 --> 12:06.880]  1917 saw the October Revolution and sent 30,000 US operatives mainly out of
[12:06.880 --> 12:11.720]  Brooklyn this is all on record over there to take control of the Revolution
[12:11.720 --> 12:16.920]  our government created the Soviet Union on record our government created
[12:16.920 --> 12:20.960]  Mao Zedong now declassified the old-timers always said that they'd
[12:20.960 --> 12:25.680]  witnessed it in 49 but now it's been declassified CIA section chief admitted
[12:25.680 --> 12:30.120]  eight years ago on the history channel that they put Mao Zedong into power and
[12:30.120 --> 12:35.160]  David Rockefeller of course had bragged about it publicly in 1976 in his
[12:35.160 --> 12:39.000]  editorial in the New York Times admitting world government that they put
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.640]  Mao Zedong into power and how great communism is and how he hopes to have it
[12:42.640 --> 12:47.360]  here in the United States we went to the microfilm at UT shot the video of it
[12:47.360 --> 12:53.840]  our great researchers did and put it together in the film in-game blueprint
[12:53.840 --> 12:57.280]  for global enslavement they want tyranny look at how our criminal
[12:57.280 --> 13:02.000]  government everywhere puts right-wing fascist left-wing communist
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.040]  authoritarians warlords in power in every country they can two years ago
[13:09.040 --> 13:12.840]  Zbigniew Brzezinski published a second book we already knew this but he
[13:12.840 --> 13:18.800]  published a book bragging that he helped engineer putting Pol Pot into power
[13:18.800 --> 13:24.680]  and was very proud of the 30% of the population being killed very proud of
[13:24.680 --> 13:28.600]  that Zbigniew Brzezinski and you can pull up Zbigniew Brzezinski admits he
[13:28.600 --> 13:33.240]  funded Pol Pot or Zbigniew Brzezinski you know says he funded Khmer Rouge you
[13:33.240 --> 13:38.240]  can pull up his disgusting sickening quotes you can go to the bookstore and
[13:38.240 --> 13:42.440]  buy his stinking books and you can read him bragging about it he bragged back
[13:42.440 --> 13:47.080]  in the 70s he bragged in the 80s now he's gone completely public with it and
[13:47.080 --> 13:52.400]  it goes on and on if you think you're safe from these people if you think they
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.320]  care about the United States if you think they won't line you up and shoot
[13:56.320 --> 13:59.120]  you and throw you in a hole if they can get away with it you're gravely
[13:59.120 --> 14:05.920]  mistaken it's about pure ultra aggression ultra dominance ultra control
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.720]  that they are just brutally about mechanized armies and secret police and
[14:10.720 --> 14:17.520]  controlled revolution and total tyranny that is what they are for that is what
[14:17.520 --> 14:24.520]  they stand for they are cold-blooded brutal murderers who are all about total
[14:24.520 --> 14:31.200]  dominance and they control our presidents they control it all and that's
[14:31.200 --> 14:36.080]  why they're so scared if you look at political funding now it's almost all
[14:36.080 --> 14:41.880]  shifting away from the federal government to the state governments and the
[14:41.880 --> 14:46.880]  governor's councils as the globalist realized that the states can checkmate
[14:46.880 --> 14:52.400]  because the founding fathers built this in through the 9th 10th amendment they
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.200]  can checkmate the the the feds that have been seized by this corporate
[14:56.200 --> 15:03.280]  government and so they are moving in to do several things how did the British
[15:03.280 --> 15:08.760]  keep control of Kenya they went and founded militias and trained and armed
[15:08.760 --> 15:13.400]  them this is declassified in the 40s and 50s had them attack peaceful people in
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.200]  the cities and the peaceful people bought the British then coming in and
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.600]  waging a war not realizing that their protectors were funding the enemy as
[15:21.600 --> 15:27.280]  well I mean even children's movies have this plot it's so popular in history
[15:27.280 --> 15:34.560]  like revenge of the Sith part three of Star Wars by by by episode three even
[15:34.560 --> 15:39.320]  children could figure out the plot this senator funds an attack on his own
[15:39.320 --> 15:44.880]  planet covertly then out of the attack he gets more power and becomes the
[15:44.880 --> 15:50.080]  chancellor of the galactic Senate because the galactic Senate failed to act he
[15:50.080 --> 15:55.120]  becomes very popular then he stages foreign armies to attack that he's
[15:55.120 --> 16:01.200]  funding covertly the core system the capital planet and out of that he gets
[16:01.200 --> 16:07.920]  martial law and becomes the emperor it's very simple for you to understand and
[16:07.920 --> 16:12.600]  now they're trying to find militias I'm for the militia in the bill of rights
[16:12.600 --> 16:16.080]  and Constitution the Co and tell pro will spend it and say because they're
[16:16.080 --> 16:20.240]  operatives many of them that I'm bashing militia no I'm not and they'll
[16:20.240 --> 16:23.320]  misrepresent what I'm saying now because they're operatives you can catch a
[16:23.320 --> 16:29.040]  minute and find out who the operatives are I'm saying the militia is good but
[16:29.040 --> 16:34.640]  they are radicalizing it and are running many of them and creating groups to then
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.040]  be blamed for staged events in the future so they can roll out their
[16:39.040 --> 16:44.360]  strategic police state grid against the states where we are going to peaceably
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.320]  take the states back and take the republic back they're going to come in
[16:48.320 --> 16:53.200]  and stir up conflict and stage terror attacks and say Muslims did it our fine
[16:53.200 --> 16:58.400]  weak-minded people who are Muslims and open doors forum and protect them I mean
[16:58.400 --> 17:06.440]  I had a former top CIA analyst Mick Michael on who was part of the you know
[17:06.440 --> 17:10.520]  national security assessment group it doesn't get any more high level than
[17:10.520 --> 17:15.800]  that two days ago telling you yes our government may have staged 9-11 and
[17:15.800 --> 17:19.000]  yes they do stage terror attacks and he's worried about staged events what
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.600]  is Ray McGovern chief refer to Ronald Reagan George Bush senior what did he
[17:23.600 --> 17:27.760]  tell you they stage events what did hameed ghoul former head of Pakistani
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.720]  intelligence say they stage the events because the evidence is that is what's
[17:32.720 --> 17:37.600]  happening and going on so you better believe this is an unpopular criminal
[17:37.600 --> 17:42.280]  offshore corporate group that wraps their tyranny in the American flag they
[17:42.280 --> 17:45.640]  do not care about this country they want to bring it down they want to
[17:45.640 --> 17:49.920]  privatize everything into their own police state and the biggest card they've
[17:49.920 --> 17:54.640]  got to play is World War three domestic stage terror attacks to be blamed on
[17:54.640 --> 18:00.720]  white al-Qaeda that's anybody that owns a gun and loves private property you got
[18:00.720 --> 18:05.160]  a portrait of John Wayne on your wall your white al-Qaeda and of course lci
[18:05.160 --> 18:10.160]  aida al-Qaeda you are the target of this and people in the state police people in
[18:10.160 --> 18:15.960]  the CIA FBI this whole apparatus top-secret USA the it's well over a
[18:15.960 --> 18:19.120]  million the news says eight hundred fifty four thousand private spies with
[18:19.120 --> 18:24.000]  the highest security clearances you're all compartmentalized and very few of

[18:27.560 --> 18:32.160]  on little power trips but this isn't a game you're playing you're going to help
[18:32.160 --> 18:36.600]  the bankers do what they did in Soviet Russia in communist China in Nazi
[18:36.600 --> 18:43.680]  Germany in East Germany in pole potty in Cambodia you're you're about me it's
[18:43.680 --> 18:50.000]  on record the CIA put Fidel Castro in but then in plan to destroy him and failed
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.600]  but they admittedly gave him funding up front and then he double crossed them
[18:54.600 --> 18:57.840]  and that's why they hate him so much just like Iran had been under their
[18:57.840 --> 19:01.480]  control repeatedly and then got kicked out so they think it's theirs they think
[19:01.480 --> 19:05.600]  they own you they think they own the Cubans they think they own the Iranians
[19:05.600 --> 19:09.320]  they think they own everybody is that saying Fidel's good no he's bad that's
[19:09.320 --> 19:13.200]  saying the Iranian leadership's good no they're pretty screwed up but the point
[19:13.200 --> 19:19.520]  is they're not the big mega British style mind control empire and they're
[19:19.520 --> 19:22.600]  gonna pull out every dirty trick in the book you've seen them dress up like

[24:39.440 --> 24:44.640]  hide hidden cameras and catch them so it's known that more often than not these
[24:44.640 --> 24:49.920]  are staged events and of course we have seen the federal government infiltrate
[24:49.920 --> 24:54.760]  militias radicalize them try to get them to do illegal things the Hattari have
[24:54.760 --> 24:58.880]  now been released you know the judge has said this looks like a complete
[24:58.880 --> 25:04.240]  provocateur operation in Michigan seven months before they got set up I said it
[25:04.240 --> 25:07.800]  looked like they were being set up from what I saw in their online videos it
[25:07.800 --> 25:11.160]  looked like it was produced to set them up we know two of the nine members were
[25:11.160 --> 25:15.080]  feds and so they've shut down that investigation basically because they
[25:15.080 --> 25:19.000]  don't want us to find out who howl Turner calling for violence attacking
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.440]  myself and others all these years trying to radicalize the movement against
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.120]  tyranny so it's unpalable to people to now come out he was highest level
[25:27.120 --> 25:33.040]  national security asset that's Reuters Chicago Tribune you name it they've
[25:33.040 --> 25:36.400]  caught people go into Rand Paul events and many other events and organizing
[25:36.400 --> 25:41.600]  nationally against tea parties saying racist things doing racist things for
[25:41.600 --> 25:47.920]  the Democratic Party this is how they operate and it's very effective to hang
[25:47.920 --> 25:52.040]  up paper signs in legal areas where folks you know check your local laws as we
[25:52.040 --> 25:57.760]  say it's very legal to do banner hangs it it's good it's it's it's part of the
[25:57.760 --> 26:01.520]  American experience is what the Sons of Liberty did in the decades leading up to
[26:01.520 --> 26:08.160]  1775 1776 and we've told people you know make your own anti-fluoride signs or
[26:08.160 --> 26:13.360]  use ours it's got fluoride facts posted in legal areas to educate people that
[26:13.360 --> 26:18.240]  there is poison in the tap water if your city is fluoridating or your town and a
[26:18.240 --> 26:23.480]  lot of folks have done this and it's made news in Utah and in Kansas and in
[26:23.480 --> 26:30.080]  Missouri and many other areas well now someone in Mill Creek Township in
[26:30.080 --> 26:34.600]  Pennsylvania has spray painted on private property something we defend
[26:34.600 --> 26:43.000]  here garages pickup trucks you name it saying info wars calm and don't drink
[26:43.000 --> 26:49.960]  the fluoride and it's more than a 90% chance this is a provocateur at action
[26:49.960 --> 26:54.680]  probably by Democratic Party operatives or their supporters or the fluoride
[26:54.680 --> 27:03.720]  supporters 10% chance some young you know ignorant mischievous testosterone
[27:03.720 --> 27:09.600]  laden 15 16 year olds did this 10% chance or less I believe this is a
[27:09.600 --> 27:14.280]  provocateur at action Kurt Nemo concurs but we'll continue to watch it spray paint
[27:14.280 --> 27:19.400]  vandals target church homes and cars in Lebanon County political messages written
[27:19.400 --> 27:23.680]  in red spray paint in Mill Creek Township I mean even if they were gonna spray
[27:23.680 --> 27:29.160]  paint cars and I'm not saying they should do this government cars or the
[27:29.160 --> 27:34.920]  courthouse don't do that but I mean if it was activist who were really angry at
[27:34.920 --> 27:38.840]  the government poisoning the water and extreme things you know take extreme
[27:38.840 --> 27:42.480]  actions like I could see people doing that though I think it's bad because a
[27:42.480 --> 27:46.600]  little backfire and taxpayers got to pay to remove it I mean don't do it but to
[27:46.600 --> 27:50.920]  spray paint people's houses and cars this is outrageous and wrong and I
[27:50.920 --> 27:55.120]  believe it's a provocateur at action here is the local newscast out of Mill
[27:55.120 --> 27:59.800]  Creek Township and he spent the day cleaning up a big mess red spray paint
[27:59.800 --> 28:04.800]  covering homes cars and driveways Fox 43 steamy garland has this story from
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.160]  Mill Creek Township to explain how a website is involved with the vandalism
[28:09.160 --> 28:15.320]  why why did you do that you know what what are you gonna gain out of it those
[28:15.320 --> 28:19.440]  are questions many people in Newman's town Lebanon County are asking after
[28:19.440 --> 28:25.560]  finding their property covered in red spray paint alright pause back it up to
[28:25.560 --> 28:28.760]  the start again we'll come back and play the rest of it did you hear that how a
[28:28.760 --> 28:35.120]  website is involved the implication is I mean if somebody went out and sprayed
[28:35.120 --> 28:40.960]  Coca-Cola or somebody went and sprayed NASA on people's private property would
[28:40.960 --> 28:45.920]  it be NASA or Coca-Cola's fault we have always called for not messing with
[28:45.920 --> 28:50.960]  private property and hanging little paper signs in legal areas where folks
[28:50.960 --> 28:55.760]  are already hanging signs that that is in the posting we put up and everybody
[28:55.760 --> 29:01.160]  knows that and so now this has been done let's go out to break with it from the
[29:01.160 --> 29:04.840]  start again here it is in County community spent the day cleaning up a big
[29:04.840 --> 29:10.840]  mess red spray paint covering homes cars and driveways Fox 43 steamy garland has
[29:10.840 --> 29:15.040]  this story from Mill Creek Township to explain how a website is involved with

[29:21.320 --> 29:25.720]  of it those are questions many people in Newman's town Lebanon County are asking

[29:30.720 --> 29:35.800]  this morning and I started seeing graffiti on different buildings and on

[29:41.280 --> 29:46.320]  Street the words send a specific message that some might call conspiracy

[33:14.000 --> 33:23.280]  network frame ups frame ups are as old as civilization and humanity itself
[33:23.280 --> 33:29.240]  remember the lady when a few days before the election who got caught carving a
[33:29.240 --> 33:37.120]  swastika on her face and the police noticed that the well it wasn't a
[33:37.120 --> 33:43.560]  swastika it was a letter B and the police noticed that it was backwards for
[33:43.560 --> 33:47.400]  Barack Obama and then she later admitted that she'd done it and other people
[33:47.400 --> 33:51.800]  been caught I was thinking about swastikas because so many groups have been
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.600]  caught painting swastikas on their own churches or synagogues or dorm buildings
[33:56.600 --> 34:02.680]  for sympathy I mean there's been so many cases of this over and over again and I've
[34:02.680 --> 34:07.960]  noticed they always do it to make it look real haphazard and almost misspelled
[34:07.960 --> 34:14.920]  or jumbled it's like the anthrax letters that were all written strange and
[34:14.920 --> 34:19.360]  misspelled and then the FBI said that it wasn't weaponized anthrax it was
[34:19.360 --> 34:24.400]  garden variety and it turned out it was a US government super strain previously
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.280]  unknown that was so advanced it would take hundreds and hundreds of millions
[34:28.280 --> 34:33.720]  of dollars of equipment just to miniaturize it and then they tried to
[34:33.720 --> 34:37.320]  charge three different people with it and set them up and finally they grabbed a
[34:37.320 --> 34:44.000]  worker and he committed suicide in their custody so he couldn't fight back and
[34:44.000 --> 34:50.080]  speak out against them there's there's so many cases of this and looking at this
[34:50.080 --> 34:56.040]  I really think that this is probably somebody doing this to make info wars
[34:56.040 --> 35:02.040]  dot com look bad we certainly know that we check our messages here every day
[35:02.040 --> 35:04.560]  we've gotten better and better about it and I haven't been contacted by this
[35:04.560 --> 35:10.320]  news station if they're just up there implying that how is a website involved
[35:10.320 --> 35:16.440]  implying that I'm telling people to go spray paint info wars dot com on people's
[35:16.440 --> 35:20.440]  private property I don't even say spray painted on government buildings I have
[35:20.440 --> 35:26.800]  repeatedly said don't do anything illegal number one it's illegal number two
[35:26.800 --> 35:33.680]  it makes us look bad less than a 10% chance this was teenage kids who are
[35:33.680 --> 35:37.760]  dumbered in a box of rocks but why wouldn't they go to the courthouse why
[35:37.760 --> 35:42.520]  wouldn't they do it to police cars which they shouldn't do so we've got the
[35:42.520 --> 35:47.400]  woman carving you know Barack Obama on herself and being caught to blame it on
[35:47.400 --> 35:51.080]  black people saying the two black males did it to her we've got black groups caught
[35:51.080 --> 35:54.520]  doing it saying whites did it to him Jewish groups caught doing it I mean
[35:54.520 --> 35:59.480]  this is just ongoing and it's a microcosm of what intelligence agencies do
[35:59.480 --> 36:04.600]  what what individuals do and in smaller groups do governments do but on a
[36:04.600 --> 36:09.680]  grander scale so here's the rest of this newscast that's demonizing us so we're
[36:09.680 --> 36:14.760]  playing in here to analyze it and defend ourselves here it is this morning and I
[36:14.760 --> 36:20.200]  started seeing graffiti on different buildings and concrete graffiti found
[36:20.200 --> 36:25.880]  over a two-block area along an alley behind West Main Street the words send a
[36:25.880 --> 36:31.360]  specific message that some might call conspiracy theories no fluoride in water
[36:31.360 --> 36:37.040]  vaccines poison souls learn the truth just a few of the phrases written in red
[36:37.040 --> 36:43.200]  along with a website address info wars.com the website is Alex Jones info
[36:43.200 --> 36:47.560]  wars.com because there is a war on for your mind you can see one of the
[36:47.560 --> 36:51.800]  featured articles is about fluoride and water and also under sections there's
[36:51.800 --> 36:57.280]  one called Big Brother. The message they were pervading didn't seem to me that
[36:57.280 --> 37:01.240]  it need to be displayed on somebody's property. I know my garage is not in a
[37:01.240 --> 37:07.880]  very good shape but you still didn't have to do it. Find another way to change
[37:07.880 --> 37:16.880]  your venue this is not the way to go about it well that's just incredible
[37:16.880 --> 37:23.400]  that's where the clip cuts off that's just incredible they imply there's no
[37:23.400 --> 37:27.520]  the way to see that that my website has done it and oh look it does have a
[37:27.520 --> 37:31.640]  message about fluoride and they didn't tell you that when you click on that it
[37:31.640 --> 37:38.240]  shows a PDF flyer we made that says there's poison in the tap water please
[37:38.240 --> 37:43.160]  post this flyer only in legal and lawful areas are handed out to your friends and
[37:43.160 --> 37:48.920]  family here are some fluoride facts and then we tell you that the union of EPA
[37:48.920 --> 37:54.480]  scientists have come out and said that fluoride is deadly poison and increasing
[37:54.480 --> 38:00.240]  cancer I mean that's my ride as an American and it's very effective to put
[38:00.240 --> 38:04.600]  these up in legal and lawful areas and to give them to people it is ineffective
[38:04.600 --> 38:11.000]  and horrible to go around spray painting this on people's houses and cars and I
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.760]  think it's a staged event and the way that newscast did that I mean look what
[38:15.760 --> 38:20.440]  happened with the Pittsburgh situation within two hours of Richard Poplowski
[38:20.440 --> 38:24.160]  shooting those three cops because his mother was trying to kick him out of the
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.920]  house because his pit bulls were soiling her carpet the media said he did it
[38:28.920 --> 38:33.440]  because of me then we searched his name there he was on dozens of websites
[38:33.440 --> 38:38.640]  including mine attacking me because I'm against violence and they said in the
[38:38.640 --> 38:43.680]  news and I forced retractions in five different papers that I got him to do it
[38:43.680 --> 38:49.800]  and they're telling cops that I'm telling people to go out and kill them a
[38:49.800 --> 38:55.960]  national news story within two hours and they're claiming he did it for me with
[38:55.960 --> 39:01.320]  no evidence and they had to retract and now this has happened in the same area
[39:01.320 --> 39:08.640]  the same region I believe this is as staged as the other events and it just
[39:08.640 --> 39:12.400]  shows you the type of dirty tricks we're facing and God knows more of this is
[39:12.400 --> 39:17.400]  going to happen so pray for us and don't let them stop your activism post
[39:17.400 --> 39:22.680]  flyers in legal places give them to people post them at work post them in
[39:22.680 --> 39:27.360]  other areas we're under common law you see other signs for garage sales or you
[39:27.360 --> 39:32.160]  know I saw I was driving through town and saw a Walgreens sign out on the side
[39:32.160 --> 39:39.360]  of the road stuck in the medium which under I think under state law you're
[39:39.360 --> 39:42.440]  supposed to do can be on the side of the road but not in the middle so so don't
[39:42.440 --> 39:45.760]  even do what Walgreens does or what the what their worker did don't stick it in
[39:45.760 --> 39:49.080]  the middle of the road stick it on the side legal awful areas you want to blow
[39:49.080 --> 39:53.720]  up the flyer you know make make political yard signs out of it with
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.680]  the with a stake you know that's your right to do it and it'll have a big
[39:57.680 --> 40:04.000]  effect and get people talking but I saw this sign you know get your flu shot
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.120]  after they've already suspended the flu shots months ago and admitted they're
[40:08.120 --> 40:13.560]  causing a tenfold increase in seizures and Guillain beret especially in under
[40:13.560 --> 40:19.360]  five-year-olds so it's okay for Walgreens to put their take your flu
[40:19.360 --> 40:25.760]  shot signs up off their property I saw this out by Lakeway and outside Austin
[40:25.760 --> 40:30.240]  this weekend it's okay for politicians to put their signs up I saw a story
[40:30.240 --> 40:35.280]  yesterday where there's a community ordinance in a town and in fact guys
[40:35.280 --> 40:38.640]  reprinted for me I know it was in the stack but I'll never find it where the
[40:38.640 --> 40:42.640]  guy had a Gadsden flag and you're allowed to fly flags football flags
[40:42.640 --> 40:47.920]  American flags your state flag but they're saying well we're not gonna let
[40:47.920 --> 40:53.240]  you have a Gadsden flag because it's a tea party flag it's a bad flag that's
[40:53.240 --> 41:01.200]  like Facebook Facebook running around taking down websites that have the
[41:01.200 --> 41:06.280]  Gadsden flag they are afraid of this information so because they're
[41:06.280 --> 41:10.840]  counter striking with these type of provocateur actions we need all of you
[41:10.840 --> 41:14.360]  to do what others have already done and gotten a lot of news attention and cause
[41:14.360 --> 41:18.920]  big debates in towns all over the country you and in Canada and England
[41:18.920 --> 41:22.920]  other places where they're fluoridating we need to do this as well go make your
[41:22.920 --> 41:29.120]  own fluoride sign or take our flyer and blow it up or alter it and and and make
[41:29.120 --> 41:36.160]  yard signs out of it and legally and lawfully and tastefully get these out
[41:36.160 --> 41:42.560]  to everyone immediately it's having a big effect and I have no doubt that this
[41:42.560 --> 41:49.880]  is a provocateur action I hope it's just idiots because that's a lot less scary
[41:49.880 --> 41:53.040]  than thinking that the establishment's doing this but you know they've already
[41:53.040 --> 41:57.080]  done it to me so many times they've already been caught so many times they're
[41:57.080 --> 42:01.600]  already saying I want people to kill cops when it's the opposite I've said we
[42:01.600 --> 42:05.360]  need to educate the police and military they're already trying to blame me for
[42:05.360 --> 42:08.960]  dead cops they're already trying to say Rand Paul's kidnapping women and now I
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.520]  admittedly it's a total hoax I mean what's next I mean are they gonna claim I
[42:13.520 --> 42:16.720]  killed Kennedy or that I sunk the Lusitania or that I blew up the
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.440]  Hindenburg or that I killed Jesus I mean no I didn't do any of that and I
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.120]  didn't kill those cops and I didn't tell anybody to kill those cops and Rand Paul
[42:25.120 --> 42:30.160]  didn't kidnap a woman and make her do drugs she admits that's not true I tell
[42:30.160 --> 42:36.040]  you it just gets crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute I've got a bunch
[42:36.040 --> 42:42.000]  of economic news I want to go over with the stock market has dropped over 180
[42:42.000 --> 42:50.360]  points on weekly job claims post-surprise jump hit 500,000 and they're now
[42:50.360 --> 42:53.640]  admitting okay it may not just be a double-dip recession it may be a full
[42:53.640 --> 42:57.920]  board depression the answer is give the Federal Reserve that engineered this
[42:57.920 --> 43:04.640]  crisis even more power so that's coming up but before I go any further we are
[43:04.640 --> 43:11.400]  offering specials until Monday that will end just like you could buy one copy the

[43:48.120 --> 43:52.120]  continue to survive as things get darker and darker because as things get
[43:52.120 --> 43:56.840]  worse and worse more people are listening to us and paying attention to

[47:42.720 --> 47:47.440]  shambles that our revenue has planed out is even going down a bit and so we're
[47:47.440 --> 47:51.240]  in quite a pickle because it cost a lot to serve all this bandwidth and to make

[49:45.320 --> 49:48.640]  says claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week in the
[49:48.640 --> 49:52.720]  Federal Reserve of Philadelphia said manufacturing activity in the mid

[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.360]  publicly available databases we'll leave it at that but he doesn't want him to
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:02.400]  close down these sources the sources if the information itself is public and
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.080]  verified it's just that where Wayne's getting this because they've been very
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.680]  secretive about clamping down his college records high school records
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.960]  passport birth certificate all of this Wayne doesn't want him to shut down the
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.560]  source of this because he's digging through it right now and finding even
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.360]  more and is a schedule to go down there again today I'll just leave it at that
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:29.080]  but the story of Obama all in the company in three parts we've got it linked
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.080]  up at info wars.com we've got the blurb written above it with some of the
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.480]  history of other presidents being intelligence assets bombshell Barack
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.640]  Obama conclusively outed as CIA creation and I've seen a lot of this info open
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.680]  source before but Wayne's put it all together in one spot and found a lot of
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.600]  new data and it's got to be a 25-page report but I suggest you read it all but
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.120]  but here he is to go over it with us in the next 45 minutes to 50 minutes and to
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.040]  give us some new intel he's gotten you can find it all and new developments and
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:07.520]  Wayne Madsen report.com and we have it linked up at info wars.com he's getting
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.280]  so much traffic it's barely staying up this morning it's off and on that's why
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.880]  we've got this key report we're thankful for him letting us mirror it at info
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.440]  wars.com Wayne congratulations on your in-depth investigation you've been in
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.520]  Chicago for weeks you've been all over the country investigating this guy and
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.400]  you've gotten some powerful info oh thanks but I feel so much aggrieved I
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.720]  think all this information is what should have come out during the the
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.000]  presidential campaign not on a certain president in the United States and I
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.320]  really think that myself and other members of the media I you know I'm not
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:46.840]  counting the corporate media they never touch these stories but we really were
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:53.560]  remiss I think in in delving into this guy's past during the campaign which is
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.720]  what we've done with every other previous presidential candidate and for
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:03.040]  some reason I guess we all got hooked on the hope him with Obama well Bush was
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.600]  so bad I don't blame people for wanting to get hooked on the hope him but I saw
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:12.320]  his advisors and Wall Street doubling down on him I knew McCain was bad but
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.400]  clearly he was the establishment's heir apparent and so that's why I saw
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.440]  through him oh absolutely and now we hear today that one of the Kagan boys has
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:25.960]  been hired on as an advisor to General Petraeus so what's the difference you
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:30.720]  know we had Obama speaking at the CIA headquarters telling them you know how
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:35.200]  much he appreciates what they do and don't don't worry about the
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:39.880]  investigations you know you worry should have been taking him for what they did
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.680]  during the renditioning in the secret prisons and and now we know about the
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.880]  the latest one in Morocco where we turn people over to have tortured by the
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:55.320]  Moroccan secret police so I mean this is the guy that keeps on giving is as
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:00.240]  long as you're you know CIA or the Pentagon and and I don't see any change
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.120]  as a matter of fact in some respects I think he's worse well Wayne Wayne I
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.800]  have to agree with you unfortunately because he brought left cover to this
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.920]  and a fresh face and he's a better teleprompter reader a lot of people went
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.800]  to sleep over the secret arrest the expanding wars the torture America
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.920]  really losing its soul and he's been protecting John you and of course
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.240]  Alberta Gonzalez and Bush and Bush feel so safe two months ago he said yeah I
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:32.640]  ordered torture I do it again oh absolutely and and his Justice Department
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:40.120]  is going after Plagojevich again after all he got was a single counter flying
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:44.340]  to an FBI agent and he wasn't even under oath there's no even there's no
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:49.680]  transcript he'd like to lay off on the Abrams deal I mean this is I mean he's
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.200]  the gift that keeps on giving for the last people in the last administration

[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.880]  investigative journalist Wayne Madsen is scheduled to appear live on this
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:31.520]  broadcast he's here now Thursday August 19th at 12 central to reveal his
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.560]  groundbreaking series on Barack Obama's true origins Madsen will share the
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.920]  bombshell revelations and extensive information from the following three

[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:55.520]  subscribe and I mean this guy formerly worked for the NSA Naval Intelligence
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.200]  he's written for some of the biggest publications in the country Washington
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:04.000]  Post you name it he's a contributor to RT he's a real patriot his info is
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.600]  always borne out to be very accurate he told me where he got this new
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:12.400]  information and he's it's verified and confirmed it's just that there's been a
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.520]  I don't want to go any further because they keep clamping down every time they
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.120]  learn of a new place people are getting information but we're gonna stop right
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.520]  there and Wayne can say as much as he wants but this is all public source and
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.880]  verified as three articles but you need to read all three parts the story of
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:36.160]  Obama all in the company part one part two and part three at info wars.com or
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.840]  Wade Madsen report.com and again his site is weighed down so if you can't get it
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.440]  there info wars.com and get it out to everyone you know because I have
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.440]  separately researched this in depth making the Obama deception and fall the
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.480]  Republic and a lot of this was already public but a lot of it is new and just
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.760]  completes the image of what we've got now before we go back to Wayne I want to
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.760]  show people a few new stories that came out this week here's Politico don't look
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:11.200]  Berthers it's Obama's passport as if his passport means something now this came
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.160]  out on the heels of them shredding and destroying his mother's passport which
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.360]  would be stamped where he was at what time when he was born the evidence shows
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.800]  in Kenya but we know he gave up a citizenship and became Barry Sotaro
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:30.720]  like Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader he became Barry Sotaro and gave up
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.720]  his US citizenship that is confirmed that's mainstream news okay and they
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.160]  try to abscond that evidence by only focusing on Kenya I'm not bashing those
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:46.040]  that do it just this is smoking gun now here it is oops Obama mama passport
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:50.960]  destroyed State Department claims records gone for Stanley and Dunham prior to
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:59.120]  1968 around the time that old Barack Obama was born in 1961 continuing
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.160]  White House offers glimpse of President Obama's passport documents shows
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.320]  birthplaces of why so they they're they're desperate they won't put out the
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:13.940]  original passport just a receipt of it okay just just a slip not the real
[01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:19.800]  passport and now they're doing this at the same time they destroyed her passport
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.680]  very very suspicious so I wanted to just point out they've been involved in a
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:29.000]  cover-up Wayne Madsen go over your groundbreaking report the new stuff
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.800]  you've discovered and other things you haven't put in part one or part two or
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:38.440]  part three you've got the floor Wayne Madsen go over it well I started this
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:43.560]  investigation by looking at the company that President Obama went to work for
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:48.040]  after he graduated from Columbia and it was Business International Corporation
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.040]  and that was a company that had close ties to the CIA they use some of their
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:12:00.480]  quote-unquote journalists at CIA cover officers overseas now in his book
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.160]  Obama's says I want to work for a company in Manhattan after I graduated
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.600]  from Columbia Columbia but it was the company the CIA it wasn't a company and
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:15.960]  now he was very disingenuous with talk about talking about that this was a
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:21.600]  company that had access to some of the biggest the most powerful people in the
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:28.040]  world including Soviet Premier Alexei Kosigan Generalissimo Franco of Spain
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:33.520]  and it obviously this company did outreach to a lot of leftist leaders in
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.120]  places like Africa and Asia and other other parts of the world including
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.880]  Latin America and and then I started looking at of course his mother and
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:49.080]  her prime in Indonesia especially but also Pakistan it turns out she was
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:54.120]  working not only for the Ford Foundation on micro financing projects I I have
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:59.480]  information at the states of one of the CIA economic officers at the U.S.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:03.440]  Embassy in Jakarta worked on the same exact project while she was there
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:09.880]  financing micro financing of love for these farmers and artisans and central
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:18.240]  Java now she Obama's a and Dunham to Toro takes her son at seven years old into
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.840]  Indonesia following the CIA inspired coup two years later
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:29.040]  learning to Toro's stepfather was clad back by General Suharto from Hawaii where
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:37.680]  he met Obama's mother in 65 but prior to the CIA coup and he went to work at four
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:44.440]  of the Suharto's army now that they killed an estimated up to one million
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:50.440]  Indonesian citizens a lot of that big Chinese and also reported members of
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:55.000]  the Indonesian Communist Party so this is the environment she takes seven year
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.560]  old Barack Obama I mean what who in the right mind would do that unless you were
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:06.360]  you know being assigned to work for the agency in those days I also looked at
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.560]  Barack Obama senior now he was airlifted it was called project Africa
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:16.200]  airlift Africa it was funded by a $100,000 grant from the Joseph P. Kennedy
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.160]  Foundation but that's because Tom Amboy who was a Kenyan national leader pro-
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:26.320]  US tied in with the CIA decided he didn't want to take State Department money
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.000]  because that would look too suspicious so that looks like they laundered some of
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.320]  this money through the through the Joseph P. Kennedy Foundation in 1960 now
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.080]  remember John Kennedy's running for president then so that's building up
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:44.560]  his national security credentials helping out the agency and the reasons
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.240]  for bringing these 230 students from Kenya, Tanganyika and others soon to be
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.120]  independent British colonies in eastern and southern Africa was to compete with
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.560]  the Soviets and Chinese who were training their own leaders in these in
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:05.880]  these newly independent nations and it was clearly to gain influence with these
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.640]  new government just interrupt briefly the bottom line historically is the
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.880]  British of the masters of this but other governments have done it that's why
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:18.480]  you had to be American born to be president in the Constitution because
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.840]  at the time our country was being founded they had problems with the
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:27.360]  Austrians sending their people into other European countries during the
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.720]  democratic revolutions that were developing to try to put their people
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.600]  into power there and so this story of intelligence agencies prepositioning
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.200]  people to put them into political power so they control nations is extremely
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:45.240]  old and we also know that Kenya in the 40s and 50s into the 60s was the
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:51.400]  admitted declassified global model of covert takeovers and was the main base
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:56.800]  of operations aside from South Africa and Rhodesia for control of the African
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:02.480]  continent well right and we have to remember the same year the same year
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.280]  that Barack Obama senior was brought over in the CIA airlift Africa project is
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:12.200]  the same year that the Soviet Union opened the Patrice women's university in
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.680]  Moscow for this for the whole purpose of training people from not these third
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.920]  world nations that he's newly independent countries so this petition we
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.280]  of course didn't have a Patrice women's university but we parroted these students
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.280]  among various universities around the United States and Barack Obama senior
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:37.200]  was the first African student to attend the University of Hawaii and meets Obama's
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:44.400]  mother in where your phone was cutting out a bit he meets his mother again
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.200]  Barack Obama senior meets meets mama and of course her daddy you're going to
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:53.480]  get into has connections to the agency he meets her where in a Russian
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.720]  language class at the University of Hawaii now this is the height of the
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:03.000]  Cold War and the other people who would be taking Russian in a place like Hawaii
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.140]  which was like a military I mean the military was all over Hawaii the Navy
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:11.280]  the Army the Air Force would be obviously people who were involved in
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.120]  some way shape or form with intelligence or were being recruited into
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:26.720]  intelligence and now the grandfathered there's a photo of him welcoming
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.480]  Barack Obama senior to the airport in Hawaii now we were told that they met
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.280]  for the first time at the Russian language class it's clear now this
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:41.240]  furniture salesman we were told Stanley Armored down a grandfather it was in
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.080]  the furniture business it seems like he was in much much more than just
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:51.080]  selling furniture incredible and then of course you have her then being
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.240]  projected into the big foundation under Tim Geithner's father I mean just on
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.320]  every side you've got all these connections in the report and then he's
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:04.840]  got a fake name he's changing his name we don't know where he's born he comes
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:08.200]  from nowhere to become president I mean it just I mean the evidence is
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:14.040]  overwhelming well then we have we have a curious case of his grandmother of
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:20.560]  Madeline Dunham who died right two days before Obama was elected president in
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:25.480]  2008 the Obama campaign apparently didn't want her giving any interviews for
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:30.040]  the press maybe they were afraid should be like Newt Gingrich's mother with the
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.880]  Katie Couric interview and slip up and say something that would have embarrassed
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.320]  them but she was one of the first female vice president at the Bank of Hawaii and
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:43.320]  now along the hall we find out that that bank was used by the CIA front company
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:47.960]  and in Honolulu to make payments for these dictators in Asia likes to hard
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:53.480]  out and Marcos in the Philippines and generalist emotion Kai-shek in Taiwan
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:58.600]  and the Park Chung-hee in South Korea and the little Democrats in Japan who
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.560]  violated their own constitution by secretly allowing the US to station
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.680]  nuclear weapons in Japan during the Cold War so so this was the payoff this was
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:13.600]  the CIA payoff network to these US sponsored dictators in Asia we're gonna
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.560]  go to Brighton come back and keep going through your article that really puts
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.960]  all the pieces together that clearly this guy's an intelligence operative we'll
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:26.240]  look at once he's in college how he sent to Pakistan clearly in all sorts of
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:31.600]  secret ops I mean this is extremely clear but also if you really study deep
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.280]  intelligence it's normally a family affair because then the whole family's
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:41.240]  connected there's the peer pressure of the family you can never leave and so we
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.760]  see that pattern throughout history at the highest levels of intelligence we'll
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:50.520]  continue to look at a Barry Sataro aka Barack Obama the president on the other
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.840]  side of this quick break with Wayne Madsen you've got to read the report look

[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:09.360]  4491 okay we're talking to Wayne Madsen who was a top security expert at the
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.080]  national security agency naval intelligence whenever you watch c-span
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.240]  and you're seeing an intelligence committee hearing you'll see him in the
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.520]  gallery is a press reporter he's written for literally scores of top
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:26.080]  newspapers and publications here in the country and so a very you know top
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.120]  level a source an investigative journalist Wayne Madsen report comm has
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:34.480]  it all bottom line before we go through more of the history more of the evidence
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:41.920]  of this what type of asset is Obama what was their plan because he was nested at
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.360]  the highest level both sides of his family at the biggest foundations that
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.800]  themselves created the CIA the way I read this in my past research it appears
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:58.360]  that from very early he was put into the highest level schools being developed
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:03.560]  for where he is now and anyone who remembers the movie the Manchurian
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:08.760]  candidate that's exactly what they were trying to do with in that movie
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:15.320]  setting somebody up but in this case it was it looks like it was the CIA had
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.840]  their own Manchurian candidate and groomed this individual for higher
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:27.240]  office and he eventually got it now one of the things that I found was some
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:36.080]  CIA files from the 1970s referring to behavioral science work being done by
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.440]  the Central Intelligence Agency and one of the universities and this comes from
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.480]  Richard Helms the director himself one of the favorite universities for
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:49.040]  behavioral science work and let's face it that was out of the office of
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.360]  science and technology that's MK ultra that was Dr. Sidney Gottlieb's
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.160]  operation one of the favorite universities for this research was the
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:04.000]  University of Hawaii where Barack senior met met and family Dunham and so
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:09.120]  you're saying he was trained in mind control or he's under mind control well
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:13.640]  I I don't you know I don't know but I mean and we know what MK ultra was it
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:18.400]  was it was it was extreme behavioral modification yeah the LA Times reported
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:22.920]  the Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski was in that program well another another
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:26.000]  university you know some of the other universities mentioned in this were Yale
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.440]  MIT University of Michigan and UCLA and and the University of Hawaii is single
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.520]  out of the fifth favorite university for this work by Richard Helms now this
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.480]  work was done through the advanced research project agency which was
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.680]  working the guy Lieutenant Colonel Kibler with US Army was working on things
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.520]  like remote viewing you know that you saw the movie Men Who Stare It Goes that
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:55.760]  was what that was all about so it was a multi-faceted project that have a but
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.280]  it was all done for this weird bizarro stuff well for me what you know the
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.320]  cherry on top and we haven't covered a 10% of the evidence in your article is
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:09.200]  that the way they hide all his records the way he goes right into college but
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.440]  it's never there he's all over the world he's in hot zones it looks like they
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:19.280]  were training him in all sorts of you know in the field training from a very
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:25.560]  early age well the CIA front company and in Honolulu actually came up with a
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:30.120]  fast corporate history so that it they have been doing business in Hawaii since
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.360]  it was a territory everything was faked with that particular company when when
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:38.800]  the company went bust and accused of being a Ponzi scheme where we heard that
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:44.240]  recently certainly we had with Stanford we had we heard it with Enron and here
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.640]  we had another one and DCCI so here we have an early example the CIA setting
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.200]  up this financial firm to make these payoffs out of Honolulu and when it
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.240]  goes bust the innocent the investors will be brought in grandma's running it
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.480]  well she's working at the bank of Hawaii which is wandering the money she's
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.880]  running the expo account at the bank of Hawaii which is the money is whether the
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:15.360]  agency is placing the funds to transfer to their their boys over in Asia
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:21.360]  these dictators and these favored favorite politicians I would also note
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:27.760]  that AIG which he bailed out which was started by Ken Starr's great uncle when
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:35.240]  in Shanghai was also a CIA front doing the same thing in Asia from China to
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:39.360]  Japan to Korea and everywhere else well look what top secret USA confirms what
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:44.160]  you'd already reported on for years close to a million secret private spies in
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:49.320]  the US alone with the highest security level that's one out of 300 Americans
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:54.080]  absolutely so you know we look at we look at all this and and it's
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:29:00.360]  fascinating I I also found a very rare copy of a book that was written in
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:05.200]  1968 actually favorably reviewed reviewed in an article in the Boston
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:13.680]  Globe in 1971 and it was 3000 CIA agents around the world with the the
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:20.000]  stations and some of the most active were Jakarta and and the whole Pakistan
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.600]  and Karachi and the book list a bunch of Obama's family's bosses bosses right
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.640]  including the guy that was right and running them the microfinancing work
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:35.200]  out of the US Embassy in Jakarta at the time so we have a lot of a lot of
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.960]  connections I also noticed that one person who I know is listed in the book
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.960]  Peter Ernest who runs now the International Spy Museum here in
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.640]  Washington stay there stay there I want to go over all of it when we come back
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:56.000]  and what it means we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:23.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:28.160]  dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding

[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.720]  just leave it at that a lot of things are newly declassified on a routine
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.960]  basis they do everything they can to cover up his history now they shred his
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:57.640]  mother's passport that would be stamped for where she really was when he was
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:04.720]  born and then release his passport which he's already had a passport before
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.200]  even if he got it through fraud that's easy to do this proves nothing but it's
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.880]  their attempt to say look we're not going to give you the original you know

[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.840]  the birthers and you've got this entire history of being groomed the entire
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.800]  family on every side deep inside the big foundations working for Geithner's dad
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:37.760]  the Rockefellers Annenberg all of them you know all the top globalist and then
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.840]  you've got even more in this three-part series well you know we go back to
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:49.880]  January February of 08 and the big US State Department passport scandal
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:55.400]  where some contractors working for a company called the analysis corporation
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:01.120]  were caught looking into Obama's passport files now that company at the time
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.560]  was headed by Don Brennan who used to be with the CIA came up with a lot of this
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.680]  rendition program under Bush and now he's the deputy national security advisor
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:17.360]  how convenient so you know they said all Hillary and McCain's passports records
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:21.520]  were being looked at I think that was a diversion that was that was you know make
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.440]  it look like they were going at all and I think the fact is they were going in to
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:32.040]  see exactly what Obama had if anything with the smoking gun as far as his
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:36.920]  passport files and I was getting ready to say before the break that one of the
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:42.840]  names in this book of 3,000 active agents during the late 50s and 60s is
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.400]  Peter Ernest who's now the director of the International Spy Museum and
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:52.040]  remember Obama took his two daughters to the spy museum everyone said now isn't
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.120]  that a little odd why would he take them there well maybe it was all home week
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:03.720]  for him so what does this mean to the American people Wayne to to have someone
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:08.120]  who who clearly was manufactured and put into power I mean obviously they can
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:12.000]  blackmailing but that's not even needed he's just completely controlled what I
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.720]  think that's the problem he should look presidents and vice presidents to our
[01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.800]  senators or members of the house do not require security clearances the mere
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:26.600]  factor elected their staffs require the clearances but they do not but that
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:32.040]  that job pass to the press to vet these people and the media fail miserably
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:38.400]  during that campaign on what I reported out of Chicago with his private life
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:43.080]  and now with this his background with the agency this should have all this was
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:50.240]  all available back in nine in 2008 and and no one you know pursued it because
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:55.120]  everybody was listening to this brilliant order and you know beware beware
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:59.120]  these brilliant orders history is replete with them and it turned out to be
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:03.800]  nothing more than demagogues when they've gotten into office we know many
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:09.560]  cases of it throughout throughout recent and even ancient history where that
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.720]  happened continuing there's a lot of other areas of your detailed three-part
[01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:19.720]  series that we haven't covered yet I kind of recap it get into some other
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:23.480]  areas and connections we didn't go over and then when we talked last night you
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.320]  said you're still doing more research there's even more that there's mountains
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:34.720]  of this and just every place you turn CIA CIA CIA CIA well let's look at his
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.560]  father his father Barack senior who was brought over in his airlift Africa project
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:46.480]  now his mentor in Kenya who was assassinated in 1969 Tom and Boya
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:52.800]  basically selected Barack senior and others over more qualified candidates
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:58.800]  and I've got a not very obscure Reuters piece from London in 1960 where one of
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.320]  the opposition leaders in Kenya says wait a minute some of the people who were
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.880]  passed over had better academic qualifications better certificates than
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.880]  the people who were selected well it's obvious why they were selected they
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:15.360]  were selected and in case of a Obama senior he married with a kid and went
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:19.520]  on the way already in Kenya when he arrives in Hawaii and he marries
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:26.960]  Obama's mother who's just graduated from from a high school it's very clear
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.600]  that this was some sort of a CIA operation to get those two together you
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:36.920]  know you got to wonder what kind of parent would you know put their their
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:43.040]  own child up for auction for it because the agency finds it it's important to
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:48.960]  do so but it's interesting because he basically was spying for the CIA at all
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:53.400]  these pan-African meetings and basically he was trying to limit the
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.720]  influence of some of that leftist African leaders who were thought to be in
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:03.120]  the pocket of the Soviet Union and and communist China at the time and
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:09.640]  particularly Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana who was also overthrown in 1966 in a CIA
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:14.880]  coup just one year after Sukarno was overthrown in Indonesia with the help
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.960]  of Lolo Satoro, Iraq's stepfather and whatever work his mother was doing for
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:29.000]  USAID and and other entities in Indonesia. Now we talked last night and
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.280]  I said it seems to me that they knew that they would build him up as this
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:42.720]  messianic leader and then they study societal movements, individual psychology,
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:48.560]  mass psychology, the architects know that he would then not deliver the
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.080]  milken honey and the restored economy and the end of torture, the end of wars
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:59.000]  with his advisors and who put him in power they were always planning to you
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.560]  know not deliver any of his promises and then politically destroy him and you
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.720]  concurred with me so I want you to expand on your view what was their plan
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:16.040]  for Barry Satoro aka Barack Obama and and and what is their master plan in
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:21.840]  compass for the nation and and and and for their front puppet. More
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:29.760]  Balkanization, more division, selling Africa on AFRICOM or AFRICON being set
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:36.600]  up. I mean what's the overall program with plan Obama? Well you know the CIA
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:42.160]  regularly uses people who are called futurists. Now this is a weird kind of
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:47.720]  thing where people look at it. These are these are a subject area experts who
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:52.560]  try to look to see where technology, where politics, where population, where
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.840]  demographics will be 20, 30 years into the future. And they seek to steer it. They
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:00.000]  seek to already know what people are going to want to do, where culture is
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.200]  going to bring them so they can be prepositioned to dominate those systems.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:08.880]  That's what Google is. So if we go back in time to 1960, we're looking at the CIA
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.480]  looking at the demographic changes of the United States, increasing African
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:19.040]  American population. I don't think they really banked on the increase in the
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:23.760]  Hispanic population. Obviously that came later. Well wait a minute it's come out
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.560]  that the Ford Foundation billions, Bill and Linda Gates, tens of millions, two
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.160]  matcha and la Raza, Ford Foundation going back 60 years creating those groups.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:37.600]  Right. Well I think the one thing because of the civil rights movement, they
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:42.480]  were looking at, like Martin Luther King was the leader of the African American
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:49.800]  group movement, the people in this country. He broke with Johnson in 67 over Vietnam,
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.520]  steered very hard to the left, and as the CIA I am sure said, God we can't, if we're
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:58.800]  going to get a leader, we can't have a Malcolm X, we can't have a Martin Luther
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:04.080]  King Jr. We have to make sure that when we have one, and in line to become
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:09.320]  president, somebody that we can basically control. Let me back you up, Margaret
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:15.760]  Singer in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s on record in public letters with the
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.280]  Rockefeller Foundation saying we've got to pose as liberals, get the black leaders
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:24.320]  in place so we can abort most of them, and they've been successful. 51% of blacks
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.720]  never make it out of utero, they're murdered in the womb. So they did that
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:33.920]  and they talk about controlling black leaders by financing them, so we know
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:38.040]  that that's their strategic plan. And Martin Luther King got off the
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:46.560]  reservation, so they took him out. Absolutely, and so you look back in 1960
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:51.880]  and is it beyond the pale to consider the fact that they may have wanted to
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:57.960]  groom somebody from a very early age like a baby? You know, you've got his
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:02.240]  parents and his grandparents basically in their pockets, and then you've got this
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.480]  stuff about behavioral science work at the University of Hawaii. There's just so
[01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:15.000]  many gaps in the histories of not only the president, but also his mother, his
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:21.120]  father, his grandfather, and his grandmother on his mother's side. So
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:26.680]  when you see gaps like that, now you just look at any other president. Those
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:32.400]  families, we knew way too much. My god, Roger Clinton, Billy Carter, but in this
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:36.600]  case we have these significant gaps in their histories, and I think that's
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:40.560]  something that people should be concerned about. Wayne, I think that's the key
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.720]  that you just hit on. You have all this effort to cover up the past. You've got
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:49.960]  CIA connections to your left, your right, forward, and backwards at every level.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:56.400]  You have got the fact that they've spent so much time not just in the present, but
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:01.960]  going back decades covering up his true providence and where he comes from.
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.680]  And then as you said, all these intelligence and corporate intelligence
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:11.160]  and foundation connections, and now he's the president, and we know they have
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.680]  these programs to go in not just here but all over the world and recruit leaders.
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:20.280]  I mean, the British recruited Hitler, that's declassified, in the mid-20s and
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.920]  took him from nowhere and funded the national socialists to make him their
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:28.640]  leader, and the Milner group bragged, we're gonna build this guy up and he's
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.360]  gonna tear Europe up, and then we're gonna be able to come in and rebuild it and
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:36.560]  take it over. I mean, this is their long-term strategic thinking, and when
[01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:41.880]  you look at Obama and everything he's done, it's clear this guy is a total
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:46.320]  betrayer of everything he claims to be. Well, you remember last November when
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:53.280]  Old Man Bush, HW41, and Jeff Bush paid what was called a courtesy call to the
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:57.640]  White House? We were not even told what that was about, a courtesy call. That's
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:02.560]  all we were told. Well, you know, you've got the guy who the CIA headquarters
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:08.480]  named after and his son visiting Obama, and it's just all we were in town, we
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.680]  thought we'd stop by, look, that doesn't happen at the White House. I mean, those
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:17.320]  the law he's assigned, you don't get into the White House unless you have a reason
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:24.280]  to be there. So, I mean, obviously you're saying their plan was to have a
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:27.960]  controlled asset who was supposedly African-American in there, that's clear,
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:33.560]  but how is their plan going? I mean, did they mean for him to be a Messianic
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:40.160]  leader and be successful, and has their attempted launch of this African-American
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:46.000]  Napoleon failed, or did they plan to just use him as a distraction and then
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.720]  destroy him? Well, I think he's given them everything they want. Look, Operation
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:55.080]  Iraqi Freedom is now Operation New Dawn. I mean, right out of George Orwell's
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:46:00.360]  new speak, Lexicon, we're showing pictures of convoys leaving Iraq. 50,000
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.160]  troops are going to stay and we're going to see an increase in contractors.
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:06.720]  What's that all about? By the way, I have the New York Times today on that. They say,
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:11.880]  oh, private contractors and intelligence operatives will now run the
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:16.400]  government. So, this is a practice run for the U.S. and other countries where
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.800]  they don't just stage coups. They come in and put in their entire apparatus
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:24.960]  through these giant armored embassies and control everything and just have
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:29.840]  plain clothes, death squads running the nation. Well, that's right, and look with
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.000]  Obama, the right after he comes in, he allows the CIA to overthrow President
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  Delay and Honduras. He wants to build seven military bases in Colombia and the
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.120]  constitutional court of Colombia just shot that down. So, what Obama wants to do
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:47.440]  is now being shot down by the court in Colombia. I mean, this guy is
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:51.400]  owned, locked, stocked, and barreled by these intelligence, the
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:57.340]  intelligence community, because he's not said no to them ever. I mean, Patriot
[01:46:57.340 --> 01:47:03.360]  Act, still in effect. We have an increase in electronic surveillance. We got
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:08.400]  these people through the CIA and Google and NSA and Google and
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:14.840]  Microsoft and everything else. So, he's allowed, he ran out on openness. The
[01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:20.000]  Freedom of Information Act is still not being implemented. It's still backlog,
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:26.600]  requests are not being honored. So, I mean, everything he ran on, he has lied on
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.720]  very fundamental constitutional issues, and we were told that he taught
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:34.040]  constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School. I don't know which
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.160]  law he was teaching, because when you look at his actions, it looks like he's
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.880]  teaching the Constitution of North Korea, not in the United States of America.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:46.360]  You know, I laugh, but it isn't funny. This is really happening, and I mean, this
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:50.400]  is really the private offshore corporate takeover of society. They're setting up
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.480]  their fusion centers run by the CIA in every major city. They're federalizing
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:00.240]  the police. They're training U.S. SWAT teams in Iraq for cordon, for shutting
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:05.680]  down cities, for gun confiscations. At the G-20 in Pittsburgh, my employee got
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:10.840]  arrested. Rob Do, he saw people being let off trucks with bags on their heads. The
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:15.120]  Army would then, when they had to go to the bathroom, to follow them and then make
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:20.240]  fun of them, and this was all encouraged, like something right out of 1984.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:25.560]  And they had private snatch and grab teams in front of news cameras on purpose,
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.800]  grabbing activists, putting bags on their heads. Now it happened in Toronto, same
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:35.680]  thing in England. They are globally deploying a scientifically developed
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:42.680]  corporate oppression, a corporate black-op tyranny, and I mean, clearly this
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:47.200]  is the complete shadow takeover, and now it's out in the open. I mean, this is so
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.080]  illegal, Wayne. Well, let me say another thing about Obama. You know, he has had
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:57.560]  scheduled two trips to visit Indonesia. Both trips have been postponed. You know,
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:04.000]  I think he knows that when he arrives in Jakarta, the Indonesian press, some
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.160]  foreign press will start looking at his time there, and I don't think they want
[01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:13.280]  that kind of attention on that, and I think that's one reason. Now he's always
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.760]  said he's had other priorities. I think the oil spill was one reason. Well, no,
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:20.480]  that's another issue, Wayne. He keep bringing up great points. It's admitted
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:24.360]  he was in Indonesia longer than he said. Then he lied about being in the Muslim
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:28.200]  School. It's fine if he's a Muslim, but why lie about it? I mean, everything he's
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:32.680]  ever told us is a lie. You went over that earlier. I mean, when the parents met,
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:36.840]  when the grandparents met, when all this happened, we learned it's all a fiction.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:41.560]  Well, the other thing I discovered is when they were, before they went to Hawaii,
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:47.240]  they were in Mercer Island, Seattle, in the state of Washington, and I did find
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:53.880]  in a list of these agents, CIA people, the name of the chief engineer for
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:50:01.040]  Boeing, and he was, his area of primary assignment was Mercer Island. Now, Madeline
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:04.560]  Dunham worked for the Boeing Corporation during World War II, in which he
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:10.320]  talked. So, he's the only guy listed with the agency in Mercer Island. You know,
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:16.160]  we got to figure the timeframe here. You know, you could conspiracy or
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.400]  coincidence, but I think that's much more than a coincidence. But we know his
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:26.160]  father's involved in all these secretive activities. Now Obama's involved with
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.960]  Odinga, having the Muslims riot to create the prime ministership for him. I mean,
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:37.360]  just everything Obama does is dastardly. Everything he does is skull-duggery
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:44.280]  laced, and it's just at every turn, and then there's the secrecy. And so, I think
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:48.680]  you've conclusively proven that the media has been involved in a cover-up of this
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:52.880]  guy's true history, and everything we know about Barry Sataro is a complete
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:56.840]  stinking lie. Final segment straight ahead with Wayne Madsen, WayneMadsenReport.com,
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:00.440]  our site's at GCNLive.com.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:04.480]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.440]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:12.280]  that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:15.680]  gold? It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:19.440]  country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:23.880]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:28.920]  call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:32.640]  dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.480]  not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:41.480]  plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:48.040]  That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:56.400]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:00.360]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:04.600]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind? If it's
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.760]  burky water purification systems, this message is for you. Did you know that
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:13.520]  over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride, at less than 2 cents per gallon?
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:17.880]  Burky water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:21.680]  chlorine fluoride and contaminants from municipal water. These filters are
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.920]  powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater
[01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:29.960]  collection systems. From the smallest to the largest systems, big burky water

[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:04.760]  Attention, this is a special alert to all Americans who owe $10,000 or more in
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.720]  back taxes to the IRS. The IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.400]  people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed. Due to the
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.000]  financial crisis in America, the IRS has announced a leniency plan in
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.480]  recognition of consumers' financial troubles in today's economy. If you owe
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:23.400]  $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, an open phone line has been
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:26.800]  established by American tax settlement for you to call and see if you qualify
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:33.520]  for a reduction by up to 75%. Number to call is 800-902-6969. Again, the IRS is now
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:37.240]  accepting reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:41.200]  to the decline in today's economy. If you are struggling with $10,000 or more in
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:45.040]  back taxes to the IRS, you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:49.440]  to 75% and save thousands of dollars. For free information and to see if you
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:54.840]  qualify, call the open phone line into American tax settlement now 800-902-6969.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:54:18.840]  800-902-6969. Again, 800-902-6969.
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:30.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we haven't done one since Monday. You want me to do it
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:36.160]  again? I appreciate the work you've done. I want people to read Wayne Madsen's
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:41.560]  report and I want them to read the breakdown that we've done on top of it.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.400]  So I want you to search this key term and make it the number one search term
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:51.280]  today. And I'm going to launch another one next hour. We'll hit them with two
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:55.640]  torpedoes, but the article isn't ready at PrismPlanet.com separately on what
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:59.760]  Google's doing, trying to take over the web with Verizon. So that'll be launched
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:03.920]  at 30 after we're Joel Scalson next hour. But I want you to search the term
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:12.600]  Bombshell Barak. Bombshell Barak. Bombshell Barak. And then that will
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:19.880]  lead them to WayneMadsenReport.com. Search the term Bombshell Barak right now,
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:23.920]  and that will lead them to this investigation. We'll post these videos
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:29.200]  later at YouTube. We'll link those in. And Rudge Report routinely then links to
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:33.920]  this, and we can push this mega viral thanks to you taking action. We'll expose
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:42.080]  the CIA created asset. Bombshell Barak is the search term. Bombshell. One word.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:49.320]  B-O-M-B-S-H-E-L-L Barak. Please take action. We're 10 for 10. We've done this
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:55.280]  10 times. You have never failed in the Info War. Bombshell Barak. And we're
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:00.080]  going to launch another torpedo in T minus 35 minutes. Closing comments, Wayne
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.200]  Madsen. I hope people will support your investigative journalism by subscribing.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:07.240]  You give most of what you do away for free, but it's important that people
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:10.160]  support you as an investigative journalist. How do they subscribe to
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.120]  WayneMadsenReport.com? Well, you just go to WayneMadsenReport.com.
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:19.880]  M-A-D-S-E-N-F-R-C-O-R-T. All one word.com. And you'll see a thing that says
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:27.920]  join now. Click on that, and it'll step you through the process. But you know, it
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:32.360]  is time-consuming to go through and locate and then go through these
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:38.720]  extensive files because we're talking about kind of ancient history. You know,
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:45.000]  the CIA 1960-61 up through the 70s, and there's a lot that you just have to
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.200]  piece it together. It's a very time-consuming process, but I'm going
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:55.200]  to continue to try to delve into this background because, as I said, this
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:01.400]  should have been done in 08. It wasn't done, but I guess the old saying
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:08.840]  better late than never applies here, too. Well, you certainly deserve respect and
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:12.680]  support, Wayne. We've got about a minute and a half left in this hour. Any other
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:18.080]  key tidbits or points you wanted to make? Well, I noticed that it is a mother's
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:23.360]  passport record. There was a name that had been crossed out to Harko, which is
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:29.000]  yet another name we have in addition to Soutoro. I guess the question is, who
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:34.240]  is Suharko? Who was he? Who was he? Was that another name
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:39.680]  assigned to President Obama when he was in Indonesia? How do you spell
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:50.760]  Suharko? S-O-E-H-A-R-K-O. Very suspicious. Anything else? Well, I would just
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:56.120]  urge people to, you know, while we have the Internet, you know, it's
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:58:01.280]  under tremendous assault by the guys like Cass Unstein and his friends. Just
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:08.760]  to search all this information out so that it may become useful later on
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:12.560]  before it disappears entirely. I agree. They're clearly telegraphing. They're
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.720]  planning to launch false flag attacks on the web, blame it on China or Russia, and
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:21.600]  use it as a way to start controlling it. Absolutely. WayneMadsonReport.com. Wayne
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:24.840]  Madson, thank you for spending an hour with us. Look forward to speaking to you
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:27.800]  in the near future. We'll continue to watch your reports on your great website.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:32.960]  Okay, thank you. You bet. There goes Wayne Madson. Joel Scalcin is coming up on the
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:37.840]  other side in the third hour as we continue to investigate Top Secret USA,

[01:59:51.920 --> 02:00:06.040]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big Brother,
[02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:13.480]  mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:22.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:29.480]  Well, Joel Scalson is a respected researcher, veteran, and he's the editor
[02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:35.400]  of worldaffairsbrief.com, and I was reading an article a few weeks ago when we
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:39.520]  had Chuck Baldwin on Top Secret America the rest of the story, and he quoted a
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:44.600]  lot of key intel developed by Joel Scalson, World Affairs Brief, dealing
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:47.880]  with the dark side of the military and the police, how they're attempting to
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:52.120]  turn them into these secret police oppression squads, and export what they've
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:56.680]  developed in the dungeons overseas and the black sites here to the United
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:01.600]  States, and he's going to talk about that with us in the next hour, but he told
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.280]  me he was listening to the show when Wayne Madsen of the NSA retired was
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:09.960]  really doing an in-depth report. He's gotten even more documents he's about to
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:14.600]  publish, where everybody surrounding Barack Obama, his real name's Barry
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:19.560]  Saturo, is CIA and Rockefeller-type foundation, and he wanted to comment on
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:24.160]  that, and so let's cover that in this short segment, Joel, then we'll get into
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:28.880]  the domestic operations of Top Secret USA. Thanks for joining us.
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:33.960]  Thanks, Alex. It's good to be with you. I'm particularly impressed with your ability to
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.200]  look at the global big picture of things, because I think that's essential.
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:40.960]  That's what you were asking Wayne Madsen when he said, what's the big picture
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.800]  about Obama? What's their purpose in putting in a puppet-controlled person
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:49.400]  who's been with the CIA before? You know, once you've been with the CIA, you're
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:54.120]  really very much controlled. There's very little escaping that route. In a
[02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:58.000]  certain sense, of course, George Bush was a puppet as well, but he was the puppet
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.400]  meant to dupe the Christian conservative right. Obama, you know, there's always
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:06.600]  a reaction. We have to look at this Hegelian conflict. There's always a
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:11.600]  reaction against when a puppet goes in and does it, and then betrays this
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:17.640]  constituency of a big whiplash. So there was a betrayal back to the left. They
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:21.840]  wanted change. They wanted out of the wars of intervention. Barack Obama comes
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:25.960]  forward to present that. I think we have to remember that it isn't that these
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:31.360]  people are the important issue. This is their way of managing the whiplash of
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:37.680]  change when they get, you know, when they try to pretend to be something they
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:42.200]  aren't. There's always a disenfranchisement, a disenfranchampment. They try to ride the
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:46.920]  seesawing as people try to put somebody else in power to fix things. That's
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:50.640]  correct, and they always get certain things done. For example, they got certain
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:53.200]  things done during the Clinton administration. They couldn't have gotten
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:58.000]  done as much as the Republicans under Bush senior betrayed their cause. They
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.200]  can't get certain things done, which they can do under the Democrats. That's why
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:06.360]  you never have any undoing of those agendas when Bush comes in. He didn't
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:10.520]  undo anything that Clinton did. When Obama came in, he didn't undo anything he
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:16.200]  promised that Bush had done, and so you have this pacification of people. I mean,
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:20.720]  you go back even to the Martin Luther King here. I know either you or Wayne
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.240]  said, you know, he had betrayed his people were gone against him. My feeling
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:29.280]  was, in fact, because he was so much involved in prostitutes, it was going to
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:33.360]  get out, just as John F. Kennedy was so much involved in, and there was the
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:38.320]  affairs of the White House, they felt they couldn't maintain, in my
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:43.400]  opinion, the image that he was a reverent to the cause. They decided to
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:48.880]  martyr him to advance and accelerate the agenda, which came because of the
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:52.520]  civil rights movement. No, I agree with you, and I'm concerned that after they
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:56.680]  used up Obama, they could do the same thing to him. They could. In fact, they
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:00.520]  could do this with any number of these puppets. They could accelerate an
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:06.280]  agenda. I happen to think, however, that they're going to present us an
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:11.640]  alternative. They want a Republican in the generation for big war that's coming
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:16.320]  up. My theory indicates that we're going to have a major Third World War coming
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:19.480]  probably at the end of this next decade, and they're going to want a Republican
[02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:24.840]  president in there who's capable of whipping up major patriotic reaction. I
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:31.280]  think they may give, let me put it this way, if they run Sarah Palin, I think
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:34.960]  she's a weak candidate. They've got all kinds of dirt on her that they can bring
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:39.360]  out of when and if they want to destroy her. If they run Sarah Palin for the
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.720]  Republicans, I think they're going to give Barack Obama another four years.

[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:40.680]  fighter pilot for the US Marine Corps during Vietnam air prior to beginning
[02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:46.480]  his design firm specializing in high-security and of course was it
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:49.480]  an uncle that wrote one of the best-selling books exposing the whole
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:54.840]  globalist takeover plan? That's correct. My uncle was W. Clown Scalson who first
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:58.360]  all started out with a very, very excellent historical book called The Naked
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:01.800]  Communist. That was in the days that conservatives thought the communism was
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:08.200]  real problem. He woke up sometime in the 60s and noted that in fact the
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:13.160]  capitalist, which turned out to actually be globalist, not, you know, the real
[02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:16.680]  honest too far or pre-market capitalist, were running the communist and
[02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:21.080]  facilitating them and so he wrote the book The Naked Capitalist, which was a
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:25.320]  blockbuster, started the entire understanding in the world about
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:28.200]  conspiracy theory relative to our own government.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:31.400]  Well that's right and now it's declassified what he wrote about and
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:37.960]  what other investigators in Congress brought out and Anthony Sutton
[02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:40.920]  exposed as well. That's right. That Hitler had been
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:45.480]  funded by the mainly England, that the US had helped put the Bolsheviks in,
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:48.920]  that they helped put Mao in and now that's been declassified
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:53.720]  and that's on the history channel. They create the crisis to offer the solution
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:58.040]  and it's robber barons who want a global, consolidated,
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:02.200]  anti-free market system and now we're coming to the end of the road
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:05.160]  on that and I remember being about 10 years old and I could really start to
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:10.520]  read good that The Naked Communist and The Naked Capitalist were on the book
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:15.240]  shelf at my dad's parents, at my fraternal
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:18.520]  grandparents house and I remember reading part of that book when I was there
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:21.480]  for a week during the summer and that being one of the catalyst
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:24.920]  understanding what was happening then I read Nunn Derek call a conspiracy when
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:28.120]  I was about 14 and then I went out and researched real
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:31.080]  history and found out it was very accurate but for those that just joined
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:35.240]  us getting back into their long-term strategic goal with Obama
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.640]  it's as if they wanted to come in get their agenda through but then
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:43.400]  really anger the public so they go with a fake right-wing candidate
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.840]  as you were saying lining up for world war three.
[02:10:46.840 --> 02:10:50.200]  Please continue with what you see coming in the near future for the United
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:53.640]  States and the world then we'll get into the domestic control grid
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:57.480]  they're putting into place. Well that's exactly right what I was
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:01.080]  heading for is that they always create a reaction
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:05.080]  to these policies the economy cannot be solved
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:08.280]  at least not with Keynesian economics or government controlled interference
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:12.520]  can't be controlled solved with a Fed having fee of monetary powers and so
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:15.720]  they know that eventually they're going to have a backlash against anyone
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:19.080]  who comes in and promises change and success whether it's the war in
[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.440]  Afghanistan the war in Iraq none of that stuff ends up
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:25.800]  nice so in the backlash they're always preparing someone else
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:30.440]  on the opposite side team B as I call it they have team A and team B they control
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:33.880]  both sides and they are setting us up right now
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:38.040]  in the republican side of the specter for this backlash against Obama
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:42.600]  and it's very telling as I point out in my world affairs brief analysis
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:45.800]  if they pick someone like Palin who is extremely vulnerable
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:49.400]  who has you know she's got good charisma they've been giving her a lot of play
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.920]  on on Fox which is the false conservative network in my
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:56.200]  opinion and they're also building up new
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:00.600]  gingrich they're also keeping Mike Huckabee right there and then
[02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:04.200]  in the forefront they're keeping Mike Huckabee on tap
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:09.160]  so that if Mitt Romney a non-conspirator ends up making a big strong play they've
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:12.680]  got a way to to throw him out of the equation
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:16.600]  like they did last election are you saying Mitt Romney's good
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:23.640]  no I'm not I'm saying that he is not a knowing conspirator with the people
[02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:27.560]  they can't afford to let someone as smart as Romney even though he's bending over
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:32.120]  backwards to try to be one of them he isn't and there's a reason for that
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.680]  and that is he's too ambitious he wants to be president those people we never
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:40.920]  trust to be honest conservatives but
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:44.520]  being as smart as he is if he did get into president he'd be like Reagan he'd
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:47.400]  see too much he wants to do what's popular because he
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:50.040]  understand that's he doesn't want to be destroyed
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:53.800]  well that's right but he also you know he does have some principles
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:57.240]  and he they don't have a lot of dirt on it so they can't
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:00.680]  twist his arms now how does Ron Paul play in though because you gave a speech
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:04.120]  a few years ago that I agreed with saying don't go with Mitt Romney go with
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:07.960]  Ron Paul how does the Ron Paul card play into this
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:14.040]  well the Ron Paul Paul card played very strongly in a major episode that
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:19.080]  happened in 2008 or 2007 actually he was responsible in my opinion for the
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:23.080]  entire intelligent estimate that came out and
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:28.440]  said that Iran had dismantled or not gone through with their nuclear program
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:32.360]  they had to have an excuse to get out of their planned attack on Iran because it
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:34.920]  would have accrued to the benefit of the anti-war movement
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:38.280]  and yet an anti-war candidate in the republican
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:42.840]  running for president and so I believe Ron Paul's presence
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:46.280]  stopped them from going through with Iran and now they've switched sides switched
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:50.760]  the intelligent and but Ron Paul is even stronger
[02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:55.720]  now he's been so vindicated he is so much a household name now
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:59.080]  they've got a real problem because he's running for president again
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:02.680]  and so he's going they're going to have to undermine Ron Paul
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:06.440]  with double the support that he had before plus the fact they're going to have to
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:10.920]  work against Mitt Romney who's got a lot of money to put himself back in
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:13.880]  once again as I say it's not that Mitt Romney is
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:17.080]  a trustworthy conservative candidate but he is somebody
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:22.520]  the establishment has to work hard to to make sure he doesn't get into office
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:25.720]  so it's either in my opinion going to be Palin or
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:29.960]  Newt Gingrich Newt Gingrich is also on the other side he's the betrayer he came
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:32.680]  from the left he never was a conservative he's the globalist
[02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:36.920]  he's written books calling for world government in cashless societies
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:40.760]  and I mean this guy wants carbon taxes
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:43.320]  that's right but remember they tried to shove
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:47.560]  Rudolph Giuliani down to conservatives throat in 2008 it didn't fly that's why
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.400]  they had to resurrect McCain with six endorsements right in the middle of the
[02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:54.600]  campaign to get him and they you know it was a disaster but they at least
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:57.480]  got Romney out that's what they wanted to do with McCain
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:01.400]  so that Romney couldn't fill the vacuum by the demise of Rudolph Giuliani
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.400]  Giuliani but in this case they have a true globalist in
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:09.080]  Newt Gingrich which they're trying to float to the American people
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:12.600]  but that's why I say if they end up allowing
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:16.120]  Palin to get the Republican nomination in my opinion it means they're going to
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:19.480]  give Barack Obama another four years now I agree with you I mean she is
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:23.800]  definitely was built up then destroyed now been built back
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:28.760]  up again and they are deploying her to try to take over the Tea Party discredit
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:32.760]  it and throw the election and so if they go with Palin
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:36.600]  we know they're getting ready to throw the election to Barry Sotaro
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:40.520]  I agree completely and if they go with Newt Gingrich then Barack Obama's out
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:43.480]  we're going to get a Republican more longer in there who's going to take us
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:47.720]  to another level now in my long-term analysis I feel
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:52.920]  that the issue is not so much directly Iran and that war is coming
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:56.120]  but that's not going to lead to World War three in my opinion I think that's
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:59.560]  going to lead to a larger regional war that's going to allow Israel to clean
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:03.480]  up and create at the same time an increased hatred in the
[02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:06.520]  world for both the United States and Israel
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:10.440]  will be looked upon as the bullies of the world this plays then into the long
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:14.520]  term globalist agenda of handing Russia and China their final excuse
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:16.840]  to finally take out the bully of the world now
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:21.720]  I think North Korea is being preserved with kids good kid gloves
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.880]  you notice how they never put any real to be used as a future
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:29.480]  detonator this is the future trigger event of World War three
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:32.440]  that's what I think North Korea is being preserved for
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:36.440]  and Iran is only something that will continue to exacerbate the hatred of
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:39.480]  the Muslim world and the Slavic world against the United States
[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:43.080]  and make us look like the bully of the world and it will clean up them
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:46.280]  and control oil assets there's a lot of complexity there
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:51.080]  but let me get back to the ultimate view of how we view this TIA and all of
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:54.840]  this now Wayne Mattson has some very very good analysis he does come
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:59.720]  from a bit of a leftist agenda and so he and other leftists tend to always
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:05.400]  view the evil of capitalism and the CIA as the evil monster which
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:08.680]  has basically done a coup on the United States and taken over the government
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:13.720]  I disagree with that I think that there's a larger conspiracy which is built
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:18.200]  at these globalist leaders well of course I mean the CIA is just one
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:23.080]  deployment cog in the globalist system that's correct the CIA is the
[02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:26.120]  implementer of those things it is not the controller
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:29.640]  and that's what we have to understand this is not a CIA coup these people are
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:32.440]  taking well we know the council on foreign relations takes club of
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:36.360]  rome-builderberg documents and admits that they then write the bills in
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:40.520]  whole whether it's homeland security immigration reform banker bailout
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:44.280]  and word for word it's then passed into law they're openly there writing the
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:49.560]  policy Hillary goes to the CFR and says thank you for giving me my orders
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:53.640]  well it's like James Jones told the Munich security conference February
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:57.800]  hi we at the national security council take our daily marching orders
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:18:01.880]  from Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft and Sandy Berger
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:06.440]  we have a what did he say a hierarchy now this is illegal this is a proof of
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:10.200]  conspiracy Alex as you know and that was published by them in
[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:14.280]  CFR.org and foreign affairs I mean Hillary wasn't joking last year when she
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:17.400]  came and said I'm here thank you for telling me what to do
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:20.680]  and then you got Jones the head of the security council saying
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:24.200]  we have a hierarchy I get my daily briefings for mr Kissinger he runs
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:29.240]  everything and you see that's not legal Henry Kissinger has no legal right to be
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:34.040]  directing it didn't say advise that he said we get our daily marching orders
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:39.400]  that means we're getting orders from someone outside of government that is
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:43.320]  proof of a and why are they so open because they believe setting a precedent
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:46.280]  they openly talk about what they're doing it's like oh we're going to put
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:49.400]  lithium in your water now in the New York Times to make you feel better they
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:54.360]  just take the power of us exposing it away from us by just admitting it
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:57.800]  well you know I'm surprised frankly that they're still up on the website of the
[02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:01.800]  CFR the speech of the Munich security conference because it's
[02:19:01.800 --> 02:19:05.080]  right there the kind of evidence that we need I've been able to convince a lot
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:09.400]  of skeptics about the powerful conspiracies that evolved at the highest
[02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:12.680]  level of government through that quote and haven't taken it out I think they're
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:17.320]  frankly confident enough now in their manipulated powers that they don't
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:21.880]  they aren't afraid of us anymore now that said still they don't have absolute
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:24.760]  control I think they have effective control but they still have to
[02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:29.320]  manipulate the public through the media they still have to see the internet
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:34.360]  with false conspiracy theories those that denigrate all conspiracy theories
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:38.040]  that's why they have to attack you as with the way they've been doing with the
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:40.920]  agent provocateurs putting the graffiti on the wall
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:45.080]  it's they're still worried about us but I think they're pretty confident
[02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:48.360]  unfortunately I agree with you but more than confidence they're committed they
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:52.120]  can't pull out of this they passed the point of no return a long time ago
[02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:55.480]  let's continue with your global projection into the future and spend time
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:59.080]  on their domestic suppression system they're openly now building
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:05.160]  other i book attention to all u.s drivers who own a vehicle that has less than 130
[02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:09.240]  000 miles with an auto warranty about to expire or no warranty

[02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:39.400]  let's finish up Joel with where you see the globalists going and what their
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:42.600]  master in game is if they are able to successfully
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:47.560]  pull this off what our world is going to look like Joel Scousson
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:51.080]  well let me go back first of all to what i consider a very neat piece of
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:55.320]  disinformation that got into my uncle's book the
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:58.600]  naked capitalist he was the first one to publish the famous
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:02.120]  Roland Gaither quote where he was talking to Norman Dodd about the
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:05.240]  admitting that the purpose of the Ford Foundation and other foundations was
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:08.840]  to seamlessly you know join the United States of the
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:13.560]  Soviet Union in fact a true conspirator like
[02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.720]  Roland Gaither never would have told the truth to a legitimate conservative like
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:20.120]  Norman Dodd trying to investigate what's going on
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:24.680]  what he said had to be a lie but it was it made it believable he had to give
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.880]  some excuse because it was very obvious to the conservatives that my uncle
[02:25:27.880 --> 02:25:31.800]  noted this and the naked communist that the capitalists the people in
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:35.560]  government were continued to fund communism they brought Mao to power
[02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:39.080]  they paved the way for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:44.920]  and the ousted Batista to get to del Castro so either they were communist
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:47.640]  or in fact they were using the comments for something
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:51.640]  and the Roland Gaither quote kind of tends to give a feeling like well there
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:54.120]  was a a benevolent reason for all of this
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:58.040]  assisting communism that so that we can blend these two societies into the
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:02.760]  well 7277 state department document basically says that
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:06.040]  well here's what i think is really happening first of all i think that
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:09.880]  Russia and China are legitimate predator competitors
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:13.320]  for world government control these are not
[02:26:13.320 --> 02:26:17.480]  being controlled directly by the the Anglo-american
[02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:20.440]  it's i agree it's like the british creating hitler
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:24.280]  that's right they were he was he was not their puppet they were in fact
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:28.520]  facilitating him because of the dialectic because they wanted to have more
[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:31.800]  war would give them the excuse to create world government that's like funding
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:35.480]  the radical muslims for 50 years exactly exactly it's like funding the
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:38.680]  environmentalists wouldn't want to shut down domestic oil production
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:42.040]  and that's exactly what they're doing so they play this dialect we have to be
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:45.160]  very careful of absorbing disinformation like that
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:48.920]  which gives plausible reasons for things which are not truly the real reason
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:51.800]  behind it so here's what i think is going to happen you have
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:55.320]  three separate predators china predator centers
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:58.600]  China Russia and the Anglo-american establishment
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:03.880]  or what i call the globalist now they're intending to destroy one another
[02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:07.400]  right now china and russia are in a semi-quasi alliance
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.800]  because they want to take down the west and the the the globalist the west
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:15.320]  effect had been facilitating the rise of communism
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:19.320]  not only to break down other government so they can write in as a rescuer and
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:22.360]  and fade countries from the evils of communism with their
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:28.520]  uh... you know their semi-socialist position slightly better but uh...
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:31.960]  still controlling uh... but more than that uh...
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:35.560]  they are facilitating and hiding and covering up
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:39.560]  for especially russian military dominance russian
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:43.720]  rearmament uh... they're exposing a little bit but always downplaying in
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:46.200]  their annual report about the chinese military threat
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:50.360]  but you notice how much there is no pentagon report on the russian
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:55.480]  military threat any year at all and russia is far in advance
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:59.080]  of red china in terms of the stockpile of nuclear weapons
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:02.200]  underground bunker systems in the yamato mountain area
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:06.200]  and biological chemical weapons clearly preparing to not only win but
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:09.240]  continue to produce nuclear weapons after the beginning
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:13.160]  of the nuclear war and the government's covering for nothing's more telling of
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:17.480]  that in the 1997 story front page new york times about the bunker
[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:20.520]  city under the yamato mountain and the ci says
[02:28:20.520 --> 02:28:23.720]  we're not worried it's defensive well how does they know it was defensive they
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:26.520]  never been in it they were covering for it
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:30.760]  they've never been in it to this day and if they still say that russia is in
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:35.320]  compliance with all three absolute lies so why are they are they communist no
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.240]  they're not common was algerhis a communist yes he joined the party but
[02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:42.520]  i believe algerhis was a globalist who had gone into the
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:46.440]  communist party to help facilitate their integration within the state
[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:51.240]  but to also manipulate well that's like the rockefellers and and arman hammer
[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:55.880]  giving him the industrial funding after world war two and right into vietnam
[02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:59.800]  i mean they have to create the crises so they have an excuse to tax
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:03.320]  and build up their infrastructure which isn't just pointed outward
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:08.040]  it's also pointed inward that's correct so i think what's going to happen is the
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:12.600]  globalist want a third world war russia and china attacking the west
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:16.360]  china will take up the far east i think they'll occupy clear down to australia
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:19.320]  new zealand but at some point during the war it's my
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:23.320]  theory that by the way our own leaders come out of their deep underground
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:25.960]  bunkers and they're not building those for terrorist attack they're building
[02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:29.560]  those because they know there's six new bunkers being built they know there's
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:32.200]  a nuclear war coming joe let's talk about underground
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:35.080]  bases because in the fifties they admitted a lot of this and they've built
[02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:38.440]  huge complexes and i've got some cousins and family
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:41.880]  at from ford hood and other areas in central texas and they say yeah they're
[02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:46.920]  down there railways everything now let's talk about continuity of
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:51.240]  government and their takeover on the other side
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:55.080]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:24.920]  search that term kill web and bombshell barack separately you search bombshell
[02:34:24.920 --> 02:34:28.200]  barack is one search kill web is another and it will lead them to this
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:33.960]  article that just went up three minutes ago at prisonplanet.com google plans to

[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:38.040]  about half his article is quoting joel scalson's i want to spend some time
[02:35:38.040 --> 02:35:41.160]  with joel on that as well in ways we can fight back because i don't think the

[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:28.920]  where i give my in-depth analysis of the news trying to put back as alex does
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:34.120]  the stuff the media purposely beefed out separately you raise this before we get
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:37.480]  into the big picture again and and their domestic control system and how we
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:40.120]  combat that taken back the states and local governments
[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:43.720]  you talked about disinformation campaigns you talked about
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:47.240]  how they try to put out you know unbelievable garbage and even if you try
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:51.560]  to be accurate sometimes you know you you fall for it none of us are perfect
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:55.160]  but clearly and cast sunstein admits this and we have other documents where the
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:58.200]  government admits they're doing it but the white house regulations are
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:01.720]  says they're on the web posing as patriots posing as
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:07.000]  conservatives posing as conspiracy theorists to be outlandish and he said
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.040]  the government mainstream media have no credibility we've read these quotes
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:13.880]  he's been in the associated press he said they also create infighting
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:18.600]  classic co-intel pro that was used in this country and i see them just
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:23.240]  pulling out all the stops on it right now really trying to get us to fight with
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:25.800]  each other and anybody you see on the web in my
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:29.320]  experience who spends even 30 percent of their time or more
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:33.240]  infighting or calling for violence it comes out like howl turner
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:37.720]  their feds absolutely howl turner of course is a classic
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:40.600]  example of some of you really tried to instigate
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:44.520]  infighting intention within the web i think it's very important for us to be
[02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:48.040]  very very careful especially about the doomsday scenarios now i am
[02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:53.000]  ultimately uh pessimistic about things at least i'm hedging my
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:56.920]  bets i feel like even though there's still a chance that we can overturn this
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:40:01.560]  we can only do so if we expose enough of the actual conspiracy facts and
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:05.080]  theories that are there and conspiracy is anathema
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:08.760]  to the mainstream media and to almost everyone has been
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:12.280]  cautioned to think oh you can't accept conspiracy i mean they are
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:16.040]  predisposing the people to reject the very evidence that can blow this thing
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:19.400]  wide open but with all that whether or not we
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:23.320]  can do it or whether or not we can't win the point is we always ought to be
[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:27.160]  prepared for a take down you know it would be
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:31.000]  unwise to be going forward with blind optimism
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.240]  and not understand the warning i'm giving about this third world war nuclear
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:38.600]  war that's been i mean there's got to be some reason why the government is
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:43.480]  protecting the uh the russia in their preparation for war well let's talk
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:46.040]  about what you were getting into with the underground bases
[02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:50.280]  i mean i've had national tv shows here interviewing me saying mr jones you say
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:53.400]  there's underground bases well in switzerland they're public
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:57.000]  with two-year supply of food and weapons for their entire population
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.720]  our government has spent more from the evidence i've seen correct me because
[02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:03.480]  you're an expert in this specific area than other governments like russia and
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:07.320]  china but those aren't for the american people they're for the elite and they
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:10.680]  admit it's part of this continual government program which they can also
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:14.760]  use as their pretext to take over now there's also another element to the
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:18.760]  underground bases occurring there are a lot of secret projects that are going
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:22.200]  on in development in area 51 and other underground secret
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:25.800]  bases and there are bunker systems there's underground factory bases
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:28.680]  they're basically doing what the russians are also doing they're covering
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:31.000]  for the russians and they're covering for their efforts
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.960]  the reason is they do not intend to use these new high-tech weapons to defend
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:41.160]  america they intend as pdpd 60 outlined during the clinton
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.960]  administration to have america absorb a nuclear first strike
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:49.160]  then they can come out of their bunkers and say oh the russians deceived us we
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:51.560]  didn't know that they were preparing just like they
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:56.600]  claim they didn't know about 9 11 they do know and they in fact are inducing
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:00.280]  trying to bend over backwards to appear and to disarm to
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:03.800]  induce the russians to strike because this strike is essential
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:07.560]  for bringing america to its knees military at least the appearance that
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:11.480]  it's on its knees militarily at least the terms of the public military that's
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:14.680]  why i wouldn't have my boys in the military when this strike occurs
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:17.960]  they're going to get nuked and then our government's going to allow it to
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:21.160]  happen they're going to come out of their bunkers and say we're innocent we
[02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:24.200]  didn't know the russians deceived us but now
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:29.320]  we have no choice but to give military power to rebuild give military power to
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:33.720]  a world army to prosecute this great new patriotic war
[02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.320]  and then we'll start to see these secret high-tech weapons come out of the
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:42.040]  underground basis it'll be after the fact after we've lost our liberty
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:46.760]  after we've been talked into giving our sovereignty i agree totally they need
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.520]  these catastrophes because if you read their deeper
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:53.960]  writings that are all published it goes back to the french revolution and the
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:58.280]  jacobins and the illuminati they wanted a 10 day a week
[02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:01.960]  week they wanted to end the family i mean this everything we see in
[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:06.280]  communism and eugenics and socialism and collectivism
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:10.680]  really drew on older ideas but came
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:14.840]  into a type of coalescence during the french revolution
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:18.840]  and that's their model they want a giant kill-off they're obsessed with how the
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:21.960]  black plague killed upwards of half of european
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:25.480]  and and how it supposedly caused a renaissance do you concur with what i
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:27.880]  just said yeah there's every evidence that they
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:31.480]  are going to use war and the biological and chemical weapons will be
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:35.880]  unleashed during that thing as to kill off a large portion of the of the
[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:38.920]  population there's also one other interesting portion of my general
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:42.440]  theory which i want to air that is it's my belief i'm probably the only
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:46.760]  analyst out there that under or that has claims this but i believe
[02:43:46.760 --> 02:43:51.960]  that china is going to betray russia during the prosecution of this third
[02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:55.720]  world war creating a two front war against russia
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:58.120]  russia will be eliminated as one of the predators
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:02.520]  during that and the interesting thing is that the globalists want that because
[02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:05.160]  then if they've got china as a new cold war
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:08.360]  enemy after we've built up their military and given them all that they
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:12.360]  need to help prosecute the war with 11 new false bipolar system that's right
[02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:16.200]  then they can say oh we've got to keep this international military force
[02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:19.960]  active and powerful because we've got a new enemy to wait i mean i actually
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:23.960]  agree with you uh that that that that that sino
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:29.160]  chinese you know split russians chinese split is real because it's come out that
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:34.120]  those deals were actually made in 49 to put malin and then that you know that
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:37.720]  was just the the publication of what was happening with nixon
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:42.200]  in the early 70s of opening it up and now it's been declassified
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:48.680]  that in the 60s russia requested the u.s either aid or stand back
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:52.760]  during a russian nuke attack on china and the united states threatened to nuke
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:57.400]  them if they did that yeah i've heard that too i've not been able to prove
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:01.880]  that was times of london uh i'd heard it too but
[02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:05.320]  it was reportedly declassified by the chinese and
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:10.360]  impartial declassification two months ago and uh in the united states
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:14.120]  now lastly i want to make sure that our listeners understand is
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:18.040]  most of the disinformation on the net to whip up hysteria and to get us
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:21.320]  discredited has to do with imminent marshal law and
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:24.920]  imminent economic collapse there's two reasons why i don't believe that's
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:27.080]  going to happen first of all they don't have the
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:29.960]  forces to implement marshal law they would have to have an excuse
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:33.240]  let's say convince everyone that there's a massive conspiracy
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:36.600]  against liberty i don't think they're going to do that they've usually been
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:39.560]  too smart same thing with an economic class well it's
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:43.160]  slow creeping to interrupt it's slow we're already in marshal law when they
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:47.000]  got naked body scanners in the airport and they're federalizing police and
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.080]  they're turning the the public schools into little prison drill camps
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:53.960]  well let's put it this way they have the authority
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:56.920]  and the constitution is dead as far as these people that they can do anything
[02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:00.040]  they want the judges will will look the other way if they're told to look the
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:02.680]  other way so we've actually lost our freedom
[02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:05.880]  they just haven't implemented that total loss so that they don't get a
[02:46:05.880 --> 02:46:09.080]  rebellion against the people but i think we have to be very careful
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:11.960]  as i say about saying that something is imminent when i don't think
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:14.920]  strategically it's in the globalist best interest
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:19.080]  to do that i think knowing the war is coming they have several major things
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:22.280]  that they've accomplished with the big war comes number one
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:25.720]  they get to implement marshal law and have an excuse that everybody will cheer
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:29.640]  about because there's total chaos going on an e n p a strike will take down this
[02:46:29.640 --> 02:46:32.520]  nation without electricity to a third-world nation
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:36.840]  within hours secondly they get a chance to wipe out all of the death
[02:46:36.840 --> 02:46:40.760]  they've got a collision course with bankruptcy technically they're already
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:44.680]  bank ruptured uh... legally it doesn't happen
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:49.640]  until two thousand and twenty one to twenty two now they see a war as a way to reboot things
[02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:53.160]  that's right because basically if the if the computer centers in washington
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:56.200]  new york it wiped out they can basically there are no more records we gotta start
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:47:01.400]  all over and they get a free slate to do that i think that's the great thing
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:04.440]  about seeing the milk this thing along with inflation
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:07.800]  which that's their only weapon they've got left so i'm not predicting an
[02:47:07.800 --> 02:47:11.160]  economic collapse i'm a downward spiral that will keep going
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:16.280]  but they'll milk it along keep people basically fat and happy until the surprise war comes
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:20.200]  and it will be a shock to everybody they'll use that shock value to talk people into
[02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:23.320]  giving up essential sovereignty in favor of a new world order
[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:26.280]  and then meanwhile like termites in a building they're busy
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:30.600]  you know uh... preparing the full collapse getting all their ducks in a row
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:35.400]  studying us learning how to control us how do we counter that though
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:39.800]  take the states back take the counties the sheriffs back educate people
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:44.120]  about this program it's the local level is the only way that we're going to do
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:47.320]  that and that's why i think we've got to be very careful about teaching people
[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:51.320]  how to do this correctly so much of the tea party movement is being co-opted
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:54.760]  by false leaders coming in with money and that's always the key that they're not
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:57.160]  of us because our people don't have money
[02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:00.120]  the people with big bucks never are principled enough
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:04.520]  to run with a no compromise strategy uh... so i think we have to be smart
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:08.040]  enough to work at the local level and and it's working to a certain extent
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:11.240]  i look every day in the news and see how they're trying to topple
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:15.240]  uh... share an angle against uh... read just a little bit using very very
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:19.080]  subtle uh... attacks to destabilize well they're claiming Rand Paul kidnapped
[02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:24.120]  a lady and it wasn't true but ultimately there's a secret
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:27.400]  government that's going on it has a secret underground basis i knew that
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:30.680]  in fact i really started to research that when all these men
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:34.120]  outlandish claims came about concentration camps on the internet about
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:37.720]  ten years ago remember that the list of three hundred names and i started
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:42.120]  to actually go and research those and most of them were bogus
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:46.920]  absolutely bogus and i thought you know that list still precipitated
[02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:50.440]  still in there today well i've read the urban warfare drills
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:53.960]  the camps of your sports stadiums they can set up in a matter of hours
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:57.320]  the camps are the fact that we have the biggest prison population in the world
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:01.640]  and adjunct to major prison camps they have areas designated
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:06.680]  in the national emergency centers act and that national emergency centers act
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:10.120]  tells you what they've already built they're just saying they want the
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:14.200]  funding to go public uh... it's the old military basis
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:18.920]  that's right and and most of these real true concentration camps are on the
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:22.440]  decommissioned military bases for example they had it right there in plain
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:27.080]  sighted now in north is now a very very nice airport space is a great big
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:30.520]  triple wall prison camp and it was on the actual
[02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:34.680]  uh... list of uh... prison uh... from the
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:37.800]  bureau of prisons up until two years ago when they took it off the list
[02:49:37.800 --> 02:49:41.800]  now the camp is still there i've just visited it and they still have people
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:46.600]  operating that but it's now gone underground it's disappeared
[02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:50.040]  well let me identify one for you and i have this from insiders then it came
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:53.240]  out it was true camp swift was thirty three thousand
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:49:56.360]  acres it's now eleven thousand they have a federal prison
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:00.280]  it's the federal correctional facility at swift in bass drop it's an old german
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:03.640]  prisoner of war camp built on to a real prison
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:06.040]  now you know where they're holding federal prisoners and it's part of the
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:10.520]  civilian inmate labor camp program and it's all hidden in plain view and the
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:13.080]  guards don't even know it they just think oh we're a federal
[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:16.920]  prison but it's a larger complex part of this operation
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:19.720]  that's the same thing with the mellis you go up and talk to the guards they know
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:22.840]  that it's there now we never use that it's but it's there
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:27.000]  and you know it's amazing that uh... glenn beck gets on his program to debunk
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.200]  prison camps and brings out these disinformatician
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:34.200]  artists that uh... popular mechanics to do is so called his independent
[02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:37.080]  researchers and uh... they don't mention
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:42.200]  these prison camps but you're in plain sight amazing interview let's briefly
[02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:46.600]  talk about the main reason i got you on how they're trying to federalize police
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:51.080]  and uh... if they're being successful at that what you call the dark side
[02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:53.960]  and then i'll briefly get your take on who was behind
[02:50:53.960 --> 02:51:01.080]  9-11 and this larger geopolitical uh... strategy
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:04.920]  attention this is a special alert to all americans who owe ten thousand dollars
[02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:09.080]  or more in back taxes to the irs the irs is now accepting reduced settlements
[02:51:09.080 --> 02:51:12.680]  from people who owe back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed due
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:16.520]  to the financial crisis in america the irs has announced a leniency plan in
[02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:20.120]  recognition of consumers financial troubles in today's economy if you owe

[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:47.000]  created asset bombshell barack is one search and kill web is the second
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:52.840]  uh real fast jolscalson uh because your breakdown that i saw in chuck balvin's
[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:55.640]  article about the dark side of the military and police they're creating
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:00.760]  and using they admit this iraq afghanistan with the checkpoints the
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:05.000]  searches and now it's confirmed to train them for domestic operations
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.840]  let's talk briefly about that and then your view on how 9-11 fed into all
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:13.400]  this and who you think's behind it well this is a real infusion story as you
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:17.240]  know from my world first brief or what chuck balvin keyed off of i wrote a
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:20.760]  story about the top secret america essentially that
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:24.120]  whenever the new york times comes up with a major story pretending to unmask
[02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:27.640]  the government they serve readers should be very skeptical
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:31.080]  the bush administration for example permitted leakers from within the
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:34.520]  government to cattle on some unlawful domestic spying a little bitty
[02:55:34.520 --> 02:55:38.760]  piece of it but this was a planted story in order to partially address the
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:42.520]  problem make the public feel satisfied now the government has been exposed and
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:46.920]  chastened neither occurred later of course legislation was passed to allow
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:51.560]  modest domestic spying to continue under the old justifying war on terror and
[02:55:51.560 --> 02:55:55.480]  that related to 9-11 why 9-11 had to be a government operation
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:59.560]  could justify this all continuing war on terror
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:03.480]  that's the real purpose of the story on leaking domestic spying or
[02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:06.920]  small portions of it was to divert the public from knowing that government
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:10.840]  spying on americans is total universal in scope
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:14.120]  collecting all domestic and international communication
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:17.880]  in the same vein when the washington post began the first of these installments
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:22.920]  on top secret america it was purported to expose the massive growth and
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:25.880]  inefficiency of the burgeoning intelligence community
[02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:29.720]  it was a cover story to make the public feel now that government wasted and
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:32.760]  efficiently have been exposed that that was the only problem
[02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:37.480]  and totally i repeat totally neglected the whole story which was the
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:41.400]  substantive issues of illegal and uncontrolled
[02:56:41.400 --> 02:56:45.320]  surveillance disinformation drug running all the things that goes on in the
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:49.880]  black section of government now to address your
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:53.240]  question directly the government during the timothy
[02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:57.880]  mcbay era and beyond used to recruit directly that is the ti would go to
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:01.800]  military people and they would recruit people mostly out of
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:07.320]  special services uh into the ti directly as they did timothy mcbay
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:12.120]  now they switch streams and they use private military contractors
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:15.800]  these are set up by people who have insider connection to government you and i
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:19.560]  cannot go to the a t f of the i want to life is to have automatic weapons to
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:22.040]  start a private military contractor firm
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:26.120]  we can't do it they just laugh at your face uh and i've told in the world
[02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:29.320]  appears brief how triple canopy got started now it came in
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:32.360]  sure we got one minute we'll talk about it a week and a half but one minute
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:35.880]  bottom line 9 11 private contractors no
[02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:40.120]  absolutely a government inside operation okay now the private contractors
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:43.480]  were in fact the terrorists at the al-qaeda level who were hired by them i
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:45.880]  don't think the people running the airplane knew they were working
[02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:49.960]  directly for the u.s but the people at the higher level of al-qaeda
[02:57:49.960 --> 02:57:53.960]  were working for the cia through saudi arabia
[02:57:53.960 --> 02:58:01.160]  uh other details well obviously the explosion and the the proofs about
[02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:04.840]  explosive elements within the world trade center the biggest proof that this
[02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:08.120]  was an inside government operation there's no way that those buildings could
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:11.160]  have come down as stated by the government without high-powered
[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:14.120]  explosives that means there's over a hundred people out there
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:17.560]  who put those explosives in the buildings or keeping a secret
[02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:21.720]  they've been threatened of course but that's how this works all right joel
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:26.200]  skelson amazing look forward to you being on with this august
[02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:30.680]  31st have a great uh friday and weekend coming up god bless you look forward to
