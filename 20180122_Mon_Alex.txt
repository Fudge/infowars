[00:00:09.887 --> 00:00:18.151]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:18.792]  Well, the U.S.
[00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:21.073]  Senate is set to vote any time now.
[00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:28.517]  Of course, they're late on the government shutdown that we're now into what, day four of.
[00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:29.638]  And I've analyzed this.
[00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:31.318]  It's not hard to analyze.
[00:00:31.318 --> 00:00:32.219]  It's an absolute fact.
[00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.661]  It's the Democrats that voted to shut the government down.
[00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:47.340]  It's Democrats that are basically globalists holding the country hostage, saying we have to acquiesce to the border being completely open, or we're all evil, horrible racists.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.061]  And that dovetails with the one thing that can get me stuck at my computer or my television for four or five hours.
[00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:59.522]  Not movies, not dramas, not Netflix binges.
[00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:00.882]  Don't do it!
[00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:03.203]  Other than on the treadmill or the elliptical.
[00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:04.543]  Then I might watch an hour of a show.
[00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:20.115]  I spent hours yesterday and hours this morning, I didn't have, but still it was very informative, watching footage shot in Austin over the weekend, footage shot in LA over the weekend, and footage shot in New York.
[00:01:20.115 --> 00:01:30.478]  I was watching live feeds, I was watching archives of it, and then the crew uploaded like 50 videos or something yesterday that they hadn't been able to get up.
[00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:33.378]  And I'm watching these.
[00:01:33.378 --> 00:01:35.439]  We're not cherry picking leftists.
[00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:39.839]  At the Women's March spitting on women.
[00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:45.360]  We're not cherry-picking people running up to Millie Weaver in her face and farting on her.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.800]  Grown men.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.461]  This is hour after hour after hour of a lunatic asylum.
[00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:58.362]  You don't go out to conservative rallies and get treated like this.
[00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:02.683]  I mean, the mentally ill scumbag KKK doesn't act like this.
[00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:04.183]  These people are
[00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:11.790]  Certifiably nuts, and it's beyond Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:24.994]  We also noticed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cups, and we went up and videotaped them in both cities, and it was all extreme soy latte.
[00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:26.835]  These are men addicted to estrogen.
[00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:28.503]  It's bizarre.
[00:02:28.503 --> 00:02:29.183]  It's chemical.
[00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:34.168]  And again, people say, oh, well, some InfoWars live products, say, may contain soy.
[00:02:34.168 --> 00:02:36.550]  That's because it's in factories that have it.
[00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.717]  And they use some of the protein from that and rice on the conveyor belts so that things don't stick as an anti-clotting agent.
[00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:45.798]  And that's regular soy, and it's microscopic.
[00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:57.608]  What they put in the modern soy products is they take the whole soybean and the core of its pure plant estrogen, and they process that, and then you get that.
[00:02:57.608 --> 00:02:59.429]  You're not supposed to eat that.
[00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.651]  You could eat some soy in your diet.
[00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:07.015]  Occasionally, you know, I'll get some pure tofu and eat it in a stir-fry or something, because it's all part of a balance.
[00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:11.518]  We're meant to eat some plant estrogens.
[00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:12.059]  That's normal.
[00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:16.977]  There's also testosterone and stuff in meat and other hormones.
[00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:18.258]  So it all balances out.
[00:03:18.258 --> 00:03:25.624]  But not when these men are addicted to it and they talk about how they're addicted to it and they're obsessed on it.
[00:03:25.624 --> 00:03:30.748]  So we're going to play some of these videos coming up today as well.
[00:03:30.748 --> 00:03:34.511]  But also these people don't look well.
[00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:37.834]  Black, white, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.016]  They look like goblins.
[00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:42.518]  And we discovered more horrific goblin creatures.
[00:03:43.732 --> 00:03:50.234]  The women act like goblins, the men act like goblins, and it's getting worse.
[00:03:50.234 --> 00:03:52.315]  So that's all coming up.
[00:03:52.315 --> 00:04:00.838]  Also, I cut a little song this morning, I don't know if it'll be ready today, to go with Conan O'Brien's big report that's on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:04.140]  It's totally blown up in his face spectacularly.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:13.263]  Conan O'Brien claims Haiti is beautiful after visiting a luxury tourist resort that's in between a mountain ridge and is still dangerous.
[00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:16.505]  He went in for a photo shoot.
[00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:17.326]  Got in the water.
[00:04:17.326 --> 00:04:19.566]  Nose keeps his head well above it, though.
[00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:22.827]  There's guaranteed a couple little turds floating by.
[00:04:22.827 --> 00:04:28.068]  And... He then said it's wondrous and not a crap hole.
[00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:29.868]  By the way, I've talked to aid workers, you name it.
[00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:31.829]  My crew's been there doing aid.
[00:04:31.829 --> 00:04:36.210]  I mean, the locals call it a you-know-what hole, because people crap all over the ground.
[00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.590]  Like, Calcutta's a hole.
[00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.271]  Some areas of India are great.
[00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.311]  Some areas of Mexico are great.
[00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:41.811]  Some of them are.
[00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:43.491]  Holds.
[00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:44.772]  Not this bad.
[00:04:44.772 --> 00:04:46.273]  But damn, North Korea's a hellhole.
[00:04:46.273 --> 00:04:51.356]  But the virtue signaling of Conan O'Brien has blown up spectacularly in his face.
[00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:53.357]  So we're gonna put his image to video.
[00:04:53.357 --> 00:04:54.077]  We shot in Haiti.
[00:04:54.077 --> 00:04:55.518]  It's gonna be really powerful.
[00:04:55.518 --> 00:04:55.978]  Get ready.
[00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:02.299]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:06.282]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:05:06.282 --> 00:05:09.624]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:05:09.624 --> 00:05:12.146]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:16.889]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.230]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.635]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:34.445]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:05:34.445 --> 00:05:39.490]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:46.478]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:52.043]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:05:52.043 --> 00:05:57.206]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:57.206 --> 00:06:09.655]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:13.538]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:29.768]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:36.695]  We now take you live to the year 2018.
[00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:44.603]  January 22nd, on a Monday transmission, the United States is locked in a bitter information-based civil war.
[00:06:46.192 --> 00:06:57.739]  Powerful global banks are attempting to ban free speech and are forming paramilitary brigades to go out and intimidate citizens that dare show up on the street.
[00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:10.507]  World government is in major decline as world populations discover that it is an unelected, secret, transhumanist, anti-human, eugenics-based, technocracy combine.
[00:07:10.507 --> 00:07:12.208]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:13.408]  This is not science fiction.
[00:07:13.408 --> 00:07:14.589]  This is not a drill.
[00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:15.370]  This is present
[00:07:16.184 --> 00:07:16.784]  Space time.
[00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:20.926]  Look at this headline.
[00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:24.167]  Europe moves ahead with internet censorship.
[00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:28.929]  Enforcement as more platforms join.
[00:07:28.929 --> 00:07:36.532]  Google, Facebook, Twitter are all announcing that they will ban anyone criticizing Islam in any way or reporting crime.
[00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:40.789]  Next they're saying mother and father will not be allowed.
[00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:42.929]  I'm not joking, it's being announced in the rules.
[00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.489]  Someone may not have a mother and father.
[00:07:44.489 --> 00:07:47.890]  We're going to go into total cult control.
[00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.971]  And then at your work or your business you will be intimidated, you will be demoted, you will be fired.
[00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:59.012]  You will use the words they say, you will conform, you will submit to the hive mind, or you will be thrown out on the street.
[00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:02.993]  Now they're attempting this authoritarian takeover in the middle of once free societies.
[00:08:02.993 --> 00:08:05.974]  It's not going to go well if people simply stand up and say no.
[00:08:07.677 --> 00:08:08.898]  So that's coming up.
[00:08:08.898 --> 00:08:13.063]  Of course, right now we can give you some of the ambient noise there in the Senate chamber.
[00:08:13.063 --> 00:08:17.068]  They are milling about starting their new vote on the government shutdown.
[00:08:17.068 --> 00:08:18.990]  Today would be day number four.
[00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.873]  So again, we'll pull that up for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[00:08:21.873 --> 00:08:23.275]  We'll put that on screen.
[00:08:23.755 --> 00:08:28.256]  So again, you've got C-SPAN itself now, even editorializers, instead of letting you hear the background vote, you're being told,
[00:08:54.044 --> 00:09:00.430]  I guess how bad the Republicans are because they aren't letting the globalists and the UN plan to completely erase borders take place.
[00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.273]  So we'll follow that as that unfolds, as that vote begins.
[00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:08.837]  Supposing it begins shortly.
[00:09:08.837 --> 00:09:15.023]  And again, we're going to be playing some excerpts today, but there's no way to do it justice what
[00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.832]  The crew did in New York, in Austin, and in Los Angeles.
[00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:26.135]  We had crews out in all three major leftist fester points.
[00:09:27.287 --> 00:09:47.968]  And we went out and we videotaped live and also in HD, which we've now uploaded the HD versions, of just vicious, hateful, bullying thugs spitting on women, men squatting and farting on women, women giggling and laughing, all acting very immature.
[00:09:47.968 --> 00:09:50.951]  Almost all the men don't have jobs and they walk behind the woman
[00:09:52.418 --> 00:10:09.726]  And they've replaced stereotypical gender roles and women wear a vest and command everyone and tell men and women do not talk to them, they're not real, then people dutifully don't talk to us unless it's the occasional somewhat alpha male which attacks women and spits on people.
[00:10:11.636 --> 00:10:14.238]  See, this guy right here just spit on a woman.
[00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:16.599]  Here's the guy farting on Millie Weaver.
[00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:19.962]  And again, it's hard to play all this because there's just so much background.
[00:10:19.962 --> 00:10:21.983]  F you, scum, we're gonna murder you!
[00:10:21.983 --> 00:10:24.385]  F you, your family, screw up your children, die!
[00:10:24.385 --> 00:10:30.029]  Just like ravenous demons, like vicious dogs behind the fences.
[00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:38.695]  The total desire, we're gonna control language, your kids belong to us, we're gonna force-inoculate you, we're gonna force-feed your GMO, world government!
[00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:45.282]  And they're all on video going, we want no borders, no borders!
[00:10:45.282 --> 00:10:51.206]  But they'll set up walls to try to not let people in.
[00:10:51.206 --> 00:10:55.109]  They'll block you getting into your event.
[00:10:55.109 --> 00:11:03.276]  And a lot of people were physically attacked when Antifa showed up in New York at the Night for Freedom event.
[00:11:03.276 --> 00:11:07.439]  And then, Bradley Manning showed up.
[00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:23.942]  Bradley Manning showed up, formerly Bradley Manning, Chelsea Manning, and came into the event that Cernovich and Owen Schroer and all these other great people were there.
[00:11:25.748 --> 00:11:30.389]  James O'Keefe, the list goes on and on, Stefan Molyneux, and they're just all video of it.
[00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:31.350]  Oh, hi, how you doing?
[00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.070]  Great to see you.
[00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.150]  Welcome.
[00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.191]  Oh, yeah, you want to speak?
[00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:35.691]  Oh, no, you don't want to.
[00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:37.132]  Chelsea Manning then sends out tweets.
[00:11:37.132 --> 00:11:43.934]  These are horrible, homophobic, bigot, scum, and I came to face these vicious people, these pieces of trash.
[00:11:43.934 --> 00:11:52.556]  Meanwhile, you go outside, Antifa's throwing urine, attacking police, attacking men, women, children, just screaming, yelling, trying to beat people up.
[00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:54.477]  This is just footage in New York, the Women's March itself.
[00:11:55.711 --> 00:12:03.153]  And again, there's our reporters just trying to cover it being spit on, but at nighttime, it's just frothing crowds trying to attack.
[00:12:03.153 --> 00:12:04.913]  Oh, hi, Chelsea Manning!
[00:12:04.913 --> 00:12:05.653]  Come on in!
[00:12:05.653 --> 00:12:08.614]  Hey, welcome!
[00:12:08.614 --> 00:12:16.196]  And then Chelsea tweets out, I went and I faced down those white supremacist, homophobe scum myself.
[00:12:16.196 --> 00:12:17.456]  Yay!
[00:12:17.456 --> 00:12:19.116]  You're like Conan O'Brien!
[00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:20.957]  He flew into one of the little isolated
[00:12:22.197 --> 00:12:22.477]  I don't know.
[00:12:37.383 --> 00:12:45.469]  Trump spent millions sending in a whole bunch of doctors to do thousands and thousands of eye surgeries and things that could really help people, but that doesn't matter.
[00:12:45.469 --> 00:12:50.552]  If you'd have stole 2 billion, 97% of the Haitian money like the Clintons did, then you'd be good.
[00:12:50.552 --> 00:13:04.762]  Or, if you're like the One Foundation, I guess it's called One because he gives 1% to the African and Caribbean charities, you know, because you show black people at a YouTube concert on international television and say, send your money, whites,
[00:13:06.169 --> 00:13:10.094]  Virtue signal, and they send the money to Bono, who keeps it! 99%!
[00:13:12.711 --> 00:13:14.492]  And then he virtue signals.
[00:13:14.492 --> 00:13:16.413]  But that's okay to rob their money.
[00:13:16.413 --> 00:13:23.156]  We just send in plane loads of food and reporters that give 100% of the money we've made directly to them.
[00:13:23.156 --> 00:13:27.078]  Not because we're virtue signaling, but because we're actually trying to illustrate what's going on.
[00:13:27.078 --> 00:13:36.843]  But see, that doesn't matter that we land on grass airfields the day the hurricane left and someone died taking off that exact airfield that day.
[00:13:36.843 --> 00:13:39.845]  Doesn't matter that evil whiteys were there dying.
[00:13:39.845 --> 00:13:41.866]  If they would have just gone and drank out of a coconut,
[00:13:42.766 --> 00:13:44.608]  And, you know, and don't get too close to black people.
[00:13:44.608 --> 00:13:49.572]  He's about 50 yards away, recorded to Conan, you know, because he, I think you should get close to him, but he's a liberal friend.
[00:13:49.572 --> 00:13:50.793]  He doesn't get too close.
[00:13:50.793 --> 00:13:54.015]  And there he is about 50 yards away for his nice photo op in and out.
[00:13:54.015 --> 00:13:57.798]  The one spot you can get into, no doubt, armed guards on the beach.
[00:13:57.798 --> 00:14:02.842]  Boop, boop, in out, drink your coconut and say, Haiti is truly a beautiful country.
[00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:06.305]  Hashtag, Conan Haiti.
[00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:11.389]  And it's all been taken over, putting him in images on Infowars.com.
[00:14:14.534 --> 00:14:18.677]  Where he actually would be if he was actually in Haiti, looking at what's going on.
[00:14:18.677 --> 00:14:37.692]  If you go to our story on Infowars.com, we can scroll through it, and see where Twitter's sphere on the internet has gone absolutely crazy, taking Conan O'Brien's photo and photoshopping it into the supposed lovely scenes.
[00:14:37.692 --> 00:14:39.093]  I guess go camera shot right there.
[00:14:39.093 --> 00:14:40.294]  Yeah, we can show folks.
[00:14:40.294 --> 00:14:41.355]  There it is.
[00:14:41.355 --> 00:14:43.517]  And so people photoshopped
[00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:51.995]  him into real scenes there in Haiti.
[00:14:51.995 --> 00:14:54.396]  So I suggest everyone go and see that for yourself.
[00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:57.059]  And that is exactly what Haiti really looks like.
[00:14:57.059 --> 00:14:59.280]  It is unbelievable.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:09.369]  Now as best I know, Sean Penn, who wants to be our savior, actually does give a ton of money to Haiti.
[00:15:09.369 --> 00:15:12.791]  Remember when he tried to go to Katrina and his boat sank?
[00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:14.433]  He couldn't even make the boat work?
[00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:19.168]  Well, you know, he goes there and he walks around with a gun, by the way.
[00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.288]  With a Glock on his side.
[00:15:20.288 --> 00:15:24.890]  And I told you, I've talked to Sean Penn before.
[00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.190]  The guy's literally brain dead.
[00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.612]  I mean, he's probably got about a 75 IQ.
[00:15:30.612 --> 00:15:32.132]  So he doesn't talk.
[00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:34.193]  Everybody just stands around and goes, oh, you're so smart.
[00:15:34.193 --> 00:15:35.673]  Hollywood goes, he's the genius.
[00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:41.375]  He's a... Just totally stupid.
[00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:45.365]  Hey, but here's some real footage for TV viewers.
[00:15:45.365 --> 00:15:47.789]  Is this where Cohen and O'Brien went?
[00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:48.470]  No.
[00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.432]  He just tells you everything's fine in Haiti.
[00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:51.494]  Everything's good.
[00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:52.916]  How dare Trump actually try to help Haiti?
[00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:55.019]  If he just stole all their money, then it'd be okay.
[00:15:58.339 --> 00:15:59.159]  This is Dan Pilla.
[00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.940]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.581]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[00:17:04.897 --> 00:17:06.479]  But the symptoms are there.

[00:20:15.345 --> 00:20:23.757]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:26.567 --> 00:20:28.328]  This is going to be an incredible week.
[00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.270]  We've got Davos kicking off.
[00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.751]  We're going to have President Trump there.
[00:20:32.751 --> 00:20:34.333]  We've got mainstream headlines.
[00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:37.034]  Newsweek killed Trump with his own weapon.
[00:20:37.034 --> 00:20:40.217]  Protesters march against President ahead of Davos.
[00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:46.529]  Kill Trump is the name of the march, and there's Newsweek promoting it.
[00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:52.771]  Davos 2018, Donald Trump delivers special address at World Economic Forum despite protest.
[00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:56.652]  And they're using the right wing to attack Trump, just like they said he was going to sell us out on DACA.
[00:20:56.652 --> 00:20:59.432]  He didn't, of course.
[00:20:59.432 --> 00:21:00.973]  They're saying, oh, he's going to Davos.
[00:21:00.973 --> 00:21:01.773]  He's a globalist.
[00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:13.638]  No, his actions are killing globalism, returning power to America, killing TPP, renegotiating NAFTA and GATT, not doing one-sided deals.
[00:21:13.638 --> 00:21:16.299]  And you already see the economy roaring back.
[00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:25.286]  And that's what this government shutdown is all about, was for the one-year anniversary of his election to not have it be the incredible oxygen
[00:21:26.582 --> 00:21:27.964]  Let's come back into the room.
[00:21:27.964 --> 00:21:37.695]  The big deep breath of fresh air of hundreds of billions of dollars paid to workers in bonuses and pay increases.
[00:21:37.695 --> 00:21:39.798]  The military getting pay increases.
[00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.580]  26,000 in the stock market.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.442]  Thousands of companies moving back.
[00:21:43.442 --> 00:21:44.683]  The massive tax cuts.
[00:21:44.683 --> 00:21:45.825]  The corporations coming back.
[00:21:45.825 --> 00:21:46.606]  Apple coming back.
[00:21:48.183 --> 00:21:52.988]  Apple's announcing major moves back here and high-paying jobs under US regulations.
[00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:58.092]  It won't be suicide nets and forced abortion and drugging the plant workers.
[00:21:58.092 --> 00:22:00.495]  It'll be actual Apple factories.
[00:22:00.495 --> 00:22:04.739]  Sure, it won't be perfect, but it'll be high-paid.
[00:22:04.739 --> 00:22:05.319]  Comparatively.
[00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.352]  The announcement they've made is $350 billion.
[00:22:11.352 --> 00:22:12.952]  That was Tim Cook last week.
[00:22:12.952 --> 00:22:14.853]  Look, I gotta stop right there.
[00:22:14.853 --> 00:22:18.735]  They just don't want a discussion of this, as I said last Friday.
[00:22:18.735 --> 00:22:26.318]  And that's what Mulvaney, White House spokesman, says Democrats shut down government to avoid talking about Trump's success.
[00:22:26.318 --> 00:22:35.363]  Instead, the Schumer right now, they're about to vote the Senate, and they say, oh, tune in at 11 Central, and then they
[00:22:36.468 --> 00:22:47.291]  Makes you sit there and wait while Schumer and the Democrats, those old, evil, racist mummies who use race voting to control people, that use third world labor to drive down everybody's wages.
[00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:54.453]  I mean, the Democrats have three times the money of the Republicans, if you stack the wealth up.
[00:22:54.453 --> 00:22:58.013]  Just in the Congress, in the House and Senate.
[00:22:58.013 --> 00:22:59.414]  Look it up.
[00:22:59.414 --> 00:23:02.675]  They've done the math of billionaires.
[00:23:02.675 --> 00:23:03.955]  Did you know that
[00:23:05.819 --> 00:23:10.283]  99% of billionaires are quote liberal worldwide.
[00:23:10.283 --> 00:23:11.744]  They're not liberal.
[00:23:11.744 --> 00:23:20.591]  They want global government to control people and to get people dependent so that they don't know how to take care of themselves.
[00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:22.833]  So this is what's happening.
[00:23:22.833 --> 00:23:26.176]  And as Mulvaney's pointed out, Trump isn't demanding a bunch of stuff.
[00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:28.438]  He's ready to compromise.
[00:23:28.438 --> 00:23:34.623]  He isn't weaponizing things saying you give me exactly what I want because I have the trifecta or I will
[00:23:36.155 --> 00:23:37.656]  Do whatever I want.
[00:23:37.656 --> 00:23:38.937]  No.
[00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:41.278]  They had a deal to legalize 800,000 people.
[00:23:41.278 --> 00:23:42.819]  That's what he said back in the campaign.
[00:23:42.819 --> 00:23:44.060]  You've lived here for 20-something years.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:45.381]  You don't have a criminal record.
[00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:47.202]  You were here when you were a young person.
[00:23:47.202 --> 00:23:49.284]  We'll make it faster for you to be a citizen.
[00:23:49.284 --> 00:23:53.566]  And we'll make it faster for everybody.
[00:23:53.566 --> 00:24:00.391]  But the Democrats want it super hard to become a citizen so that you're a permanent underclass they control.
[00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:15.117]  It's blowing up in the Democrats' face right now, so they're starting to say, okay, maybe we will end the shutdown, because America sees through it, and I see a lot of hope happening.
[00:24:15.117 --> 00:24:19.760]  Zucker was fired at CNN last Friday.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.022]  As we told you four months ago, he would.
[00:24:22.022 --> 00:24:23.262]  Roger Stone had dinner.
[00:24:23.262 --> 00:24:26.845]  They're always accusing Roger of having dinner with the Russians or made-up crap.
[00:24:26.845 --> 00:24:31.608]  He had dinner with the people, and
[00:24:32.967 --> 00:24:34.748]  Was told it's a done deal.
[00:24:34.748 --> 00:24:37.469]  He is gone by January of next year.
[00:24:37.469 --> 00:24:38.709]  And he's gone!
[00:24:38.709 --> 00:24:49.474]  And suddenly CNN, over the weekend on three different shows, this is coming up in the next segment, we might just play it now, said Russiagate is over.
[00:24:49.474 --> 00:24:50.414]  Everybody's sick of it.
[00:24:50.414 --> 00:24:51.435]  They're tired of it.
[00:24:51.435 --> 00:24:52.715]  It's not real.
[00:24:52.715 --> 00:24:55.296]  You talk to people out in the middle of the country and all of a sudden they're tired of it.
[00:24:55.296 --> 00:24:56.817]  They see the economy coming back.
[00:24:56.817 --> 00:25:01.279]  There's a real sense that it's really going to come back this time.
[00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:01.819]  Well guess what?
[00:25:04.192 --> 00:25:06.173]  This whole country was built on bubbles.
[00:25:06.173 --> 00:25:10.376]  China has bubbles five to ten times bigger than ours, with more government money put in.
[00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:14.759]  We're just simply having a bubble for the people now, and that's a lot better than a total implosion.
[00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:23.465]  And I started to look at everybody out there, promoting that America's going to implode and that bubbles are bad, but they're all riding the Chinese bubble and invested there.
[00:25:23.465 --> 00:25:26.067]  Oh, and I forgot to mention it.
[00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:28.309]  The Communist Chinese are all over the news.
[00:25:29.927 --> 00:25:38.755]  Siding with the Democrats in our internal politics, saying the shutdown shows America's economy's bad and we're not going to come back, on and on and on.
[00:25:38.755 --> 00:25:44.980]  And they've lowered their taxes to zero to counter Trump's tax cuts, to 15% for corporations.
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.943]  And they're involved paying off all our major universities.
[00:25:47.943 --> 00:25:50.585]  That was even in the Washington Post last week.
[00:25:52.256 --> 00:25:56.842]  And Twitter and internal videos admits they take orders from the Chinese government.
[00:25:56.842 --> 00:26:05.653]  They have direct managers that take directives from the People's Party over there, which is an unelected group of dictators, an oligarchy.
[00:26:07.315 --> 00:26:09.356]  You can't make this up.
[00:26:09.356 --> 00:26:11.518]  China is in our business, folks.
[00:26:11.518 --> 00:26:13.039]  They're in their own people's business.
[00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:20.184]  You're a Buddhist, they catch you practicing that in your house, you're going to a work camp until somebody wants your organs and you're going to be harvested.
[00:26:20.184 --> 00:26:21.184]  But that's liberal!
[00:26:21.184 --> 00:26:27.929]  The left would sit there and rip the livers out of those Chinese women and just shove them in their fat mouths if they could, I'm telling you.
[00:26:27.929 --> 00:26:30.130]  The left loves power!
[00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.011]  Raw evil!
[00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:40.840]  And they get every sycophantic, cowardly scumbag who wants to have a piece of the power to get in there and screw everybody over until the automated technocracy's in place.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:48.305]  And these idiots and all these underground Twitter videos of Project Veritas all go, we're putting in automation now and it'll be much easier.
[00:26:48.305 --> 00:26:52.508]  You won't be there anymore, dumbass!
[00:26:52.508 --> 00:26:58.832]  It's going automated, fool!
[00:26:58.832 --> 00:27:01.554]  So again, Trump's gonna be in Davos in three days, we're gonna be covering it all.
[00:27:02.631 --> 00:27:05.696]  I said I was going to send a crew, but I just don't think I have the capital, quite frankly.
[00:27:05.696 --> 00:27:08.581]  I only put up a donate button.
[00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:10.784]  People only give us, you know, $20,000 to send a crew there.
[00:27:10.784 --> 00:27:12.207]  It's very expensive.
[00:27:12.207 --> 00:27:15.271]  To even get in is like $100,000, but we'd be on the outskirts covering it.
[00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:16.093]  It'd be very important.
[00:27:16.093 --> 00:27:16.574]  Maybe we should.
[00:27:18.064 --> 00:27:19.705]  I'm going to make a decision in the next few hours.
[00:27:19.705 --> 00:27:21.486]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:27:21.486 --> 00:27:24.888]  When we come back, I'm just going to blitz through tons of news.
[00:27:24.888 --> 00:27:27.109]  By the way, if you just tuned in, you're listening on radio.
[00:27:27.109 --> 00:27:31.971]  Even the New York Times admits China is controlling Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
[00:27:31.971 --> 00:27:35.073]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:27:35.073 --> 00:27:39.815]  And then they get up there on Congress and say, we are shut Alex Jones down at lunch.
[00:27:39.815 --> 00:27:41.676]  He was number one on Twitter.
[00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:42.897]  Paul Watson was number one.
[00:27:42.897 --> 00:27:46.298]  And they have hearings going good.
[00:27:46.298 --> 00:27:47.499]  You shut him down more.
[00:27:48.902 --> 00:27:53.385]  And then I've got right here, Europe moves ahead with internet censorship enforcement.
[00:27:53.385 --> 00:28:01.992]  As more platforms join, they say any form of conservatism, nationalism, will be shut down.
[00:28:01.992 --> 00:28:07.676]  Or Europe is going to fine Germany, France, you name it, millions of dollars per infraction.
[00:28:07.676 --> 00:28:12.680]  You report that a Muslim killed somebody?
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.961]  You're not just going to get arrested.
[00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:16.576]  They're gonna get fined.
[00:28:16.576 --> 00:28:19.617]  And they have actually hired the former Stasi in Germany.
[00:28:19.617 --> 00:28:21.118]  This is mainstream news.
[00:28:21.118 --> 00:28:30.762]  Former Stasi captains and lieutenant colonels in a spy operation, that's super high, to run it.
[00:28:30.762 --> 00:28:31.983]  To run it.
[00:28:31.983 --> 00:28:36.825]  I mean, you cannot make up the full magnitude of this evil hitting us between the eyes.
[00:28:36.825 --> 00:28:39.967]  But the good news is we're fighting back and they're failing and they're gonna lose.
[00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:45.959]  But we need you to spread the articles and spread the videos and defend the Republic and defend free speech everywhere and exercise it.
[00:28:45.959 --> 00:28:49.205]  I know you go out on the street and Antifa spits on you and points guns at you.
[00:28:49.205 --> 00:28:49.966]  I understand.
[00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:52.830]  They're going to try to shut us down on the web and in the street.
[00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.316]  But believe me, they're going to get their ass handed to them real soon.
[00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:02.833]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, the inventor of MyPillow, and like all of you out there, I had problems sleeping.
[00:29:02.833 --> 00:29:10.478]  Pillows would go flat, I would flip-flop all night long, I would wake up with a sore neck, maybe a headache, or feel like I needed a nap even though I slept eight hours.
[00:29:10.478 --> 00:29:18.503]  When I invented MyPillow, I wanted it to where you can move the patent and fill to give you the exact support you need as an individual, regardless of sleep position.
[00:29:18.743 --> 00:29:23.006]  MyPillow will get you into that deep REM sleep faster and you will stay there longer.
[00:29:23.006 --> 00:29:24.948]  It's not about how much time we spend in bed.
[00:29:24.948 --> 00:29:27.489]  It's about how much of that quality sleep we get.
[00:29:27.489 --> 00:29:30.391]  I do all of my own manufacturing right here in the United States.
[00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:31.813]  I have a 10-year warranty.
[00:29:31.813 --> 00:29:37.497]  You can wash and dry MyPillow and I give you a 60-day money-back guarantee so you have nothing to lose.
[00:29:37.497 --> 00:29:39.078]  And here's my best offer ever.
[00:29:39.078 --> 00:29:41.960]  You can buy one of MyPillows and get one absolutely free.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.381]  Go to MyPillow.com
[00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:45.843]  Call 800-870-0305 and use promo code GCN.
[00:29:45.843 --> 00:29:48.786]  That's MyPillow.com or 800-870-0305 with promo code GCN.
[00:29:58.928 --> 00:30:07.192]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[00:30:07.192 --> 00:30:08.412]  A 360 win.
[00:30:08.412 --> 00:30:14.975]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[00:30:14.975 --> 00:30:22.499]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:30:22.899 --> 00:30:27.560]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:34.062]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:30:34.062 --> 00:30:41.864]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:30:41.864 --> 00:30:48.386]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:30:48.386 --> 00:30:49.886]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:30:50.046 --> 00:30:52.467]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:54.448]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:30:54.448 --> 00:30:58.611]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:30:58.611 --> 00:31:03.273]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride-free products.
[00:31:03.273 --> 00:31:10.918]  InfoWarsLife brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano-silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[00:31:10.918 --> 00:31:14.860]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:21.262]  Prepare this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[00:31:21.262 --> 00:31:27.864]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:31:27.864 --> 00:31:38.008]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:31:38.248 --> 00:31:45.035]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[00:31:45.035 --> 00:31:47.918]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[00:31:47.918 --> 00:31:51.521]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:56.526]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:56.526 --> 00:31:58.828]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:58.828 --> 00:32:00.911]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:01.211]  Go ahead.
[00:32:01.838 --> 00:32:03.700]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.583]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:09.004]  It just gets old, man.
[00:32:09.004 --> 00:32:11.446]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:32:11.446 --> 00:32:13.748]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:32:13.748 --> 00:32:17.771]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:20.194]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:32:21.074 --> 00:32:23.375]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:25.096]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:32:25.096 --> 00:32:26.216]  Us being shut down?
[00:32:26.216 --> 00:32:27.697]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:32:27.697 --> 00:32:28.777]  You know what, Alex?
[00:32:28.777 --> 00:32:29.877]  Put him on pause again.
[00:32:29.877 --> 00:32:30.978]  Hey, Frank!
[00:32:30.978 --> 00:32:36.640]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.161]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:32:41.161 --> 00:32:44.303]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:32:44.303 --> 00:32:44.763]  You understand?
[00:32:44.763 --> 00:32:46.403]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:32:46.403 --> 00:32:47.524]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:32:48.504 --> 00:32:54.107]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:32:54.107 --> 00:32:54.948]  Do you understand?
[00:32:54.948 --> 00:32:56.468]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:32:56.468 --> 00:33:01.811]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:33:01.811 --> 00:33:10.476]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.476 --> 00:33:16.159]  It's 2018.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.001]  Global government's here, and it's collapsing.
[00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:27.404]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:27.404 --> 00:33:31.866]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas.
[00:33:31.866 --> 00:33:36.208]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:48.036]  Facebook, Google, Twitter, they're all working with the EU and Communist China to shut down free speech in their countries and here.
[00:33:48.036 --> 00:33:50.198]  It's all mainstream news.
[00:33:50.198 --> 00:33:52.559]  They report in the New York Times like, is this a problem?
[00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.441]  Eh, maybe not.
[00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:56.362]  They're just mainlining it.
[00:33:56.362 --> 00:34:05.789]  And Twitter, Facebook, and Google working with China have created a global social score that they want to roll out with companies, government, and their systems
[00:34:08.638 --> 00:34:18.426]  Where if you don't comply and go along, it lowers your score where you're literally unhireable.
[00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:25.991]  And face-scanning cameras on the street will alert the general public to who you are for shunning and physical attacks.
[00:34:25.991 --> 00:34:29.454]  This is their science fiction plan.
[00:34:29.454 --> 00:34:32.516]  It's in their WikiLeaks, it's in their admissions.
[00:34:32.516 --> 00:34:38.281]  There it is, China's social credit system will rate how available and how valuable you are as a human.
[00:34:40.785 --> 00:34:44.606]  And then they game that system with supermods and it's over.
[00:34:44.606 --> 00:34:45.626]  This is the plan.
[00:34:45.626 --> 00:35:05.232]  They think you're going to comply with globalism and political correctness, that they're going to ratchet up and up and up, all because you're going to be given access to the internet and access to these internet gulags, these internet ghettos that Matt Drudge coined a few years ago here on the broadcast.
[00:35:08.519 --> 00:35:09.459]  And they're doing it!
[00:35:09.459 --> 00:35:15.140]  And then you go out on the street, and you just look conservative.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:20.181]  It's been on local news here that a gay guy walks out a liberal and gets beat up.
[00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:24.522]  He's a white guy by six black guys saying F Trump.
[00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:26.883]  Or if you're Alex Jones, you really get attacked.
[00:35:26.883 --> 00:35:31.464]  Or if you're the Trump family, or if you're anybody else, you just go out and try to cover their women's march.
[00:35:31.464 --> 00:35:32.344]  They spit at you.
[00:35:32.344 --> 00:35:34.004]  They yell at you.
[00:35:34.004 --> 00:35:36.485]  Men run over and stick their butt out in Millie's face.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.861]  Engage in flatulence.
[00:35:40.861 --> 00:35:56.803]  And it's all arrested development, very cowardly, very babyish, very stunted, very out of shape, very bot-like, very genetic disorder looking.
[00:35:56.803 --> 00:36:05.525]  I don't care if they're black, white, Hispanic, you look at these people, they're ugly, they're stupid, they're hateful,
[00:36:08.669 --> 00:36:12.113]  They truly are twisted.
[00:36:12.113 --> 00:36:14.496]  And then you've got all the women.
[00:36:14.496 --> 00:36:22.425]  They're a mix, but they're there smiling in solidarity, feeling some type of tribal power, because they were given no tribe, no culture.
[00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:26.390]  And so it's women, dressed up like vaginas, humping each other.
[00:36:27.717 --> 00:36:38.626]  And just engaged in bad behavior, you know, naughtiness, weird and naughty, and ignorant young people saying, these people that are here are citizens under DACA.
[00:36:38.626 --> 00:36:39.867]  They have a right to stay.
[00:36:39.867 --> 00:36:42.069]  No, they're not citizens.
[00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:45.912]  I can't go to Mexico or Germany and just become a citizen unless I'm a Muslim.
[00:36:51.138 --> 00:36:54.319]  Childless cat ladies start cult against reality and Trump.
[00:36:54.319 --> 00:36:55.500]  You know, there's one of the videos.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:55.940]  Here's the deal.
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.481]  We've got to take like 50 or 60, 70 of these videos.
[00:36:58.481 --> 00:36:59.021]  I'm not kidding.
[00:36:59.021 --> 00:37:00.061]  It's probably 70 or 80.
[00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:02.842]  It might be 100.
[00:37:02.842 --> 00:37:04.143]  And they're all incredible.
[00:37:04.143 --> 00:37:05.463]  And we've got to boil them down.
[00:37:05.463 --> 00:37:12.866]  The problem is you'll watch a 15 minute video and it gets more and more and more and more and more insane.
[00:37:12.866 --> 00:37:20.749]  Women dressed up as giant vaginas with sex toys hanging out of them, running around
[00:37:25.458 --> 00:37:28.481]  Acting insane.
[00:37:28.481 --> 00:37:30.203]  Because that's all this is.
[00:37:30.203 --> 00:37:31.964]  It's not even street art, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:31.964 --> 00:37:35.067]  All right, that's enough of that.
[00:37:35.067 --> 00:37:37.149]  Let me start getting to some of these clips.
[00:37:37.149 --> 00:37:38.330]  It's just that they're here.
[00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.331]  The censorship is here.
[00:37:39.331 --> 00:37:40.793]  It's all happening.
[00:37:40.793 --> 00:37:44.016]  And then here's the BBC.
[00:37:44.016 --> 00:37:47.339]  Fascist fighters are criminals on the streets of Portland's Antifa group.
[00:37:48.649 --> 00:37:58.455]  And then it says they physically attack people first, they call them Nazis if you're a conservative, libertarian, or Christian, and they basically say in the report that they're good people.
[00:37:58.455 --> 00:37:59.576]  Here's another one.
[00:37:59.576 --> 00:38:03.979]  Europe moves ahead with internet censorship enforcement as more platforms join.
[00:38:03.979 --> 00:38:10.183]  I've got all these news articles here, I've got all of these reports, and I can't find my video list.
[00:38:10.183 --> 00:38:10.843]  Here it is.
[00:38:10.843 --> 00:38:12.965]  So let me, without further ado, start getting to some of these videos.
[00:38:14.383 --> 00:38:16.990]  The ones we've been able to bleep the cuss words out of.
[00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:22.122]  Here's rabid Trump supporter swings and spits on female reporter.
[00:38:23.717 --> 00:38:25.898]  No, I'm asking the Infowars man.
[00:38:25.898 --> 00:38:27.139]  What is a humanoid?
[00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:27.939]  You.
[00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:28.939]  What is a humanoid?
[00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:29.840]  I would say probably you.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.300]  What is the definition of a humanoid?
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.041]  Someone like you.
[00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:34.262]  What is the definition of a humanoid?
[00:38:34.262 --> 00:38:35.962]  An ignorant dumbass like you.
[00:38:35.962 --> 00:38:38.043]  An ignorant dumbass like me.
[00:38:38.043 --> 00:38:41.205]  Do you know what ignorant means?
[00:38:41.205 --> 00:38:46.207]  Ignorant means unaware of knowledge or lacking of a comprehensive attention.
[00:38:47.047 --> 00:38:49.148]  I'm asking you what that is.
[00:38:49.148 --> 00:38:49.748]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:38:49.748 --> 00:38:50.529]  You're just a drunk.
[00:38:50.529 --> 00:38:51.969]  Look at this f***ing guy.
[00:38:51.969 --> 00:38:55.451]  Now he wants to get loud because he's getting pissed.
[00:38:55.451 --> 00:38:56.311]  I'm so mad.
[00:38:56.311 --> 00:38:56.691]  F*** you.
[00:38:56.691 --> 00:38:57.992]  Look at how mad I am.
[00:38:57.992 --> 00:38:59.993]  F*** you.
[00:38:59.993 --> 00:39:01.453]  I feel bad for you.
[00:39:01.453 --> 00:39:02.334]  I feel bad for you.
[00:39:02.334 --> 00:39:03.614]  I feel bad for your f***ing children.
[00:39:03.614 --> 00:39:04.975]  You're literally foaming at the mouth.
[00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:06.095]  I feel bad for your children.
[00:39:06.095 --> 00:39:07.076]  You look like a rabid dog.
[00:39:07.076 --> 00:39:10.157]  You're foaming at the mouth because people like you are f***ing pigs.
[00:39:10.157 --> 00:39:11.898]  And you're everything that's wrong with America.
[00:39:12.918 --> 00:39:15.659]  You don't have a degree in ****.
[00:39:41.974 --> 00:39:43.216]  You're a fake poser!
[00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:44.679]  You're a poser!
[00:39:44.679 --> 00:39:45.260]  Hold this.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:45.601]  Hold this.
[00:39:45.601 --> 00:39:46.642]  He spits on Daria.
[00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:01.589]  This is amazing.
[00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:03.530]  So they're chanting, lock him up.
[00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:04.170]  Here's the funny thing.
[00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:12.132]  If they lock Trump up, the economy would crash, the stock market would crash, the borders would be wide open, and America would become a third world nation.
[00:40:12.132 --> 00:40:12.913]  And that's what they want.
[00:40:14.173 --> 00:40:15.434]  That's what they want!
[00:40:15.434 --> 00:40:16.375]  It's incredible!
[00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:17.857]  You realize you're an idiot, right?
[00:40:17.857 --> 00:40:19.018]  What did I say that's wrong, sir?
[00:40:19.018 --> 00:40:21.300]  I don't really care what you said that's wrong.
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.782]  My point is that you're an idiot.
[00:40:22.782 --> 00:40:25.785]  So you have no facts to base your statement?
[00:40:25.785 --> 00:40:29.749]  That is absolutely not what I said, and you're distorting it into what sucks.
[00:40:29.749 --> 00:40:31.971]  You called me an idiot for no reason.
[00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:32.812]  There he goes!
[00:40:32.812 --> 00:40:33.773]  There he goes!
[00:40:33.773 --> 00:40:34.854]  Yeah, there I go.
[00:40:34.854 --> 00:40:35.394]  There he goes!
[00:40:35.394 --> 00:40:35.835]  There he goes!
[00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:38.760]  I'm not going to do anything.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.321]  Because you're a coward.
[00:40:40.321 --> 00:40:41.602]  Weren't you about to run away?
[00:40:41.602 --> 00:40:44.585]  No, I was about to leave because I don't really feel like listening to a**holes like you.
[00:40:44.585 --> 00:40:47.387]  If you want to put that on the air, put that on the air.
[00:40:47.387 --> 00:40:48.067]  Will do.
[00:40:48.067 --> 00:40:48.427]  Will do.
[00:40:48.427 --> 00:40:50.029]  Thank you for that content.
[00:40:50.029 --> 00:40:53.591]  Don't worry son, you can do better than your father.
[00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:55.933]  This is the drag.
[00:40:55.933 --> 00:40:57.594]  Wow.
[00:40:57.594 --> 00:40:58.335]  That was incredible.
[00:40:58.335 --> 00:41:00.997]  No, but I mean seriously.
[00:41:00.997 --> 00:41:02.698]  Trump becomes president.
[00:41:02.698 --> 00:41:04.439]  All the stock markets hit record highs.
[00:41:06.972 --> 00:41:08.972]  I need to get to the next clip.
[00:41:08.972 --> 00:41:11.113]  It's so out of control.
[00:41:11.113 --> 00:41:14.114]  There's hours of this.
[00:41:14.114 --> 00:41:19.035]  Hour after hour of frothing violent people that try to slap him and spit on him.
[00:41:19.035 --> 00:41:21.955]  And they talk about fighting hate and all this stuff.
[00:41:21.955 --> 00:41:25.396]  And they're just like Nazis who project hate.
[00:41:25.396 --> 00:41:27.136]  And a lot of them don't even know who Owen is.
[00:41:27.136 --> 00:41:30.697]  They don't see the flag on our microphone in Four Wars.
[00:41:30.697 --> 00:41:33.118]  They see the American flag hat.
[00:41:33.118 --> 00:41:34.418]  And that alone they hate.
[00:41:36.189 --> 00:41:40.752]  People are walking by, by the thousands, and they see the American flag, and they hate it.
[00:41:40.752 --> 00:41:42.713]  These people are the literal scum of the earth.
[00:41:42.713 --> 00:41:45.635]  They think America is a you-know-what hole.
[00:41:45.635 --> 00:41:46.435]  Must see.
[00:41:46.435 --> 00:41:48.516]  Cringeworthy outtakes of Millie's speech.
[00:41:48.516 --> 00:41:50.738]  Let's play the guy farting on her.
[00:41:50.738 --> 00:41:51.778]  Here it is.
[00:41:51.778 --> 00:41:54.200]  How's this?
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.080]  Is he gonna fart?
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.942]  You farted at me?
[00:41:56.942 --> 00:41:57.822]  He farted at me!
[00:41:57.822 --> 00:41:58.643]  That's real audio.
[00:41:58.643 --> 00:41:59.863]  Oh my god.
[00:41:59.863 --> 00:42:01.264]  An old man and his wife.
[00:42:01.264 --> 00:42:02.285]  They're all about being babies.
[00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:07.031]  Alright, let's just stop right here.
[00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:09.032]  And again, everybody's like arrested development.
[00:42:09.032 --> 00:42:10.452]  They're all like mental patients.
[00:42:10.452 --> 00:42:13.153]  They're in a mental patient delusional cult.
[00:42:13.153 --> 00:42:15.354]  These are the losers!
[00:42:15.354 --> 00:42:20.095]  And they hate the recovery, and they hate our military, and they just hate everything.
[00:42:20.095 --> 00:42:26.097]  It is absolutely dangerous what a free society has created, because it's created all these spoiled rotten babies.
[00:42:26.097 --> 00:42:27.397]  And imagine the millennials.
[00:42:27.397 --> 00:42:29.358]  It's going to get worse, and worse, and worse.
[00:42:30.712 --> 00:42:32.574]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:32.574 --> 00:42:33.995]  Please support the broadcast.
[00:42:33.995 --> 00:42:35.176]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:35.176 --> 00:42:38.859]  We've got the combo deal that's got to end the next few days.
[00:42:38.859 --> 00:42:41.641]  We're running out of X2 and Secret 12.
[00:42:41.641 --> 00:42:44.464]  The Infowars Life Core Combo.
[00:42:44.464 --> 00:42:47.046]  X2 and a Secret 12, 40% off.
[00:42:47.046 --> 00:42:50.369]  Infowarslife.com or AAA2533139.
[00:42:50.369 --> 00:42:52.971]  And don't forget Pollen Block.
[00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:56.094]  I was having a huge pollen attack until I took two of them earlier.
[00:42:58.496 --> 00:42:59.297]  I'm so excited.
[00:42:59.297 --> 00:43:09.443]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:09.443 --> 00:43:17.969]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:17.969 --> 00:43:26.755]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:28.837 --> 00:43:48.423]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:48.423 --> 00:43:51.103]  It is amazing!
[00:43:51.103 --> 00:43:56.065]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:43:59.878 --> 00:44:18.289]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:24.573]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:44:24.573 --> 00:44:25.354]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:44:25.354 --> 00:44:28.496]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:44:29.156 --> 00:44:30.697]  And so much more.
[00:44:30.697 --> 00:44:32.058]  It is concentrated.
[00:44:32.058 --> 00:44:33.799]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:39.603]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:44:39.603 --> 00:44:40.804]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:44:40.804 --> 00:44:42.825]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:44:42.825 --> 00:44:45.427]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:44:45.427 --> 00:44:46.848]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:44:46.848 --> 00:44:49.229]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:44:49.229 --> 00:44:49.930]  Immune Wall.
[00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.371]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:51.371 --> 00:44:52.531]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[00:45:02.328 --> 00:45:13.834]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[00:45:13.834 --> 00:45:14.735]  This is pollen blood.
[00:45:15.735 --> 00:45:28.401]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy, watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[00:45:28.401 --> 00:45:32.723]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[00:45:32.723 --> 00:45:36.745]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet.
[00:45:37.205 --> 00:45:47.292]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[00:45:47.292 --> 00:45:50.434]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.

[00:47:01.864 --> 00:47:04.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.314 --> 00:47:19.399]  Ladies and gentlemen, live!
[00:47:19.399 --> 00:47:25.734]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:27.139 --> 00:47:29.281]  Well, I told you the Democrats were going to blink.
[00:47:29.281 --> 00:47:36.948]  I said it about 30 minutes ago because the polls show they're getting their little globalist white supremacist tales handed to them.
[00:47:36.948 --> 00:47:38.890]  That's what they really are.
[00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:39.851]  The race baiters.
[00:47:39.851 --> 00:47:40.732]  It just passed.
[00:47:40.732 --> 00:47:41.933]  The government's reopened 78 to 18.
[00:47:41.933 --> 00:47:42.854]  60 votes needed to limit debate.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.140]  Again, that's just some of the vote, though.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.161]  There's usually procedural votes.
[00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:56.362]  But so far, they are blinking and blinking big time.
[00:47:56.362 --> 00:48:00.122]  We'll continue to follow this because there's a lot of weird procedural stuff.
[00:48:00.122 --> 00:48:06.224]  And I've been busy covering all the censorship and globalism and Trump about to go to Davos and all the rest of it.
[00:48:06.224 --> 00:48:09.745]  But that's government funding through February 8th.
[00:48:09.745 --> 00:48:12.005]  And of course, this will probably all start back over again.
[00:48:12.005 --> 00:48:13.505]  But yes, it's 78.
[00:48:13.505 --> 00:48:13.905]  No, it's 18.
[00:48:17.266 --> 00:48:18.807]  Needed to limit debate.
[00:48:18.807 --> 00:48:20.287]  And I think that's just the debate.
[00:48:20.287 --> 00:48:21.628]  To limit debate.
[00:48:21.628 --> 00:48:23.489]  I believe the vote's still going forward.
[00:48:23.489 --> 00:48:25.370]  Let's check that right now.
[00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.651]  Let's not count our chickens till they're hatched, but that's so far.
[00:48:27.651 --> 00:48:29.251]  In fact, they're not extending debate.
[00:48:29.251 --> 00:48:30.772]  Looks like they're choking.
[00:48:30.772 --> 00:48:33.493]  And the word is, people are really seeing through this.
[00:48:33.493 --> 00:48:40.836]  So we're gonna watch this as it unfolds, but Schumer off to the side looks very, very pleased, so we'll just see this as it goes forward.
[00:48:40.836 --> 00:48:41.957]  What a joke.
[00:48:41.957 --> 00:48:45.098]  Oh, by the way, the ultimate plug here, and then I'm gonna get back to the news.
[00:48:47.307 --> 00:48:52.731]  I don't like taking Zyrtec-D or Claritin-D for seasonal discomfort, all the pollen.
[00:48:52.731 --> 00:48:56.493]  In Texas right now, they have the mountain juniper, they call it cedar.
[00:48:56.493 --> 00:48:57.694]  That's the redneck term for it.
[00:48:57.694 --> 00:49:00.016]  There's literally clouds of yellow flying around.
[00:49:00.016 --> 00:49:02.397]  It makes me sneeze, I've had headaches, you name it.
[00:49:02.397 --> 00:49:09.282]  Well, I didn't bring a bottle of pollen block home over the weekend, and the trees really dropped this weekend, so it went from medium to extremely high.
[00:49:11.038 --> 00:49:21.203]  And I'm sitting here, before the show, having a total allergy attack, and Zach, one of the great crew goes, Alex, pollen block.
[00:49:21.203 --> 00:49:23.104]  Only takes about 45 minutes to kick in.
[00:49:23.104 --> 00:49:24.264]  Help me last week.
[00:49:24.264 --> 00:49:25.605]  I went, of course.
[00:49:25.605 --> 00:49:30.067]  Got the bottle of pollen block, chewed up two of the tablets in my mouth, and
[00:49:32.386 --> 00:49:35.308]  My allergy attack is 90% gone.
[00:49:35.308 --> 00:49:37.410]  And some would say, well that's because you came back inside.
[00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:37.710]  Don't know.
[00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:40.292]  Once this thing kicks off, it kicks off.
[00:49:40.292 --> 00:49:42.453]  It's major league alleviated.
[00:49:42.453 --> 00:49:46.756]  Because last week I was having issues and when I started taking it every day.
[00:49:46.756 --> 00:49:47.317]  Incredible!
[00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:48.097]  Here's the great thing.
[00:49:48.097 --> 00:49:49.919]  It doesn't make you feel like you're on speed.
[00:49:51.547 --> 00:50:02.637]  Doesn't make me bounce off the walls more than I naturally do, because it's Japanese quail, fed a secret diet that the French discovered decades ago, now patented, and we've secured it.
[00:50:02.637 --> 00:50:04.459]  We're bringing it to you at a discounted price.
[00:50:04.459 --> 00:50:08.703]  Seasonal discomfort formula, pollen block.
[00:50:08.703 --> 00:50:09.864]  It's 51% off, technically, because it's $17.76.
[00:50:09.864 --> 00:50:10.445]  Great deal for $34.95.
[00:50:10.445 --> 00:50:10.545]  It's $17.76.
[00:50:17.372 --> 00:50:23.757]  This is an amazing product and almost everyone that uses it gives it five stars.
[00:50:23.757 --> 00:50:30.562]  It is, in so many studies, up against all sorts of toxic stuff, it just blows them away.
[00:50:32.077 --> 00:50:33.598]  And there's a bunch of science behind it.
[00:50:33.598 --> 00:50:39.081]  I'm going to cut and add one of those actual scientists and experts on it, on what it does to the histamines.
[00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:41.783]  But these birds are just in the pollen.
[00:50:41.783 --> 00:50:43.944]  They're in all the allergens.
[00:50:43.944 --> 00:50:45.885]  They're just out there immersed in it.
[00:50:45.885 --> 00:50:48.127]  And whatever's going on when they eat a certain diet,
[00:50:50.376 --> 00:50:51.516]  It's secret.
[00:50:51.516 --> 00:50:52.477]  It's all proprietary.
[00:50:52.477 --> 00:50:54.217]  We don't even know what it is.
[00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:57.358]  When you do that, you don't just eat quail eggs and get this.
[00:50:57.358 --> 00:51:03.179]  It's got to be a Japanese quail, and it's got to be a special diet, and it's incredible.
[00:51:03.179 --> 00:51:09.861]  And they just found, locals found, people eating it in France no longer got the hay fever.
[00:51:09.861 --> 00:51:12.081]  So it's amazing what God's given us.
[00:51:12.081 --> 00:51:13.001]  Pollen Block.
[00:51:13.001 --> 00:51:15.362]  Infowarslife.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:51:15.362 --> 00:51:19.463]  Now this is going to end up being a huge bestseller because
[00:51:20.481 --> 00:51:21.161]  It works for me.
[00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:29.584]  A bunch of the crew, you know, have the seasonal discomfort issues with all the dust and the rest of it, and it has just annihilated it.
[00:51:29.584 --> 00:51:30.945]  My nose is running like a faucet.
[00:51:30.945 --> 00:51:32.505]  I sneezed 15 times driving here.
[00:51:32.505 --> 00:51:34.646]  I was sneezing in the studio.
[00:51:34.646 --> 00:51:38.087]  They go, and I'm like, oh, I'm not going to take Claritin, because it works too.
[00:51:39.861 --> 00:51:40.782]  But it makes me a jerk.
[00:51:40.782 --> 00:51:42.263]  And they go, dude, pollen block.
[00:51:42.263 --> 00:51:46.868]  It's like I just have to get used to actually taking what God gave us.
[00:51:46.868 --> 00:51:51.532]  Because when I take the X2, when I take the Secret 12, I took the Secret 12 this morning.
[00:51:51.532 --> 00:51:55.055]  When I do that, I have so much energy, so much more stamina, so much more focus.
[00:51:55.055 --> 00:51:57.438]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[00:51:57.438 --> 00:51:58.579]  Also, Alexa, pure breeze.
[00:51:59.665 --> 00:52:05.771]  It is a four-stage filter, ionizer, HEPA, you name it, with submarine technology.
[00:52:05.771 --> 00:52:10.155]  When I bought these for my house six, seven years ago, they were $800, another brand that isn't even as good.
[00:52:10.155 --> 00:52:13.118]  Now they've all dropped as a miniaturization in factories to about $500.
[00:52:13.118 --> 00:52:17.943]  Well, this is normally $200 and is a great deal.
[00:52:17.943 --> 00:52:22.487]  $50 off with free shipping for a limited time only at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:52:24.383 --> 00:52:26.364]  So not 50% off, $50 off, excuse me.
[00:52:26.364 --> 00:52:26.805]  $50 off?
[00:52:26.805 --> 00:52:28.246]  I was saying, wow, we can't do that.
[00:52:28.246 --> 00:52:31.188]  We don't even make 50% on it.
[00:52:31.188 --> 00:52:34.230]  When we sell it for $198, I think we make like $50.
[00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:36.111]  But it's $50 off.
[00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:37.713]  I guess they're doing a lost leader.
[00:52:37.713 --> 00:52:39.454]  So that's the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:52:39.454 --> 00:52:40.755]  I can't believe that deal's so good.
[00:52:40.755 --> 00:52:41.776]  I didn't even approve that.
[00:52:41.776 --> 00:52:42.996]  I'm just looking at this.
[00:52:42.996 --> 00:52:45.979]  I guess the factory producer must have given us a good deal or something.
[00:52:45.979 --> 00:52:47.520]  I've never seen a deal that good. $149.
[00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:56.883]  You know, when we first started to promote this a couple years ago, it was $300, and it was a great deal at $300.
[00:52:56.883 --> 00:53:00.686]  But it's just that cost is going down with technology, as everybody knows.
[00:53:00.686 --> 00:53:02.347]  Unless it's an iPhone.
[00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:03.267]  Those are like $1,000 now.
[00:53:03.267 --> 00:53:04.948]  It's all just a scam.
[00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:12.572]  But anyways, Alexa, Pure Breeze, InfowarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:53:12.572 --> 00:53:15.014]  Now, before I go any further, I've got to get to some more of these clips here.
[00:53:16.189 --> 00:53:17.170]  Joel Gilbert's going to join us.
[00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:20.311]  We're going to play some excerpts of his new film, The Art of the Insult.
[00:53:20.311 --> 00:53:22.312]  He's an expert on communists and globalists.
[00:53:22.312 --> 00:53:26.394]  We're going to get into Antifa, all the rest of it, and take some of your calls next hour.
[00:53:26.394 --> 00:53:27.794]  We're going to continue.
[00:53:27.794 --> 00:53:29.135]  Government funding through February 8.
[00:53:29.135 --> 00:53:30.976]  60 votes needed to limit debate.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.562]  So I believe that is a vote to limit debate, and then they're going to have the main vote.
[00:53:35.562 --> 00:53:36.342]  But I may be wrong.
[00:53:36.342 --> 00:53:39.403]  I'll check during the break and give you the exact analysis.
[00:53:39.403 --> 00:53:40.284]  But that's ongoing.
[00:53:40.284 --> 00:53:42.525]  We're going to follow that as that goes.
[00:53:42.525 --> 00:53:47.907]  Let's go ahead and play Soy Lattes Litter Streets after Women's March.
[00:53:47.907 --> 00:53:53.890]  Again, this is a drug deployed by, like there's good stuff in Mother Nature, there's bad stuff.
[00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.991]  It's not just regular soy.
[00:53:55.991 --> 00:53:58.992]  These big companies, particularly to make you addicted,
[00:54:01.277 --> 00:54:06.601]  Of course, it's out of Seattle and the whole global feminization program of males.
[00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:11.606]  They take soybeans and crush the whole thing in a process, turning it into sludge.
[00:54:11.606 --> 00:54:14.288]  You're not supposed to eat the core of a soybean.
[00:54:14.288 --> 00:54:20.533]  So, again, they're eating the cores of soybeans the way it's processed, which is pure estrogen.
[00:54:20.533 --> 00:54:25.437]  And the men admit they're addicted, they freak out, I mean, it's incredible.
[00:54:25.437 --> 00:54:28.480]  Women that drink it can't get pregnant, so it's really targeting them.
[00:54:29.684 --> 00:54:30.987]  Okay, it blocks fertility.
[00:54:30.987 --> 00:54:33.273]  First thing they'll tell you is get off soy products.
[00:54:33.273 --> 00:54:34.516]  Bunch of other stuff.
[00:54:34.516 --> 00:54:35.338]  And get on iodine.
[00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:37.202]  That's the major studies.
[00:54:37.202 --> 00:54:37.744]  Real iodine.
[00:54:38.956 --> 00:54:44.278]  But with men, it just whacks them out, man, and they're bouncing up and down off the walls.
[00:54:44.278 --> 00:54:49.081]  And there's just thousands of these cups, hundreds, where she's at, and it's all soy latte, soy.
[00:54:49.081 --> 00:54:52.922]  She reads on the side, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, because they made it pretty.
[00:54:52.922 --> 00:54:55.924]  They go, drink the soy, liberal.
[00:54:55.924 --> 00:54:59.345]  And then they all run out.
[00:54:59.345 --> 00:55:01.646]  And then once they've done it, they like it.
[00:55:01.646 --> 00:55:02.467]  So let's go ahead and show it.
[00:55:03.306 --> 00:55:12.932]  I find it a bit ironic that after the Los Angeles Woman's March, the streets are littered with empty soy latte cups.
[00:55:12.932 --> 00:55:13.913]  That's right.
[00:55:13.913 --> 00:55:17.915]  Tons of Starbucks and other coffee cups littering the floor.
[00:55:17.915 --> 00:55:18.956]  It's kind of funny.
[00:55:18.956 --> 00:55:21.998]  Notice what a bunch of dirty pigs these people are.
[00:55:21.998 --> 00:55:27.701]  If you go to a conservative rally, it looks like the military policed the area with a fine-tubed comb on average.
[00:55:27.701 --> 00:55:29.963]  Hey, pick that up!
[00:55:29.963 --> 00:55:30.383]  Just saying.
[00:55:31.596 --> 00:55:34.299]  But these pigs use it's antiphysites.
[00:55:34.299 --> 00:55:36.701]  That's, that's, that's the antiphysite.
[00:55:36.701 --> 00:55:38.123]  You know, that's the full page you have in the New York Times.
[00:55:38.123 --> 00:55:39.664]  They're just littering everywhere.
[00:55:39.664 --> 00:55:41.346]  Trash everywhere.
[00:55:41.346 --> 00:55:44.609]  And just look at these people.
[00:55:44.609 --> 00:55:47.532]  They look like people escaped out of a mental institution.
[00:55:47.532 --> 00:55:48.233]  Let's go back to them.
[00:55:48.575 --> 00:56:05.371]  It's ironic when all these feminist liberals are pushing for climate change and that the world is so populated that we all need to restrict our behaviors and daily tasks when they can't even make the effort to throw away their coffee cups or their resist Trump signs.
[00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:12.939]  But notice also that soy lattes have been linked with having estrogen mimickers and high amounts of it.
[00:56:13.679 --> 00:56:26.385]  The theme here is that we see all of these empty soy latte cups here when we had this ultra-feminine, feminist, anti-masculine, anti-patriarchy march here.
[00:56:26.385 --> 00:56:35.229]  It's no wonder that you saw women dancing around in vagina costumes, rubbing up against each other, that you saw extremely effeminate men
[00:56:35.489 --> 00:56:36.329]  What, like Haiti?
[00:56:36.329 --> 00:56:36.630]  A crap hole?
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:12.742]  We got a bunch of poor people that just... If there's two cows, go ahead and just kill them and have meat tonight.
[00:57:12.742 --> 00:57:14.343]  Don't let them breed.
[00:57:14.343 --> 00:57:17.904]  Don't have 50 cows and then have meat all the time.
[00:57:17.904 --> 00:57:19.404]  And just cut down all the trees.
[00:57:19.404 --> 00:57:21.165]  The Dominican Republic's right next door.
[00:57:21.165 --> 00:57:25.606]  Gorgeous, beautiful, incredible.
[00:57:25.606 --> 00:57:33.489]  And then right over the border, Haiti is deforested in a hellhole and its population's even lower because everybody stabs everybody in the back.
[00:57:35.526 --> 00:57:38.990]  I mean, their national religion is devil worship.
[00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:42.493]  The devil doesn't deliver, folks.
[00:57:42.493 --> 00:57:43.814]  The devil's for losers.
[00:57:43.814 --> 00:57:44.575]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:44.575 --> 00:57:45.076]  Stay with us.
[00:57:48.075 --> 00:57:55.539]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:57:55.539 --> 00:58:08.765]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:58:09.705 --> 00:58:21.595]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:58:21.595 --> 00:58:27.560]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:37.328]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[00:58:37.328 --> 00:58:45.496]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:58:49.702 --> 00:58:52.304]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[00:58:52.304 --> 00:59:06.895]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:59:06.895 --> 00:59:14.501]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:59:15.021 --> 00:59:26.146]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:59:26.146 --> 00:59:32.409]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[00:59:32.409 --> 00:59:34.830]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:42.415]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:59:42.415 --> 00:59:51.861]  That is the new Shard of the Mind, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:54.523]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.699 --> 01:00:11.446]  Alright, we're coming back on the vote in the Senate to turn the government back on.
[01:00:11.446 --> 01:00:12.928]  That's still ongoing.
[01:00:12.928 --> 01:00:16.735]  But right now, let's go to this powerful John Bowne report that's absolutely critical.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.002]  Well, it's after midnight and the votes weren't there to keep the government running.
[01:00:21.002 --> 01:00:24.563]  It's been roughly five years since the government shut down.
[01:00:24.563 --> 01:00:37.829]  The Democrats point their fingers at the Republicans, demanding the protection of non-citizen, non-tax-paying DACA dreamers, while American tax-paying citizens are the ones who will be left in the cold.
[01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:42.311]  I really believe that one week from now, we will have DACA on the books.
[01:00:42.311 --> 01:00:45.212]  They held all this hostage.
[01:00:47.014 --> 01:00:49.336]  All of it hostage.
[01:00:49.336 --> 01:00:55.463]  Over the completely unrelated issue of illegal immigration.
[01:00:55.463 --> 01:00:59.246]  It's almost as if you were rooting for a shutdown.
[01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:01.188]  And now we'll have one.
[01:01:01.188 --> 01:01:06.554]  And the blame should crash entirely on President Trump's shoulders.
[01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:12.592]  This will be called the Trump shutdown.
[01:01:12.592 --> 01:01:17.215]  As the White House just indicated, the President's not going to talk about the issue at all while the government's shut down.
[01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:18.775]  He made it quite clear.
[01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:29.400]  He said, when Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders, we'll reopen negotiations on immigration reform.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:36.324]  So this particular strategy has eliminated the possibility of getting a signature on the thing that shut the government down over.
[01:01:39.136 --> 01:01:42.918]  Anybody explain to me this strategy?
[01:01:42.918 --> 01:01:44.018]  I'm perplexed.
[01:01:44.018 --> 01:01:46.079]  Underlying the shutdown mess?
[01:01:46.079 --> 01:01:47.100]  The release?
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.400]  The memo movement?
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:59.305]  Rolling Stone has ridiculed the suspicion of corruption, writing, The memo in question is a confidential four-page document assembled by a stealthy group of House Republicans
[01:01:59.565 --> 01:02:08.327]  Led by Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes, over the past month, surprisingly enough, they seem to have found what they set out to find.
[01:02:08.327 --> 01:02:17.470]  Judging, at least, from the dark and hysterical hints about the contents of the memo that right-wingers in Congress began to issue last evening.
[01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:20.691]  And the Mockingbird Media continues to stir that pot.
[01:02:21.051 --> 01:02:27.996]  This meme that's breaking my Twitter feed this morning, what is this memo that you guys are selling as so significant?
[01:02:27.996 --> 01:02:39.724]  It's a meaningful event, I'm telling you, and it's so important to me and other members that not only members of Congress, but that we declassify as best we can this information and provide it to you.
[01:02:39.724 --> 01:02:42.026]  What kind of information is it?
[01:02:42.026 --> 01:02:46.289]  It's primarily dealing with the Department of Justice and FBI, and imagining this,
[01:02:47.678 --> 01:02:55.307]  Did they propose or provide information to the FISA courts and was that information accurate?
[01:02:55.307 --> 01:02:56.608]  That's the essence of this.
[01:02:56.608 --> 01:03:03.676]  So you believe you have proof that a judge allowed warrants in violation of the legal standard for those warrants?
[01:03:04.256 --> 01:03:06.217]  I'm not going to elaborate on it other than that.
[01:03:06.217 --> 01:03:07.737]  It's a pretty loaded suggestion though.
[01:03:07.737 --> 01:03:10.679]  I mean, this is a big, this is huge, but I can't tell you why.
[01:03:10.679 --> 01:03:21.683]  Meanwhile, the inertia from those so-called dark and hysterical hints are gaining momentum as the concern over the contents of the four-page classified memo intensifies.
[01:03:22.223 --> 01:03:29.388]  And particularly the authentication processes that are laid out in the memo are of such fiction.
[01:03:29.388 --> 01:03:34.092]  They are so laughable that they would never withstand scrutiny from the public.
[01:03:34.092 --> 01:03:40.677]  And what I'm worried about is that the cast of characters identified in this memo is not a group of people who are gone.
[01:03:41.397 --> 01:03:43.918]  Many of these people are still in our government.
[01:03:43.918 --> 01:03:47.841]  They still wield influence, and that's why we've got to get this information out in public.
[01:03:47.841 --> 01:03:51.563]  But you just said people will be fired at the FBI and Department of Justice, right?
[01:03:51.563 --> 01:03:52.563]  And possibly worse.
[01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:59.147]  I think that there could be people who could face criminal consequences as a result of the activities that are laid out in this memo.
[01:03:59.147 --> 01:04:07.431]  And it's easy to see after reading this memo why Senator Grassley and why Senator Graham wanted to refer this matter for criminal prosecution.
[01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:10.473]  By releasing the memo and releasing the file,
[01:04:12.728 --> 01:04:19.491]  What it would reveal is the Fed's reliance on bad sources and methods.
[01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:23.053]  The American public deserves the truth.
[01:04:23.053 --> 01:04:24.874]  We should not hide the truth from them.
[01:04:24.874 --> 01:04:26.375]  They've waited too long.
[01:04:27.694 --> 01:04:29.715]  Do not pull a wool over their eyes.
[01:04:29.715 --> 01:04:31.415]  Show them the facts.
[01:04:31.415 --> 01:04:32.696]  They deserve nothing less.
[01:04:32.696 --> 01:04:40.018]  The Democrats will now thumb their nose at what they perceive as President Trump and the Republicans' failure to lead.
[01:04:40.018 --> 01:04:46.101]  A champion in rallying those forces is our distinguished majority for the moment.
[01:04:51.038 --> 01:05:00.880]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.541]  But instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:10.102]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:05:10.102 --> 01:05:13.242]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:16.343]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:05:17.864 --> 01:05:30.693]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:45.763]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:05:46.763 --> 01:05:51.027]  Find out for yourself today at Infowarsstore.com what it can do for you and your family.
[01:05:51.027 --> 01:05:52.768]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:05:52.768 --> 01:05:55.030]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:18.779]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:18.779 --> 01:06:22.242]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.242 --> 01:06:23.663]  I'm not a liberal.
[01:06:23.663 --> 01:06:25.786]  I'm not a conservative.
[01:06:25.786 --> 01:06:26.686]  I'm an American.
[01:06:26.686 --> 01:06:27.427]  I'm a father.
[01:06:27.427 --> 01:06:28.949]  I'm a patriot.
[01:06:28.949 --> 01:06:30.350]  I like free market.
[01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:32.652]  I like common sense.
[01:06:32.652 --> 01:06:33.913]  I like living in a free country.
[01:06:34.827 --> 01:06:43.534]  You know, I saw these memes online where they go, Jones loves our military now, but he used to think our military wanted to put us in FEMA camps.
[01:06:43.534 --> 01:06:46.716]  I never said our military was bad or hated us.
[01:06:46.716 --> 01:07:02.448]  I said under Bill Clinton and then under Bush and then under Obama, we got real government memos and documents and training manuals from the military, because they were patriots, where Obama was trying to train the military for gun confiscation.
[01:07:04.028 --> 01:07:07.190]  It was civil unrest!
[01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:17.995]  And two and a half weeks ago we got documents from inside ANIFA and George Soros' foundation that they've not denied are real.
[01:07:17.995 --> 01:07:20.377]  Where it said we're going to cause a civil war.
[01:07:20.377 --> 01:07:26.900]  We're going to stir up a race war in America so Obama can declare martial law in 2015, but that failed.
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.602]  Then I got full page ads they put in the New York Times saying we're going to resist, we're going to drive Trump out.
[01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:46.363]  And I see them trying to sabotage our economy in front of everybody in a big way.
[01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:51.549]  And we go out to their rallies in Austin and Los Angeles and in New York this weekend.
[01:07:54.431 --> 01:08:14.393]  We've probably got close to a hundred videos on Infowars.com of men spitting on women at women's marches, at men running over and farting on Millie Weaver with their wives, acting, I mean we're talking like ripping, like three-year-olds, and everyone acting like lobotomized children
[01:08:18.362 --> 01:08:21.385]  Running around, screaming, yelling, going nuts.
[01:08:21.385 --> 01:08:26.769]  And I've asked Kit, one of the other great crew members, I guess Kit's in New York, he's not back yet.
[01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:41.322]  Kit Daniels, somebody to compile the 100 videos or whatever, just to an InfoWars page, where it's just all there, like, you know, the women's march, total insanity, words do not describe it, you've got to see it for yourself.
[01:08:41.322 --> 01:08:44.304]  And we weren't cherry picking, I guess they have posted it, there it is.
[01:08:44.304 --> 01:08:46.046]  We were not cherry picking.
[01:08:49.329 --> 01:08:50.530]  That's just some of them.
[01:08:50.530 --> 01:08:53.073]  I haven't even watched the one where everybody's spraying the guy.
[01:08:53.073 --> 01:08:54.114]  Whatever that is.
[01:08:54.114 --> 01:09:08.248]  And I don't even see the footage here of at night time Antifa attacking everybody and trying to keep people from going into a Patriot event.
[01:09:08.248 --> 01:09:10.511]  And then Chelsea Manning goes in, everybody's nice to her.
[01:09:12.332 --> 01:09:15.333]  And then she comes out and says, I confronted the white supremacist.
[01:09:15.333 --> 01:09:16.414]  It's like make-believe.
[01:09:16.414 --> 01:09:17.394]  It's like LARPing.
[01:09:17.394 --> 01:09:24.398]  It's like, you're a kid and you imagine that your dad's truck is a monster and you're fighting in the front yard with a stick or something.
[01:09:24.398 --> 01:09:28.900]  I mean, it's like, they work for the people that are race-baiting.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.441]  They work for the people that robbed Haiti.
[01:09:31.441 --> 01:09:34.022]  They work for the people that are funding radical Islam to take over.
[01:09:34.022 --> 01:09:37.384]  I mean, they're really bad people.
[01:09:37.384 --> 01:09:39.885]  Hillary Clinton said black people were super predators.
[01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:47.151]  Hillary Clinton praised the Grand Dragon and the KKK, but they don't care.
[01:09:47.151 --> 01:10:04.755]  It's about make-believe, and it's about a club they're in, and it's about them living in this open, free society, almost none of them have jobs, and they march over to our camera people and keep saying, we gotta have DACA, these are citizens, they have a right to be here, there should be no borders!
[01:10:04.755 --> 01:10:08.576]  Explain to us how people that aren't from this country are citizens.
[01:10:08.576 --> 01:10:10.076]  F you, I hope you die.
[01:10:14.415 --> 01:10:14.515]  It's
[01:10:35.014 --> 01:10:35.495]  I don't think so.
[01:10:46.035 --> 01:10:47.736]  And then you see them, you know, driving off in their $100,000 car.
[01:10:47.736 --> 01:10:49.496]  It's not just they're wealthy.
[01:10:49.496 --> 01:10:53.117]  It's like, oh, I publish five books since you asked who I am.
[01:10:53.117 --> 01:10:54.337]  And I got to go.
[01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:56.878]  I'm going to go hang out with some 30-year-old people.
[01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:58.719]  That's what's really going on at school.
[01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:02.720]  So you want to find those people because they're there and they don't want to talk to you.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.840]  Not because they're elitist.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.381]  They just know you're an arrested development person.
[01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:19.330]  I was hanging around with guys that, you know, had already been on four or five tours in the military when I was 16 or 17, because they were fun and they were cool.
[01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:24.113]  I was going to shooting contests, you know, with the police and the FBI when I was 16.
[01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:28.095]  That's what I was doing, just because I was a good shooter, people invited me, that's what I did.
[01:11:28.095 --> 01:11:29.576]  But see, I'm not arrested development.
[01:11:29.576 --> 01:11:32.358]  At 21, I had a syndicated radio show.
[01:11:32.358 --> 01:11:34.259]  By 30, I was on over 100 radio stations.
[01:11:35.472 --> 01:11:42.718]  By 43, I'd help elect the first American restorationist president in history.
[01:11:42.718 --> 01:11:44.579]  And those aren't brags.
[01:11:44.579 --> 01:11:45.320]  It's just fact.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.082]  Who was the famous actor who played Cowboys?
[01:11:48.082 --> 01:11:48.823]  It wasn't John Wayne.
[01:11:48.823 --> 01:11:49.783]  He always distributed.
[01:11:49.783 --> 01:11:51.705]  Who said no brag, just fact?
[01:11:51.705 --> 01:11:52.886]  One of those guys.
[01:11:52.886 --> 01:11:54.547]  And it's not bragging to say this.
[01:11:54.547 --> 01:11:57.169]  This is why we're under attack.
[01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:58.290]  This is why they're after us.
[01:11:58.290 --> 01:11:59.751]  This is why they don't like us.
[01:11:59.751 --> 01:12:00.672]  We're coming back from break.
[01:12:00.672 --> 01:12:03.875]  We're going to Joel Gilbert and his new film that we're selling at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.803]  Trump, the art of the insult, which he does after they attack him and where he uses the name to properly name what they are.
[01:12:10.803 --> 01:12:13.964]  Sloppy Steve.
[01:12:13.964 --> 01:12:17.606]  Crooked Hillary.
[01:12:17.606 --> 01:12:19.166]  It's powerful.
[01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:20.847]  It's a must-see.
[01:12:20.847 --> 01:12:22.328]  It's coming up.
[01:12:22.328 --> 01:12:25.469]  It's at Infowarstore.com.
[01:12:25.469 --> 01:12:29.651]  But before we go back to our guest here, I wanted to just go ahead and get to one other clip here.
[01:12:31.519 --> 01:12:32.740]  As they prepare to have the vote.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:34.281]  They've already had a vote to limit debate.
[01:12:34.281 --> 01:12:36.803]  Now they're grandstanding, the Democrats are.
[01:12:36.803 --> 01:12:37.683]  We'll see what happens.
[01:12:37.683 --> 01:12:44.188]  But I thought we should play this clip by Jeff Greenfield.
[01:12:44.188 --> 01:12:48.031]  When I watch CNN, I expect indictment of Trump to be imminent.
[01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:51.754]  CNN reporter admits no one cares about Russia conspiracy theory.
[01:12:51.754 --> 01:12:54.816]  And so now that Zucker is out, as of last week, we broke that and told you.
[01:12:54.816 --> 01:12:57.378]  Roger Stone told you he will be gone by January.
[01:12:57.378 --> 01:12:59.299]  Said that four months ago.
[01:12:59.299 --> 01:13:00.220]  Next year's news today.
[01:13:02.037 --> 01:13:03.998]  CNN has wrecked itself doing this.
[01:13:03.998 --> 01:13:11.319]  So you're going to see a little more sanity come in now that Zucker is gone.
[01:13:11.319 --> 01:13:20.962]  So now they're not going to be fired if they don't say he's a Russian agent, Alex Jones is a Russian agent, George Soros murdered Hitler himself when he was a Nazi collaborator.
[01:13:20.962 --> 01:13:26.783]  I mean, that's the type of, you know, upside down world stuff they're putting out.
[01:13:26.783 --> 01:13:28.104]  So here is Jeff Greenwald.
[01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:28.824]  Here's part of that clip.
[01:13:29.744 --> 01:13:39.647]  Well, you know, I remember talking years ago to a United States Senator who would go home and watch Keith Olbermann when he was on MSNBC beating up Bush.
[01:13:39.647 --> 01:13:41.728]  And I said, why do you do that?
[01:13:41.728 --> 01:13:44.249]  And I was told it's like sinking into a nice warm bath.
[01:13:45.049 --> 01:13:50.451]  And I think on both sides of the divide, people are sinking into nice warm baths to reconfirm what they believe.
[01:13:50.451 --> 01:14:04.054]  I mean, the idea that, you know, when I watch CNN sometimes, you know, I think, I expect the indictment on Donald Trump to be imminent because the focus on Russian collusion and that issue is very strong.
[01:14:04.054 --> 01:14:12.317]  And if you turn on MSNBC, you're going to get pretty much a nightly dose of, you know, the prosecutor's case against Donald Trump.
[01:14:13.317 --> 01:14:15.018]  That's Greenfield, Jeff Greenfield.
[01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:18.060]  So this is how they're going to sneak out of this, back out of this now.
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:20.481]  Oh, come on, we're all in our own echo chamber.
[01:14:20.481 --> 01:14:21.722]  No, the economy's coming back.
[01:14:21.722 --> 01:14:24.043]  The border's getting secured.
[01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:26.324]  Retirees are getting their future secured.
[01:14:26.324 --> 01:14:28.406]  Thousands of new factories are coming back.
[01:14:28.406 --> 01:14:31.587]  Apple just announced $350 billion in new investment.
[01:14:31.587 --> 01:14:37.651]  The Japanese have announced all total a trillion dollars in new investment.
[01:14:37.651 --> 01:14:40.272]  I mean, I'm not going to spend all our time on this.
[01:14:40.272 --> 01:14:41.193]  That's reality.
[01:14:42.734 --> 01:14:49.638]  Free market delivers a place for a bunch of spoiled brats to bitch and complain.
[01:14:49.638 --> 01:14:51.119]  Like the Women's March.
[01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:52.039]  Free market delivers.
[01:14:52.039 --> 01:14:55.601]  Not communism, not socialism, not command and control.
[01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:57.582]  It's a fact, and you know it's true.
[01:14:57.582 --> 01:15:01.765]  And I know our audience knows that, but we're the people getting outside the bubble.
[01:15:01.765 --> 01:15:03.626]  It's why they're trying to censor us everywhere.
[01:15:03.626 --> 01:15:06.087]  That's why they have to do that, because we're the winners.
[01:15:06.087 --> 01:15:08.768]  We are carrying the light in the dark of the night.
[01:15:08.768 --> 01:15:11.250]  Here is another CNN reporter now telling the truth.
[01:15:13.036 --> 01:15:18.420]  That's Maeve Reston saying, out in America, everybody's sick of this.
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:19.741]  Here it is.
[01:15:19.741 --> 01:15:30.188]  And I think that what's going to be so interesting to watch this year, one of the things that I'm most excited talking to voters about is you are starting to see that uneasiness about the economy sort of dissipate.
[01:15:30.188 --> 01:15:37.273]  Remember even in 2016 when we went out to these swing states and talked to voters, there was still this fear that things were suddenly going to turn down again.
[01:15:37.273 --> 01:15:38.854]  You don't feel that as much anymore.
[01:15:40.675 --> 01:15:51.089]  I'm so interested to see how the Russia investigation affects things because so far out in these districts when you talk to people about Russia, and that's all we talk about at CNN basically, they say they don't care.
[01:15:51.089 --> 01:15:54.093]  It doesn't have any effect on their lives.
[01:15:54.093 --> 01:15:54.314]  Yeah.
[01:15:55.979 --> 01:15:57.880]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.102]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[01:16:02.702 --> 01:16:05.524]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:16:05.524 --> 01:16:06.204]  Awesome.
[01:16:06.204 --> 01:16:09.286]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[01:16:09.286 --> 01:16:10.847]  NASA PAC Technology.
[01:16:10.847 --> 01:16:11.467]  Bacon.
[01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:15.629]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:17.070]  Or warm and served.
[01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.111]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:16:19.111 --> 01:16:21.052]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[01:16:55.956 --> 01:16:57.697]  Hawaii was a wake-up call.
[01:16:57.697 --> 01:17:00.239]  Don't be caught without a disaster shelter.

[01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:27.126]  Hear that?
[01:17:27.126 --> 01:17:32.530]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:35.432]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:17:35.432 --> 01:17:39.014]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:17:57.248 --> 01:18:02.411]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:18:02.411 --> 01:18:07.174]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:18:07.174 --> 01:18:15.859]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:19.101]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:24.602]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:18:24.602 --> 01:18:31.905]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:18:31.905 --> 01:18:35.826]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:18:35.826 --> 01:18:40.547]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:18:40.547 --> 01:18:44.108]  Floralife is sold as a $15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[01:18:44.568 --> 01:18:48.635]  Only 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:18:48.635 --> 01:18:52.842]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[01:18:52.842 --> 01:18:54.144]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:56.654 --> 01:19:01.057]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:01.057 --> 01:19:09.161]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:14.444]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:19:14.444 --> 01:19:16.966]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:19:16.966 --> 01:19:21.188]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:19:21.188 --> 01:19:23.630]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:31.556]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:19:31.556 --> 01:19:38.742]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:19:39.623 --> 01:19:46.807]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:19:46.807 --> 01:19:48.267]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:19:48.267 --> 01:19:50.908]  Use Carnivore by InfoWarsLife.
[01:19:50.908 --> 01:19:54.370]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.

[01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:30.322]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:20:30.322 --> 01:20:32.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:38.297 --> 01:20:42.618]  Stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[01:20:42.618 --> 01:20:48.120]  It's the bounty of the free market and the renaissance and classical liberalism.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.201]  So stand up and be counted for what you are about to receive.
[01:20:51.201 --> 01:20:52.662]  We are the dealers.
[01:20:52.662 --> 01:20:55.523]  We'll give you everything you need.
[01:20:55.523 --> 01:20:56.103]  Which is you.
[01:20:57.369 --> 01:21:00.890]  And your family, with God, not the state, not the system.
[01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.610]  Joel Gilbert joins us for the Balance of the Hour.
[01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:11.692]  At the end of the hour, we have something very special for Conan O'Brien, a little music video I put together, because he's been out virtue signaling in one little tiny area at a private resort in Haiti.
[01:21:11.692 --> 01:21:20.934]  It's all heavily guarded, saying, oh, it's wonderful, no problems here, when the whole island is a leftist money laundering pit, where they keep it in poverty on purpose, but that's a whole other issue.
[01:21:20.934 --> 01:21:25.035]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film, available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:21:26.255 --> 01:21:27.975]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[01:21:27.975 --> 01:21:30.436]  Directed by the amazing director, Joel Gilbert.
[01:21:30.436 --> 01:21:31.276]  Here is the trailer.
[01:21:31.276 --> 01:21:36.897]  You call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[01:21:36.897 --> 01:21:39.978]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:41.758]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[01:21:41.758 --> 01:21:46.019]  Who cares?
[01:21:46.019 --> 01:21:48.800]  You haven't been called.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.040]  Go back to Univision.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.580]  I think Jeb is a nice person.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:53.541]  He's very low energy.
[01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:55.021]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[01:21:58.217 --> 01:21:59.017]  Throw him out.
[01:21:59.017 --> 01:22:00.438]  Throw him out into the cold.
[01:22:00.438 --> 01:22:07.262]  Don't give him their coat.
[01:22:07.262 --> 01:22:08.523]  No coats.
[01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:19.910]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:21.391]  The most dishonest human beings.
[01:22:21.391 --> 01:22:22.212]  These people right here.
[01:22:22.212 --> 01:22:22.752]  Look at all the cameras.
[01:22:23.783 --> 01:22:26.805]  So disgusting!
[01:22:26.805 --> 01:22:29.527]  This socialist slash communist!
[01:22:29.527 --> 01:22:32.310]  Crazy Bernie, he's crazy as it may look.
[01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:35.232]  Pocahontas?
[01:22:35.232 --> 01:22:36.293]  The Indian.
[01:22:36.293 --> 01:22:37.293]  Very offensive!
[01:22:37.293 --> 01:22:38.334]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:22:38.334 --> 01:22:39.255]  Pocahontas?
[01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:42.377]  Crooked Hillary!
[01:22:42.377 --> 01:22:43.558]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:45.880]  She's been crooked from the beginning!
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:51.284]  Crooked Hillary!
[01:22:51.284 --> 01:22:53.166]  Politicians are really dishonest!
[01:22:55.151 --> 01:22:59.153]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[01:22:59.153 --> 01:23:00.614]  This had nothing to do with me.
[01:23:00.614 --> 01:23:04.115]  Except I might have pointed it out.
[01:23:04.115 --> 01:23:06.396]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[01:23:06.396 --> 01:23:08.237]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[01:23:08.237 --> 01:23:10.278]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[01:23:10.278 --> 01:23:11.959]  Because they were protecting him.
[01:23:11.959 --> 01:23:12.899]  I'm trying to be nice.
[01:23:12.899 --> 01:23:15.681]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[01:23:15.681 --> 01:23:17.522]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[01:23:17.522 --> 01:23:19.362]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[01:23:19.362 --> 01:23:20.503]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[01:23:22.347 --> 01:23:25.148]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[01:23:25.148 --> 01:23:26.249]  It just doesn't work!
[01:23:26.249 --> 01:23:28.829]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[01:23:28.829 --> 01:23:30.710]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:34.692]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[01:23:34.692 --> 01:23:36.772]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[01:23:36.772 --> 01:23:40.354]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[01:23:40.354 --> 01:23:41.294]  Repeat after me.
[01:23:41.294 --> 01:23:44.155]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[01:23:44.155 --> 01:23:46.076]  That's not going to happen.
[01:23:46.076 --> 01:23:47.236]  So help me God.
[01:23:47.236 --> 01:23:48.557]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[01:23:54.642 --> 01:23:58.889]  We will make America great again!
[01:23:58.889 --> 01:24:00.271]  Go home to mommy.
[01:24:00.271 --> 01:24:01.794]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[01:24:01.794 --> 01:24:03.356]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[01:24:07.176 --> 01:24:11.219]  Infowarsstore.com, ladies and gentlemen, get the new film.
[01:24:11.219 --> 01:24:12.460]  Very powerful.
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:19.825]  In fact, I've already watched it with my children, and I've explained to them that the globalists teach you to lay down, and when you stand up, it's bad.
[01:24:19.825 --> 01:24:21.826]  We don't throw the first punch.
[01:24:21.826 --> 01:24:23.927]  Verbally, physically, you name it.
[01:24:23.927 --> 01:24:29.171]  But when you throw the punch, when you do it, calling him a misogynist, a Nazi, well, you're crooked Hillary.
[01:24:30.405 --> 01:24:33.546]  Other people called him all sorts of horrible names, and he's a counter puncher.
[01:24:33.546 --> 01:24:37.768]  Well, so am I. And I will sit there and insult these people all day long.
[01:24:37.768 --> 01:24:38.909]  I'm tired of laying down.
[01:24:38.909 --> 01:24:40.869]  What about you, Joel Gilbert?
[01:24:40.869 --> 01:24:42.130]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:43.170]  We've carried them all.
[01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:43.791]  We sell them all.
[01:24:43.791 --> 01:24:44.571]  They're all groundbreaking.
[01:24:44.571 --> 01:24:47.012]  But this one, this one is fun.
[01:24:47.012 --> 01:24:48.312]  And very, very celebratory.
[01:24:48.312 --> 01:24:50.854]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[01:24:50.854 --> 01:24:51.634]  It's really a special film.
[01:24:52.783 --> 01:24:53.283]  Thanks a lot.
[01:24:53.283 --> 01:24:58.885]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the InfoWars.com store.
[01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:02.206]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[01:25:02.206 --> 01:25:05.467]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:18.611]  You'll see how middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:20.952]  And he knew that we were talking like that at home.
[01:25:22.506 --> 01:25:23.187]  Absolutely.
[01:25:23.187 --> 01:25:26.391]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[01:25:26.391 --> 01:25:28.454]  That's why it stuck.
[01:25:28.454 --> 01:25:35.424]  When Megyn Kelly kind of started it off, she accused Trump of calling women fat pigs, slobs, and disgusting animals.
[01:25:35.424 --> 01:25:37.567]  He answered, only Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:25:38.107 --> 01:25:39.828]  And people laughed and laughed.
[01:25:39.828 --> 01:25:47.893]  Maybe a week later, Jorge Ramos kept interrupting him at a press conference, and Trump said, as you saw in the trailer, go back to Univision.
[01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:51.396]  Now, people were thinking, go back to Mexico.
[01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:56.239]  And this is why he got so much heat, and he didn't apologize.
[01:25:56.239 --> 01:25:58.280]  Trump never apologized, and that's why people laughed.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.301]  Well, imagine if you were a U.S.
[01:25:59.301 --> 01:26:03.203]  reporter in Mexico City, in somebody's face, telling the Mexicans what to do.
[01:26:03.203 --> 01:26:04.784]  They'd say, go back to El Norte, Yankee!
[01:26:06.804 --> 01:26:07.744]  That's right.
[01:26:07.744 --> 01:26:11.286]  And Trump took everybody on one by one.
[01:26:11.286 --> 01:26:16.488]  And if you mess with him, you usually didn't last in the Republican race more than two or three more weeks.
[01:26:16.488 --> 01:26:19.169]  And the media couldn't stand up to him either.
[01:26:19.169 --> 01:26:24.331]  So this film, 95 minutes of nonstop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[01:26:24.331 --> 01:26:25.372]  I thought I knew Trump.
[01:26:25.372 --> 01:26:26.652]  I studied Trump.
[01:26:26.652 --> 01:26:27.853]  I thought I knew him.
[01:26:27.853 --> 01:26:30.654]  Only when you see this all back to back, how he reacts.
[01:26:31.734 --> 01:26:33.155]  He speaks from the heart.
[01:26:33.155 --> 01:26:33.995]  He said what he said.
[01:26:33.995 --> 01:26:35.175]  He meant what he said.
[01:26:35.175 --> 01:26:39.977]  Even if it's a little inarticulate or doesn't quite make sense, people understood he was... Oh, exactly.
[01:26:39.977 --> 01:26:41.377]  They say Trump's a fake.
[01:26:41.377 --> 01:26:42.758]  It's the opposite.
[01:26:42.758 --> 01:26:44.538]  And they'll kinda now admit it behind the scenes.
[01:26:44.538 --> 01:26:45.779]  They go, this guy's crazy.
[01:26:45.779 --> 01:26:46.859]  He really believes all this.
[01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:48.615]  Absolutely.
[01:26:48.615 --> 01:26:50.896]  And you'll see the genius of Trump.
[01:26:50.896 --> 01:26:52.257]  They say, oh, he's chaotic.
[01:26:52.257 --> 01:26:54.578]  He's just, you know, a sideshow.
[01:26:54.578 --> 01:27:00.201]  In fact, he controlled the entire media complex with very simple marketing ideas.
[01:27:00.201 --> 01:27:03.862]  Started out with Jeb Bush, had $120 million in the bank.
[01:27:03.862 --> 01:27:07.944]  And Trump thought of two words, low energy, low energy.
[01:27:07.944 --> 01:27:09.004]  And it was over.
[01:27:09.004 --> 01:27:09.645]  It was over.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:13.420]  Thank you.
[01:27:27.637 --> 01:27:33.559]  And now, one year later, they've got the government shut down to try to take away from the celebration.
[01:27:33.559 --> 01:27:37.121]  But even the left's come back to CNN and said, look, we're all over the country.
[01:27:37.121 --> 01:27:41.123]  Everybody that's actually got their head in the real world knows Trump's not even a conservative.
[01:27:41.123 --> 01:27:44.324]  He's just an Americana guy, a free market guy.
[01:27:44.324 --> 01:27:46.625]  And people want the prosperity, and they're really sick of this.
[01:27:47.665 --> 01:27:52.447]  Look, Trump started out his presidency, usually you're given a seven-month honeymoon.
[01:27:52.447 --> 01:27:58.030]  Trump got about seven seconds and two million anti-democracy protesters took to the streets.
[01:27:58.030 --> 01:28:01.151]  They're back at it today, last couple of days.
[01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:05.813]  He's got the entire Democrat Party and media complex against him.
[01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:08.274]  And they use this term from the get-go, resistance.
[01:28:08.274 --> 01:28:16.338]  Now we know resistance is a military term that was used by anti-Nazi partisans, by Hamas in the Middle East, the Islamist terrorists.
[01:28:16.978 --> 01:28:21.280]  And it's meant to lead people to violence in the Antifa movement.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:29.264]  And that's when we saw this James Hodgkinson came out and tried to murder all the Republican leadership when Steve Scalise was seriously injured.
[01:28:29.264 --> 01:28:30.004]  Which they admit.
[01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:32.685]  I mean, even the New York Times said, here's where they meet.
[01:28:32.685 --> 01:28:35.147]  Somebody could attack this and take the leadership out.
[01:28:35.147 --> 01:28:35.687]  Front page!
[01:28:37.068 --> 01:28:39.051]  This is what they're trying to do.
[01:28:39.051 --> 01:28:41.554]  Obama was using all kinds of messages.
[01:28:41.554 --> 01:28:42.956]  Race baiting.
[01:28:42.956 --> 01:28:45.078]  The top 1% have got all your money.
[01:28:45.078 --> 01:28:46.320]  There's an evil boogeyman.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.643]  Remember, Obama told illegal aliens to vote.
[01:28:48.643 --> 01:28:49.424]  We're going to come back.
[01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:50.706]  Joel Gilbert's our guest.
[01:28:50.706 --> 01:28:53.089]  The new film is a must-see.
[01:28:53.089 --> 01:28:54.711]  It is hilarious and informative.
[01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.891]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:56.891 --> 01:28:59.292]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:07.438]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:29:07.438 --> 01:29:09.379]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:09.379 --> 01:29:13.081]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:17.805]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.

[01:29:22.248 --> 01:29:22.908]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:27.591]  Hear that?
[01:29:27.591 --> 01:29:32.974]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:29:32.974 --> 01:29:35.875]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:39.457]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[01:31:17.129 --> 01:31:23.411]  But the immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:24.772]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:31:24.772 --> 01:31:27.353]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:31:28.013 --> 01:31:29.554]  And so much more.
[01:31:29.554 --> 01:31:30.915]  It is concentrated.
[01:31:30.915 --> 01:31:32.635]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:31:32.635 --> 01:31:38.438]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:31:38.438 --> 01:31:39.659]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:31:39.659 --> 01:31:41.660]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:44.261]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:31:44.261 --> 01:31:45.702]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:31:45.702 --> 01:31:48.063]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:31:48.063 --> 01:31:48.783]  Immune Wall.

[01:31:56.445 --> 01:32:15.280]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from Infowarsstore.com, you are funding
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:16.400]  The revolution.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.541]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:32:18.541 --> 01:32:22.521]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:32:37.605 --> 01:32:39.225]  InfoWarsLife.com or AAA2533139.
[01:32:39.225 --> 01:32:40.685]  And your purchase of the products
[01:32:43.866 --> 01:32:49.269]  Stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.

[01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:03.116]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.322 --> 01:33:15.003]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:33:15.003 --> 01:33:18.203]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:33:18.203 --> 01:33:20.084]  Mao took the guns.
[01:33:20.084 --> 01:33:22.224]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:33:22.224 --> 01:33:25.225]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:33:44.779 --> 01:33:49.810]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:52.816]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:34:06.437 --> 01:34:08.338]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:34:08.338 --> 01:34:17.822]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:17.822 --> 01:34:19.302]  Joel Gilbert is our guest.
[01:34:19.302 --> 01:34:24.584]  Ride the shotgun for the rest of the hour.
[01:34:24.584 --> 01:34:31.007]  More and more, the New York Times, the Washington Post, undercover videos from Project Veritas,
[01:34:32.054 --> 01:34:44.626]  Show the Communist Chinese government, the biggest mass murderers in history, trying to crash our stock market, propping theirs up with government funding, at least five, some say ten times what the U.S.
[01:34:44.626 --> 01:34:47.028]  government does.
[01:34:47.028 --> 01:34:52.573]  Involve censoring libertarians and conservatives and Christians online, through Twitter, Facebook and Google.
[01:34:55.626 --> 01:34:57.187]  And it's all admitted.
[01:34:57.187 --> 01:35:01.930]  I mean, these people, there is a Democrat Party alliance with Communist China.
[01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:04.492]  They're financing the whole thing.
[01:35:04.492 --> 01:35:06.513]  And I just can't believe it's all out in the news.
[01:35:06.513 --> 01:35:09.375]  And then you've got Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[01:35:11.787 --> 01:35:18.111]  Funding the Antifa groups who are running all these demonstrations and they are the vicious, most vile people.
[01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:23.034]  I've been covering conservative and libertarian demonstrations for 23 years.
[01:35:23.034 --> 01:35:30.558]  And only in the last 6 or 7 did they turn into like demon zombies.
[01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:38.482]  And there's literally close to 100 videos shot in LA, New York, and Austin over the weekend by our crew who are very brave.
[01:35:38.482 --> 01:35:39.603]  They want to go out and do this.
[01:35:39.603 --> 01:35:40.904]  I don't even order them to go out anymore.
[01:35:41.894 --> 01:35:45.756]  And these people spit on him, they scream at him, they say they're gonna kill him.
[01:35:45.756 --> 01:35:50.217]  Now this guy says on the video, give me a cup of coffee, I'm gonna dump it on him.
[01:35:50.217 --> 01:35:55.720]  So I guess that's the new thing is, they don't just go F you, they dump coffee on you.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:03.063]  And then the New York Times, the Washington Post, I got a BBC article here.
[01:36:04.477 --> 01:36:08.298]  Fascist fighters on the streets of Portland's Antifa group, and they're just angels.
[01:36:08.298 --> 01:36:12.560]  Well, they're gonna attack you, but they're freedom fighters, because you're the Nazis.
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:13.700]  And see, they're the resistance.
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:18.942]  Now, I use the term, the resistance, as we had a globalist government here, and I called it information war.
[01:36:18.942 --> 01:36:21.142]  But yes, it's war, like Gilbert said.
[01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:28.725]  They are trying to censor us off the web and making the announcements, while they
[01:36:29.778 --> 01:36:38.641]  Try to censor us off the street, where my own reporters went out for the young lady that got killed by the illegal alien and the virtue signaling jury let her, the killer, go.
[01:36:38.641 --> 01:36:45.683]  We just tried to go cover the memorial service, and they had guns, communist flags, and they said, you're not coming in.
[01:36:45.683 --> 01:36:48.064]  The Austin cops said, we've been told to stand down.
[01:36:48.064 --> 01:36:49.165]  Just like in D.C.
[01:36:49.165 --> 01:36:53.386]  when they blocked us for hours getting in to hear the president speak.
[01:36:54.707 --> 01:36:56.449]  And then folks went, hey, you got a VIP thing.
[01:36:56.449 --> 01:36:57.349]  You just go right to the front.
[01:36:57.349 --> 01:37:03.215]  Oh, Antifa wasn't there, Black Lives Matter, because that's what the Democrats were going in.
[01:37:03.215 --> 01:37:04.716]  And they were coordinating with the D.C.
[01:37:04.716 --> 01:37:07.018]  police, later came out in the news, with the Maryland police.
[01:37:07.018 --> 01:37:11.502]  That's what's in the documents, too, is they coordinate with blue cities.
[01:37:11.502 --> 01:37:16.987]  Now, you talk about tyranny when you've got the police actively letting you attack people.
[01:37:18.703 --> 01:37:19.323]  It's dangerous.
[01:37:19.323 --> 01:37:22.125]  And imagine what they would have done if Hillary would have gotten in.
[01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:28.850]  Joel Gilbert, the maker of the new amazing film that everybody needs to get and support the Infowar, but it's something everybody's got to watch, to remember all this.
[01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:33.253]  It's just a celebration of how we got here to fight back against these tyrants with free speech.
[01:37:33.253 --> 01:37:37.195]  Trump, the art of the insult, standing up to bullies, directed by Joel Gilbert.
[01:37:37.195 --> 01:37:40.117]  I added the part, standing up to bullies.
[01:37:40.117 --> 01:37:42.059]  So again, they're not used to this.
[01:37:42.059 --> 01:37:48.343]  What are they going to do as they just keep ratcheting up the violence, ratcheting up the attacks, ratcheting up the censorship?
[01:37:49.603 --> 01:37:52.864]  Where do you see the immovable object against the unstoppable force?
[01:37:52.864 --> 01:37:55.065]  How is this going to end?
[01:37:55.065 --> 01:38:02.647]  Well, look, let me first comment on one thing is that the Democrat Party today is a radical socialist party.
[01:38:02.647 --> 01:38:06.048]  Most rank-and-file Democrats don't understand that.
[01:38:06.048 --> 01:38:13.771]  Barack Obama is kind of the epitome of the story of how the radical socialists and communists took over the Democrat Party.
[01:38:13.771 --> 01:38:14.191]  In the late 60s,
[01:38:15.439 --> 01:38:22.564]  Bill Ayers, Weather Underground, there were open calls for revolution, bombing police stations, murdering people.
[01:38:22.564 --> 01:38:29.068]  And they said they were going to put 50 million Americans in re-education centers and murder 25 million of them.
[01:38:29.068 --> 01:38:31.450]  And this plan failed very badly because it was so evil.
[01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:44.534]  When these terrorists came out of jail and out of the underground into Chicago in the 1980s, they taught the young group of radicals at that time, like Barack Obama, you cannot overthrow the government from the outside.
[01:38:44.534 --> 01:38:45.655]  We were wrong.
[01:38:45.655 --> 01:38:48.176]  Instead, you need to overthrow it from within.
[01:38:48.176 --> 01:38:52.257]  Therefore, don't tell people about your Marxism and socialism.
[01:38:52.257 --> 01:38:53.198]  Keep it to yourself.
[01:38:53.198 --> 01:38:53.858]  Just tell people
[01:38:54.730 --> 01:38:55.811]  You want to help families.
[01:38:55.811 --> 01:38:57.453]  You want to give them free health care.
[01:38:57.453 --> 01:39:02.798]  And once you take power, you'll throw them under the bus and pursue this radical agenda that no one voted for.
[01:39:02.798 --> 01:39:06.581]  And then you can use the tools of state to maintain power.
[01:39:06.581 --> 01:39:13.508]  And that's what Obama did in 2012 by using the IRS to suppress the conservative free speech movement while the left was allowed to organize.
[01:39:14.128 --> 01:39:19.749]  And then he interfered apparently in the 2016 election and tried to through the FBI and DOJ.
[01:39:19.749 --> 01:39:27.071]  It's classical Marxist behavior because they cannot maintain power with their policies that are failures.
[01:39:27.071 --> 01:39:29.111]  We didn't need Russian interference in either election.
[01:39:29.111 --> 01:39:32.852]  We had our own Bolshevik in the White House in the form of Barack Obama.
[01:39:32.852 --> 01:39:38.873]  Now when you see the film Trump the Art of the Insult, which you should buy in the Infowars store, please, Art of the Insult,
[01:39:39.654 --> 01:39:46.723]  You'll see the simplicity of the message of just standing up to this fascism when Trump had those records.
[01:39:47.347 --> 01:40:10.340]  All those rallies, like the Trumpapalooza tour, he'd fly in, and you'll see that in the film, he'd fly into these airport hangars four and five times a day, and he'd put on this great performance art, mocking and ridiculing Hillary and his opponents, and these idiot protesters, this is how stupid the left is, the protesters would show up thinking, well, we're going to show up, Trump, we're going to make him look bad, and the media would come to cover these protesters.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:10.940]  I think?
[01:40:30.683 --> 01:40:36.528]  Middle America, that Harry Truman style person that speaks from the heart and tells it like it is.
[01:40:36.528 --> 01:40:50.659]  I think he can win out with the Republican Party in 2018 and in the end win the day because the radical socialist Democrats do not represent anything to do with American society or free market principles that made this country so great.
[01:40:51.536 --> 01:40:57.318]  Man, Joel, you are so on target, and that is exactly what we're dealing with here.
[01:40:57.318 --> 01:41:04.820]  The globalists and the socialist-controlled media, they're so used to having no opposition, and an asleep population, they could get away with this.
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:09.701]  But now you see the moves they're making, they're so dumb, but they've worked everywhere else in the world.
[01:41:09.701 --> 01:41:12.102]  Soros has overthrown, as you know, more than 10 countries.
[01:41:13.722 --> 01:41:24.446]  Some really interesting fellows here in studio, whose military backgrounds are secret, but I know some of it, who are top-tier, top-tier guys, the most elite teams out there.
[01:41:24.446 --> 01:41:29.928]  And they were asking me, what do we do as veterans and the groups we know to counter this?
[01:41:29.928 --> 01:41:31.448]  Because these groups are terrorists.
[01:41:31.448 --> 01:41:35.590]  They saw the videos of Antifa with guns, not letting people demonstrate in America.
[01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:37.890]  And I had to say to them, just keep waking people up.
[01:41:37.890 --> 01:41:39.631]  Let's make the country be successful.
[01:41:39.631 --> 01:41:41.832]  Let's counter who they are, information warfare.
[01:41:43.193 --> 01:41:48.476]  But yeah, at a certain point, I didn't know what to say or what we should do, but just move forward.
[01:41:48.476 --> 01:41:51.618]  I mean, what would you say to those guys they should do?
[01:41:51.618 --> 01:41:57.202]  Well, I'll get to that, but people, you got to understand that Trump was not a real estate guy when he ran for president.
[01:41:57.202 --> 01:42:00.144]  He'd been in the entertainment business for 30 years.
[01:42:00.144 --> 01:42:06.708]  He'd been doing marketing and hype through pro wrestling, pro boxing, USFL, Miss America,
[01:42:07.168 --> 01:42:12.832]  Sure, he said, my job will be being a cheerleader for America and the economy, and it's here!
[01:42:12.832 --> 01:42:16.015]  The globalists have been cheerleading for China against us, exactly!
[01:42:16.015 --> 01:42:23.801]  So the answer is, love America, love success, love free market, love ourselves, that will counter the globalists trying to demoralize us.
[01:42:23.801 --> 01:42:27.724]  Well, and Trump has done it with really what were essentially leftist tactics.
[01:42:27.724 --> 01:42:32.928]  I got a email from somebody, he saw my film and said, Saul Alinsky works for us now.
[01:42:33.673 --> 01:42:48.041]  And it's true, because Trump, while he's going to sleep, or when he wakes up, it's very easy for him to send out a few tweets, and he literally changes the entire narrative of the country in the news that obsess over every single tweet.
[01:42:48.041 --> 01:42:54.925]  And he can always change the narrative of the next one, and they're so narcissistic, they don't get they're being led around by the nose like a mentally ill bull.

[01:43:55.739 --> 01:43:57.801]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:43:57.801 --> 01:43:58.122]  Go ahead.
[01:43:58.750 --> 01:44:00.632]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:44:00.632 --> 01:44:04.495]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:44:04.495 --> 01:44:05.936]  It just gets old, man.
[01:44:05.936 --> 01:44:08.358]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:44:08.358 --> 01:44:10.659]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:44:10.659 --> 01:44:14.683]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:44:14.683 --> 01:44:17.105]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:20.286]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:44:20.286 --> 01:44:22.007]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:44:22.007 --> 01:44:23.127]  Us being shut down?
[01:44:23.127 --> 01:44:24.608]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:44:24.608 --> 01:44:25.688]  You know what, Alex?
[01:44:25.688 --> 01:44:26.789]  Put him on pause again.
[01:44:26.789 --> 01:44:27.889]  Hey, Frank!
[01:44:27.889 --> 01:44:33.531]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:44:33.531 --> 01:44:38.073]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:44:38.073 --> 01:44:41.194]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:44:41.194 --> 01:44:41.655]  You understand?
[01:44:41.655 --> 01:44:43.295]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:44:43.295 --> 01:44:44.436]  I need your help, Frank!

[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:31.625]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.625 --> 01:47:33.687]  We shall defend our Republic.
[01:47:33.687 --> 01:47:36.789]  We shall never surrender.
[01:47:36.789 --> 01:47:39.531]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:47:39.531 --> 01:47:40.952]  Joel Gilbert is our guest.
[01:47:40.952 --> 01:47:43.494]  I'm going back to him in just a moment, but this dovetails all together.
[01:47:45.063 --> 01:47:57.052]  We're in the middle of an epic battle, historical battle against free market systems that have their own problems, but are light years better than command and control, the ancient forms of barbarism and everything that comes with it.
[01:47:57.052 --> 01:48:00.174]  Like black unemployment doubling under Obama.
[01:48:00.174 --> 01:48:03.276]  And food stamp usage doubling under Obama.
[01:48:03.276 --> 01:48:05.858]  It doubled.
[01:48:05.858 --> 01:48:09.801]  From what, 49 million to 100 and something million.
[01:48:09.801 --> 01:48:10.502]  Total control.
[01:48:13.134 --> 01:48:15.916]  And I've known people that were smart, good-looking, intelligent.
[01:48:15.916 --> 01:48:19.860]  You see them after five years of unemployment, they're like zombies.
[01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:20.920]  Sedentary lifestyle.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.563]  How many people retire and then die in the first six months?
[01:48:23.563 --> 01:48:25.144]  A large percentage.
[01:48:25.144 --> 01:48:34.291]  I've had family that retires, they're super happy, type A personalities, they're dead in a year.
[01:48:34.291 --> 01:48:35.112]  So it's the same thing.
[01:48:35.112 --> 01:48:36.813]  They want to make you dependent and it's sick.
[01:48:36.813 --> 01:48:42.198]  And Obama flies in on jumbo jets and tells Africans you can't have cars and air conditioning.
[01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:52.821]  They're selling austerity, and Trump's selling prosperity, and whole new economies out of clean technology.
[01:48:52.821 --> 01:49:01.310]  You know, the whole new budget and everything Trump's done, and the tax cut has all this really innovative new energy stuff, and it's not just boondoggles, it's just tax write-offs.
[01:49:02.793 --> 01:49:05.654]  To bring that industry here and to bring innovation.
[01:49:05.654 --> 01:49:09.516]  And Trump's taking the regulations off what they call disruptive technology.
[01:49:09.516 --> 01:49:15.518]  Secretly, that's what he's really doing, I'll let you know, is allowing the deployment of a lot of technology the U.S.
[01:49:15.518 --> 01:49:18.559]  has been sitting on.
[01:49:18.559 --> 01:49:19.880]  And that's this year.
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:20.840]  It's already started this year.
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.061]  You're going to see, oh, look at this thing our scientists discovered.
[01:49:24.061 --> 01:49:25.722]  Oh, they just published the paper.
[01:49:25.722 --> 01:49:27.203]  Oh, we're going to give this to U.S.
[01:49:27.203 --> 01:49:29.164]  companies.
[01:49:29.164 --> 01:49:30.124]  Watch, within one month.
[01:49:34.927 --> 01:49:37.449]  Yes, Buck Rogers, let's go, baby!
[01:49:37.449 --> 01:49:40.672]  Yeah!
[01:49:40.672 --> 01:49:48.399]  Got somebody not out to screw you, but the globalists got us to the point that they were going to shut down free speech, shut everything down, and really bring in nasty stuff.
[01:49:48.399 --> 01:49:57.547]  And even large sections of the elite went, you know, this globalism doesn't work so good, and this is really nasty, and we don't want to do this.
[01:49:59.926 --> 01:50:02.648]  So there's a real war going on in the elite right now.
[01:50:02.648 --> 01:50:04.229]  Don't think Trump just did this on his own.
[01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:06.470]  He was recruited by patriots and U.S.
[01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:11.013]  intelligence agencies, for a fact.
[01:50:11.013 --> 01:50:12.654]  Trump was recruited by the U.S.
[01:50:12.654 --> 01:50:16.317]  Army.
[01:50:16.317 --> 01:50:21.460]  That's a big secret, but you deserve to know what the Democrats already know.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:23.461]  You deserve to understand what's really going on.
[01:50:23.461 --> 01:50:28.044]  We were being held underwater!
[01:50:28.044 --> 01:50:29.325]  The country was being drowned!
[01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:32.919]  That's over!
[01:50:32.919 --> 01:50:35.281]  And the Communist Chinese are crapping their britches right now.
[01:50:35.281 --> 01:50:37.484]  They're hurting their people that we're having a good economy.
[01:50:37.484 --> 01:50:38.124]  That'll help them.
[01:50:38.124 --> 01:50:40.807]  I'm gonna go back to Joel, but let me get to this right now.
[01:50:40.807 --> 01:50:43.230]  And we'll hold Joel over a little bit the next hour, but let me just get to this right now.
[01:50:44.989 --> 01:50:52.436]  It makes me sick to watch the One Foundation in Africa and Haiti collect billions of dollars, that's Bono and U2, and then only give 1%.
[01:50:52.436 --> 01:50:53.597]  That's mainstream news.
[01:50:53.597 --> 01:50:53.997]  They give 1%.
[01:50:53.997 --> 01:50:56.719]  You can click on the Daily Mail article.
[01:50:56.719 --> 01:51:10.732]  And then to watch Conan O'Brien go to Haiti to the one of two resorts where it's somewhat safe, where rich people basically barge in on boats and don't go anywhere else, landlocked between mountains.
[01:51:12.182 --> 01:51:13.943]  And he says, oh, Haiti is beautiful.
[01:51:13.943 --> 01:51:14.484]  It's wonderful.
[01:51:14.484 --> 01:51:15.785]  Come here.
[01:51:15.785 --> 01:51:18.427]  Well, we hope to help Haiti and let them get their own economy.
[01:51:18.427 --> 01:51:24.851]  But when you read the State Department travel advisory, it says violent crimes such as armed robbery is common.
[01:51:24.851 --> 01:51:29.715]  Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents or emergencies.
[01:51:29.715 --> 01:51:33.898]  Protests, tire burning and road blockages are frequent and often spontaneous.
[01:51:33.898 --> 01:51:35.599]  That means getting robbed.
[01:51:35.599 --> 01:51:40.402]  And it goes on to say the entire place is super deadly and dangerous.
[01:51:40.402 --> 01:51:40.502]  OK.
[01:51:41.403 --> 01:51:43.083]  That's a travel advisory.
[01:51:43.083 --> 01:51:51.325]  He goes and poses with a coconut to virtue signal to say that Trump's full of bulls saying it's a literal you-know-what hole when that's taken out of context.
[01:51:51.325 --> 01:51:55.666]  He said S-H-I-T, house, not hole.
[01:51:55.666 --> 01:52:03.268]  And saying why are we only bringing people in from these countries but blocking it from others, which they do.
[01:52:03.268 --> 01:52:05.249]  Because it's about suppressing and controlling.
[01:52:05.249 --> 01:52:06.529]  So the internet picked this up.
[01:52:08.928 --> 01:52:13.272]  And has gone in and photoshopped him in real scenes of Haiti.
[01:52:13.272 --> 01:52:17.256]  And the internet is standing up to his hypocrisy and his sick virtue signaling.
[01:52:17.256 --> 01:52:21.640]  But it's nothing compared to the leftist groups that go in there and use it as a money laundering operation.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:30.248]  Or the Clintons that have been caught shipping little kids out and their own people have been indicted and convicted for smuggling kids out for absolutely horrible things.
[01:52:30.248 --> 01:52:34.012]  Meanwhile, we send in food and resources and medicine and Trump paid.
[01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:42.250]  To have thousands and thousands of children get medical care back when he was a candidate and no news coverage of that.
[01:52:42.250 --> 01:52:43.411]  But Rand Paul has talked about it.
[01:52:43.411 --> 01:52:49.152]  He flew in on the aid mission financed by Trump.
[01:52:49.152 --> 01:52:51.453]  So that's our crew and that's our people.
[01:52:51.453 --> 01:52:53.353]  They're actually doing something.
[01:52:53.353 --> 01:52:55.614]  And you see all these evil white conservatives.
[01:52:55.614 --> 01:52:56.374]  They're actually helping.
[01:52:56.374 --> 01:52:57.174]  They're all conservatives.
[01:52:58.206 --> 01:53:03.210]  You see, left is grandstanding what heroes they are because they're posers and they're fakes and they're actors.
[01:53:03.210 --> 01:53:17.982]  So here's a satirical song I put together with video that we shot in Haiti of not just him in the middle of cesspools and things, we'll come back to Joel Gilbert, but of him floating around again in the real Haiti.
[01:53:17.982 --> 01:53:18.643]  So here it is.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:46.817]  A glory hole, a heavenly place to go And Conan O'Brien, he will be your guide In the wondrous land in the sea Drink your coconut, bathe in the pool The ocean will smile at you
[01:53:50.380 --> 01:54:02.362]  Donald Trump, he's a devil, a liar, a fool, misogynistic, evil, homophobe.
[01:54:02.362 --> 01:54:15.984]  How dare him pay to send thousands of doctors to Haiti personally, and like grandpa, to do the hundreds of eye surgeries.
[01:54:15.984 --> 01:54:18.545]  Because Haiti doesn't need help,
[01:54:19.657 --> 01:54:23.705]  It's got coconuts and coconut milk.
[01:54:23.705 --> 01:54:25.388]  Heavenly place.
[01:54:25.388 --> 01:54:27.031]  Oh, Conan.
[01:54:27.031 --> 01:54:28.834]  Oh, Brian.
[01:54:28.834 --> 01:54:31.138]  Our loving leader said.
[01:54:32.208 --> 01:54:39.152]  O'Connor, O'Brien, he said it was a heavenly place.
[01:54:39.152 --> 01:54:43.195]  Liberals know the truth about it.
[01:54:43.195 --> 01:54:46.317]  It's not a sh**hole.
[01:54:46.317 --> 01:54:50.860]  And North Korea is not a hellhole either.
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.262]  Venezuela is good.
[01:54:54.262 --> 01:54:57.725]  Everywhere the leftists run things.
[01:54:57.725 --> 01:55:00.627]  Oh, it is so good.
[01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:07.592]  So remember, remember, Haiti is your place.
[01:55:07.592 --> 01:55:10.734]  And they don't need any aid or any food.
[01:55:11.394 --> 01:55:14.356]  Or any medicine either.
[01:55:14.356 --> 01:55:21.360]  Because Haiti didn't need the two billion that the Clintons took.
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:27.383]  Oh, and then there's the One Foundation that raised money as well.
[01:55:27.383 --> 01:55:33.847]  And Barlow calls it the One Foundation because he only gives one percent.
[01:55:33.847 --> 01:55:35.527]  But that's okay.
[01:55:35.527 --> 01:55:39.630]  They're so liberal, always so trendy and good.
[01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:47.874]  So remember, Donald Trump is Hitler, and everything will be good.
[01:55:47.874 --> 01:55:53.376]  Don't forget to download the latest track at communismworkswonderful.com.
[01:55:53.376 --> 01:55:58.259]  And remember, free market's a true shithole, but everywhere else that leftists run is heaven.
[01:56:00.425 --> 01:56:07.087]  And again, if you go to Chicago where the left runs it, or New York, or Maryland, or L.A., it's just wonderful.
[01:56:07.087 --> 01:56:10.788]  Seattle, there's just crap everywhere, heroin deals, people flopping around.
[01:56:10.788 --> 01:56:16.650]  Joel Gilbert's going to be with us into the next hour, because I want to give him the floor for a couple of segments to really get into how we counter this and get serious.
[01:56:16.650 --> 01:56:18.511]  And the new film everybody should order, Trump.
[01:56:18.911 --> 01:56:19.872]  The art of the insult.
[01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:21.933]  You absolutely need to get it at Infowarstore.com.
[01:56:21.933 --> 01:56:23.474]  It doesn't just fund the operation.
[01:56:23.474 --> 01:56:24.595]  It is hilarious.
[01:56:24.595 --> 01:56:25.495]  Super positive.
[01:56:25.495 --> 01:56:26.676]  Great for parties.
[01:56:26.676 --> 01:56:29.578]  Great to write reports on for college or school.
[01:56:29.578 --> 01:56:30.198]  This is it.
[01:56:30.198 --> 01:56:31.419]  You need to get this film.
[01:56:31.419 --> 01:56:32.780]  It's Gilbert's best film.
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:34.541]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:56:34.541 --> 01:56:35.422]  We got about a minute and a half.
[01:56:35.422 --> 01:56:36.182]  We got a break here.
[01:56:36.182 --> 01:56:38.664]  But just seeing me be sarcastic about that.
[01:56:38.664 --> 01:56:41.826]  What do you think of Conan O'Brien and all this virtue signaling?
[01:56:41.826 --> 01:56:43.187]  And there's no end to these people.
[01:56:45.375 --> 01:56:47.117]  I thought it was a fantastic video.
[01:56:47.117 --> 01:56:49.298]  The left live in a fantasy world.
[01:56:49.298 --> 01:56:53.041]  They've always lived in a fantasy world where there's a perfect utopia.
[01:56:53.041 --> 01:56:55.923]  As you saw in my prior film, there's no place like utopia.
[01:56:55.923 --> 01:57:04.050]  Leftists compare America to the perfect paradise and they conclude that we must tear it down and rebuild this perfect world.
[01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:09.754]  Conservatives, or normal people, like I consider myself, I'm from Tennessee, I didn't
[01:57:10.464 --> 01:57:11.864]  Grow up in LA.
[01:57:11.864 --> 01:57:20.207]  We look at America and compare it to the rest of the world, and we of course conclude that America's free markets, free religion, and government system is the greatest place to live.
[01:57:20.207 --> 01:57:20.967]  We want to build it up.
[01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:22.207]  We don't want to tear it down.
[01:57:22.207 --> 01:57:22.688]  That's right.
[01:57:22.688 --> 01:57:25.228]  We'll be back with our number three, Joel Gilbert.
[01:57:25.228 --> 01:57:31.830]  Your phone calls and more, because the globalists aren't giving up, and they're about to counter-strike big time and take our victory from us.
[01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:33.891]  But we're not going to let that happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:34.691 --> 01:57:35.552]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:35.552 --> 01:57:36.713]  This is the InfoWars.
[01:57:36.713 --> 01:57:46.100]  If you're watching on Twitter, Facebook, Google, or other systems, spread those live links now as an act of resistance.
[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:49.583]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:57:49.583 --> 01:58:01.073]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:01.973]  This is pollen blood.
[01:58:02.974 --> 01:58:15.644]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[01:58:15.644 --> 01:58:19.487]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[01:58:19.947 --> 01:58:24.448]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[01:58:24.448 --> 01:58:34.510]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:37.651]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.
[01:58:37.651 --> 01:58:42.012]  Available now at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:58:42.012 --> 01:58:44.613]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:58:44.613 --> 01:58:45.033]  Go ahead.
[01:58:50.084 --> 01:58:52.005]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:58:52.005 --> 01:59:02.512]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:59:02.512 --> 01:59:05.874]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:59:06.314 --> 01:59:06.594]  Absolutely.
[01:59:29.094 --> 01:59:49.920]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:52.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.088 --> 02:00:07.589]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:08.570]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:11.251]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:11.251 --> 02:00:13.012]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:13.012 --> 02:00:14.652]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.652 --> 02:00:19.435]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.162 --> 02:00:35.643]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:35.643 --> 02:00:36.703]  Joel Gilbert is our guest.
[02:00:36.703 --> 02:00:38.244]  We're going to open the phones up.
[02:00:38.244 --> 02:00:47.486]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll talk about his film, we'll talk about the state of the world, the Women's March, you name it, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-A-L-E-X.
[02:00:47.486 --> 02:00:56.469]  On one big topic, or two, what's your favorite nickname that Trump's come up with for any of these knuckle-dragging, lying scumbags like Crooked Hillary?
[02:00:58.126 --> 02:01:04.092]  Well, look, some of them worked really well, like Crooked Hillary had a lot of truth to it.
[02:01:04.092 --> 02:01:06.815]  Low Energy Jeb had a lot of humor.
[02:01:06.815 --> 02:01:11.439]  Some of them didn't go quite as well, like, you know, Carly Fiorina.
[02:01:11.439 --> 02:01:12.400]  Look at that face.
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.982]  That was kind of off-limits for women.
[02:01:13.982 --> 02:01:15.203]  You can't talk about their face.
[02:01:15.923 --> 02:01:26.451]  Of course, little Marco was a little bit demeaning, but it kind of revealed him as really more of a person who was little in his ideas as well as physically.
[02:01:26.451 --> 02:01:30.134]  But I, you know, you got to just say Crooked Hillary was the best.
[02:01:30.134 --> 02:01:33.297]  It carried the general election campaign.
[02:01:33.297 --> 02:01:35.318]  Democrats knew she was crooked.
[02:01:35.318 --> 02:01:37.520]  The FBI knew she was crooked.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:39.362]  Everybody knew she was corrupt.
[02:01:39.362 --> 02:01:43.164]  And I think that way of branding her was
[02:01:44.548 --> 02:01:46.369]  A tremendous effort.
[02:01:46.369 --> 02:01:47.589]  And you can't brand it.
[02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:48.949]  It's like Fat Albert's Fat.
[02:01:48.949 --> 02:01:50.470]  I mean, she's Crooked Hillary.
[02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:51.670]  And of course, I love the new ones.
[02:01:51.670 --> 02:01:53.731]  Rocket Man, stuff like that.
[02:01:53.731 --> 02:01:55.611]  Well, we got Rocket Man for Kim Jong Un.
[02:01:55.611 --> 02:01:57.552]  We've got crying Chuck Schumer.
[02:01:57.552 --> 02:02:04.094]  We've got sneaky Dan Feinstein because she revealed the transcripts illegally.
[02:02:04.094 --> 02:02:08.895]  So Trump is going to, I think he's going to continue to brand and call out his opponents.
[02:02:09.395 --> 02:02:17.318]  And it's really just about strength and taking a stand and defending his turf and principles, calling out those who behave badly.
[02:02:17.318 --> 02:02:28.322]  Don't forget, when the public and the media freaks out about Trump said this or tweeted that, Barack Obama was abusing the public and the American electorate every day he was in office.
[02:02:28.322 --> 02:02:32.043]  He called Americans racist at every opportunity.
[02:02:32.043 --> 02:02:36.745]  He used the tools of state, the IRS, of course, fast and furious, Benghazi.
[02:02:37.405 --> 02:02:46.090]  Every single day he was trolling, calling Americans the top 1% or taking all your money, you know, give us the power, we'll take it back.
[02:02:46.090 --> 02:02:49.832]  It was eight years of evil trolling.
[02:02:49.832 --> 02:02:58.557]  Trump uses some humor and really calls out his opponents to defend himself and I expect him to keep doing that and that's what's going to make him a strong president.
[02:02:58.557 --> 02:02:59.057]  That's right.
[02:02:59.057 --> 02:03:01.759]  And Pocahontas, she's not a Native American, she lied about it.
[02:03:02.452 --> 02:03:05.975]  Yeah, when you see the film, you'll see things in, uh, you know, Trump Diary of the Exiled, again, go to InfoWarsStore, you can't miss this movie.
[02:03:19.375 --> 02:03:22.816]  You know, you'll see things you never thought happened.
[02:03:22.816 --> 02:03:24.997]  The deplorable speech by Hillary.
[02:03:24.997 --> 02:03:27.318]  People remember... I didn't see the whole speech.
[02:03:27.318 --> 02:03:30.620]  They just remember she called Trump supporters deplorables.
[02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:33.661]  Well, it was much, much, much worse than that.
[02:03:33.661 --> 02:03:38.183]  She called them homophobic, xenophobic, not American, on and on.
[02:03:38.183 --> 02:03:47.587]  And you'll see Trump and his supporters destroy Hillary and anyone that tries to... Well, that's the big thing, is they call everybody Nazis and all these other names, and then if you just call them crooked, they're like,
[02:03:47.947 --> 02:03:49.930]  Right, remember, think of how, what is an obscene
[02:04:06.918 --> 02:04:11.299]  Action or verbs, a verbal action by a president.
[02:04:11.299 --> 02:04:16.460]  Barack Obama invited Black Lives Matter to the White House.
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:22.141]  He sent White House representatives to the funeral of Michael Brown in St.
[02:04:22.141 --> 02:04:26.722]  Louis and said that, you know, he was this perfect guy.
[02:04:26.722 --> 02:04:29.783]  And then somebody in Dallas murders policemen.
[02:04:30.658 --> 02:04:31.979]  Oh, what a surprise.
[02:04:31.979 --> 02:04:35.200]  Obama is the one who propagated these lies.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.061]  And then he won't go to bed.
[02:04:36.061 --> 02:04:36.961]  That's teased.
[02:04:36.961 --> 02:04:38.021]  And what are we doing about it?
[02:04:38.021 --> 02:04:44.264]  And then Obama, well Alex, then Obama shows up at the funeral for the cops and calls Americans racist.
[02:04:44.264 --> 02:04:45.985]  Now, what is more offensive?
[02:04:45.985 --> 02:04:52.208]  All that behavior that resulted in the death of policemen and then Obama going and telling people that you're racist.
[02:04:52.208 --> 02:04:53.408]  He didn't show up in Louisiana.
[02:04:55.177 --> 02:04:58.599]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[02:04:58.599 --> 02:05:02.562]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[02:05:02.562 --> 02:05:05.904]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[02:05:05.904 --> 02:05:08.446]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[02:05:08.446 --> 02:05:13.169]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[02:05:13.169 --> 02:05:15.510]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:21.915]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:22.535 --> 02:05:30.725]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:05:30.725 --> 02:05:35.790]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:05:35.790 --> 02:05:42.778]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.

[02:06:34.552 --> 02:06:36.674]  Basically blocks the fluoride from my own research.
[02:06:37.901 --> 02:06:39.802]  Cause we'd have weight loss, stamina, energy.
[02:06:39.802 --> 02:06:41.324]  It's really amazing.
[02:06:41.324 --> 02:06:51.071]  That is 40% off when you get it with the Secret 12 High Quality Organic Vitamin B12 that you take under the tongue.
[02:06:51.071 --> 02:06:52.772]  Those are 40% off together right now.
[02:06:56.488 --> 02:07:06.350]  Also, for seasonal distress and the pollen and all the dust and the garbage that's 24 hours a day in this country, we've got the pollen block.
[02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:07.251]  You need to research that.
[02:07:07.251 --> 02:07:08.111]  It's natural.
[02:07:08.111 --> 02:07:09.551]  It's organic.
[02:07:09.551 --> 02:07:14.012]  It's specially fed Japanese quail.
[02:07:14.012 --> 02:07:16.713]  And then it's their eggs concentrated in the capillaries that you just chew up.
[02:07:17.895 --> 02:07:18.675]  Does it really taste good?
[02:07:18.675 --> 02:07:19.956]  Does it taste bad?
[02:07:19.956 --> 02:07:25.958]  And then within an hour, it's been proven, documented to relieve a lot of people, seasonal distress, pollen block.
[02:07:25.958 --> 02:07:30.839]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:07:30.839 --> 02:07:37.722]  And we have air filtration units right now that are extremely high quality, the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:07:37.722 --> 02:07:39.762]  Normally a great deal at $200, it's $149 right now.
[02:07:42.569 --> 02:07:43.209]  And free shipping.
[02:07:43.209 --> 02:07:44.670]  You cannot beat that deal.
[02:07:44.670 --> 02:07:48.112]  Leading competitors basically sell the same four-stage ION filter.
[02:07:48.112 --> 02:07:50.874]  One of them is ION and has ION Cluster and three others.
[02:07:50.874 --> 02:07:54.076]  Well, these babies are a great deal at $200.
[02:07:54.076 --> 02:07:57.138]  Leading competitors are $400 to $800.
[02:07:57.138 --> 02:08:03.661]  It has 478 reviews, 4.9 stars by Power Reviews, 97%.
[02:08:03.661 --> 02:08:05.342]  Nobody's got that.
[02:08:05.342 --> 02:08:06.603]  And this is a true game-changer.
[02:08:06.603 --> 02:08:08.804]  Whatever the best deal is, the highest quality.
[02:08:08.804 --> 02:08:11.086]  There's one philosophy where you just sell things
[02:08:12.281 --> 02:08:17.265]  With a super high sticker on them, and say they're the best, and then there are some people that will buy whatever's expensive.
[02:08:17.265 --> 02:08:19.166]  About 10% they say.
[02:08:19.166 --> 02:08:20.347]  It varies country to country.
[02:08:20.347 --> 02:08:21.268]  I don't follow the marketing.
[02:08:21.268 --> 02:08:26.332]  I just go get the very best, lowest price, and want to sell an absolutely huge amount of them to fund the operation.
[02:08:26.332 --> 02:08:27.953]  Which we do.
[02:08:27.953 --> 02:08:29.394]  But at 200 bucks it's a great deal.
[02:08:29.394 --> 02:08:30.795]  People sit around until it's discounted.
[02:08:30.795 --> 02:08:33.618]  I mean, this is just crazy discount.
[02:08:34.568 --> 02:08:37.189]  Cause I know it costs like 80 bucks to make the thing.
[02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:38.809]  So, it's amazing.
[02:08:38.809 --> 02:08:41.790]  It's got phase one, phase two, phase three, and phase four.
[02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:45.671]  The ion cluster, true HEPA filter, carbon filter, pre-filter.
[02:08:45.671 --> 02:08:47.412]  Four filters.
[02:08:47.412 --> 02:08:51.133]  And my wife, God love her, she's like, it's always red, it's broken.
[02:08:51.133 --> 02:08:55.914]  And I said, baby, you gotta take off the pre-filter for like cat hair and stuff.
[02:08:55.914 --> 02:08:59.195]  You know, when it's red all the time, that means it needs to be clean.
[02:08:59.195 --> 02:09:01.596]  And you just brush it off, put it back in.
[02:09:01.596 --> 02:09:03.697]  And whenever, I mean, I don't want to get graphic here,
[02:09:05.134 --> 02:09:08.877]  Somebody can pass gas 30 feet away, the thing turns red right away.
[02:09:08.877 --> 02:09:11.780]  I mean, that's how powerful this is.
[02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:13.361]  And so let's pure breeze.
[02:09:13.361 --> 02:09:14.702]  Your family deserves it.
[02:09:14.702 --> 02:09:18.325]  Four or five of them will do the whole house, a big house and an apartment.
[02:09:18.325 --> 02:09:20.547]  One of them will do a smaller apartment.
[02:09:21.547 --> 02:09:23.889]  So, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:09:23.889 --> 02:09:27.272]  Okay, Joel Gilbert, you got the floor for the rest of this segment.
[02:09:27.272 --> 02:09:31.155]  We're going to take calls next segment on two big subjects, callers.
[02:09:31.155 --> 02:09:32.776]  What's your favorite thing Trump's done?
[02:09:32.776 --> 02:09:34.318]  Favorite nickname?
[02:09:34.318 --> 02:09:36.399]  What do you make of the first year?
[02:09:36.399 --> 02:09:37.840]  How are the globalists going to strike back?
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:38.561]  What are your concerns?
[02:09:38.561 --> 02:09:39.802]  Maybe you're not happy with Trump.
[02:09:39.802 --> 02:09:41.243]  We'll also take those calls.
[02:09:41.243 --> 02:09:43.705]  So, it's 877-789-ALEX.
[02:09:43.705 --> 02:09:48.649]  I got other callers about, you know, Geneva Bible revision, or stuff.
[02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:49.830]  I'll get to you after Joel's gone.
[02:09:50.521 --> 02:09:51.542]  I'll take your call.
[02:09:51.542 --> 02:09:58.667]  He's here to talk about this general area, the film, which is unbelievable, great to show the kids.
[02:09:58.667 --> 02:10:01.008]  We couldn't stop laughing for 95 minutes.
[02:10:01.008 --> 02:10:02.870]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:05.612]  Okay, going back to Joel Gilbert, repeat what you said about...
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.882]  Bringing in Black Lives Matter, then when cops get killed, going to the funeral in Dallas and saying, it's your fault, you're racist.
[02:10:11.882 --> 02:10:15.243]  CNN even said that, because some black cops get killed, now it's their fault.
[02:10:15.243 --> 02:10:17.824]  Then he didn't go to Louisiana, though, where it happened.
[02:10:17.824 --> 02:10:22.806]  And it just shows betting on old communist programs that don't work anymore.
[02:10:22.806 --> 02:10:24.307]  And then how do people counter this?
[02:10:24.307 --> 02:10:25.047]  How do you deal with it?
[02:10:27.126 --> 02:10:36.626]  Look, unfortunately, the establishment Republicans and the conservatives have traditionally not understood how to fight the left in the political battlefield.
[02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:41.072]  And they haven't understood that the Democrat Party is a radical party.
[02:10:41.072 --> 02:10:50.756]  They're willing to lie, engage in voter fraud, and use the tools of state, IRS, DOJ, FBI, to crush the will of the American voter.
[02:10:50.756 --> 02:11:03.261]  I like to quote Alexis de Tocqueville, who wrote the book Democracy in America, and he said that, and I'm quoting, he said, everyone in America has the vote and is a contributor to lawmaking.
[02:11:03.261 --> 02:11:05.542]  Anyone wishing to change
[02:11:06.696 --> 02:11:08.837]  The law must take one of two courses.
[02:11:08.837 --> 02:11:14.540]  They must either change the nation's opinion or trample its wishes under foot.
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:15.840]  And that's what the leftists do.
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:17.381]  That's what Obama did.
[02:11:17.381 --> 02:11:20.702]  And that's what the DOJ and FBI and Comey were up to.
[02:11:20.702 --> 02:11:26.025]  They were trying to trample the will of the voters to destroy American democracy.
[02:11:26.025 --> 02:11:30.707]  Trump was the first one of all the Republicans you'll see in the film and, you know, in Trump, the art of the insult.
[02:11:31.303 --> 02:11:34.565]  You'll see that he stood up to everybody.
[02:11:34.565 --> 02:11:35.966]  He wouldn't back down.
[02:11:35.966 --> 02:11:37.566]  He wouldn't apologize.
[02:11:37.566 --> 02:11:46.651]  And by doing so, he was able to defeat all the Republican establishment, as well as the radical left and the entire media complex.
[02:11:46.651 --> 02:11:51.174]  And even then, just barely, he won by a few points in the end.
[02:11:51.174 --> 02:11:56.416]  And when you see the film, by the way, you'll see how he defeated the Republican establishment.
[02:11:56.416 --> 02:11:57.257]  Even Ted Cruz
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:02.044]  Who was really the outsider candidate at the beginning of the election.
[02:12:02.044 --> 02:12:04.106]  He was the anti-establishment hero.
[02:12:04.106 --> 02:12:09.391]  He had stood up to Obama, red green eggs and ham on the Senate floor.
[02:12:09.391 --> 02:12:11.072]  And the election really was his to lose.
[02:12:11.072 --> 02:12:12.974]  I actually told him that personally.
[02:12:12.974 --> 02:12:15.897]  He just needed to be Ted Cruz, the outsider, the rebel.
[02:12:15.897 --> 02:12:17.678]  Mr. Cruz goes to Washington.
[02:12:17.678 --> 02:12:20.141]  But Cruz instead chose this establishment route.
[02:12:20.141 --> 02:12:21.462]  He wanted to be Jeb Bush.
[02:12:21.462 --> 02:12:23.144]  He wanted to be this mainstream guy.
[02:12:23.844 --> 02:12:28.366]  And Trump came along and he said, OK, if you don't want to be Ted Cruz, I'll be Ted Cruz.
[02:12:28.366 --> 02:12:33.607]  So really, the Drain the Swamp guy was Ted Cruz and Trump took over that persona.
[02:12:33.607 --> 02:12:37.088]  And when you see the film, you'll see how he destroyed Cruz and everyone else.
[02:12:37.088 --> 02:12:44.431]  And by the way, I've screened this film to people that are Democrats and liberals, and they actually enjoyed the film.
[02:12:44.431 --> 02:12:48.992]  Now, I'll admit it was for different reasons than Republicans might enjoy the film.
[02:12:48.992 --> 02:12:51.353]  But it's not like my film Dreams from My Real Father.
[02:12:52.285 --> 02:12:55.267]  Liberals would run out of the room screaming after three minutes.
[02:12:55.267 --> 02:12:57.708]  They would say, oh, I don't want to know, I don't want to know.
[02:12:57.708 --> 02:13:01.530]  But with this movie, they'll actually sit through the whole thing and enjoy it as well.
[02:13:01.530 --> 02:13:06.812]  So you should get it and show it to your liberal friends and they should be able to take it.
[02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:17.237]  And I'm glad you brought that up because I know a lot of people who are classic liberals, but believe the Democratic Party because they were anti-war and they believe in taking care of the poor.
[02:13:17.237 --> 02:13:20.359]  And the Republican Party's been a really kind of nasty group of blue bloods.
[02:13:21.496 --> 02:13:22.557]  That have had their own problems.
[02:13:22.557 --> 02:13:28.041]  But like you said, the Bill Air's takeover starting in the late 60s is pretty much complete now.
[02:13:28.041 --> 02:13:37.448]  And most of the liberals I know now say they and all their friends absolutely are just disillusioned with the Democratic Party and what's going on.
[02:13:37.448 --> 02:13:43.452]  And it's all a bunch of really old globalist fossils as well.
[02:13:43.452 --> 02:13:45.414]  So where do you see the Democratic Party going?
[02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:54.499]  I think the Democrat Party, unfortunately, has been infiltrated and reinforced on every level by far-left radicals.
[02:13:54.499 --> 02:13:57.663]  The Black Lives Matter is mainstream Democrat politics.
[02:13:57.663 --> 02:14:00.647]  Antifa, mainstream Democrat politics.
[02:14:00.647 --> 02:14:01.408]  Bernie Sanders.
[02:14:01.929 --> 02:14:05.350]  Stalinist, old school communist is one of their leaders.
[02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:09.371]  People showed up at his rallies and they clapped, they cheered.
[02:14:09.371 --> 02:14:14.653]  He talked about we're going to take over the banks, break up the pharmaceutical companies.
[02:14:14.653 --> 02:14:15.833]  That's pure communism.
[02:14:15.833 --> 02:14:19.554]  That's what they did back in the days of Bolshevism in Russia.
[02:14:20.723 --> 02:14:27.165]  Put all the bourgeois, as they called them, the entrepreneurs, they put them in jail and government took over industry.
[02:14:27.165 --> 02:14:30.426]  And of course, government bureaucrats aren't productive.
[02:14:30.426 --> 02:14:34.207]  So all the industries were destroyed and people ended up starving to death.
[02:14:34.207 --> 02:14:41.390]  But people show up to these Bernie Sanders rallies and they clap as if this is a solution that makes any sense in economics.
[02:14:41.390 --> 02:14:41.950]  And it doesn't.
[02:14:41.950 --> 02:14:44.851]  So I see the Democrat Party as going farther and farther left.
[02:14:45.632 --> 02:14:50.481]  And if the Republicans get rid of all this never Trump nonsense and...
[02:14:51.411 --> 02:14:56.175]  Solidify themselves behind the conservative agenda that Trump is promoting.
[02:14:56.175 --> 02:14:59.937]  And it's no different from the agenda that Republicans have been talking about for 10 years.
[02:14:59.937 --> 02:15:03.840]  Well sure, Trump sounds like JFK and his tax policies and all of it.
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:05.802]  I mean, you see what this party's turned into.
[02:15:05.802 --> 02:15:08.664]  And even the Democrats admit they're hated, they're a joke.
[02:15:08.664 --> 02:15:12.387]  They just spew the most nasty, made-up crap at people.
[02:15:12.387 --> 02:15:14.048]  Agree with me or you're a Nazi.
[02:15:14.048 --> 02:15:15.329]  And people are sick of that crud.
[02:15:16.061 --> 02:15:18.582]  Well, JFK, don't forget, was a big anti-communist.
[02:15:18.582 --> 02:15:22.504]  That's why the radical left, Bill Ayers, Weather Underground, they hated JFK.
[02:15:22.504 --> 02:15:26.066]  They hated Robert Kennedy because they were anti-communist.
[02:15:26.066 --> 02:15:32.489]  The movement, the leftist movement in this country, is a very dangerous thing.
[02:15:32.489 --> 02:15:36.951]  They've been attacking all the institutions of democracy, attacking police.
[02:15:36.951 --> 02:15:38.792]  It's almost as if we're back in the late 60s where
[02:15:40.032 --> 02:15:44.094]  The weather underground is here, but they're in the person of the Democrat Party.
[02:15:44.094 --> 02:15:49.155]  I was about to say, you go to these Democrat rallies, you see a half million people want to kill you.
[02:15:49.155 --> 02:15:52.917]  And they're like spitting and just yelling like mental patients.
[02:15:54.215 --> 02:15:56.798]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:15:56.798 --> 02:15:58.940]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:00.923]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:16:00.923 --> 02:16:02.985]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.

[02:19:58.187 --> 02:20:00.869]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:06.244 --> 02:20:12.766]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:12.766 --> 02:20:18.628]  It was the Republicans back in 1994 that shut the government down and it hurt them.
[02:20:18.628 --> 02:20:21.149]  People didn't want obstructionism, they wanted the economy back.
[02:20:21.149 --> 02:20:24.991]  And Bill Clinton sounded more like Trump back then.
[02:20:24.991 --> 02:20:27.992]  Oh, we're gonna have a good economy and all the rest of it.
[02:20:27.992 --> 02:20:31.813]  Socially, they did some bad stuff, but they did do some things to try to boost the economy, but it was artificial.
[02:20:33.183 --> 02:20:39.189]  But that said, the Democrats, as we thought earlier, they didn't block the vote to limit debate.
[02:20:39.189 --> 02:20:46.416]  And so now they've aided a 16 gone through and said they're going to move forward with the vote later today.
[02:20:46.416 --> 02:20:51.181]  So the word is the Dems give up showdown fight.
[02:20:51.181 --> 02:20:52.442]  That's what it signaled earlier.
[02:20:53.228 --> 02:20:57.489]  Normally when they start giving up on all these votes, towards the final vote later today, it shows that.
[02:20:57.489 --> 02:20:59.690]  I want to go to phone calls with Joel Gilbert.
[02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:03.532]  He's not just a filmmaker, he's a great patriot and a really smart analyst.
[02:21:03.532 --> 02:21:13.475]  Before we go to these calls, this segment and the next, then I'll let you go and I've got some final news I'm going to hit before our other host takes over.
[02:21:13.475 --> 02:21:17.036]  What do you make of the Democrats and their tactics?
[02:21:17.036 --> 02:21:19.177]  Because you talk about how their tactics don't work anymore.
[02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:29.246]  But in their own echo chambers, Democrats didn't used to look this mentally ill and this stupid and this ugly.
[02:21:29.246 --> 02:21:30.387]  And I don't say that with pleasure.
[02:21:30.387 --> 02:21:39.213]  I go out and see throngs of people acting like animals and being really mean and vicious and really acting like the fascists they talk about.
[02:21:39.213 --> 02:21:41.275]  And I wonder what happened to them.
[02:21:41.275 --> 02:21:43.076]  How did they get radicalized so quickly?
[02:21:44.505 --> 02:21:50.188]  Well, because their policies don't work, they've been proven to be disastrous for everybody.
[02:21:50.188 --> 02:21:56.472]  Poor people, rich people, any leftist country, you're going to be bankrupt.
[02:21:56.472 --> 02:21:59.493]  The country's going to be bankrupt, you're going to have a lot of poverty.
[02:21:59.493 --> 02:22:07.638]  So because they know their policies don't work, they have cast the entire political battlefield into good versus evil.
[02:22:07.638 --> 02:22:11.060]  So these people feel that they're an army of saints, they're an army of do-gooders,
[02:22:11.730 --> 02:22:13.251]  They represent values.
[02:22:13.251 --> 02:22:17.615]  Every time you hear a Democrat politician, they always talk about our values.
[02:22:17.615 --> 02:22:19.096]  Their values are good.
[02:22:19.096 --> 02:22:20.837]  Everyone else is evil.
[02:22:20.837 --> 02:22:28.443]  And because they believe this narrative of good and evil, if you believe that you were going to save the world by getting rid of Trump,
[02:22:29.463 --> 02:22:35.567]  And you're going to create a perfect future, you might commit some crimes too, because paradise is waiting for you.
[02:22:35.567 --> 02:22:43.972]  It's not different from the Islamist ideology that if you kill in the name of jihad, that you'll reach this paradise in the afterlife.
[02:22:43.972 --> 02:22:52.957]  The only difference between the leftists and the Islamists is the leftists believe they'll achieve paradise on earth, whereas for Islamists, it's paradise in the next world.
[02:22:55.984 --> 02:22:57.427]  Joe Gilbert, you are hired.
[02:22:57.427 --> 02:22:58.789]  You are so dead on.
[02:22:58.789 --> 02:23:04.178]  And that's why the left is completely allied with the most radical forms of Islam and Linda Sorcerer and others.
[02:23:05.862 --> 02:23:13.668]  Attacked the women who were mainly leading demonstrations wanting freedom in Tehran, getting shot and killed and arrested and tortured.
[02:23:13.668 --> 02:23:16.950]  And Soros said, oh, it's a stunt, them taking their hijabs off.
[02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:20.553]  Well, she's got her hijab on, leading the women's march in New York.
[02:23:20.553 --> 02:23:29.600]  It is obscene that Soros could put her in at the front and he funds her and the women line up behind her like baby ducks.
[02:23:30.902 --> 02:23:32.363]  Well, A.J.
[02:23:32.363 --> 02:23:43.352]  Webberman has put together a website, I think it's sarsour.net, where he exposes, he has a book called A Jihad Growing in Brooklyn that's very interesting.
[02:23:43.352 --> 02:23:58.605]  But bringing in people, large groups of people from Muslim countries, open borders, all of this is part of the tactic of the left because they know traditional Americans will never follow their disastrous policies
[02:23:59.145 --> 02:24:16.072]  They hope to replace traditional Americans and outvote them with immigrants, undocumented immigrants, people from Muslim countries, poorer countries, so that these people will, they believe, will vote Democrat because they will want the bigger government services.
[02:24:16.072 --> 02:24:16.832]  Well, exactly.
[02:24:16.832 --> 02:24:19.534]  The thing is, we could have people from all over.
[02:24:19.534 --> 02:24:23.095]  If they didn't get indoctrinated, but they got introduced to free market, they'd be great.
[02:24:23.095 --> 02:24:27.277]  But instead, we have to oppose it because they are being turned into a mob of frothing crazies.
[02:24:29.088 --> 02:24:47.413]  Uh, that's part of the, uh, you know, that's part of the trip of the radical left is to bring in as many low income, low wage, unskilled workers as possible because they know they'll get about 90% of them voting for Democrats who will not only promise them extra free services, health care and so on.
[02:24:47.413 --> 02:24:50.154]  They're also promising them this perfect future.
[02:24:50.154 --> 02:24:51.714]  And that's why you see that the left.
[02:24:52.214 --> 02:24:52.494]  I think?
[02:25:11.705 --> 02:25:21.956]  I was about to say, Sir told them last year's and this year's march, no Christian women allowed, and they wouldn't let you march with them.
[02:25:21.956 --> 02:25:25.240]  They throw you out even though it's your right to march, even if you're wearing a pro-life shirt.
[02:25:26.243 --> 02:25:35.315]  Yeah, they really are borderline on the race selection system.
[02:25:35.315 --> 02:25:41.463]  If you look at Nazi Germany, how they started out by dividing everyone by race and racial
[02:25:43.126 --> 02:25:43.426]  I think?
[02:25:59.129 --> 02:26:09.298]  And get the large masses to follow them with this identity politics idea, which really is a racial agenda, a racial and religious agenda to divide people.
[02:26:09.298 --> 02:26:09.919]  Exactly.
[02:26:09.919 --> 02:26:18.827]  They are following, because when the Nazis first got in, it was on, you know, supposedly recovering all this other stuff and Versailles Treaty, but it was a socialist program.
[02:26:18.827 --> 02:26:19.588]  And they said that.
[02:26:20.248 --> 02:26:24.953]  We're just going to get everybody in their group so we can categorize you for the census and stuff, and IBM helped.
[02:26:24.953 --> 02:26:28.517]  And then they used, once everybody in their own group, that's when they started the persecution.
[02:26:28.517 --> 02:26:33.742]  And so the Democrats are literally getting us all to do the opposite of what Martin Luther King did.
[02:26:33.742 --> 02:26:37.086]  They're getting us to literally identify as a group.
[02:26:38.311 --> 02:26:45.954]  Right, Martin Luther King believed that we will judge people by the strength of their character, not by the color of their skin.
[02:26:45.954 --> 02:26:48.575]  A very noble, very American idea.
[02:26:48.575 --> 02:26:50.856]  That's why we have Martin Luther King Day.
[02:26:50.856 --> 02:27:04.222]  It's not for radicals like Barack Obama and all of his minions who run around saying that, well, you know, he had something on his campaign website, African Americans for Obama.
[02:27:05.182 --> 02:27:06.463]  Muslims for Obama.
[02:27:06.463 --> 02:27:19.391]  It was all about dividing people and identifying their race and it is very racist to tell people you have to believe in socialism and communism if you're this skin color or this religion.
[02:27:19.391 --> 02:27:25.435]  It's gone so far in the opposite direction and again it's because the Democrat leftist policies do not work.
[02:27:25.435 --> 02:27:27.956]  You're right and it's extremely patronizing.
[02:27:27.956 --> 02:27:31.778]  It's very patronizing to how they talk down to these groups.
[02:27:31.778 --> 02:27:32.319]  It's sick!
[02:27:33.752 --> 02:27:40.841]  Yeah, there was this guy named, I think his first name is Paris, he's an African American that was a Trump supporter, and he was on CNN.
[02:27:41.872 --> 02:27:44.394]  Explaining Trump's policies during the election.
[02:27:44.394 --> 02:27:49.497]  And this white professor from some Ivy League school said, you're a disgrace to your race.
[02:27:49.497 --> 02:27:51.599]  How dare you support Donald Trump?
[02:27:51.599 --> 02:27:53.020]  And of course he was very offended.
[02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:58.804]  He said, how dare you say that I have to believe in socialism and your nonsense because of my skin color?
[02:27:58.804 --> 02:28:06.609]  It's pure racism to cast black people at anybody that they have to support some crazy leftist agenda because of their race.
[02:28:06.749 --> 02:28:07.910]  And think how racist that is.
[02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:08.651]  Yeah, we have that video.
[02:28:08.651 --> 02:28:10.472]  We probably ought to grab that and play it next segment.
[02:28:10.472 --> 02:28:14.956]  I mean, that is the ultimate racist thing to say to a black person or a white person or anybody.
[02:28:14.956 --> 02:28:19.980]  You're a disgrace to your race when it's the human race because you're not doing what I tell you to do.
[02:28:19.980 --> 02:28:20.961]  That is crazy.
[02:28:20.961 --> 02:28:22.462]  They think they own black people.
[02:28:23.757 --> 02:28:26.399]  Well, America is a great ideal.
[02:28:26.399 --> 02:28:40.448]  It's a country that brought together people of all races, all religions, toward a goal of free markets, free religion, building an entrepreneurial, individualistic economy where people can pursue happiness and community.
[02:28:40.448 --> 02:28:44.731]  And the Republican Party, the conservative agenda, embodies this.
[02:28:44.731 --> 02:28:49.614]  And the Democrat leftist agenda is something that is becoming very anti-American.
[02:28:49.614 --> 02:28:50.795]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:50.795 --> 02:28:51.836]  We're going right to your calls.

[02:31:03.945 --> 02:31:08.528]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:31:08.528 --> 02:31:11.650]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:31:11.650 --> 02:31:14.773]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:31:16.283 --> 02:31:16.403]  Yeah.
[02:31:36.861 --> 02:31:45.164]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[02:31:48.885 --> 02:31:51.166]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:31:51.166 --> 02:31:53.427]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[02:31:55.643 --> 02:31:57.085]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:57.085 --> 02:31:58.406]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:58.406 --> 02:31:59.607]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:59.607 --> 02:32:04.911]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:04.911 --> 02:32:18.442]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:18.442 --> 02:32:19.804]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:32:20.724 --> 02:32:22.225]  Spreading disease around.
[02:32:22.225 --> 02:32:24.805]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:24.805 --> 02:32:26.106]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:26.106 --> 02:32:27.206]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:32:27.206 --> 02:32:28.546]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:28.546 --> 02:32:33.048]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:33.048 --> 02:32:36.309]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:36.309 --> 02:32:39.390]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:39.390 --> 02:32:40.430]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:40.430 --> 02:32:42.371]  LivingDefense, InfowarsLife.com.
[02:32:42.371 --> 02:32:43.411]  And folks, you can't lose.

[02:32:47.994 --> 02:32:49.356]  Infowarslives.com.
[02:32:49.356 --> 02:32:51.600]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:57.649]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:32:57.649 --> 02:33:00.253]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:12.948 --> 02:33:20.255]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.255 --> 02:33:24.359]  We posted the trailer at Infowarstore.com.
[02:33:24.359 --> 02:33:26.562]  We're going to put banners up on the front page of the site.
[02:33:26.562 --> 02:33:27.643]  I'm really going to promote this film.
[02:33:27.643 --> 02:33:28.964]  I'm going to put some ads out as well.
[02:33:28.964 --> 02:33:32.027]  Because it's, I mean, all his films are amazing.
[02:33:32.027 --> 02:33:36.711]  Dreams of My Real Father, his film Utopia, about the communist nightmare.
[02:33:37.970 --> 02:33:39.552]  No place like Utopia.
[02:33:39.552 --> 02:33:41.154]  The art of the insult.
[02:33:41.154 --> 02:33:42.496]  Standing up to bullies.
[02:33:42.496 --> 02:33:43.597]  You need to see this film.
[02:33:43.597 --> 02:33:44.338]  It's amazing.
[02:33:44.338 --> 02:33:44.999]  It's hilarious.
[02:33:44.999 --> 02:33:45.699]  You're gonna laugh for...
[02:33:46.661 --> 02:33:51.325]  Much of 95 Minutes, InfowarsStore.com, and that helps fund our operation.
[02:33:51.325 --> 02:33:53.047]  No reviews yet, because it just went up today.
[02:33:53.047 --> 02:33:53.968]  I know we have the trailer.
[02:33:53.968 --> 02:34:00.054]  Let's make sure we embed the trailer, or the trailer I'm going to cut for it there, because everybody needs to see the film.
[02:34:00.054 --> 02:34:01.635]  Okay, Joel Gilbert is our guest.
[02:34:01.635 --> 02:34:08.361]  Thank you for holding, George and Mike and Jason and Chris and Lee and Marcos and John and Mackenzie.
[02:34:08.361 --> 02:34:10.664]  We'll at least get to those calls here while we have our guest.
[02:34:13.595 --> 02:34:15.816]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in New York.
[02:34:15.816 --> 02:34:18.838]  You're on the air with Joel Gilbert.
[02:34:18.838 --> 02:34:19.759]  Hey, what's going on?
[02:34:19.759 --> 02:34:22.181]  This is Mike from Queens, Donald Trump's hometown.
[02:34:22.181 --> 02:34:22.881]  God bless you, brother.
[02:34:22.881 --> 02:34:24.602]  What's on your mind?
[02:34:24.602 --> 02:34:25.042]  None, none.
[02:34:25.042 --> 02:34:26.383]  Just wanted to talk about the names.
[02:34:26.383 --> 02:34:31.707]  Some of the names he came out with, like Larry Watson for Elizabeth Warren and John Kasich.
[02:34:31.707 --> 02:34:38.071]  It's really not a name, but it was pretty funny when he pointed out the fact that he was shoveling pancakes in his mouth like it was his last meal.
[02:34:38.888 --> 02:34:44.911]  You know, things like that are what Americans remember, you know, especially when you're out there, you know, trying to reach people.
[02:34:44.911 --> 02:34:52.214]  And that's what we need, is somebody that's unconventional, not somebody that... What Joel said earlier, Trump doesn't want to be part of the establishment.
[02:34:52.214 --> 02:34:55.976]  He knows they're a bunch of stuffed shirts and a bunch of self-important weirdos.
[02:34:55.976 --> 02:34:58.877]  Trump's known for hanging out with blue-collar workers because they're fun.
[02:34:59.577 --> 02:35:00.959]  And, you know, that's what we need.
[02:35:00.959 --> 02:35:02.960]  I'm sorry, I've seen the top of Hollywood.
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.102]  I've seen the top of it all.
[02:35:04.102 --> 02:35:05.043]  It's super boring.
[02:35:05.043 --> 02:35:06.124]  It all sucks.
[02:35:06.124 --> 02:35:10.668]  Trump knows that, and that's what you need to know about Trump, is that he likes to work.
[02:35:10.668 --> 02:35:12.029]  He likes to do things.
[02:35:12.029 --> 02:35:13.291]  He likes to be real.
[02:35:13.291 --> 02:35:14.432]  And he likes women.
[02:35:14.432 --> 02:35:18.215]  And, you know, everybody's sick of hypocrites, and Trump's not a hypocrite.
[02:35:18.215 --> 02:35:19.116]  Great point, Mike.
[02:35:19.116 --> 02:35:19.717]  Joel Gilbert?
[02:35:20.942 --> 02:35:35.267]  Yeah, actually, there was a nickname for John Kasich, besides making fun of his disgusting eating habits, called Kasich One for 41, because he only won his home state of Ohio and insisted on staying in the race, staying in the race.
[02:35:35.267 --> 02:35:41.089]  And then he cut a deal with Ted Cruz in Indiana and told people, don't vote for Trump, vote for one of us.
[02:35:41.089 --> 02:35:47.511]  And that failed so miserably, Kasich and Cruz were out of the race as soon as the polls closed.
[02:35:47.731 --> 02:35:48.712]  Thank you so much, Mike.
[02:35:48.712 --> 02:35:51.293]  But notice, a year later, Trump is delivering.
[02:35:51.293 --> 02:35:53.934]  I can't say how anybody could be bitching at this point.
[02:35:53.934 --> 02:35:56.475]  But man, what if they're able to implode the economy, Joel?
[02:35:56.475 --> 02:35:57.436]  What's going to happen then?
[02:35:57.436 --> 02:35:59.377]  Oh my God.
[02:35:59.377 --> 02:36:02.679]  Well, you could almost argue that this is the resistance.
[02:36:04.128 --> 02:36:12.554]  They probably cannot deal with the fact that people are going to be happy over the tax cuts and not be able to deal with all the success of the economy and the stock market.
[02:36:12.554 --> 02:36:15.637]  So all they're left with is shut down the government.
[02:36:15.637 --> 02:36:16.517]  Shut down the government.
[02:36:16.517 --> 02:36:20.440]  It's hard for me to believe that it's going to stay open all year long.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:21.981]  It's probably going to keep shutting down.
[02:36:21.981 --> 02:36:24.223]  They're going to prevent Trump from having a budget.
[02:36:24.223 --> 02:36:27.565]  And again, China is cheerleading it, hoping we fail.
[02:36:27.565 --> 02:36:29.347]  And the Democrats are with the Communist Chinese.
[02:36:30.728 --> 02:36:35.711]  Well, shutting down the government is a resistance tactic.
[02:36:35.711 --> 02:36:44.696]  That's the only way they have left to keep the success of Donald Trump from permeating the American economy and the American psyche.
[02:36:44.696 --> 02:36:49.738]  If he stays in power and does well, the Democrat Party is finished for another generation.
[02:36:49.738 --> 02:36:50.359]  Great point.
[02:36:50.359 --> 02:36:52.100]  Okay, let's go to Christian in Tennessee.
[02:36:52.100 --> 02:36:53.380]  You're on the air with Joel Gilbert.
[02:36:53.380 --> 02:36:54.441]  Go ahead, Christian.
[02:36:55.626 --> 02:36:56.587]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:36:56.587 --> 02:36:57.608]  Good, brother.
[02:36:57.608 --> 02:36:58.890]  Huge fan.
[02:36:58.890 --> 02:37:00.953]  I got one quick point to make real quick.
[02:37:00.953 --> 02:37:02.234]  Sure.
[02:37:02.234 --> 02:37:08.161]  Alex, when do you plan on announcing the winner of the first annual People's Choice Awards?
[02:37:08.161 --> 02:37:09.603]  We are totally overwhelmed.
[02:37:09.603 --> 02:37:11.245]  I gave the guys a blueprint, but then...
[02:37:12.413 --> 02:37:16.758]  I want to watch the whole thing because I want to find the guy that called and said it was turning the economy on.
[02:37:16.758 --> 02:37:17.899]  That's the biggest story.
[02:37:17.899 --> 02:37:20.582]  And then that's what Trump went with, number one.
[02:37:20.582 --> 02:37:25.548]  But I may just have to give it to other folks because I'm going to try to do it today or tomorrow.
[02:37:25.548 --> 02:37:26.389]  Thank you for reminding me.
[02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:27.470]  I'm sorry.
[02:37:27.470 --> 02:37:28.171]  Well, you're fine.
[02:37:28.171 --> 02:37:30.434]  And Doug, I'm a huge fan.
[02:37:30.434 --> 02:37:31.475]  You know, one of my favorite
[02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:36.782]  Nicknames is Barry Davis Obama.
[02:37:36.782 --> 02:37:55.713]  And for all you people out there that want to accuse Alex of being a Jew this or a Jesuit this, you know, Obama was tutored by Greg Galuzzo of the Gamaliel Foundation, who was a Jesuit, but they had to throw in Gamaliel to make it sound Jewish.
[02:37:55.713 --> 02:38:00.335]  And, you know, if you were a co-jeweler there, Alex, you'd be a good one after 25 years.
[02:38:01.934 --> 02:38:14.120]  Well, listen, my biggest issue is, I've noticed it's the left that uses the race politics and constantly invokes it, like the left will walk into a conservative store, a gun shop, and say, do you let, you know, K-words in just to start a fight?
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:19.042]  They're the ones, the left, I never heard the N-word until I went up north and was around leftists.
[02:38:19.042 --> 02:38:24.245]  I'm not bashing northerners, I'm just saying that's where I first heard it, and it's just, that's all they hide.
[02:38:24.245 --> 02:38:25.565]  Thank you, Christian.
[02:38:25.565 --> 02:38:28.507]  Let's talk to Marcos in Fort Worth, Texas.
[02:38:28.507 --> 02:38:30.688]  Marcos, you're on the air with Mr. Gilbert and Alex Jones.
[02:38:30.688 --> 02:38:30.968]  Go ahead.
[02:38:32.458 --> 02:38:35.961]  I'm just trying to stay away from these PBGs, Alex.
[02:38:35.961 --> 02:38:38.604]  Okay, what's a potbelly pedophile?
[02:38:38.604 --> 02:38:43.288]  Potbelly goblins, potbelly pedophiles, potbelly everybody's.
[02:38:43.288 --> 02:38:45.090]  And again, nobody's bad if they have a potbelly.
[02:38:45.090 --> 02:38:46.751]  I have a little bit of one.
[02:38:46.751 --> 02:38:52.777]  There's something about these leftists and these pedophiles, every time they get busted, they look like, that's why I call them PBPs, yeah.
[02:38:53.539 --> 02:38:54.099]  I love it.
[02:38:54.099 --> 02:38:54.559]  I love it.
[02:38:54.559 --> 02:38:57.320]  And that's the art of the insult in itself, within itself.
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:38:58.081]  That's the importance.
[02:38:58.081 --> 02:39:04.523]  Well, it is true that these people that attack us at the Lepus events look like goblins.
[02:39:04.523 --> 02:39:05.984]  And so, I don't know why.
[02:39:05.984 --> 02:39:07.124]  In fact, there's a new one.
[02:39:07.124 --> 02:39:08.045]  It's on InfoWars.
[02:39:08.045 --> 02:39:10.345]  Goblin creature attacks InfoWars reporters.
[02:39:10.345 --> 02:39:11.606]  And he looks like a goblin.
[02:39:21.028 --> 02:39:25.689]  Well, you know, part of this is really sad because, I mean, look, in fact, I see a caller there.
[02:39:25.689 --> 02:39:29.650]  George says, uh, left using protests to turn unemployed against Trump.
[02:39:29.650 --> 02:39:35.771]  I think these are really desperate people who totally live off the system and they think we're trying to kill them.
[02:39:35.771 --> 02:39:36.511]  They don't understand.
[02:39:36.511 --> 02:39:37.451]  Thank you, Marcos.
[02:39:37.451 --> 02:39:39.031]  Great points.
[02:39:39.031 --> 02:39:41.672]  Goblins is a great nickname for the left, but only because it fits.
[02:39:42.453 --> 02:39:44.280]  I mean, see the guy that attacked me in Seattle?
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:44.882]  These new guys?
[02:39:44.882 --> 02:39:46.087]  They look like goblins, Joel!
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:53.603]  Well, people remember from my Utopia film, there's a theory from the 60s from Francis Fox Piven.
[02:39:53.603 --> 02:39:54.263]  I'm sure you know it.
[02:39:54.263 --> 02:39:56.324]  It's called the weight of the poor.
[02:39:56.324 --> 02:40:08.931]  And what the Democrats did in New York in the mid-70s is they tried to destroy business, run business out of town, and put as many people on welfare as they could in order to crash the system.
[02:40:08.931 --> 02:40:11.392]  And that's how they bankrupted New York City.
[02:40:11.392 --> 02:40:13.653]  And that is a strategy Obama was using.
[02:40:13.653 --> 02:40:16.014]  He put an extra 20 million people on food stamps.
[02:40:16.014 --> 02:40:17.035]  Well, that's Cloward and Piven.
[02:40:17.699 --> 02:40:18.079]  That's
[02:40:33.949 --> 02:40:35.070]  That's right, absolutely.
[02:40:35.070 --> 02:40:35.870]  Let's go ahead and go to...
[02:41:01.849 --> 02:41:05.232]  John in Boston, in the great city of Boston.
[02:41:05.232 --> 02:41:07.314]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:41:07.314 --> 02:41:09.856]  Alex, it's great to talk to you from Texas.
[02:41:09.856 --> 02:41:10.717]  I love you, man.
[02:41:10.717 --> 02:41:11.518]  I love InfoWars.
[02:41:11.518 --> 02:41:12.599]  I pray for you daily.
[02:41:12.599 --> 02:41:14.060]  Thank you.
[02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:20.406]  I think that it's very important for Donald Trump, if he's going to release the memo, to do it during the State of the Union address.
[02:41:20.888 --> 02:41:27.738]  Where he has full coverage from CNN, MSNBC, and forces them into talking about it.
[02:41:27.738 --> 02:41:28.779]  That is a great idea!
[02:41:28.779 --> 02:41:34.427]  He should talk about the abuses, the fraud, catching the FBI at the top, organizing the fraud.
[02:41:34.427 --> 02:41:34.908]  We have them.
[02:41:35.919 --> 02:41:37.580]  The true State of the Union.
[02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:43.384]  Let us know everything that's going on behind the scenes rather than going out there and talking about the stock market and everything.
[02:41:43.384 --> 02:41:45.866]  I mean, he's done amazing things and anybody with eyes.
[02:41:45.866 --> 02:41:46.227]  No, I agree.
[02:41:46.227 --> 02:41:52.371]  He should open up with the positive things and thank the American people and thank the military and everybody else.
[02:41:52.371 --> 02:42:01.718]  And then he should get into the facts and just indict them all for criminals that tried to bring the country down.
[02:42:01.718 --> 02:42:03.119]  I would also agree.
[02:42:03.119 --> 02:42:03.279]  Joe?
[02:42:04.221 --> 02:42:15.548]  Yeah, I would add that that's just the ongoing battle against the mainstream media, against lies, against a narrative to trick people.
[02:42:15.548 --> 02:42:24.074]  The mainstream media wake up every day and they say, how can we fool the people who read us and listen to us into believing in the leftist Democrat agenda?
[02:42:24.074 --> 02:42:25.134]  I've been through it.
[02:42:25.134 --> 02:42:27.456]  I even had the FEC, Federal Election Commission,
[02:42:28.096 --> 02:42:33.201]  Uh, tried to, uh, uh, prosecute me for making the film, uh, Dreams From My Real Life.
[02:42:33.201 --> 02:42:35.022]  That was in the news, and that was in WikiLeaks.
[02:42:35.022 --> 02:42:41.168]  They wanted you particularly arrested, which is why we know you're a good guy and winning.
[02:42:41.168 --> 02:42:45.732]  Because if they're not trying to put you in jail, well, you're not on Team America.
[02:42:45.732 --> 02:42:46.773]  Thank you so much, John.
[02:42:46.773 --> 02:42:47.053]  Stay there.
[02:42:47.053 --> 02:42:48.514]  If you got anything else, I'll come right back to John.
[02:42:48.514 --> 02:42:50.916]  We'll do another segment with the one and only Joel Gilbert.
[02:42:50.916 --> 02:42:52.698]  Get the new film at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:42:54.252 --> 02:42:57.734]  InfoWars Live is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:42:57.734 --> 02:43:09.241]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[02:43:09.241 --> 02:43:10.122]  This is pollen blood.
[02:43:11.162 --> 02:43:23.810]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucous production.
[02:43:23.810 --> 02:43:28.152]  They began studying the effects in published trials.
[02:43:28.152 --> 02:43:32.155]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet
[02:43:32.615 --> 02:43:42.704]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and Fast-Acting Pollen Block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[02:43:42.704 --> 02:43:45.847]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with Fast-Acting Pollen Block.
[02:43:45.847 --> 02:43:52.833]  Available now at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free.
[02:43:52.833 --> 02:43:54.054]  888-253-3139.
[02:43:54.054 --> 02:43:56.136]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:56.136 --> 02:43:56.436]  Go ahead.
[02:43:57.475 --> 02:43:58.936]  I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:58.936 --> 02:44:02.819]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:44:02.819 --> 02:44:04.240]  It just gets old, man.
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:06.682]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:44:06.682 --> 02:44:08.983]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:44:08.983 --> 02:44:13.007]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:44:13.007 --> 02:44:15.429]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:44:16.289 --> 02:44:18.610]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:44:18.610 --> 02:44:20.331]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:44:20.331 --> 02:44:21.451]  Us being shut down?
[02:44:21.451 --> 02:44:22.932]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:44:22.932 --> 02:44:23.992]  You know what, Alex?
[02:44:23.992 --> 02:44:25.093]  Put him on pause again.
[02:44:25.093 --> 02:44:26.213]  Hey, Frank!
[02:44:26.213 --> 02:44:31.855]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:44:31.855 --> 02:44:36.377]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:44:36.377 --> 02:44:39.538]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:44:39.538 --> 02:44:39.999]  You understand?
[02:44:39.999 --> 02:44:41.619]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:41.619 --> 02:44:42.760]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:43.740 --> 02:44:49.362]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:44:49.362 --> 02:44:50.182]  Do you understand?
[02:44:50.182 --> 02:44:51.723]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:51.723 --> 02:44:55.344]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:44:55.344 --> 02:45:00.486]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[02:45:00.486 --> 02:45:05.267]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:45:05.267 --> 02:45:09.769]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[02:45:10.029 --> 02:45:10.229]  I think?
[02:45:30.282 --> 02:45:33.904]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:45:33.904 --> 02:45:38.626]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:45:38.626 --> 02:45:46.731]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[02:45:46.731 --> 02:45:50.913]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[02:45:50.913 --> 02:45:52.234]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:46:04.411 --> 02:46:10.977]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:46:10.977 --> 02:46:15.642]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[02:46:15.742 --> 02:46:18.464]  Because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:46:46.022 --> 02:46:48.284]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:09.878 --> 02:47:11.379]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:47:11.379 --> 02:47:18.766]  There's video up on Infowars.com of Chelsea Manning showing up at the Patriot event.
[02:47:18.766 --> 02:47:20.948]  It was completely inclusive in New York.
[02:47:20.948 --> 02:47:22.029]  Jack Masovic was there.
[02:47:22.029 --> 02:47:23.390]  He's coming up hosting the fourth hour.
[02:47:23.390 --> 02:47:25.532]  We're going to play some of that video as well.
[02:47:25.532 --> 02:47:28.174]  And everybody was nice to Chelsea Manning.
[02:47:28.174 --> 02:47:35.860]  I mean, if you want to say you're a pink reindeer, or you want to say you're an Easter bunny, or you want to say you're a woman, I don't care.
[02:47:36.874 --> 02:47:42.615]  Just don't try to go teach five-year-olds that to confuse their sexual orientation, which is what the agenda of the globalist is.
[02:47:42.615 --> 02:47:46.716]  Everybody was nice to Chelsea Manning.
[02:47:46.716 --> 02:47:49.416]  Okay, aren't you a pretty girl?
[02:47:49.416 --> 02:47:54.677]  It was Obama put you in prison.
[02:47:54.677 --> 02:48:02.319]  He, she said that it was a horrible, racist, white supremacist event.
[02:48:03.462 --> 02:48:07.224]  Just to go virtue signal, I guess it's a stunt for her.
[02:48:07.224 --> 02:48:08.645]  Senate run.
[02:48:08.645 --> 02:48:12.027]  And I wanted to just hit that before I go back to John and these other callers.
[02:48:12.027 --> 02:48:22.673]  The sexualization of children, the pedophilia in Hollywood, the wanting to target children when they're young, the Tavistock Institute, it's all about population control and I guess just attacking the family.
[02:48:22.673 --> 02:48:24.414]  I'm not saying Chelsea Manning does this.
[02:48:24.414 --> 02:48:24.795]  Chelsea's a
[02:48:25.996 --> 02:48:31.099]  I think, you know, just a by-product of this whole program, but they're really obsessed with that.
[02:48:31.099 --> 02:48:34.141]  That's their next big bet, is to be tolerant.
[02:48:34.141 --> 02:48:43.767]  Let us teach your five-year-old son that he's really a girl and, like Jocelyn Elder said, reach down and touch him and teach him how to do it.
[02:48:43.767 --> 02:48:49.311]  I mean, what's going on in the leftist, diseased mind?
[02:48:49.311 --> 02:48:52.793]  Well, Alex, look, Manning was a traitor.
[02:48:52.793 --> 02:48:53.553]  People forget that.
[02:48:54.875 --> 02:48:55.756]  Was a traitor.
[02:48:55.756 --> 02:48:57.597]  So was Bo Bergdahl.
[02:48:57.597 --> 02:49:04.301]  Uh, both of them, uh, Manning gets let out of prison, uh, despite a very long sentence.
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:07.181]  For treason.
[02:49:07.181 --> 02:49:09.321]  You've got Bo Bergdahl.
[02:49:09.321 --> 02:49:11.642]  People died trying to find him.
[02:49:11.642 --> 02:49:14.643]  And he also gets off.
[02:49:14.643 --> 02:49:21.245]  So nothing can be more illustrative of the Obama administration, the leftist Obama mentality.
[02:49:21.245 --> 02:49:25.407]  But why does Jocelyn Elders want to reach down and touch your child?
[02:49:26.621 --> 02:49:27.742]  Sorry.
[02:49:27.742 --> 02:49:41.428]  Well, this is the sickness of the far left ideology that goes back to the communist movement in the 60s where Marxism is an attack against traditional society.
[02:49:41.428 --> 02:49:41.969]  And B.F.
[02:49:41.969 --> 02:49:42.249]  Skinner.
[02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:45.602]  The family unit no longer exists.
[02:49:45.602 --> 02:49:50.205]  We're going to put you on these collective farms and you're all going to live in this big collective.
[02:49:50.205 --> 02:49:57.090]  You're going to produce more because you're going to be so happy that you're going to make more food and produce more crops.
[02:49:57.090 --> 02:49:58.591]  In China, they tried that of course.
[02:49:58.591 --> 02:50:05.876]  In Ukraine, the government would show up and take all the produce and it turns out everybody starves to death.
[02:50:05.876 --> 02:50:12.661]  So the whole concept to change humanity, to create a new human being that doesn't have a gender
[02:50:13.433 --> 02:50:15.515]  That doesn't want to live in a traditional family.
[02:50:15.515 --> 02:50:25.642]  That you're just an animal living in this collective like a zoo animal with the government being the zookeeper who controls you and everything you think.
[02:50:25.642 --> 02:50:29.745]  It is a anti-life death cult in the end.
[02:50:29.745 --> 02:50:39.171]  150 million people were murdered in peacetime by communist regimes because they wouldn't go along with this collective or they just starve to death on the way to utopia.
[02:50:39.171 --> 02:50:41.773]  You're absolutely right.
[02:50:41.773 --> 02:50:42.554]  The biggest problem is
[02:50:43.837 --> 02:50:54.182]  So many people I know are closeted libertarians or conservatives, but they get censored or they get attacked and they won't even have me on their shows, which I don't need to be on their shows.
[02:50:54.182 --> 02:50:58.004]  It's just the fact that they want to play it safe.
[02:50:58.004 --> 02:51:00.805]  And by playing it safe, that's why we're going to lose.
[02:51:00.805 --> 02:51:02.866]  If we lose, it's all these people playing it safe.
[02:51:04.696 --> 02:51:11.840]  People don't understand, the Never Trumpers, I don't know how they could not understand that if Hillary won, there'd be nothing left of the United States.
[02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:13.521]  There'd be no more conservative movement.
[02:51:13.521 --> 02:51:15.502]  There'd be no more Republicans.
[02:51:15.502 --> 02:51:21.045]  It would be 100% leftist majority in every state where it's just a given.
[02:51:21.045 --> 02:51:27.669]  You'd have all the corruption in Chicago, bankruptcy, horrible education, violent culture.
[02:51:27.669 --> 02:51:29.490]  They were going to bring all the devastation of
[02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:32.291]  And they know it's a culture of corruption.
[02:51:32.291 --> 02:51:34.532]  They're all criminals and exempt themselves from it.
[02:51:34.532 --> 02:51:35.552]  They are mid-level
[02:51:51.353 --> 02:51:56.638]  The Blue Blood Republicans are a bunch of cowards that go along with it.
[02:51:56.638 --> 02:51:58.079]  They're even worse.
[02:51:58.079 --> 02:52:00.362]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Boston.
[02:52:00.362 --> 02:52:01.583]  Go ahead and finish up your point, John.
[02:52:03.477 --> 02:52:14.345]  Alex, you know, it all just comes down to the fact that they worship the devil, and they love the devil, and they're gonna do whatever, you know, isn't in our best interest because of that.
[02:52:14.345 --> 02:52:18.788]  And you look at these pot-bellied goblins you talk about, and the one thing they're missing is God.
[02:52:18.788 --> 02:52:20.830]  You look at their eyes, you can see it.
[02:52:20.830 --> 02:52:22.371]  You know, they're empty, they're hollow.
[02:52:22.891 --> 02:52:25.295]  They don't care about anyone but themselves.
[02:52:25.295 --> 02:52:26.817]  And, you know, it's just really sad.
[02:52:26.817 --> 02:52:31.082]  But, you know, Trump can defeat this by going off script, like you said, not playing it safe.
[02:52:31.082 --> 02:52:36.550]  And I really think reading the FISA memo at the State of the Union is the way to do that.
[02:52:36.550 --> 02:52:37.170]  God bless you.
[02:52:37.170 --> 02:52:37.531]  Absolutely.
[02:52:37.531 --> 02:52:38.713]  That's a great idea, isn't it, Joel?
[02:52:40.762 --> 02:52:50.646]  Don't forget John McCain was exposed again as a Democrat by voting for Obamacare, and he's knee-deep in this whole FISA warrant thing.
[02:52:50.646 --> 02:52:57.269]  Jeff Flake, Flake Jeff Flake, also from Arizona, went on the Senate floor and called Trump Stalin.
[02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:59.350]  He lied about what even Trump said.
[02:52:59.350 --> 02:53:03.172]  Trump said the fake news media was the enemy of the American people.
[02:53:03.172 --> 02:53:06.213]  Flake goes on the Senate floor and says that Trump said the media was.
[02:53:06.773 --> 02:53:15.761]  So, Trump has exposed these establishment Republicans as really being Democrats, and if you go to the Infowars store, I encourage you, you've got to watch the film.
[02:53:15.761 --> 02:53:19.163]  You'll understand Trump like you've never seen him.
[02:53:19.163 --> 02:53:21.846]  No, you're right, because the film's well done.
[02:53:22.506 --> 02:53:23.487]  It's fun.
[02:53:23.487 --> 02:53:29.134]  It progresses as he marches throughout the film, you know, up to the podium, and you see the process of him winning.
[02:53:29.134 --> 02:53:34.320]  And it's really great tactics for all of us that kind of instinctively do this in our own lives.
[02:53:34.320 --> 02:53:39.947]  When somebody messes with me or lies about me, I just snap back with a funny insult, and I make it fun, and they hate that.
[02:53:39.947 --> 02:53:40.647]  It's the same thing.
[02:53:40.647 --> 02:53:41.448]  We're not being nasty.
[02:53:41.448 --> 02:53:42.630]  We're just being, oh, yeah.
[02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:48.714]  You know, but all of us that are successful will watch this and see Trump distilling it.
[02:53:48.714 --> 02:53:50.336]  That's why this film is invaluable.
[02:53:50.336 --> 02:53:54.419]  All your children should see this film and learn how to not let bullies hurt you.
[02:53:54.419 --> 02:53:56.761]  Not even get in a fight with them.
[02:53:56.761 --> 02:53:58.642]  Slap them back with wit.
[02:53:58.642 --> 02:53:59.903]  And you know, that's how you deal with them.
[02:54:00.666 --> 02:54:02.947]  Yeah, Trump had the creativity.
[02:54:02.947 --> 02:54:11.369]  Every day in his sleep, he's falling asleep, he's waking up and tweeting, and when he hits send, they just start to go nuts, and they can't think of anything in response.
[02:54:11.369 --> 02:54:16.030]  All they can do is say, Trump is not very nice, and he had an affair 20 years ago.
[02:54:16.030 --> 02:54:17.010]  That's all they can say.
[02:54:17.010 --> 02:54:21.991]  They don't have an ounce of creativity, and that's why Trump is dominating them every day.
[02:54:21.991 --> 02:54:26.432]  And that's why Christians forgive him, because he's not being a hypocrite either.
[02:54:26.432 --> 02:54:28.613]  He's not up there, it's just unbelievable.
[02:54:30.487 --> 02:54:34.273]  Imagine where we'd be right now, Joel, if Hillary would have gotten elected.
[02:54:34.273 --> 02:54:36.697]  Like you said, it'd be hell on earth right now.
[02:54:36.697 --> 02:54:38.900]  That woman looks like a psychotic demon.
[02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:42.466]  I mean, she just looks like a witch out of a movie.
[02:54:42.466 --> 02:54:43.768]  I mean, she looks crazy!
[02:54:44.930 --> 02:54:48.212]  She was involved in abuse of power for 25 years.
[02:54:48.212 --> 02:54:51.074]  It's been well chronicled in book after book.
[02:54:51.074 --> 02:55:05.624]  Hillary had designs on eliminating every amendment after amendment, eliminating the borders, defeating permanently any opposition to the leftist agenda.
[02:55:05.624 --> 02:55:08.206]  And we went through a very dangerous time and really
[02:55:08.866 --> 02:55:11.750]  Trump won a couple of states by maybe 10,000 votes.
[02:55:11.750 --> 02:55:20.401]  So the United States was on a very dangerous course where it would not have continued ever to be the... I agree.
[02:55:20.401 --> 02:55:24.387]  Can you believe they're getting Mitt Romney out of deep freeze to run for the Senate to go after Trump?
[02:55:25.875 --> 02:55:31.100]  Uh, it's disappointing to think that could happen, but let's see how things play out.
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:34.683]  The Republican base is not stupid, and they know the score.
[02:55:34.683 --> 02:55:41.168]  And when you watch, you know, The Art of the Insult, you'll be inspired yourself, like you said, to stand up to all this leftist bullying.
[02:55:42.129 --> 02:55:44.530]  Absolutely, and that's why the fight's just beginning, folks.
[02:55:44.530 --> 02:55:47.031]  I'm telling you, if you go to sleep listeners, we're done.
[02:55:47.031 --> 02:55:48.731]  You are the heart of the resistance.
[02:55:48.731 --> 02:55:49.872]  I salute you all, and I mean that.
[02:55:49.872 --> 02:55:52.072]  I salute you all, no matter what color you are, where you came from.
[02:55:52.072 --> 02:55:56.854]  If you want free market, if you want a future for everybody, if you're not a devil worshiper, then we're on your side.
[02:55:56.854 --> 02:56:01.055]  And literally, what the caller said, man, you get to the bottom of this, these are evil people.
[02:56:01.055 --> 02:56:02.676]  And they got a bunch of slaves following them.
[02:56:02.676 --> 02:56:04.436]  George in California, thanks for holding.
[02:56:04.436 --> 02:56:05.657]  You're on the air with Joel Gilbert.
[02:56:05.657 --> 02:56:05.917]  Go ahead.
[02:56:07.051 --> 02:56:08.712]  It's nice to talk to you, Alex.
[02:56:08.712 --> 02:56:10.673]  I'm a big fan of you and your product.
[02:56:10.673 --> 02:56:11.993]  Thank you.
[02:56:11.993 --> 02:56:16.095]  I want to talk about the marches that happened this past weekend.
[02:56:16.095 --> 02:56:16.595]  Yes.
[02:56:16.595 --> 02:56:20.577]  I feel like they were used to get uninformed people.
[02:56:20.577 --> 02:56:27.780]  They discovered it as a women's march to get uninformed people, so they could have more votes in favor of the Democrats.
[02:56:27.780 --> 02:56:30.181]  So it's to say, we're for the women?
[02:56:30.181 --> 02:56:31.282]  Yes.
[02:56:31.282 --> 02:56:32.042]  We want you alone.
[02:56:32.042 --> 02:56:33.003]  We don't want you to have kids.
[02:56:33.003 --> 02:56:33.823]  We want you on welfare.
[02:56:33.823 --> 02:56:35.004]  We want you sterilized.
[02:56:35.004 --> 02:56:35.624]  We really love you.
[02:56:36.707 --> 02:56:39.849]  Yeah, and I have another point to make.
[02:56:39.849 --> 02:56:48.553]  You guys stayed close to home when you guys were talking about identity politics, because this is my first election that I voted for, and I voted for Trump.
[02:56:48.553 --> 02:56:57.677]  And all hell was raised when I told my parents, because my father, he's Hispanic, and he's all like, why'd you do that?
[02:56:57.677 --> 02:56:59.838]  You went against all the Mexicans.
[02:56:59.838 --> 02:57:01.299]  You're with the racists.
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:04.682]  And I was like, he's for America.
[02:57:04.682 --> 02:57:06.543]  He's for my birthplace.
[02:57:06.543 --> 02:57:08.624]  I was born in America.
[02:57:08.624 --> 02:57:09.565]  I wasn't born... Hold on.
[02:57:09.565 --> 02:57:10.546]  I want to put you on hold.
[02:57:10.546 --> 02:57:11.646]  Don't hang up, George.
[02:57:11.646 --> 02:57:12.527]  We should have gone to you earlier.
[02:57:12.527 --> 02:57:13.708]  We're going to do five more minutes.
[02:57:13.708 --> 02:57:14.648]  We'll finish up with Joel Gilbert.
[02:57:14.648 --> 02:57:15.709]  I don't want to talk about this.
[02:57:15.709 --> 02:57:16.410]  My grandfather...
[02:57:17.410 --> 02:57:21.271]  My dad's dad was the first person, and of course my mother's dad as well.
[02:57:21.271 --> 02:57:22.932]  They both voted Republican.
[02:57:22.932 --> 02:57:26.173]  There were World War II vets that came back to help put Eisenhower in office.
[02:57:26.173 --> 02:57:28.994]  And one of them ran for office as a Republican and one in Texas.
[02:57:28.994 --> 02:57:30.274]  But the point was, can you imagine?
[02:57:30.274 --> 02:57:33.415]  My family wasn't like racist and all that, but you were Democrats here.
[02:57:33.415 --> 02:57:36.516]  Because, you know, the Republicans had invaded the South.
[02:57:36.516 --> 02:57:37.197]  And you know what?
[02:57:37.197 --> 02:57:41.418]  He was loved a decade after he did it, but he went through hell to do the right thing, just like you just did.
[02:57:43.991 --> 02:58:03.963]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:58:03.963 --> 02:58:06.085]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:58:06.085 --> 02:58:10.087]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[02:58:10.087 --> 02:58:11.108]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[02:58:11.528 --> 02:58:17.332]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:58:17.332 --> 02:58:19.714]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:58:19.714 --> 02:58:22.355]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:58:22.355 --> 02:58:25.157]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:58:25.157 --> 02:58:27.639]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:27.639 --> 02:58:36.845]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:58:36.845 --> 02:58:41.288]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:58:41.451 --> 02:58:41.664]  We're good.
[02:58:46.844 --> 02:59:05.254]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:59:05.254 --> 02:59:11.537]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:59:11.537 --> 02:59:12.897]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:59:12.897 --> 02:59:15.479]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[02:59:16.139 --> 02:59:17.661]  And so much more.
[02:59:17.661 --> 02:59:19.022]  It is concentrated.
[02:59:19.022 --> 02:59:20.763]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:59:20.763 --> 02:59:26.568]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:59:26.568 --> 02:59:27.789]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:59:27.789 --> 02:59:29.791]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:59:29.791 --> 02:59:32.393]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:59:32.393 --> 02:59:33.835]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:59:33.835 --> 02:59:36.197]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:59:36.197 --> 02:59:36.897]  Immune Wall.
[02:59:36.897 --> 02:59:38.339]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:38.339 --> 02:59:39.520]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:48.045 --> 03:00:05.929]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:05.929 --> 03:00:10.670]  Jack Posobiec's coming up!
[03:00:10.670 --> 03:00:14.571]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:16.192 --> 03:00:25.814]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.814 --> 03:00:33.196]  Jack Posobiec was there at the Women's March, there at their Night for Freedom, at the Antifa attack, trying to block folks coming in.
[03:00:33.196 --> 03:00:36.076]  These are people that want to shut our speech down, just like they do on the internet.
[03:00:36.076 --> 03:00:39.797]  I'll coast a little bit into the next hour with him.
[03:00:39.797 --> 03:00:42.397]  But George is telling a powerful story.
[03:00:42.397 --> 03:00:43.218]  See, here's the thing.
[03:00:43.218 --> 03:00:44.478]  I don't pander to people.
[03:00:45.990 --> 03:00:57.559]  I don't sit there, and I got family that does this, where we'll be in another part of the country, or around somebody that has a different accent, and so my family will start trying to adopt it.
[03:00:57.559 --> 03:01:00.362]  It drives me crazy.
[03:01:00.362 --> 03:01:03.784]  It's a form of virtue signaling, and they just do it to be nice.
[03:01:03.784 --> 03:01:05.846]  I'm going to talk like I'm going to talk.
[03:01:05.846 --> 03:01:07.367]  You like my culture.
[03:01:07.367 --> 03:01:09.509]  The truth is everybody likes different cultures.
[03:01:09.509 --> 03:01:10.730]  I like women that look different.
[03:01:10.730 --> 03:01:11.671]  I like food that's different.
[03:01:12.850 --> 03:01:15.792]  I want to go in the soul food restaurant and eat the black southern food.
[03:01:15.792 --> 03:01:16.953]  It's really just southern food.
[03:01:16.953 --> 03:01:20.136]  I want to go in the real Mexican food restaurant.
[03:01:20.136 --> 03:01:23.198]  Everybody likes everybody as long as there's plenty of resources.
[03:01:23.198 --> 03:01:24.419]  That's how humans act.
[03:01:24.419 --> 03:01:25.340]  We got free market.
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:27.282]  We got thousands of worlds.
[03:01:27.282 --> 03:01:29.323]  It's unlimited.
[03:01:29.323 --> 03:01:31.185]  What we don't need is domestication.
[03:01:31.185 --> 03:01:31.926]  Hispanics
[03:01:32.978 --> 03:01:39.119]  Which means from the island Hispaniola, that's funny enough what Haiti is today, it's not really Hispanic.
[03:01:39.119 --> 03:01:46.260]  That's the island Hispaniola, it's a Dominican Republican to the east and to the west, Haiti.
[03:01:46.260 --> 03:01:52.561]  I guess one part of the island is Hispanic, it's successful, the other is just voodoo infested in a hellhole.
[03:01:52.561 --> 03:01:57.062]  But the point is, is I didn't put the poor people down, we're trying to fix it.
[03:01:57.062 --> 03:02:00.603]  Hispanics are already half the population in the US below the age of 20.
[03:02:01.314 --> 03:02:04.095]  In another 10 years, it's a joke, it's your country.
[03:02:04.095 --> 03:02:15.962]  If you want it flooded by outside other third world populations who are going to be brainwashing the anti-free market and want to blow up the big free market rocket ship you got because you had kids, great!
[03:02:15.962 --> 03:02:20.684]  Stay Christian, have kids, don't let them abort your kids and don't let them sell you the New World Order.
[03:02:20.684 --> 03:02:21.565]  That's the message.
[03:02:21.565 --> 03:02:22.325]  You like free market?
[03:02:22.325 --> 03:02:23.385]  You like all this?
[03:02:23.385 --> 03:02:26.047]  People are trying to get in here because they want what's left of it.
[03:02:26.047 --> 03:02:27.988]  It's unlimited if we don't blow it up.
[03:02:29.304 --> 03:02:31.025]  I know what you're talking about.
[03:02:31.025 --> 03:02:33.027]  Leftists attack me for being a Trump supporter.
[03:02:33.027 --> 03:02:38.231]  I couldn't imagine what it's like in New York being, as you said, a Mexican-American who just wants to be an American.
[03:02:38.231 --> 03:02:42.115]  I don't say I'm a Welsh-American, just an American, and to have your family come after you.
[03:02:42.115 --> 03:02:43.676]  So finish up your story there, George.
[03:02:43.676 --> 03:02:44.697]  The point is, tell your family.
[03:02:45.540 --> 03:02:47.642]  Yeah, I'm just going to correct.
[03:02:47.642 --> 03:02:48.102]  I'm from California.
[03:03:06.792 --> 03:03:14.536]  Just to give you some of my background, I'm Mexican Salvadorian, but I claim to be American, because I was born in Denver, do you know California?
[03:03:14.536 --> 03:03:16.878]  Sure, yeah, you're an American.
[03:03:16.878 --> 03:03:23.542]  And even my mom gave me trouble last week with the whole asshole comment.
[03:03:23.542 --> 03:03:29.465]  She was saying, like, how can you go for someone that said that about people from my country?
[03:03:29.465 --> 03:03:31.046]  And I rebuttaled with
[03:03:31.573 --> 03:03:35.615]  Well, do you want to go live in El Salvador or do you want to stay here?
[03:03:35.615 --> 03:03:38.737]  And she said, I would rather stay here.
[03:03:38.737 --> 03:03:42.099]  Who doesn't call Haiti?
[03:03:42.099 --> 03:03:44.960]  Or other, I mean, it is, that is, there is crap.
[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:46.841]  There's no sewage treatment.
[03:03:46.841 --> 03:03:47.642]  There's crap.
[03:03:47.642 --> 03:03:49.383]  That's why they're called that.
[03:03:49.383 --> 03:03:50.403]  Everybody calls it that.
[03:03:50.403 --> 03:03:53.405]  I mean, people in Mexico say, I don't want to go to that city.
[03:03:53.405 --> 03:03:54.365]  Don't go there.
[03:03:54.365 --> 03:03:55.846]  Other people say, hey, should I go to this town or that town?
[03:03:55.846 --> 03:03:57.107]  They go, oh, don't go here.
[03:03:57.107 --> 03:03:59.728]  It's a real asshole in Spanish.
[03:03:59.728 --> 03:04:00.729]  That's what you call it.
[03:04:02.210 --> 03:04:06.814]  Even in El Salvador it's like that because you know the gangs are ruling over there.
[03:04:06.814 --> 03:04:10.176]  The government is ruled by the gangs over there.
[03:04:10.176 --> 03:04:16.381]  And I have family who have been threatened by the MS-13 or whatever gang is reigning over there.
[03:04:17.811 --> 03:04:20.113]  I just don't see why people don't see that.
[03:04:39.457 --> 03:04:40.778]  My dad's dad particularly.
[03:04:40.778 --> 03:04:42.599]  He knew it was the right thing to do.
[03:04:42.599 --> 03:04:44.099]  Civil Rights Act, all of it.
[03:04:44.099 --> 03:04:46.380]  He did it, like all those other people did back then.
[03:04:46.380 --> 03:04:49.342]  Then they turn around and call those very people racist today because they're ignorant.
[03:04:52.287 --> 03:04:53.147]  I'm so excited.
[03:04:53.147 --> 03:05:04.093]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[03:05:04.093 --> 03:05:12.617]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:12.617 --> 03:05:15.178]  Quite frankly, I just went off
[03:05:15.498 --> 03:05:22.166]  When I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:24.278 --> 03:05:34.542]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:34.542 --> 03:05:43.866]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:43.866 --> 03:05:46.547]  It is amazing!
[03:05:46.547 --> 03:05:51.509]  Red Pilt, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:06:02.631 --> 03:06:03.872]  Jack Posobiec!
[03:06:03.872 --> 03:06:08.796]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:06:08.796 --> 03:06:10.978]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.978 --> 03:06:13.039]  Jack Posobiec is going to do a great job hosting this hour.
[03:06:13.039 --> 03:06:18.204]  He was right there in the middle of the Night for Freedom rally that got so much international attention that Chelsea Manning showed up too.
[03:06:18.204 --> 03:06:22.007]  They were super nice too, so he then made up a bunch of crap.
[03:06:22.007 --> 03:06:24.008]  Amazing.
[03:06:24.008 --> 03:06:24.809]  I'm not going to pretend.
[03:06:24.809 --> 03:06:25.970]  You're a man, Manning.
[03:06:25.970 --> 03:06:27.151]  You got those chromosomes.
[03:06:28.462 --> 03:06:30.523]  I don't care if you think you're a woman and like guys.
[03:06:30.523 --> 03:06:31.524]  Knock yourself out, bro.
[03:06:31.524 --> 03:06:36.287]  I'm not going to say you're a pink pony either if you say you're one.
[03:06:36.287 --> 03:06:39.889]  Just like you say we're Nazis and we're not, jackass.
[03:06:39.889 --> 03:06:44.611]  So, we're going to finish up with Joel Gilbert to hand the baton over with Posobiec.
[03:06:44.611 --> 03:06:45.512]  Just what a circus.
[03:06:45.512 --> 03:06:47.353]  We've got so many clubs we're going to play this hour as well.
[03:06:47.353 --> 03:06:50.095]  But briefly, since we talked about it, I've got to play it one more time.
[03:06:50.095 --> 03:06:55.498]  Here's the trailer for Trump, The Art of the Insult, Standing Up to Bullies is my subtitle for it.
[03:06:55.498 --> 03:06:57.139]  That's what I'm going to call it when I put the trailer up.
[03:06:58.021 --> 03:06:59.121]  Directed by Joel Gilbert.
[03:06:59.121 --> 03:07:00.422]  He's made four films I've seen.
[03:07:00.422 --> 03:07:01.482]  They're all amazing.
[03:07:01.482 --> 03:07:02.282]  We carry them all.
[03:07:02.282 --> 03:07:06.243]  Infowarstore.com, No Place Like Utopia, Famous My Real Father, you name it.
[03:07:06.243 --> 03:07:09.104]  But this, he also made a film exposing the jihadists.
[03:07:09.104 --> 03:07:09.964]  The name escapes me.
[03:07:09.964 --> 03:07:12.644]  What's the name of that film?
[03:07:12.644 --> 03:07:13.265]  There's two of them.
[03:07:13.265 --> 03:07:15.985]  One is Farewell Israel and one is Atomic Jihad.
[03:07:15.985 --> 03:07:16.525]  That's right.
[03:07:16.525 --> 03:07:18.306]  I've seen all those.
[03:07:18.306 --> 03:07:20.566]  And we, I think we used to carry them.
[03:07:20.566 --> 03:07:23.247]  Wasn't it the Farewell Israel they tried to arrest you for?
[03:07:23.247 --> 03:07:27.208]  What was the thing in Congress that they wanted you arrested for saying it was a campaign violation?
[03:07:28.066 --> 03:07:32.211]  Well, that was Drewson, my real father, and it was only defeated by three to three.
[03:07:32.211 --> 03:07:37.797]  Luckily, the three Republican commissioners on the FEC would not go along with crushing free speech.
[03:07:37.797 --> 03:07:43.244]  Otherwise, I would have been sent up to the Justice Department for prosecution.
[03:07:43.244 --> 03:07:44.345]  I'm a media outlet.
[03:07:44.345 --> 03:07:45.707]  I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[03:07:46.542 --> 03:07:51.125]  So it's well established I have a media exemption, just like CNN, just like InfoWars.
[03:07:51.125 --> 03:07:56.908]  I mean, the same chairlady, when she was previously, she wanted me arrested, too, and drudged.
[03:07:56.908 --> 03:08:03.992]  She said, we were the three she singled out, and she said that we were all involved in illegal campaign operations.
[03:08:03.992 --> 03:08:11.796]  That was their allegation, and luckily, mine died 3-3, but it was very serious just because it ended 3-3.
[03:08:13.411 --> 03:08:18.538]  It's still through a, uh, cast a chill across, uh, conservative filmmakers.
[03:08:18.538 --> 03:08:19.759]  Oh yeah, mine too, mine too.
[03:08:19.759 --> 03:08:20.580]  Exactly.
[03:08:20.580 --> 03:08:23.945]  If Hillary would have got in, she'd have got another chairperson, they'd have had four.
[03:08:23.945 --> 03:08:24.966]  They would have us.
[03:08:24.966 --> 03:08:27.489]  I mean, they would put us in jail like Dinesh D'Souza.
[03:08:27.489 --> 03:08:29.912]  They would add one more commissioner to break the ties.
[03:08:30.653 --> 03:08:32.775]  And I can't believe we're just calmly talking about this.
[03:08:32.775 --> 03:08:34.056]  This is the left that
[03:08:52.728 --> 03:09:02.517]  You know, if you try to stop their bomb-making, they say you're censoring them, but they're on the streets attacking us, they're blocking us online, Europe's announcing anything conservative or libertarian or nationalist will be banned.
[03:09:02.517 --> 03:09:06.220]  They're working with the big tech companies to do it, the big social networks.
[03:09:06.220 --> 03:09:08.001]  I mean, what about Europe, though?
[03:09:08.001 --> 03:09:08.842]  Is Europe lost?
[03:09:08.842 --> 03:09:14.727]  We see a big nationalist awakening, but their response there is just to go full whole hog with U.S.
[03:09:14.727 --> 03:09:16.609]  companies working with them to censor.
[03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:23.655]  The Justice Department, our own government, and the trust busters break them up for engaging in authoritarian activities?
[03:09:23.655 --> 03:09:27.658]  I mean, even though it's overseas, that's still criminal!
[03:09:27.658 --> 03:09:32.783]  Look, they should have broken, they should break them up just like they did in the late 60s.
[03:09:32.783 --> 03:09:41.991]  FBI, Operation Paperclip, all kind of operations to break up the radical left that were allying themselves with the Cuban intelligence.
[03:09:41.991 --> 03:09:43.172]  They were taking money from
[03:09:43.852 --> 03:09:45.814]  Yeah, this is who we're dealing with.
[03:09:45.814 --> 03:09:49.057]  So, look, there's a book out by Douglas Murray called The Strange Death of Europe.
[03:10:05.359 --> 03:10:11.443]  And it talks about how only the Western leftist mentality says, we need more diversity.
[03:10:11.443 --> 03:10:13.705]  We need more Somalians.
[03:10:13.705 --> 03:10:15.866]  We need more people from India.
[03:10:15.866 --> 03:10:18.808]  We need more people from all these third world countries.
[03:10:18.808 --> 03:10:22.691]  But you don't see people in India saying, you know, we need some more Texans.
[03:10:22.691 --> 03:10:23.912]  We're just not going to be happy.
[03:10:24.532 --> 03:10:27.595]  Unless we get some Texans here in Bombay.
[03:10:27.595 --> 03:10:29.096]  But I'll say this about the Indians.
[03:10:29.096 --> 03:10:31.858]  On average, they're the highest grossing group in the country.
[03:10:31.858 --> 03:10:32.639]  They're all friendly.
[03:10:32.639 --> 03:10:36.882]  Most of the Indians I know, like every Indian I know, as far as quite a few Indian Americans, they love Trump.
[03:10:37.725 --> 03:10:43.607]  Well, you've got very successful groups of people that come from other countries.
[03:10:43.607 --> 03:10:48.649]  The argument that Trump is making, which is the same as they do in Canada and Australia, is a merit-based system.
[03:10:48.649 --> 03:10:54.431]  Let's have people apply and we'll vet people so we get people that can support themselves and create business.
[03:10:54.431 --> 03:11:01.233]  Why do you think Indians, compared to all, because that's the only group that demographically votes Republican, why do you think Indian Americans like Trump so much?
[03:11:02.088 --> 03:11:04.870]  Oh, the Indian Americans understand free enterprise.
[03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:07.772]  They understand how hard it is in a socialist system.
[03:11:07.772 --> 03:11:16.399]  They come from India that had many, many years of socialism and poverty, and they just see the opportunity that when the government gets out of the way, that they can prosper.
[03:11:16.399 --> 03:11:24.866]  So you have a very, very strong and successful and vibrant community of Indian Americans that start businesses.
[03:11:24.866 --> 03:11:26.567]  I have a couple of friends here in L.A.
[03:11:26.567 --> 03:11:28.829]  that are just fantastic entrepreneurs.
[03:11:28.829 --> 03:11:30.210]  It's just amazing what they accomplish.
[03:11:30.370 --> 03:11:34.378]  I was about to say, Indians are the per capita richest group.
[03:11:34.378 --> 03:11:36.742]  The top nine are Asian groups.
[03:11:36.742 --> 03:11:40.669]  Oh, but now the left even says, don't let them go with degrees.
[03:11:40.669 --> 03:11:42.793]  Have affirmative action against Asians now.
[03:11:44.557 --> 03:11:48.440]  Well, it's endless the way the leftist narrative changes when it doesn't work out.
[03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:49.601]  Remember global warming?
[03:11:49.601 --> 03:11:51.002]  You don't hear that anymore.
[03:11:51.002 --> 03:11:52.384]  Now it's climate change.
[03:11:52.384 --> 03:12:00.550]  So if there's a hurricane, or if the sun comes up, it's climate change, and we gotta give more money to leftist causes.
[03:12:00.550 --> 03:12:04.233]  The narrative of the left is so bankrupt, I really believe that
[03:12:05.294 --> 03:12:16.196]  Americans are finding out and understanding really through the impetus of Donald Trump and him standing up to these narratives that you don't just have to accept and believe what you're what you're being fed.
[03:12:16.196 --> 03:12:18.877]  All right, Joel Gilbert, thank you so much, my friend.
[03:12:18.877 --> 03:12:19.817]  Come back very soon.
[03:12:19.817 --> 03:12:21.277]  Every time he's on it, we gotta get this guy on more.
[03:12:21.277 --> 03:12:22.077]  He's so smart.
[03:12:22.077 --> 03:12:22.718]  Thank you, Joel Gilbert.
[03:12:22.718 --> 03:12:26.678]  The new film, Trump, The Art of the Insult, will be right back with Jack Posobiec.
[03:12:26.678 --> 03:12:29.459]  Here is the trailer for the film, available at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:12:31.089 --> 03:12:36.230]  You call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:37.751]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:12:37.751 --> 03:12:41.072]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[03:12:41.072 --> 03:12:45.233]  Who cares?
[03:12:45.233 --> 03:12:48.133]  You haven't been called.
[03:12:48.133 --> 03:12:50.374]  Go back to Univision.
[03:12:50.374 --> 03:12:51.874]  I think Jeff is a nice person.
[03:12:51.874 --> 03:12:52.895]  He's very low energy.
[03:12:52.895 --> 03:12:54.455]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[03:12:57.628 --> 03:12:58.348]  Throw him out.
[03:12:58.348 --> 03:12:59.788]  Throw him out into the cold.
[03:12:59.788 --> 03:13:05.670]  Don't give him their coat.
[03:13:05.670 --> 03:13:07.830]  No coats.
[03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:19.232]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[03:13:19.232 --> 03:13:20.713]  The most dishonest human beings.
[03:13:20.713 --> 03:13:21.533]  These people right here.
[03:13:21.533 --> 03:13:22.073]  Look at all the cameras.
[03:13:23.514 --> 03:13:27.217]  He's so disgusting.
[03:13:27.217 --> 03:13:29.299]  This socialist slash communist.
[03:13:29.299 --> 03:13:29.799]  Crazy Bernie.
[03:13:29.799 --> 03:13:31.641]  He's crazy as it may look.
[03:13:31.641 --> 03:13:34.783]  Pocahontas.
[03:13:34.783 --> 03:13:35.624]  The Indian.
[03:13:35.624 --> 03:13:36.625]  Very offensive.
[03:13:36.625 --> 03:13:37.906]  I'm sorry about that.
[03:13:37.906 --> 03:13:38.586]  Pocahontas.
[03:13:38.586 --> 03:13:41.689]  Crooked Hillary.
[03:13:41.689 --> 03:13:42.890]  Crooked Hillary, folks.
[03:13:42.890 --> 03:13:45.012]  She's been crooked from the beginning.
[03:13:45.012 --> 03:13:50.296]  Crooked Hillary.
[03:13:50.296 --> 03:13:52.237]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[03:13:52.237 --> 03:13:52.518]  Yeah.
[03:13:54.477 --> 03:13:58.120]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[03:13:58.120 --> 03:13:59.942]  This had nothing to do with me.
[03:13:59.942 --> 03:14:03.444]  Except I might have pointed it out.
[03:14:03.444 --> 03:14:05.746]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[03:14:05.746 --> 03:14:07.588]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[03:14:07.588 --> 03:14:09.610]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[03:14:09.610 --> 03:14:11.291]  Because they were protecting him.
[03:14:11.291 --> 03:14:12.232]  I'm trying to be nice.
[03:14:12.232 --> 03:14:15.034]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[03:14:15.034 --> 03:14:16.856]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[03:14:16.856 --> 03:14:18.697]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[03:14:18.697 --> 03:14:19.778]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[03:14:21.601 --> 03:14:24.462]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[03:14:24.462 --> 03:14:25.062]  It just doesn't work!
[03:14:25.062 --> 03:14:28.142]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[03:14:28.142 --> 03:14:30.063]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[03:14:30.063 --> 03:14:34.023]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[03:14:34.023 --> 03:14:36.104]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[03:14:36.104 --> 03:14:39.664]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[03:14:39.664 --> 03:14:40.625]  Repeat after me.
[03:14:40.625 --> 03:14:44.145]  Donald, uh, you're not gonna be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[03:14:44.145 --> 03:14:45.405]  That's not gonna happen.
[03:14:45.405 --> 03:14:46.546]  So help me God.
[03:14:46.546 --> 03:14:47.926]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[03:14:53.960 --> 03:14:58.222]  We will make America great again!
[03:14:58.222 --> 03:14:59.182]  Go home to Mommy!
[03:15:15.663 --> 03:15:17.744]  We are going to talk about all about that event.
[03:15:17.744 --> 03:15:23.267]  We're going to talk about the amazing event that was held inside as well as the Antifa attack that happened outside.
[03:15:23.267 --> 03:15:24.948]  Someone got put in the hospital.
[03:15:24.948 --> 03:15:29.010]  But we had Chelsea Manning inside who was welcomed and treated fairly and politely.
[03:15:29.010 --> 03:15:30.310]  So you can see the contrast.
[03:15:30.310 --> 03:15:31.171]  You can see the difference.
[03:15:31.954 --> 03:15:32.534]  Absolutely.
[03:15:32.534 --> 03:15:37.696]  Jack Posobiec, great patriot, and leads one of the biggest Trump groups in the election.
[03:15:37.696 --> 03:15:43.559]  Also, got outed as a member of the Naval Intelligence, even though he wasn't involved in the campaign in that half.
[03:15:43.559 --> 03:15:46.140]  By the left, they say the President likes him and tweets him.
[03:15:46.140 --> 03:15:47.921]  He can't be a Naval Intelligence.
[03:15:47.921 --> 03:15:50.462]  The President can't like you and have you be an officer in the Navy.

[03:19:10.141 --> 03:19:22.815]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[03:19:22.815 --> 03:19:26.659]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[03:19:27.119 --> 03:19:31.602]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.

[03:20:17.134 --> 03:20:22.258]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:20:29.951 --> 03:20:39.197]  Folks, it's Jack Posobiec sitting in today, the big fourth hour here on InfoWars, and wow, what a weekend, what an absolutely amazing weekend we had.
[03:20:39.197 --> 03:20:47.002]  A weekend for liberty, a weekend for patriotism, a weekend where the lovers and defenders of this country were able to meet together
[03:20:47.242 --> 03:20:51.404]  We're able to rise up and face those forces that stand against us.
[03:20:51.404 --> 03:21:08.610]  It happened all throughout New York City, and let me tell you, those dark forces, the Antifa, the Women's March, they were out in full force to try and stop us, but they were unable to because we uninhibited and celebratory held an amazing, super wonderful event.
[03:21:08.610 --> 03:21:12.311]  Thousand people were there, lots of news, so much I want to break down.
[03:21:13.112 --> 03:21:15.693]  The women's event, you guys saw them all out in New York City.
[03:21:15.693 --> 03:21:18.554]  They said, why would you have an event the same weekend as the Women's March?
[03:21:18.554 --> 03:21:30.619]  And I said, because it's the time to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our president being inaugurated, the one-year anniversary of the day that everything began to change in America.
[03:21:30.619 --> 03:21:38.882]  The people came back into power to take back our White House and to take back the reins of government in the United States.
[03:21:38.882 --> 03:21:40.042]  That's why we held that night.
[03:21:40.042 --> 03:21:41.203]  And let me tell you something, folks.
[03:21:41.203 --> 03:21:42.123]  You know, in my speech,
[03:21:43.095 --> 03:21:43.655]  That I delivered.
[03:21:43.655 --> 03:21:47.297]  Actually, what I did was I read Ragged Old Flag by Johnny Cash.
[03:21:47.297 --> 03:21:50.178]  If you guys know that one, it's an ode to our American flag.
[03:21:50.178 --> 03:21:53.300]  I don't even think I said the word Trump once in the entire night.
[03:21:53.300 --> 03:21:57.842]  And the reason for that is because this movement isn't about one man.
[03:21:57.842 --> 03:21:59.923]  It's not about one individual.
[03:21:59.923 --> 03:22:00.463]  All right.
[03:22:22.421 --> 03:22:34.185]  Of me, I went out and confronted Antifa, and thankfully the New York Police Department, they actually set up barricades, and then there was a chain-link fence where they couldn't get through to me, but you see them there on the film.
[03:22:34.185 --> 03:22:37.246]  They see me, they start screaming about our children.
[03:22:37.246 --> 03:22:38.606]  They say, send out your children.
[03:22:38.606 --> 03:22:39.767]  They want to see your kids.
[03:22:39.767 --> 03:22:42.748]  They start banging on the fence with their 2x4s.
[03:22:42.748 --> 03:22:47.129]  You see, when we always show up to, you know, protests or rallies, sure, we'll bring a sign.
[03:22:48.169 --> 03:22:48.510]  I don't
[03:23:09.111 --> 03:23:09.551]  We're good.
[03:23:28.881 --> 03:23:31.542]  Uh, saying they wanted to attack our very children.
[03:23:31.542 --> 03:23:32.722]  They wanted to go after our children.
[03:23:32.722 --> 03:23:39.824]  In fact, James O'Keefe, uh, who was attending the event, he, at the point where he left, they actually chased O'Keefe down the street.
[03:23:39.824 --> 03:23:49.487]  So, when he got there, I went down, I met him, I brought him upstairs, I said, O'Keefe, glad you're here, glad you were able to come, uh, let's, let's get up, let's get through security, walked him through.
[03:23:49.487 --> 03:23:55.169]  He had to leave, he had to bounce somewhere, but when he left, Antifa started chasing him down the street.
[03:23:55.169 --> 03:23:57.730]  Now, fortunately, he had a car waiting, he was able to get in, he was safe.
[03:23:58.524 --> 03:24:07.426]  But later on in the event, or after the event, I should say, one of our supporters, one of our guests, a 56-year-old man was leaving the event.
[03:24:07.426 --> 03:24:14.067]  Antifa chased him down the street, assaulted and strangled this man.
[03:24:14.067 --> 03:24:25.630]  And so this Antifa, 30-year-old guy, was charged with strangulation, blocking of the airway, actually blocking of the airway, just for attending an event, a pro-Trump event.
[03:24:25.630 --> 03:24:27.670]  There was a terrorist attack, because remember,
[03:24:28.576 --> 03:24:35.780]  By the words of the classification of FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, Antifa has been classified as a terrorist organization.
[03:24:35.780 --> 03:24:40.223]  They loitered outside, waiting to catch someone by themselves.
[03:24:40.223 --> 03:24:45.006]  This guy was walking, I think he was going to catch a cab or an Uber, and they assaulted him.
[03:24:45.006 --> 03:24:46.107]  He was strangled.
[03:24:46.107 --> 03:24:47.948]  Now, we've talked to the victim.
[03:24:48.368 --> 03:24:49.730]  The victim is secure.
[03:24:49.730 --> 03:24:50.991]  He's actually went to the hospital.
[03:24:50.991 --> 03:24:52.193]  He was declared stable.
[03:24:52.193 --> 03:24:54.836]  He's actually currently recuperating and resting at home.
[03:24:54.836 --> 03:24:57.059]  And we're going to do everything we can to make sure that he's safe.
[03:24:57.059 --> 03:24:59.482]  If he needs anything, we're going to take care of it.
[03:24:59.482 --> 03:25:04.388]  On the other hand, the terrorist who did this to him, he's going to jail.
[03:25:04.975 --> 03:25:10.899]  Prosecutors are already looking at it, and there's going to be big jail time associated with this attack.
[03:25:10.899 --> 03:25:16.503]  And hopefully, we'll be able to use some of it to actually prosecute the Antifa groups.
[03:25:16.503 --> 03:25:30.653]  Not only the man who conducted this attack, the child, the man-child, this 30-year-old, you know, pasty white boy, but the actual group that instigated the entire thing, and the fact that different online
[03:25:31.425 --> 03:25:36.806]  Supporters or enemies, you should say enemies of ours, encouraged this attack to take place.
[03:25:36.806 --> 03:25:43.688]  We found what happened was the location, which we kept secret, was doxxed, was sent out online.
[03:25:43.688 --> 03:25:47.949]  There was a reporter there and it said, and they even attacked the reporter who was there.
[03:25:47.949 --> 03:25:50.750]  It wasn't even someone who was there, he was just there reporting the event.
[03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:56.191]  He was recording, he was trying to tape, and they went and attacked the recorder, the guy who was just trying to tape it, the reporter.
[03:25:56.191 --> 03:25:58.472]  So anyone who was
[03:25:59.451 --> 03:26:08.899]  Complicit in the instigation and the execution of this attack is going to be prosecuted.
[03:26:08.899 --> 03:26:10.221]  We're going to look at all of it.
[03:26:10.221 --> 03:26:13.684]  And New York prosecutors can see this as a slam dunk case.
[03:26:13.684 --> 03:26:19.349]  Because what it is, is quite simply, quite simply, so there he is, David Campbell, Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
[03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:22.411]  Crown Heights, by the way, is not one of the poorer areas of Brooklyn.
[03:26:23.552 --> 03:26:25.312]  A very well-to-do area.
[03:26:25.312 --> 03:26:30.233]  So this guy, I don't know if his rich parents are paying his way, but you always see that with these Antifa types, right?
[03:26:30.233 --> 03:26:34.254]  And then they come and they see us, and he doesn't even know who this person is who he has assaulted.
[03:26:34.254 --> 03:26:35.694]  He wasn't one of the speakers.
[03:26:35.694 --> 03:26:39.115]  He wasn't someone who was there espousing support for Trump or anything.
[03:26:39.115 --> 03:26:40.275]  He just went to an event.
[03:26:40.275 --> 03:26:49.817]  He literally just went to an event, and yet that was enough for these Antifa terrorists to go and attack him, to go and assault him, to literally put him in the hospital.
[03:26:49.817 --> 03:26:52.397]  Put into the hospital in New York City.
[03:26:53.132 --> 03:27:00.135]  United States of America, American soil, for attending an event for freedom.
[03:27:00.135 --> 03:27:02.616]  That's where we are at this point.
[03:27:02.616 --> 03:27:08.279]  That's where we are that someone gets put into the hospital because you went to a night to support freedom.
[03:27:08.279 --> 03:27:09.259]  Well, no more.
[03:27:09.259 --> 03:27:16.262]  Because it's against the law and the groups that are perpetuating this type of terrorism, this type of violence, need to be stopped.
[03:27:16.262 --> 03:27:20.484]  They need to be investigated, they need to be prosecuted, and they need to be put behind bars.
[03:27:21.244 --> 03:27:31.613]  We've always stood for peace, and I thank God, I thank God that the NYPD were there, because if they hadn't stopped him, the choking, the strangulation, who knows what would have happened after this.
[03:27:31.613 --> 03:27:31.773]  So...
[03:27:32.717 --> 03:27:34.638]  I was actually inside when this happened.
[03:27:34.638 --> 03:27:38.801]  It says that at one point he actually even tried to put a police officer in a headlock.
[03:27:38.801 --> 03:27:40.102]  Let me tell you something.
[03:27:40.102 --> 03:27:44.785]  When you try to put the NYPD in a headlock, you're going to lose that fight.
[03:27:44.785 --> 03:27:45.826]  Let me tell you right now.
[03:27:45.826 --> 03:27:46.926]  Sorry, Antifa.
[03:27:46.926 --> 03:27:48.367]  You're going to lose that fight.
[03:27:48.367 --> 03:27:51.189]  And this guy, David Campbell, he lost that one.
[03:27:51.189 --> 03:27:54.531]  You don't go up against the NYPD and try to put him in a headlock.
[03:27:54.531 --> 03:27:55.272]  Not a good idea.
[03:27:56.289 --> 03:27:59.392]  But I want to take a second really quick.
[03:27:59.392 --> 03:28:07.319]  Here we are at the end of the segment to let you guys know about a great new product that's just out from InfoWars Life and it's called Pollen Block.
[03:28:07.319 --> 03:28:08.740]  It's this incredible product.

[03:28:17.327 --> 03:28:20.769]  Folks, we hate it when pollen season starts.
[03:28:20.769 --> 03:28:22.550]  It's constantly attacking our sinuses.
[03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:24.111]  We feel like we have no choice.
[03:28:24.111 --> 03:28:26.353]  Do you want to stay indoors the entire time?
[03:28:26.353 --> 03:28:26.793]  No.
[03:28:26.793 --> 03:28:29.194]  You go out, you can use the pollen block.
[03:28:29.194 --> 03:28:31.936]  It will support you with that seasonal discomfort.
[03:28:31.936 --> 03:28:35.278]  It's going to help support healthy sinus function, respiratory function.

[03:28:41.543 --> 03:28:44.566]  The quail egg concentrate is where it comes from.

[03:30:18.365 --> 03:30:19.226]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:30:19.226 --> 03:30:19.746]  Well, thank you.
[03:30:19.746 --> 03:30:24.671]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread on Me, but instead it says Won't Tread on Me.
[03:30:24.671 --> 03:30:27.614]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[03:30:27.614 --> 03:30:30.897]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[03:30:30.897 --> 03:30:37.142]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.

[03:31:50.718 --> 03:31:55.020]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:31:55.020 --> 03:31:55.661]  Go ahead.
[03:31:55.661 --> 03:31:57.962]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[03:31:57.962 --> 03:32:00.863]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:32:01.716 --> 03:32:03.138]  It just gets old, man.
[03:32:03.138 --> 03:32:05.560]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:32:05.560 --> 03:32:07.883]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:32:07.883 --> 03:32:11.907]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:32:11.907 --> 03:32:15.211]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:32:15.211 --> 03:32:17.894]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:32:17.894 --> 03:32:19.255]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:32:19.255 --> 03:32:20.377]  Us being shut down?
[03:32:20.377 --> 03:32:21.398]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:32:21.838 --> 03:32:22.919]  You know what, Alex?
[03:32:22.919 --> 03:32:24.000]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[03:32:24.000 --> 03:32:25.100]  Hey, Frank!
[03:32:25.100 --> 03:32:30.764]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:32:30.764 --> 03:32:35.287]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:32:35.287 --> 03:32:38.169]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:32:38.169 --> 03:32:38.890]  Do you understand?
[03:32:38.890 --> 03:32:40.531]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:32:40.531 --> 03:32:41.652]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:32:42.652 --> 03:32:48.018]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:32:48.018 --> 03:32:48.959]  Do you understand?
[03:32:48.959 --> 03:32:50.240]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:32:50.240 --> 03:32:56.326]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[03:32:56.326 --> 03:33:04.234]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:04.234 --> 03:33:05.915]  You gotta keep them separated.
[03:33:18.981 --> 03:33:25.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:31.519 --> 03:33:32.239]  What's going on, folks?
[03:33:32.239 --> 03:33:33.120]  Jack Masovic here.
[03:33:33.120 --> 03:33:37.283]  Big fourth hour, breaking down all the news that happened over the weekend.
[03:33:37.283 --> 03:33:38.203]  Huge weekend.
[03:33:38.203 --> 03:33:39.124]  New York City.
[03:33:39.124 --> 03:33:42.526]  Everything was going down at a night for freedom.
[03:33:42.526 --> 03:33:44.207]  Over a thousand patriots there.
[03:33:44.207 --> 03:33:46.068]  We had such an incredible night.
[03:33:46.068 --> 03:33:47.169]  We had live music.
[03:33:47.169 --> 03:33:48.089]  We had DJs.
[03:33:48.089 --> 03:33:49.270]  We had dancing.
[03:33:49.270 --> 03:33:51.932]  We had Stephen Molyneux gave an amazing speech.
[03:33:51.932 --> 03:33:53.173]  Gavin McInnes was there.
[03:33:53.173 --> 03:33:53.633]  I got up.
[03:33:53.633 --> 03:33:56.815]  Mike Cernovich, of course, running the entire show.
[03:33:56.815 --> 03:33:58.176]  But there was one guest
[03:33:59.076 --> 03:34:11.823]  One special guest, not a speaker, not someone who was featured, but one guest, just an attendee really of the event, who caused a lot of controversy all of a sudden all over the left-wing media sphere.
[03:34:11.823 --> 03:34:14.565]  The left-wing was having conniption fits over this one.
[03:34:14.565 --> 03:34:16.646]  We didn't really understand why.
[03:34:16.646 --> 03:34:27.252]  We didn't understand what was going on or what was wrong with it because all of a sudden at our event, people started turning around and saying, hey Jack, is that Chelsea Manning over there?
[03:34:28.257 --> 03:34:33.325]  And I looked and sure enough, there was Chelsea Manning at the event and I said, wow, look at that.
[03:34:33.325 --> 03:34:40.636]  So we looked into it and what basically happened was, yeah, so Chelsea Manning ended up coming to the event and we said, you know what?
[03:34:41.949 --> 03:34:43.249]  We're the tolerant side.
[03:34:43.249 --> 03:34:48.051]  We don't have a problem with someone coming and wanting to come to our event.
[03:34:48.051 --> 03:34:49.151]  And so, fine.
[03:34:49.151 --> 03:34:50.272]  Come on in.
[03:34:50.272 --> 03:34:52.352]  Have a nice time at the event.
[03:34:52.352 --> 03:34:53.653]  Enjoy the party.
[03:34:53.653 --> 03:34:55.153]  Maybe you can learn something, right?
[03:34:55.153 --> 03:34:59.394]  Maybe you can pick up something that you can take back and talk to your friends on the left about.
[03:34:59.394 --> 03:35:03.396]  Because again, we're always told to be tolerant, right?
[03:35:03.396 --> 03:35:10.078]  We're always told by the left that you guys need to be more tolerant, and you guys need to be more accepting, and you guys need to be more open.
[03:35:10.078 --> 03:35:11.058]  We said, fine.
[03:35:11.058 --> 03:35:11.538]  All right, sure.
[03:35:11.578 --> 03:35:12.558]  We're good to go.
[03:35:29.039 --> 03:35:36.644]  However, once news broke, the left went into conniption fits, saying, Chelsea Manning is some kind of Russian plant!
[03:35:36.644 --> 03:35:44.229]  Chelsea Manning is some racist neo-Nazi secret, you know, cryptocurrency, I don't even know what kind of thing.
[03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:49.013]  They were losing their minds that Chelsea would attend our event.
[03:35:49.013 --> 03:35:54.116]  So then Chelsea posted this thing up that I crashed the fascist white supremacist hate brigade party.
[03:35:54.116 --> 03:35:55.397]  Selfies were denied.
[03:35:55.397 --> 03:35:58.019]  Well, no, actually the selfies were denied because nobody
[03:35:58.857 --> 03:36:00.639]  Nobody wanted to bother you.
[03:36:00.639 --> 03:36:02.601]  Nobody wanted to mess with you.
[03:36:02.601 --> 03:36:03.582]  You didn't crash it.
[03:36:03.582 --> 03:36:05.524]  You actually just attended the event.
[03:36:05.524 --> 03:36:06.405]  You had a ticket.
[03:36:06.405 --> 03:36:07.666]  You were invited.
[03:36:07.666 --> 03:36:10.549]  And nobody had a problem with you being there whatsoever.
[03:36:10.549 --> 03:36:11.470]  So, you know what?
[03:36:11.470 --> 03:36:11.710]  Fine.
[03:36:11.710 --> 03:36:12.411]  You're going to call us.
[03:36:12.411 --> 03:36:13.612]  You're going to lie about us.
[03:36:13.612 --> 03:36:14.773]  You're going to say things like that.
[03:36:14.773 --> 03:36:18.837]  Stab us in the back after we invited you in and had a nice time with you.
[03:36:18.837 --> 03:36:19.778]  You know what?
[03:36:19.778 --> 03:36:20.459]  That's for you to do.
[03:36:20.459 --> 03:36:22.221]  But I would say, not very classy.
[03:36:22.521 --> 03:36:27.687]  Not a very classy thing to do when someone invites you in and treats you with respect.
[03:36:27.687 --> 03:36:29.730]  Because that's what we're taught about so much, right?
[03:36:29.730 --> 03:36:32.373]  We're told, respect people who disagree with you.
[03:36:32.373 --> 03:36:34.155]  We happen to be Trump supporters.
[03:36:34.155 --> 03:36:35.657]  We're not white supremacists.
[03:36:35.657 --> 03:36:36.578]  We're not neo-Nazis.
[03:36:36.578 --> 03:36:37.399]  We're not fascists.
[03:36:37.399 --> 03:36:40.142]  We're Trump supporters who love liberty and love our country, right?
[03:36:41.238 --> 03:36:43.380]  But apparently that's not good enough for sometimes.
[03:36:43.380 --> 03:36:46.963]  But I would say, I would say simply, contrast that.
[03:36:46.963 --> 03:36:49.285]  Contrast that with what happened before.
[03:36:49.285 --> 03:36:50.746]  Confront your enemies face to face.
[03:36:50.746 --> 03:36:52.607]  Okay, well, you confronted us.
[03:36:52.607 --> 03:36:54.369]  Anything specifically to say?
[03:36:54.369 --> 03:36:56.710]  Anything specifically that you disagreed with?
[03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:58.352]  Let's have that conversation.
[03:36:58.352 --> 03:36:59.853]  Let's not lie about each other.
[03:36:59.853 --> 03:37:01.114]  Let's not attack each other.
[03:37:01.114 --> 03:37:03.356]  Let's have that conversation.
[03:37:03.356 --> 03:37:05.918]  Because which side was the tolerant side now?
[03:37:06.458 --> 03:37:17.951]  So, inside, Chelsea Manning came in, a figure of the left as we all know, came in and everybody was polite, everybody was respectful, everybody was completely cool with it.
[03:37:17.951 --> 03:37:20.214]  They said, fine, you want to come and listen to our event?
[03:37:20.214 --> 03:37:20.814]  Listen!
[03:37:20.814 --> 03:37:25.059]  Maybe you get red-pilled, maybe here's something you like, maybe you can stand up for the American flag, right?
[03:37:25.874 --> 03:37:41.900]  However, when our people, when our attendees go outside and are met with people from Antifa, Antifa goes and assaults them in the streets and puts them in the hospital after choking them and trying to choke police officers.
[03:37:41.900 --> 03:37:47.202]  So again, tell me which side, you can see it right there for the one simple event, right?
[03:37:47.202 --> 03:37:49.123]  Look at, look at the, look, you know,
[03:37:50.009 --> 03:37:51.971]  Look at the optics of this.
[03:37:51.971 --> 03:38:01.759]  These people outside with the 2x4s, with the weapons, banging on the chain link fence, screaming that we want to kill your children, that we want your kids, right?
[03:38:01.759 --> 03:38:06.763]  Putting our people in the hospital, this is me getting that close to them, putting my own life in jeopardy.
[03:38:06.763 --> 03:38:09.786]  Chelsea Manning comes in, no problem whatsoever.
[03:38:09.786 --> 03:38:13.829]  Chelsea Manning comes in, doesn't get put in the hospital, doesn't get choked out, doesn't get punched.
[03:38:16.900 --> 03:38:21.922]  To have a drink, and sit down, and listen to people talk, and listen to some music.
[03:38:21.922 --> 03:38:24.183]  That's what happened to Chelsea Manning when she attended our event.
[03:38:24.183 --> 03:38:37.047]  So a room full of Trump supporters, full of veterans like myself, who certainly disagree with leaking classified information, and certainly disagree with stealing government documents to do so, is treated fairly.
[03:38:37.549 --> 03:38:39.410]  And that's what we're all told.
[03:38:39.410 --> 03:38:40.150]  Isn't that what we're all told?
[03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:41.391]  The golden rule, right?
[03:38:41.391 --> 03:38:42.931]  The golden rule.
[03:38:42.931 --> 03:38:46.073]  Treat people the way you wish to be treated.
[03:38:46.073 --> 03:38:48.774]  That's what I thought I was respecting.
[03:38:48.774 --> 03:38:50.575]  That's what we all thought we were respecting.
[03:38:50.575 --> 03:38:51.795]  Isn't that what the media tells us?
[03:38:51.795 --> 03:38:52.936]  But no.
[03:38:52.936 --> 03:38:53.656]  They, the left,
[03:38:54.372 --> 03:38:54.632]  Doesn't
[03:39:15.307 --> 03:39:18.468]  No, that's the culture that they want to foster.
[03:39:18.468 --> 03:39:20.549]  That's the culture of aggression.
[03:39:20.549 --> 03:39:28.492]  That's the culture of anger and screaming and at each other's throats and the violence in the streets of Antifa, which happened later in the evening.
[03:39:28.492 --> 03:39:30.853]  That's the culture that gets pushed down.
[03:39:30.853 --> 03:39:34.354]  The aggression, the violence, the madness, the derangement.
[03:39:34.354 --> 03:39:36.135]  We call it Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:39:36.135 --> 03:39:37.115]  So which side?
[03:39:37.115 --> 03:39:38.336]  And you look at some of these people.
[03:39:38.336 --> 03:39:40.256]  They're wearing the pink hats.
[03:39:40.256 --> 03:39:43.538]  There's people dressed up in all sorts of different costumes.
[03:39:43.538 --> 03:39:44.498]  They don't even know
[03:39:44.938 --> 03:39:45.498]  We're good to go.
[03:40:05.251 --> 03:40:06.853]  That's him breaking.
[03:40:06.853 --> 03:40:11.759]  That's him breaking and getting violent with someone he's probably never even met before.
[03:40:11.759 --> 03:40:19.988]  And probably if they met in a coffee shop, would actually sit down and be able to sit next to each other and have no problem whatsoever with each other.
[03:40:19.988 --> 03:40:22.672]  You know, Owen and I were walking down the street later after the event.
[03:40:22.672 --> 03:40:23.773]  We were going to grab a bite to eat.
[03:40:24.688 --> 03:40:28.169]  At the diner up towards Times Square from where the event was.
[03:40:28.169 --> 03:40:31.631]  And, you know, we're walking down the street and he had that same Trump scarf on.
[03:40:31.631 --> 03:40:38.394]  And somebody came up to him and on the side of the street and said, hey, man, you guys are going to get jumped if you if you if you dress like that.
[03:40:38.394 --> 03:40:39.854]  And we were like, what, with suits?
[03:40:39.854 --> 03:40:53.280]  And he's like, you pointed at the scarf and said and we thought you are so triggered by someone's scarf that you feel that you have to get violent because you didn't like his scarf because his scarf triggered you that much.
[03:40:53.280 --> 03:40:53.520]  That's
[03:40:54.463 --> 03:41:08.476]  The brittle, soft, thin-skinned anger and vitriol of the left because they can't stand the fact that Trump won and that they've been pushed further and further into this madness and it's brainwashing is what it really is.
[03:41:08.476 --> 03:41:09.137]  It's brainwashing.
[03:41:09.397 --> 03:41:09.577]  I don't
[03:41:32.904 --> 03:41:34.545]  From the Trump supporters ourselves.
[03:41:34.545 --> 03:41:35.826]  You don't see that whatsoever.
[03:41:35.826 --> 03:41:39.028]  So I'll put that up in front of anybody else.
[03:41:39.028 --> 03:41:48.433]  I'll say, show me a conservative speaker at a liberal campus and let's see how they're treated at UC Berkeley, at Columbia, the numerous times this has happened.
[03:41:48.433 --> 03:41:55.637]  However, let's now see an icon, an icon of the left, Chelsea Manning, whose sentence was commuted by Obama, right?
[03:41:55.637 --> 03:42:00.480]  An icon of the left who comes into a Trump event and is treated warmly and is treated fairly.
[03:42:00.960 --> 03:42:02.802]  That is the proof, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:42:02.802 --> 03:42:05.884]  That is the proof that we can take the moral high road.
[03:42:05.884 --> 03:42:07.605]  That we are the tolerant side.
[03:42:07.605 --> 03:42:10.708]  That we are the side that stands for freedom of speech.
[03:42:10.708 --> 03:42:17.273]  That we are the side that actually understands that you have to talk to people, even if people that you don't like.
[03:42:17.273 --> 03:42:19.234]  Even people that you disagree with.
[03:42:19.234 --> 03:42:24.138]  That we can still actually have a conversation because that's what freedom of speech means.
[03:42:24.947 --> 03:42:30.691]  Sure, we'll beat you, but we'll beat you at the ballot box and we'll beat you peacefully in an election.
[03:42:30.691 --> 03:42:33.854]  We're not going to take our violence into our hands, right?
[03:42:33.854 --> 03:42:37.756]  We're not going to take it into our hands and assault you and beat you down.
[03:42:37.756 --> 03:42:43.080]  That is the difference and that is why we've always stood for peace and we always will stand for peace.
[03:42:43.080 --> 03:42:46.463]  And Antifa, they're going to be going to jail.
[03:42:46.463 --> 03:42:50.445]  Every single one of them that was connected to this attack.
[03:42:50.445 --> 03:42:51.046]  More after the break.
[03:42:52.148 --> 03:42:58.153]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.

[03:43:10.322 --> 03:43:17.486]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[03:44:00.570 --> 03:44:05.135]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:44:05.135 --> 03:44:08.259]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:44:08.259 --> 03:44:11.383]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:44:12.884 --> 03:44:25.710]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:44:25.710 --> 03:44:40.777]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[03:46:55.781 --> 03:46:58.423]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.793 --> 03:47:28.799]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:28.799 --> 03:47:34.902]  Jack Pacific back, rounding out the big fourth hour here and we actually have breaking news from Washington, D.C.
[03:47:34.902 --> 03:47:36.783]  So I'm here in Washington, D.C.
[03:47:36.783 --> 03:47:38.904]  I got down from New York this weekend but
[03:47:39.608 --> 03:47:45.436]  The government was shut down over the weekend, and I just have a quick question for everyone out in the listening audience, everyone within sound of my voice.
[03:47:45.436 --> 03:47:46.697]  Did you notice?
[03:47:46.697 --> 03:47:49.721]  Did you notice that the government was apparently shut down for three days?
[03:47:49.721 --> 03:47:51.623]  I honestly, I didn't notice.
[03:47:51.623 --> 03:47:54.427]  I didn't really notice very much, didn't notice any difference.
[03:47:54.427 --> 03:47:55.869]  I may have felt a little freer.
[03:47:55.869 --> 03:47:58.151]  I felt like I may have had a little bit more liberty over the weekends.
[03:47:58.812 --> 03:48:06.938]  Kind of say that was nice, but yeah, didn't really find any major significant impact in my day-to-day life from the government being shut down.
[03:48:06.938 --> 03:48:10.840]  Pretty much seemed like everything that affected us and affected our lives was still there.
[03:48:10.840 --> 03:48:17.064]  But the Democrats that led this shutdown, led by Chuck Schumer in the U.S.
[03:48:17.064 --> 03:48:19.326]  Senate, they've caved.
[03:48:19.326 --> 03:48:22.428]  They've completely and utterly caved.
[03:48:23.234 --> 03:48:24.055]  They've dropped.
[03:48:24.055 --> 03:48:25.816]  We've got the 60 votes.
[03:48:25.816 --> 03:48:27.698]  The government shutdown is over.
[03:48:27.698 --> 03:48:37.307]  They've totally caved to completely and utterly give Trump everything that he wanted.
[03:48:37.307 --> 03:48:38.608]  What did they get out of it?
[03:48:38.608 --> 03:48:38.868]  Nothing.
[03:48:39.508 --> 03:48:40.289]  They blinked.
[03:48:40.289 --> 03:48:44.852]  They tried to go into an eye-to-eye stare with the president.
[03:48:44.852 --> 03:48:47.213]  The man who wrote Art of the Deal.
[03:48:47.213 --> 03:48:51.276]  Why would you try to hard negotiate with the man who wrote Art of the Deal?
[03:48:51.276 --> 03:48:57.761]  It's probably... Honestly, the man is a best-selling author who's most known for tough negotiation.
[03:48:57.761 --> 03:48:59.082]  You don't try to do that.
[03:48:59.082 --> 03:49:04.886]  You assume he's going to beat you and then you just try to skip that part and actually talk about what you can get out of the deal.
[03:49:04.886 --> 03:49:07.748]  You don't try to do the hard negotiation because he destroys you.
[03:49:07.748 --> 03:49:09.169]  And Schumer, oh my goodness.
[03:49:09.901 --> 03:49:14.402]  You know, people were saying, people were saying, boy, I thought Steve Bannon had a bad January.
[03:49:14.402 --> 03:49:16.823]  Schumer, he goes, hold my vodka.
[03:49:16.823 --> 03:49:23.044]  This guy, this guy tried to go toe-to-toe with the dealmaker-in-chief and he lost.
[03:49:23.044 --> 03:49:24.224]  He embarrassed himself.
[03:49:24.224 --> 03:49:26.745]  He embarrassed the Democrat Party.
[03:49:26.745 --> 03:49:36.727]  81 votes they just got on the motion to get rid of this thing because they all thought, even his own party, realized what stupid of an idea this was.
[03:49:36.727 --> 03:49:38.768]  And they were completely destroyed because here's the thing.
[03:49:39.688 --> 03:49:43.329]  The Democrats, what was their talking point throughout the entire time?
[03:49:43.329 --> 03:49:44.809]  It was DACA, right?
[03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:46.950]  They kept talking about DACA, DACA, DACA, DACA.
[03:49:46.950 --> 03:49:47.590]  We need DACA.
[03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:49.010]  We've got to help DACA.
[03:49:49.010 --> 03:50:01.994]  And Trump, on the other hand, and everyone on the right, turned around and said, so you're putting illegal immigrants over the needs of the American citizens that you actually represent in Congress.
[03:50:01.994 --> 03:50:02.954]  You know, your job.
[03:50:03.655 --> 03:50:08.419]  The people who pay your wages, who pay your salary, who pay for your junkets around the world.
[03:50:08.419 --> 03:50:09.200]  Those are the people.
[03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:10.641]  No, you're not representing them.
[03:50:10.641 --> 03:50:11.822]  You're representing...
[03:50:12.654 --> 03:50:13.475]  Illegal immigrants.
[03:50:13.475 --> 03:50:18.178]  You're fighting for the rights of illegal immigrants, and that's why you've decided to shut down the government.
[03:50:18.178 --> 03:50:22.861]  Even the New York Times admitted that it was the Democrats who shut down the government.
[03:50:22.861 --> 03:50:28.445]  So when even the New York Times is calling you out, you know you've done something a little bit foolish.
[03:50:28.445 --> 03:50:32.128]  And Schumer, I mean, his negotiating tactic, I don't quite understand what it is.
[03:50:32.128 --> 03:50:41.975]  It's, we're going to shut down the government, hold the government hostage, and then get nothing in return, give the Republicans everything they want, give Trump everything he wants,
[03:50:42.655 --> 03:50:45.639]  And walk away like cowards?
[03:50:45.639 --> 03:50:52.127]  Not exactly sure that's the kind of face you want to be showing when you're in a midterm election year and you're trying to show leadership.
[03:50:52.799 --> 03:50:54.540]  There's a great line from Schumer as well.
[03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:58.203]  He said, he said, well, in the negotiations, I couldn't understand what was going on.
[03:50:58.203 --> 03:51:06.230]  We would sit down with Trump and first he would say one thing, then he would say something else that would sound like he completely flip-flopped and disagreed with what he said before.
[03:51:06.230 --> 03:51:07.291]  He said this thing.
[03:51:07.291 --> 03:51:07.931]  He said that thing.
[03:51:07.931 --> 03:51:11.154]  He was completely confused, had no idea what was going on.
[03:51:11.154 --> 03:51:18.360]  And then Schumer left, left the, left the president's, I guess, the Oval Office and had no idea what was going on because guys,
[03:51:18.900 --> 03:51:21.262]  That's what Trump does.
[03:51:21.262 --> 03:51:23.024]  He wrote a book about this.
[03:51:23.024 --> 03:51:24.045]  You could have read it.
[03:51:24.045 --> 03:51:24.606]  It's like $19.95.
[03:51:24.606 --> 03:51:25.306]  It's $20.
[03:51:25.306 --> 03:51:29.450]  You guys, you make less, more than that per DM.
[03:51:29.450 --> 03:51:31.172]  Go buy a copy of Art of the Deal.
[03:51:31.172 --> 03:51:33.354]  But you won't because you're lazy and you're stupid.
[03:51:33.354 --> 03:51:37.858]  Because you don't understand what it's like dealing with the master negotiator like President Trump.
[03:51:37.878 --> 03:51:39.139]  We're good to go.
[03:51:56.576 --> 03:51:58.037]  He wanted you to think that.
[03:51:58.037 --> 03:51:59.457]  And they said, we can't talk to this guy.
[03:51:59.457 --> 03:52:00.437]  This guy's nuts.
[03:52:00.437 --> 03:52:01.398]  We'll go talk to McConnell.
[03:52:01.398 --> 03:52:03.338]  And McConnell says, all right, here's what we're going to do.
[03:52:03.338 --> 03:52:04.639]  We're going to open the government.
[03:52:04.639 --> 03:52:07.600]  You guys are going to stop standing up for illegal immigrants.
[03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:08.720]  And then you're going to go home.
[03:52:08.720 --> 03:52:09.721]  And they said, fine.
[03:52:09.721 --> 03:52:12.241]  And so the left is losing their minds at Schumer.
[03:52:12.241 --> 03:52:13.722]  They're saying, how could you do this?
[03:52:13.722 --> 03:52:19.144]  You put the entire credibility of our party on the line for this.
[03:52:19.144 --> 03:52:19.984]  And you folded.
[03:52:19.984 --> 03:52:22.145]  You folded like a cheap suit.
[03:52:22.145 --> 03:52:23.525]  Should have read Art of the Deal.
[03:52:23.525 --> 03:52:25.486]  Should have read Art of the Deal, Chucky Bull.
[03:52:25.886 --> 03:52:26.787]  That's all I got to say.
[03:52:26.787 --> 03:52:28.908]  I don't understand this tactic.
[03:52:28.908 --> 03:52:31.229]  If there's a name for it, you call it the Schumer strategy, I guess.
[03:52:31.229 --> 03:52:37.272]  The Schumer strategy is you hold the government hostage and then you give up without asking for anything in return.
[03:52:38.195 --> 03:52:46.417]  Not exactly sure how you win at poker when you lose every hand of cards and you always lose a bet.
[03:52:46.417 --> 03:52:48.837]  Not exactly sure how that's a winning strategy, Chuck.
[03:52:48.837 --> 03:53:07.581]  And I've got to give a huge hand, a huge hand to our president here because this shows the power of Donald Trump, the man, not just the president, but Donald Trump, the man, when it comes to these types of negotiations, which he's known for throughout New York, where he's known for being
[03:53:08.487 --> 03:53:09.147]  The best.
[03:53:09.147 --> 03:53:13.489]  And people used to laugh, people used to laugh when Trump supporters said they'd get sick of winning.
[03:53:13.489 --> 03:53:15.069]  And there you go, boom.
[03:53:15.069 --> 03:53:19.871]  The Wall Street Journal admitting that it's called the Schumer surrender.
[03:53:19.871 --> 03:53:23.732]  We've got the Schumer, first we had the Schumer shutdown, and now we've got the Schumer surrender.
[03:53:23.732 --> 03:53:25.893]  See, that alliteration always works, by the way.
[03:53:25.893 --> 03:53:28.254]  It always works when you can use that alliteration.
[03:53:28.254 --> 03:53:28.974]  It's catchy.
[03:53:28.974 --> 03:53:30.474]  Schumer shutdown, Schumer shutdown.
[03:53:30.474 --> 03:53:31.415]  It sticks in your head.
[03:53:31.415 --> 03:53:35.096]  Now that I've said it a few times, you can't stop thinking about it because it's that great.
[03:53:35.996 --> 03:53:38.680]  Schumer surrender.
[03:53:38.680 --> 03:53:40.162]  That's a bit of a tongue twister.
[03:53:40.162 --> 03:53:41.003]  Say it 10 times fast.
[03:53:41.003 --> 03:53:42.064]  I don't think you can.
[03:53:42.064 --> 03:53:45.709]  That's what the president does.
[03:53:45.709 --> 03:53:48.492]  He gets into these negotiations and he wins.
[03:53:48.492 --> 03:53:52.497]  He brings home a win for the American people first.
[03:53:52.497 --> 03:53:53.859]  It's America first.
[03:53:54.633 --> 03:54:00.435]  The President said that he agrees that we should come up with a way to deal with the Dreamers fairly.
[03:54:00.435 --> 03:54:07.959]  That they should be vetted, that it should be gone through and looked on a case-by-case basis, and that they should be treated fairly and compassionately.
[03:54:07.959 --> 03:54:11.120]  And I think most people would say yes, that that's fair.
[03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:13.901]  That we have to look to see, are there people who have committed crimes?
[03:54:13.901 --> 03:54:14.821]  Will they need to go first?
[03:54:14.821 --> 03:54:16.422]  Are there people that, what are they doing here?
[03:54:16.422 --> 03:54:17.422]  Are they living off of welfare?
[03:54:17.422 --> 03:54:18.403]  Are they starting businesses?
[03:54:18.403 --> 03:54:20.904]  Those people, all of those things need to be looked at, right?
[03:54:21.934 --> 03:54:23.875]  He already was going to do it.
[03:54:23.875 --> 03:54:25.075]  He was going to do it anyway.
[03:54:25.075 --> 03:54:26.635]  He had told the Democrats that.
[03:54:26.635 --> 03:54:34.498]  But then last week, they completely blew up these negotiations because Durbin came out and started making these crazy statements.
[03:54:34.498 --> 03:54:36.218]  And the president said, fine, you know what?
[03:54:36.218 --> 03:54:37.618]  I don't need to talk to you people.
[03:54:37.618 --> 03:54:38.819]  You guys are going to lie about me.
[03:54:38.819 --> 03:54:41.680]  You're going to mischaracterize what I said in a private meeting.
[03:54:41.680 --> 03:54:44.961]  You're going to operate and negotiate in bad faith.
[03:54:44.961 --> 03:54:46.541]  Then I don't need to talk to you and I'm done.
[03:54:47.216 --> 03:54:50.378]  That's how you negotiate, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:50.378 --> 03:54:51.419]  That's how you negotiate.
[03:54:51.419 --> 03:55:06.368]  And just as a quick thing to kind of put out here towards the end of this, because I know it's been in the news so much over the weekend, talking about these FBI text messages that supposedly the FBI lost five months, right?
[03:55:06.368 --> 03:55:08.389]  Probably thousands of text messages.
[03:55:09.421 --> 03:55:17.126]  Between Peter Strzok and his mistress, right, Lisa Page, his Jezebel, if you were, they lost five months of this.
[03:55:17.126 --> 03:55:21.249]  And keep in mind, the media keeps calling them, oh, he's just an agent, he's just an FBI agent.
[03:55:21.249 --> 03:55:25.332]  No, he's the deputy director of the Counterintelligence Division.
[03:55:25.332 --> 03:55:29.274]  This is someone who does false flags off-co for a living.
[03:55:29.274 --> 03:55:31.116]  He does these type of operations.
[03:55:31.116 --> 03:55:33.117]  He knows how all of this stuff works.
[03:55:33.417 --> 03:55:50.430]  And I've got to say, the FBI technical system, so that means they lost it on his BlackBerry, her BlackBerry, the system that actually runs the router that runs the text messages, and the archive server as well, all lost the text messages at the same time, somehow.
[03:55:50.430 --> 03:55:52.071]  Folks, we know what that means.
[03:55:52.071 --> 03:55:56.694]  Unless, the only explanation that I would accept at this point, that who was running your IT?
[03:55:56.694 --> 03:55:57.655]  The A1 brothers?
[03:55:58.482 --> 03:56:05.071]  Couple of nice Awan brothers out of Pakistan like we have with Ted Lieu and Debbie Wasserman Schultz over at the DNC side.
[03:56:05.071 --> 03:56:07.334]  Or maybe we could actually ask the Awan brothers.
[03:56:07.334 --> 03:56:09.257]  Maybe they do actually have these text messages.
[03:56:09.257 --> 03:56:10.579]  So people are...
[03:56:11.226 --> 03:56:15.248]  They're smelling it for what it is and they say this is fishy and it stinks.
[03:56:15.248 --> 03:56:22.031]  Because they know that all of the text messages that have come out so far, they talk about an insurance policy.
[03:56:22.031 --> 03:56:25.933]  They talk about Lynch knowing that there were going to be no charges against Clinton.
[03:56:25.933 --> 03:56:28.834]  How would you know that before the investigation ended?
[03:56:28.834 --> 03:56:36.458]  Now my sources, people I've talked to in DC, state that what is in those missing text messages is absolutely damning.
[03:56:37.006 --> 03:56:52.757]  For them and for the FBI and these agents, the Deputy Director of the Counterintelligence Division, who is running the Russia investigation, who is running the Hillary email investigation, that it talks about potentially another further insurance policy that could be used against President Trump.
[03:56:52.757 --> 03:57:00.682]  And the time period, and this is key, the time period that they're missing was the transition period and the first days of the Trump
[03:57:01.346 --> 03:57:01.906]  Administration.
[03:57:01.906 --> 03:57:02.306]  There you go.
[03:57:02.306 --> 03:57:03.006]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:03.006 --> 03:57:03.767]  Emails deleted.
[03:57:03.767 --> 03:57:04.307]  NSA.
[03:57:04.307 --> 03:57:05.287]  Emails deleted.
[03:57:05.287 --> 03:57:05.687]  FBI.
[03:57:05.687 --> 03:57:06.848]  Text messages deleted.
[03:57:06.848 --> 03:57:10.328]  Imagine going to the FBI when you're under investigation saying, I'm sorry.
[03:57:10.328 --> 03:57:12.969]  I deleted all of those records you guys wanted.
[03:57:12.969 --> 03:57:14.650]  Try telling that to the IRS in April.
[03:57:14.650 --> 03:57:15.370]  I'm so sorry.
[03:57:15.370 --> 03:57:17.330]  I deleted all of my receipts for this year.
[03:57:17.330 --> 03:57:18.531]  But don't worry about it.
[03:57:18.531 --> 03:57:19.311]  There's nothing in there.
[03:57:19.311 --> 03:57:23.492]  Folks, that is the deep state right there telling you that they are losing.
[03:57:23.912 --> 03:57:32.336]  That they are on the ropes because Trump and this movement of new nationalism and new patriotism that's sweeping the land is pushing back against them.
[03:57:32.336 --> 03:57:33.597]  They know their hour is up.
[03:57:33.597 --> 03:57:39.420]  They know they're reaching the end of the line and it's because of the info warriors and people like you listening today.
[03:57:39.420 --> 03:57:40.720]  Thank you so much for listening.

[03:59:09.591 --> 03:59:10.711]  It's a great deal at $39.

[03:59:14.193 --> 03:59:15.714]  And so much more.
[03:59:15.714 --> 03:59:17.075]  It is concentrated.

[03:59:24.620 --> 03:59:25.821]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:59:25.821 --> 03:59:27.842]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:59:27.842 --> 03:59:30.444]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:59:30.444 --> 03:59:31.865]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:59:31.865 --> 03:59:34.246]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:59:34.246 --> 03:59:34.947]  Immune Wall.
