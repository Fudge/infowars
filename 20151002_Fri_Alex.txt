[00:00.000 --> 00:14.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.640 --> 00:23.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones you know I homeland
[00:23.240 --> 00:28.080]  security says that veterans are the number one enemy the number one terror threat because every
[00:28.080 --> 00:33.040]  time there's a mass shooting every time there's criminal activity going on in a vet is nearby
[00:33.040 --> 00:39.720]  they either take out who's doing it or die trying and that's why they want to single out
[00:39.720 --> 00:45.080]  vets in this country is because they're afraid of empowered individuals who will take action in
[00:45.080 --> 00:49.080]  our cowards and that's all you need to know about people run this government as they fund
[00:49.080 --> 00:56.720]  al-Qaeda they criticize Russia for bombing al-Qaeda and they would demonize veterans
[00:56.720 --> 01:04.960]  when statistically veterans commit some of the lowest levels of crime out there after old women
[01:04.960 --> 01:11.720]  and they know what the difference is a lot of vets out there are going to be pushed around by a
[01:11.720 --> 01:17.680]  bunch of scum in this government that's how open the show today because I was just looking at the
[01:17.680 --> 01:25.760]  story at NBC news Oregon shooting heroic veteran Chris Mince was shot seven times trying to save
[01:25.760 --> 01:30.320]  people as they were being killed by this cowardly scumbag who wanted attention and hated Christians
[01:30.320 --> 01:38.360]  another big Obama supporter and they advertise the new fetish going into victim disarmament zones
[01:38.360 --> 01:47.080]  and shooting people and so it happens again month or so ago it was a racially motivated crazy black
[01:47.080 --> 01:54.040]  guy few months before that it was a racially motivated crazy white guy and now there's some
[01:54.040 --> 02:04.080]  racially Christian motivated mixed race guy what they all got in common is they're crazy scum and
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.880]  people have a right to defend themselves against trash like this that's what it comes down to in
[02:08.880 --> 02:15.240]  the final equation another armed Air Force vet was prevented from stopping Oregon gunmen they were
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.000]  at the military center on the edge of the campus and were blocked from getting in there and were
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.800]  locked down by the police it's a total death trap that's that's what these mass execution centers
[02:26.800 --> 02:32.360]  are when you put your children in it when you put your money in them you support these dumb
[02:32.360 --> 02:38.720]  universities that are giving you worthless degrees eight times out of ten yeah about 20% of the
[02:38.720 --> 02:47.760]  degrees are worse something engineering science medical business but not none all the rest of
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.880]  the degrees you put your money in these institutions without reforming them you allow them to take
[02:52.880 --> 02:59.840]  over the culture and allow them to continue their disgusting anti-human anti-family anti-male
[02:59.840 --> 03:08.760]  anti-female anti-child anti-life agenda you know it hit me this morning I woke up at about 6 a.m.
[03:08.760 --> 03:12.880]  with a pounding headache and I'll be honest I'm not gonna be hypocrite here I'm gonna put on
[03:12.880 --> 03:19.000]  airs or lie I went out to see Billy Otto last night and then I guess the crew was down there
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.200]  and nearby establishment heard I was there Joe Biggs Joe Jennings Darren McBrain Marcus
[03:24.200 --> 03:29.440]  Morales and I have not had a lot to drink like that since I was in college and they
[03:29.440 --> 03:39.800]  bought me a bunch of shots of what was it Yeagermeister and I feel like my brain has been taken out
[03:39.800 --> 03:47.960]  with a melon baller right now but I think you're gonna have a good broadcast today but back to
[03:47.960 --> 03:52.120]  what I was getting to sad to tell a story in the context I wasn't gonna tell that story it was
[03:52.120 --> 03:58.800]  just part of it I went back to 6 a.m. this morning waking up good news is I was not driving I'm very
[03:58.800 --> 04:04.280]  proud of myself Uber's a wonderful thing even though it's a horrible thing Uber's the worst of
[04:04.280 --> 04:09.080]  times the best of times to horrible Democrat run monopoly where they keep regulations on the cab
[04:09.080 --> 04:13.280]  drivers on purpose so that they can't compete and don't let anybody else in business but only
[04:13.280 --> 04:17.680]  Roman manuals brother they can make billions while raking it all in worldwide in liberal cities
[04:17.680 --> 04:23.200]  running game on their moron constituents anyway side issue see that's the key to regulations
[04:23.200 --> 04:31.720]  they're always applied selectively by socialists but I digress it just hit me how uncool it is to
[04:31.720 --> 04:37.680]  be anti-human with all the epic things humanity's done how amazing we are with how fun humanity is
[04:37.680 --> 04:44.400]  these people just are not fans of humanity and so they need to well you know what they need to do
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.720]  don't you and if they didn't have us to feed on that's what they do and crawl in their halls and
[04:49.720 --> 04:56.880]  they die you human-hating weak chicken-neck collections of cowards that want to urinate on
[04:56.880 --> 05:02.280]  the corpse of humanity I got a better idea do you know what it means to be an American it's more
[05:02.280 --> 05:07.560]  than a flag it's more than knowing the star-spangled banner it's knowing the Constitution
[05:07.560 --> 05:12.800]  it's understanding those rights and fighting for them our country's falling apart because people
[05:12.800 --> 05:18.160]  have forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing is putting your
[05:18.160 --> 05:23.200]  life on the line to protect your country from enemies both foreign and domestic the Bill of
[05:23.200 --> 05:28.560]  Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse
[05:28.560 --> 05:34.640]  or rest on inference so the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood
[05:34.640 --> 05:40.600]  of patriots and tyrants I'm Joe Biggs with info wars dot com and I believe our flag is more than
[05:40.600 --> 05:45.680]  cloth and ink it is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom it is a history of our

[09:42.600 --> 09:49.040]  last night by the way hey look at this little doozy story HHS health and human services boosting
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.960]  nation stockpile of burn treatments in case of nuclear attack yeah I'd say rolling in cruise
[09:54.960 --> 10:03.600]  missiles and truck launched missiles and frogs tactical nuclear weapons up against the Russian
[10:03.600 --> 10:11.760]  border you might want to stock up on on your burn treatment supplies doing that Iraq would welcome
[10:11.760 --> 10:21.160]  Russian strikes against Islamic State says their president former security guard at Oregon College
[10:21.160 --> 10:26.600]  where 10 were killed lockdown procedures were a death trap well that's what they're designed to do
[10:26.600 --> 10:36.120]  then they advertise this is where you go to kill people selective outrage Obama hasn't said a single
[10:36.120 --> 10:42.360]  word about routine mass shootings in Chicago two of which happened yesterday and that brings me of
[10:42.360 --> 10:49.160]  course to our top story today ladies and gentlemen it's not that foreign troops from China Iran and
[10:49.160 --> 10:55.640]  Russia are piling into Syria to fight the United States of America and Europe bankrolling al-Qaeda
[10:56.440 --> 11:00.760]  no that's not our top story it's not our top story that was in the Associated Press Reuters
[11:00.760 --> 11:06.920]  the New York Times just that I saw yesterday with the State Department criticizing Russia and the
[11:06.920 --> 11:19.400]  Pentagon criticizing Russia and the Secretary of Defense criticizing Russia for bombing al-Qaeda
[11:20.520 --> 11:26.920]  instead of ISIS I actually read that in headlines and saw that on the news with a straight face
[11:26.920 --> 11:32.760]  they are testing you they know the words coming out it's going to come out the 28 pages the criminal
[11:32.760 --> 11:39.080]  elements of our government with Saudi Arabia ran 9-11 and so they're just I guess they'll come out
[11:39.080 --> 11:43.000]  and announce yeah we did it because we're patriots and if you don't support the government blowing
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.840]  up the World Trade Centers and building seven you're not a patriot if you don't support blowing
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.640]  up the World Trade Centers I get it you're a Russian spy yeah that'd be a good headline
[11:53.640 --> 12:00.440]  and I'm not even joking anymore they're mainlining that our government runs al-Qaeda right now
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.000]  thinking the public's so dumb they'll go big deal what you're not a patriot you don't support al-Qaeda
[12:08.920 --> 12:15.080]  this is the level of satire we've reached because Carl Rove but also Nancy Pelosi they all make
[12:15.080 --> 12:21.320]  similar statements said they control reality no you don't you dumb witch you may control
[12:21.320 --> 12:25.960]  given the orders to get Botox every week where you look like a rubber face a rubber chicken
[12:25.960 --> 12:32.760]  a secretary of state Kerry you both look like the same person but you don't control reality
[12:32.760 --> 12:38.040]  you dumb witch you're not going to live forever you're not a god you're a pile of you know what
[12:38.600 --> 12:45.240]  a steaming pile of horse manure but that's not even kind because horse manure has nutrients for
[12:45.240 --> 12:52.600]  the soil and the insects in the grass in it I mean we just have to hate these people we just
[12:52.600 --> 12:58.440]  have to fully throw them up like poison in our stomach we have to get them out of this they
[12:58.440 --> 13:05.560]  are anathema and evil always tends to take over historically during cycles because good people just
[13:06.120 --> 13:12.040]  are blind we we are blind we just cannot get our minds around the dishonor the cowardliness
[13:12.040 --> 13:18.200]  the scumminess the weakness the filth of wanting to inject billions of people with vaccines to
[13:18.200 --> 13:23.240]  cripple their minds and give them cancer at a young age the globalists get off on that
[13:23.240 --> 13:30.680]  and so we can't even get our minds around it because it's a thousand trillion trillion miles away
[13:30.680 --> 13:37.720]  from where we are these people have crawled out of the pit of hell to feed on our children and
[13:37.720 --> 13:44.760]  sell their body parts and to splice every creation God's made together in abominations see for the
[13:44.760 --> 13:54.200]  globalists the journey is the destination dominating us poisoning us hurting us destabilizing us is
[13:54.200 --> 14:00.360]  their God and the minute see once the illusion breaks once the trance breaks we'll just be like
[14:00.360 --> 14:05.800]  whoa whoa I was in a trance why'd I ever put up with this and you see the trance is falling
[14:05.800 --> 14:09.080]  when they have one failure and I've always explained this to everyone like they've had
[14:09.080 --> 14:16.440]  taken our guns I said this five years ago when they have one failure on a major initiative
[14:16.440 --> 14:23.000]  every domino starts falling and these churches are there to tell you that it's the end of the
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.920]  world and that there's nothing we can do and we have to give in because it's all over folks
[14:28.920 --> 14:35.400]  it's free will we have free will yes the world will end yes the antichrist will come to power
[14:35.400 --> 14:43.640]  yes all this will happen if we let it happen people say oh it's all in God's plan we are God's plan
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.680]  and yes undoubtedly to test humanity the technology the evil will get to a point
[14:50.680 --> 14:55.160]  whether it's five years from now or a hundred years from now where it will overwhelm humanity to
[14:55.160 --> 15:01.880]  such a core level that God will step in but God's already stepping in through you who do you think
[15:01.880 --> 15:06.600]  you are who do you think I am we are manifestations of God's will on this planet
[15:07.880 --> 15:12.360]  and the sooner we start realizing that and realize why the enemy hates us and desperately
[15:12.360 --> 15:22.200]  poisons us because we're like 5 000 foot shining platinum giants to the new world order do you
[15:22.200 --> 15:34.760]  understand that we're fire breathing god zealous to them they hate us folks they hate you they hate
[15:34.760 --> 15:40.920]  your children they hate your wife they hate your husband they hate corn they hate wheat they hate
[15:40.920 --> 15:46.120]  watermelons they hate sunlight they hate the sky why do you think the EPA came out and attacked
[15:46.120 --> 15:51.480]  sunlight two days ago and said it's bad why do you think Cass Sunstein wants to make a law where
[15:51.480 --> 16:00.600]  you can't say sunlight is good for you every doctor until 20 years ago said your kid's sick
[16:00.600 --> 16:06.040]  you're sick get out get some sunlight yeah sunlight will kill you but not having it will kill you
[16:06.040 --> 16:11.080]  quicker you understand that you understand that the sun will set you free ladies and gentlemen
[16:11.080 --> 16:18.680]  that's why they hate it these people are literally vampires and by literally the legends of vampires
[16:18.680 --> 16:25.880]  are only a wives tale around the fire to describe what the elite are to kids that aren't that complex
[16:25.880 --> 16:30.920]  to understand you stay away from the castle and you don't get near the castle at night and you
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.800]  don't fish down there in those ponds by the castle because there are people that will grab you and
[16:35.800 --> 16:42.200]  will put you in a dungeon and will drink your blood now do those people live forever no but they
[16:42.200 --> 16:49.240]  will grab you and they will torture you and they will drink your blood they are vampires and that's
[16:49.240 --> 16:55.400]  what we're facing folks and until we realize that these are people that hate the sun these are people
[16:55.400 --> 17:02.840]  that hate life these people are from hell they're from another dimension they don't like us and it's
[17:02.840 --> 17:09.480]  time to stop liking them do you understand that you you do not admit they're evil you do not admit
[17:09.480 --> 17:15.080]  they're out to get you they win you're under a trance you're blind you must break your trance
[17:15.080 --> 17:21.560]  you must admit it and only then can you transcend these people that's the moment you're free is
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.800]  the moment you put the glasses on that's why i love rowdy pipe arrested soul a listener and a great
[17:25.800 --> 17:32.840]  patriot such a such an allegorical key scene of coming out of play does cave when he says to
[17:32.840 --> 17:37.800]  his good friend the only friend he's got his whole family's died from what the globalist are put
[17:37.800 --> 17:42.280]  to the food in the water the society's crumbling they're telling him it's great he says man it all
[17:42.280 --> 17:47.880]  makes sense now just put these glasses on or start eating concrete because i love you enough
[17:47.880 --> 17:51.880]  that i'm gonna get in a fight with you and we're gonna hurt each other real bad but it doesn't
[17:51.880 --> 17:56.280]  matter you're gonna put these on and then once you put these glasses on you're gonna realize how
[17:56.280 --> 18:01.160]  stupid it is you think i want to fight with cops you think i want to fight with black people you
[18:01.160 --> 18:05.400]  think i want to fight with mexicans you think i want to fight with midwestern white people you
[18:05.400 --> 18:09.480]  think i want to fight with arabs or muslims think i want to fight with christians you think i want
[18:09.480 --> 18:15.640]  to know i want to empower and see people free and the minute you put the glasses on it's a decision
[18:15.640 --> 18:20.440]  and really look at what we're facing it'll all be a joke it won't matter that we just beat the
[18:20.440 --> 18:25.960]  hell out of each other it won't matter all the stupid stuff they put between us once we understand
[18:25.960 --> 18:31.720]  it was all done to us on purpose to keep us blind from the truth you can break that trance
[18:31.720 --> 18:37.320]  just like that the minute you want to you could be free the second you decide it's all about free will
[18:38.200 --> 18:43.800]  but let me warn you about something and i'm not copying the matrix it's an allegory it's always
[18:43.800 --> 18:49.640]  been true all i'm offering is the truth nothing more because once you realize the true horror of
[18:49.640 --> 18:54.440]  this it's going to change your world forever and you're not going to be able to just sit there calmly
[18:54.440 --> 18:59.480]  anymore and go through your bumbling life worried about fantasy football or acting tough to your buddies
[18:59.480 --> 19:04.360]  because when you hit the rock bottom of this situation you're going to get the million mile
[19:04.360 --> 19:10.520]  view of the whole stinking thing and there's no coming back from that rabbit hole but here's the
[19:10.520 --> 19:17.880]  secret you're already in the rabbit hole the secret is this is all about the choice you're
[19:17.880 --> 19:24.520]  going to make you want to sign on to funding al-qaeda you want to sign on to babies having their
[19:24.520 --> 19:31.000]  organs harvested you want to sign on to mutating god's creation you want to sign on to this because

[24:30.200 --> 24:38.040]  intend to do a radio show or a tv show or a documentary or maybe a book about the fabulous

[25:06.760 --> 25:13.240]  act of being able to see the universe around you and then commune with it and see the beauty in it
[25:13.240 --> 25:24.120]  is the transcendence to the fifth dimension into god's realm the love of creation the love of the
[25:24.120 --> 25:29.720]  creator and i didn't read any of this in a book it's written on my heart it's written on my mind
[25:31.320 --> 25:35.000]  and i follow my instinctive spiritual understanding of things
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.600]  with the assurance of a sleepwalker
[25:46.360 --> 25:52.120]  and i see people in bondage i see men who are so insecure and feel so inadequate

[27:11.000 --> 27:16.680]  we've got the big article that was in the new york times was on drudge last week the pentagon's
[27:16.680 --> 27:22.680]  brain an uncensored history of darpa america's top secret military research agency
[27:22.680 --> 27:31.000]  annie jackson let me tell you i haven't read this book yet but i've read the boil down and i know
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.600]  most of what's in it but what's i'm not bragging what i'm saying is i know it's accurate from what
[27:36.600 --> 27:42.120]  i read in the synopsis but when you read it all together it just is crazy and then the stuff
[27:42.120 --> 27:46.520]  that's not in the book that i can bring up when this lady's on and some of it's classified
[27:46.520 --> 27:56.120]  it's just crazy they've got vaccines that are basically nanotech already but they're not using
[27:56.120 --> 28:04.040]  them because it it creates it is a galactic crime to end free will without people accepting
[28:04.840 --> 28:09.080]  that's why they say vaccines the law but they're not really they want to intimidate you into it
[28:09.080 --> 28:17.080]  because you've got to do it by free will even if it's coercion you've still got to do it i mean
[28:17.080 --> 28:23.320]  these people are so bad can you imagine wanting to brain damage the entire population so you can
[28:23.320 --> 28:32.520]  rule a bunch of zombies i mean that is so satanic that that is that is satanism see satanists claim
[28:32.520 --> 28:37.560]  they're about free will and human empowerment no you're not and once your teeth are down your
[28:37.560 --> 28:48.040]  throat you'll understand that the people are so weak you seek after power when it was laying right
[28:48.040 --> 28:54.440]  in front of you the whole time i don't know why the weak are attracted to evil
[28:57.240 --> 29:00.360]  but i tell you this you people have gathered yourselves together in big armies

[30:10.920 --> 30:15.640]  admitted he was politicizing the incident before the body count was even in when he wasn't referring
[30:15.640 --> 30:21.800]  to himself 28 times visibly angry obama called mass shootings in the u.s routine somehow this has
[30:21.800 --> 30:27.160]  become routine obama said my response here this podium has become routine and what becomes routine
[30:27.160 --> 30:31.960]  is the response from those who oppose any sort of gun control legislation hey obama

[33:57.160 --> 34:04.040]  over and over again in the mastermind of the creator and it's in the face of incredible
[34:04.040 --> 34:09.560]  corruption and deceit that i quote the famous statement that i think from an unknown person
[34:09.560 --> 34:15.080]  scribbled it on a wall i know in world war two there are no atheists and foxholes but let's
[34:15.080 --> 34:19.400]  look up the providence of that quote i believe it's attributed to someone who was anonymous
[34:20.840 --> 34:26.520]  and the elite know that there is more in heaven and earth than in all our books and that's why
[34:26.520 --> 34:34.520]  they try to make us i mean psychologists say that animals dogs don't feel joy and don't smile and
[34:34.520 --> 34:41.400]  don't get excited and that we project our emotion onto it and imagine that is absolute total bull
[34:42.280 --> 34:47.480]  your dog will starve to death before it eats you your dog gets excited your dog loves you
[34:47.480 --> 34:52.120]  you can see that in your dog and they tell you that your dog doesn't have free will that your
[34:52.120 --> 34:57.480]  dog is in honorable that your dog doesn't love you because they don't want you to love anything but
[34:57.480 --> 35:03.560]  them they say that women don't love men that men don't love women they say that there is no honor
[35:03.560 --> 35:14.120]  in the world because they want you to give up that's right it is unknown but world war two
[35:15.960 --> 35:21.000]  at bigs are there atheists and foxholes i don't know i've been i wrote a whole piece in college on
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.880]  that uh from that quote you know i've met a lot of atheists when i was deployed and i'm telling you
[35:27.880 --> 35:31.560]  when the bullets start flying the rounds are coming in the artillery is going the rpg's are
[35:31.560 --> 35:37.720]  flying you'll hear every man out there screaming and crying to god shaking asking for forgiveness
[35:37.720 --> 35:43.240]  and then the you know just completely their lives change i saw that time and time again
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.360]  i mean there was one scenario when we were sitting on a mountaintop and these guys are
[35:48.360 --> 35:53.320]  shooting these uh the Taliban shooting at us these huge like you know any aircraft guns towards us
[35:54.360 --> 36:00.920]  and we have to sit here and my back is against a sand berm and i've got about four inches between
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.520]  me and where the bullets are flying and i'm trying to like barely breathe so my chest doesn't expand
[36:06.520 --> 36:10.600]  out and it catch my bulletproof vest and spin me around and then hit me so i'm sitting here and it's
[36:10.600 --> 36:14.760]  a nighttime and you can see the tracers just going by and you're sitting there like oh my god i hope
[36:14.760 --> 36:18.520]  there is a god i hope that something's going on and you'll hear these guys who are always like
[36:18.520 --> 36:23.320]  there's no god there's no god screaming and crying the top of their lungs help me god help me god
[36:23.320 --> 36:28.840]  i'm sorry i'm sorry so yeah i don't think there's any atheists and foxholes
[36:31.480 --> 36:35.320]  this is a true tragedy that happened i actually feel for these people
[36:35.320 --> 36:39.000]  like you do because they were in a victim disarmament zone they were ignorant now they'll
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.560]  be used as a sacrifice to demonize human independence humans right to the fence
[36:43.560 --> 36:49.160]  they'll be used as a burnt offering to sell the further enslavement and domestication of the people
[36:49.160 --> 36:53.640]  by a bunch of cold-blooded vampires and obama we're going to play the clip in a moment
[36:53.640 --> 36:58.760]  about this organ shooting he says oh this is so routine yeah it's routine that they exploit
[36:58.760 --> 37:04.920]  every tragedy when statistically i'm gonna say it again 166 167 people a year die in mass shootings
[37:05.480 --> 37:09.240]  200 plus people die from white tail deer is he going to go out give a speech every time
[37:09.240 --> 37:15.560]  white tail deer kill somebody or honey bees kill 300 yeah that's ridiculous i mean the only thing
[37:15.560 --> 37:19.720]  this routine is the fact that he said he exploits every single thing that he can use to help push
[37:19.720 --> 37:24.360]  his anti-gun agenda they don't want you to be able to protect yourself i mean it was disgusting
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.360]  yesterday we're out there at the campus ut and these people are sitting there screaming giving
[37:28.360 --> 37:33.480]  these sob stories and you know you know we don't need guns on campus you know that's going to cause
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.960]  more drama you're out there because texas is passing a lot let folks be armed on campus explain that
[37:37.960 --> 37:42.280]  to them and then this happens while you're out there covering it yeah so next year in august uh
[37:42.280 --> 37:47.880]  2016 they well they've already passed but it'll go into effect for campus carry so students with
[37:47.880 --> 37:53.080]  chl 21 and up who go and take the class and uh go through all the proper stuff fingerprints and all
[37:53.080 --> 37:58.760]  that they can conceal carry on campus now right now you're able to carry on public sidewalks in the
[37:58.760 --> 38:03.400]  parking garage is all that you could carry long rifles anything like that you want can still carry
[38:03.400 --> 38:07.160]  as well out there like where we're at yesterday protesting there were people carrying guns but
[38:07.160 --> 38:10.840]  they were concealed and you couldn't see them and no one was going you know crazy over that because
[38:10.840 --> 38:14.440]  obviously you're not going to see console and so ut and others with bloomberg are trying to just
[38:14.440 --> 38:19.960]  throw fits and stop it when it just shows their disconnect a criminal a crazy is going to go on
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.440]  there even though oregon was a gunfree zone that's what the criminals the cowards choose well that's
[38:24.440 --> 38:29.400]  what people understand criminals don't follow laws that is why they are criminals so when you put
[38:29.400 --> 38:34.120]  these strict gun laws everywhere all you do is you disarm people to take away their ability to
[38:34.120 --> 38:38.840]  protect themselves and you empower the criminals who want to go out and do bad now yesterday there
[38:38.840 --> 38:44.040]  was a guy uh an armed air force veteran was there he says an air force veteran who had a license
[38:44.040 --> 38:49.240]  to conceal carry was present uh at the school yesterday during the shooting um he said there
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.000]  were a few people on the vet center and then we heard shooting happen we got up and we were going
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.400]  to head out and see what we could do he said at that point in time the faculty immediately told him
[38:57.400 --> 39:02.680]  to stop and held us inside the building essentially they would not let us go and assist now it's a
[39:02.680 --> 39:06.840]  gunfree zone he illegally had the gun in there but he could have saved some lives well i mean i
[39:06.840 --> 39:10.040]  think the guy's great but i would have just ignored those people wouldn't you yeah i would have told
[39:10.040 --> 39:14.120]  him to go screw off i would have just knocked one of them out if i had to if me punch and a teacher
[39:14.120 --> 39:18.040]  is going to save 10 people's lives by all means you're going to get knocked out well you notice
[39:18.040 --> 39:21.480]  i'm not bragging but you don't see a lot of this going on in texas or when they started
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.080]  when the al-qaeda folks show up they just get killed i mean i'm not bragging here i'm not
[39:25.080 --> 39:28.920]  anything special everybody i know my dad anybody else people somebody's killing somebody across the
[39:28.920 --> 39:34.200]  street they're going to charge in what about this vet that got shot seven times who was unarmed uh you
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.800]  know maybe they should have chopped his arms off so he couldn't fight back origan shooting
[39:37.800 --> 39:42.600]  heroic veteran chris mince was shot seven times trying to save people also in my old unit for
[39:42.600 --> 39:47.960]  bragg airborne uh the guy uh got a lot of mutual friends of mine i found that out this morning
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.240]  so uh yeah this guy was shot five times and uh his family released a statement today i got on
[39:53.240 --> 39:57.320]  his facebook and looked said he's okay but he is going to have to learn how to walk again
[39:57.320 --> 40:00.760]  and uh after he was shot five times he was laying on the ground you know they were saying seven it's
[40:00.760 --> 40:04.840]  five yeah five times what i saw in here but yeah he knows they keep mess reporting stuff
[40:05.400 --> 40:09.800]  um he was laying on the ground screaming today's my son's birthday today's my son's birthday
[40:09.800 --> 40:16.920]  and this guy without a gun ran b-line towards this gunman to try to take him out that's the
[40:16.920 --> 40:20.680]  kind of people that are out there that's the kind of guy that you want to conceal carry to have a
[40:20.680 --> 40:24.040]  gun he could have taken that guy out immediately and that's who the globalist hate and says the
[40:24.040 --> 40:28.120]  number one enemy of quote homeland security well then who the hell is homeland security
[40:28.120 --> 40:33.960]  i'll tell you who runs it foreign banks that took over this country how dare them say that the
[40:33.960 --> 40:38.360]  vets are the number one enemy it's because they're criminals and they know vets aren't cowards that's
[40:38.360 --> 40:41.720]  why they hate them then you got this coward chris harper mercer the guy who was a gunman
[40:42.280 --> 40:46.680]  this guy hated christianity he told people in the school to lay down on the ground
[40:47.240 --> 40:51.320]  sprawl out and then he told him one by one to stand up and goes are you a christian if they
[40:51.320 --> 40:56.520]  answered yes boom execute just like colin bun yep execute him right there and if they said no he
[40:56.520 --> 41:00.920]  wounded him shot him in the leg this is a satanic spirit rising up in this country it's out of

[43:39.480 --> 43:43.240]  to be a place where you can debate and discuss things well think about how racist they are
[43:43.800 --> 43:48.040]  that inherently you're a white male but then they'll come up the black males that are libertarian
[43:48.040 --> 43:52.280]  or conservative and say you're a male see there's no getting out of this yeah there's no getting
[43:52.280 --> 43:57.000]  out of this you're bad because you're a male but if you're some emasculated weird little guy in a
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.680]  pink shirt with them going man they're bad man they're bad and the girls will patch you on the
[44:00.680 --> 44:03.800]  head is that woman going to take care of you when you got the flu she's going to take care of when
[44:03.800 --> 44:06.920]  you have a heart attack she's going to take care of you when you're in a freaking nursing home is

[44:12.040 --> 44:17.480]  they've made you alone you're miserable because the state isn't your husband it isn't your wife
[44:17.480 --> 44:23.400]  it won't take care of you it doesn't love you there was this guy out there i don't even know if i can
[44:23.400 --> 44:27.800]  call him a guy he was about as big as a toothpick and he had a little voice like this and he goes
[44:27.800 --> 44:34.920]  so you guys are pro gang this is so horrible i'm pro hillary clinton i'm like elmore and i was like
[44:34.920 --> 44:38.680]  wow i was like have you been castrated you hand your man card over to the gun free ut crowd
[44:38.680 --> 44:43.640]  i was like this guy was the opposite of what any man should be he didn't care he was just a little
[44:43.640 --> 44:51.080]  robot oh i don't like dancing out it's so bad okay yeah let's get rid of some of the other signs
[44:51.080 --> 44:55.080]  why you should be a socialist this is the trash that they got out there yeah that yeah why you
[44:55.080 --> 44:58.920]  should live in a hellhole where people give you whatever you've got it's called being a slave
[44:58.920 --> 45:03.720]  so it's just why you should be a slave that was everywhere that that was a giant sign i was about
[45:03.720 --> 45:09.080]  four foot big i took that picture or maybe you got that one as well but uh that one was out there
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.320]  uh there was another one the whole board where they hang up posters all these socialist clubs
[45:13.320 --> 45:16.680]  how to be a socialist what it means to be a socialist why you should be a socialist how
[45:16.680 --> 45:22.600]  these people it's everywhere at ut it is so liberal there now it is completely it's like
[45:22.600 --> 45:28.040]  its own world within texas is completely unlike everywhere else in texas and they admit they're
[45:28.040 --> 45:32.680]  going to battleground it and just destroy everything well i mean my argument was yesterday
[45:32.680 --> 45:36.440]  was like all right one in five women at the ut campus have a good chance they've either been
[45:36.440 --> 45:40.280]  raped they've been sexually harassed look at this communist sign i was like don't you want
[45:40.280 --> 45:44.760]  women to have the the ability to be able to fight off someone like that some sexual predator
[45:44.760 --> 45:48.840]  wouldn't you want that and i even asked the women i was like yeah isn't it won't female empowerment
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.720]  have women be armed yeah she's like it's just ridiculous we don't need to have them i don't
[45:53.720 --> 45:56.840]  feel comfortable being in the classroom where other people have guns and i don't know their
[45:56.840 --> 46:01.160]  agenda i guarantee you those women didn't have fathers that they are the pro i'm not not people
[46:01.160 --> 46:04.920]  that didn't have a dad i get it some dads are bad but i mean just these are women that didn't
[46:04.920 --> 46:09.720]  have a man around so it's alien to them and the weird thing is these women if they do get men
[46:09.720 --> 46:15.160]  always have the worst guys oh the men that were there were like pop collar polos pink shirts
[46:15.160 --> 46:19.560]  jeans tighter than i mean that's probably why that one guy was talking the way it was i mean
[46:20.200 --> 46:24.680]  little loaves and just kind of skipping around everywhere but they're they're gun-free signs
[46:24.680 --> 46:28.680]  and stuff like we're just here to empower everyone we think we should be armed with reason
[46:29.240 --> 46:33.320]  what are you talking about this is the definition of useful yeah i wonder how many people were
[46:33.320 --> 46:37.000]  armed with reason yesterday in organ how'd that help how'd that work out not too good i want to
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.280]  get to this obama clip uh this obama nation clip this is obama exploiting the tragedy saying nothing
[46:42.280 --> 46:48.120]  about two shootings mass shootings in chicago yesterday saying oh it's so routine there's a hundred
[46:48.120 --> 46:51.720]  and sixty six a hundred and sixty seven hundred and sixty eight it varies it's in the hundred and

[47:16.920 --> 47:22.920]  lunacy so let's go ahead i'm gonna skip this break let's go ahead and go to this clip right now
[47:23.720 --> 47:29.160]  of his lordship yesterday here it is somehow this has become routine hit plus
[47:31.400 --> 47:38.280]  back it up yeah what's routine is 300 plus thousand dead about 80 of them uh on the syrian
[47:38.280 --> 47:44.360]  government side innocent christians non-radical muslims when you put al-qaeda al-nazra isis in there
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  and you've done it in libya you tried to overthrow our allies and did for a year and they blew up
[47:49.000 --> 47:54.200]  almost every church in the country attacked the military bases the government did and crucified
[47:54.200 --> 47:59.400]  people at the government ministry upside down and and anderson cooper of the central intelligence
[47:59.400 --> 48:03.240]  agency i mean people think i just say that no people send emails he really is cia i thought you
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.200]  were joking you know he is cia admittedly this is who runs our cia now is some cowardly little
[48:08.200 --> 48:13.160]  piece of garbage who gets up there and overthrows our allies who had stability and freedom comparatively
[48:13.160 --> 48:18.600]  in egypt to put the muslim brotherhood al-qaeda in charge that's who that is to murder over 50
[48:18.600 --> 48:24.520]  thousand christians in egypt alone our government wants to murder christians just like this dirtbag
[48:24.520 --> 48:28.040]  asking folks of their christian and the christian's credit they would say yes i'm a christian
[48:28.040 --> 48:34.280]  blam that's conviction well frankly that guy's not worth the truth for me i've just lied to him
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.360]  i'm not i'm not denying christ when i get it goes back in the christian deal you know two three
[48:38.360 --> 48:43.080]  times you know for the cock crows you're going to deny deny me i get that but you know i mean it's
[48:43.080 --> 48:47.080]  i mean i lied sneaking to bohemian grove i don't lie on issues that affect people but i mean i'm
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.480]  going to be honest i lie i mean did you ever lie when you were in combat like when you were doing
[48:51.480 --> 48:56.600]  something like with the foreigners oh of course just to keep things calm so stuff doesn't escalate
[48:56.600 --> 49:02.040]  yeah so i mean i'm not defending lies i'm being honest about lying here i don't know why i just
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.840]  digressed off into that i mean i i would never lie about a product i never lie about serious
[49:06.840 --> 49:12.600]  issues never lie about the news i wouldn't lie about an issue but if i'm sneaking onto a military
[49:12.600 --> 49:19.880]  base 15 years ago to videotape delta force training to take out governors when they asked me i mean i
[49:19.880 --> 49:25.800]  had to lie yeah you gotta do she got they still figured it out put a gun to my camera but they caught
[49:25.800 --> 49:30.520]  us but the point i didn't want an instance to just throw us off i'm banned from most bases in texas
[49:31.320 --> 49:35.960]  well the point is let's not be hypocrites i don't know how to digress but so so we've got obama up
[49:35.960 --> 49:44.040]  here lying to everybody in their face about a real issue and it it's just totally insane let's go
[49:44.040 --> 49:57.080]  back to the club somehow this has become routine the reporting is routine my response here at this
[49:57.080 --> 50:06.920]  podium ends up being routine the conversation in the aftermath of it we've become numb to this
[50:06.920 --> 50:14.680]  oh because we know your line pick after columbine and blacksburg after tucson uh after newtown
[50:14.680 --> 50:25.160]  after aurora after charleston it cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict
[50:26.360 --> 50:32.040]  harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun oh no so i think everybody's guns
[50:32.040 --> 50:35.720]  she's got a bunch of prozac anti christian supporters of course is the response of you
[50:35.720 --> 50:40.360]  of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation common sense uses these words
[50:40.360 --> 50:44.840]  like smart meters right now i can imagine the press release is being cranked out
[50:47.960 --> 50:54.440]  we need more guns yes you got guns protection you turn your gun safety loss yes
[50:56.680 --> 51:00.200]  if everyone has a gun instead of those and shoot something back in five seconds exactly
[51:00.200 --> 51:04.040]  what do you people are going to get killed they hate it guns are getting more popular abortions
[51:04.040 --> 51:09.320]  getting unpopular uh 69 percent of hispanics don't want open borders they always go if you're
[51:09.320 --> 51:16.920]  hispanic open borders why so whether you're from japan china mexico india anybody can just come
[51:16.920 --> 51:20.520]  here we got to pay for them people aren't stupid yeah and i don't even believe gallup it's like
[51:20.520 --> 51:24.520]  85 percent of the mexicans i know don't want open borders because they're americans yeah like i'll
[51:24.520 --> 51:30.600]  say i'm german and english yeah i mean what i'm saying is joe they're losing the battle they know
[51:30.600 --> 51:36.040]  they're losing what do you say about what he's saying and i think it's bs i mean his his response
[51:36.040 --> 51:40.040]  is routine the fact that he wants to take away your right to protect yourself every time there's
[51:40.040 --> 51:46.120]  something happened he jumps on it like a dog and just starts he just attacks it all right let's use
[51:46.120 --> 51:50.440]  this to push our anti-gun agenda let's push it let's push it let's push it know what we should
[51:50.440 --> 51:55.640]  be doing is arming people so they have the ability to take that guy out quicker well obviously he knows
[51:55.640 --> 52:00.600]  that he wants to disarm us joe the the leader of the free world no longer they now say rush rush is
[52:00.600 --> 52:04.600]  the leader of the free world because of him and the globalists and then they and their failure
[52:04.600 --> 52:10.040]  he's saying you are the number one terror threat in america and i guess if america's foreign globalist
[52:10.040 --> 52:15.000]  that want to enslave us i guess you are number one threat yeah i guess how does it feel when you

[53:46.040 --> 53:49.960]  now i mean i thought that was going to happen to me i got scared both these guys i talked to were
[53:49.960 --> 53:54.840]  former special forces living on the streets in austin yeah the last year when i knew i was getting
[53:54.840 --> 53:58.840]  out for my injury i started going through panic attacks i started going through depression all
[53:58.840 --> 54:01.960]  that because i was like i don't know what i'm going to do my mom's telling me the economy's
[54:01.960 --> 54:06.920]  collapse and all this i was deployed saying the gas prices were through the roof 2008 yeah 2008

[54:13.720 --> 54:17.880]  better for me to stay in afghanistan that it would to be to come back here and face what's going on
[54:17.880 --> 54:21.240]  in this country because like you said all my friends started getting out and i started hearing
[54:21.240 --> 54:27.240]  these stories i was quite frankly scared to be a civilian because i knew i wasn't gonna get taken
[54:27.240 --> 54:32.360]  care of i was going to be just thrown at the curb and and not even paid attention to my buddies
[54:32.360 --> 54:36.520]  were telling me that they were spending months and months trying to get help at the va trying to
[54:36.520 --> 54:40.440]  be seen trying to be heard nothing happens they would get another doctor and they'd have to go
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.120]  through the whole process again or they'd miss an appointment and then the va kicked them out of
[54:44.120 --> 54:48.760]  the system and then you had to go back and re enter all that stuff go out of these globalists

[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:54.520]  you were forged by your god to be weak i wasn't made that way
[1:03:56.120 --> 1:04:02.040]  and and as weak as i am because believe me i'm only flesh and blood i am transcendent compared
[1:04:02.040 --> 1:04:06.280]  to you people i've already won thank jesus christ for that one
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:17.160]  one of the devil's biggest tricks is selling the idea that satanism gives you free will
[1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:24.840]  and empowerment no it doesn't christ gives you power christ gives you will christ gives you strength
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:30.840]  and the churches on purpose sell this image of an incredibly weak christ figure so that you
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:38.760]  don't understand the power that it took to lay down to all that weakness and that patheticness
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:49.240]  to a bunch of bugs that was strength that was honor that was will and to take on at the same time
[1:04:49.240 --> 1:04:54.280]  all of our weakness and then to transcend it that's the great animating contest
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:59.640]  and we're only a shadow and expression of that same journey
[1:05:24.280 --> 1:05:28.760]  see what we could do immediately the school staff stopped us and told us to get inside of the building
[1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:33.240]  essentially the staff wouldn't let us go to assist one courageous man who also tried to

[1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:43.480]  in asserting his right to conceal carry parker was no only violating a rule which declared the

[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:04.040]  breakaway civilization and using the super advanced technologies to basically build
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:10.680]  back doors into all of the culture and society to create a brain trust that did not deploy that
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:16.680]  knowledge to the general public but kept it to itself as a way to gain total hegemonic power
[1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:24.920]  i haven't read this book yet i've just got it a few days ago scanned over at this morning
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:28.520]  looked at some of the pictures read the synopsis read the reviews i've read some of the articles
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:36.360]  about it and let me tell you this weekend when i go to the local pool of my kids
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:40.360]  i'm going to be trying to sneak in an hour or so while they're swimming and fighting with each
[1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:48.920]  other or whatever over floats fighting friendly trying to read this because it's important
[1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:53.000]  and you know this show we get into all this we research that we think we know it all you read
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.080]  it all together because i've already started reading it it's just you learn a lot from it
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:02.760]  because this is the real world you mean you think secret government programs ended with
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:06.920]  a manhattan project in the abomb i will assure you that was just the beginning of the shadow
[1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:10.920]  government and the national security acts and the rest of it i'll never forget it was in the
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:18.280]  baltimore sun i've talked about this many times like 18 years ago and they talked about DARPA
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:23.800]  practicing just testing in major cities through cell towers putting out calming waves for the
[1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:28.200]  public now usually it's schizophrenics that have had heavy metal toxification that they're not
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:33.000]  actually under cell phone tower control but i'd always heard that from people and then they're
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.920]  always reading in the paper and i'm like what is this is this something to condition me to get
[1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:43.080]  me ready for this so how deep does the rabbit hole really go we're not selling this book i
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:49.640]  but it is a great pitch i'm giving it the pentagon's brain and uncensored history of DARPA
[1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:55.960]  america's top secret military research agency annie Jacobson author of the new york timesbest
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:11:01.800]  seller area 51 an operation paperclip you know i knew about operation paperclip and i'm gonna go
[1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:09.640]  to our guest when i was about six or seven of my grandfather would be sitting there around his
[1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:16.840]  round kitchen table talking about reentry devices and merv technology and space bases and verner
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:21.880]  von braun and all the rest of it and he would talk about damn nazis because he was you know in
[1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:29.240]  world war two a pilot and how he would in texas go to these military bases uh when he was doing
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:36.120]  work for DARPA i've never been told all of them it was it was basically crowd control robots and
[1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:41.320]  stuff it was secret and he and he would just talk about how much he hated nazis because he got out
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:45.960]  of whatever it was because it was nazis that he would run into and i remember sitting around
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:49.960]  of my my mom would be like he's a little eccentric my dad would be like no he's not eccentric your
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:53.880]  grandfather's really smart but imagine you're six seven years old talking about nazis at us military
[1:11:53.880 --> 1:12:02.600]  bases believe me it uh it'll get your attention but that said let's now move on to our guest the
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:08.360]  pentagon's brain annie Jacobson thank you so much for joining us congratulations on your new book
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:12.680]  oh wow where does this start i mean where should we go talking about something as big as DARPA
[1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:18.840]  well thank you so much for having me and i loved that intro fascinating about the nazis so how
[1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:23.240]  about we start right there how about i tell you a fascinating story about nazis and DARPA
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:28.920]  let's do it um okay so the way i got interested in this book in the first place i was finishing up
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:34.760]  my operation paperclip nazi scientist book and i learned that the first that there was a new
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:40.040]  agent i was wondering what von brown was doing in the 50s after he had kind of settled in and
[1:12:40.040 --> 1:12:46.200]  was building rockets for the government and i learned that he was the first choice in 1958 for
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:52.280]  this brand new agency at the pentagon called was then called DARPA now we know it is DARPA
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:59.160]  and von brown is nothing if not ambitious so he says to the pentagon well i will come and be your
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:05.160]  chief scientist of all your research military research agency however i i need to bring 12 of
[1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:10.600]  my fellow nazis with me and that was the line in the sand for the pentagon they thought we can deal
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:15.560]  with one but not all 12 of them right here at the at the beating heart of the pentagon and so
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:23.480]  instead herb york became the director wow and then they spun off and sent him over to nasa i guess
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:28.520]  and then he brought in godard and everybody else yes yes but here's another little nazi link you
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:34.120]  might enjoy which is that you know you spoke of the of the military industrial complex you've run
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:41.240]  eisenhower's speech so specifically herb york that chief scientist of DARPA first chief scientist
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:47.240]  wanted to know he was troubled he said in his memoirs to whom eisenhower was referring
[1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:53.400]  specifically so when eisenhower retired herb york went to go see him at eisenhower's home
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:59.480]  here in the california desert and got him to say who specifically it was he was afraid of
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:06.840]  and the two people he named were edward teller father of the hydrogen bomb and warner von brown
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:14.680]  wow so much of our world has been shaped by these people uh it's it's just mind boggling
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:18.200]  that's why i can't wait to read your book i'm greedily looking at it like it's a big a big
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:23.240]  cake i want to carve into uh accelerating into what got a lot of news you were talking about DARPA
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:30.680]  and brain chips and troops tell us about that yes so so much of this book i wrote is really
[1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:37.640]  about man and machine man's relationship with machines as we came out of world war two technology
[1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:44.120]  just takes off and when you get to the end of the book you learn about this new future idea
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:49.240]  which is actually very much part of the present but is accelerating us into the future which is
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:57.800]  the pentagon specifically DARPA's plan to couple man and machine so that science fiction idea of
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:05.240]  cyborg is now becoming a reality at the pentagon and by the way this is all dogma these are you
[1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:12.840]  know i pull quotes out of pentagon unclassified reports that talk about we must accelerate
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:19.880]  our artificially intelligent weapon system we must take advantage of this new brain technology
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:25.720]  the pentagon calls it neuro prosthetics but met you know you or i might call it brain chips and
[1:15:25.720 --> 1:15:31.640]  those are the plans to begin these and they are beginning these clinical trials where
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:37.080]  soldiers who have come back from iraq and afghanistan uh with cognitive impairment they're
[1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:43.240]  called brain wounded warriors by the pentagon there's 300 000 of them who came home from those
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:48.120]  wars and in the clinical trials where they are now they're putting these brain chips into the
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:56.440]  soft tissue of the brain um to restore cognitive functioning that's the plan but what i also found
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:03.320]  in interviewing for example the jason scientist um that met the pentagon is being advised this is
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:09.240]  not a good idea and this is a direct quote because it could lead to high quality brain control
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:18.440]  wow direct quote that is not annie jacobston idea about what might happen that's the jason
[1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:25.640]  scientist who by the way um have been advising darpa since 1960 i interviewed mirf goldberger
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:30.840]  for the book he was the co-founder of the jason scientist and he just died but he shared with me
[1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:37.160]  a lot of fascinating information about you know advising darpa about what weapon systems to design
[1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:43.000]  over the decade and then there were other futures depending on like marshall and others i want to
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:48.680]  try to walk through some of those but my issue with it is it's like voltswagen putting cheating
[1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:54.040]  software on their emissions testing the problem is my uncle was in a motorcycle accident he has
[1:16:54.040 --> 1:16:59.480]  epilepsy from it they they they gave him a brain chip and a stimulator it's really helped his
[1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:03.960]  quality of life i'm all for it i'm not against technology the problem is these companies and
[1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:10.360]  corporations always want to piggyback something into it and it's so complex that how do you stop
[1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:17.400]  trojan horses or how do you stop hacks once we start taking brain chips well absolutely and this
[1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:24.200]  is the heart of the matter it's the double-edged sword of these military systems that darpa creates
[1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:30.440]  yes there are these amazing benefits that make their way into the population like the internet uncle
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:37.720]  yes and also like your uncle brain chip i mean every every side has two sides in essence but
[1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:43.160]  here's the thing is that that which keeps you safe can also harm you and so for me just as a
[1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:48.760]  journalist i mean my job is to inform the public and so it's like and i love that you play eyes
[1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:54.440]  in our speech because he says in that second part of his military industrial complex speech you know
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:18:01.880]  these two ideas can live together you can have a very strong military you can have a necessary
[1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:08.920]  national defense but it must be in balance with what he calls an alert and knowledgeable citizenry
[1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:16.120]  and there's the rub that's why people uh will it be who's them to know about these programs these
[1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:22.040]  are not you know things of science fiction novels look the darpa director said just the other day
[1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:29.400]  at the aspen conference everything is science fiction until it becomes real it is everything
[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:36.680]  is magic until it becomes real yes and and the thing is that darpa because their job is to create
[1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:43.480]  revolution in military affairs think about that word i mean a revolution is not a revolution
[1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:50.520]  if there's not an element of surprise and so darpa is working on weapon systems 20 25 years out they
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:56.440]  invented stealth i mean they didn't invent it but their scientists created stealth and then when stealth
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:04.120]  was unveiled um during the goal four you know it took the enemy by surprise so what's the what is
[1:19:04.120 --> 1:19:10.360]  darpa doing now and when i show you in the book what darpa is doing that's unclassified that i
[1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:16.120]  was able to report on from interviewing scientists you get to decide for yourself okay so what is
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:22.200]  really going on well i can't wait to read the book i'm going to come back from break i i want to
[1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:25.720]  just talk about what you think are some of the most important parts of the book it is a big book
[1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:30.680]  a lot of photos a lot of diagrams a lot of information and you know for me this is the real
[1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:35.800]  world people talk about sports icons hollywood it's all really boring when you realize that what we
[1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:45.000]  see with darpa is only the tip of the iceberg of a giant submerged shadow technological system
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:50.120]  and as you said the stealth technology was 25 30 years old uh when they rolled it out in
[1:19:51.880 --> 1:19:58.680]  you know 1987 1988 it's just amazing we'll be back stay with us inside the pentagon's brain

[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:25.480]  soon after it was also announced that credit cards debit cards us passports hotel room keys and even
[1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:30.760]  transit passes would all soon incorporate rfid it was then i formed id stronghold to share my

[1:24:23.400 --> 1:24:29.320]  uncensored history of darpa america's top secret military research agency annie jacobson is our
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:36.840]  guest and general posner author of god's bankers said annie jacobson's considerable talents as an
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:42.760]  investigative journalist prove indispensable in uncovering the remarkable history of one of america's
[1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:48.920]  most powerful and clandestine military research agencies and she is a great storyteller making
[1:24:48.920 --> 1:24:53.640]  the tantalizing tale of pentagon's brain from the depths of the cold war of the present day
[1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:58.040]  come alive on every page you know you've been nice and then kind of let me leave the interview at
[1:24:58.040 --> 1:25:05.320]  first but you're the expert on this and obviously the expert on your book it you heard my point going
[1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:10.840]  into break i mean this is a shadow government it did basically become what isanhower warned about
[1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:17.080]  to a certain extent and i think that adds the arrogance of washington because imagine what
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:22.760]  they've got they're not telling us about but at a certain point uh still it's just humans that are
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:29.560]  running this whole thing yes shall i tell you about uh one of the spooky programs yes please
[1:25:30.360 --> 1:25:35.640]  okay so we were talking about coupling man and machine that's the goal for the future but darpa
[1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:43.240]  is already able to create what they call biohybrid that is their actual term for it and it's actually
[1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:52.200]  it's like a part animal part machine and this is now 12 13 years old this program six the success
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:26:01.960]  of it so back in 2002 they had their first public success um darpa scientists wired up a rat brain
[1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:08.040]  these were like with tiny wires the size of human hairs connected to electrodes and also connected
[1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:16.520]  to a microprocessor that was sewn into the rat back like a backpack then from 500 meters away
[1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:24.280]  the scientists remotely controlled this rat through a maze okay and this process has been
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:30.520]  ongoing of coupling more animals with machines and just last year darpa scientists did the same thing
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:38.600]  with a moth so they inserted the electrodes these neuro prosthetics into the moth when it was in its
[1:26:38.600 --> 1:26:45.000]  pupa stage so think that through it's like this incredible analogy of metamorphosis so they put
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:50.680]  the electrodes in the pupa stage the worm stage and then the moth you know the wings blossom in
[1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:58.360]  essence and now the brain chips the body chip is part of the animal and the darpa scientists were
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:06.680]  able to steer this mandica sexta moth that same way the moth only has a a life cycle of 90 days
[1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:12.840]  so it was like a short experiment but you can see this movement toward being able to control
[1:27:14.120 --> 1:27:17.720]  humans in this same manner absolutely it's the end of free will
[1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:24.040]  you know if you sign up for it i mean and i think that's the rub i think that there's
[1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:32.520]  a lot to be said about being aware of how these military applications you know are or not are
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:37.960]  not appropriate the government calls it um the super the super soldier program i mean that's what
[1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:46.280]  it is giving warfighters enhanced cognition enhanced physiology so we all know there's
[1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:50.360]  governors lifting weights or marching they can just flip a switch you can march 100 miles
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:57.720]  or you can wear the super suit which by the way darpa has teamed up with special forces now
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:03.560]  to create this palo super suit i mean it has it you know it does everything it even has
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:10.360]  like blood hemorrhage control mechanisms inside of it god but you have to ask yourself
[1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:17.000]  what it where it's really going toward is a concept called transhumanism this idea and
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:23.480]  people who are pro transhumanism believe that it's actually a good idea that why not why
[1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:29.240]  shouldn't man with all his intelligence all his technology all his science be able to kind of
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:35.240]  control his own evolution by merging himself with machine but of course many other people
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:41.640]  think this is a really bad idea well i'm not against it in general but the elite we have
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:45.800]  basically sheet depth eugenics as you know at the end of world war two because Hitler gave it a bad
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:51.240]  name and turned it into transhumanism i think transhumanists are all eugenicists but that's
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:58.200]  what it came from oldest huxley's brother julian huxley at the un wrote papers admitting all this
[1:28:58.200 --> 1:29:02.120]  so my problem is there a lot of the elite want to use this for population control
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:08.760]  not to empower people and so i don't see us being given a choice as rake herswell says well you may
[1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:16.200]  not be augmented but you'll be like a bug basically i mean look this is definitely something worth
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:21.880]  discussing i think that's the whole point is that you know just to kind of like ignore it all is a
[1:29:21.880 --> 1:29:27.960]  bit like putting your head in the sand like an off just ostrich and leaving your neck exposed i mean
[1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:34.600]  you want you people want to be aware of of what is going on and then any gegerson stay there
[1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:38.600]  instead we gotta go to break absolutely let's come back and discuss that and walk through it because
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:43.880]  we're talking about the whole future of the world here any gegerson dot com is her website
[1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:51.000]  i'm alex jones with info wars dot com we're talking about reality we're on the march the empires on
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:30:02.200]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network selective outrage obama hasn't said a damn word
[1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:07.080]  about routine mass shootings in chicago following the mass shooting in organ thursday the president
[1:30:07.080 --> 1:30:11.560]  delivered a 12 minute tie raid about the need for stricter gun control laws it admitted he was
[1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:16.040]  politicizing the incident before the body count was even in when he wasn't referring to himself
[1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:22.360]  28 times visibly angry obama called mass shootings in the u.s routine somehow this has become routine
[1:30:22.360 --> 1:30:27.800]  obama said my response here this podium has become routine and what becomes routine is the response
[1:30:27.800 --> 1:30:33.320]  from those who oppose any sort of gun control legislation hey obama leave the guns alone
[1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:38.920]  stop trying to disarm people who are law-abiding citizens who want to protect themselves their
[1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:44.760]  family their property that is the right we don't need a gun law our law is a second amendment
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:51.720]  you keep attacking people day in and day out and quite frankly i'm sick of it this is on you

[1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:24.120]  your thoughts i've thought about this probably more deeply than any other subject because it is
[1:33:24.120 --> 1:33:29.880]  the subject your eyes your shadow government shadow technologies super technologies super
[1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:36.440]  science it was science fiction is now reality here and just from my own family experiences with my
[1:33:36.440 --> 1:33:42.520]  grandfather and then some other members of the family i know there are huge secret government
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:50.360]  programs going on that are way more 20 30 40 50 years in advance depending on the science
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:57.240]  of what we even know about and we understand that from television and and so many of these
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:02.760]  other technologies it's dumbing us down our physical IQ is dropping that so so that's that's
[1:34:02.760 --> 1:34:10.600]  that's not just that's not just the the the nurture it's it's the nature as well humanity
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:17.880]  is falling apart in many respects and so the answers to our future could be in the technology
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:23.080]  the problem is elites are very predatory on average historically and they're using it to control
[1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:32.440]  and everything they're doing is about ending free will and making us take what the government
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:38.200]  wants into our bodies ie vaccines back like we're against vaccine technology because we're just
[1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:43.320]  ignorant hillbillies know we know about all the recalls the problems the additives the immunity
[1:34:43.320 --> 1:34:47.560]  of the vaccine makers the fact they want to make a hundred and something vaccines mandatory
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:53.560]  we know it's linked to major problems and then they just sell this thing of it's science take it
[1:34:53.560 --> 1:34:58.680]  and gmo it's science eat it oh really i got all these studies shut up and take it you know glyphosate
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:02.680]  never hurt anybody you can drink it okay lobbyist drink it i'm gonna drink that
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:10.920]  so that's my problem is so many of these corporate leaders are delusional
[1:35:11.800 --> 1:35:16.840]  they're on power trips they're narcissistic and who wouldn't be with billions of dollars
[1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:22.280]  and helicopters and all the power you want and hey i get a manhattan project to live forever
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:27.400]  that's really what this is the manhattan project for eternal life they're just using the pentagon
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:35.480]  in all of these operations as the focused compartmentalized template to siphon off the goodies
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:41.880]  and what happens when they do achieve artificial intelligence they may have already done it
[1:35:42.520 --> 1:35:46.120]  what happens when they do achieve for all intents and purposes eternal life
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:51.240]  then the future doesn't need us anymore the seven and a half billion people on this planet
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:55.880]  and when i talk to the top tech people when i talk to the billionaires the ones that'll talk to me
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:36:00.600]  they say yo you're right uh when i go to these big meetings and i go to these big events
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:05.240]  i've talked to folks that have been to boulderberg they go we discuss why haven't we just released
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:10.120]  a bio weapon and wiped everybody out because you know the profane public doesn't deserve all this
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:16.920]  only us the you know these ascended gods deserve it so that's being discussed you need to understand
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:23.320]  that now that's a pretty heavy talk annie jakemson is our guest annie jakemson.com the new book the
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:28.600]  pentagon's brain so i've set the table now and i'm going to try to give you the floor to really
[1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:35.000]  walk through all this i've laid out my fears my concerns where this is going the elite already
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:38.680]  kind of act like they've had some major breakthroughs and we don't exist anymore
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:42.760]  they don't even really care their propaganda doesn't work anymore so and i'm seeing a lot of digging
[1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:48.440]  in a lot of bunkers being built a lot of elites running off that find out about this to armored
[1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:55.080]  redoubts in new zealand i talked about this a decade ago it's now in the news whatever the
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:37:00.600]  billionaires whatever the top technicians that are given entry into this are being told
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:06.600]  makes them cry so kind of a heavy interview annie but where do you want to go with that
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:14.360]  well let's talk about fear for a moment and narrative because you know you and i are in
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:19.160]  the same business in essence i i mean i'm informed the public and so do you that's the job of the
[1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:28.120]  journalist okay so what i found really just at the edge of sinister um trying to maintain
[1:37:28.120 --> 1:37:35.560]  objectivity i find that word okay so because the DARPA now has a program that has to do with trust
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:43.560]  and it seems to have been born out of this idea that at the pentagon as the pentagon is moving
[1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:48.840]  toward autonomous robots toward hunter killer robots as we've been talking about merging man
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:54.120]  and machine merging animal and machine getting an army of drones on the battlefield that are part
[1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:59.960]  and parcel man machine um there's been pushback inside the pentagon these are documents i refer
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:04.840]  to in the book where people from the military commanders to the drone operators say this is a
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:11.720]  bad idea they mistrust the idea of coupling man and machine these yeah we need to build a world
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:17.880]  for humans and not just give ourselves over to it until we know it it works properly yes and these
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:22.680]  are actually individuals inside the military establishment saying you know the probability
[1:38:22.680 --> 1:38:28.040]  and consequences of failure are too great we don't want to go there and so what does the defense
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:33.080]  science board so you talk about the elite i'll tell you the defense science board is a group of
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:40.680]  elite advisors in the pentagon that very few people have heard of dsb and they advise both the
[1:38:40.680 --> 1:38:47.720]  president and they advise the pentagon and the dsb looks at this idea uh about mistrusting robots and
[1:38:47.720 --> 1:38:55.400]  they say this attitude must change we must have a word they call unambiguously for the rapid
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:39:00.520]  acceleration and the development of these ai weapon systems okay hold that thought separate
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:08.040]  from that right around the same time darpa teams up with iarpa which is the cia darpa
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:13.320]  just stands for intelligent advanced research project agency and they begin a program
[1:39:13.320 --> 1:39:18.040]  and this is where i talk to you about fear and about narration narratives it's called narrative
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:24.760]  networks and two and they're looking at how to develop techniques this is language from them
[1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:31.480]  to call to look at the effects of narrative on human cognition to look at the effects of
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:36.280]  how people can be influenced but specifically they're looking at it through chemical means
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:42.920]  and this is what i found sinister there's a chemical in the brain called oxytocin
[1:39:43.560 --> 1:39:48.840]  and it's often called the moral molecule it's released i'll give you an example when a mother
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:54.520]  is breastfeeding oxytocin is released that's that ultimate bond of trust between mother
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:40:02.760]  and breastfeeding child okay oxytocin well darpa has a program to look at our oxytocin and see
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:09.880]  how it can be used in terms of trust separate from that a researcher in germany told scientific
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:18.200]  american recently that she did a study um injecting oxytocin in the nose of 64 men to see if she could
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:24.200]  erase fear and she said that's exactly what happened so you have to ask yourself what is
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:31.720]  going on with this idea of getting rid of fear well i've got the answer to darpa if you just
[1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:36.520]  get your life together and get a purpose-driven life to stand up for honor and good people
[1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:41.000]  i can dose myself immediately and i have no fear knowing i'm doing it for children i mean
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.520]  that's why they always say it's for the children it's for the children they know with psych warfare
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:48.840]  terms how to get us to release that at least people that are moral and manipulate us so
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:54.360]  this is this is so advanced there's obviously chemical warfare going on through so many of the
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:58.200]  additives i know you're an investigative journalist you don't go off into that but i can pull articles
[1:40:58.200 --> 1:41:03.000]  up and show you right now you're highly informed undoubtedly everything we're being told about is
[1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:09.240]  super ancient uh in in in modern terms you know 10 years ago was ancient i remember seeing
[1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:16.520]  science papers when i was a kid uh you know laying around the house of like roaches that had
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:22.920]  silicon microchips they could control so so darpa talks about robo rat being 12 years old
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:29.320]  that's their rollout of robo rat yes yes yes yes you're absolutely right i mean you're talking
[1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:36.040]  what is going on 10 25 years down the road we find out you know or rather we find out now what
[1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:42.120]  has been going on look at drones drones i learned in researching my book on darpa here that drones
[1:41:42.120 --> 1:41:47.560]  first made an appearance on the battlefield are you ready for this in vietnam and yet you know in
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:53.720]  1968 there were these two drone systems called night panther and night gazelle okay and yet
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:42:00.760]  most people think drones made an appearance on the battlefield in afghanistan in 2002 i know my
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:07.080]  grandfather my grandfather sold it and then it was classified but he sold a crowd control robot
[1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:12.680]  that he developed uh at fort hood to the pentagon in like the 70s
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:19.080]  um that was part of the non lethal weapons program that was yes crowd control that was
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:24.920]  born out of you know what are we going to do about these vietnam protesters absolutely and
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:29.960]  then vietnam ended so they didn't they didn't buy them but but those non lethal weapons have
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:34.920]  continued those really have a lot to do with crowd control and they um they were you know
[1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:41.000]  where they were developed many of the laboratories were actually in saigon during the war in thailand
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:47.640]  during the war because it was much easier to keep them far away from the public and disguise them as
[1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:53.320]  if they were being used um you know against you know the vietnam and vietnam when in fact
[1:42:53.320 --> 1:43:00.440]  as i report in the book they were actually being designed for use back home i covered a story about
[1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:06.600]  16 17 years ago uh the sunshine project out of ut a professor and this was one of the only times we
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:10.920]  actually got visited and and then the and then they agreed to reclassify and they shut down the
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:18.200]  sunshine project but this was drones to be used to deploy chemicals for crowd control uh across
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:24.200]  the united states did you ever run anything like that well i didn't run in that's interesting
[1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:29.400]  drones dropping chemicals i mean i i learned about them the DARPA programs that had to do
[1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:35.960]  with kind of like shooting them out of cannons um or conventional weapons but obviously helicopter
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:43.240]  pilots might say no to spray a hallucinogen on austin texas or an opiate knockout gas the problem
[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:47.160]  is it causes a lot of fatalities as a car wrecks and fires and stuff like that that's why they
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:51.960]  call it unethical they keep it classified but they declassified this and then they reclassified it
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:59.640]  and uh and and it was they were so threatening to us that i just said fine i'd covered it then
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:06.280]  they went and shut down the ut project and then DARPA left it on the archive of google you can
[1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:12.760]  actually look it up they didn't have google i guess refused to remove it i i don't know wow yes that
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:17.560]  way back machine i found some stuff that way that is interesting i mean and and how ironic that the
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:24.200]  internet used to be called the arpanet yes because it is a DARPA invention yes well i just don't get
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:27.880]  why they'd have ut shut it down on the sunshine project shut it down and have us shut it down
[1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:32.600]  and then they just left it on google well they might not be able to get rid of it i mean that is
[1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:36.920]  what is interesting you know there are little stories about that all the time about researchers
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:41.960]  finding documents and say the national archives i write about one of them this giant program for
[1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:48.040]  the apocalypse um it was called the doomsday project and you know a researcher uncovers it
[1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:55.000]  makes it public then the department of defense steps in reclassifies it but it's still out there
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:59.320]  as it should be and so there's really nothing that the government can do about it at that point
[1:44:59.320 --> 1:45:03.480]  once it's on the internet as a pdf file or as part of the way back machine
[1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:10.120]  what about i've read your book yet i'm reading this weekend as i said the folks just tuned in
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:14.600]  we're talking to the pentagon's brain author annie jackson what about other governments
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:21.240]  and and and their darpas are their arpas uh what's your expert take on that well again there's
[1:45:21.240 --> 1:45:28.040]  where you have to really acknowledge that darpa is a major force and it's major it's a major
[1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:32.280]  significant force for americans for national security i mean you must give credit where credit
[1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:39.720]  is due the agency was created when the russians beat us into space with spotnick and in all these
[1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:45.720]  decades since darpa has done its job we've never been taken by technological surprise and you can
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:53.400]  be sure that there is a goal by other enemy nations be it russia or china or even a dark
[1:45:53.400 --> 1:45:59.240]  course like saudi arabia i've been told to try to break one of these major barriers artificial
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:05.960]  intelligence cloning to embarrass the united states and you know kind of score that propaganda coup
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:13.080]  the uh russia has its own darpa and in a couple statements its defense minister has actually
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:18.680]  said you know something along the lines of our darpa is better than your darpa there's this
[1:46:18.680 --> 1:46:24.040]  sinister menace the idea that you know one day they're going to come out with their revolution
[1:46:24.040 --> 1:46:31.240]  and technology well i tell you america has been exceptional in many ways putin says you're not
[1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:35.800]  exceptional we've been exceptionally decadent exceptionally had other problems also a lot
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:42.280]  of exceptional things in a good way and uh there's no way to doubt that america's free market system
[1:46:42.280 --> 1:46:48.520]  coupled with uh corporate and government coordination has led the new renaissance
[1:46:49.160 --> 1:46:53.720]  but there's just such an attitude of statistin people to not deploy that renaissance to the people
[1:46:54.760 --> 1:46:59.080]  and i think that's darpa's biggest failure they did deploy the internet now they wish
[1:46:59.080 --> 1:47:03.240]  according to j rockefeller and others they never would have uh so i guess maybe that's why they're
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:09.720]  scared is that they don't want to give promethean fire to the public uh huh well you know that's
[1:47:09.720 --> 1:47:13.880]  an interesting point you making look at gps technology okay researching this book i was
[1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:20.280]  really surprised to learn that gps technology goes back to darpa's first year in 1958 when they put
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:25.160]  satellites up so it was originally targeting technology i mean think about it of course it was
[1:47:25.160 --> 1:47:31.640]  artillery right yes it was like once laser guided bombs made an appearance in the end of the vietnam
[1:47:31.640 --> 1:47:38.440]  war now you could have this gps coordinates but you say how did it get into the public so the story
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:45.160]  goes like this you know um it's secret it was actually very easy to hack into believe it or not
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:50.280]  and so the military created a feature called selective availability and it was essentially an
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:56.520]  offset by several hundred feet so if somebody hacked into the military's gps system to drop a
[1:47:56.520 --> 1:48:01.000]  bomb in essence or target something they would be off by a couple hundred feet well during the
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:07.400]  clinton administration word came in that europe was going to develop you know sort of copy
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:14.440]  the american military gps and make the system public and obviously have a huge industry around it
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:22.120]  and so clinton declassified darpa's gps program got rid of the essay feature that offset feature
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:29.320]  and made it public and now the benefits of that are in you know the american system uh the monetary
[1:48:29.320 --> 1:48:34.120]  system look at google but they only do it when somebody else is going to innovate they have to
[1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:38.200]  that's why we need to keep national sovereignty and not have a global government i believe a
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:41.880]  global government will be the beginning of the new dark age because there'll be no incentive to
[1:48:41.880 --> 1:48:47.720]  innovate and of course that goes right along with my idea which is just educate the people i mean
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:53.560]  just know what is going on be alert and knowledgeable people often think that they you know well what
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:59.000]  is that what does that do i mean you and i both know from being in the business of information
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:04.600]  that you know what you look at what you read your eyeballs what you put all of that gets paid
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:13.400]  attention to and it all matters and it all has an an effect and i believe absolutely to my core
[1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:18.360]  that you know you talk about human augmentation well you can augment yourself just essentially
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:24.440]  by learning you really don't need a ship exactly we become what we ingest what we look at and
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:29.320]  uh i know it keeps the public busy to have and watch football all day but man these people are
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:34.040]  stupid and i mean i get folks like football i played football but that's not men i talk to
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:39.400]  that's all they talk about that it's just it's bizarre i didn't grow up around that and you
[1:49:39.400 --> 1:49:44.200]  know in hell my grandfather played you know football with with you know folks like uh
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:48.360]  tom landry at ut i'm not against football and i played football my dad played football
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:54.120]  mom you know it's just it's so weird where that's our culture when american culture really was about
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:59.960]  inventions trailblazing exploration and so i have a love hate relationship with darpa because it seems
[1:49:59.960 --> 1:50:08.040]  so americana so good so innovative so wonderful but then it's got a dark side well you know
[1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:14.360]  don't get me wrong i interviewed 75 scientists and engineers uniquely affiliated with darpa
[1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:22.760]  programs going back to the agency's beginning and almost the 100 majority rave about darpa
[1:50:22.760 --> 1:50:29.240]  for this very american ideal of excellence that they say all these scientists they look darpa
[1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:35.320]  gave me money let me give you an example there's a limb regeneration lab yes i said that correctly
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:42.520]  a limb regeneration lab here at uc uh irvine where scientists are working because they believe
[1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:48.600]  25 30 years out humans will be able to regrow their limbs if they can do the research and stay
[1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:52.280]  there final segment riveting i want to come back with with some of the incredible things

[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:26.600]  four to six p.m. with the sunday transmission but a whole other hour is coming up i'm meant to go
[1:56:26.600 --> 1:56:30.200]  to calls i'm meant to give the number out i just hogged the time with our guest and did and so
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:34.680]  i apologize we'll open phones up with shift uh in the next hour with your economic comments or
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:41.400]  questions at 800-259-9231 well annie i'm impressed with your book that i've read so far you know
[1:56:41.400 --> 1:56:45.480]  just 30 pages or so i'm impressed with you want to read your other books we got about three minutes
[1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:49.960]  left in closing uh what are some of the other big advances that are coming out of DARPA i mean
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:56.040]  people talk about nasa and all these inventions isn't it most of it DARPA most of it is DARPA i
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:57:01.400]  mean DARPA for example has a robot that that will go to mars it's called balkyrie and nasa
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:08.360]  just designed it for DARPA challenge but um it's going to go to mars and act like an avatar so it'll
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:16.120]  be controlled back here on earth but this balkyrie robot will be on mars ideally building a habitat
[1:57:16.120 --> 1:57:23.000]  which then the humans will go into so there's no doubt that DARPA is so future thinking DARPA likes
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:31.160]  to say DARPA makes the future happen but again people just will really benefit from having a
[1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:39.320]  handle on what that future may or may not look like because the one really spooky element of all
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:46.120]  of this that i came to was learning at the end of my book how you know defense contractors have become
[1:57:46.120 --> 1:57:53.160]  advisors to DARPA and that's a real problem because it you know it's what eisenhower warned against
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:59.240]  with the military industrial complex when you have a closed loop when the guys who are actually
[1:57:59.240 --> 1:58:05.960]  making money um building these robotic systems building these drones are the ones who are advising
[1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:12.920]  the pentagon to create more drones create a system of robotic so they are controlling the future
[1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:17.400]  they're not just getting the money they are now controlling the evolution of human development
[1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:23.640]  well absolutely and this is this is literally science fact not science fiction
[1:58:23.640 --> 1:58:30.840]  and it's why it's worth being an alert and knowledgeable citizen amazing well thank you
[1:58:30.840 --> 1:58:35.880]  so much i'm going to read your book hopefully you'll join us again thank you so much anytime

[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:32.360]  you don't know how good brain force is i didn't mean to do a plug right now i wanted one because
[2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:37.000]  i'm a little bit tired i'm taking one today i forgot this morning i had a brain force sitting
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:41.480]  here there's like 10 pills left in it and some little mouse around here is eating my brain force
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:47.960]  so i just had to go get another bottle during that break and open it up and it was painful opening
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:54.360]  that's why i made the fist comment it wasn't punching biggs that made my fist hurt though
[2:00:54.360 --> 2:01:01.400]  punching a steel door but i still got it i put a little dent in it that was a little parlor trick
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:05.400]  in high school punched the school doors and dent them girls got impressed by that
[2:01:08.040 --> 2:01:12.680]  and the next guy would try it break his hand of course the big secret is you got to have
[2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:15.640]  your hand basically broken pretty much all the time and then it doesn't hurt so bad
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:21.400]  yeah it's like a spongy smash knock i'm joking that didn't happen i'm trying to act tough to
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:27.560]  impress everybody folks anyways uh getting back to what i was covering earlier on the whole DARPA
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:31.720]  situation secret is not minding the pain
[2:01:35.160 --> 2:01:40.440]  pain almost reminds you you're alive it's weird you have pain long enough it just becomes part of
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:46.600]  it's weird anyway side issue uh peter shifts coming up let me put this addendum in fact when
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:50.440]  we put this on youtube or facebook let's let's cut that last minute and a half rant that made no
[2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:56.280]  sense because i'm literally just babbling the addendum to that whole DARPA interview
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:00.280]  is that if i just sit here and attack DARPA it's not going to be effective reaching out to people
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:05.320]  let the Pentagon and these big corporations and companies obviously i want life extension
[2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:10.360]  technologies obviously i want my kids to have access to it obviously i want humans to progress
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:16.520]  a lot of what DARPA does is super sexy the problem is they are eugenicists they are transhumanists
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:22.840]  that set it up it's not being evenly distributed it's our money our tax money that's paying for
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:27.320]  this and it's being given to globalist corporations that build their factories in communist china in
[2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:33.960]  india and it doesn't even help those people they're so greedy they sold globalism that we're gonna
[2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:38.360]  build factories in the third world and make them paradises and build them up i would go for that
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:46.840]  you guys don't do that it'd be one thing if you had a 600 foot yacht you know the size of
[2:02:46.840 --> 2:02:51.880]  an aircraft carrier or whatever and then you actually did that off say book sales or something
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:57.640]  or a widget but you do it through government contracts you've robbed then you are so greedy
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:03.160]  you don't have a 200 foot yacht you got a 600 foot yacht from stolen money and you won't even build it
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:10.920]  here when we paid for it you jerks i mean what's your problem you got bad will towards people and
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:15.080]  so you're not fit to direct anything and you sat there and you got all the smartest kids out of
[2:03:15.080 --> 2:03:20.680]  high school and college since the 50s and you built this thing and you didn't build it you were
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:26.520]  smart enough to swindle it with a bunch of goodwill people but you didn't build it and it's not yours
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:32.680]  and you're not giving it to the people and you're disgusting instead you're putting your you give us
[2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:38.920]  mercury and shots you give us cancer viruses oh thank you you're so nice what what great gods
[2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:42.760]  you are you claim you're becoming gods you don't act like any god i ever heard of that was any good
[2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:50.360]  you act like punks you act like pieces of trash you act like psychopaths my god's not somebody
[2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:55.560]  that grabs kids out of backyards and tortures them that's not my god i know you got a brand new god
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:04:00.840]  and you're you're really cool and everything what you got is a bunch of smart people you hijacked
[2:04:00.840 --> 2:04:04.520]  who are waking up to you right now and you hope the floor is gonna dumb us down it doesn't work
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:11.320]  buddy it doesn't work on some people you know that and so they want to make all their drones
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:16.600]  autonomous to get the military and the pentagon out of the equation and to give the technocrats
[2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:23.480]  military control that's their big dream that's why the military is fighting the pentagon advanced
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:29.960]  research science boards that are saying just make everything autonomous and the way you kill it is
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:35.240]  you bring up stuff like oh look at the trojans inside the cell phones look at the trojans inside
[2:04:36.120 --> 2:04:42.440]  the emissions testing of vw stuff like that obviously you don't say is you can't sell that
[2:04:42.440 --> 2:04:47.720]  to the public they're too naive right now i mean i'll do that you can't say oh you know a foreign
[2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:52.920]  governmental hacker it'll take control of the ai will that's inevitable if you keep you down this
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:57.800]  road so are you guys smart enough to not go the atlantean realm because you're about to be there

[2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:33.720]  oh
[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:47.160]  that's right we're called america that's 1776 tattooed as well
[2:08:47.160 --> 2:08:56.440]  her egg starts to itch black don't turn to red
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:09:06.520]  oh
[2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:08.520]  let's be clear
[2:09:18.600 --> 2:09:19.880]  we're not trying to be
[2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:28.920]  be alarmists i am alarmed though so i'm not going to lie to you it is what it is
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:39.640]  russia has completely upstaged the united states and made our criminal government look like absolute
[2:09:39.640 --> 2:09:46.920]  fools which i don't particularly like because it's our country not the globalists that they're using
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:52.040]  and running in the ground a lot of people are all happy that the russians are going in and
[2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:57.480]  killing al qaeda and blowing up al nazar and going after is and yes i'm happy about that but
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:06.440]  this is part of a larger globalist operation in the final equation that discredits this country
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:11.000]  because we could take this country back anytime and turn the prosperity engine on cut the taxes
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:16.200]  cut the spending make all the welfare folks start working stop paying for the anchor babies
[2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:20.760]  and this country would go to 10 growth rates in a few years historically i mean we did till
[2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:28.040]  we got the federal reserve we did till the great depression the first hundred and fifty years this
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:38.520]  country was like heaven i mean it was foreign russian and japanese and french historians
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:44.280]  came over here and we're just like this is awesome we had most of the inventions we
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:50.760]  were the trailblazers uh we had the best boxers we had the best horsemen if you got in a war with us
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:54.680]  we'd kick your butt we beat the british empire nobody could beat them
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:10:59.800]  you're just more british than british
[2:11:03.800 --> 2:11:12.120]  and now look at us serving al qaeda roiders yesterday i read that article three four times
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:15.640]  an hour on air roiders in fact you guys dig in the stack and find it was what about russia
[2:11:15.640 --> 2:11:22.520]  begins airstrikes and i that said the pentagon and and the un and and blah blah and right there
[2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:26.840]  in the article it talks about the president and the defense department criticizing russia for not
[2:11:26.840 --> 2:11:31.480]  bombing isis but bombing al qaeda bases that are quote the pentagon sees as moderate i mean this is
[2:11:31.480 --> 2:11:36.040]  how disconnected our elite are that they will put in roiders in the associated press in the
[2:11:36.040 --> 2:11:42.440]  york times they all reported yesterday i couldn't believe it i couldn't believe it that you shouldn't
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:51.480]  bomb the moderates and then it said al qaeda i don't know if our elite are our our so i mean
[2:11:51.480 --> 2:11:56.680]  maybe peter shifts right it's not a conspiracy maybe they were just living off our smart ancestors
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:01.880]  and and and and this elite is completely inept and that's what we're talking about
[2:12:01.880 --> 2:12:07.000]  ancestors and and and this elite is completely inept and that's even scarier
[2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:13.720]  i don't know how they get away with giving trillions of dollars to select banks that
[2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:17.480]  taxpayers got to pay for i don't know how they get away with fixing the interest rates and
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:22.200]  fixing the currency rates i don't know how they've held it up this long but the truth is they didn't
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:27.800]  hold it up this long as peter shift said the job numbers are fake but even the fake numbers are
[2:12:27.800 --> 2:12:35.880]  hellish 94 million 610 thousand americans not in labor force participation rate lowest since 1977
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:44.200]  record 56 plus million women not working yeah like black unemployment's doubled i mean where's
[2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:49.800]  the liberal empowerment jobs up only for immigrants that's his immigrants gotta give it to him or
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:58.040]  smart enough to get on welfare and get a job because you sure can't live on those paychecks but
[2:12:58.040 --> 2:13:02.760]  remember the fed said they're never gonna raise the rates and that's what they've they've just come
[2:13:02.760 --> 2:13:06.520]  out and said that peter shift said they'd they never can he's pretty much the only guy saying
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:11.000]  they never will and then they said a month ago oh we're not gonna raise it but we are gonna
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:15.160]  raise it down the road uh peter shift joins us because we we have people on that are accurate
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:19.480]  people that are right people that actually want to tell the truth but but i always thought mainstream
[2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:24.360]  media just wanted to lie i guess peter would say they're stupid maybe peter's right i you know i'm
[2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:30.040]  gonna say i'm the smartest guy around but i make pretty good decisions in my life and i think i've
[2:13:30.040 --> 2:13:35.960]  got a blind spot that i think other people are smart like i am and maybe i need to get smarter
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:43.720]  and realize that no a lot of people are super stupid but regardless i don't care if the government's
[2:13:43.720 --> 2:13:52.840]  got a mass of people that will go along with say turning our guns in or opening our borders up and
[2:13:52.840 --> 2:13:57.400]  paying for everything for free i have a right to not be a slave and pay for all this and that's what
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:03.640]  the bill of rights states doesn't matter you get 51 percent selling horse winner and saying it's
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:08.600]  chocolate cake i don't have to eat it and i hate to use a gross analogy but that if it fits you
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:13.640]  gotta use it peter i'm ranting here i'm not happy that you've been proven right i'm not happy we
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:17.640]  have been proven right because i realize the public has no idea on average what's going on not our
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:23.160]  audience a lot of them are smarter than i am i just i i just have this this intellectual view
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:28.200]  but also this feeling that i'm like an insane asylum or something i mean how crazy is this gonna get
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:33.080]  well you know i think a lot more data is gonna come out before the general public
[2:14:33.080 --> 2:14:39.080]  i can accept that i'm right or maybe not the general public the so-called experts on the economy
[2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:44.760]  the very experts that basically said that there was about a 90 chance the fed was going to raise
[2:14:44.760 --> 2:14:51.560]  rates by december now i was saying that the chance was closer to zero now that we got today's horrible
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:57.000]  jobs report and i'm going to talk about that but now those experts are changing their forecasts
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:15:01.640]  and now they're saying well now that we got this new information maybe the fed is going to wait
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:07.160]  until march look i didn't need to see this job data to know the fed wasn't going to raise rates
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:12.280]  because they will prick their own bubble but let's look at how bad this jobs report was because it
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:19.240]  was really really bad right they were expecting 203 000 jobs we only got 142 000 right that's
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:24.360]  way less than even the lowest end of the estimate and that's them pumping with giant fire hoses
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:29.400]  thousand dollar bills yeah but they went back and they revised last month which was originally
[2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:35.800]  reported at 173 everybody was expecting that to be revised up to above 200 i remember on
[2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:43.000]  cmbc mark zandy chief economist moody's dot com when that 173 number came out he said ignore it
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:47.560]  it means nothing they're going to revise it up it's well over 200 000 we're going to get another
[2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:57.000]  200 000 next month everything is great they revised that number down all the way uh to 136 000 from
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:02.840]  you know so that's 70 000 less and isn't that cook numbers anyways too well who knows if they're
[2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:08.760]  cooked but they're still lousy they even even if they're cooked and then they went back to the month
[2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:15.080]  before that and they revised that down too so they revised down two months this month was lousy
[2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:21.480]  then look at you you alluded to labored force participation dropped to 62.4 that's a new low
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:27.640]  for this cycle you got to go back to the 1970s to get a participation rate that low but you know
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:34.040]  that doesn't tell the real story because as you remember back in the early 1970s most married
[2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:39.160]  women didn't work because they didn't have to because their husbands could afford to support them
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:44.040]  but today you have all these women working because men can't afford to support themselves
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:16:49.720]  alone their wives isn't it wonderful yeah but if you look at male labor force participation
[2:16:49.720 --> 2:16:54.440]  it has never been this low in the history of the republic there have never been such a small
[2:16:54.440 --> 2:17:00.600]  percentage of men who have jobs than now look at the wages they were expecting real wages to
[2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:06.360]  go up point two they were flat you know and that doesn't adjust for inflation and average work week
[2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:13.720]  went down this was a horrible report and of course if you look at the the jobs by you know category
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:20.280]  we lost manufacturing jobs we lost mining and logging jobs we lost wholesale trade jobs these
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:27.960]  are the good paying jobs what jobs did we create government jobs we waiters bartenders uh people
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:35.320]  that ring cash registers orderlies and hospitals we created low paying minimum wage jobs and we
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:41.560]  destroyed the good jobs that you can support a family on that's what's going on now as i
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:46.760]  introed it is it on purpose or is it just ineptitude i mean they got a lot of professors
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:50.360]  clowered and pivoted saying they want to make everybody dependent look they're not smart enough
[2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:55.160]  to do this on purpose if the government was trying to wreck the economy it'd be booming i mean the
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:18:00.920]  fact of the matter is you know that these politicians just want to get elected uh wall street is
[2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:05.480]  concerned about stimulating stock prices they don't care so they're just giving us happy pills and
[2:18:05.480 --> 2:18:12.760]  we're drug addicts yeah i mean even uh carl icon came out with this uh video recently danger ahead
[2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:16.840]  you know when you got mainstream billionaires starting to figure it out right it's getting near
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:22.200]  the end of the game except you know he he thought that the fed had been giving the economy medicine
[2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:26.600]  and he was worried what was going to happen when the medicine went away you know the zero percent
[2:18:26.600 --> 2:18:32.440]  rates he's got the metaphor wrong it's not medicine because medicine implies that it's helping it's
[2:18:32.440 --> 2:18:38.120]  it's monetary heroin uh it's a steroid or as you know it's it's a painkiller whatever the fed's
[2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:44.280]  been giving us has been making the economy sicker but numbing us to the pain but he did have a an
[2:18:44.280 --> 2:18:50.440]  image a photograph and i've used this analogy myself too of everybody partying on a bus and then
[2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:54.920]  janet yell and pushing the bus and you can see in the picture that the bus is going to go over the
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:19:00.840]  edge of a cliff but no one cares because they're having so much fun partying on the bus uh you
[2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:04.760]  know they're not paying attention because the elite are the recipients of the money up front
[2:19:04.760 --> 2:19:10.520]  and they they just they just can't help themselves oh yeah and you know the thing is you know this
[2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:17.320]  number came out gold's up 20 25 bucks i mean that's nothing it's still below 11 40 the dollars down
[2:19:17.320 --> 2:19:23.080]  a little bit people still don't get it they're still clinging to the idea okay well the fed won't
[2:19:23.080 --> 2:19:28.440]  raise uh by december but they'll do it early next year they're not going to raise right they still
[2:19:28.440 --> 2:19:34.600]  think this is a recovery it's not and these job numbers are only going to get worse and wait till
[2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:41.400]  next year comes and we start losing jobs in fact if you look at the um the numbers that came out
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:47.320]  today on factory orders horrible numbers the tenth consecutive year over the numbers i got family
[2:19:47.320 --> 2:19:50.520]  and friends i know the economy is literally in the toilet but we'll go over those numbers with

[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:13.720]  9231 800 259 9231 you know peter it really is gallows humor peter shiff of euro pack dot com
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:20.040]  joins us billions under management um predicted the big bubble in 2008 when no one believed it and
[2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:25.320]  a lot of other predictions predicted three four years ago that there'd be a crash last year basically
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:29.640]  well there is a crash all over the world we're just drinking jim jones koolaid here and don't know it
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:34.840]  yet so i think his prediction the gerol salentes and others was accurate but clearly it's going on
[2:25:34.840 --> 2:25:41.240]  now more intensely they're trying to paper over it how do you see this unfolding now with the
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:46.440]  technicals without getting too technical uh in the next few years i mean in your gut you're talking
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:51.480]  to your wife we're talking to you know one of your investors where you know sitting around a cocktail
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:55.240]  what does peter shiff really thinks going to happen i mean just be honest with us nobody's
[2:25:55.240 --> 2:25:59.960]  holding you to a prediction but but specifically what do you think's going to happen yeah well
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:05.160]  first of all i wanted to you know continue where i left off about the other data that came out today
[2:26:05.160 --> 2:26:10.360]  the factory orders which were down uh you know for the tenth month in a row down more than expected
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:14.840]  this has never happened outside of a recession right you've never seen this unless we were in
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:21.480]  a recession and the atlanta fed gdp now numbers they predicted they came out a couple days ago
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:27.320]  or yesterday and revised their forecast for q3 third quarter to just point nine but i think
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:32.440]  now that this new jobs data is out and we got these factory orders there's a good chance that
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:37.880]  we're going to have a negative quarter in the third quarter and if we're negative in the third
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:42.840]  quarter i bet we're also negative in the fourth quarter because the fourth quarter tends to be
[2:26:42.840 --> 2:26:47.560]  pretty weak they've been very weak during the last seven years so i think if we get a negative
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:52.360]  third quarter we'll have a negative fourth quarter we'll have two negative quarters back to back
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:58.440]  there's your recession now what happens now the fed has to react to that recession rates will still
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:04.920]  be at zero so they can't cut them what are they going to do qe4 right and that is when the bottom
[2:27:04.920 --> 2:27:09.960]  drops out of the dollar if it hasn't already done it by then i think there is a great opportunity
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:16.200]  for your listeners to get out of dollars i mean the dollars are still up we've had this huge rise
[2:27:16.200 --> 2:27:21.960]  in the dollar because these currency speculators just don't get it they still think the economy is
[2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:26.600]  in great shape they still think the fed's going to raise rates even though the chinese are exiting
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:32.200]  even though the chinese are exiting yeah when reality comes crashing into their expectations
[2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:38.280]  this is going to be a huge event like the collapse of the subprime like collapse of the dot com think
[2:27:38.280 --> 2:27:43.640]  of it as the dollar dot com or a subprime currency this thing is going to implode and i think when
[2:27:43.640 --> 2:27:48.600]  it drops it's going to drop quickly but people are going to make some serious money or they're
[2:27:48.600 --> 2:27:53.080]  going to protect so you think the dollar will plunge or basically jackknife or will it will it go down
[2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:57.000]  and bounce back up what do you expect to see yeah no no i think it's going to go down for the count
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:02.600]  remember it's been it's it's risen based on the expectations of all these rate hikes these rate
[2:28:02.600 --> 2:28:07.400]  hikes aren't coming the dollar has risen because everybody thinks the fed has finished printing
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:12.360]  money they're only getting warmed up they got a lot more printing yet to come so this is an
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:17.800]  opportunity before people wake up for people to you know open up accounts with me or other people
[2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:23.080]  they can do foreign investing get out of us dollars buy some foreign stocks get your money into
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:28.360]  switzerland get into singapore get into new zealand get some gold stocks they're dirt cheap they're
[2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:33.320]  giving these things away because people are clueless as to what's going to happen well i know this i'm
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:38.280]  no rocket scientist but folks should hedge their bets obviously i mean everybody is making bad
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:43.240]  bets and that's how you make money in the market take the other side of the bad bets people made
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:47.720]  money shorting subprime they made money shorting dot coms people are going to make it how much money
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:54.760]  did you make predicting the 2008 for your customers well my customers lost in 2008 right i had customers
[2:28:54.760 --> 2:29:01.960]  that made a lot of money in 2007 on the collapse of subprime but in 2008 all the foreign stocks that
[2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:09.080]  we owned went down the dollar went up in 2008 the dollar didn't go down until 2009 that's when foreign
[2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:14.600]  stocks went back down the road you made money but we have we haven't had a dollar collapse yet i've
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:19.480]  been preparing for a dollar collapse for a long time when my clients made the most money on the
[2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:25.560]  week dollar was from 2001 to 2008 that's when people betting against the dollar were making a
[2:29:25.560 --> 2:29:30.760]  ton of money because the dollar fell for seven years and hit an all-time low gold went from
[2:29:30.760 --> 2:29:36.920]  under 300 to a thousand oil went from under 20 bucks to 150 i want to talk about oil
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:41.640]  well exactly we got to go to break definitely things are volatile definitely we're built a house
[2:29:41.640 --> 2:29:46.680]  on top of volcano that's active so i don't know exactly what's going to happen but it's not good
[2:29:46.680 --> 2:29:51.080]  i'm trying to figure out what to do just like you are on say with us the empires on the run
[2:29:51.960 --> 2:29:54.840]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:29:59.240 --> 2:30:04.440]  selective outrage obama hasn't said a damn word about routine mass shootings in chicago
[2:30:04.440 --> 2:30:08.680]  following the mass shooting in organ thursday the president delivered a 12-minute tirade
[2:30:08.680 --> 2:30:12.840]  about the need for stricter gun control laws it admitted he was politicizing the incident before
[2:30:12.840 --> 2:30:18.360]  the body count was even in when he wasn't referring to himself 28 times visibly angry obama called
[2:30:18.360 --> 2:30:23.880]  mass shootings in the u.s routine somehow this has become routine obama said my response here
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:29.000]  this podium has become routine and what becomes routine is the response from those who oppose any

[2:34:13.240 --> 2:34:19.480]  a civilization for humanity together and the globalists have made the decision to basically
[2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:24.680]  create monopolies for themselves and necessarily out of that they develop a hatred for humanity
[2:34:24.680 --> 2:34:31.960]  because who wants to do something they don't enjoy and so peter schiff has been pretty accurate
[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:35.400]  predicting what's going to happen is our guest i want him to be able to roll with what he thinks
[2:34:35.400 --> 2:34:40.680]  is going to unfold now other areas in the economy and then i want to go to your phone calls here

[2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:24.120]  team just like russian bombers fighter bombers being loaded up with weapons to go attack isis
[2:37:24.120 --> 2:37:26.920]  and al-qaeda targets god bless them because our criminal government won't do it
[2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:35.000]  the people fueling those jets people loading those bombs on those jets are just as important
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:40.280]  as the pilot going in to pull the trigger now peter shiff i like getting interviews with you
[2:37:40.280 --> 2:37:44.120]  we get into politics in the world and not just your economics i was not like it's a five minute
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:49.480]  interview on on cnbc so i've got a few political questions and calls for you but other points
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:53.960]  you want to telegraph to folks saying the economy would get worse saying this would continue you've
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:37:58.840]  been proven right on that so what do you say is coming next well let me finish up what i was talking
[2:37:58.840 --> 2:38:05.960]  about before the break on you know why uh my clients did so well with me from 2001 to 2008
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:12.200]  was because the dollar bubble that had inflated in the late 1990s burst and then the dollar fell
[2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:17.880]  for seven years well we have a bigger dollar bubble now than we have then the fundamentals for the
[2:38:17.880 --> 2:38:22.840]  us economy are much worse now than they were then the fundamentals for the dollar are much worse
[2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:27.960]  so when this bubble bursts look out below i think the people who are betting against the dollar
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:32.920]  by buying foreign currencies by buying foreign stocks by owning precious metals look silver's
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:37.880]  up about five percent today alone but this is just the beginning right metals are going to move much
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:41.800]  much higher i think people are going to make more money in gold and silver and gold and silver
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:47.640]  stocks in this next leg of the bull market then they did from 2001 to 2008 and those are some
[2:38:47.640 --> 2:38:51.560]  very very good years for the people that were invested in that market and you know a lot of
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:55.720]  people have been making fun of me on CNBC oh Peter Schiff's been predicting a weak dollar
[2:38:55.720 --> 2:39:02.360]  and it hasn't fallen wait till they see how weak this dollar is going to get no one has any idea
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:07.000]  how quickly and how much value the dollar is going to lose and you know i just put up another video
[2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:14.680]  of some of my predictions from 2006 if you go on youtube and you search it for 2006 all over again
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:20.360]  look at the things i was saying and the reason i did 2006 was the real estate market blew up in
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:28.040]  07 not 08 the financial crisis happened in 08 but the real estate market blew up in 07 and in 2006
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:34.680]  nobody saw it coming and watch some of those videos from 2006 this is how clueless the mainstream
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:39.720]  can be including the federal reserve when there is a disaster right around the corner and they
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:45.080]  can't see it so we have another disaster it's around another corner i can see it and i think
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:49.160]  people need to protect themselves and they need to get their financial ducks in a row now
[2:39:49.160 --> 2:39:54.520]  because if you wait too long it's going to be too late because once the dollar collapses if all you
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:40:00.120]  got is dollars you know you're holding a bunch of paper let me put it to you this way i said before
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:05.080]  the break we built a house on top an active volcano smoke's coming out some lava's boiling
[2:40:05.080 --> 2:40:09.640]  around the ground's rumbling some rocks are bouncing down the side of the cliff i don't know
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:16.280]  what it's going to blow up the the seismologists don't know the volcanologists don't know all i know
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:23.080]  is i've looked at history this never goes well let's say you're wrong could the laws of economics
[2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:28.680]  be suspended with computers or whatever could this just go on forever i mean what are some of the
[2:40:28.680 --> 2:40:35.640]  other scenarios if you're wrong it can't go on forever right and the fact that 2008 really that
[2:40:35.640 --> 2:40:41.160]  was the beginning of the end the process has already started so we're already here but yes they have
[2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:47.880]  found ways to delay the process stretch it out but only at the cost of making it worse realizing the
[2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:52.520]  fed now is really in a box because they've been pretending they were going to raise rates for
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:56.600]  years and now their backs are to the wall and they have to admit that they're not going to do it and
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:01.960]  when they have to allow a launch qe4 and when everybody thought the fed was finished and that
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:06.200]  it had worked and now they find out that it didn't work and they have to do it all over again the
[2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:12.840]  fed's credibility is gone and the next leg of the dollar bear market is going to begin and this is
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:18.280]  not going to be you know stretched out beyond the decade i mean we're going to live through this look
[2:41:18.280 --> 2:41:23.480]  the chinese are already selling their treasuries this is the tip of a huge iceberg i think all these
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:27.720]  emerging market economies from southeast asia from latin america are going to be dumping their
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:32.920]  treasuries maybe by next year all these countries bought trillions of dollars worth of treasuries
[2:41:32.920 --> 2:41:39.000]  in 2010 2011 when they were fighting a currency war to prevent their currencies from rising
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:43.800]  as we were doing quantitative easing they're not going to make that same mistake twice the next
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:48.040]  time the dollar goes down it's not going to have any friends no one's going to be buying it no one's
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:52.680]  going to fight that currency war again america's going to lose that war and anybody that owns the
[2:41:52.680 --> 2:41:58.840]  u.s dollar is going to lose that war i think my gut tells me and look at the economics and history
[2:41:58.840 --> 2:42:04.200]  i think you're on the money i think other weird stuff could happen stuff so upside down it's so
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:08.920]  crazy but regardless we're headed to some very unstable times i want to make this point get
[2:42:08.920 --> 2:42:12.760]  your take on it and go to calls pierce shift again as our guests right now you're listening to the
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:20.200]  alex joneshub i see putin being worshiped being lionized the commenters on my site but other
[2:42:20.200 --> 2:42:27.640]  mainstream sites youtube as if he's jesus or something i see that as a bellwether of the
[2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:35.960]  incredible disdain discontent hatred the american people have the disillusionment with our government
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:42.200]  and the mainstream media at the same yeah i mean look look at how popular trump is or look at
[2:42:42.200 --> 2:42:47.320]  birdie standards i mean people are fed up and they are reaching for anything that's different
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:51.240]  right anything that anybody that sounds like maybe they can make a difference and you know
[2:42:51.240 --> 2:42:56.040]  one of the things i like about trump is he's got a lot of the problems right he identifies the
[2:42:56.040 --> 2:43:01.400]  problems that a lot of other candidates don't want to address but he doesn't really offer
[2:43:01.400 --> 2:43:06.840]  solutions that will work because the solutions that will work you know involve a lot of political
[2:43:06.840 --> 2:43:11.160]  but yeah it involves cutting programs but he doesn't want to talk about that he says i'm
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:15.720]  going to save social security i'm going to give out free healthcare right so he doesn't want to
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:23.880]  really say i've got the bitter tasting medicine he's got the right problems but he's got a quackery
[2:43:23.880 --> 2:43:27.960]  type of solutions that that aren't going to work i agree so let's get into putin just because i
[2:43:27.960 --> 2:43:33.160]  want your take on this specifically to finish it i see the collapse in american confidence
[2:43:33.160 --> 2:43:37.240]  the mainstream news saying putin's not a leader of the free world not that putin's really the free
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:43.480]  world uh it's it's that we've lost so much confidence the world has that this serious
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:51.720]  situation in syria pun intended is is really the iceberg peeking up above the surface
[2:43:51.720 --> 2:43:58.040]  showing that the world is beginning to turn on america i mean i really think the full confidence
[2:43:58.040 --> 2:44:03.240]  of the world is beginning to shift and once it goes it's going to go quick yeah and what's going to
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:08.200]  accelerate that process is the drop of the dollar and then piercing this mystique that
[2:44:08.200 --> 2:44:12.920]  we've got this great economy this sound economy that our leaders know what they're doing that our
[2:44:12.920 --> 2:44:19.000]  central bankers are somehow geniuses when that myth is pierced right this is a whole new ballgame
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:23.240]  and people the world is going to look at america through a whole different uh perspective
[2:44:25.640 --> 2:44:29.720]  what do you expect that fallout to be like it's not going to be pretty
[2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:34.120]  you know i mean it we're we're going to have to get used to living in a whole new reality
[2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:38.280]  where you know the dollar is not the center of the monetary system and that means americans
[2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:42.600]  can't live beyond our means i mean americans take for granted that we can buy all kinds of
[2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:47.080]  stuff that we don't produce we don't have the factories that make all the stuff you know our
[2:44:47.080 --> 2:44:52.680]  production is so low in fact you know my brother was doing some calls uh of reporters asking you
[2:44:52.680 --> 2:44:57.880]  know why are you not you know recovering all this horrible uh manufacturing data that all the fed
[2:44:57.880 --> 2:45:01.880]  surveys are showing and the reporter told my brother well we don't really pay attention to
[2:45:01.880 --> 2:45:06.120]  manufacturing anymore because it's such a small part of the economy nobody cares about it which
[2:45:06.120 --> 2:45:12.280]  says so much a that it's so small but b that nobody even cares about it you need to care about it
[2:45:12.280 --> 2:45:17.240]  because it shouldn't be small how can we not manufacture if we want to consume we have to
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:23.160]  produce uh so we live because the world is dumb enough to trade the stuff yeah we produce paper
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:28.200]  money and these people don't think that's a problem it just shows the fundamental disconnect
[2:45:28.200 --> 2:45:33.160]  that when things do collapse which it will what goes up must come down they are they are going to be
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:37.640]  just a nightmare force to deal with can you imagine these hordes of ignorant trendies peter
[2:45:37.640 --> 2:45:42.920]  what they're going to be like during a depression oh look you know america had a lot more stability
[2:45:42.920 --> 2:45:47.240]  during the 1930s when we had that depression can you imagine imagine what would go on on
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:52.840]  bread lines today i mean what what would americans do in this situation like the 1930s i mean look
[2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:57.640]  what happens you know look how they riot and loot just you know when something goes wrong or
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:02.920]  look at what they do when their team wins a sporting event you know i mean imagine something
[2:46:02.920 --> 2:46:08.200]  really bad you know imagine what's going to happen then you know the the sad part is pretty
[2:46:08.200 --> 2:46:13.960]  soon we're not going to have to imagine it we're going to live through it to time bomb we live on
[2:46:13.960 --> 2:46:20.680]  top of time bomb we are sitting on top of time bomb and our politicians and leaders are not doing
[2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:25.880]  anything to try to reverse this but they are buying armored redouts so i guess they i think the
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:29.080]  establishment knows where this is going peter they're just trying to put it off as long as they
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:35.640]  can trying to milk it well absolutely and you know by postponing it they extend and pretend
[2:46:36.200 --> 2:46:41.640]  but the problems get worse that means the solution ultimately is more painful but it
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:47.320]  does provide a window of opportunity for people who have not yet prepared themselves financially
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:51.880]  to do so and that's you know one of the reasons i come on your program i think it's important
[2:46:51.880 --> 2:46:57.560]  for people to be prepared i mean when when this thing collapses i want as many americans as possible
[2:46:57.560 --> 2:47:03.000]  not to go broke uh because so many will and the important thing is to have people to understand
[2:47:03.800 --> 2:47:08.680]  you know why the country is in so much trouble to have the resources to help do something to help
[2:47:08.680 --> 2:47:14.760]  build it back up again well if government just would cut its size and cut taxes we'd be fine
[2:47:14.760 --> 2:47:19.400]  you're absolutely right folks need to be prepared everything the system wants us for us to be dependent
[2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:24.600]  uh let's take some phone calls here uh let's go ahead and talk to a wild in wisconsin you're on
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:33.320]  the air with peter schiff hey mr jones to interlink these two guests uh mr schiff can you please
[2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:41.240]  explain to me the dynamic ways money has become a tool number one for population control and brainwashing
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:47.800]  well money is used for social engineering go ahead bitter well i don't know about brainwashing
[2:47:47.800 --> 2:47:51.880]  i mean they certainly do that in the public school system that's for sure but you know
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:57.400]  you know money the government uses money to buy votes and those votes give it power and that's
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:02.840]  what happens you know we encourage uh bad behavior through the tax code we give people money not to
[2:48:02.840 --> 2:48:07.320]  work we give people money to have children out of wedlock uh we punish people when they work hard
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:12.280]  we take their money you know you know when you really realize how how how few rights you have in
[2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:15.800]  america is when you go out and start a business that's when the government really starts oh yeah
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:22.360]  you find out don't you yeah uh so we encourage uh all the wrong things and we discourage all the
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:27.400]  right things and sure money is the is is the tool that they use and the federal reserve
[2:48:27.400 --> 2:48:31.080]  is creating those tools and there are a lot of people that are getting rich and of course the
[2:48:31.080 --> 2:48:35.480]  people who are getting rich are recycling their wealth back to the politicians that's one of the
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:40.440]  other things that trump has right that all these politicians are for sale you know they raise taxes
[2:48:40.440 --> 2:48:45.880]  way up and now people have to give them money to get special tax breaks to avoid those taxes that's
[2:48:45.880 --> 2:48:50.440]  one of the reasons they're so high in the first place because they use them as a as a club to shake
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:55.160]  people down to get some extra money so that people can be exempted from taxes that if they weren't
[2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:59.960]  high in the first place the politicians wouldn't have the power to extort all that money to secure
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:07.080]  their their their power absolutely on target peter shifts our guests i'm alec shones jerry and
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:14.040]  indiana you're on the air go ahead greetings salutations go ahead brother i just don't really
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:20.920]  have a question just a comment um i don't worry too much about around us up as much as we already
[2:49:20.920 --> 2:49:27.720]  live in a financial prison uh you can't hardly make a dollar beyond if you're not already in the middle
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:33.480]  class try to climb your way up as nearly impossible it's like down in an alley with a piece of play
[2:49:33.480 --> 2:49:38.040]  though you're just not going to get it done and there's so many men out there feet are touched
[2:49:38.040 --> 2:49:43.400]  on it that are just frustrated from just trying to feed their family exactly the harder you work
[2:49:43.400 --> 2:49:49.560]  the more they tax you screw you over so why not exactly yeah i mean i get in between my insurance
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:49:55.560]  and my taxes i pay 38 percent of my income before i even touch it then they want to ask me again when
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:50:00.760]  i buy something and men are so pinned up and so frustrated i talked to them and the first thing
[2:50:00.760 --> 2:50:04.680]  they're going to do with things fall apart they're just going to start randomly act of violence
[2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:08.040]  it's because they're so well we don't want to do that let me let me ask peter this question
[2:50:08.680 --> 2:50:11.320]  aren't more and more people just going to stop complying with the system
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:17.640]  well it's eventually out of necessity i mean if you can't even survive and pay the taxes i mean
[2:50:17.640 --> 2:50:21.960]  yes compliance is going to go down that's one of the reasons i got my dad dying in prison
[2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:26.360]  is because he's there to discourage people from not paying taxes hey don't pay your taxes look
[2:50:26.360 --> 2:50:32.040]  you're going to end up like like erwin schiff but look you know the the the income taxes created
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:36.680]  more cheaters than golf i mean most people cheat because that's the only way they can survive
[2:50:36.680 --> 2:50:40.200]  you know but the government is the one that's cheating because the government is extorting
[2:50:40.200 --> 2:50:44.520]  a tax from the american public that legally nobody is required to pay but they don't care the court
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:50.120]  looks the other way they let the government uh you know uh avoid the constitutional restraints
[2:50:50.120 --> 2:50:54.520]  uh they don't impose uh the precedent of prior supreme court rulings they don't even abide by
[2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:58.680]  their own internal revenue code there are law into themselves they do whatever they want and nobody
[2:50:58.680 --> 2:51:06.120]  cares just a lawless group you 50 different cpas give you 50 different answers 50 different tax
[2:51:06.120 --> 2:51:11.320]  lawyers 50 different answers now the iris won't even give you advice they just wait for you to
[2:51:11.320 --> 2:51:17.400]  stick your neck in the bear trap yeah and you and you know i was even explaining this to my to my
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:21.640]  13 year old in the car today when i was driving him to school this morning but you know it's like
[2:51:21.640 --> 2:51:26.920]  the government creates a situation where they you know you figure everybody's pulling this wagon
[2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:31.880]  and the government starts incentivizing some people to get in the wagon and now some people jump
[2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:35.800]  with the wagon and initially you know it's okay because there's still a lot of people pulling it
[2:51:35.800 --> 2:51:39.720]  and you know they don't have to pull much harder because there's not that many people in the wagon
[2:51:39.720 --> 2:51:43.560]  but as more and more people look at the inside the wagon and realize it's more lucrative to be
[2:51:43.560 --> 2:51:48.760]  pulled around then the poll eventually you know all of a sudden the people that are pulling have to
[2:51:48.760 --> 2:51:53.640]  pull really hard because there's so many people in that wagon and so finally the people who are
[2:51:53.640 --> 2:51:58.120]  pulling say you know what this is they all decide to jump in the wagon because it's too hard to pull
[2:51:58.120 --> 2:52:02.280]  everybody wants to ride in it but you know what then the wagon doesn't go anywhere because everybody
[2:52:02.280 --> 2:52:07.320]  can't be in a wagon that nobody pulls and this is the key this is why the political left the
[2:52:07.320 --> 2:52:13.560]  political correctness bullies workers bullies men bullies families they know their parasites and
[2:52:13.560 --> 2:52:19.320]  they want to intimidate us and dominate us under totalitarianism so they can sit there and spit
[2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:24.280]  on us while we pull the wagon and keep us intimidated and following their order but that illusion is
[2:52:25.160 --> 2:52:29.960]  Alex I think by next year you're going to have over a hundred million Americans sitting in that
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:34.760]  wagon that's going to be a huge burden for the people who are still pulling it and then it's
[2:52:34.760 --> 2:52:40.040]  all of a sudden it's going to be a big switch where people are just going to give up and that's
[2:52:40.040 --> 2:52:45.160]  you know it doesn't work the economy can't work with so many people expecting other people to do
[2:52:45.160 --> 2:52:50.760]  the work because that's what the government has promised exactly so we are reaching that moment
[2:52:50.760 --> 2:52:54.600]  where any amount of intimidation is not going to work just like in a Soviet system people are going
[2:52:54.600 --> 2:53:00.680]  to stop working oh oh yeah you know and don't wait for it to happen you know prepare yourself
[2:53:00.680 --> 2:53:05.240]  financially now don't like don't wait till you're staring at this crisis in the rear view mirror
[2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:09.960]  now that's what i'm telling my clients is look you know we got to be early because you can't be late
[2:53:09.960 --> 2:53:14.840]  you know this is a you know you do not want to arrive late you got to be early because that's
[2:53:14.840 --> 2:53:19.960]  the only way uh you'll survive this thing financially is if you're already prepared
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:23.720]  when it hits like you know gonna get to be like a like a tornado coming you know you never see
[2:53:23.720 --> 2:53:28.200]  those things coming until they're right on top of you so you got to have some preparation otherwise
[2:53:28.200 --> 2:53:33.240]  by the time you see it you know it's too late undoubtedly we now have radar we know there's
[2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:37.480]  storms we know there's tornadoes the the debate is what are the tornadoes going to do and i think
[2:53:37.480 --> 2:53:41.320]  you've been pretty accurately you know saying where they're going to go but who can call this stuff
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:46.840]  it's it's uh it's very frustrating and and then to see the politicians getting themselves ready
[2:53:46.840 --> 2:53:50.920]  while telling us don't get ready is one of the most frustrating parts tim in olympia you're on
[2:53:50.920 --> 2:53:56.760]  the air with peter schiff go ahead yeah i got two questions uh when do you think we'll see record
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:54:01.880]  youth unemployment in america like in greece and then my second question is what can the young
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:07.160]  americans like in the early 20s learn from greece and other countries and how to prepare for what's
[2:54:07.160 --> 2:54:13.320]  common yeah well i don't know that we're ever going to get real record unemployment because
[2:54:13.320 --> 2:54:19.160]  the records aren't honest anymore you know uh because so many people lose their jobs and they're not
[2:54:19.160 --> 2:54:23.240]  considered unemployed the way the government counts them but i do think the official unemployment
[2:54:23.240 --> 2:54:29.640]  rate is going to go up and we might get back up closer to 10 percent in this next downturn from
[2:54:29.640 --> 2:54:35.640]  the 4.1 percent right now but if we ever get back up to 10 officially it's probably 25 30
[2:54:35.640 --> 2:54:40.760]  percent unofficially in fact it'll probably be higher than it was uh during the great depression
[2:54:40.760 --> 2:54:46.280]  if we actually measured it using the same methodology that we use to measure unemployment
[2:54:46.280 --> 2:54:50.600]  during the great depression but the government is not honest about these statistics because it
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:56.920]  wants to hide the truth beneath a blanket of these phony statistics and that is the 64 million dollar
[2:54:56.920 --> 2:55:02.840]  question we know about them cooking the interest rates the currencies the insurance just all of it
[2:55:03.560 --> 2:55:10.600]  but imagine what we don't know they're cooking that's the new variable in the equation to where i
[2:55:10.600 --> 2:55:16.280]  would agree with you on everything except who knows what rabbits they've got a weird new political
[2:55:16.280 --> 2:55:22.120]  economic drugs to introduce into the system i'm not saying they're miracles i mean obviously the
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:27.720]  economy's rotting on the vine but it's just who knows what's going to happen now look there's a
[2:55:27.720 --> 2:55:33.480]  limit to how far they can push this this phony engineered you know economy but the average
[2:55:33.480 --> 2:55:39.640]  person in the street living in the actual economy knows it's getting worse americans know their
[2:55:39.640 --> 2:55:45.160]  financial futures are slipping away they have no savings they have no net worth they're living
[2:55:45.160 --> 2:55:49.960]  that record level your kids move in with you they have a part-time job you keep up appearances you
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:55.720]  don't say we're in a depression you just keep your mouth shut yeah you know and the powers that be
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:56:01.880]  whether it's on wall street or in washington they don't want to acknowledge the reality they still
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:06.920]  want to hide behind these statistics the stock market set a record high home prices are at a
[2:56:06.920 --> 2:56:11.240]  record high yeah who could afford to buy a house we have record numbers of people renting and the
[2:56:11.240 --> 2:56:15.240]  rents are going up that is the problem and so are the utility bills and so are the property
[2:56:15.240 --> 2:56:21.160]  taxes inflation you know you have more people are spending now 30 40 50 percent of their incomes
[2:56:21.160 --> 2:56:26.360]  on rent you know this is this is a poor country when you have to spend more and more of your money
[2:56:26.360 --> 2:56:30.440]  on rent then you're going to have to spend more and more of your money on food this is characteristic
[2:56:30.440 --> 2:56:35.160]  of what happens in a poor country this is not a wealthy time in industrial country exactly those
[2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:40.280]  costs should be going down housing costs should be going down that's a sign of wealth let's go to
[2:56:40.280 --> 2:56:46.440]  jonathan in central america south of mexico go to malah jonathan you're on the air go ahead
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:53.240]  you're on the repeater shift well thanks actually uh this uh what i'm gonna make is uh
[2:56:54.760 --> 2:57:00.040]  particularly uh more in the sense of a comment and set of a question we're not free your phone go
[2:57:00.040 --> 2:57:07.640]  ahead and say it okay thanks so uh well of course speak from Guatemala i'm sure you both of you
[2:57:07.640 --> 2:57:14.760]  and everyone in the audience knows that i'm actually from the main country that sends people to the
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:20.280]  united states that of course being dialectical immigrants and if you take a look at the statistics
[2:57:20.280 --> 2:57:27.400]  actually for the migrant crisis that happened last year i'm not necessarily sure about the
[2:57:27.400 --> 2:57:33.880]  percentage but the majority of people were from Guatemala and there is something that
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:40.120]  trump says in which he is absolutely right and there is that uh for some reason
[2:57:40.840 --> 2:57:49.000]  many of our people are going up and onto the north and onto the slavery and everything and
[2:57:49.000 --> 2:57:56.200]  operating on trains crossing on desert becoming prostitutes et cetera but one thing that i've
[2:57:56.200 --> 2:58:04.760]  noticed that no one has even spoken about and i actually would like to address this is that um one
[2:58:04.760 --> 2:58:11.720]  of the main reasons that people are fleeing Guatemala and central america actually because um
[2:58:12.680 --> 2:58:23.000]  our countries are completely screwed over by the gangs that were absolute crime waves absolutely

[3:00:38.040 --> 3:00:42.120]  we got to the economy i mean really the main street media calls me all the time i want to
[3:00:42.120 --> 3:00:47.080]  do interviews i don't really do them anymore because they just want to talk to you like it's a prop
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:53.000]  to act like they're journalists to act like they actually went out and investigated something
[3:00:54.200 --> 3:01:01.400]  that's all it is but they always want to ask you you know how do you define your show i mean we
[3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:06.920]  are defined by what happens in the world and then we're trying to cover it from a perspective
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:12.680]  of individuals i mean i want to own guns to protect myself i want to innovate i want to live
[3:01:12.680 --> 3:01:19.080]  in a free country i don't want to have a corrupt government i want safe healthy clean medicine
[3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:27.000]  i want safe healthy clean water i want a good future that's what you want and when you really
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:31.720]  study stuff and get past the propaganda you find out you don't get the elite club unless you got
[3:01:31.720 --> 3:01:36.760]  really bad intentions for people and again i still don't understand this but now i totally get it
[3:01:38.360 --> 3:01:42.200]  you couldn't have morals and do the stuff you're doing you kill yourself you would you
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:47.320]  would disintegrate i mean i can't do anything bad and not just have incredible guilt over
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:51.160]  that's just how i'm genetically designed i'm programmed that way
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:02:00.200]  other people they don't have that programming and we have the programming to overcome and defeat
[3:02:00.200 --> 3:02:04.920]  these people but the globalists have done everything they can to block that programming
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:12.120]  and so i'm just here to hack that program i'm angry i'm upset i'm not afraid of these people
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:21.320]  i'm committed and in that is a great liberty it is the animating contest of liberty and you as
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:26.840]  listeners and as viewers and as supporters you are as integral to this operation as anything we do
[3:02:26.840 --> 3:02:32.360]  and i'm not here doing a pep talk folks it's the truth in that lies the secret to everything
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:41.480]  the animating contest of liberty be part of it anthony gutiarty has got a lot coming up in the
[3:02:41.480 --> 3:02:47.160]  next hour anthony joining us from studio a from the old radio studio uh what's some of the news
[3:02:47.160 --> 3:02:50.920]  you're going to be covering well we've got a lot of stuff we've got stacks that you didn't cover
[3:02:50.920 --> 3:02:55.640]  we've got some of the stores that aren't aren't opening on black friday and what it means but
[3:02:55.640 --> 3:03:01.160]  overall i want to talk about the secret of our societal controllers and how they keep us enslaved
[3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:06.520]  how the consumers are being the consumed and ultimately what we can do about it and again
[3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:12.600]  they're creating a consumer society that consumes us in a game people say well the globalists
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:18.040]  be going offshore are going to end up destroying their own market that's the point it's a military
[3:03:18.040 --> 3:03:25.080]  consolidation a full control ahead of the eugenics agenda they've got to shut down the economy to make
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:31.400]  us dependent on them it is a scientific blueprint and only admitting how diabolical it is can we try
[3:03:31.400 --> 3:03:38.680]  to a avert it exactly and it's at a societal level a global level an individual level and so
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:42.440]  much so many of us don't even understand that we're being consumed on a daily basis by everything
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:48.360]  you just said well why don't you just let the globalists consume you i mean why not just lie
[3:03:48.360 --> 3:03:52.760]  down in the ditch and be trendy and do what they say and pretend you're a winner and let them laugh
[3:03:52.760 --> 3:03:56.520]  at you and control your life i think that's the right thing to do i think it's not a good idea
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:04:00.600]  to stand up and actually take your health in your own hands your ideologies in your own hands and
[3:04:00.600 --> 3:04:05.960]  have your own brain i think it's good to be consumed and get upset that staples isn't open on black
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:09.560]  friday like so many people are and that's one of the stories i want to talk about i also want to
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:15.400]  talk about um you know just seizing commercial property to house migrants is good too and that's
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:20.200]  not stealing that's fine yeah and what's ruining relationships is now partners using their cell
[3:04:20.200 --> 3:04:24.280]  phone instead of talking to each other a new study confirms and it's making people depressed
[3:04:24.280 --> 3:04:29.080]  all part of the dehumanization absolutely so it's a plan obviously but people don't seem to realize
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:32.280]  it and i think it's good though we should just be on our cell phones we actually we shouldn't
[3:04:32.280 --> 3:04:36.920]  be talking on the radio right now we should just be texting well it's racist against texting it is
[3:04:36.920 --> 3:04:41.240]  actually racist well it's kind of a patriarchal deal because it belonged to the past now migrant
[3:04:41.240 --> 3:04:46.680]  textures are what we should be focused on well and again it is a open invasion when you bring in
[3:04:46.680 --> 3:04:51.800]  people and then take people's houses for them that is the definition of genocide that is the
[3:04:51.800 --> 3:04:56.280]  definition of an overwrite which is now happening by the folks that hate our guts that run the
[3:04:56.280 --> 3:05:02.200]  civilization who are mortal enemies joe bigs here with info wars dot com now armed air force vet
[3:05:02.200 --> 3:05:07.160]  was prevented from stopping organ gunman article up by paul joseph watson an air force veteran who
[3:05:07.160 --> 3:05:12.200]  had a license concealed carry gun was prevented by staff from intervening in the shooting yesterday
[3:05:12.200 --> 3:05:16.280]  at the organ community college during which 10 people were killed john parker was situated in
[3:05:16.280 --> 3:05:20.280]  a building about 200 yards away from where the shooting began there were a few people in the
[3:05:20.280 --> 3:05:24.360]  vet center and then we heard the shooting happened we got up and we were going to go over and see
[3:05:24.360 --> 3:05:28.680]  what we could do immediately the school staff stopped us and told us to get inside of the building
[3:05:28.680 --> 3:05:33.160]  essentially the staff wouldn't let us go to assist one courageous man who also tried to
[3:05:33.160 --> 3:05:38.760]  apprehend the shooter army veteran chris mince ended up being shot five times mince was unarmed
[3:05:38.760 --> 3:05:43.400]  in asserting his right to conceal carry parker was knowingly violating a rule which declared the
[3:05:43.400 --> 3:05:50.040]  college to be a gunfree zone this is why we need to arm our students i guarantee you the students
[3:05:50.040 --> 3:05:55.160]  in organ wish they were had the ability to be able to defend themselves and those around them

[3:08:19.960 --> 3:08:26.280]  your host we're going to open up the phone lines cover more news talk about the decline of society
[3:08:26.280 --> 3:08:31.960]  talk about the new relationship killer which is couples not talking to each other anymore
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:38.040]  and just sitting on their cell phone and it's called fubbing and a new study says it's ruining
[3:08:38.040 --> 3:08:43.880]  relationships we're going to talk about google executives saying that with robots in our brains
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:50.680]  will be godlike and a new app that will let you rate real life human beings lots of interesting news
[3:08:51.320 --> 3:09:00.280]  the phone number is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 i'm going to be going to your calls throughout the hour
[3:09:01.080 --> 3:09:06.520]  and you know stories like these remind me and i was just looking at some stories before i came on
[3:09:06.520 --> 3:09:14.120]  the other day about the complete enslavement of our brains on a societal and individual level
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:21.800]  you know it's pretty quick to turn from a consumer to being eaten by the corporations
[3:09:21.800 --> 3:09:27.720]  that we are supposedly consuming and it's about this story to really uh really kind of put me
[3:09:27.720 --> 3:09:32.360]  on that track staples will remain closed on thanksgiving day quote we want our customers and
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:38.520]  associates to enjoy thanksgiving their own way they're closed on thanksgiving day which should be
[3:09:38.520 --> 3:09:44.440]  you know a normal thing but if you think about it you think about the path that we've gone on to
[3:09:44.440 --> 3:09:50.760]  black friday starting the day before starting lines starting two weeks ahead of time just so
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:57.080]  they can save 30 on a television and it really it's messed up at a consumer sense in a corporate
[3:09:57.080 --> 3:10:00.360]  sense in the way that they brainwashed everyone with their marketing techniques that they need
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:05.800]  to get that television in the first place but also think about the reality that we have failed to
[3:10:05.800 --> 3:10:12.840]  even do basic math anymore we can't even understand that let's say the first five people get 40 off
[3:10:12.840 --> 3:10:18.440]  the television that's 300 dollars well then after those five people the deals aren't even that good
[3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:23.640]  because they raise the prices anyway and then the discounts are crap and you end up saving like 20
[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:31.080]  dollars by sitting in a line for hours or days apparently sometimes weeks so it's a cost analysis
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:37.320]  that we can't even do anymore because we have been reduced at such a mindwave level that we can't
[3:10:37.320 --> 3:10:43.800]  even do the most basic levels of analysis it's just like if you will go to a best buy let's say
[3:10:44.440 --> 3:10:50.600]  and oh well well this television for 600 has this feature which is a little bit better than the one
[3:10:50.600 --> 3:10:55.000]  for 400 you're like oh sure well i'll just spend 200 more it's a better television but then you'll
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:03.160]  drive around for 10 extra miles in order to save three cents on gas we can't even do basic valuations
[3:11:03.160 --> 3:11:10.760]  in our brains anymore but it also comes at an individual level fubbing ruining relationship
[3:11:10.760 --> 3:11:15.880]  study says this is from fox news the act of ignoring someone in a social setting by looking
[3:11:15.880 --> 3:11:20.840]  at your phone instead partner phone snubbing is leading to higher levels of depression and
[3:11:20.840 --> 3:11:26.600]  ruining relationships researchers at baler university in texas have found phone snubbing or
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:31.720]  fubbing was found to create conflict among partners leading to low levels of reported
[3:11:31.720 --> 3:11:36.440]  relationship satisfaction these lower levels of relationship satisfaction in turn led to
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:42.840]  lower levels of lot of life satisfaction and ultimately higher levels of depression we can't
[3:11:42.840 --> 3:11:50.760]  even have a conversation with our relationship partners anymore because we're too busy on our
[3:11:50.760 --> 3:11:56.840]  cell phones phone snubbing or fubbing which is such a i kind of like that word now fubbing
[3:11:57.480 --> 3:12:02.520]  you guys are just fubbing everywhere so we're too busy on our cell phones that we can't even hold a
[3:12:02.520 --> 3:12:07.240]  conversation with another human being and it's making people depressed because it feels like
[3:12:07.240 --> 3:12:12.440]  their girlfriends or boyfriends or whatever they don't even pay attention to them anymore
[3:12:12.440 --> 3:12:17.320]  and i see this all the time i was at a restaurant the other day i was sitting there talking to somebody
[3:12:18.040 --> 3:12:21.480]  you know you don't have to talk the entire meal but you look across the across the room and there's
[3:12:21.480 --> 3:12:26.360]  a couple and they don't even talk one time they're too busy taking out their cell phone checking it
[3:12:26.360 --> 3:12:31.400]  compulsively even though no one's probably texting them and then doing whatever using whatever app or
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:36.360]  snapchat or something to the whole entire dinner that they're so locked into the borg system they
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:43.080]  can't even have a real communication with anyone any human being and it kind of reminds me of why
[3:12:43.080 --> 3:12:51.080]  everyone's so afraid of silence have you noticed that everyone everyone is so awkward so awkward
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:55.560]  now they can't even have a real conversation with you and it's partially because everyone is locked
[3:12:55.560 --> 3:13:00.360]  into cell phones and everyone watching others online makes them feel like they have a relationship
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:04.840]  with other people online but they don't have any actual real relationship in the real world but
[3:13:04.840 --> 3:13:09.880]  anyway if you are sitting at a dinner table and there's silence or a regular conversation for
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:14.120]  just a second it gets weird and someone has to take their cell phone out they take out their
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:18.040]  cell phone they start texting like oh my god there's a moment of silence what am i going to do it's
[3:13:18.040 --> 3:13:25.640]  so embarrassing people can't even hold a regular conversation anymore but that's okay because
[3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:33.000]  this google executive says that with robots in our brains will be godlike because the robot cpu's
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:38.200]  that we use in our cell phones are helping us be godlike too it's helping us be social anxiety
[3:13:38.200 --> 3:13:42.840]  driven hive minds google exec with robots in our brains will be godlike this is from cnet
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:48.280]  futurist and google exec ray Kurzweil thinks that once we have robotic implants will be
[3:13:48.280 --> 3:13:52.040]  funnier sexier and more loving because that's what artificial intelligence can do for you
[3:13:53.240 --> 3:13:57.880]  and you know i'm sure if we had chips in our brains there could be some benefits absolutely
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:14:03.000]  but we would most likely be giving away our humanity and just further fubbing ourselves
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:09.320]  as they call it yelp for people app will let you rate real life human beings from entertainment
[3:14:09.320 --> 3:14:14.280]  weekly imagine you're about to go on a first date you yelp the restaurant naturally to make sure
[3:14:14.280 --> 3:14:18.520]  it has something edible on the menu then you google the person naturally to make sure they're not
[3:14:18.520 --> 3:14:23.320]  obnoxious on social media simple enough and it perhaps inevitable new development these two
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:28.600]  perfectly innocuous internet searches are coming together in people p e p l e an app that will
[3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:33.800]  allow you to rate and search other human beings it's yelp for people and it's coming in november
[3:14:34.440 --> 3:14:39.880]  let me tell you why this could be the biggest disaster ever and the worst idea ever because
[3:14:39.880 --> 3:14:49.000]  number one yelp is well known to be highly corrupt and i know people that run businesses and use yelp
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:54.920]  and according to these sources and documentaries that have come out yelp really is a pay for
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:14:59.240]  play type deal in the sense that if you advertise with them they sometimes apparently get rid of
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:05.960]  bad reviews and all such things like that you can look it up online imagine a website that is
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:13.640]  driven by rating other human beings and not only the libel consequences the slander consequences
[3:15:13.640 --> 3:15:18.600]  your ex-girlfriend hates you and wants to write a review about how insane you are and how you
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:24.200]  you know killed the easter bunny or whatever all of the possible things that could go on with the
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:30.200]  payment systems paying for better reviews a popularity contest of the internet totally
[3:15:30.200 --> 3:15:36.600]  insane terrible idea new yelp that will rate people and yeah here's an article think yelp
[3:15:36.600 --> 3:15:41.480]  is unbiased think again from forbes many of us rely on yelp advice on restaurant strike cleaners
[3:15:41.480 --> 3:15:46.600]  retailers handyman blah blah nothing could be farther from the truth in terms this is from
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:51.080]  forbes on their rating system is true it's actually true you can go on and find out that yelp is
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:15:57.800]  pretty much in many people's opinions a major scam grocery carrying robots come with new homes some
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:16:01.960]  of these things are good though i mean you know we could actually use probably grocery carrying
[3:16:01.960 --> 3:16:07.800]  robots but all it does though at the same time as we have these luxuries that we enjoy is further
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:15.160]  devolved us into human caricatures of ourselves that can't do anything like carry our own groceries
[3:16:15.160 --> 3:16:20.920]  we can't do anything like have a real relationship because we're too busy on our cell phones pretending
[3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:26.200]  that we have something to do we're just too busy we're too busy we're too busy we have stuff to do
[3:16:26.200 --> 3:16:31.480]  we can't be talking to real human beings robo cab driverless taxi experiment to start in japan
[3:16:31.480 --> 3:16:35.880]  i've seems like there's every one of these articles seems like it's robots coming in to do more stuff
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:40.920]  driverless taxi experiment to start in japan driverless cars can't even drive anymore we just
[3:16:40.920 --> 3:16:46.200]  can't do anything we really can't we just are just human slug creatures that sit around
[3:16:47.160 --> 3:16:51.480]  and look for brain implants and go on our cell phones and don't talk to other human beings
[3:16:52.440 --> 3:16:56.120]  now let's let's take some calls let's jump into some calls before we go to the break

[3:19:31.000 --> 3:19:37.400]  rather than better and i see worse coming first is how do we deal with the members of our family

[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:17.240]  welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex jones show in overdrive this is anthony gucciardi
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:23.320]  your host for the rest of the hour we're talking about societal decline the collapse of what makes
[3:24:23.320 --> 3:24:28.760]  us really function as human beings the ability to communicate the ability to associate with other
[3:24:28.760 --> 3:24:34.120]  human beings the ability to do things without robots that are going to carry in your groceries
[3:24:34.120 --> 3:24:37.720]  we've got a caller on the line that i want to go back to in a second and she called in
[3:24:38.360 --> 3:24:43.320]  and she was talking about hey i have a husband that just doesn't seem to get it he doesn't seem
[3:24:43.320 --> 3:24:47.320]  to care he doesn't want to be awakened he doesn't he's definitely not awake and he doesn't seem to
[3:24:47.320 --> 3:24:51.640]  be conscious to these things that are going on and it's it's a tough position to be in
[3:24:51.640 --> 3:24:57.720]  it and you know maya is the caller i've been in the exact situation where it's opposite where a
[3:24:57.720 --> 3:25:02.440]  girlfriend of mine really just didn't care you know she thought it was stupid to care and she
[3:25:02.440 --> 3:25:07.480]  kind of bought into the whole system ideology that you know you're just really a nerd if you care
[3:25:07.480 --> 3:25:11.800]  about any of that stuff and history is boring you know and it's not that she was really stupid
[3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:18.280]  or anything like that it was just that it's easy to fall into what the system kind of comforts you
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:25.320]  with that it's okay to just suck on the teat of really system ideology which is everything's fine
[3:25:25.320 --> 3:25:30.120]  let's just go back to sleep it's not a big deal you know most people in the government are just
[3:25:30.120 --> 3:25:35.320]  good the corporations are just good companies make some mistakes sometimes but overall it's
[3:25:35.320 --> 3:25:41.400]  overall fine you're just making a big deal out of nothing and not to you know i mean ultimately
[3:25:41.400 --> 3:25:46.200]  we have to have a good outlook overall that we're going to have victory and that there are a lot of
[3:25:46.200 --> 3:25:51.400]  good people out there but it's also it's it's silly to not identify the problems that our are
[3:25:51.400 --> 3:25:57.160]  going on so we can actually go ahead and fix them maya you were talking about your husband not
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:03.080]  getting it and i think there are ways in which you can help that obviously by showing him something
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:07.480]  that he can be passionate about because most people the problem i find is they're just not
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:12.360]  passionate about anything so when they sit there and they say everything's fine or you know you're
[3:26:12.360 --> 3:26:16.520]  crazy or whatever it's because they've never actually found something that they're passionate
[3:26:16.520 --> 3:26:21.560]  about doing so they don't understand that drive that you have to help people and inform other people
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:26.840]  there is definitely a war on our ability whether it's from the hunt the health front
[3:26:26.840 --> 3:26:32.440]  with the toxic substances we're exposed to on a daily basis dumbing us down or the ideological
[3:26:32.440 --> 3:26:37.320]  front which it's really it's really tough to not get brought into the comfort of watching
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:41.800]  television all day my so tell us what happens when you talk to your husband and you say hey look
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:49.320]  things are going on does he just not care say you're crazy what happens hello hey yep oh okay great
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:54.280]  okay yeah i wanted to try and stop you because i agree with you i think that is partially what's
[3:26:54.280 --> 3:27:01.480]  happening but i also think what's happening is uh the reality that with everything that's being
[3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:06.680]  put upon america today and i also believe that a good portion of it is intentional
[3:27:06.680 --> 3:27:13.880]  that we that a lot of americans have become so overloaded that they choose not to think
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:19.800]  they're they're not denying what's happening but their their brain is just shutting down
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:26.440]  and it's almost easier it's the frog in the pot syndrome oh it's 100 right i mean if you work a
[3:27:26.440 --> 3:27:31.480]  nine to five job if you wake up in the morning and you have to get ready you have to you know do
[3:27:31.480 --> 3:27:35.720]  your daily routine take the dogs out whatever go to work it yell that by your boss all day or
[3:27:35.720 --> 3:27:39.560]  whatever you do when you're nine to five and it's tough and it really exert your brain you're using
[3:27:39.560 --> 3:27:42.600]  your brain all day you're not in a conscious state you're not trying to do things that are
[3:27:42.600 --> 3:27:46.680]  actually beneficial to you you don't worry about your own growth or anything like that you're just
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:50.440]  kind of giving yourself up to the nine to five corporation then you get home and what do you
[3:27:50.440 --> 3:27:54.200]  have to do you have to deal with your relationship you have to deal with the home stuff your house
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:58.040]  is falling apart you don't have money you got to pay taxes you don't have money for the bills
[3:27:58.040 --> 3:28:02.360]  all those things are absolutely going to hit you like a brick in the head and there's not a lot of
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:08.520]  energy left after that you're also you're stuck then with the reality that the world is going to
[3:28:08.520 --> 3:28:15.480]  hell in a handbasket that there's a president who seems to be not incompetent as a matter of fact
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:21.000]  i'm someone who insists that this is not incompetence that we're looking at but we're looking but we
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:30.120]  are watching as all of the things that um even at their most imperfect we relied on and trust it in
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:36.520]  because of the constitution because of the documents that that made this country possible
[3:28:37.320 --> 3:28:42.360]  we're watching it being dismantled and and then we're watching the servants who are supposed
[3:28:42.360 --> 3:28:49.480]  to be working for us turn around and actually provide the ammunition to do it and nothing
[3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:53.960]  is more defeating than the feeling that you can't do anything about it there's nothing in this world
[3:28:53.960 --> 3:29:00.600]  is more defeating just like a plane going down than the concept of understanding that there's
[3:29:00.600 --> 3:29:06.040]  nothing i can do about this problem that is the worst feeling in the world and that's why millions
[3:29:06.040 --> 3:29:10.440]  of people are depressed and feel like crap every single day after they get home and they have to
[3:29:10.440 --> 3:29:14.440]  go through work all day they don't have enough money and then they get home and they realize the
[3:29:14.440 --> 3:29:19.320]  system is so screwed up they realize that an article that just flashed on screen i remember
[3:29:19.320 --> 3:29:22.840]  this woman was told by her psychologist to pour bleach in her eyes because she wanted to be blind
[3:29:22.840 --> 3:29:27.640]  she was mentally ill talk about the robot ships in our brain all this crazy stuff how are you

[3:30:43.080 --> 3:30:49.240]  million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to cover up that disaster epa officials

[3:33:13.400 --> 3:33:18.760]  aware of it and they'll say there's nothing going on and i want to say put on these glasses or start
[3:33:18.760 --> 3:33:33.640]  q and concrete they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders they have recruited the rich and the powerful
[3:33:33.640 --> 3:33:39.640]  and they have blinded us to the truth the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what
[3:33:39.640 --> 3:33:47.160]  i want to address to our guests tonight impulses are being redirected we are living in an artificially
[3:33:47.160 --> 3:33:54.520]  induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep an estimated 50 to 70 million americans suffer
[3:33:54.520 --> 3:34:02.120]  from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation outside the limit of our sight feeding office
[3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:09.400]  preach on top of us from birth to death our owners latest census numbers prove the united
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:15.000]  states has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries today our
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:21.880]  projections show that by the year 2025 not only america but the entire planet will be under the
[3:34:21.880 --> 3:34:28.840]  protection and the dominion of this power alliance the gains have been substantial both for ourselves
[3:34:29.560 --> 3:34:32.360]  and for you the human power elite
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:41.080]  and for the first time in all of human history
[3:34:43.480 --> 3:34:50.520]  mankind is politically awakened that's a total new reality i've got one that can see
[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:58.120]  we can't be the only ones who can see unfortunately you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly
[3:34:58.120 --> 3:35:03.080]  warn of government is nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got at the root
[3:35:03.080 --> 3:35:12.200]  of all our problems it's a new morning in america fresh vital the old cynicism is gone we have faith
[3:35:12.200 --> 3:35:20.840]  in our leaders we're optimistic as to what becomes of it all it really boils down to our ability to
[3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:31.640]  accept we don't need pessimism i have two words for you predator drones
[3:35:34.200 --> 3:35:39.880]  we will never see it coming don't predict the first guy who uses a second amendment weapon
[3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:44.040]  to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is going to be a folk hero in this
[3:35:44.040 --> 3:35:52.760]  country and there is a single broadcast every second of every day through our television sets
[3:35:52.760 --> 3:35:59.800]  i'm just trying to warn you folks the television is a giant led weapon system it's so advanced
[3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:04.920]  they got a monkey farm in bass drop folks that he also works testing on great apes
[3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:08.680]  Reese's monkeys the whole nine yards and they go oh you didn't see this and punch a button into
[3:36:08.680 --> 3:36:12.520]  beating hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them
[3:36:12.520 --> 3:36:20.920]  as well i ever have to do is be famous people watch me and i love me you can have a little
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:26.600]  taste of that good life too now i know you want it hell everybody does do it to your own kind
[3:36:27.640 --> 3:36:34.040]  what's the threat we all sell out every day might as well be on the winning team the real men of
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:42.920]  the world have to stand up and say i have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass and i'm all
[3:36:42.920 --> 3:36:51.160]  out of bubble gum time to take a stand boys you know what you got a little courage stand up for
[3:36:51.160 --> 3:37:00.360]  yourself the waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:15.480]  the info war the after winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat that's right
[3:37:15.480 --> 3:37:21.800]  it is time to stand up and it is time to trick your reality into your own hands and this is
[3:37:21.800 --> 3:37:27.560]  anthony gutiarty for the fourth hour overdrive of the alex jones show last segment we took a caller
[3:37:27.560 --> 3:37:31.800]  who was talking about her significant other not wanting to be awakened not caring about being
[3:37:31.800 --> 3:37:37.640]  conscious not caring about what was going on and we talked about how a lot of us work all day and
[3:37:37.640 --> 3:37:43.240]  we don't have enough energy at the end of the day to even care and at the same time we feel defeated
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:50.760]  because of all the insanity that's going on i believe that it is extremely challenging to
[3:37:50.760 --> 3:37:54.360]  overcome the feeling of defeat with all the madness i mean we talked about earlier the
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:59.640]  chips that are going to go in our brains the tribalist cars the grocery-carrying robots that
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:04.120]  coming with new homes science says the cell phone use could be hurting a relationship thubbing is
[3:38:04.120 --> 3:38:08.520]  the new thing that people can't even talk to their friends and family because they're too busy on
[3:38:08.520 --> 3:38:14.680]  their cell phones and is ruining their relationships ultimately i believe the answer is to at an
[3:38:14.680 --> 3:38:21.240]  individual level be completely free of the system and that doesn't not mean going off the grid you
[3:38:21.240 --> 3:38:25.720]  know not getting anything all we can still all enjoy ourselves and and and not be completely
[3:38:25.720 --> 3:38:30.920]  insane but getting out of the system's ideology that you're not worth enough because you are
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:35.000]  worth enough and you are powerful enough to do what it ever ever it is that you want to do
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:40.760]  if you want to do something like starting on business spend 20 minutes a day towards doing
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:46.680]  that the system's main weapon is telling you that you are worthless and that keeps you controlled
[3:38:46.680 --> 3:38:53.880]  and conformed because it molds you into an enslaved human being that unfortunately many
[3:38:53.880 --> 3:38:59.880]  of which exist on this planet speaking of enslaved human beings rake hers while also has a message
[3:38:59.880 --> 3:39:05.240]  that he would like to tell you and that is the next level of human enslavement is coming with
[3:39:05.240 --> 3:39:11.400]  brain chips let's listen to that video we create our tools to extend our reach we couldn't reach
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:16.440]  that fruit at that high branch a thousand years ago so we fashioned a tool we then were able to create
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:23.480]  new tools with those tools created a whole nother evolutionary process and we will literally expand
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:29.240]  not only the size of our neocontext but the number of levels of abstraction and those
[3:39:29.240 --> 3:39:34.680]  additional levels we added two million years ago enabled us to create music and art and humor
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:39.640]  this is billions of times more powerful than the computer i use this in undergraduate per dollar
[3:39:39.640 --> 3:39:45.160]  but that's not even the most interesting thing about it if i want to access 10 000 computers
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:50.760]  for two seconds i can do that wirelessly and multiplies itself in the cloud 10 000 fold
[3:39:50.760 --> 3:39:57.400]  that's what we're going to do with our neocortex so i'm walking along and i see like a page coming
[3:39:57.400 --> 3:40:02.680]  and say uh i better think of something clever to say my 300 million modules and my neocortex
[3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:08.520]  isn't going to cut it i need a billion for two seconds i'll be able to access that in the cloud
[3:40:08.520 --> 3:40:15.640]  just like i can multiply the intelligence of my smartphone thousands full today and we're going
[3:40:15.640 --> 3:40:22.680]  to add additional levels of abstraction and create more profound means of expression so we're
[3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:27.880]  going to be more musical we're going to be funnier we're going to be sexier we're going to be better
[3:40:27.880 --> 3:40:36.120]  at expressing loving sentiments that's my vision of what we'll do with AI evolution creates structures
[3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:44.200]  and patterns that over time are more complicated more knowledgeable more intelligent more creative
[3:40:44.200 --> 3:40:51.320]  more capable of expressing higher sentiments like being loving so it's moving in the direction
[3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:58.120]  that god has been described as having these qualities without limit and so i think evolution
[3:40:58.120 --> 3:41:04.840]  is a spiritual process it makes us more godlike and there is beauty and love and creativity
[3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:11.560]  intelligence in the world it all comes from the neocortex um and we're going to be able to expand
[3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:17.320]  the neocortex as i described so we're going to become more godlike we're all going to become gods
[3:41:17.320 --> 3:41:23.720]  with the new computer microchips implanted in your brain by ray Kurzweil you know i'm not anti
[3:41:23.720 --> 3:41:27.240]  advancements when it comes to science and technology i think it's great i'm all about
[3:41:27.240 --> 3:41:32.200]  optimization that's why i try and have a super good health regimen i try and take supplements that
[3:41:32.200 --> 3:41:36.840]  really boost your brain power i try to do morning routines every single day and exercise in the
[3:41:36.840 --> 3:41:42.040]  right ways i'm all about optimization even productivity optimization i use all the apps
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:46.040]  that i need to enhance my productivity and i love scientific advancement i actually like
[3:41:46.040 --> 3:41:51.240]  driverless cars if it could be trusted and you know i like a lot of things that are advancements
[3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:56.120]  that can be sometimes scary but when it comes to putting computer chips in your brain that are owned
[3:41:56.120 --> 3:42:01.400]  and operated by a company that is a for-profit corporation that's been caught in the past
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:08.360]  doing some questionable things and integrated into a cloud which is basically a free sharing
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:15.000]  flow of information that is stored on their servers that obviously is extremely questionable
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:19.080]  but then once it starts turning into well we're going to become gods through this technology
[3:42:19.080 --> 3:42:25.720]  that's when it definitely turns much more cult-like and there's a reason that super
[3:42:25.720 --> 3:42:31.880]  intellectual powerful thinkers like elon musk have already taken a stand as well as top professors
[3:42:31.880 --> 3:42:37.480]  at universities and thousands of others who have signed along with his petition to go up against the
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:43.800]  out of control creation of artificial intelligence because it's not a game with the creation of
[3:42:43.800 --> 3:42:49.400]  artificial intelligence in such of the ways that race curse curse while eventually i believe it appears
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:55.560]  wants to do it's not a fun game to mess with and it's you're not anti-intellectual if you
[3:42:55.560 --> 3:42:59.560]  go up against and say hey i don't really want to have artificial intelligence in every single
[3:43:00.120 --> 3:43:04.120]  part of my life that would ultimately control my brain and take away myself
[3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:09.160]  and assimilate me into some Borek AI creature that is not the game that i want to play
[3:43:09.160 --> 3:43:12.920]  and i think most americans that have their head on straight would agree with that
[3:43:12.920 --> 3:43:16.600]  let's go to some calls and talk about some different subjects and some more news
[3:43:16.600 --> 3:43:21.000]  let's go and talk to organic warrior in california what is on your mind
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  yeah i just wanted to touch base about the hawaii state of hawaii and the corruption that is running
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:36.440]  deep in hawaii right now and i think it's very important that the people leading by example
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:41.640]  over there are doing sustainable farming but they're getting squeezed out by the federalization of
[3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:49.400]  dupont sagenta pioneer they're poisoning hawaii with the gmo ground level testing over there
[3:43:49.400 --> 3:43:55.160]  they've been doing it for 15 years and i think the hawaiian people are pretty much getting
[3:43:55.160 --> 3:44:00.360]  sick of it and they want their sovereign hawaii back they want to take their their state back
[3:44:00.360 --> 3:44:04.920]  and it's been there for a hundred years they've occupied over there and you know they're leading
[3:44:04.920 --> 3:44:12.200]  by example for the rest of the world and you know touching bases basically uh yeah i just i just
[3:44:12.200 --> 3:44:16.600]  wanted to ask you what do you think about that or have you heard anything about hawaii or
[3:44:16.600 --> 3:44:21.880]  you know i know a lot of hawaiians i mean specifically in malay where they enacted anti gmo laws
[3:44:22.520 --> 3:44:28.120]  are fed up for good reason and we should all be fed up though because of the dark act which is
[3:44:28.120 --> 3:44:32.520]  coming and apparently it's going to be voted on october 7th by the senate so it's an act it's
[3:44:33.160 --> 3:44:38.520]  ironically called the safe and accurate food labeling act and what it does is it bans gmo
[3:44:38.520 --> 3:44:44.760]  labeling from states states can't ban states can't enact mandatory gmo labeling but it bans it at a
[3:44:44.760 --> 3:44:51.160]  federal level level so it would already pass the house and amazingly right most of you probably
[3:44:51.160 --> 3:44:55.400]  don't even know what it is against the dark acts but now it's going to the senate so it may soon
[3:44:55.400 --> 3:44:59.960]  become a law i guess next week they're set to vote on it so that could become a law and they'll just
[3:44:59.960 --> 3:45:06.120]  say states you're not allowed to mandatory label gmo's anymore so that would not only affect hawaii
[3:45:06.120 --> 3:45:11.000]  that would affect all the 50 states and we would literally not be able to know what's in our food
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:17.960]  anymore so there is definitely a statewide fight in hawaii there is vermont enacted mandatory gmo
[3:45:17.960 --> 3:45:24.120]  labeling but if this dark act passes we will no longer be able to know at the state level
[3:45:24.120 --> 3:45:29.560]  if we're eating gmo's anymore in our food and in fact doing so would be illegal so states like
[3:45:29.560 --> 3:45:35.800]  texas has a gmo labeling bill that's set to be voted on if they pass it then the fed would come in
[3:45:35.800 --> 3:45:40.040]  and say well that's actually illegal you're not allowed to label genetically modified organisms
[3:45:40.040 --> 3:45:45.400]  from monsanto that are in the food supply even if your health experts say that it's a good idea
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:51.080]  or that 95 plus percent of the united states wants gmo labeling that's too bad it does not matter
[3:45:51.080 --> 3:45:58.120]  and of course there's a reason that 96 plus percent of monsanto shareholders when asked in a vote
[3:45:58.120 --> 3:46:04.440]  if they would like to label gmo's said absolutely not see 96 percent of the shareholders of monsanto
[3:46:04.440 --> 3:46:10.520]  don't want to label it but 95 plus percent of the united states public wants it labeled you see the
[3:46:10.520 --> 3:46:15.960]  disparity there right it's obvious that if monsanto had a product that was so great they should
[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:20.120]  want to label it they should be proud there should be a whole section of gmo's in the grocery store
[3:46:20.120 --> 3:46:25.320]  so we can all know we're getting such an amazing product from the helm of monsanto where 90 plus
[3:46:25.320 --> 3:46:31.160]  percent of the corn supply is uniquely modified all right let's go to the next caller let's talk
[3:46:31.160 --> 3:46:39.480]  to paul in new mexico paul are you there yeah i wanted to say like uh i think society we're just
[3:46:39.480 --> 3:46:44.840]  like uh we're drinkers we're not thinkers anymore we just we want to be distracted because if we
[3:46:44.840 --> 3:46:50.440]  look inside ourselves we might not like what we see we're afraid to get in that quiet place and
[3:46:50.440 --> 3:46:58.040]  think about our lives because if we did that we might be uh not like what we see you know what i'm
[3:46:58.040 --> 3:47:04.360]  saying absolutely we have an ego in our brain that you know kind of constructs ourselves and our our
[3:47:04.360 --> 3:47:10.600]  identities based on our experiences in life and sometimes in a calm contemplative state we freak
[3:47:10.600 --> 3:47:16.520]  out and experience some craziness because we can't come to terms with our own realities and i've had
[3:47:16.520 --> 3:47:20.680]  to do that time and time again it's one of the hardest things you can do is to actually sit down
[3:47:20.680 --> 3:47:25.480]  and analyze yourself because you might not like what you see like you just said and that's why not
[3:47:25.480 --> 3:47:30.840]  just alcohol why drinking alcohol feels great because it turns your brain off it makes you more
[3:47:30.840 --> 3:47:35.400]  present in the moment it makes you able a lot of times some people it just makes it more upset
[3:47:35.400 --> 3:47:40.600]  but for a lot of people it makes them happier and it makes them enjoy themselves more because their
[3:47:40.600 --> 3:47:45.400]  brain that always wants to be in the future or the past is shut off for a little while so the
[3:47:45.400 --> 3:47:51.000]  number one cause of stress is wanting to do something that you're not able to do at that moment
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:54.120]  wanting to go in the past and fix something wanting to go in the future you know what about the
[3:47:54.120 --> 3:47:58.040]  future what's going to be crazy what am i going to do or reminiscing about the past in your brain
[3:47:58.040 --> 3:48:02.760]  you're having your own internal dialogue all day for like 24 hours a day even you wake up in the
[3:48:02.760 --> 3:48:06.280]  middle of the night i can't sleep why can't you sleep because you have your own internal dialogue
[3:48:06.280 --> 3:48:13.800]  in your brain so what do we do we satiate the body's desire to turn that off by drinking alcohol by
[3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:19.160]  eating comfort foods that make us feel good by watching television which shuts our brain off
[3:48:19.160 --> 3:48:23.560]  by playing video games whatever it is and all these things in moderation not a bad thing but as
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:28.360]  long as you understand that when you have a chronic addiction to any of those things you're turning
[3:48:28.360 --> 3:48:33.960]  your brain off because you just can't handle actually thinking about all of it and i understand
[3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:39.400]  and i feel for the people do that and i've done that before in my life because it is crazy out there
[3:48:39.400 --> 3:48:44.440]  all the stuff we talk about on a daily basis it's easy to want to shut your brain off it's easy
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:48.600]  to want to go home and turn on the television and just sit there and stare at it and not think for
[3:48:48.600 --> 3:48:53.720]  a little while and sometimes that is therapeutic but ultimately it's better to come to terms and talk
[3:48:53.720 --> 3:48:57.800]  to yourself really in an inner dialogue and understand that hey you don't have to worry
[3:48:57.800 --> 3:49:02.520]  all all day long you don't have to be frantic and be crazy and you don't have to feel defeated
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:07.080]  because we are actually rising up against the evil in this planet we are actually having a great
[3:49:07.080 --> 3:49:11.880]  victory and humanity really really is coming together because just as things are getting so
[3:49:11.880 --> 3:49:16.920]  terrible and worse than we've ever seen before with a possibility of world war three escalating
[3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:21.080]  every single day and nuclear threats and ices saying they're going to cleanse the planet all
[3:49:21.080 --> 3:49:26.440]  this crazy stuff there is a deep escalation of good and the mainstream media fails to ever look
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:32.280]  at that good they totally totally do they only want to harp on the negativity every single day
[3:49:32.280 --> 3:49:38.280]  on ices and all that kind of stuff and they fail to cover the fact that just listeners of this
[3:49:38.280 --> 3:49:43.480]  broadcast the millions that are listening to this broadcast overall are good people that want
[3:49:43.480 --> 3:49:49.640]  real action and just want to save this country and if we just understood the masses of people
[3:49:49.640 --> 3:49:55.240]  that could come together and do that in a peaceful way we would have amazing victories by tomorrow
[3:49:55.800 --> 3:50:01.560]  but unfortunately we are so divided from our brothers and sisters in this actual fight that
[3:50:01.560 --> 3:50:08.840]  we ultimately are not achieving that in a large way but we are breaking away like a chisel on a
[3:50:08.840 --> 3:50:14.040]  mountain we are just breaking away and sometimes we get a bulldoze and we just hit a huge chunk out
[3:50:14.040 --> 3:50:19.720]  of that mountain and ultimately we are achieving victory thank you for your call let's go to

[3:54:16.440 --> 3:54:21.400]  for the remainder of the program and it's been a jam-packed show we talked about a lot of interesting
[3:54:21.400 --> 3:54:25.800]  things we took a lot of interesting calls we are going to finish up with one more caller but first
[3:54:25.800 --> 3:54:31.720]  i want to tell you that this entire show is made possible by your support alex does not receive
[3:54:31.720 --> 3:54:37.480]  funding from outside sources like the government unlike many news corporations out there so you
[3:54:37.480 --> 3:54:42.840]  can go to info warslife.com and check out the flagship products on there including survival
[3:54:42.840 --> 3:54:48.600]  shield x2 nascent iodine which of course is the flagship leader of the info warslife brand
[3:54:48.600 --> 3:54:56.920]  it is true super powerful ultra nascent iodine from 8 to 12,000 feet below the earth's surface
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:55:02.520]  it's taken from purple salt crystals it sounds it sounds insane but it's actually 100 true massive
[3:55:02.520 --> 3:55:07.960]  drills go underneath the earth's surface and drill out purple iodine crystals and then we take
[3:55:07.960 --> 3:55:13.160]  those and we extract the iodine because it's the salt crystals that are 200 plus million years old
[3:55:13.160 --> 3:55:18.760]  we take them out we screen them for radiation and then we create the survival shield x2 here's a
[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:26.600]  couple of the reviews from the info warslife.com product page this is from blynne i've had iodine
[3:55:26.600 --> 3:55:33.400]  issues for a while but this has helped greatly in improving my energy levels thank you and good
[3:55:33.960 --> 3:55:39.080]  self me sometimes i really love the names the drops under the tongue every morning followed by
[3:55:39.080 --> 3:55:44.680]  sips of water is how i take my nascent iodine in months past my 71 years was producing long
[3:55:44.680 --> 3:55:50.360]  pauses between some words this says since this has lifted since taking iodine for just one week
[3:55:51.160 --> 3:55:56.600]  that is amazing and i have had similar experiences taking the survival shield x2 nascent iodine which
[3:55:56.600 --> 3:56:01.080]  i take every single morning in my protein shake the taste doesn't bother me but i still just put it
[3:56:01.080 --> 3:56:05.800]  into the shake and drink it in first thing in the morning with the super male vitality and all the
[3:56:05.800 --> 3:56:10.840]  other products in info wars life and i want to finish up in the quick couple minutes we've got
[3:56:10.840 --> 3:56:16.760]  left with Doug let him finish his point Doug you were talking about how the newest generations are
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:22.920]  raised on television and assimilated into the board quite quickly go ahead oh yeah and you know
[3:56:22.920 --> 3:56:28.920]  they they don't understand that they've been conditioned and if they use something that's
[3:56:28.920 --> 3:56:36.040]  been around forever reversed psychology or the peewee herman theory i know you are but what am i
[3:56:36.680 --> 3:56:42.680]  you know we bombard them back with the information they're throwing at us so it's either going to
[3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:47.960]  negate it or they're going to start looking at the other end when you fight back with them if we
[3:56:47.960 --> 3:56:55.560]  just lay back and let them do whatever they want and make everything racist everything about stupidity
[3:56:55.560 --> 3:57:02.360]  you know people ask they say how can i fight this how can i help how many people have laser printers
[3:57:02.360 --> 3:57:11.000]  and and desktop printers at home make a list of verifiable facts print them out go to your
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:17.960]  shopping center put them on windows absolutely everybody's gonna look at it but that's the
[3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:23.720]  simplest way to do it and just taking and just taking one second to share something on social
[3:57:23.720 --> 3:57:30.360]  media just going to any website that has powerful information whether there is info worse.com or my
[3:57:30.360 --> 3:57:35.000]  websites anything that is powerful and sharing it on social media it takes one second but it
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:39.400]  could reach millions of people because once something actually really goes viral and gets
[3:57:39.400 --> 3:57:45.480]  shared out on facebook it can truly change the perspective of the entire planet and i've seen
[3:57:45.480 --> 3:57:50.920]  that firsthand and i have participated in doing so firsthand thank you for your call dug i think
[3:57:50.920 --> 3:57:55.080]  ultimately every generation has the ability to stand up and decide that they're not going to take
[3:57:55.080 --> 3:58:01.240]  it anymore and to join the ideological revolution thanks so much for joining us on this fourth hour
[3:58:01.240 --> 3:58:07.320]  of overdrive on the alex jones show alex will be back this sunday at 4 p.m central standard time

[3:58:13.080 --> 3:58:18.520]  more news i'm sure whole want to cover including some more crazy stuff on patients exposure to toxic
[3:58:18.520 --> 3:58:24.120]  compounds causing cancer diabetes sanjay gupta is admitting it bacteria reducing risk of asthma
[3:58:24.120 --> 3:58:49.720]  the list goes on thanks so much for joining the program i'm anthony gutierre
